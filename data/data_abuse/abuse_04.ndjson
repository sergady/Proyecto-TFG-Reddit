I feel like I\u2019m drowning in this. I always have something else I want to say. I always have something else I want to hear. I never feel ready to let it go. I have been able to so many times and felt so good about it only to txt him a few days later bc I was worried he was too sad and maybe I\u2019m just crazy and he isn\u2019t an emotionally abusive narc. He is tho. I see it now and still I\u2019m bonded. The mask totally came off over the weekend and he screamed the most horrible things at me. He called me crazy. And psycho. His voice was so cold and angry. Everything he said to me over an hour and a half is still ringing in my ears. I can literally hear it all day long. Anytime I start to cry I hear him yelling \u201cyour just playing the victim\u201d and to \u201cman up\u201d \u201cget over it, I don\u2019t want to talk to you\u201d ... after a week of him apologizing bc he wanted to talk to me. I had decided to take a break and let him contact me after he had gone to the doctor bc of the way he apologized and seemed to own all the terrible things he had said and done. Then a switch flipped over such a small thing. I was fully expecting to wake up the next day to an apology, which I could have easily accepted and then blocked him. But instead I woke up to nothing. Later in the day I\u2019m so confused. I txt him to ask him what he meant about threatening to hunt me down. I was blocked. He blocked ME. I\u2019m so confused. All these terrible things he screamed at me he must have meant, it wasn\u2019t just a drunken rage, it was fully him. I\u2019m so lost. I\u2019m drowning. I want to know why he snapped and how he could say what he did and get a read about whether or not I should feel scared about the threats he made. But I can\u2019t.

One of the librarians told me that she could see right through his calm demeanor and saw how manipulative he was being. The other one encouraged me to document everything and held my hand.

So, yesterday, as we celebrated 12 glorious years of wedded bliss (truthfully, I was largely unaware of the bliss part, as it was covert, and our blisses aren't aligned anyhow) he began having chest pains. So, we go to the ER, and man oh man, does he love him some ER. They took his shirt off! And stuck things all over him! Look!! Pardon my glee for moment, but his cardiac enzymes are rising and they are keeping him overnight.  Sweet! A break for me! \n\nThis morning he is still in the ICU. I pack a bag, text a few people the news, and head in to see him. Our son would prefer to stay home and play Xbox, and I dont push it, read into that what you will. \n\nWhen I arrive, dutiful wife \"get well soon\" gifts in tow  (I am the senior manager of this outfit), I am treated to the grand tour of the ICU, the bathroom down the hall, the cart in the hallway that holds the jugs he used to need to...the needles of blood thinners he received, everything but what the doctor said.  Dont recall what the doctor said, honey, but did you see this bed? Now, at this point one could surmise that this is the ramblings of a jealous, crazy woman. But hear me out: after his daughter and her boyfriend arrive I squeeze them both with hugs and fuck off outta there. He still hasn't bothered to do up his hospital gown, which he prefers open to the front, natch, with his trackies underneath. Whatever man. A little while later, as I am hitting a bong (an unnecessary detail, but its legal here and I am enjoying my ersatz vacation) his son texts me, as he and his girlfriend came up to see him too, and want to pop over for a tea and a visit. This, dear, patient readers, is where my concerns take wing: my somatic king cannot seems to manage to find the ties to his hospital gown, forgoing modesty and propriety to instead insist that **his son's girlfriend** regard his chest, ensuring she will by not just commenting on his luxurious shag rug of chest hair, but, after she has regarded its magnificence, king calls upon her to compare his chest as superior to that of his own grown son. What a tool. \n\nHe also insisted that his children AND their respective SO's to gaze fondly upon the chair on which he, well, poops. Now, I am no prude, but to hear my step-sons girlfriend relate to me that my husband bragged about his poop chair, I quite nearly died of embarrassment. He is 45 goddamned years old, can someone please inform him of such?  \n\nAnd that is where I left him. He asked if I was coming up after supper (don't wanna, fuck you) and I played the poop chair card, by saying I had tea with your kid after, and there was talk of a poop chair, and that's where I tap out, my friend.

I'm trying to make sense of a \"relationship\" I've been out of for five months. I don't want to label this person a full-blown narcissist, but knowing whether or not these may be some tendencies of it might give me some of the clarity, closure and validation that I so desperately need right now. My apologies for the long, potentially upsetting post. I just truly feel that I don't have another place to turn right now. I do plan on going to therapy soon for unrelated reasons, but I'll bring this up. In the interim, I could really use some Reddit support right now.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMe (20F) and him (19M) are still \"friends\" and we're a part of three different organizations together, and we live very close to each other (college dorms). We have a ton of the same friends- pretty much every single one of my close friends knows him. He's gently flirted with me for as long as I can remember (October 2017), some very direct flirtation began about May, a date happened around June, the \"relationship\" started early September and ended late October.\n\nWhen we first got \"together\" (quotes because nothing was ever official, but without context, you honestly could have thought that it was.), it was him making all of the moves- I was, actually, completely uninterested in him at first. He was always charming, seductive even, took me out on a \"date\" one day after one of my rehearsals (he then made a move on my friend, but I thought nothing of it as I wasn't actually interested in him yet.)\n\nEverything all /really/ started one night when I got too drunk, opened up to him about my alcoholic father (probably my #1 weakness at the time), and we went back to our friend's room to cuddle for hours on end, with him whispering to me that i was safe, etc. Not long after that we escalated to making out, eventually some sexual activity (never actual sex, we're both still virgins, which I think might be relevant). Almost immediately treating me like an absolute princess. Still can't hear the word \"gorgeous\" without all the memories flooding back, all of the times he used to call me that. He started confiding in me, about his health issues, about some sort of will/end-of-life note that he has written, about his best friend's sexual assault, etc. We didn't really label ourselves, just \"friends that made out\", but that was mostly because of my own fears that I was slowly trying to let go of, for unrelated reasons. He seemed very interested in me, and I thought we were on our way to being something.\n\nThat all changed very quickly. That first night was at the beginning of September, and around the middle-end of October, after we had hooked up about 4-5 times, he just, boom. Lost all interest. Threw me away completely. I thought that maybe he was just going through something in his own life (the bad family life he has, the sexual assault of his best friend, it could have been anything), so I tried to stick around, tried to initiate what he used to. Just, simply tried to cuddle with him once or twice. He did not have it at ALL, as if he's the only one allowed to initiate anything.\n\nI would never wish the aftermath of this on anyone. He began to make \"jokes\" (his words) about our past sexual history in front of our friends, STILL does that to this day by the way. Apparently it was \"cute when I TRIED to be sexy\". He always talks to me about whatever girl he's with now, KNOWING it will almost definitely spark jealousy (Flirt is this man's middle name, I swear to God.) He's always pushing the virginity thing, saying he's \"waiting for the right person\" (our relationship ended, in my opinion, right before we were about to escalate to having sex. I definitely wouldn't want to push him into uncomfortable territory, of COURSE, but I just find this odd.) He's pushed away other people in similar ways, too; he no longer has a relationship with one of our friends anymore, because he'll do this kind of stuff to anyone. Another friend of ours, one of the sweetest people I know, mentioned being a victim of this too. (but of course it's worse for me, the sexually involved.)\n\nHe, also, as a STEM major, NEVER misses the chance to joke about how I'm going to be couch surfing for the rest of my life as a Theatre Arts major. Not a day or two ever seem to go by without him making a joke at someone else's expense to inflate his own ego, which, for reasons I'll describe, I don't think is actually that big internally. It's been FIVE MONTHS of this shit now.\n\nThe worst part of it is that I am still somehow convinced he has an extraordinary capability to be a good person. He always knows how to comfort someone in an emergency, He is VERY involved in numerous charity organizations. He seems to always want to focus on service projects dedicated towards suicide prevention, so of course I'm always worried about him, too. He always seems to be excluded from the group of guy friends on our floor, he's always talking about how poorly his dad treats him... you get the idea. I worry about him CONSTANTLY.\n\nThe most confusing thing is that everyone said that these behaviors subsided when I was with him. MULTIPLE mutual friends of ours said that there was a period of a few weeks while we were together that he was \"actually a nice person\". That one hurts. That one hurts like a knife to multiple vital organs.\n\nI just want to escape this painful limbo, but there's no way that this person is leaving my life any time soon, and frankly, I really don't want him to. I just want my old life back. I do think I still love him, but I would like to go back to even before our relationship, if it has to be that way. I just want to feel safe around him again. He always said that he would never make me cry again, that he would always make me feel safe. Those were probably the most special, most comforting words I'd ever heard from anyone. I guess he lied to me about that, though. I'm sure my friends are so exhausted hearing about him, hearing about my problems. I know better than to say that it's all my fault, but I can't help but think that way.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhat is this behavior? And what can I do to help myself that isn't cutting him off completely? Because, frankly, that's completely impossible right now. Even if it weren't, I still don't think I could bare to lose him. That might be the worst part.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n(Edited some identifying info out (his major, some details of our friends), just in case anyone I know IRL stumbles upon this post.)", "subreddit": "NarcissisticAbuse"}

I have been with my boyfriend for four years, he has known about the abuse for one year.

When I feel pain in sexual contexts, I try to quickly make a joke out of it because the alternative is that I shut down, either dissociate and feel numb, or feel sick and panicky. So I laughed and told him that he couldn\u2019t just rip it off my body, he had to ease it off by the straps; he felt that I was making fun of him, and his voice got chilly and angry and he rolled off me. The sudden shift of tone and also the fact that I had not successfully deflected the trauma response with humor made me start crying, and he held onto me, and seemed to understand. \n\nAbout an hour later, I tried to kiss him again, but he avoided it-- he seemed very uncomfortable. I felt stupid because I just wanted to be normal again, to forget about the Ugly Thing that made things weird earlier, and be a couple in bed again-- like we normally do. He shrugged me off, and we laid there more. It felt polite, and obligatory, the way he was lying beside me, not saying anything and not touching me. I wondered if the only reason he didn\u2019t get up and walk out is because he thought that it was his duty to lie by me after the trigger response. So I asked him what he was thinking about. He told me that our interactions that day were a series of negative or uncomfortable missteps. \n\nThat statement fucked me up. I already hate that my experience makes shit weird sometimes, that I can\u2019t control how my body reacts, how things affect me. Usually, we can just sit for a second and relax, and try again-- but he was treating me like a Victim, like I was this fragile thing that he couldn\u2019t outwardly reject, but didn\u2019t want romantically, either.\n\nI told him that I didn\u2019t want to lie there anymore. We were wasting time. We both had things to do, and I didn\u2019t want to lie there hoping he would start treating me like he knew and loved me again, talking, something.. I got up and went to the bathroom. \n\nWhen I came back, he just put his shirt on and moved to leave. Still not saying anything.\n\nI asked him if he had anything at all to say.\n\nHe said he didn\u2019t understand why I was upset.\n\nI recounted the above. I said that I felt hurt and rejected and felt that he was only lying there to be polite; I just wanted us to be normal again, to feel like friends. Not like I wigged out on this guy I barely know and he doesn\u2019t know what to say or do, so he just lies there. \n\nHe responded that maybe we should hang out in separate rooms for awhile. \n\n???? What? How will that help? It\u2019s actually astonishing how much he wanted to get the hell out of there. And that\u2019s because I wrecked the mood with my Response. But normally he doesn\u2019t mind, he waits for cues from me, we talk, we feel better together. This time, he was just a still body in the dark, and I felt cloying, emotional, ridiculous, for trying so hard, for fumbling so much to be comforted or to feel normal.\n\nNow I'm in my room alone, feeling shittier than ever.\n\nWhat do you think, Reddit?

I don\u2019t understand why at the end when he knew it was done, that I was done and there was no going back, why even then could he not tell the truth? Or was it I just couldn\u2019t believe a word he said? I don\u2019t know if he was faithful or not because he won\u2019t admit to any wrong doing ever. When he does something I know for a fact he wouldn\u2019t be okay with me doing and yet he won\u2019t admit to that known truth, is it wrong of me to not believe anything else he says on the subject? What if he is innocent and his narcissism won\u2019t allow him to admit to even the known facts but he is still faithful, am I then the abuser for accusing him of cheating? Can I blame him for me drawing that conclusion? I feel abusive if I do so, even though I do blame him.

I was told I had the bedroom if I needed it. That statement just broke me. Like there was nowhere I could be safe from him. I have stopped attending a religious festival where he just goes to drink because of being told to behave myself when he is the one to instigate with me. \n\nI recently starting trying to get involved in other organizations and communities. I have panic attacks when people try to get me more involved. I have nightmares of the same thing happening over again. I can't believe people when they say they value my presence and effort. I want so badly to be a part of something bigger than me, but when I start getting involved I feel terrified and sick. Can you be abused by a community? How do you get over that??

She doesn\u2019t care about me she cared about what I could provide her. I can now see it clearly. There were times that she got me really mad &amp; upset &amp; not once did I break up with her or revert to being verbally abusive. Why did I not do this? Because I care for another human being. I have compassion &amp; empathy. I didn\u2019t want to see the person I cared &amp; loved so much hurt by my actions. Her on the other hand had absolutely no issue with breaking up with me when she felt like it totalling over 20 times &amp; verbally abusing me, referring to me as fat, ugly, idiot, moron. I believed every apology because It is unfathomable to individuals whose own inherent human coding is to care for other people\u2019s wellbeing that a human being can act in this way. Thus we trust them when they apologise, we believe they are sorry just as we would be if we hurt someone we loved. They lack object constancy, every thing is black or white. They love us or hate us. They struggle with the ability to have any type of compassion towards another human being when they perceive that we have hurt them. \n\nThe hoovering is also a fake sign of caring. The pleading to me to take her back &amp; she had changed was nothing more than another manipulative tactic to pull me back in to secure her reliable supply. The cold &amp; calculated methods  they use are disgusting. I believe my ex learned this behaviour from her own mother who I witnessed using manipulative techniques &amp; triangulation on social media. Before we started dating I was friends with her mother, her mother asked me to post something on her Facebook wall about going for a drink with her to make another guy jealous. This was a massive red flag that I should have taken note of. My ex would send me texts that looked as if they were for someone else just to pull me in &amp; manipulate me, not caring once for my feelings. She was proud at how honest she was however she once faked her own suicide when she didn\u2019t want to speak to me again. She also told a supply that she worked in a bank when she had been unemployed for 6 years. How many more lies had she told me? Her honesty claim was merely an excuse to verbally abuse people. As she used to say \u201cI will tell someone what I think of them because I cant lie\u201d. \n\nThis brings me to the major issue. Why did I not see the pattern of destruction earlier? Why didn\u2019t I have any deal breakers to fall back on? If my friend had of told me that his girlfriend was forever breaking up with him &amp; verbally abusing him I would have had no problem with telling him to run far far away. But not I. I stayed thinking I was the good guy, I thought my love would fix it. I thought everything would be just fine when\u2026\u2026\u2026 I allowed myself to be abused because I had no self-respect or self-worth. To me the sporadic glimpses of love &amp; care was enough for me to stay. I craved the attention, even the negative attention I become addicted to. The trauma bonding was well &amp; truly in play. The intense emotional experiences were holding me emotionally captive. This together with intermittent reinforcement in which her abuse was mixed in with periodic affection. She loved every single thing about me she would say. I was loving, caring, good in bed, intelligent but then I was a \u201cf\\*\\*king d\\*\\*k\u201d who annoyed her &amp; never listened. \n\nThe funny thing is that although I am emotionally scarred &amp; currently going through daily pain &amp; uncomfortable reflection I have actually won. She is no longer Hoovering me because I no longer serve her any purpose. I am just another ex as she used to say. I am just another guy who she will probably say cheated on her. She picked me because I was insecure. I let her swear at me &amp; emotionally abuse me even before we started dating. I trained her that I would come running back after each discard. As she would often remind me that she liked me because I never went any where even when things got tough. She thought I would give her infinite supply but oh boy she was so wrong. My Knight in shining armour, my guiding inner self always told me I had better watch out. My faithful ever present intuition warned me over &amp; over again. I ignored it until I could no longer. My weakness became my strength until I finally said enough is enough. I am now in charge, I am the leader &amp; she has lost this battle. I witnessed many of her male orbiters circling her, kissing her ass &amp; keeping her up on that pedestal. I thought these guys could see &amp; appreciate how wonderful this woman was just as I did. She latched on to them with her vampire fangs planning on sucking every last bit of self-confidence, respect &amp; self-esteem out of them just as she did with me. She often said that she had weird taste in men. She went for the soft ones. Yeah she went for the ones that she could manipulate &amp; abuse. \n\nIt's not going to be easy but I will take each day as it comes &amp; I will survive &amp; repair my shattered self esteem &amp; zero self-worth. The scars will heal slowly &amp; new tougher skin will grow over them. The scars will never disappear &amp; they will be there forever as a constant reminder of how you should never ever let anyone take you for granted no matter how much you care for them. \n\nBe strong &amp; learn to love yourself unconditionally.

I can't! I can't unsee that you actually do hate me, that you have such hostility for me simmering under the surface. I fucked off when you told me to.

We separated 9 months ago and in February I was ready to start dating again. I wasn\u2019t looking for anything super serious just wanted to get out there meet new people and have some fun. My nex found out and immediately lost it. That\u2019s a whole thing in and of itself. \n\nAfter a few dates my friend from high school messaged me out of the blue and said she found someone who was perfect for me. We started talking and went on a few dates. We have an unrealistic amount of things in common. Which is a red flag obviously. Early on it was wild how much alike we are, and I don\u2019t mean we like the same things. We think the same way. Our personalities are so similar. As different as me and my nex were (we agreed on nothing ever) he and I are similar in almost every way. \n\nI was really concerned and almost stopped talking to him when a friend pointed out we don\u2019t know each other and it would be impossible for him to guess that much about me without meeting me first. I actually realized I was agreeing with almost everything he said. He\u2019d tell me something about himself and I\u2019m over here getting excited \u201cwow me too!\u201d I was worried I was going to come across as a liar because I kept agreeing with him. \n\nWe\u2019re both Libras, our birthdays are the same week, we\u2019re both super outgoing. We\u2019re both super charming and flattering of each other. We love watching TV and are both home bodies. We\u2019re both career focused. We\u2019ve both been in abusive relationships. I mean he could have combed my Facebook from my friends account and he could just be picking up information from that but it seemed unlikely. My friend said we were very similar people so having a third party who knew how much alike we were makes it seem less likely to be a lie. \n\nHe says things that seem like exaggerations or just flat our lies. Things like how he is two years away from having a doctorate in psychology. It could be true but I\u2019m not certain and have no way to fact check. Sometimes he says things and I feel like he is trying to impress me. He tries to buy me stuff, always wants to pay for dinner, etc but I\u2019m probably better off financially which makes me feel weird.  \n\nHe is moving really, really fast. He has already made comments about falling in love with me but we\u2019re less than a month in. He isn\u2019t pushy about it though. He hasn\u2019t pressured me or really made me feel pressured in any way. \n\nHe is really open about his shortcomings. He has told me a lot of things my nex hid from me for months. His past drug problems, he lives with family, he doesn\u2019t have a car. I\u2019m sure you\u2019re wondering why I would even consider dating someone who is in a position like that but he said he was in a long term abusive relationship and he just moved back to our state. He lives really close to his work and rides a motor bike to work. He told me he hadn\u2019t really had a reason to buy a car, and was living with family because his grandpa has dementia and helps take care of him. Which seem like reasonable explanations. He is educated, and he has a professional job which makes me feel better because there is obviously some level of responsibility there. \n\nHe has talked about our future, but I brought it up first. He\u2019s Italian and I joked about Jersey Shore being his people. I joked about naming our children after people from the show. I told him getting married was super important to me because I want to change my last name. It\u2019s been kind of an ongoing joke between us now. Unlike my nex he doesn\u2019t just agree with everything I say. He told me he doesn\u2019t really believe in marriage and has mentioned he isn\u2019t super sold on the idea of having children. \n\nTL;DR I feel like there are these red flags but at the same time there are things about him that just don\u2019t fit the bill like being upfront about unflattering facts about his current situation and his past. It feels completely different than my relationship with my nex but I guess I\u2019m worried he could just be a much better manipulator. \n\nI\u2019m afraid I\u2019m just too sensitive and maybe I\u2019m sabotaging this because it\u2019s easier that way.  \n\n", "subreddit": "NarcissisticAbuse"}

She regularly showed favoritism towards me, and left my sister on the sidelines. She often accused her of being demon possessed and mentally ill, which eventually led her to use various forms of corporal punishment. My sister has confessed to me that around this time, in the middle of the night when she had to go to the bathroom, she was too afraid to leave her room because she felt that our mom would punish her for it. She ended up wetting the floor, and my mom was all too quick to blame her for this.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAround the time I turned 13, the 3 of us downsized substantially into a 2 bedroom townhome, and entered one of the most stressful periods of our lives. I started to develop my own fashion tastes and personal beliefs, which often contradicted my mother's. She didn't like this a bit. The fact that she had already grown exceedingly paranoid made the situation much worse, so with time, she began to shut me off from the rest of the world. It got to the point where she ran some of my only friends off of our property whenever they wanted to play with me. Eventually, I was only allowed to hang out with other kids once a week at my drama class. Keep in mind that both me and my sister have been forcibly homeschooled for most of our lives, so we were very isolated.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI started to become extremely depressed and self destructive, and lost motivation to complete my online schoolwork entirely. I fell several months behind, and almost failed the 8th grade. Understandably, my mom was very upset about this, so she forced me into confessing my personal struggles to her. I have lapses in my memory, so it's hard for me to remember exactly how this all played out, but I remember that she had become completely fed up with my change in disposition. This is when her punishments started.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAfter rummaging through my laptop and search history, she found out that I had become an atheist. This was what she used to justify pinning me to my bed by the throat, striking me across the face, throwing objects at me, pulling my hair, and so on. To be completely honest, I actually preferred her physical abuse over her psychological, because the things she said to me on a regular basis almost drove me into taking my own life. At times, I think she even wanted me to attempt suicide so that she could have me baker acted, and paint me to look like the crazy one throughout all of this.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe abuse continued for a very long time after this, until she had completely stripped me of my individuality. I gave up fighting, and decided to conform to her standards of perfection. This included pretending to become a Christian again. Since then, the physical abuse has completely stopped, and now she's showing favoritism towards me again. A while after the incidents that transpired, I resorted to disorderly eating habits as a way of coping with the residual trauma that she left, and ended up losing up to 15 lbs. I've gained 6 of those lbs. back, and although I'm still struggling with hyper vigilance and anxiety, I'm in a much better place than I was in back then.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe main thing that worries me right now is my sister. She's 19, still has a learner's permit, and my mom refuses to teach her how to drive. She won't even let her hold down a part time job. I'm 2 years younger than her, and our mom seems more willing to help me learn how to drive than her, who should've been her main priority. She tells me that she doesn't even feel comfortable bringing my sister to social gatherings, because she thinks she's too antisocial, and basically a lost cause. The only way my sister can get out of this situation is if I get out first, and honestly, that scares the shit out of me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy best friend of 9 years is in a very similar situation, and we've come up with a plan to escape together. Normally, my mom would be horrified at the thought of me moving out, but with my friend added to the equation, she seems more open to it. Since I can't drive and don't have a job, I don't know how I'm going to save up enough money for this. My friend has been making some money by selling fursuits, and says that her mom may let her get a job sometime this year too. My mom isn't exactly thrilled with the thought of me holding down a part time job while in college, so does anyone know how I can effectively make money online?

I saw his car in the parking lot once after that, and then it was radio silence for a year and a half. \n\nI went into work one day last week and I was minding my own business when I looked over and saw his vehicle and it sticks out like a sore thumb because the previous owner made some unique modifications to it (stickers, suspension, rack on top of it). Since I'll be referencing it later, I still drive the same car as well that has scratches on the back that stand out. \n\nSo, once I saw the vehicle, I ran inside my store. I clocked in, hid in the office for a few minutes before finally coming out. It was just my manager and I there and I told him what was up and he said he'd take care of it if the guy came in, but my ex didn't. I was also physically shaking at this point. There were no customers and the store looked decent so I stood at the register in front of large windows and I couldn't stop staring at that vehicle for some stupid reason.  \n\nEventually, the guy came out of the store he was in, walking across the parking lot with a girl that he dated shortly after me (when he started telling lies about me to her, she threatened me multiple times via text message as if I was harassing him rather than it being the other way around) and he got in his vehicle. \n\nEverything was fine, I was glad he was leaving so I could try and calm down and then, when he drove by my store, he looked dead straight at me. To be honest, I don't know if he recognized me as I never wore my hair up around him because he left bruises all over my neck, but it was enough to drive me into a 10 minute panic attack in the office. \n\nI expected to hear from him, but I didn't. \n\nTwo days later, I'm back at work. I'm minding my own business when I see his vehicle again parked *directly across* from my car. I kinda stay in the same parking space, but if he was sitting in his vehicle, he could stare at the back of my car and the noticeable scratches. It's a deadringer to tell him that I'm still in the area. \n\nThe manager I was working with that night made sure I stayed distracted so I didn't see him leave, but it was enough to make my skin crawl and it made me super jumpy and paranoid. \n\nI haven't seen him since, but I haven't worked an evening shift since that day. I work two evening shifts this week and it's making me slightly worried. I don't know if I'm just being stupid and he doesn't realize that I'm still in the city or if he's just doing things to fuck with me, but it really bothers me. \n\nIt's like once I feel like I'm doing better, something happens and if we come face to face again, I don't know how I'm going to react. I've seen that girl I was talking about come in the store so she knows I'm there, but I don't think she told him or at least I hope she didn't. \n\nI don't know how to handle it so some advice would help. I just want to feel safe and secure at my job and not be a mess every time I end up seeing his vehicle there. ", "subreddit": "survivorsofabuse"}

Note: This may be extremely triggering for some, so be careful. &lt;3\n\nThis is my story,\n\nHey guys, \n  I wanted to reach out. I'm in a bit of a situation. Okay, so, it was my Ndad's birthday on the 28th. I haven't spoken to him since the fall. He got drunk and \"jokingly\" threatened to kill me. I called him out and got upset, so then he gaslit me into believing I was overreacting. \n\n  I didn't contact him again until father's Day of last year. He was drunk and said, \"You should be proud of me for actually respecting your boundaries, when you told me not to talk to you,\" He ended up being very rude and dismissive and \"had to go\" either watch a TV show, talk to friends, or sleep. I haven't called him since, because it was very upsetting and this event was very triggering for me, as was the other incident. We texted briefly again in the fall. \n  \n   I told him I was fine and was recently dxed Aspie, which he suggested years ago. That was it and I kind of \"ghosted\" and didn't give him my new phone number/lost interest. I genuinely felt scared of him and therapy encouraged me to go NC for my own health. It was his 64th birthday on the 28th. Mind you, he was sexually abused by his older brother as a kid and ended up doing it to three of his sisters, when he was black out drunk and I believe an older teenager/young adult. \n  \n    I believe he was about four when it happened to him, his brother was ten, the aunt who passed I think was in her teens and the other two were in cribs and diapers. The youngest is like best friends with him now. The older one ended up killing herself a few years ago and when she tried to come forward in the past, no one believed her/dismissed it. She ended up overdosing on alcohol and pills and she was dxed with bipolar, alcoholism, and anorexia, and wasn't taking her meds.\n\n   I'm tearing up writing this. I have a memory of being very little, a baby/todddler, and him molesting me in the basement. He's hovering over me in white sweats and I'm a baby underneath him. We are in the basement of our old house. According to also Nmom, he used to take me down alone as a baby there with him, while he had a smoke. \n\n  I don't know if it's some weird past life thing or if I'm imagining it. I know something happened. Mom ended up leaving him when I was a year and a half old, after he confessed to her about being abused by his older brother and then doing it to three of my sisters. He ended up making a weird comment about my parts at some point at a family Christmas party and comparing them to my mother's. No one else knew what to say and mom said it was really weird.\n\n   He jokingly tried kissing my neck one time when I was a teenager, saying it was \"Italian kisses and I was overreacting when I got upset and how his family did it all of the time. Mind you, we're Irish. I told him my neck was an erogenous zone and to stay away. He laughed at me and mocked how I said \"errongenos\", because I pronounced it wrong,.\n\n  He said I was his \"hot daughter\", said my breasts were larger than my mom's, he wished I was his girlfriend/he had a girl more empathetic like me. We'd give each other back rubs and I'd rub his feet. I felt he was peering in on me, when I was taking a shower. He's stand up against the door constantly and ask if I was, \"Okay in there, since I was taking awhile,\" \n\n   The very last time I visited him, we were at a vegan/gluten-free restaurant. I felt anxious that the waitresses were giving us dirty looks. He joked and said that people probably thought we were dating. A lot of death threats and covert/overt incest over the years have hurt me and my family. Mom also left me alone with him after the divorce, despite knowing that he was a sexual predator, and I would stay over his place in a crib. \n\n   Sometimes we'd give each other a peck on the lips. He would bully me into telling him when I lost my virginity and wanted to know exactly when it happened. He got jealous when I had a crush on my step-dad as a kid and not him, because he wanted to be my \"Prince Charming\". He got jealous when I was in a relationship and he felt like I was replacing him with my boyfriend. He asked me if I had fooled around with my girl best friend yet and told me that if I was bisexual, guys wouldn't like to share me and how when I originally wanted to wait until marriage, guys wouldn't do it and how you, \"had to try the cow, before you purchase the farm,\"\n\n    I have felt deep shame and depression from this and have not shared this with many people. This is a huge family secret and none of them from his side know about it. I strongly believe he's smeared me/bullied the others into no longer speaking to me or telling them, \"she doesn't want to talk to you,\" Everything was always really great or really terrible with him. I felt like I could tell him everything and how I had to hide everything. \n\n  I thought I was special and we had a \"cool relationship\". I thought I was the problem and he was my best friend. He said he made way more of an effort with me and was much kinder and closer to me, than he was with his father. He was either a monster or the kindest man, possible. I've both been saved from wanting to commit suicide by him and also wanting to end my life because of him. \n\n   How does one let this out and heal from the shame? I know I'm already taking a huge step by letting this out now. How does one learn to love themselves and stop attracting people like their Nparents? Has therapy helped you and how did you know when you found the right one? How did you learn to accept your feelings and not beat yourself up and not hide behind addictions as your aunt and father have done?\n  \n   I still struggle with eating, internet/phone, and self-harm at times. I am thankful to say I have quit the alcohol and drugs. How does one know if a memory is real? Is the PTSD a lifelong thing or can one heal from it? How does one remind themselves that they have loved both a monster and a human at the same time?\n\n   You were both the dragon and the prince as a knight-in-shining armor who came to save me. I'm so grateful that I had the courage to speak up and share my story. I will never become like you and I am breaking the cycle. I will no longer stay quiet to protect you or your \"music career\". You don't deserve protection, when you should have been caring for me.\n  \n   I hope I can process these feelings and learn to let go, so I don't let this trauma bond and the past ruin my life anymore. I was feeling very low before I wrote this. I hope this helps someone else and brings some comfort for those who have been through similar. Thank you for letting my speak my word and for allowing me to share my story. &lt;3", "subreddit": "survivorsofabuse"}

For most of our relationship I thought I\u2019ve been helping him work through his mental health to reach a happy healthy life. Now, in retrospect, I have a dark outlook, live in a rural area with no social life and tip-toe around the house in a struggle to keep him content. \n\nRed Flags: \n\nIdealized me in the beginning: \n\n\\- wrote me a note a month into our relationship that explained I was his childhood sweetheart since grade 3, that he\u2019s been in love with me since then. The letter concluded: \u201cmerry Christmas, I love you\u201d \n\n\\- drinks to excess. I cannot keep alcohol in the house. I\u2019m fairly certain he hides it from me and drinks more than I know. \n\n\\- is mean. Seems to be almost totally disconnected to the idea of animals having feelings. (hasn\u2019t hurt anything in front of me but told me a story one time about punching a mean dog in the face)  \n\n\\- has texted women behind my back. He blamed it on the alcohol/ lack of intimacy with me/ won\u2019t do it again\u2026 I suspect he is still doing this, just deleting the messages. \n\n\\- refuses to talk about his past girlfriends. When I question his relationships, he gets uncomfortable, which turns into an argument that ends with \u201cIm the only one that matters\u201d \n\n\\- gets irrationally angry over little things (driving in traffic is the absolute end of the world for him) \n\n\\- that anger eventually became a depression. For about a year he was desperately sad/ sick and constantly abused alcohol. Of course I did everything to make his environment comfortable. (clean house, dinner made every night, keep cans of cider in the fridge\u2026 anything to better his outlook) \n\n\\- Eventually, when I confronted him about not perusing a doctor or solution for his depression, he would throw his sadness back at me: \u201cyou knew I was miserable when we first got together\u201d\n\n\\- lack of sex: when I confront him about how little sex we have, he manipulates it and somehow turns it into me devaluing myself and not confident with my body. How can he be attracted to someone who isn\u2019t attracted to themselves??\n\n\\- When we do have sex, he\u2019s only concerned with his sexual desires, literally doesn\u2019t do anything for my pleasure. Ever. \n\n\\- lack of attendance at events: has bailed last minute to weddings, concerts, work parties, cottages, important school events etc. Usually blames it on not feeling well / social anxiety\n\n\\- guilt tripping/ praying on my empathy when I\u2019m at said events (many of examples of this) most recently: I was dog sitting 50 minutes away for 5 days. The first night he texted me to explain he fell and hit his head. He said he was nauseous, concussed and should go to the hospital. He called in sick to work because he was so ill. For the next five days he complained about his injury via text message. I continually told him he should go to the doctor/ hospital but his excuse was that he missed me and needed me to take him. I finally came home (6 days after his injury) and he still hadn\u2019t gone to the doctor and was complaining about his symptoms \n\n\\- Future Faking: \n\nI am a fulltime student and he is currently working minimal hours. Every moment I see him he\u2019s miserable, / hurt / sick\u2026. but when I confront him about it (\u201cI chose to be in this relationship and its very depressing\u201d) it\u2019s all about how great the future will be, how much we\u2019re meant to be and how it will get better. \n\n\\- when I have threatened to leave, he cries, has threatened to kill himself, somehow manipulates me into hoping and waiting for things to get better \n\n\\- never gives me compliments. The jokes I make are never funny / always inappropriate. If I voice this issue, he will respond \u201cno we always laugh\u201d and give me an explanation that is completely opposite of reality \n\n\\- points out my bad habits (smoking pot) \n\n\\- constantly makes himself a victim (depressed, alcoholic, sick) and blames those events on why he\u2019s so unhappy. When I draw a line in the sand and tell him he needs to get help, He manipulates the conversation into me being responsible for his happiness and all the strides he\u2019s taken to improve\n\n\\- the thing that prompted me to post this though, is our engagement, because I now realize it was very manipulative. It happened moments before we were heading to 3 separate family dinner parties on Xmas eve. I was completely shocked, and felt \u201cobligated\u201d to say yes. Looking back now, as people pleaser I didn\u2019t want him to bail on Xmas dinner. I said yes to avoid a fight. \n\nTaking the steps to move out is so scary. I have family that I can stay with, but I am hesitant to tell them the truth. Why? I used to be so confident in myself. \n\nThank you for reading. ", "subreddit": "NarcissisticAbuse"}

{"post_id": "b8a68l", "created_utc": 1554157185, "title": "Does this count as sexual abuse and is it worth confiding in a parent?", "author": "[deleted]", "self_text": "For some background: F,19. I recently realised that when I was around 7 I was sexually abused by my sister who is 3 years older than me. If I'm thinking correctly, it began by her showing me videos of girls kissing to which I said was disgusting - not because it was two girls but because she'd show me gross tongue kissing videos - and she'd agree. I don't know how it began from there because I only distinctly remember three instances of it happening but I know it happened more. She would have us kiss which I didn't want to do but my sister has always been manipulative, I don't remember how she got me to go along with any of it and I also had no idea what it even was, just that it was something to keep secret. I think it just started small but she progressed it to tongue kissing (only on her end) but I'd say that it felt weird and I didn't want to do it but she still tried. One of the three experiences I distinctly remember was when we were at the swimming pool and my grandad had left to get changed and she convinced him that we would hang around for five minutes more. Anyway, I don't think she knew but my grandad was watching from the balcony area and she tried multiple times to kiss me but the lifeguard was watching and this was something I knew had to be a secret between us both. When we left the pool, my grandad asked what we were doing, why we were kissing in the pool and I said that she just did it out of no where. Another instance, my mum was at work and my grandma was taking care of us, we were upstairs playing dolls and she locked the door and instigated it, having me remove my clothes. This was the first time and only time (I believe, I honestly don't know for certain) that I was naked and she had me sit on top of her whilst she was clothed. I was just chatting normally about my dolls and stuff because I had no idea what was actually even going on but she must have. The final experience I remember was when we were at my dads house but he was off with his girlfriend, we were playing a game and she was trying to kiss me whilst we laid on the bed and I told her I didn't want to do that and that it was weird. I believe that was the last time she ever did anything sexual with me however I'm not so certain. I'm not even sure if I was sexually abused by her, I always thought that she was only 10/11 so maybe she had no idea about sexual stuff like that, when I was at that age I didn't, however I was a really late bloomer and if she was already looking at videos of girls kissing then she must've had sexual feelings. I just knew that I never wanted to do anything she made me but she had convinced me somehow that it was okay and normal even though I knew no one could find out. It's always been something I was ashamed of and felt disgusting about, but I was a child and I had no idea what was happening. I never thought I was sexually abused because she was a child too. Anyway, I don't know whether to tell my mum. Her and my sister aren't close, she no longer lives with us and my relationship with my sister has always been bad but very good with my mum. I only realised what actually happened to me yesterday morning and it's been tearing me up since, I can't concentrate and I'm crying in class. I feel like I really want to tell her, but how do I tell her that my sister may have sexually abused me? I feel like I was some kind of accomplice, or wilful participant but I wasn't. Does this even count as sexual abuse? Should I tell my mum or forget about it? How do I tell her without feeling like it was my fault or without her thinking it was nothing? Was this a normal part of other people's childhood? I know there's a lot of questions and I've never used Reddit before so I might have done this all wrong but I just don't know what else to do, I have no one else I could tell.\n\nTL;DR - my sister \u2018groomed\u2019 me into kissing her when I was 7 and she was 10 even though I didn\u2019t want to or understand it, I always thought she didn\u2019t understand it either so never considered it sexual abuse despite being ashamed of it.

Is does get better.", "author": "Morgaroo8349", "self_text": " \n\nSometimes leaving isn\u2019t too difficult. Sometimes you know the person  is entirely wrong for you. You know that it would never work because you  never achieved that level of intimacy necessary to build a lasting  relationship. You never became best friends.\n\nThen there are times when leaving is the most difficult thing in the   world because you are willfully choosing to lose your best friend. We  lose the people who are most important to us and, let\u2019s be honest, end  up lost for a good moment afterwards ourselves.\n\nWith time, however, we learn to pick up the pieces and redefine our  direction in life. Yet, not all of us completely move on. Some of us  still hold on to that friendship even though it is long gone. Why? We do  love them.\n\nWe wish they could be part of our lives. But at the same time we  understand that is impossible. So what else is there to do than to write  them a letter we\u2019ll never send?\n\n*Hey there, stranger.*\n\nIt\u2019s been a while, hasn\u2019t it? Not just saying \u201chey,\u201d but it\u2019s been a  while since we really saw each other\u2019s hearts. Since we poked at the  dark and dusty corners of each other\u2019s minds that no one else ever saw.  Since we danced and sang to songs that no one else has ever heard of.  It\u2019s been a while since we took the ugly, broken, and dented things  about us and turned them into something that only you and I could truly  belly laugh at \u2013 because that\u2019s what you and I always did best.\n\nI\u2019d like to say that it was your decision alone to keep this  distance, but I think we both know it was for the best. Sometimes growth  means loss, and sometimes loss is okay. It\u2019s a loss that\u2019s quite  honestly not really gone, even though it still kinda stings as if it  were. The one thing that can definitely be said is that when we cut  ties, we leave no strand behind, but slice right through until we no  longer remember how to find each other. \n\nSometimes I wonder if you ever feel this kind of loss too. Sometimes I  wonder if you dance around the painful in-betweens of \u201cI\u2019m fine where I  am\u201d and \u201cBut I still kinda miss it,\u201d just like I do. I still think  about you. Thank you for giving me something to think about. And thank  you for  making that \u201csomething\u201d a tiny collection of memories that,  every now and then, throws a peculiar smile on my face, even when it\u2019s  accompanied by a sad heart. \n\nI understand why not being in each other\u2019s lives is what\u2019s best, at  least for me. You made me feel like my friendship wasn\u2019t valuable. Our  friendship was really one-sided, and I was always the one fighting for  it. There were times I felt like I couldn\u2019t talk to you because you  didn\u2019t care what I had to say. You were always so quick to get angry  with me when I tried to explain how I was feeling. I never spoke to you  with the hatred that was always easy for you to come by. You would shut  me out and push me away, and I was always the one who had to reach out  and apologize. You never listened to understand, only to respond, but a  lot of the time your response was no response at all. \n\nYou treated me like I was replaceable. Like I was an old rag doll you  were done playing with. A toy you would put up on a shelf because you  didn\u2019t want to get rid of it, but you weren\u2019t interested in it for the  time being. You only wanted me around when you had no one else. I was  suddenly worth your time again. The person you went to when you were  upset because you felt like you didn\u2019t have anyone else. The person you  hung out with only out of convenience or boredom. It was difficult  because I didn\u2019t understand why you only wanted to be my friend some of  the time. You made me think your friendship was only a part-time job.\n\nI tried really hard to earn your time and attention. I tried to plan  fun things that I thought you would enjoy so you would be excited to  hang out with me. I\u2019d look up restaurants I thought you would like and  concerts I knew you would want to go to. I liked giving you gifts  because hearing your reaction and seeing the expression on your face  from how happy you were made me really happy in return. None of that was  enough. \n\nI let you make me feel like my friendship wasn\u2019t valuable. That it  wasn\u2019t important enough to put much thought or time into. I let you  believe that I\u2019d always be there no matter how you treated me because I  always had been. I would always reach back out to you. I would always  apologize. I would always belittle myself and compromise my feelings if  it meant you would be happier. I let you treat me that way because I  thought you were my best friend. At the time I didn\u2019t feel like I  deserved any better. I never understood why you always felt like people  left you and only liked the idea of you, but I understand now.\n\nI liked the idea of you being my best friend. I liked the idea of you  being the person I believed you were capable of being. I liked the idea  of you realizing I was a person worth your time. I stood by you through  everything. I was the only person who put up with the way you handle  friendship. Have you never stepped back to look at the revolving door of  people in your life? I don\u2019t believe that you will change, and I don\u2019t  think you can. If you don\u2019t see a problem with the way you treat people,  how can you? I\u2019ve come to realize that it\u2019s not worth it anymore. I  stopped wanting to fight for your friendship. I didn\u2019t want your time if  it wasn\u2019t freely given. I didn\u2019t want to feel like a chore anymore. I  stuck it out as long as I could. \n\nAs we both know, I have absolutely no idea how you are, but I wish  you all the best, and although you will never read this, although we  will never speak to each other again, and although you are out of my  life forever, I wish you nothing short of happiness. I wish you the best  in life. I hope you surround yourself with people who lift you up and  inspire you to be your best. I hope you make the right choices and don\u2019t  do things you\u2019ll regret. I hope you are happy now because even though  you didn\u2019t value my friendship, I valued yours. We aren\u2019t friends  anymore, but we used to be. And even if it didn\u2019t mean something to you,  it meant something to me.\n\nI don\u2019t regret you. I don\u2019t regret knowing you or having you as a  friend. You\u2019ve been unkind and you\u2019ve been hurtful, but everything  you\u2019ve said or done, I wouldn\u2019t take any of it away. I wouldn\u2019t change a  thing. I am who I am now because when you left, time and time again, it  pushed me to love myself more than I ever have. It showed me how worthy  I am of other people\u2019s time and attention. You were cruel, and I  couldn\u2019t wrap my head around it because the way you treated me, I could  never imagine doing that to someone, let alone you. You punished me  every time I had an opinion or feeling that didn\u2019t match your own. I was  someone who loved and supported you and stuck by your side since the  beginning, but I still got kicked to the curb. That was your doing.\n\nI know you hurt. I know you have insecurities. I know you don\u2019t fully  love yourself. And I know when you hurt, you project it onto others.  And a lot of the time I was the punching bag. Your silent treatments,  your hurtful words, and your rage, I took it. But even so, I was also  there when nobody else was present, and as soon as you became fixated on  someone, you acted like you didn\u2019t need me anymore. I was only worth  something to you when you were lonely. And you can\u2019t comprehend how that  made me feel because you aren\u2019t capable of hurting for me, only for  yourself. And that\u2019s why you lack empathy. \n\nYou should know, if you\u2019re surrounded by people now, that doesn\u2019t  mean you still aren\u2019t alone. The only difference is, I\u2019m not there  anymore for you to lean on and drain energy from. I hope the people you  choose to be around now make you satisfied, although I don\u2019t believe you  ever will be. I hope you gain a sense of confidence one day to not be  so defensive by shutting down in order to avoid having to hold yourself  accountable for hurting someone else\u2019s feelings. You don\u2019t like being  told that your behavior upsets another person. And in order to maintain  long-term friendships, a person needs to understand that there will be  conflicts that require communication and effort. This is for every close  friend. Period. And people that cannot handle this, as a result, will  have extremely shallow, short-lived friendships because they don\u2019t want  to do the emotional work.\n\nReason, respect, empathy, and mutual understanding should be what  dictates a relationship, not abandonment.  Through it all, even though  you\u2019ll never be able to understand or feel how fiercely I loved you, I  just want you to know I did. I never took a single part of you for  granted. I always loved you for you, and I found new reasons to love you  every day.\n\nI hope you learn how to love better. I know I was just a small  chapter in your story, but I hope it was one of your favorites, and I  hope it\u2019s one you can look back on and read with a smile. \n\n*Never again,* \n\n*Your Lost Best Friend*", "subreddit": "NarcissisticAbuse"}

Abusers don't let their victims have their own things, right? \n\n\u00a0\u00a0 Once I started considering that what I was going through was emotional abuse, I used to scold myself. I was overreacting. Besides, my parent had a very rough childhood, and had gone through horrible things in their life. So who was I to compare my hiccups to their situation?\n\u00a0\u00a0 \n\u00a0\u00a0 I made a longer post about this on another sub, but basically heres the climax that made me realize what could be going on. I am homeschooled, and have been for many years. In 2017, I had to switch homeschool programs which resulted in me starting my first year of highschool in November. I was expected to complete both semesters by June. 10 months of work in just 6 months. Obviously I failed meeting that deadline, and due to a mix of things didn't end up completing 9th grade until December of last year. I was put in a shitty situation that set me up for failure, and then was blamed for it and put down for it constantly.\n\n\u00a0 I was told that I had ruined THEIR summer, and how THEY had been stuck at home all summer, even though they were an adult. There was no empathy for how hopeless and alone I felt. I felt like giving up, like ending it because I was so stressed. For the last year before that I had been mentally okay, but after the year of schooling hell my anxiety issues and depression had resurfaced. \n\n\u00a0 It didn't matter how I felt. I started thinking back to how I had been treated whenever something came up. Yelled at for hours about the smallest, meaningless things. Reduced to hyperventilating and tears for something that could of been corrected with a simple demand. Things that have already passed being brought up. Family members being shit talked, only to pair me with them whenever they were upset. \n\u00a0\n\u00a0 It could be anything. A dish, the couch, my apperance. It didn't matter. It wouldn't be mentioned for weeks, then suddenly she would have a problem with it. She would yell and yell, mentioning everything she could think of to keep the arguement going. I would stay quiet and as respectful as possible, even if they were in the wrong (for example, yelling at me for a dish that they had used, telling me I didnt clean it right even though they were the one who cleaned it.) Because I didn't want to cause trouble. Besides, she had anger issues. She didn't mean it. \n\n\u00a0 Lately, at the end of these fights, when I'm at my emotional worst, shes been pressuring me into talking about how I feel. Saying things like, 'The only way I can make you feel better is for me to know how you feel'. I don't trust her with knowing how I feel, because its always used against me. \n\n\u00a0For example, recently I got my hair cut really short. We stopped at the store on our way back home. I told her I was going into the bathroom to look at the haircut more in detail and fix it up. After I was done, and felt confident with how I looked (which is rare for me.), I exited the bathroom and joined her in line. She immediantly started messing with my hair and tucking it behind my ear (which I hate, and I've told her how much I hate how it looks and how I think it makes me look ugly, but she always ignores it and says that she knows what looks nice.) I flashed her an uncomfortable look. She didn't take this well, and got very angry with me, practically dragging me out of the store once everything was paid for. \n\nI quickly apoliogized and said \"I'm so sorry, I didn't mean for it to come across that way, I'll try to be more aware of that in the future.\" But she wasnt having any of that. \n\nShe hammered me about how disrespectful I was, and how she wishes she could of had her mother do things like that when she was younger, and how I'm going to miss her when shes gone. I ended up having a bad panic attack in the car. We stopped at a gas station. And instead of just going in and getting what she needed so that we could get home, she decided to start asking me on why I looked so annoyed about the hair thing. We were parked in the front of the gas station, being able to see in the glass windows of the shop. People were walking past, standing outside, and she made me sit there for almost what felt like 30 minutes, just digging into me trying to make me confess how I was feeling. Every time I would give her an answer, she wouldn't accept it and kept asking questions. All I could do is sit there and wait for it to be over, picking at my scabs and biting my lip to try and ground myself from breaking down completely.  \n\nWhen we finally got home I felt so tired. So emotionally drained. I wanted nothing more then to go in my room, sleep, and never wake up. I ended up feeling terrible about my haircut and it took me a while to build back my confidence. \n\n My friend is a similar (all be it worse) situation. We plan on moving out asap and rooming together during college. So that we can have a chance at freedom. (I brought this up and she has since then tried to derail the situation, saying the only way I'll make it is if I live with them through college or join the military, and that I'm just setting myself up for failure.) \n\n But still, I question if this is abuse. I'm allowed to do the things I want. I have a bank account. I make costumes and I'm allowed to sell them. I'm currently learning how to drive. I get an allowance every month. There are times that I legitimately have a good time with her. But I feel like I have to walk on eggshells. Like one wrong move and I get flipped upside down. It leaves me feeling empty and worthless. I dread getting up in the morning, having to deal with what could happen. But I also feel bad for feeling like I'm being abused. I don't know how to feel anymore. \n\n \n\u00a0 ", "subreddit": "abuse"}

For the better part of the month he has ignored me. I, of course don't bother trying to reach out to him during these times because I refuse to beg for forgiveness and will not put myself in that position when I know in my heart that I have done nothing wrong.\n\nThe problem is that he really thinks I did. Out of nowhere one day in the very beginning of the month he decided to text message me starting a fight. Claiming that I neglect him and I am not giving him what he needs. Which, is probably true in the sense of his narcissism. I truly do not let him waste my energy and I don't fight with him. So I guess in that way, I'm not fueling him the way he needs. And he supports this by making up lies. Which I don't even feed into because I know he knows its a lie. So he cuts me out and stops talking to me. And I let it ride out of course. \n\nExcept his birthday was during this time, in which I wished him a happy birthday. And that was that. He didn't answer me for days later and then tried to pick up conversation again like he never ignored me. I have a low tolerance for bullshit, black and white reality or not, so I immediately said I am not going to pretend like I wasn't reached out to for 11 days straight. But he's incapable of apologizing. So then he starts to basically gaslight me and accusing me of cheating on him. We are long diatnce. I also have to mention that for a brief period of time before I realized what narcissistic abuse was he left me for 7 months during which he started seeing someone else. So I did too. Which ended up being a horrible choice because the guy I was seeing had raped me. And I dealt with it accordingly. But when my my Narc came back like nothing happened, I greeted him with open arms like nothing ever happened because I was so broken down and elated that I was good enough to want back (warped, I know). Eventually he found out I was raped by going through my reddit account on my phone while I was asleep. He knows all of the details and knows it happened while he was seeing someone else, but now I am forever a cheater.\n\nWe are also long distance now seeing as I had to move so I could support myself and to strengthen and repair my relationship with my family, which was not doing so well when I was with him. Anyway, I'm a cheater now.\n\nSo I didn't give in to that either and he started ignoring me again for the rest of the month. During which, a death had occurred. Someone from our hometown. A person we both knew. Though, not in the most recent years. He threw a big party this weekend at his families vacation house and flaunted it all online. And whenever he ignores me and pushes me out he always parties hard and let's me see it. I used to get mad and say something but now I don't because I know he's doing it to get to me. Since I said nothing he decided to use our friends death to open a means of communication again.\n\nI know he didn't go to the wake or the funeral ceremony because my friend was there and I was talking to her about it since I live so far away now. But I do know his parents were there. So after another half month of ignoring me he reaches out asking if I knew our friend. He knows I knew him. He knows because we used to hang out together in high school. He knows because I brought up our friends troubles to him 2 years ago when our friend tried to commit suicide. And he didn't seem to care then. But now that he is passed all of a sudden this kid is \"his friend\" and he doesn't know if I know him or not? This is beyond mind games at this point. That and he lied and said he picked up a mass card for me and wants to know if I knew him so he can give it to me. But he knows that I know him and he didn't even go to the ceremony and instead was parting away all weekend at his parents Vaca house far from where the ceremony was. Does he really think I am that stupid?\n\nI am so beyond everything at this point. Now I am just so sad that someone is capable of doing such horrible things. I wish I could say I know better. I wish I could go no contact. I wish he wasn't like this. I wish I had a significant other that actually cared about me. I know it's basically over. All of these little games, I just can't have them. I can't be wrong all the time. He wants to talk about marriage when he's done with school in two months and he can't even commit to not ignoring me. How is this even possible. How am I supposed to get engaged to someone who does these things to me. And why can't I just let go for good.\n\nIf you've read this far, thanks for sticking through.

I felt sorry for him for being in the middle between his sister and me and I just realized that he wasn't. \n\nWe were together for about three months, when he ordered me two shirts. I didn't ask, I think it was just love bombing. A week later he called me that the shirts arrived and unfortunately they aren't my size,  they barely fit his mother (she is 20 cm shorter and 15 kg lighter than me), but no problem, his mother will buy them and he will order me new ones. I was okay with that, but I asked him to bring the shirts with him when he visits me, I just wanted to give it a try to be sure and I was curious what they look like.\n\nThe shirts were exactly my size, so they were clearly big (really big) for his mother. One of the shirts even missed the price tag by then. I was confused and did not know how could this be possible, then it came to my mind that his sister is the same size as me and I just asked him straight why he lied to me about the shirts.\n\nThe answer was:\n\nHe didn't lie, shirts barely fit his mother. When I told him it's not possible, he said that than he just don't know. I was really upset and sad and felt betrayed. His mother and sister had full closets of clothes and they just needed my f.ckin shirts. I told him that it really upsets me and he became furious, because how could I think his family wants my shirts, what do I think about them, how dare I. That was our first big fight, he shouted at me, said I am paranoid and disgusting, because I think that of his family.\n\nLater that night his sister wrote to me and said sorry for going to the mall in my shirt, she admitted she cut the price tag. His sister has the same size as me, so the thing about his mother and the size of the shirts was obviously a lie. And I felt bad for making an argument. I felt bad and I apologised to him for my behaviour. I never wore those shirts in front of my in-laws, because I was ashamed of the argument \"I DID\". AND I FELT SORRY FOR HIM BEING IN THE MIDDLE, BETWEEN HIS SISTER AND MOTHER AND ME.\n\nYesterday it just hit me, that he knew. Obviously those three agreed that he give them the shirts and he will order me other ones. It was so obvious and I am mad at myself either for not realizing it. I assume back then I was so confused and he just denied everything I didn't come to the right conclusion. I just wish so hard I would dump him back then.\n\nI am not mad about those damn shirts, I am furious, because he made me feel ashamed. After that issue we were together for years and he never even apologized for the things he said to me about my mental health, for shouting with me, etc. If I brought up the topic, he immediately shut me off and if I didn't shut up, it always ended as a big fight. Never validated my feelings about this, and never told me he knew about their intentions. At the and I was always the jerk for trying standing up for myself.\n\nI feel I am crazy, because I am angry about this after years.\n\nI moved out three months ago and now we have nc for about three weeks, and I won't write to him, but I just feel the urge to write him what a monster he is.

He lead me on for four years, but I loved him for fourteen. I'd been surrounded by narcs growing up so a relatively attractive man with all the same tendencies felt right. And on top of that also bipolar just like my dad. He was home personified.\n\nI'd gotten married during that fourteen years, to another narc, but I never stopped thinking about him. After leaving my next we started hanging out again. That lasted a few weeks but eventually I was seeing him off on the way to college out of town. We barely spoke in those four years. It didn't feel wrong, even though I knew that people that love you make time for you. But being ignored feels like freedom to me. \n\nIt all ended when he'd said we'd get together during a holiday visit. Day of I suggest meeting up but he says he's going to spend the entire time with his family after having lost his mom, despite that being almost three years ago. Meanwhile, I'd just lost two of my immediate family members a couple of weeks before, which he was aware of. He goes on to say it's actually because his *boyfriend* wasn't happy with it. \n\nKnowing what I know now about narcissists I can better understand what happened. He wanted me available to be his booty call whenever he was in town. He knew that I wouldn't be available if I was in a relationship so he never offered any kind of closure. He'd wait for me to question his motives, lovebomb/guilt/intimate me into silence then forget all about me while he did whatever he wanted. \n\nRight after hearing about the boyfriend I told him what I'd wanted to say for so long.

That means he's going to want to lay it on thick to better Hoover me and then leave.\n\nPlus, I get a real sense of satisfaction knowing that being discarded must be making him crazy and there's nothing he can do about it.

{"post_id": "b8gt6x", "created_utc": 1554196389, "title": "Is my friend narcissistic, and should I be seeking help?", "author": "shinychromebottle", "self_text": "I don't want to label her or anything, but I feel like I'm only now seeing her for the first time (despite having misgivings about her behaviour for over half a year). We live together with one other person who is a mutual friend, but we used to live with other people and there was some drama directly related to her that made other people leave the house. At the time I thought those people was unreasonable and crazy (there were tears and shouting), but now I find myself wondering if I was misled in how I saw the situation. While the drama was happening she would message me asking for my input and request that I say or do things to \"help\" the situation. I did these things as I trusted that she was in a rough spot and just needed some support. We became close friends extremely quickly, and texted each other every day to the point that she was my first 'point of contact' if I ever needed to vent or talk about something.\n\nIt became clear to me after a few months that she has a controlling personality as far as being a housemate goes. She likes the house to be a certain way and will get irritated if you do things differently. This hasn't always bothered me because some of our preferences align, so I didn't get worked up about it until recently when I realised just how many concessions I've had to make in order to not get \"in trouble\" with her. In general I have noticed that she can be quite rude, demanding and abrasive... but no one else who we lived with ever called her out for it even though I've seen at least one housemate make a bewildered bug-eyed face when she said something rude to another housemate.  She can be extremely fun and charming sometimes, and describes herself as  compassionate and forgiving. She has a popular social media profile where her image is that of a beautiful, sensitive girl who writes about the struggle of living, literature, poetry, philosophy and art. And yet she ranted at and yelled \"fuck you\" at me and our mutual friend because I (immaturely, I admit) dissed Avengers: Endgame after she finished watching it (to be honest though, the only reason I did it was because I was annoyed that she declared that Star Wars was shit... after I told her I loved it. But yes, it was petty of me.) She is quick to raise her voice to loud, angry tones and I've had to ask her to please not get so heated when disagreeing as I find it intimidating and I struggle to articulate when under stress.\n\nWe also have had a pattern of fights for a while now in which I find myself suddenly exposed to her anger and judgement without understanding that I did something wrong, and find myself apologising in confusion and shame. The most recent fights involved showers. In the first fight she mistakenly believed that I took two showers a day due to a previous message I sent her, and she told me she didn't think that was sustainable in a share house. I clarified saying I didn't take two showers every day, but also that hygiene was quite personal and I didn't think it was necessarily bad to do so if the situation called for it (tbh almost EVERYONE I know showers twice a day)... She then said she felt \"triggered\" and that I needed to reassess how I was approaching the situation. She then sent me a long message in which she said that there's \"naturally there's little to do when you get defensive\", but that \n&gt;\"to be asked to not shower twice a day in a sharehouse is a reasonable request. What's not reasonable is how self-righteous you are about it and how you're trying to infer your hygiene is being policed. Please don't manipulate the conversation this way ever again, I don't take lightly to manipulation whether it's conscious or not.\"\n\nThose were her exact words. That message cut me to my core, and I cried for an hour when I read it. It went from 0-100 in the space of just 6 messages. In previous fights with her she has been similarly harsh in her assessment of me, and I always came away from them feeling apologetic and guilty that I'd \"fucked up\" even though I didn't mean to, or it didn't make sense to me how the conversation escalated to that point. Every time we fight she calls me \"defensive\". One time, after a fight, she told me she found my defensiveness upsetting and that she needed to \"take space\" from me for what ended up being 4 days in which she didn't acknowledge or talk to me. I felt so terrible the whole time, but tried to be understanding of her need for space. And as a result of these messages about showering, I began to be extra careful and about when and how often I showered, fearing that we might have another argument if she noticed me showering twice a day. \n\nThe second fight about showers was after I got home from work at 10.30pm, and took a shower before bed around 11.30. Everyone in the house was awake at the time (she and our other housemate were watching a movie) so I thought I wouldn't be disturbing anyone to take a shower so late. The next morning I saw she had sent me a text message while I was showering saying, \"Hey shinychromebottle, quick question: why? You've been home for an hour and had plenty of time to get ready for bed, why now?\" This message made me uncomfortable, as if I needed to answer to her for having a shower even though to my knowledge no one had been bothered or harmed by it... and after showing it to friends, they agreed that it was weird and unnecessary. Like I was a child who needed permission or something. They said I should just be honest and tell her how it made me feel. \n\nI did so hoping we'd be able to have a lil conversation about boundaries, and just to ask her to please not send messages like that because it made me uncomfortable especially after our last fight about showers. That didn't happen. The conversation turned into an hour of her expressing shock and disbelief that I could \"give myself permission\" to bring this up with her when she was the one had been wronged, because my taking a shower at that time showed disregard for her need for sleep on school nights. That I should have known that she waits for me to come home from work before she goes to sleep because I make too much noise when I get home, and that my taking a shower after being home for an hour was extremely thoughtless and rude.\n\nThat yes, she sent the message in anger and to get a reaction out of me, because she thought I deserved it after being so careless towards her. That I was being petty to bring it up and was clearly looking for a fight. That I was being obsessive about the details of the message and ignoring the bigger picture, which was that sometimes we have to just put up with annoying things housemates do and not make a big deal out of it like I was doing. That I overreacted and if my day was clouded by the message, then I clearly had issues. That I was repressed and projecting my problems onto her in a way that was unfair. That my obsession with these events was pathological. That I started the conversation in a hostile way and deliberately ignored how she was physically recoiling from me. It went on and on and I still feel utterly bewildered by how what was meant to be a small productive chat about an uncomfortable message became a psychoanalysis of my character and flaws. At one point after I told her that our previous fights deeply upset me and I was struggling emotionally to deal with them, and that this message stirred up those feelings, she said, word-for-word, \"I will not allow you to entertain this fantasy that we are in an abusive relationship.\" I was and am stunned by such a statement. It's what has made me consider posting here. The whole thing was... utterly exhausting.\n\nI don't feel like I can trust her at all anymore. But I also am afraid that maybe everything she said about me is true. I'm going to start therapy soon because if I am this obsessive, repressed, pathological person, it's worth working on those things... but I can't help thinking that in every fight I've had with her I've been horribly manipulated by her.

I'm just getting out of a ten year relationship with someone who exhibited extremely narcissistic and emotionally abusive behavior, but he always blamed his neglect and carelessness on his anxiety, which is part of the reason I tiptoed so much for so long. I feel like i've been conned reading some of these stories cos they sound so similar to my ex, but then on the other hand I feel like i'm almost discounting his mental illness that I know he did have because he was medicated for it.\n\nI was always well aware that things weren't the \"best\" between us, but being so young (we dated from 17-27, he was diagnosed with anxiety around 19), I feel like I allowed him and outside influences to condition me into accepting his behavior as the \"norm\" for someone with anxiety so a majority of the time I backed down to avoid getting him worked up. We were best friends and I was entirely too co-dependent on him which led to the whole anxious-avoidant attachment trap continuing for so long. Even if I bit, he always knew that he could just throw his anxiety in the mix to have that upper hand on me. He was ultimately the one who left me about a month ago when he decided that I no longer made him happy anymore. Alcohol was also a huge issue in our relationship as he used that to self-medicate from about 18-25 (which inevitably made his anxiety worse as it was inhibiting the effectiveness of his medication) and maybe about two months before the breakup he decided he wanted to start having \"a couple everyday after work\" again after having a good hold on things and not binge drinking/using it to cope for the past couple years. Once I started pushing back and not just letting him slide into a pattern like I used to, he started detaching himself in a way he never had before. I could sense it, but I never thought it would come to this. I get that it's not a great feeling to have someone holding your past over your head, but can you blame me? It really makes me wonder if he did this because I finally remained adamant on something.\n\n\nEdit: Grammar/spelling", "subreddit": "NarcissisticAbuse"}

Ignoring me for hours while eventually I realized she just left her phone. When she was done \u201cdrinking\u201d (I quote that because honestly I don\u2019t know what she was doing) - she finally answered her phone telling me that she isn\u2019t lying because she is telling me now that she went drinking.  Not understanding that hiding her phone so she can deliberately ignore me while she went drinking was the actual issue for me. \n\nHer stories were littered with inconsistencies\n\nPointing out those inconsistencies would get me labeled as an \u201cinterrogator\u201d\n\nWould go into a rage anytime I asked her a question that I knew she was lying about, she\u2019d turn it around on me saying \u201cyou always ask a million questions\u201d - when I\u2019d ask only one that she was uncomfortable with, like \u201chave you been here long?\u201d When she ghosted me for hours then turned up in a parking lot. I knew she was somewhere else before. \n\nFor someone who has something to hide, everything feels like an interrogation. \n\nHad the attitude that she doesn\u2019t have to tell anything to anyone if she didn\u2019t feel like it\n\nExcused her blatant lies with - I don\u2019t have to tell you everything. \n\nHighly manipulative, in essence - did whatever she wanted, whenever she wanted regardless of the consequences (get drunk, drive drunk and ghost me for hours so I don\u2019t know where she is)\n\nShe is avoidant\n \nBest way I can describe it as emotion phobia. She would avoid discussing anything deeper than \u201chow was your day\u201d. If she had issues she wouldn\u2019t bring them forward, she would act out on her own behind my back.  \n\nWas extremely difficult to make a genuine connection with. She was either slightly interested in a conversation or not interested at all and she fluctuated in the middle of a conversation. Best way I can describe it is that she would never see a conversation through the whole way, she wanted to drive the conversation and would usually interject with her own story or a different story all together or just start looking at her phone. Not sure if anyone can relate to this, but she constantly made me feel trivial and unimportant - usually this would happen when I would tell her something and she\u2019d just show me a meme she thought was funny on Instagram. Then I would feign a fake laugh and bury deep the feeling that I just got ignored or the feeling of not being able to connect unless we\u2019re sending memes to each other. \n\nShe spent lots of time on her phone but still ghosted me. This resulted in me feeling rejected because I would see she is active on Instagram but hasn\u2019t responded to me in 6 hours. \n\nSometimes she would respond to a yes/no question with a deflection that took longer to type out than a simple \u201cyes\u201d or a \u201cno\u201d. \n\nIn general, she had a very incredible ability to always have plausible deniability. She would answer questions with what could be considered truth, but misdirection or not the entire truth - but you couldn\u2019t dig deeper because then I would be labeled an interrogator. \n\nSomeone on this sub described this as \u201ctrickle truth\u201d and for me it was more like, she\u2019d give me a vague enough answer that was both true but not the entire story at all and if I wanted more specifics then a fight would ensue (this is also how I started to pick up on her \u201ctell\u201d when she was lying, instant rage after a question) \n\nEffects she had on me: \n\nShe clearly scrambled my brain. I realize that I didn\u2019t go into this relationship completely mentally healthy myself but nobody does. She took the insecure thoughts in my brain and turned the volume up to 11 and kept it there. She triggered all of my insecurities and I projected the internal chaos in my brain outward. In the form of neediness, desperation, clinginess. I allowed her to gaslight me and strip away my ability to trust my intuition, I trusted her word more than my eyes. \n\nI constantly felt stressed. Will today be the day she ghosts me and I wonder what she\u2019s up to and she isn\u2019t responding for hours? Will today be the day I see her giving her coworker a ride again? Will today be the day where I ask a simple question and get yelled at and kicked out? \n\nI feel like the only way to keep the peace was to not say anything. Not being anything up. I am not allowed to have thoughts, and if I am allowed - I am not allowed to bring them up at least not around her or to her. \n\nI would miss her while being right next to her. I ended up feeling like a dog on a leash, if only I cook more dinners maybe then she\u2019ll see that I really care about her. \n\nI turned jealous - I felt like I had to compete with other guys for her attention. \n\n\nWhat I learned: \n \nStand up for yourself and trust your intuition. \nDon\u2019t let people the ability to scramble your brain. \n\nIf you feel like you have to compete for attention, walk away. \n\nIf you feel like a detective, walk away. \n\nIf you feel like you can\u2019t trust them when you\u2019re not around, walk away. \n\nIf you feel deliberately neglected, walk away. \n\nIf your hobbies don\u2019t feel as exciting to you because you\u2019re always stressed about your relationship, walk away. \n\nIf you\u2019re being told you\u2019re just insecure, walk away \n\nSorry for the scrambled, stream of consciousness post.

Would  start to play a song for me on the radio in his truck, and would quickly change the song claiming that it was, \"too loud/much\" for me when that was never the case.\n4. Promised dates that he never took me on.\n5. When I didn't get a job for him at my father's business he punished me by fabricating a story about how his mother didn't like that I didn't help with the dishes when I was invited over for dinner. Never mind the fact that I was A GUEST. When I called him out  for this passive aggressive lie he brought my \"overreaction\" about the situation into every argument we ever had thereafter.\n6. Asked me what I wanted for dinner once, and when I told him he used malicious sarcasm to tell me, \"you'll eat whatever I fucking make.\"\n7. One night, late, my stomach was upset so I was on the toilet for maybe 5 minutes. He rudely asked me multiple times if I was coming to bed when I wasn't even finished with my business.\n8. Would mimic me during fights. Say the exact same things back to me when he decided it was time for him to start one.\n9. Stalked my social media.

We watched Mrs. Doubtfire one night, and I let it slip that I didn't ever want to have kids. He punished me by concocting a lie for the me next day about how his grandmother died from ALS. He said he needed \"time to heal\" so we needed to \"take a break\". His grandmother is still alive and well. I'm not even sure if she actually has ALS. \n11. Met some of my coworkers ONCE, and promptly decided to add them on Facebook.\n12. Admitted to me that he had lied about the death of his grandmother, because when I told him I didn't want kids he said it hurt him too much, and he wanted payback. I stupidly forgave him, but his lies never stopped. They just never quite got that big again. How could they if he wanted to continue to hoover me?\n13. Asked me to move in and pay for groceries. This was between a breakup and before I really knew that his grandmother was actually still alive, and he liked to create a strong definitive line between \"dating\" and \"asking someone to be your girlfriend\". He hadn't asked me to be his girlfriend again at this point. He was probably testing the waters to see how far he could manipulate and take financial advantage of me. I'm thankful every day that I didn't move in.\n14. Was shady about his time in the army, and why he wasn't pursuing a career as a vet tech when he had real experience in the field. He probably gaslighted and manipulated his superiors at those jobs, so he wouldn't ever get a good recommendation from them if he applied elsewhere.\n15. Would swipe on Tinder while sitting next to me on the couch like I wouldn't notice. When confronted about it his first excuse was that I wasn't \"acting right\" and he thought I would break up with him. Then he changed his mind to a better lie, and said he was \"just looking for friends\". Never mind that he was only swiping through other females. \n16. Would put my face in his hands on occasion, look me in the eyes, and say, \"I haven't been a good man to you.\" He was never a man. He's a child. He knows exactly how he treated me. I know too. No matter how many times these days he wants to lie and say that he was \"good\" to me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;", "subreddit": "NarcissisticAbuse"}

But again I think back at this just being a way of gaining my trust.\n\nIn January we went away together and things started to get worse, we'd be in her apartment and she'd be off with me for no or very little reason. She'd make jokes at the way I look, and my stammer which I'm fine with as long as she could take the banter I would give back to her. As it turns out, she couldn't and she ended up not talking to me for hours. She told me one day that we should \"just be friends\" but later on in the evening made a U turn and started kissing me and wanted us to stay together so I was so confused. \n\nThe last straw was again when she was pushing me with the jokes about my looks etc, I told her to \"f\\*ck off\" only in a banterous way, and again she stopped speaking to me and went in a strop, at which point I kicked off and said some pretty hurtful things, but what I thought was deserved at the time. I did since apologise as some of those things I said were taking it too far, but she never apologised for anything she said about me.

She doesn\u2019t deserve to see her mom live in misery through all of his bullshit.\n\nI wish he would disappear off the face of this earth. He is hopeless. He refuses to change.

It's early in the morning and as much as i want to sleep in, i also want to be there for my mom. \nUnfortunately, my car has no ins and reg is expired atm. \nSo, since my gf stays with me every weekend, and suppprts me in a lot of ways by driving me to pick up my son and what not, i just told my mom that i would ask my gf and get back to her. \nSo now when it comes time to ask my gf.. All she can think about is how early it is at, (mind you, nothing is certain, this is only IF my sister cant take her) and how we'd have to take her car. \nThis was enough for her to deem me \"disrepectful\" for \"setting her up\" to be the bad guy..\nSo, given some thought, (You'd rather sleep than help your bf's recently injured and depressed mother? &gt;Not very supportive if you ask me&gt;hadn't really considered anything other than her own feelings&gt; \"uh yeah, that does make you a bad person!) \nSo THAT triggered the discard phase.. She said things that devalued me in the relationship as a whole, \nShe said that I have something to lose and she doesn't (meaning she could leave the relationship and not feel anything) she needs nothing from me and that i am not a good bf to her.. \n(In these moments when i wont stand for the Narcissism) \nCrying and bieng drama, all over \n\"Hey my mom might need me (us) to be there for her for once, MIGHT, if you could just think about it and lemme know how you feel, no rush. Like it's only fucking teusday you can let me know On friday even if you're not down to help, no big deal, im just trying to help everyone .)  \nLike, all i needed was \"okay ill think about it but im probably not going to want to help. But no. She HAD to think of a way to make ME the bad person... Leaving me to mindlessly say yet again \"okay ill work on it\" because its the only thing she believes....\n\nI dont mean to word wall you guys,  i am just shaking and spinning by myself because she went home after all of that.. Discarded me and left to somewhere. \nI just dont know what to say and ive already said too much. \nThanks guys. \n", "subreddit": "NarcissisticAbuse"}

So here's something less depressing. I looked through my husband's text messages with me from the past year and it was so different from how I experienced it before. It's like he always has this airy way of talking. I notice it sometimes when we talk, but in texts it's very evident. Like everything has to be entertaining or else it's not important. Every serious request I make is a joke to him. It's never directly addressed: \"really? why does it matter? Can't you just \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_?\" Just some variation of \"do things my way, and quit complaining!\" followed by, my angry rants that he isn't listening, and then \"okay okay, just stop going crazy.\" And then the final kind words as if its just another day in crazy town.\n\nAside from texts, he tends to make comments about things that no one will hear, like when no one is in the room with him, he'll say something just loud enough that I can vaguely make out some insult or observation he's made. It's literally like he's talking to some imaginary friend. Since he really doesn't care if anyone hears him, I think it means he's saying things he would like to reserve for nonexistent people more deserving of his thoughts, people he would prefer to converse with. You know, because everyone in his life is such a lesser being. I'm sure he thinks the masses would receive him quite well, as he has said he believes he could be a stand up comedian, but he's just too lazy to put in the work. lol\n\nSo when someone challenges a narcissist's worldview, it's like their entire tv show synopsis is being threatened.

So I'm still 15 but my brother is 21 and married now. \n\nThis story is the first of two personal stories of my abuse. So my dad is mostly verbally/emotionally abusive but has been physically abusive in the past. So this story starts off when I was 13, me and my dad, my brothers, and cousin where coming back from a gamestop after buying some things for my Xbox one. We had gotten home and all piled into my room. But just before my dad had came in he grabbed a can of condensed air which you use to get rid of dust from computers and things. When my dad came in the room he started spraying my brothers with the condensed air and before he sprayed me I put the hood of my coat up so he couldn't spray me. This for whatever reason made him mad so he did what any reasonable parents would do in the given situation. He decided to throw me against the dog cages that where in the corner o my room and then proceed to do it again when I stand back up. After the second time he threw me down I got up and sat down on my couch really quick and so does my dad. Once I thought it was over he punched me in the knee when I was sitting down and said \"you shouldn't get upset when someone is trying to play with you!\" And that's all for that story. \n\nOnto my brother's story. So my brother had turned 18 a few months back at the time and was hoping he would have more freedom from my dad. Well one night he came back after 10:00pm and my dad was mad. My brother was in the hallway almost in my dad's room's doorway. My dad was yelling at him for being home late when my brother said \"I'm 18 now so I can leave whenever I want\". This angered my dad which them went up to his doorway and threw my brother against the hallway wall. When my mom tried confronting my dad on this he said my brother was in his face when we all clearly saw that he wasn't and my dad eventually started going hysterical calling my mom a witch. And that was the end of that. \n\nFinally my last story is from me again. So a little context. My grandmother had died a few months prior and we had got a lot of her stuff. So this happened about three days after my brother's birthday. I went and grabbed a plate from our cabinet and went to get a slice of my brothers birthday cake. My dad saw me and told me to ask my brother first. I did and he said I could so I started making my way back to the kitchen. Now note the plate I had was one of our grandmothers and it was pretty small. I started to slightly toss the plate up and down on my hand when I got to the kitchen. As soon as I entered the kitchen the plate slipped out of my hand and shattered on the ground. At the time my dad was looking for something to eat in our fridge. He turned around and looked at the plate and then to me after which he goes and punches me as hard as he can in my chest. The punch knocks me back and I loose all the air in my lungs. I try to recover but then he punches me again and getting in my face and saying \"you don't get punished enough\". That's the last of the stories at the moment.

But it's something that kind of frustrates me, and it's just been gnawing at me for the last twenty years.  \n\nWhen I was growing up, a few things became very clear to me.\n\n1. Screaming and expressing anger are how to get obedience.  Greater volume equals faster compliance.\n2. Anger is best demonstrated by physically breaking something.\n3. Mistreating another person is how you demonstrate your superiority.  Intimidation is synonymous with respect.\n\nQuestion:  When did the rules change?\n\nI feel like these rules reflected reality up until I turned 22 or so.  And then, all of a sudden, this kind of behavior was no longer acceptable.  When I was a kid, violence was a normal part of lie.  You were allowed to be cruel and hateful to people, and the cruelest people were the ones who got the greatest rewards.  People respected the most hateful students in school.  My parents got compliance by smashing things.  If you didn't like someone, you just beat them up.  It was their own fault for deserving it.\n\nSo I accepted this as normal.  I went off to college.  I figured that if hateful, violent, people got respect and affection, I would be the most hateful and violent person I could be.  First, everyone feared and hated me, and then I got me into trouble with the cops.  So at this point I was still thinking, \"What the fuck?  Why does everyone get away with this but me?\"\n\nThen I entered the workforce.  Again, it was completely normal for superiors to treat junior employees with a mixture of abuse and condescension, and screaming.  Then by the time I got promoted to middle-management, this behavior was suddenly not okay anymore.  When I screamed at subordinates, I got in trouble for it.  Again...  \"What the fuck?  When did the rules change?  Why is this suddenly not okay?\"\n\nIntellectually, I get it:  Misbehavior was never to be okay, nobody appreciates hateful people, and getting abused isn't an excuse to abuse other people in return.  But here's my problem:  That is such a load of BULLSHIT.  Over and over and over in my life, I watched the shittiest, cruelest, most hateful people get rewarded while I got punished.  And then when I tried to do the same things they did, I got punished even more!  It doesn't make any sense and it frustrates the shit out of me to this day. \n\nRant over.

English is not my first language but I hope I won\u2019t screw up too much.\n\n\nI was never a girlie girl as a kid - more like a tomboy or a good mix between - \u00a0so it was rare that I wore a dress. It was after my first communion in my church . I must have been about 8 I think - but don\u2019t hold me to that.  Although I am not catholic anymore, I was back then. So it was obligatory to celebrate this occasion with my family - first in an all white dress and then I was made to switch into a cute little gown that my parents bought me and that I actually loved. It had a balloon like skirt - the ones that are really puffy-  and I loved to wear it even after that party.\n\nSo it was a short while after that, when I drove to the to a store with my bike to buy some comics.\u00a0\u00a0I lived very close to the shop, but there was no direct way because between the shop and my home was a building\u00a0I had to go around - either along a\u00a0street or through a very\u00a0small parklike thing with chess and pingpong tables and a playground. The playground was\u00a0separated from the tables through thick bushes where me and my\u00a0friends\u00a0always played hide and seek or safari back then.\u00a0\n\nAfter I happily purchased my stuff and went out of the store, I was greeted by a stranger. But this is a small town where everybody knew everybody, or so it seemed to me then, and he pretended to know my\u00a0parents. Since this wasn\u2019t even the first time someone knew my parents or grandparents while\u00a0I had no clue who it was,\u00a0I didn\u2019t think much of it. He seemed to be very interested in my comics and\u00a0I was\u00a0gullible enough not to realise what he really was up to. It was way\u00a0before \u00a0\u201cstranger danger\u201d really was a\u00a0thing.\n\nSo we talked about my comics and he wanted to read them with me. I thought this was a bit weird but as\u00a0I said,\u00a0I was naive back\u00a0then. So from the shop we went to go to my house along the park and to the playground while\u00a0I pushed my bike. Suddenly the guy\u00a0asked if we could sit a while on one of the benches by the\u00a0chess tables. I said\u00a0\u201c ok\" and so we sat there and he said\u00a0this was perfect to read my comic with him.\u00a0\u201cWhy not\u201d\u00a0I must have been thinking, because that was just what we did. As\u00a0I said,\u00a0I was so freaking naive, looking back on this\u00a0I just want to tell myself to just fucking run - but\u00a0I\u00a0wasn\u2019t\u00a0only naive -\u00a0although\u00a0I was a tomboy\u00a0I was socially awkward and it never crossed my mind to contradict a grown up or talk back. So, please don't  judge my 8 year old self too harsh.\n\nI didn\u2019t run- even\u00a0while\u00a0I thought it very strange that he moved closer and closer and closer and finally asked me to sit on his lap. Internally\u00a0I started to freak. But\u00a0I just\u00a0couldn\u2019t find the will or strength to speak up so\u00a0I awkwardly said yes and I sat on his lap.\u00a0\n\nHe laid his hand on my knee and - remember,\u00a0I wore a dress which made the following really f\u2026 easy for him -moved it slowly up my leg. I am not sure when\u00a0I\u00a0realised this, but\u00a0I kinda tried to wriggle away from it.\u00a0Which was exactly the wrong direction because\u00a0I had\u00a0nowhere to move but closer to him. Then\u00a0I felt his fingers at a place where no kid should be touched. Ever. I\u00a0still did not really\u00a0realise what was going on\u00a0or what exactly was happening to me right then, but\u00a0I knew\u00a0something was awfully wrong and\u00a0I really really\u00a0didn\u2019t like it.\n\nThat was\u00a0the moment\u00a0I just flipped. I told him\u00a0I had to go, with way more\u00a0confidence than\u00a0I really felt and as calm as\u00a0I could and he agreed -\u00a0I\u00a0don\u2019t know if it was because of that or if he formed\u00a0another plan or what exactly he was up to.\n\nHe then asked me to stay a moment while he went to pee in the bushes and that he would bring me home the. All my confidence used up i agreed.  I took my bike but\u00a0didn\u2019t drive away\u00a0immediately -\u00a0still a bit shocked\u00a0I think - when\u00a0I heard him from the bushes, calling to me to kiss his - as he called it -\u00a0peepee. Luckily\u00a0I got the hint that this was the perfect moment to book it - and so\u00a0I mounted my bike and\u00a0drove home. I guess\u00a0I must have appeared pretty freaked or even crying when\u00a0I came home, because my dad instantly knew something was wrong so\u00a0I told him what happened and he went to find him. I guess he never did. I asked him a few months ago and he\u00a0doesn\u2019t really remember\u2026.\u00a0\n\nBut I sure as hell do. I don't know what he looked like, so I won't ever be able to recognise him nowadays.\n\nSince then i started learning  krav maga and archery - ans i would love to train sword fight. i think every woman should be able to defend herself.

When we first met, I felt like something was different about him... like something was off. I noticed he was constantly criticizing other people, judging their sense of fashion, their acne scars, their weight, etc. I let it go thinking he was just judgemental and pretentious sometimes. But after being together for some time, I realized something is definitely wrong with him. After watching tons of videos and reading a bazillion articles, I am convinced he's a narcissist.\n\nHe tells me I am crazy, jealous, a crybaby, etc. He always \"jokes\" about having a threesome with other women. When I get upset at him for disrespecting me by making these jokes, he tells me I'm being insecure and jealous. I've threatened to leave him at least twice within our relationship, and he actually cried during these moments. Therefore, when he expresses some kind of emotion (which rarely happens), I fall for it. I don't know if it's an act or sincere. I read that sometimes narcissists do cry, but for selfish reasons.\n\nWhen we go out for food, it feels like he's always trying to compete with me for the wait staff's attention. He tries really hard to make really intense eye contact with waitors/waitresses but when they make more eye contact with me he'll say things like, \"Did you see that? He mostly only talked to you\" or \"She seems sexist. Let's not come here again.\" He looks at me like I'm an opponent. \n\nWhen I try to talk to him about my anxiety and depression, he tells me that everyone experiences these feelings and for me to just get over it. Also when I tell him about things that are meaningful to me like volunteerism or spending time with my nieces and nephews, he never cares to keep the conversation going. All he responds with is, \"That's nice\" or \"I'm glad you had a good day.\" And that's the end of the whole conversation. Therefore, I never feel connected with him... intellectually or emotionally or spiritually.\n\nI feel like I was such a different person before I met him. I was really loving and looked for goodness in people. All my friends tell me I'm an amazing person, but with him... he always tells me I'm terrible, jealous, crazy. Sometimes in a joking tone, but that doesn't make it hurt any less. I'm having a hard time leaving. I wonder if it's because I'm in my early 30s and I feel like time is running out for me and I'm afraid to die alone. Other times I tell myself that he's not so bad, and we have fun together... but then above all I just feel confused at the end of the day. Thoughts?", "subreddit": "NarcissisticAbuse"}

I had to fight. Fight my self and get better. Mentally, spiritually and emotionally. At the end of the day it came down to me KNOWING and BELIEVING I did not deserve what I got and I should NEVER EVER settle for such abuse. I was allowing some one to cause me so much pain and so many tears. I was suffering while they were \"living\" ( in their minds )Nope. Not anymore. I stopped giving that shit any power\n\n\\*I had to TAKE the NARC off the pedestal I put him on. I had to CRUSH the fantasy of what I thought he was and ACCEPT who he really was.

Although that was one of many disrespectful actions by him, the level of deception during that time traumatized me to the core.

I got very worried and replied, which was a big mistake because when he didn't respond I thought he was in danger and contacted him mom who told me that he is about to get married to the one that he cheated with. I confronted him/his fiancee via e-mail and told him that his lies need to stop. He responded by saying that he's happy and that I need to stop contacting them.

My employer promised me his full support and ordered me books to learn before it even began. The last two year were okay.\nNow he did tell me he wanted me to practice programming at home in the beginning. I honestly tried, but I'm depressed, I have no motivation for ANYTHING at home. I tried telling him. \"Please don't treat me differently at work, I just want you to know, I have depression and cannot do any more stuff at home.\" His reaction? \"I don't know what being depressed means.\" And never mentioning it again.\nHe also decided by himself I needed to become a frontend developer. I taught myself JavaScript from books and videos but he never gave me programming exercises (important).\n\nNow it's been three years and the apprenticeship will be over soon. In February he told me he can't hire me afterwards. Because \"your work isn't worth the same money I pay your coworker\" and I \"haven't practiced programming enough, so you don't have speed and experience\". Where should I have gained that? Under his supervision at work AS WAS HIS RESPONSIBILITY? No, it was MY fault. \"I saw huge potential in you but I seem to have been blind to how you really are.\" That hurt the most.\n\nSince then, I've fallen from grace. I had to give up all my responsibilities to our designer (months before I actually leave the company). He doesn't trust me with tasks anymore. I'm just his spellchecker at this point. When he smalltalks with the coworkers, I'm not allowed to join. He \"generously\" gives me \"advice\" that just insults me. \"Well you're bad at programming but you can do code reviews for a living! Or become a  Node.js backend developer if you don't like frontend!\" Those are not actual jobs. I'm not even sure he knows how insulting this is to me. Or he does it on purpose.\n\nThe last straw was a situation a few weeks ago. He entered the office, got mad at me and commanded me angrily to open a program. I opened it differently than he seemed to want me to, so I calmly explained to him what I did. He yelled: \"Get your act together! One more such thing and you can go home!\"\nI seriously believe he couldn't make the distinction between him being angry and me being angry. He seems to seriously think I was the angry one!\n\nI AM in counselling and my therapist says I should get the hell out of there.

He had mentioned how he was traveling to Chicago and was shady about the whole thing. No big deal to me as it doesn\u2019t affect our son. He just sent a video with a huge ceiling fan and asked that I please show our 23 month old. He does love fans. He then pans out to a ton of palm trees.

She was my biggest life lesson.", "author": "SensitiveDifficulty7", "self_text": "This is the story of my ex girlfriend and I. Started at the start of 2018 and ended at the end of 2018. She destroyed me beyond words and gave me PTSD. Today is the 3 months after she discarded me and I'm still trying to recover.\n\n**Idealization period**\n\nWe hit it off instantly on dating website. Chatted and talked for hours. She didn't have a profile picture but our sense of humor was almost identical. A week later we decided to meet for coffee. On my first sight, I knew it was her. First date went flawlessly. 8 hours, lots of laughs. From that point, every day we were together.\n\nIt felt like I was talking to myself in female form. The similarities were crazy. Started calling each other as soul mates. Made thousands of memories in just few months. Laying down and watching stars, supporting each other, shared our deepest secrets with each other. We created our secret language. We had a strange spiritual connection. (so many times I just felt something is wrong with her and she felt the same with me.) We were like kids in love.\n\n\"For the first time in my life, I feel safe and happy.\", she said. \"Why you didn't meet me before? All my life was pointless before you\", she said. \"Your body smell makes me feel so calm and I sleep like a baby in your arms.\", she said. She started calling the left side of my chest as \"Home\". \"Promise me, that I will be the only girl to lay down here. It is my home. Promise me that you will never leave me. You are my everything.\", she said.\n\nWe introduced each other to our families. We discussed which song to use for our marriage. We used to write poems for each other, went to bed at the same time just to hug each other and sleep. I would often watch her during her sleep and pray to god to not take her from me - ever. The whole thing felt like the movie, in fact I feel like I lived inside \"Eternal sunshine of the spotless mind.\" A deep love story between a shy guy and a crazy borderline girl.\n\nWhen she hug me, she would hug me for minutes, hurt my bones and smell my neck deeply with lots of kisses. I never felt that amount of love from anyone before.\n\nI would see people breaking up and just smile... because I thought what we had was special and what we had was true, unbreakable, karmic soul mate love. It wasn't based on money or looks. Just genuine true love, I thought. We decided to write a book for our love story and started writing it together. It included the poems we wrote for each other. It was our dream to give it to our kids as birthday present when they grow up so they would know how deeply we loved each other. We decided to meet at the same coffee shop, at the same, every year to celebrate our anniversary. We would take our coffee and go to the bench next to our special tree in the park, as it was our tradition. Every day, if we were not together, we would talk until morning.\n\nWe decided to start living together, as we just couldn't stay away from each other, and we would save money for the car if we pay only one rent instead.\n\nShe was my first sexual partner and we had it on my 30th birthday night. She told me I was amazing and thanked me for keeping myself pure for her. My confidence sky rocketed. I also had one of the most romantic first times ever - on my 30th birthday with my first girlfriend!\n\nThen, devaluation period started...\n\n**Devaluation period**\n\nAfter few months, she started being cold and distant. Told me that she was getting back into depression. I tried to convince her for therapy but it didn't work.\n\nShe started blaming me, giving the cold shoulder for tiny things. \"Why do you wear this shirt?\", \"Why did you put red pepper to the meat?\", \"I cooked for you, you do the dishes.\", \"Each time I cook, you have to say thank you.\". I'm a man capable of living on my own, so normally I clean my bedroom, do the laundry etc. She blamed me for cleaning my clothes in the washing machine as I'm an \"ignorant scum whom doesn't think about our country's electric resources.\"\n\nHer words became more and more harsh. I'm on top of my career, making around 200k+, but she told me I never work and I'm very lazy. She told me that I go to gym so I can look better to cheat on her in the future. (I was trying to look good to her, not to attract other women.) I told her that I love her and I have no reasons to cheat - she told me that: \"You will always wonder how it would feel with other women. It will always cross your mind.\"\n\nShe started talking with her ex, and each time they had a talk, she was sad for the entire day. I simply told her that I don't tolerate such stuff, not because I'm jealous; but she is getting sad each time they talk and I want my partner to be more positive. She told me that there is nothing going on between her and her ex, I'm jealous/controlling, yadda yadda.\n\nShe became even darker. According to her, I was a pussy, not a man, completely useless in bed (she said it when I lost my erection once. Turns out, I have latex allergy. I didn't know it as I never used condoms before.), sex is bad with me, I cannot make her feel like a woman, she is in depression because of me. I would try to stay calm, but feel sad and go to bed. Then she would blame for being sad. \"You are a man, you cannot be sad. Don't be moody. I didn't even offend you. What the fuck is wrong with you????\"\n\nOne day she was sick and I took care for her for the entire week. I left 15 minutes to buy her medicines, and when I came home, she started crying. \"You left me alone when I was dying! You are so cruel. How can I trust you if you leave me like this?\", I tried to explain her that I went to pharmacy to buy her medicines, but it felt like talking to a wall and nothing calmed her down. In fact, I told her before leaving.\n\nShe would forbid my masturbation and turn down sex. I had to explain her male anatomy, that it is important to have orgasm time to time to have a healthy life. She turned down sex for entire month and would get angry if I masturbate. Sometimes she would stop during mid sex, say that she is bored and go to sleep. I explained her blue balls and told her to help me finish at least... and she refused. She also refused helping myself... and I had to sleep with pain in my balls. (I think this is called physical abuse but I didn't know.) One day, she basically tried to rape me, even though I told her to stop many times. She angrily said \"How come I turn down sex with me. Aren't you a man? What the fuck is wrong with you?\". She slammed the door and left, only to come back in the morning and apogolize. (Maybe she cheated with someone on that night, I don't know.)\n\n**Discard period**\n\nShe started hiding her phone, chatted with someone under blanket during the nights. When I asked, she would tell me that she is cold. At this point we were like two strangers living in the same house. I still tried to save what we had by offering counseling but she rejected each time, telling that she will solve her issues on her own. We had sex time to time but I would rather masturbate. It was so stressful sleeping with her, as she could create drama any time.\n\nI asked Reddit for advices to save my relationship and help her with a fake account. People called her as \"Batshit crazy/narcissistic\" etc. and told me that I have to break up with her as soon as possible. She found this, cried all day because \"I let whole internet call her batshit crazy. What kind of awful boyfriend I am to do such stuff.\" She told me: \"Who are you going to listen? Some random awkward nerds whom do nothing all day but post relationship advices on stupid websites? Do you really gonna take their advice and break up? If so, so be it.\"\n\nAfter few weeks, at 4 AM, she woke me up for the talk. \"I'm losing my mental health. I will go to therapist. I'm very stressed lately.\", she said. I was so happy and told her that I support her decision and she can let me know if I can do something to support her. Then, she followed...\n\n\"This relationship was a mistake. We are just not compatible. You have no idea what you are doing in the bed. Because of you, I had sexual traumas.\". I told her that she knew that I was a virgin and I'm willing to practice and learn, then she followed: \"It just won't work, because I was never sexually attracted to you. I feel like kissing a brother when I kiss you. I gave this relationship a chance because you were so kind to me. All my past relationships had some sexual desire, but with you, we were friends first and I never had any sexual desire for you. You never had good sex in your life so you don't know how amazing it feels. I was like you when I was a virgin, then I gave my virginity to my ex boyfriend and realized how amazing it feels. I never turned sex with him and I was craving it all the time. With you, I had to make excuses and it gave me a lot of stress. I'm a mazoshistic and having pain turns me on. You are afraid to hurt me and this is not what I want. I want someone to throw me to walls and fuck me as hard as they can. You cannot do this because you are too pussy to do anything. I want to stay as friends with you because I believe we have something very special and I want to keep you in my life. I value you a lot but I cannot be your girlfriend anymore. Trust me, other women would be so lucky to have you. You were an amazing boyfriend. Let's stay as friends.\"\n\nI don't remember how I felt at that moment... it felt like I had blackouts for few minutes... Those words were coming from the person, for whom I would move mountains for. I told her: \"I will not stay as friends with you - and if you ever felt a tiny piece of love towards me, you should not come back to my life.\" Again, she became angry and started shouting. \"You never value me right? All you want is a girlfriend. I don't have any value as a friend.\" then she gave me the hardest word I've ever heard in my life. \"Nobody loved you in your entire 30 years of lifetime - why should I love someone that nobody else ever loved?\". \n\nI quickly left house and started walking in the streets until morning. Called my family (as I live alone in another country) and they tried to support me as much as they can. I cried badly for few hours to the point where I lost my breath.\n\nAfter the break up, even though she tried to hoover me few times, I'm strictly keeping no contact. Some of my friends told me that she was holding hands with another guy a week after we broke up. I don't know what feels worse. Falling in love with some fake persona whom I thought to be my soulmate, or her final words which crushed me.\n\nI'm still seeing her in my dreams, like nothing happened, and her words from idealization period comes back. \"I hope I can hug you before sleep for the rest of my life, you are my teddy bear.\", \"Look at those old couple... promise me that one day we will grow old together, just like them.\", \"You are my everything.\", \"You are the only reason to keep my in life, don't ever leave me...\". I'm shaking when I hear our special song. My sexual confidence is crushed and thoughts of sex make me very stressed. I'm emotionally numb and I cannot connect with any woman.\n\nI thought about leaving this country, drinking until I pass out, and it felt like I have no reason to live anymore... then I decided to stay strong and direct this deep love towards myself. I'm not going anywhere. If I bump into her, she will bump into me, and she will see what she lost. She will never lay down on my arms ever again. One day, I will find another woman, connect to her deeply and make her my queen. At best, she will be whore of some abusive asshole. I'm directing all my anger/pain/regret/energy inside me into body building and I keep breaking my own records. Arms are getting buffed and six pack is almost visible! I'm having a blast in my career because I don't waste my energy thinking of her or the relationship problems. I wanted to heal her scars with love, but she preferred abusive sadistic people to give her more scars. She is constantly on my mind, but hopefully one day I will wake up without thinking of her at all...\n\nJust wanted to get it out from my chest.", "subreddit": "NarcissisticAbuse"}

Now if my goal were to STAY with this partner and make things work, I think that would be completely what a therapist should do! And I should be trying to empathize as much as possible with my partner and reflect on where I've gone wrong/things I should apologize for or improve, etc. BUT if my goal is to LEAVE the relationship after a pattern of the partner behaving toward me in ways that compromise my mental health, etc., I think it's actually HARMFUL for me to engage in this reflective exercise too much (especially given that people who are traumatized and have been gaslit tend to internalize things and blame themselves excessively)...basically I finally ended things with my nex on Saturday in a text fight and I showed it to my therapist and she thought I was being kind of unreasonable and she saw his point of view and encouraged me to send a conciliatory follow-up text saying something to the effect of too bad things ended on this kind of note/I think there were some misunderstandings, etc. I had been feeling really good about the ending up until now and all my friends had thought I had been reasonable enough/that it was good I had finally walked away and stood up for myself. But now, after this therapy appointment, I'm left ruminating and wondering if I should follow up with this person and say something conciliatory, I'm wondering if I was wrong about him the whole time and maybe he wasn't so bad after all, etc. Its' really KILLING me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nDoes anyone else have this kind of experience??

I tried to get out in the beginning, but we were so close so fast, spent every second together, and I made excuses for his behavior. I told myself \"he has a big heart\" to justify his terrible life choices. But we had fun together, I knew he'd never cheat on me (I don't think he ever actually has), and he always said the right things. \"I'm going to marry you by the end of the year\" - we started dating in May. \"I want to start a family with you ASAP.\" \"I've never been loved by anyone like you before.\" \"I'll never leave you, I'm a loyal dude.\" \"You're burned into my soul.\" \"You're my best friend and the love of my life.\" It's hard to believe and accept that a narcissist is totally capable to acting like they feel these things, when they 100% do not.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHe and his father are full-blown alcoholics. He has an 8 year old daughter who lives with his mom, and when I told him their relationship made me uncomfortable at times (i.e. she constantly puts herself  between us, she thinks she dictates when I come around and don't, and she is flat-out rude), and I asked him to help improve it, but the problem was always with me. Not the fact that he's not parenting his child or raising a respectful, independent little girl.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAt the beginning it was fun, and he made it seem like he'd always be there, and he'd do anything for me. We moved in together after 5 months, and right around that time is when things started to turn. All of the sudden he was going to do whatever he wanted, whenever he wanted. Mind you, he hardly saw his child at the beginning because he refused to be away from me, now that I didn't much care for her, he wanted to be around her all the time. He purposely would go get drunk before we had plans because he knew  I didn't like being around him while he was drinking and I was sober. He also gets drunk and sees things that don't really happen- like me hooking up with his best friend while his gf was sitting right there - never happened. Or how I \"flirt with every guy at the bar\" - also not true. It got to the point where I thought maybe I was just acting so far out of character when we'd go drinking and just not remembering it, until it happened when I was stone cold sober one day, when I realized it was all in his head.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI moved out after about 9 months because it was getting worse and worse. We tried to make it work a few times, I got all of the broken promises about seeking help, setting boundaries with his daughter and family, and being more responsible with money. A few days after reconciling and believing him, he'd always go back to doing whatever he wanted to do. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOne time I left and tried to move on - right before his best friend unexpectedly passed away. Went on two dates with a new guy, and the new guy took it upon himself to tell my nex about our \"relationship\" (another narcissist?) - without discussing time frame (we weren't together and I wasn't seeing the new guy after me and nex reconciled), but I believe this dealt such a large blow to his ego that I was genuinely scared for my safety. He showed up at my apartment with a key I didn't know he had to scream at me at 2am. He was circling my block multiple times looking for my car - which I was parking 7-8 blocks away. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHe has regularly not taken any accountability for his part in our issues - how he pitted me and his child against each other, how he's fed his mom all kinds of awful information about me that isn't true or is only part of the story, or how I found him drunk at a bar at noon and that's why we split and I tried to move on in the first place. It's always me, I'm always the problem, I'm the one who needs help (and at this point I probably do), and I've even been accused of being a narcissist. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOn multiple occasions I've totally lost it and gotten angry and even violent to the point where I don't recognize myself. I find myself chasing him around town to catch him in lies, unable to focus on work because I'm obsessing over what he's really doing, and I've been embarrassed and scared for my safety more times than I care to admit. In the moment, I'm something I don't want to be, and I feel awful and try to fix all the things I did after the fact. I don't owe him that, and I know that now.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNeedless to say, it's been awful. The other day I decided I truly wanted to be done. His daughter deserves a dad who is in her life even if he is raising an entitled brat, he is a grown man and should be able to drink as much and as often as he wants, and he is solely responsible for making his own financial mistakes, it's not my job to prevent them or fix them. I told him we were done unless he was going to rehab, and doing better by his child. So why is it so hard for me to let go? Last night I went to his house to find his ex gf, they're now friends, in OUR bed we shared almost every night, fully clothed and just \"sleeping it off\" while he crashed on the couch, but inappropriate nonetheless. And certainly behavior he would not approve of from me. I've called all day today, and he's shut off his phone completely, which he knows drives me nuts. So why do I want to know if he's going to come back around and work this out? If he's going to change? If i'm making a terrible decision? If he's even a narcissist at all? Did our relationship just go south like any other relationship with people who weren't meant to be together would? Am I a narcissist? This is so hard.", "subreddit": "NarcissisticAbuse"}

I\u2019ve known all along something wasn\u2019t right, but only the last 3 years did I learn about narcissism and make the connection. So for 18 years I thought the problem was me. That I was asking too much, too needy and too sensitive, I was overly jealous and insecure and had a bad temper. I accused him numerous times of cheating but never found undeniable evidence of an affair. \n\nI accepted for years that I was the \u201ccrazy, jealous girlfriend\u201d stereotype. I was, and still am, ashamed of my accusations and suspicions and the drama that ensued from each accusation. I feel very guilty for them since I have found no actual proof. \n\nThe last accusation happened three and a half years ago. I can not let this one go. I was able to \u201clet go\u201d of my suspicions from the previous times even though I never felt satisfied in his answers because I had no solid proof, just \u201ca feeling\u201d  from circumstantial evidence and a change in his behavior. We all know how narcs make us feel about our feelings so I figured he was right and my feelings, as usual, were \u201cwrong\u201d.  Also, I knew I was upset by his behavior and felt disrespected so I was aware those feelings fed my \u201cjealousy\u201d. \n\nNow, after researching narcs and their abuse, I realize I was upset because of his not respecting my feelings and boundaries that I thought were normal for couples. Of course I didn\u2019t know this then so I thought I must be over the top with my expectations for his behavior around other women because of my \u201cjealousy\u201d. \n\nA little background to his treatment of me concerning other women leading to my accusations throughout those first 18 years before I found out what he is. \n\n- in the beginning he would point out other women he thought were \u201chot\u201d and tell me he would \u201cdo them\u201d when we were driving around. It took me 6 months to get him to stop. \n\n- when we first moved in together he put a small stuffed animal with an earring in its ear that his ex girlfriend gave him on display on his dresser! After four months of arguing about it I finally threw it out one day while he was at work. He was furious! I was not sorry. I thought it was fucked up to leave on display in our room! \n\n- I would find pictures of models in bathing suits in his phone but not one picture of me\n\n- he has given my stuff away to his friends girls friends without asking me, even if I\u2019m standing right there! \n\n- he never introduces me to people he knows that I don\u2019t know, both men and women.  When I get mad he tells me I\u2019m a big girl and can introduce myself. I agree but tell him I\u2019d like him to let these people know I\u2019m important to him by introducing me, that it\u2019s polite. He tells me manners are a waste of time. It took over a decade for him to do it, sometimes. \n\n- one time he ran into a women from his past who I didn\u2019t know. He hugged her and introduced our daughter who was on his left while I was on his right. After introducing our daughter he turned his back on me and walked away with this woman chatting away leaving me standing there feeling invisible and unloved. Zero acknowledgment that I was his girlfriend or even alive! \n\n- he has hung out with other women in our bedroom while I was not home.  He couldn\u2019t understand why it bothered me. \n\n- he told me a woman he was working for was \u201can older lady\u201d but it turns out she was younger than both of us and really pretty\n\n- another woman he worked for and spent hours alone with sent him two inappropriate texts for what is supposed to be a professional relationship (the texts were \u201cI want to hire you to come \u201cplay\u201d with me re: cables for my deck\u201d, and \u201c today\u2019s a perfect day to cuddle on the couch and watch old movies, but let\u2019s fight the urge\u201d. It took over a year for him to admit they were inappropriate and unprofessional. His argument is I was taking them out of context. \n\n- another woman he worked for and spent hours alone with when picking him up one day he comes out of her house drinking a beer and she started rubbing his shoulders and he started moaning in response. He refused to admit that that crossed the line of professionalism. \n\n- when asking him to  keep a professional and hands free (no shoulders rubs, hugs, etc) interaction with women he works alone with he said he didn\u2019t want to be rude and tell them no if they asked for a hug. I told him it isn\u2019t rude to decline to allow someone to touch you and he could blame it on me and kinda laugh it off and say \u201cmy wife prefers I keep my hands to myself so I\u2019ll decline if you don\u2019t mind\u201d.  But he\u2019s worried about being rude when he tells me manners are a waste of time? He tells me he just wants the work and if he has to hug them to get paid it\u2019s not a big deal. I do understand the work aspect but I waitressed for years and told lots of people not to touch me and it never cost me a tip or a job and was never awkward. There\u2019s plenty of nice ways to tell someone not to touch you. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s unreasonable for me to ask for this. But is it? Maybe my inability to trust him due to his lack of trust building behavior (he did the bare minimum both financially and domestically throughout the relationship until about 2 years ago when he knew I was seriously over this shit he stepped up quite a bit for him, close to full time work and started doing his own laundry and cooking and doing dishes more often than not. It wasn\u2019t just other women issues but lack of respect across the board). \n\nThere\u2019s many more instances of, in my opinion, inappropriate behavior around other women and numerous other lies I\u2019ve caught him in numerous lies regarding other women. And at  no point has he ever admitted any of it would bother him if the roles were reversed. I know they would as he has flipped out on me for far less (while playing Xbox once a guy asked me what I was wearing and I responded \u201cjeans and a hoodie\u201d and my narc got really mad. Told me I was disrespecting him by engaging and encouraging the guy online who I would never meet and didn\u2019t even know his real name and would probably never even run into online again!) \n\nSo in the interest of keeping this short (lol) does my \u201cjealousy\u201d seem like a normal reaction to disrespectful behavior thereby making it a \u201ctrust\u201d issue and not  jealousy? I\u2019ve been trying to figure this out and my reasoning is that it is a trust issue and I\u2019m not really a jealous person (I don\u2019t have jealousy issues with any other person and didn\u2019t with guys I dated before him.) I think that when my narc won\u2019t admit to the basics (like being mad if I was doing what he was doing) then I don\u2019t think I can trust anything else he says on the subject and so it escalates to accusations of infidelity. Am I wrong for escalating to accusations? Or is that the expected normal response under my circumstances?\n\nSorry this is so long and thanks for sticking it out! I\u2019m trying to figure out what is my response to his abuse and what is actually me that need working on so any advice or insight is greatly appreciated! \n\n", "subreddit": "NarcissisticAbuse"}

Her hub came home from his trip and saw that she had been FaceTiming someone. And her MIL is staying with them for 8 weeks. She is ALSO abusive and watching her like a hawk, and apparently hit her for \u201cmaking sex videos\u201d which apparently is FaceTiming if you are old and out of touch. \nWhen she reached out, it was like one of those soldier coming home dog videos. I was over he moon however we both know how careful we need to be. \nHe took away her phone but she was able to hack her Switch to allow web. We also played smash bros and she kicked my ass repeatedly. \nAnyway I\u2019m glad she is alive and well, that was my main concern. I found out without going to extremes. When her MIL is gone I plan on visiting her. \nThanks for your words and I\u2019ll keep you posted as \nevents develop \n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\n\nThis will be long. Bear with me. \nI am utterly and totally in love with a woman who lives in the next state over. She is married to an abuser, emotional and physical. She wants to leave, but has kids to consider, no job (never had one), no vehicle, no freedoms to leave the house, the list goes on. Regarding physical, he punishes her sexually (basically rape), pushes her around, has stabbed her with a pen, just crazy things. Yet, he \u201cloves her\u201d and \u201cwill change\u201d.  They have recently moved to this other state away from family and friends and she knows nobody. \n\nMost recently, her phone has gone radio silent. We used to text, chat, phone, and FaceTime every day but it\u2019s just ended. He restricts her internet and was actually lucky that we met, which was online. He doesn\u2019t allow adult websites meaning anything not geared towards toddlers. \n\nAnyway, it\u2019s been a week and I am pulling my hair out. I can\u2019t contact her, I\u2019ve tried using different phones, nothing. I can\u2019t write a letter in case he opens it. I\u2019ve debated having the police to a wellness check for me, I\u2019ve also considered driving the three hours and just showing up but there\u2019s risks with all of this. I just started a new job so PTO isn\u2019t available yet unfortunately. \n\nI suppose it\u2019s possible she is ghosting me, but I really don\u2019t think so. The last phone convo was so sweet and loving I can\u2019t imagine she has turned or changed her mind. It\u2019s also possible she lost her phone but still I don\u2019t think so. She hasn\u2019t visited a couple of the sites she usually does and has access to, and she hasn\u2019t been on her switch online in the same amount of time. \n\nOf course, I\u2019m also concerned that she is dead in a ditch somewhere. Her hub posted some nonsense on FB recently nothing a sane \u201cgrieving husband\u201d would post, and her step parents\u2019 posts have been normal so I think her safety is ok. \n\nYour turn. Is there a service that isn\u2019t the police that can deliver a message on my behalf? Should I contact the subreddit in that city and see if anyone would be willing? I just don\u2019t know what to do. Imagine being totally in love with someone and contact and their whole being just disappears. I need to know that she has my contact info, and can call whenever. And that she is ok. And that I will always be there for her. \n\nThank you", "subreddit": "emotionalabuse"}

Long post", "author": "byrddie", "self_text": "I genuinely don\u2019t know what is true and what was fake. Some background: I (19F) never had a boyfriend and had been abused my whole life. I was terrified of men before I met him. The first time i saw him I immediately had a crush. I never have crushes and have never been immediately attracted to someone. He (25m) was my manager at my new job. After a year of working together he finally made a move. He came over one night and I\u2019ve been terrified of intimacy so none of this is like me. He spent the night the first night (uninvited he just never left) and we kissed and he gave me a note he wrote the other day confessing his attraction to me. Within two nights of us hanging out he told me he loved me which I thought was odd but I kinda thought I loved him too. It quickly turned into him spending the night every night. I had to take him to and from work and bring him lunch because he would let his friend use his car. A week after we started dating I had to have surgery to remove a tumor. He came over as soon as I got out of the hospital and he told me he was on acid this was also the first time he was meeting my mom. I was obviously upset and noticed all the red flags but I thought that since we rushed into everything so quickly we just didn\u2019t really know each other. He always told me I was the most beautiful girl he ever met and I was out of his league. He was also very jealous of any man in my life. But when one of my drunk guy friends got aggressive towards me he didn\u2019t even care. Also his best friend really creeped me out and when I told him he brushed it off. Less than a month after dating he\u2019s talking about marriage and kids and convinced me to kick out my roomate(who was very toxic) and that he would move in with me and we basically already lived together. I had a lot of doubts but he was renting his old place to a friend so I thought if it ever went bad it wouldn\u2019t be that big of a deal. He started withholding affection. He didn\u2019t have sex with me or even touch me for a month. When I told him this hurt my feelings he said that I have to initiate it. He was also very passionate about his music but it started to become his whole life. Whenever he was home he would have a guitar in his hand never fully talking to me. When I expressed concern he told me that it was his one true passion in his life and if I didn\u2019t like it leave. It quickly took over my whole life and my whole house was covered in bands he liked and his instruments. He also told me about how crazy his exs were before we started dating. And when I said anything about his music he would immediately get mad saying that his ex made him quit music and that I was bringing him back to that time. I recently got diagnosed with a disease that causes chronic pain and effects my fertility. He was never sympathetic to this and still talked about me having his kids despite it hurting me. Then our arguments started become more and more twisted. For example \u201cit really hurts my feelings when you comment on my eating habits because I used to have a eating disorder could you please be mindful\u201d. And it would somehow end with me crying and apologizing to him. He was always so charming to everyone else though. He would never talk to me or make any plans with me. When I would make them he would always cancel and say he forgot. I also did all the cooking, cleaning and grocery shopping. He hung out with friends at least 3 times a week but would leave me to sit on the couch sick and waiting for him to come home. I broke down one night and told him that I had been suicidal and he just stared at me while I was sobbing in the floor. He could never admit to any mistake he did and if even slightly raised my voice or used a curse word he would leave and tell me I act like his ex and I\u2019d have to beg for him to come back. He talked shit about my whole family and my friends and that they didn\u2019t treat me right. Fast forward to last week I bought him concert tickets and planned a whole trip for us and barely got a thanks. Then he started initiating sex every night which was really weird for him and being very loving during but not before or after. I finally felt good about our sex life and that he cared. But we were getting into big arguments every night too. One day I was really anxious and just asked for him to talk to me and he kept getting mad about me interrupting his music. Which then turned into I ruined everything and I\u2019m just jealous and threatened to leave. The next day I told him we needed to talk and instead of coming home he hung out with his friends for hours and when he did come home he only talked about how I had hurt him last night. I started to say that he needed to be more understanding of my disease because it\u2019s going to effect my whole life. I haven\u2019t been able to eat solid foods for two months and have lost fifteen pounds. He then said that if you want me to be the kind of guy to wait on you hand in foot that I better give up now because he\u2019s not that kind of guy. I started to realize I needed to break up but we had plans the next day and I wanted to see how they turned out. The next day he didn\u2019t wake me up and I slept past our plans. When I got upset that he didn\u2019t wake me up and he was playing music when the whole house was a mess. He started crying which he never did so I apologized and gave him his time. We made new plans and while out shopping he told me to get whatever I want and whatever will make me happy. We were supposed to do other things but after he immediately started driving home and I had to beg him to go to the grocery store. He wouldn\u2019t buy anything for himself and kept asking if I got everything I needed to last a few days. Then when we got home he basically did every thing that he knew would upset me and left again to hang with friends because he needed space. I knew I was going to break up with him but when I called him he hung up on me. He can home at 2 am and broke up with me first and said that i was insecure and sensitive but he still loved me and wanted me in his life when I said no he threw a box across the room and started screaming at me saying it was all my fault. As he was packing up his things I took the camera I bought for him and he threw a fit. I wouldn\u2019t normally do that but it was $500 and he never got me anything. I sold some of my things to afford it. I\u2019m just confused because when I tried to talk to him to get closure he said that he would never talk to me again. I thought usually in abusive relationships they always beg for you back? It\u2019s only been 6 days since the break up but I don\u2019t think he ever will not that I want him to but just confused.

She says things like 'I know what you're thinking, but trust me, I feel completely safe and he would never hurt me' and I feel like I just haven't understood their relationship and I don't say anything. But now I am looking back at everything and trying to figure out how on EARTH I been lead to believe that things are fine.\n\nI now know that I really need to say something, because I am at a point where I am scared he will hurt her. I just have no idea how to do it. I am thinking of saying something like 'I am only saying this because I really care about you...I am really worried about how X is treating you. I think you deserve someone who will treat you with more respect. I know you say he would never hurt you, but things have been escalating, and if he is capable of punching holes in the wall, he is capable of hurting you'.\n\nI need advice on what the best possible way to do this is, without causing her to get defensive. I know she is sensitive about him, so I would hate for her to push me away and lose the support of someone who is actually concerned for her wellbeing.\n\n&amp;#x200B;", "subreddit": "abuse"}

(Very Long Read)", "author": "SilverlonewolfX", "self_text": "I am not good at writing even though I am an American.... Bear with me.   \n\n\nHow to start this? I will make this short as possible. Still it is a story of the abuse I went through. So grab a snack or a drink if you want to read this. Its long. Real long.  \n\n\nMy father, mother and I never got along. I was the black sheep when it came to the family mentality. I was a rebel. An outsider. My father would think beating me would set me right but, really it didn't. This began in New York City when I lived around Avenue K.  \n\n\nMy first time remembering his abusive ways was when I was a little kid, going to school (P.S 115.) I cried that I did not want to leave on my first day... This embarrassed my parents, so when I got home my father tied me up (Hands and feet), and placed a chair before me.  He broke a broom in half. Not the aluminum ones. This is the end of the 80s and the start of the 90s when brooms sticks where still made of heavy wood. He would raise my tied up legs so I was in a L pose with my back on the floor. He sat in the chair and my legs are now between his legs.  He used the stick to hit the soles of my feet, as hard as he can. I do not remember what happen after.  \n\n\nAlso we had this dirty furnace room. It was tiny with a water heater and other things. I think a air central conditioning unit. He would throw me in there when I do something bad and the furnace would make sounds that I did not like. My father said there is a monster in there lurking and he hoped it eats me. This traumatized me as a kid.  \n\n\nI also remember him holding my head. He is a pretty big guy. His hand did wrap around half my head. He picked me up and smashed my cranium through the dry wall.  \n\n\nAnother punishment he does that is a slightly passive was this. Imagine you are made to face a wall. You put your hands high over your head touching the wall and made to stand on one leg... for hours.  \n\n\nLast thing I remembered before we moved to another area was that my father took the same broom stick and beat me like a pinata on my right hip. There was massive bruising there. I was limping. My teacher noticed and suspected abuse when I showed it to her. I lied though. My father made me lie.  \n\n\nThen we moved to Sheepshead Bay. I kind of liked it there. On weekends my mom and I go out. She will check out the fish market, where fishermen sell their catches.   \nHowever, the abused of course continued. My father slapped me around for playing with a worm. I was 10 at the time and I know now it is normal for boys around my age to play with creepy crawly things. When my father slapped it was not the ones that make your face turn. No. He does it as hard as he can knocking me to the floor.  \n\n\nI misbehaved at school again, and my father woke me up at 1 in the morning. This was my first time being awake this late at night. He asked \"You know what time it is?\" And I remember shaking my head. He replies. \"Its 1 in the morning.\" and I was confused. As a kid I thought night meant darkness and morning means when the sun rises. I remembering replying. \"Its not morning. Its still night.\" I am not sure what what said after that but I do remember my father made me do the hands up and stand on one leg on the wall thing for the rest of the morning until the sun rose. I was tired as a overworked mule when I went to school.  \n\n\nThere were fights between my mother and my father. Sometimes the fights got so bad, he spends the night at a friend's place leaving my mother in tears. Sometimes he got physical. Rewind to when I was a child, before I went to school. I remember I saw my first fight between them. I had to be maybe 3 or 4 years old. My mother took scissors out to defend herself and I can tell now my father is holding her back from stabbing him. It was brutal.  I was hiding in the shadows, the far side of the living room watching. I did not understand what was happening that time.   \n\n\nWhen the fight was over my father took her to the bed room and locked the door. I came out of hiding, and saw drops of blood for the first time. It was on the floor. I did not know what it was. I remember thinking it has to be rubies. Like the jewel on one my mother's rings I like to look at when she held me. She wears three rings. I touched it and it was water, and I thought to myself \"Water rubies?\"   \n\n\nNow fast forward back to me being 10. I was tied up a lot, beaten, punished for the slightest misbehavior. Children around my age love to explore things and touch. My father hated that. When I would go shopping with them I would touch things, to see how they worked. I had a knack for touching things, looking, exploring with my hands. Taking apart my toys and see the inner workings and understand how it worked. It was my way to explore the world. I understood engines and car maintenance at such a young age. My father would take me to the junk yards a lot to look for car parts. As he is busy I would mess around with things. My hands covered in rust and grease.  \n\n\nIf I was caught touching things in stores, when I got home I got a beating. Another way, he would make me hold out my hands, palms up. Then use a spatula. He would hold the flat end and hit my hands as hard as he can with the handle end.   \n\n\nI had a hard time focusing, cause of ADHD. My father would give me assignments during summer vacation. Such assignments are like, memorize the capital cities of each country. Where each country is at in the world. Multiplication, division. Making me write everything in a book he highlighted and it was a lot.  It was hard. I just couldn't focus. He beat me if I didn't get it done or properly memorized. He will not stop until I was broken in spirit and refuse to get up.  \n\n\nOne time he spat in my face for not getting a chapter in a book written down on paper. The mucus was all over my face. When I went back to school new school year, math was getting harder. Words and literature was becoming advance. Cause of this I could not focus.  I was placed in special ed for this reason. I was bullied a lot too.  \n\n\nI wanted to be normal. I wanted to be like the other kids. Have a normal life. I even begged my parents to put me on medication to help me... but they refused. Because of the abuse, and how empty I felt, and realizing I wasn't a normal kid at the age 11, I wanted to commit suicide. Some serious people got into this and I had to attend therapy and special classes to deal with this for awhile.   \n\n\nAlso my father is a Muslim, and around this time forced me to memorized things in the Quran. He'd tortured me, like placing a pencil between fingers and squeeze down on my hand. I can feel the finger bones around the pencil bending causing a great surge of pain. He'd do this if I get one thing wrong. What is worse, I did not speak Arabic.  So to me, I had to memorize gibberish.  \n\n\nAge 12, we moved from New York City to Columbus, Ohio. There is a strong Islamic presence there and my father wanted to be around that. Shortly after the move, my mother who is a Chinese Buddhist converted to Islam. My father got her tapes that talked about the Quran in Chinese, so she can understand.   \n\n\nI was failing at 5th grade, and I did my best, but it wasn't enough for my father ofc. I would hide my report cards and lied to them I lost it. I did not want to show him my failing grades. When he found them, oh I was in for a world of pain. He told my mother to get out of the apartment. She protested but demanded her and she relented. I forgot to mention my sister, she was 4-5 around that time. So my mother took her too with her.   \n\n\nMy father went to town on me. Tied me up with rope and tape. Gagged my mouth so I could not yell and started wailing at me with fists. He even picked me up and threw me across the living room a couple of times. Cause my legs and hands are bound, I was like dice getting tossed at a casino. I landed whatever side was facing the ground. He knocked my bottom left canine tooth out.  \n\n\nThankfully that was a baby tooth. A new one replaced it, and its longer than the others. A reminder where the tooth had broke.   \n\n\nAnother time I am not sure what I did, but I remember him tying me up and placing a knife to my throat. Threatening me to slaughter me like a lamb. He has put a knife to my throat so many times. Even now as a adult if my neck and throat is touched by someone, I wig out. I go from 0 to angry and scared when touched there.  \n\n\nStill I got into trouble. Still I was a trouble maker.  \n\n\nAge 15, my parents moved to Florida. In New Port Richie my uncle convinced my father and mother to moved there. Also the Islamic presence there is strong too. So it convinced my parents to move and try to make it work there.  \n\n\nThe beatings have almost stopped. Like literally almost stopped. My father worked long hours and only saw him at dinner before I did homework and went to bed. The first time I was able to focus in school better. I was much more well behaved. My self esteem shot through the roof. I made friends. The hot weather, I enjoyed it! My uncle took me almost every weekend fishing. He would even get me rental videos for VHS to watch. ((One video was a anime that show tits. Oh god my parents would have flipped if they saw that))   \n\n\nI was a happy teenager!  \nThe higher taxes there  made my mother work too. Both my parents are too busy working. I was okay with this as I barely had to spend time with them when I got a loving uncle. I got to spend time with my friends. The only trouble I would get into was messing with fire ant hills as I love pissing those things off. I had awesome teachers at, Seven Springs Middle School. My grades shot up, as well as my mental and physical health was getting better and better. I was tan and lean and was a handsome young man. Everything was looking good for me.   \n\n\nHowever, it was not to last. We did not stay even for a year. Because how my parents had to work like dogs, they decided to move back to miserable Columbus Ohio. My uncle gave my parents a massive roll of paper to use as packaging for the frail items like dishes and vases. This thing was heavy. I brought this up as this is important later.  \n\n\nIn the middle of cold autumn too. The sudden climate change screwed my body up. I got the chicken pox again. So literally I got the chicken pox twice! Once when I was a kid and then as a teenager.   \n\n\nCause of the school I had to go to, it was in the ghetto. I was bullied a lot. My father is less busy so the beatings came back. I was very miserable. Suicidal. Reckless. What even crazier, my father was a trucker. How he supported the family since I was 11. He take me in the truck on weekends and lecture me and  beat the crap out of me while I seated in the passenger seat.   \n\n\nThen this day I will never forget. It's the day that changed me forever and I know it. Big story short, the day I got in trouble for climbing the open cafeteria windows to flirt with some girls eating lunch. When my father got home and heard the news... He loses it. Remember that big roll of paper? Well he took that and threw it on my head. I had to be rushed to the E.R and get 13 stitches. So much blood. I was concussed. Confused.   \n\n\nMy mother begged me to lie. So I did to the doctor saying a large china dish fell on my head as I was horsing around.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe beatings and punishment got worse and worse. My father would make me stand in the middle of the living room all night some days. If I fell asleep on the floor, he'd kick me on the sides like a dog. He prohibited me from moving that sometimes I would be asleep on the floor and I accidentally urinated on my myself. So I had to run to the bathroom to pee out the rest before I made a mess. I would then go back to standing in the middle of the living room in the dark until my body and mind is too tired.  \n\n\nI couldn't take it anymore. I was cutting myself. Shop lifting. Stealing bikes. Causing trouble for the neighbors. Smoking. I was venting my frustration, my anger, and my sadness out by doing crimes. When I steal, I did not steal cheap stuff. I stole gameboys and games. I stole from stores, friends and so on. Each time I did it, I got better at it. I felt hollow inside once again and doing these things made me felt alive. I bury my head in games I stole to drown the world out. Make me forget my problems. My mental problems decline real fast too. I was spiraling out of control.  \n\n\nI was bullied a lot at school, so as petty revenge some of the bullies played football. I would pretend to go home. Once most the students left I would return in different attire I had in my backpack. I would sneak into their locker rooms while they are at practice and my fingers got real sticky for their money. Most did not use locks on their lockers and I did this a handful of times. Cause of this, people wonder who the thief was and no one suspected it was me.  \n\n\nI started to run away from home too. The frequency picked up on the runaways. If I had $100 for every time I runaway from home, I could afford a house or a super car by the time I was 18. I was caught a lot by police and they would send me though different children services. One place I visited more times I care to count was called the, Huckleberry House. A short term living place for troubled children and teens. It was like a short stop so children services can figure out what to do with the children.  \n\n\nAnother time I was caught I was sent into a mental ward for kids and teens. Where I was diagnosed with ADHD and bipolar. The medication help... but just barely.  \n\n\nThen I did the biggest crimes in my life.... I wanted to go back to Florida. I wanted to feel safe and free again. I needed money though. So, one morning I skipped school, and went to a supermarket. I set fire in the car isle where I know all the flammable stuff was... My goal was to rob the registers as people left the store for safety, and use the money to get to Florida.   \n\n\nI was caught.... Police took me home with a court date and everything as there was no substantial proof I did it. They had to look at evidence and footage.  My father was at work, and he threaten to kill me as soon as he got home. I tried running away again but my mother blocked the door. I never touched my mother, but in desperation I had to. I pulled and dragged her from the door and ran out.  \n\n\nI was lost and confused and very scared for my life. Night settled, I was still determined to get to Florida. That is all on my mind. Get to Florida and be safe. I felt like I died inside. So night came, and I broke into a small collectibles store. Broke the door window with a log i found, I got in and took the register and got out quick. It was locked, so I took it to a feild and tossed it around and banged it with rocks till it opened. Nothing but change, but I took every penny, nickle, dime and quarter. Then I walked for an hour, and I went to Meijers when they started having those coin counters. I manage to get over 200 dollars. I tried shop lifting for supplies I needed on my trip but was caught.   \n\n\nI was sent to Juvenile jail in the Franklin County District in Columbus. I was let out a few weeks later, given probation for a year with some community service. It was to school, work and back home. Still, I did things if I knew I can get away with it, to feel alive. Stealing. Smoking. That kind of stuff. My father got more violent with me and tried to drill Islam into my head even harder. He thinks that it should help me with my problems. Beatings and abuse still continued and I was powerless.  \n\n\nThen the neighbors kids started to bully me. Beating me up and so on. On the last two weeks of my probation.... I made a Molotov cocktail. I was planning to threaten the bullies with it if they do not leave me alone. Well... they ran away to a cop that was rolling down the streets. Yep... busted. So I was given another year of probation and this time with an ankle monitor.  Because I was still causing trouble in school, and I was bullied and I am violating my probation time to time, my lawyer stepped in. I was about to go to Juvenile detention once again, instead she manage to get me into a place called the, Buckeye Ranch.   \n\n\nA place for trouble kids to stay long term to see professionals for help and therapy. First day there, they cut the ankle monitor off. I stayed for about a year. There I learned to improve on my social skills and other things. I was taking my medication and making some strides. My behavior was improving. Because of the lack of abuse, I was happier. Not as happy as in Florida but never the less I felt safe and secure. I still caused trouble but, the stealing has stopped and I stopped smoking. I learn to grow plants, and take care of horses, and how to find a career.  \n\n\nI let out my feelings a lot more. A lot of pent up rage and sadness was in me. Later, time to time I get to visit home on the weekends before I had to return.  \n\n\nWhen I return I was 17, and my parents bought a house during my stay at the Buckeye Ranch. They promise not to hurt me anymore and things will be better. Boy was that a big lie.  \n\n\nAgain the beatings did return and my father had to use more force as I was a bigger guy by then. Also, I drew a lot. And in Islam, drawing people and animals is prohibited. My father would find my drawings and burn them in front of me. So much art I had was lost. So, I kept them hidden. In my room's vent. The vent grill was coming out the floor and was not bolted down. Do I hid my drawings... and some naughty material in there..... What? I was a young man still going through puberty! Sue me!  \n\n\nMy father had no idea. He would raid my room invading my private area randomly to search for things but never he looked in the vent. Then I would keep my drawings in a binder, in plastic sheets to protect them. I almost always leave that binder in my school locker.  \n\n\nThe house was in Hilliard, Ohio and I went to Darby High School. I realize I was also bisexual around this time. I met my first guy crush there and he liked me back. He given me a necklace of a arrow head and a wolf to show his fodness for me.. My father found this necklace and thought it was offensive to Islam and took it away from me. He later admitted he took it with him on his long haul drives in his truck and threw it out the window somewhere in Indiana. I was devastated. It pissed me off to no end. Another chip on my shoulder I will never forgive him for.  \n\n\nI wanted to learn how to break dance, and I joined a club for that. My father did not approve and wanted me home on time. I defied his orders staying late at school to do activities. I wanted to do something with my life and in a more productive fashion! My stealing days was long behind me. Oh this did not set well with him.  \n\n\nSurprisingly, the day I came out the closet he did not do anything to me. I think the shock was too much for my father to do anything. Instead he tried to talk to me about it. It felt awkward. Strange. To be honest. I was expecting to be buried alive. That was short lived as my father would call me a faggot and other demeaning names cause of my sexuality.   \n\n\nI was a couple of months from my 18th birthday, and on this day was another event that turned me differently. I was practicing break dancing at school with my brothers (close friends at this point) and I called my mother to pick me up as usual. However my father was home early and she said he is coming to pick me up. I did not want to deal with my father because I know he will never approve of me staying after school and lecture me and smack me around. Instead I decided to walk home.   \n\n\nWhen I got home I wanted to just go upstairs and be in my room. No as soon the door closes my father attacked me. He punched me to the floor and dragged me across the hallway into the living room by my hair. He started to wail at me with his fists. He beat me until he was out of breath. He sent me upstairs, no dinner and after crying for a good hour, I slept it off. Next morning I ran away from home.   \n\n\nAnother friend heard the news and told me he knows a family I can stay with a little bit until I turn 18. I took the chance. And for privacy I will say the husband is J and the mother is K. They had three children. Two twins and a young baby that was approaching toddler hood. They had a older daughter near my age we will name her R, who I thought was nice but was a bitch to me.  \n\n\nI took care of the young kids as payment for my stay. Fed them. Babysit. Put them to bed. I had to be careful though as they had a head lice problem and I was letting my hair grow out. I would comb and take care of my hair and check for any signs of lice in my hair. I did get infected with head lice only once and because I caught it early I was able to treat it right away. I was that careful. J kept his hair short as possible, so he can spend time with his girls without worry. The day when I turned 18.... I was free from abuse....   \n\n\nOh I was so wrong on so many levels.  \n\n\nLiving with J and K for awhile... about 6-8 months. I found a guy I liked online that lived in Dayton, Ohio. I went to go live with him and he WAS AN A$$HOLE!... The f%$#er forced sex on me a lot! Even when I was sick as a dog with the flu, he forced me! What is worse... he got another guy and tried to have a three way. This new challenger was even a bigger asshole... but you know what they say about guys with small dicks beings an asshole? It is very true with this new guy. My thumb is bigger than his \"you know what!\"  \n\n\nOne day I had enough. Boyfriend tried to force his way on me, and tried hitting me. I upper cut him in the solar plexus and told him \"No!\" which made him cry like a little girl as he heaves in pain. Then I dumped him there. When he realize I wasn't going anywhere and I will fight back, he moved out. Leaving me with small dingle dong man.\n\nAlso the Landlord was gay with a boyfriend and they were Zoophiles. I walked in one day on him and his boyfriend having sex with a dog! It's. Still. Burned. Into. My. Brain. To. This. Day. God. Help. Me.   \n\n\nAlso it was hard for me to land a job too. So I helped by looking after their dog and some other chores. Whatever... I needed a roof. One day the dog got loose when I went outside to do some yard work to earn my keep. The landlord came home and got furious. He started beating me up on the porch for everyone to see! Which later got him arrested.  \n\n\nHis boyfriend got arrested too for harassing the police.\n\n  \nHis mother later came to kick me out. A friend was helping me pack my things. We told her what her son (the landlord) has been doing with animals and she refused to believe it. Oh well...   \n\n\nI had a friend's mother come pick me up and take me back to Columbus, Ohio where I again lived with my parents. My father was sorry for everything and bought me new clothes and a cell phone. Because Social Media was becoming a thing around this time I had a lot of online friends. Two weeks living with my parents I was stupid to post my new number online and day and night I got texts. So 4 am I woke up to text chimes and I get up to go online to make a post to my friends not to text me on such and such hours.   \n\n\nThen my dad walked in. I am on a computer.... 4 am.... doing nothing wrong.... Yet he lost it. He went from 0 to psycho very fast. He grabs the keyboard and pulls it away from me so hard the cable snapped before my eyes. Time seem to slow down for me there as I witness this keyboard cord just snaps in front of me.  \n\n\nThen we had a shouting match. I realize... \"He is not trying to hit me. Oh yeah! I am 18!\" So I decided to shout back and we got into our first shouting match. He told me to get the F&amp;@% out and never come back or else he'll call the police. I packed up my things and left him, calling him all sorts of obscenities. It felt gooooood. I was in tears but it felt good at the same time.  \n\n\nI stayed with a friend, until I manage to get a hold of some people I can stay with in Saint Louis, Missouri. They took me in, and lets just say.... their house.... should have been condemned as unlivable by the city ages ago. I am not joking. The basement floods, the house is falling apart. Bugs everywhere. Oh and they let a crazy cat lady live with them with dozens of cats and they were infested with fleas!   \n\n\nSummer is approaching and I am close to the age of 19. Then I met this man who later becomes the love of my life I am still with today. We dated and he shown me kindness and love. Honestly I wasn't use to this. I thought he was trying to butter me up and let my guard down. Sometimes in my head I am like \"Okay what does he really want? There has to be something. This is not normal for this to happen to me.\" But, trust came slowly and I learned to love.   \n\n\nAs for the situation I was in that time. I had a minimum paying job that barely covered my part of rent. I was behind. I need new shoes badly as I did not have a car or a bike. So everywhere I go was with my own two feet. When I bought new shoes and my own watch for the first time I earned with my money, she flipping lost it. I tried showing her my old shoes are falling apart. I had them for about 2 years give or take. No she wasn't having any of that. She kicked me out.  \n\n\nAround this time I was having a infection grow under my right armpit. It was getting bigger and bigger each day and turning all sorts of shades of red, blue and purple.   \n\n\nAlso funny enough, the house I was kicked out of was **condemned by the city three months later and everyone in that place had to move out.** \n\n  \nAfter I got kicked out. My boyfriend got me to stay with a friend who was cool. He was out in Saint Charles, Missouri. Few months later we got our own home. We live together and happily.  \n\n\nHowever, my father would not let go of me in his clutches. My siblings would find me on social media and beg me to talk to him. I would cave and call and my father would try to guilt trip me into coming home. I would reject his offer and again would go from 0 to psycho that we have a shouting match over the phone. This would happen every two to three months as I tried my best to avoid talking to my family. Each time we talk, he would beckon me to come home and make many promises. When I reject he would mentally and verbally abuse me.  \n\n\nAge 24, my father really hit me in the heart. We got into another fight when I refuse to come home when I am already home with a man I love and treats me well. He knows I like guys and he used that against me with homophobic talk. Calling me all sorts of homophobic names. He finished it off with \"I HOPE YOU GET AIDS AND DIE!\"  \n\n\nNext two days it really impacted me. I felt shattered. This would go on and on. I would talk to him trying to set boundaries but he kept crossing them.   \n\n\nAlso age 24 I got my first car. Even my father was critical, and verbally abusive. He told me I should have given him the money and he will find me a nice car. Now at this point in my life I knew something was amidst. He could have put the car under his name with mine and used it against me to come home. Nope. Not falling for it.  \n\n\nAlso I denounced being a Muslim as I want to follow my own path in spirituality. My father and mother do not know this. I know they will both flip out. I tend to keep them in the dark about this.    \n\n\nAge 27, totaled said car in very bad and wet conditions. Got good insurance money out of it, and put it as a down payment for a Nissan 350Z. Again my father became critical saying I am too stupid to drive something that has so much horse power. Still have the Z to this day.  \n\n\n**Also I was not being treated for my depression, and over the years I had no clue I was a ticking time bomb...**  \n\n\n About 3 years ago, I had a mental break down. My depression got suddenly worse. Depression can not only make one suicidal but also homicidal too. That is what happen to me. I was terrified as I felt extremely suicidal and homicidal. It was not for attention. I felt it like the way I was starving for food or thirsty for water. I wanted to. The urges were powerful. I realize something is very wrong with me. I ask my spouse to hide my handgun. He did at his company he owned. Locked and hidden.  \n\n\nAlso his company is protected by fencing and cameras and alarms. So I know there is no way I can find them in case I become more of a basket case.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI thought it was a phase and I tried to wade it out for 4 days. When I realize I wasn't going to win, I turn myself into the E.R and got into a mental ward. I felt shattered, broken, as if my true kind self is going to fade into the abyss forever.  \n\n\nThe next 7 days they concluded I suffered PTSD, major depression and possibly boarderline personality disorder from my past of being abused badly. I was evaluated by 4 psychiatrist. A leader and three students. You know its bad when a psychiatrist (The leader) says \"Because of your past Mr. \\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*, its not surprising you feel homicidal.\" I was taken back by this. Took me a moment to accept that... yeah it is possible I was feeling this way because of all the harsh abuse I've been through.   \n\n\nAlso it did not help I turned myself in at the start of OCTOBER and people were watching HORROR FILMS with blood and people stabbing other people at that ward.  \n\n\nAfter I got out, I started to see a psychiatrist and take therapy for my BPD. I am taking a a pill to help with my symptoms and I am back to normal... mostly. Still get the urges to maim someone or jump off a building but its very much controllable.   \n\n\nThen my father called, and we get into yet another fight... I had it with him trying to guilt trip me home. When he got angry that I refuse to come home I stopped him. \"I know why you are pissed I wouldn't come home! I left you like your father did!\" And hung up the phone.  \n\n\nI mean it is true. His father bailed out on him shortly after he was born.   \n\n\nAnd here is the crazy part. Someone pinch me to make sure I am not dreaming. After that when we talked, he started to respect my boundaries and became more understanding. We do not fight any longer. I told him what I told you reader about my mental breakdown and he feels fully responsible for it. He even brought up Florida. He mentioned he noticed my sister and I were very happy to be there. We were healthier and flourishing. He mention regretting moving from there.   \n\n\nReader, to me this is very strange. I am not sure if its old age or something with my old man. I am 32 and going to be 33 this summer. There is a little peace and a hint of solace in knowing my father realizes the damage he has done to me. Still, somethings he did I can never forgive him for. I know I given him WAY more chances he deserves. I still do not trust him at all, and I am keeping very cautious. I do however have slight optimism that he maybe changing just a little for the better.  \n\n\nAh reader, my journey has been hell, but I am happy. Still with the man I fell in love with when I was 19. I have my own car, and trying to open my own small business thanks to the enormous help from my spouse.   \n\n\nTo be honest, I want to cut all connections to my father. I want nothing to do with him anymore. Reader, what do you think about all this?", "subreddit": "abuse"}

So I decided to make it in to my own post.  Rape warning.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy Nex had a super weird relationship to sex. Looking back, he seemed to be ashamed of the things he liked sexually. Like he felt this need to keep it secret, but still get it. So he wouldn't communicate to me about his sexual references, wishes or expectations. So that I could know, so we could discuss it, so I could set my bounderies. He pretended to have a pretty normal drive, and that he didn't like anything too extreme. But I shortly noticed that he seemed to have a poop and anal fixation. An unhealthy relationship to porn, maby an addiction. But he never let me in on any of it, it just started creeping up the longer we were together. He was absolutely determined to get anal sex. I absolutely refused. My vagina or nothing, end of story. It's a deal breaker. But since he was a narc, breaking up was not an option. He started trying to get it by making it seem like an accident, he almost got in there so many times that I was scared to have sex, and during sex my biggest focus was on avoidng anal r\\*pe. (He eventualy succeeded, btw.) He also kept pressuaring me to use a butt plug. At one point he even used the excuse, 'if you put a butt plug in, then you don't have to worry about an accident.' So he wanted to fix the problem, by adding another problem. (Because he was well aware of the problem and my fear.  I started crying during sex two times, becasue he almost got in. It only anoyed him.) I stood my ground and refused. He even bought a butt plug without telling me. Then when he had it, he tried to convince me to use it. He kept telling me 'it's okey. It's tiny. See.' Holding it up to my face. I kept refusing. He then suggested to make it even smaller, and took out a damn knife and cutting board, to cut the thing shorter. At one point I lost it and said with anger 'what is it about NO, that you don't understand?' Then, finally, after about half an hour of constant nagging, he gave up and gave me the silent treatment.

I kept trying to explain there was a stupid precipitating incident but what was really bothering me was something deeper but he kept harping on this surface level thing instead of paying attention to anything else I tried to say in the conversation. Isn't it common knowledge that couples end up fighting about things like the dishwasher but it isn't actually the dishwasher that is the problem, it's getting at something else? At least in previous arguments when he was arguing with me and refusing to see my point of view, I think it was completely obvious I had a point and wasn't being petty/dramatic/irrational, etc. For instance, previously we fought about things like him all but ignoring me on my birthday and me wanting him to get an STI test in the context of us being in an open relationship and having unprotected sex. At least then when he was telling me I was wrong, I think he must have known on some level I was standing up for myself about reasonable, significant things. I feel really bad that he only saw the surface level thing we were arguing about...if it were just about that then, yeah, I guess I was kind of unreasonable and feel embarrassed about that...but I kept trying to get at the deeper thing that was bothering me and he just didn't get it at all.

Every night we would talk for hours. 3,5,7. We connected in every way. We knew everything about each other. We loved to laugh. We loved to just sit in silence.

Connecting. \n\nI was everything you wanted me to be, and yet never enough for you. I was always being punished for being \u201ctoo much\u201d until it just became too much. You threw me under the bus when I needed you the most. Every time you had the opportunity to show me kindness, you showed me the back of your hand, every time I would leave a door cracked for you, you would slam one in my face. \n\n\nI would fantasize about hurting you and watching you get what you deserved. I would fantasize exposing your true self to your wife and those closest to you. I fantasized of walking away and letting you ruin your life on your own. But when it came down to it, I stayed. I listened. I supported you. And when your wife found out you were talking to me every day, I had your back. I said it was my fault. I took the fall for you. When you told her I was crazy, I said do whatever you have to do to save your marriage and keep your family. \n\nI suffered in silence. I fell on the blade. You stabbed me in the back and then I chose to take a bullet for you. You told me I ruined your life. You blamed me for every lie I caught you in. You blamed me for every time you hurt me. You blamed me for being human. For existing. For feeling. I blamed myself for seeing you and talking to you anyway. \nFor letting you hurt me, for believing you cared. I blame myself. You blame me. She blames me. \n\nI fight your voice in my head tearing me down every single day. My life is broken. My heart is broken. I have been in survival mode for months.

I hope it brakes you. And even as I type those things I know they\u2019re not my truth. I hope you get better. I hope you get help. I hope you become a better person, husband, father. After everything you did to me, I still feel sick at the thought of your pain. I still feel responsible in some way for not helping you more. \n\nI want to hate you. You deserve hate. You treat people like objects, you always have to be on top and in control and somehow you always get exactly what you want. I thought I was the exception. I thought bc I saw you as you truly were, you would love me more. You would do the same. You would never leave. You would have my back. You would always be here for me. \nI was so wrong. But that\u2019s ok. Karma gets us all. I trust that. And the next time you need me, you will see what you did. You will see what it feels like to be without me on your side. \n\nI will always love you. But I will never let you close enough to hurt me again. I will love you from far far away.

I cleaned the house, did all the chores, had a full-time job, cared for the animals, took care of our son, etc. And I was alone the majority of the time because he was/is some hotshot bartender in a big city. There were many points in our relationship in which I had had enough of being the only one taking care of things and he would hire a maid instead of pitching in. His thought process was, \"Well, I make more money than you so you should be the one to do all those things.\" \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhen our son was born, it became even more difficult to take care of everything. And then he worked more and more and used that as the excuse for not being home. His job, and his mistress, were eventually what led to the demise of our marriage. Although he is always quick to blame me for ALL of it. \"You drove me to her. You wouldn't talk to me about work. She did.\" BECAUSE THEY WORKED TOGETHER. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe separated in December 2017 (a year after our son was born), I filed for divorce in March of 2018 (after coming to the house and seeing that it was as if a meth head lived there - it was THAT disgusting), and the divorce was finalized in October of 2018. The next month my suspicions of a mistress were confirmed - even though people had been telling me that they saw something going on for over a year.  I now have an amazing boyfriend who actually cleans without me asking, he is mentally and emotionally healthy, and is just an all around decent human being. And NOW my ex-husband is playing the victim card. A card that I never played.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHe started off with \"Man, it is hard to take care of our son alone.\" His mistress left him. Again. So he is alone. Completely for the first time ever.  And I won't react. I just say, \"Yup, I feel ya.\" When all I want to say is, \"You think? I have been fucking doing it since he was born, you asshole! You are just NOW realizing this?\"  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHe continues to drop little bombs about how hard it is to do it all alone.  I don't react. I just say, \"It sure is.\" \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nToday he posts on his Insta bragging about the fact that he cooked, he did laundry, he vacuumed, he mopped, and he took care of our son and used the hashtag #singleparenting. He wants people to recognize how hard he is working. Well, congradufuckinglations! You did what a basic human being should be doing. Oh? And you are a single parent...two-ish days a week? I am a parent 365 days a year regardless of when my son is with me or not. I make the doctor and dentist appointments, I chose his daycare, I make sure his diapers are there when he needs them, I am working with the school on potty training, I am working on which elementary school he needs to go to, I am making sure his life is as stable as possible while you are busy galavanting around the city drinking and being the talk of the town. Go fuck yourself and your victimhood. You never saw me playing that card! Why? Because I never needed validation or praise for being a good mother (which you tell me that I am not) and being a decent human being. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI suspect this is happening because he is seeing how happy I am with my new life and how wonderful my boyfriend is to me and to my son. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI am just waiting for the moment when he is fed up and starts becoming even more of the victim and yelling at me about it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAll I want to say is FUCK YOU.

More recently though I dated someone for a few months who I believe exhibits the purest form of narcissism I\u2019ve ever experienced. There were many warning signs, but the final straw came when he got upset with me because I wouldn\u2019t agree to forgo my desire to have children for him. According to him, I was in the wrong (something all his friends would agree with) for being unwilling to sacrifice my desire for children for him. I was very confused because he\u2019d told me he wanted children and was suddenly declaring he did not want them. Later he tried to explain his actions by telling me he had had a breakdown, then told me he did in fact want children and had always wanted children. He did not know why he had said he didn\u2019t. \n\nWell I know why. Because he\u2019s a narcissist and is deeply insecure and need to prove to himself that I didn\u2019t love him enough so he chose the thing that was most important to me and forced me into a scenario where unless I agreed to give up that thing, I was a bad person who would never love him enough. \n\nI though maybe this is redeemable but lost all hope when he rationalized his behavior as a reaction to the heavy topic of having kids\u2014something we hadn\u2019t been discussing. He refused to acknowledge that what he had done was try to test me, that it was manipulative and wrong. I can say now after reflection that diversion was a typical way he avoided acknowledging his manipulative and emotionally abusive behaviors.\n\nI apologize for ranting and not getting to my point. I\u2019m still in the FOG. His behaviors provoked a lot of behaviors in me I am not proud of. I mirrored his behaviors in ways after I grew tired of trying to reason with him. Had I recognized the narcissism at that point I could have avoided the mistake. \n\nNow as I reflect I am really not proud of how I acted. I want to acknowledge my part and apologize but I know the general sentiment is that apologies just give them fuel. I just feel really disappointed in myself and want to make it right with me, but I don\u2019t know how other than the apology route.\n\nNow I\u2019m also fearing I am a narcissist because I keep winding up with people who have these traits. Am I truly just projecting? Am I the monster? Or am I just getting down on myself right now because my self worth has been eroded. Has anyone else had these thoughts and fears?\n\nTl;dr My narcissist wore me down and i started acting like a narcissist to survive and I\u2019m ashamed of myself and don\u2019t know how to make it right.

Literally 2 days ago I realised. \n\nI'm not even sure where to start. So the N in my life was someone that I thought was a friend. Definitely an N of the covert type. I even went as far as to try to start a business with this person. They were also my housemate so we had a lot of contact. I lived with him for about 8 months while also grieving the loss of my mum. And therein lies the problem.\n\nI attributed the brain fog, the adrenal fatigue, 3 to 4 panic attacks a week and the constant walking on eggshells as some ambiguous part of the grieving process. I became extremely depressed and contemplated taking my own life, to the point where I was acting it out in my head every day.\n\nIt was definitely clear that I was in a terrible place to my other housemates, but every time I wanted to open up and maybe talk about it it was met with resentment from the N, I can only assume its because grieving the loss of a parent makes his problems seem trivial (we're early to mid 20s btw) so every time I tried to open up and talk I was shamed for it. \n\nAlso any time I was happy I was shamed for that too so it kept me in this lonely grieving state of isolation where I wasn't allowed to be happy, and ultimately prevented me dealing with the loss in a healthy way.\n\nThis went on for about 5 months until I had the sense to move out after seriously considering suicide which I should add, I've NEVER had those kinds of thoughts before in my life. I didn't discuss it, I just got it sorted then told my housemates that's what I was doing. I've been no contact now for about 4 months and I'm starting to heal but I still have that feeling of shame whenever I want to share my good mood with anyone, or tell a joke, or lead a conversation.\n\nThe reason this was all triggered in me was because on mothers day, I lit some candles around a photo of my mum to honour her memory, and spent the day thinking about her. And it was so joyous! It made me realise that it wasn't the grief making me feel guilty and ashamed of myself all the time.\n\nIf you've read this far then thank you so much! It honestly means the world to me to be able to share this. (I cried a few time while typing this out).\n\nAside from needing to put this all in writing and share it I need advice. I'm in a place now where the N isn't in my life anymore and from what I can tell they've moved on, but I feel like something is missing in me now, some inherent self love or some pride about my character feels as if its been stolen. I know I can't get it back from them, but that begs the question, how DO I get it back?\n\nI'm in the gym everyday and mostly trying to look after myself, but I still have pretty bad social anxiety. It's not something I've ever really had before so I'm at a loss.\n\nAny comments would be appreciated. Thanks again so much for reading, I know it's a wall of text. There's tears running down my face, I feel as if I've poured my soul out in this post.\n\nMuch love and I wish you all the best. ", "subreddit": "NarcissisticAbuse"}

I suppose I'm still seeking validation.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n1. Very early on in our relationship she lied about having polycystic ovaries in order to get pregnant. Henceforth she lied constantly in the form of comically exaggerated stories. It became a standing joke that I\u2019d let her finish an anecdote and then tell her amused audience: \u2018now I\u2019ll give you the real version of what happened\u2026\u2019 it was funny at the time. Eventually I discovered that she\u2019d been living a secret life of lies and affairs for many years.\n2. Initially she mirrored me: when we met she seemed to have exactly the same musical and cinema tastes as me, despite being 9 years younger. Later, she developed a completely new set of musical tastes that were in line with her new set of younger friends.\n3. She used triangulation: in her case the third party was a phone which she stared at constantly, ignoring me completely. Hundreds of photographs exist of her staring lovingly at her phone. When challenged about this I would be made to feel that it was me who had the problem. Later she would lie in bed telling me about all the men who had 'hit' on her at clubs.\n4. She was occasionally violent. In a night club last year she grabbed a man by the throat and head-butted him!\n5. After our daughter was born she went back to work as soon as possible. For the next 15 years I became the main carer. Her main parental input was to constantly undermine me in front of Sofia.\n6. It was impossible to win an argument with her. She was very cool, articulate and extremely nasty. She would constantly use phrases such as \u2018you\u2019re too sensitive\u2019, \u2018you\u2019re depressed\u2019, \u2018you\u2019re over-reacting,\u2019you\u2019re being ridiculous\u2019, \u2018you\u2019re vile\u2019. She would never allow me to speak, constantly talking over me to the point where my frustration would turn to anger.\n7. Life was dominated by her mood swings. One day she would completely ignore me and act as though I had done something wrong, the next day I would be smothered in love.\n8. She very rarely cooked. When she did so it was usually a ready meal. \n9. She never read a book.\n10. She never bought a CD or record or DVD.\n11. She is incredibly charming. She is the life and soul of the party and easily attracts male and female admirers. However, she has very few real friends. In our 17 years together she was visited by long-term friends on only one occasion.\n12. She is obsessed with her appearance. She never left the house without full make-up. She is also obsessed with mirrors, which are everywhere throughout the house.\n13. She is very grandiose, always eating at the most expensive restaurants and spending a fortune on designer clothes and shoes.\n14. She cannot control her spending. Every day packages would arrive at the house for her. Despite earning a six-figure salary she has no savings and her money usually ran out with a couple of weeks to go until payday.\n15. Very early on in our relationship she began isolating me from my friends and family, usually by verbally attacking them. When I later brought this up with her she admitted that she had \u2018no idea\u2019 why she did this.\n16. She was incredibly controlling, choosing where we went on holiday, where we ate. Practically every aspect of our life.\n17. She manipulated me into a position in which I was financially dependant on her. There was never any acknowledgement of the amount of time I spent on rearing our daughter. This was my unspoken duty.\n18. She was incredibly lacking in empathy. Whenever I was ill and didn\u2019t feel able to go to work her stock response was: \u2018You\u2019re well enough to walk, aren\u2019t you?\u2019.\n19. She showed zero remorse when I discovered she had been having affairs for at least three years. Within three days she turned to me and said: \u2018you\u2019re not going to start crying again are you?\u2019. Only 24 hours after bidding me a tearful goodbye she took her new lover to Brighton to meet her parents and our daughter.\n20. Without my ever realising it, she successfully ensured that my entire life was fitted around hers. I gave up my career for ten years and took a job I hated in order that I could attend to child-minding.\n21. She brought drugs into the house and then complained that I took too many.\n22. When I discovered her infidelity She quickly moved to turn mutual friends against me, telling them I was a \u2018scrounger\u2019 and a \u2018leech\u2019. She also turned her family against me, telling them I had been \u2018abusing\u2019 her.\n23. She is very impulsive. One of her stock phrases is: \u2018You know me, I live in the moment.\u2019\n24. She is very easily bored. We had to be constantly doing something or going somewhere. \n25. After the first couple of years together she began rejecting my sexual advances. When we did have sex it was only when she wanted it. This is how it was for the majority of our relationship. \n26. She very rarely kissed me. She told me she didn\u2019t like it. \n27. Whenever anybody crossed or fell out with her in the workplace their eventual fate was that they\u2019d lose their job. I used to joke with her about this, saying: \u2018I\u2019d never cross you!\u2019.\n28. If ever there were redundancies at work she was was often the one\u2019 called in to do the dirty work. She had no problem at all sacking people. \n29. She rarely showed emotion, although weirdly she would often cry while watching a movie. \n30. Her general knowledge was superficial. So often I would hear her repeating things that I had told her to other people, invariably word for word. \n31. She never acknowledged any of my personal achievements. She never read any of the books or magazine articles that I had written. \n32. She constantly told me I was the \u2018love of her life\u2019. Later I discovered she had been saying exactly the same thing to her secret lover, although she denied this when challenged. \n33. She told me that her lover was \u2018in love with her for the first time\u2019. She then told me that she \u2018didn\u2019t love anyone\u2019.\n34. When I finally discovered her lies and cheating I was instantly discarded, as if 17 years together and a child meant nothing whatsoever to her. \n35. She once told me that in school she pretended she had a famous older brother and perpetuated the lie for years. \n36. She admitted to watching porn on her computer while I was in the same room watching TV!", "subreddit": "NarcissisticAbuse"}

My memory of a lot of this is really bad.\n\nIt all started in 6th grade. Going into middle school, I got separated from most of my old friends. I was pretty introverted as a kid, so I didn't really mind. But it worried my mom that my friend group was getting smaller and smaller, so I  became really self conscious. \n\nThat's when my friend, we'll call her C, came into my life. \n\nAt first it was great. I loved having a friend that I felt understood me. We were great friends for about a year after that. It wasn't until the beginning of 7th grade that things got rocky. She started treating me really badly. Constantly insulting me, yelling at me to shut up when I tried to talk to her, saying things she knew would hurt me just for laughs. Whenever I brought up that what she was doing hurt me, she said it was just me being overly sensitive, and I needed to 'grow a backbone.' \n\nOne thing to know about C is she was very tempermental, to say the least. She used to get into fights with EVERYONE. And she didn't take it lightly either, she would often message me in the middle of the night to rant about some dumb argument she had. I knew this, so I avoided conflict at all costs. Even if it meant putting up with her cruel behavior towards me.\n\nBut one day, we were talking in a group chat we had with some other people. I don't entirely remember what happened, but she got mad at me and left the chat. I messaged her and asked what was up, and she just started tearing me to pieces. So I fought back. I was so tired of her constant bullshit. And that was all it took, she said she didn't wanna be friends with me anymore.\n\nThis part is kinda pathetic on my part, but I BEGGED her not to do that. In a fucked up way, I still liked her. And I didn't wanna be the reason stuff got fucked up.\n\nThen she said she had been planning on not being friends with me for awhile, and just didn't have the balls to say it. This destroyed me. I felt like all the shit I had been through, all the fighting I did to be satisfactory to her was all for nothing. After that, our friendship ended. Later on I was diagnosed with PTSD because of what happened.\n\nWe ended up making up two different times after that, but this is already really long, so I'll skip all that.\n\nFast forward to today, the sole reason I'm talking about this right now. \n\nI logged onto my facebook for the first time in years. I quickly realized I had never unfriended C on there. Curiosity got the best of me, and I decided to see where she had ended up. After scrolling through tons of selfies and public family drama, I found a bunch of posts in the vein of \"Believe abuse survivors! Fuck abusers!\"\n\nI felt like she had just walked up to me and spit in my face. \n\nI had endured all her bullshit, ended up with tons of issues and years of therapy, only for her to walk away unscathed.

He\u2019s out of the country. It\u2019s dangerous where he is. In fact, THIS very email was interrupted by violence going on around me! (Don\u2019t you worry though, I\u2019m fine!) The bank freezes his account sometimes, and he\u2019s asleep when the bank is open in our country, and sleep is hard to get so he can\u2019t just stay up late and unfreeze things. My job is very very important and hard. The internet goes out a lot. It\u2019s very dangerous and remote and I\u2019m very far far away!

He said he\u2019s responsible! But not one single thing in his email admits an ounce of responsibility. It\u2019s excuse after excuse. This payment has been ongoing for over two years and is due on the same day every month. He could be in a tent in Antarctica being attacked by savage bears and this payment should be set up to reach me, as it is legally mandated. I\u2019m even supposed to be in his will in case something happens to him (his job is actually dangerous, he just loves to really play that up way more than it is). Automatic transfers. Not hard. For an alleged genius, he sure messes up a very simple thing frequently. \n\nOn top of the gaslighting, he\u2019s playing the victim like a champion, and continues with the delusion that a single member of my family gives one f\u2019s sake about his safety at this point after he nearly killed me. If you\u2019re doubting it was/is that bad with your NEX-it was/is. This served as a great reminder to me not to doubt what abuse I endured. They are masters at this. Insidious is the perfect word for them. Proceeding in a gradual, subtle way, but with harmful effects. \n\nYou\u2019re not the crazy one. This email could be in a textbook about narcissism.

He knows that I am uncomfortable with him sleeping at my place, as my roommate who is also a good friend of mine minds, so if we sleep together it is at his place. That being said, once he falls asleep he rarely wakes up on his own. Also: he has been emotionally abusive/manipulative in the past.\n\nOne night when he had been doing homework at my place, he decided to \"take a rest\" (i.e. sleep), at around 11 pm, on the floor. I had reminded him before hand that he could rest here, but I would need him to go back to sleep, no spending the night here. He said fine. When the clock rolled around to about 1 am and I had finished my homework, I went over to wake him up (he had been asleep the entire time). He is not easy to wake up. If you kind of wake him up, and he says he will get up soon but doesn't move, that means he is going to sleep till morning--as I learned through much experience. So, I kept at it until he actually got up. Problem is, when he did get up, he was BOILING MAD, he was mad that I kept asking him to get up, he felt like I was trying to drive him out of my apartment and that I didn't care about him or respect him. And he left, mad and insulting me all the way. And then, I did something stupid: I followed, apologizing. I realize that I instead should have given him room. Ah, well, hindsight is always 20/20, right? So, without saying anything about wanting some space prior to this, he flips around and says that he \"wouldn't open the door for me even if I froze to death outside\" (it was winter). And charged back to his apartment. At least at that point I stopped following him.\n\nLater he apologized and said he was overreacting because he was mad at me not letting him spend the night at my place since he was asleep already.\n\nRecently it came up again. He was saying that it was the actions that mattered, not the words--in otherwords, even if he said hurtful things, its not so bad because he wouldn't have ACTUALLY acted on them (as in here, he wouldn't have actually let me freeze to death). I argued that even if you would not have acted on them, those words are very hurtful. His response? \"Well, I only said them to you because I wanted you to stop following me. And it worked, didn't it?\"\n\nI wasn't quite sure how to respond to that.\n\nI guess I am just wondering, in this particular instance, was it actually my fault at least to some degree because I should have given him space? Was his behavior emotionally abusive? Is this normal as happening sometimes even in mostly healthy relationships?", "subreddit": "emotionalabuse"}

I am ecstatic to acclimate to the \"boring\" feeling. Not that it's boring in the least with him, but that's how we survivors seem to describe it after the spikes and abysses on Planet Narco.

He speaks and writes clearly how he feels, good/bad/otherwise, and I try hard to do so too.

It is absolutely amazing...\n\n...which taps into the aforementioned addiction. I had an intense week this week w/ some health things and was sucked into a 2-day long emotional flashback.

We're long distance about 30% of the time. \n\nFor anyone going through a devaluation or discard period allow me to explain what they're up while they're ignoring you.  \n\n3 weeks ago he started getting super weird on me.  Was rapidly flipflopping back and forth between uncertainty about our future to how much love he has for me.  His text habits got super bizarre.  He started triangulating me with a woman in Toronto that he said he had met through work and hung out with and that she seemed like his type, etc etc.  \n\nDuring the devaluation I downloaded this tracker app that gave me super detailed info about his whatsapp activity.  All it does is alert me when he's online and offline and keeps a log of it for every day.  For the first couple days that I downloaded it, he was only on whatsapp speak to me.  Nothing super weird.  It seemed he basically only used Whatsapp to speak to me for a while.\n\nWe ended up getting into a pretty big argument a week ago where I pretty much had it and I pulled the rug out from under him.  I told him to his face I think he has a personality disorder, nothing has changed in 2 years, he hasn't evolved or grown up and I think he has major issues.\n\n**Predictably he immediately started ignoring my existence.  Just completely ghosted me.   And within *minutes* he started checking into Whatsapp CONSTANTLY.  It literally went from 0 to 100.** I'm sure it's the woman he was triangulating me with in Toronto.  He must've stopped talking with her at some point and as soon as we had it out, he ran and hoovered her as fast as he could.\n\nI was fascinated at how well this app worked and how much insight I was able to get into his psyche from such simple data, so I continued watching his activity over the next week.  Guys, whoever he was loveboming was getting it full force.  He was on constantly throughout the day, sometimes in the chat window for hours at a time and then other times checking in every 20 seconds  to  (I imagine) see if he had received a response from this mystery woman.  And he'd be up all night constantly on the app.  \n\nAgain, this all went from practically no activity in the weeks before our argument, to 23 hours of activity immediately after our argument.  So much for being so busy at work, he hadn't put his phone down in practically 4 days straight! Whoever he was talking to, he was completely obsessive!!!\n\nThen, BOOM, yesterday, something changed on his end.  He kept checking the app every 20 seconds for only 5-6 seconds at a time (waiting for a response) with longer gaps in between.  The durations of keeping the app open shrank drastically.  It seems he came on too strong and she got spooked and now he's obsessively waiting and checking and trying to revive the endless convo he had going with her.\n\nIt's pretty f'n nuts how hard he dove headfirst into someone else as soon as I ended it with him.  Almost like a panic move, like his LIFE depended on it.  And his habits on the app, he literally never puts his phone down, he is just checking, checking, checking it all day long, every minute or so waiting for this person to reply.\n\nYes, I know I have an issue and I should not be tracking his movements on the app and I will definitely be deleting this and focusing on healing, but this was an eye opener for sure!!  These people do not know how to self-soothe or deal with their issues head on and juts like I suspected, the reason he suddenly vanishes and doesn't care whenever we have a conflict is because he just buries his entire being in whoever he possibly can.  Almost like it's life or death for them!   There is no possible way he was able to get any work done in the days after our argument, that's how much he was on the app.\n\nWith that said, I will now start focusing on healing as I have no reason to be scoffing at him or calling him pathetic when I'm doing stalkerish things myself.  Although it's pretty satisfying to see how quickly he's spooked the new supply.  I've been sending her mental messages to be strong and run away, haha!", "subreddit": "NarcissisticAbuse"}

When in reality our perception was based on our own personal experiences and the lack of representation showcasing how hard and real it actually is.

By no means is this film exclusively for men- it is instead intended to be a companion piece to the enlighting of sexual abuse in our culture.  All the character's in our film were victims at one point or another- but it is how they choose to cope with their trauma that drives the story. \n\n**If you wish to hear more about our story visit the film's website and follow our progress:**\n\n[https://rosesformsjacobs.wixsite.com/film](https://rosesformsjacobs.wixsite.com/film)\n\nThank you so much for your time.\n\nDon't hesitate if you wish to express your own personal views and experiences.

Should I have asked more questions? \n\nI (M 21) live a sort of sketch apartment complex in NE Iowa. Recently, I helped a neighbor (Unknown age/gender) of a different building with a situation in our shared parking lot. They had a friend in the car that was sloshed and resistant to going in. She (maybe late 20s - 30s?) was spouting mostly nonsense, but relatively calm. \n\nMy neighbor (T) seemed annoyed with the whole situation and began to physically remove their friend (A) from the SUV. It didn't cause pain, but A was not going to go quietly. She didn't fight per se, but held onto the side of the door and said stuff about wanting to go back inside. Once T had her out and standing, they told me to lock the door. I said I didn't know how because I didn't have the keys or anything, but then figured it out and opened the passenger door and lock the whole vehicle.\n\nI was surprised that she was able to stand as well as she did. I haven't dealt with a lot of drunk people, so I thought we would basically have to carry her in. Now it was just a matter of motivating her to either sit on the walker T had brought out (I thought they needed it to walk, turns out no). I let T do the talking as they knew each other by name and seemed to be acquaintances at the minimum. T became more annoyed (but not aggravated) and started to threaten calling an ambulance. Since I had no idea if that was even necessary, I didn't know how to take that.\n\nI started to speak up and fill the gap of T wanting A to go in and A very much not wanting to. A wasn't violent and didn't even swear at me or T. I don't remember was exactly I said, but we had some back and forth about her sitting down on the walker and not going to the hospital etc. I just tried to keep it civil and speak clearly (usually a low talker), and keep on track with what A was saying. Eventually, it seemed like she decided to go in. She seemed to regain her composure and asked me if I could walk her to the door. A bottle had broken in the parking lot a couple days ago so I was concerned about the glass on the ground since she was just wearing socks, but it was in a different area so I decided it would probably be okay and simply checked where she was walking.\n\nIt was a short walk to the main door to their building. When we go there, there was some back and forth about who was holding the door, etc., but overall it went much more smoothly than other parts. There was the main door and then a hall door just a few feet in. The part that really freaked me out was when I tried to end our interaction and go about my day. I tried to do it at the hall door so I could leave. I suck at ending conversations normally anyway and I could tell she wanted me to go into the apartment with her for some reason.\n\nHowever, it must have clicked in her head that I was trying to leave because all of a sudden she started to motion me to come with her and acting confused. I said that it would be okay, that T would take care of he, and that she could sleep. Then she looked me straight in the eye and started repeating, \"It's not okay. Actually, it's not okay.\" It wasn't psychotic, but definitely freaked me out because she hadn't made a lot of eye contact up until that point. T had walked up to unlock the apartment door but started walking back when they had noticed A stopping at the hall door. Then T asked me what if/what she had been saying. I just mumbled something like I don't know or that I couldn't tell nonsense.\n\nQuestion time:\nIs this normal behavior for drunks or was it a flag that I should have paid attention to?\nShould I have established a relationship between the two or asked other questions?\nIs it probably an okay situation or should any action be taken by me/others?\nWhat others things should I have done differently?", "subreddit": "abuse"}

There are a lot of questions that they have about behaviour (e.g., affairs) that I consider inappropriate for their age (8 and 7).  I suspect that when they\u2019re old enough to piece together what is appropriate and inappropriate in relationships that they\u2019ll understand the infidelity.  My response when they ask a question that I don\u2019t think would be appropriate for their age is to say, \u201cyou\u2019ll understand when you\u2019re older.\u201d  I don\u2019t think that\u2019s a good response because they\u2019re obviously curious and not having an answer means they\u2019ll try to find one another way, which may lead to bad or incomplete information or even manipulation from the nex.  How should I respond to the difficult questions with honesty, but in a way is suitable for their age?  One of the things that hurts and worries me is that the example being set for them by the nex is contrary to my values.  Unless I\u2019m able to communicate my values to them, then the only influence they have is the example that they see.  Also, I\u2019ve anecdotally seen instances where as a child has matured and understood the dissolution of the relationship of their parents and that in that realization they\u2019ve experienced anger at the parent that was unfaithful.  Is it better to be honest all along about that sort of information so that it doesn\u2019t come as a shock when they\u2019re older and might feel betrayed by their parents?", "subreddit": "NarcissisticAbuse"}

He had a step father and step brothers for a number of years in his childhood that he rarely ever talks about so I\u2019ve often wondered if the trauma was caused by them. His parents divorced when he was still in diapers because his father was a serial cheater so perhaps the damage happened very young and he\u2019s not even aware of what happened? His mom worked a lot when he was growing up and he has mentioned sometimes he would have rather have had less growing up and instead have had her around more  (of course this was in defense of him not contributing enough financially so most likely total nonsense but...).

We had already been dating for some time by this point, and I believe I was with him for a year or so total by the time it ended.\n\nThis guy was one of the most abusive people I\u2019ve ever known, but I only knew this in retrospect. He would belittle me, flirt with other girls at our school, cheated on me, blamed me for his being angry, lied to me, pushed me, coerced me into doing things with him that I didn\u2019t want to do, told other people about private or personal things to make fun of me with his friends, showed them private photos, controlled the clothes I wore, and was generally manipulative and I ALWAYS fell for it. My friends would tell me what a piece of shit he was and I had an excuse for it. My efforts to comfort or help him were futile, he just wanted to control me because I was the only thing he control, and he wanted me to hurt more than him.\n\nWell, I\u2019m not a \u201cthing\u201d and I don\u2019t deserve to be hurt.\n\nI broke up with him while he was out of town visiting his mom. I was afraid to do it in person, and I was 16 and I just wanted him out of my life. His family from out of town came to get his things and I never saw him again.\n\n\nOne of the worst parts of this is that my parents saw what he was doing to me and they did nothing. (My family is a whole other world of issues.)\n\nWhen I told my mom he wasn\u2019t coming back, she bawled and said things like \u201che was like a son to meee\u201d or \u201che is such a good kid why would you do this\u201d and I had no audible answer - abuse was normalized to me but I just knew I wasn\u2019t happy and I was relieved to know he was gone. However, it hurt me that my parents loved him so much while they knew how he treated me, under their own roof. \n\nSometimes my mom will still bring him up, they\u2019re friends with him on Facebook, and all that. I don\u2019t miss him one bit.\n\nI found his Facebook a long time ago and he had a photo of him and his new girlfriend with her cleavage blurred out. The comments were something along the lines of \u201cthat\u2019s only for ME to see\u201d or \u201cthat\u2019s mine\u201d like she\u2019s an object that belongs to him.

My Partner of two years has never raised his voice to me, and I don't feel afraid of him, but any time I find myself in a situation with a man who displays signs of anger I lose my shit.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nDoes this ever get better?

He knows I have fears of him being a narc and he knows all of my deepest fears of what could happen in this relationship. I've been so open and vulnerable. He's been nothing but respectful and wants to see where this goes. I have no reason to believe he's interested in anyone else.\nOnly issues are the compliments. He gives me a lot of them.. and he also is starting to share in my interests such as hiking and certain Psychologists (I'm a Psych major) which I am afraid is him \"mirroring\" me.\n\nHow can I know for sure if he is one? Like what signs can I look out for over the internet. I think when he visits I'll have a better understanding of any red flags. But right now it just feels like he really likes me.

It was as if all roads in your life had been converging on this point. Every false start that you had endured, every betrayal you had suffered, everything that had ever happened to you in your miserable, unfulfilled life was merely a rehearsal. It was all leading up to this moment. \n\nAnd she was beautiful. Impossibly beautiful. And funny. And kind. And generous. And wise. You wondered what you had ever done to deserve such a rare treasure. You wallowed in her sweet aroma. You basked in her dusky body heat. You worshipped her being. In the bedroom you had never experienced such bliss, such sensory pleasures, such *togetherness*. When you talked it was as if you were one and the same person. She was perfect. And wonder upon wonder she believed that you were perfect too. She told you how handsome you were. How witty. How clever. How *special*. She wanted to find out everything about you and didn\u2019t seem remotely troubled by your more obvious imperfections. The things that had held you back all your life. The scars that stubbornly refused to heal. \n\nThis was love. You were experiencing LOVE. Real love. True love. Enraptured to be entangled in its silky net. Never in your wildest dreams could you have imagined it would ever feel as good as this. As pure. As selfless. As all-consuming. After all those years of hopelessness your life finally had meaning. This is what you had been building towards from the day that you were dragged screaming from the womb. You believed. And, incredibly, she believed, too. You were *Love Twins* carried along on the wheels of destiny. The two of you overdosed on joy. Freebased on passion. The bliss was almost palpable. You could touch it. You could smell it. You could taste it.\n\nSo you ditch your long-term partner and she ditches hers. *They never really meant anything*, you tell yourself. Because now you have the REAL THING. You get a place together and the days float past you in an opiate haze. Every waking moment, every sleeping moment is spent in her company. You talk. You eat. You laugh. You drink. You make love like never before. You plan. You plot. You scheme. The future is no longer a foreign country. How is it possible that it can feel *this* good to be alive?\n\nAnd then one day when you least expect it you hear the teeniest, weeniest alarm bell gently tinkling away in your blissed-out brain. *What\u2019s wrong*? you ask. *Is it something I\u2019ve done?* But she just sits there in a grubby dressing gown, her eyes staring blankly ahead. The lips that you long to kiss saying nothing. And suddenly you recoil against the bedroom wall. Such anger! Such rage! How can this girl, this woman, *my Love Twin*, be saying such things? The shock jolts you temporarily back to reality and the breath is squeezed from your lungs. Your world is shattered into pieces and already you would do anything to glue those broken shards back together again.\n\nIn the morning come the apologies. The tears. The explanations. Always the explanations. It\u2019s *hormones*, she tells you. *It\u2019s a medical condition*, she will say later. *It\u2019s this. It\u2019s that.* So you wrap your arms around her trembling shoulders and tell her not to worry. *We can fix this*, you say. *Together you and I can make this righ*t. And she kisses you and a smile lights up her beautiful face. The snarling, spitting stranger from yesterday now banished forever. Until the next time.\n\nThe days turn into weeks and the weeks turn into months and the months turn into years. The passage of time is immaterial so long as you have your *Love Twin*. A baby arrives. And even though you never really wanted one you pick the little girl up in your arms and you\u2019re in love all over again. Now there are three of you. Three of you against the world. You pose before the camera lens and smile. You don\u2019t deserve this. You don\u2019t deserve such happiness. Nobody does.\n\nAnd then\u2026 And then\u2026 Things begin to change. Slowly. Insidiously. Like the stationary hands of a clock you are unaware of any movement until you chance to look away. You\u2019re the same person you always were. At least, you\u2019re mostly the same person. Sure, you don\u2019t go out as much as you used to but then you have different priorities nowadays. For one thing there\u2019s a toddler to look after. To feed. To clean. To entertain. What could be more important than that? And so what if you\u2019re losing touch with your friends? And for that matter your family, too? But that\u2019s only natural, isn\u2019t it? You keep telling yourself that. (*Why does she do that strange thing? Verbally attacking the people you care about so that these days you're wary of introducing her to anybody? It must be because she loves you so much that she wants to have you all to herself. Yes, that\u2019s the reason. It\u2019s charming really. Sweet.*)\n\nAnd then one evening you catch your reflection in the mirror. You look older. Heavier. You\u2019ve put on thirty\u2026 Forty pounds and your belt strains against your flabby belly. You limp a little, too. (*You really must see a doctor about that when you have a moment\u2026)* There are dark circles under your eyes \u2013 hardly surprising given how hard it is to sleep at night. *Who\u2019d be a father, huh?!* And yes, you\u2019re a little down these days. Well a lot down actually. You know that you are. She tells you all the time that you are. But then there\u2019s so much to worry about. So much work to do. It\u2019s only natural.\n\nWhen you met your L*ove Twin* you were a writer. You even sold a few books in your time. But that\u2019s in the past. You\u2019ve put your career temporarily on hold while you attend to more important matters. And yes, you hate the job that necessity forced you to take. You really despise it if you\u2019re honest with yourself. The thought of doing it sometimes makes you feel physically sick. But you don\u2019t have a choice because there\u2019s the baby to look after. You have to be there to take her to school. And you have to be there to pick her up afterwards. It\u2019s lucky that *we* found a job with such flexible hours. *We\u2019d* have been in real trouble if *we* hadn\u2019t been able to do this. \n\nAnd every evening you wait for her to come home. She doesn\u2019t like to cook so it\u2019s best you do it. And even if your meagre efforts are often rewarded with a grimace it\u2019s not really important. You smile at her as she walks into the house. She pecks you on the cheek and frowns. She doesn\u2019t notice the aftershave that you\u2019ve doused yourself in especially for her. She\u2019s oblivious to the softness of your chin. (Naturally, you love her so much that it\u2019s become your habit to ensure that you\u2019re freshly shaved and showered for that special moment when she floats in through the door.)\n\nTo grudging appreciation you serve the food that you\u2019ve prepared. You swallow it down and it sticks in your teeth. You stack the dishwasher and put the baby to bed. Except that she\u2019s no longer a baby. She\u2019s growing up fast. Full of questions. Too many questions. *I simply don\u2019t have enough energy left to reply,* you think to yourself. So you read to her until she begins to fall asleep. And you\u2019re falling asleep too. You\u2019re falling asleep all the time.\n\nWithout ever noticing it a stranger has moved into your house. But you don\u2019t know she\u2019s a stranger. She stares at that chunk of metal and glass in her hand endlessly\u2026 Endlessly\u2026Endlessly\u2026 Tapping away like a metronome and smiling to herself and she never seems to hear you. And when she does hear you she won\u2019t let you speak. *If only she\u2019d stop interrupting me,* you groan*, I could tell her what\u2019s really on my mind*. But then\u2026 But then\u2026 You\u2019ve forgotten what it was you wanted to say. Perhaps it\u2019s just as well. It couldn\u2019t have been that important anyway. Your *Love Twin* works very hard. It\u2019s perfectly understandable if she sometimes gets frustrated and hits out at you. And even if some of the things she calls you are nasty \u2013 well unforgivably nasty, in fact \u2013 it\u2019s best that you keep the peace. You can\u2019t really blame her for telling it like it is. After all, you know that you\u2019re too sensitive\u2026 That you tend to overreact\u2026 That your depression is sure to cloud your judgement\u2026 That you overthink things\u2026 You know all this because she tells you so. Not to hurt or criticise, you understand. But because she loves you.\n\nYou know that she loves you because sometimes there still are those moments of bliss. Less frequently, of course. Not so often as they used to be. (B*ringing up a child isn\u2019t easy, you know!*) Well actually it\u2019s gotten to the point in which you\u2019ve given up trying. She tells you not to worry. That it\u2019s nobody\u2019s fault that you both have different sex drives. Naturally she has a point. Sometimes you try to tell her how unhappy this makes you feel. But it\u2019s not really that big a deal. Because every now and again \u2013 once or twice a month sometimes \u2013 you will feel her creamy flesh against yours. She will extend her arms towards you and for a brief few moments everything is as it should be. You inhale the love. A desperate unspeakable kind of love. How lucky you are to have found your soulmate. *You\u2019re the love of my life*, she will whisper in your ear. She tells you this all the time. \n\nHow is it possible that your daughter is starting senior school today? Why, it only seems like yesterday that you watched her mother squeeze that tiny body out from between her thighs and into the world. Do the years really pass so quickly? *You\u2019ve lost your mojo. You\u2019re not the man you used to be*, has become her mantra. *You used to be so wild\u2026Lippy\u2026 Uncontrollable. You really should see a doctor. Maybe therapy would be good for you*.\n\nAnd she\u2019s right. Of course she\u2019s right. You can feel it in you. You can see it in your reflection. How did you become such a disappointment? How could you let your *Love Twin* down like this? Surely she deserves better than you? She\u2019s an important woman now. You can\u2019t believe how much money she earns from that job of hers. Well, career is the more accurate way of describing it. *(Remember when you had a career?)* You\u2019re so proud of her. So proud that she gets to travel around the world: to New York, Milan, Paris, Berlin. You tell her that her achievement is your achievement. That staying home to babysit your daughter is small fry compared to the pressure, the responsibility that she has to bear in her day to day life. You\u2019re so proud of her. You really are.\n\nBut even as you have changed over the years, so has she. She\u2019s 44 now but looks ten years younger. Everybody says so. You\u2019re 53 but look ten years older. Nobody ever mentions this. They don\u2019t have to. *There\u2019s no getting away from the fact that you\u2019re an older man with no power*, she tells you sadly one afternoon. *Whereas I look better than I\u2019ve ever done.*\n\nAnd who can disagree? She does look better. More beautiful than she ever did in actual fact. And it\u2019s surely no accident. You have to admire her for the number of hours she puts in at the gym. You hate the gym yourself. You don\u2019t know how she does it. Certainly all her new friends seem to agree with her. They love her. They worship her. Who can blame them? *It\u2019s such a breath of fresh air*, you reassure yourself, *that she hangs out with all these young people. Much better than old farts like me*. It\u2019s incredible really. You don\u2019t know where she gets the energy from. Three\u2026 Four\u2026 Sometimes five nights a week she\u2019s out there putting in a full shift with those youngsters. Clubs\u2026 Gigs\u2026 Festivals\u2026 Fancy restaurants\u2026 *Well, with a job like hers she\u2019s entitled to let her hair down from from time to time. We all are.*\n\nBut where exactly did these people come from? These flawless, unblemished new friends of hers? You can\u2019t really be sure. They just seemed to appear one day, to materialise out of thin air: a couple of new faces here and there and then more and more and more. Names mentioned in passing and then in every other breath. And they carry with them new experiences\u2026 Alternative attitudes\u2026 Different language\u2026 New music\u2026 Indecipherable sounds that make no sense to you but your *Love Twin* somehow seems effortlessly comfortable with. She doesn\u2019t even listen to any of *your* music any more. But then, come to think of it she never *really* did listen to it anyway. How did you not notice?\n\nSometimes she even lets you tag along for the ride and you pretend to enjoy yourself as you\u2019re dragged around a gloomy dance floor inhabited by people twenty years your junior. *I don\u2019t really want to be doing this,* you whisper meekly to yourself, *but I love her and she\u2019s probably having some kind of mid-life crisis. Yes, that\u2019s it \u2013 a mid-life crisis. It\u2019s those pesky hormones again. Those irritating chemicals that are responsible for those infamous temper tantrums of hers. She needs my support so that one day she\u2019ll come back to me and I\u2019ll have her all to myself again. After all, I\u2019m her husband and best friend. It\u2019s my duty. It\u2019s the least I can do.*\n\nBut yes, it can hurt. Deep down it can really hurt. You never mention it but you hate how she dresses these days. Tight jeans\u2026 Plunging necklines\u2026 So much bare flesh. Who exactly is she putting it on display for? Well obviously it\u2019s for your benefit because you\u2019re the love of her life. You know this because barely a week goes by without her telling you so. Despite everything you still have that special bond that brought you together. That made you *Love Twins*. She\u2019s still your soul mate. She never stops telling you that. 17 years is a long time in anybody\u2019s book. And don\u2019t forget that you made a daughter *together*. A living, breathing human miracle.\n\nAnd then one day your reality crumbles. It dissolves into a fine dust that floats through the air and clogs up your lungs. By accident (was it really an accident?) you discover that she\u2019s not in abroad on work business as she is supposed to be. She\u2019s actually still in London. *What on earth is she doing there?* If text messages could scream your desperate ramblings would be heard at the far side of the universe. *Liar!* You exclaim. *How could you do this to me?!*\n\n*Stop making a fool of yourself,* comes her deadpan response. *He\u2019s just a friend helping me go through a difficult time \u2013 I\u2019m trying to sort out our relationship*. \n\n*Give me his name then!* You demand. *I don\u2019t know what you\u2019ll do*, she says. *I can\u2019t trust you.*\n\nSlowly, imperceptibly slowly, the truth is drip-fed to you over the coming weeks in bite-sized chunks. Hidden away in meaningless sentences the lies detach themselves from fact and float to the surface like oil in a puddle of muddy water. *I have feelings for him,* she tearfully admits one afternoon as you hunch before her, your voice hoarse from all the shouting. He\u2019s 31 \u2013 a whole quarter of a century younger than you \u2013 Italian, much better looking than the empty shell of a man that you\u2019ve become. *He\u2019s a nice guy,* she jauntily announces. *You should meet him.* \n\nAnd he\u2019s by no means the first, you discover this as you pick away at her tapestry of deception. *There was that young guy at the gym, do you know I was sexting him last year at the Xmas dinner table? Sending him naked pictures of myself, the ones that you took of me\u2026 And a couple of one-night stands at parties. No, I can\u2019t remember their names*\u2026 *Even a Calvin Klein model* she announces, scarcely able to conceal her pride. Her achievement. *I\u2019m pretty hot, you know*, she smirks. \n\nYou throw her out of the house and she takes an Uber to her Italian toyboy. You intercept the email that she sends him in transit: *I\u2019m sorry you had to be involved,* she writes*. My husband\u2019s gone crazy! I love you xxx*. \n\nAnd you have gone crazy. How could you not go crazy? And all her young friends know that you\u2019re crazy. Her family do, too. They know you\u2019re crazy because she\u2019s told them that you\u2019re crazy. Your *Love Twin* has made it her duty to do so. The love of your life that was never the love of your life has somehow become the victim in all of this. \n\n*You\u2019re pathetic*! she snarls. *You\u2019re a sponger! Over the years you\u2019ve bled me dry*! *You\u2019re a loser! Get a life/job!* Every day the insults smack you in the pit of your stomach. *You\u2019re a fat c\\*\\*t! You\u2019re vile! The gravy train is over! You need help! Even your daughter doesn\u2019t want or need you! I hate you! Stop abusing me!*\n\nYou lose all understanding. Your world collapses all around you. You don\u2019t know where all these words are coming from. You cannot recognise the person saying them. You cry. You rage. You plead. You whimper. Your *Love Twin* has gone. Somebody else has her now. And a stranger has taken her place. In a long neglected corner of your mind a memory prods away at the cobwebs. And you find yourself thinking back to that morning, all those years ago, and that alarm bell tinkling gently away in your loved-up brain. \n\nOf course you let her back in the house. Naturally you do. A couple of days later you greet her at the front door. You and your hangover. Your only companion. Your new best friend. You tearfully tell her you\u2019re prepared to forgive her. *Have you no self-respect?* comes her retort. So cold. So icy. You tell her you\u2019re willing to go into therapy with her. To try to work out why she\u2019s behaving like this. Both of you know that this isn\u2019t really her. Something has happened to mess up her head. 17 years together cannot be thrown away in the blink of an eye. *On one condition*, she frostily announces, *that I can carry on seeing him at the same time\u2026*\n\nAnd then one day it all becomes too much for you. The pressure crushes your spine. Your shoulders are blocks of ice. Nothing that you can force into your body will nullify the pain. You pack a couple of bags: Underwear. Socks. In only a couple of months you\u2019ve lost that thirty or forty pounds that you\u2019d piled on over the years. You look older than ever. And even the pills cannot bring the blessed relief of sleep. You say goodbye to your daughter, almost an adult now. You hug each other and she tries to hold back the tears. And you bid a last farewell to your *Love Twin*. \n\n*How could you do this to me?* you plead. *It was bigger than me*, she shrugs. \n\n*But how could you tell so many lies?* \n\n*I lie because I can*, she replies, smiling serenely.\n\nAnd then she wraps her arms around you and you feel her tears trickle down your cheek. *You\u2019re the love of my life*, she whispers as you close the door behind you and head off into nowhere, nothing to show for 17 years of commitment. Of love. Your thoughts flow like treacle. The pain of the loss, the agony of the betrayal overwhelms you, like a blade has been plunged into the epicentre of your soul. *How will I ever recover from this?* you ask yourself. *It\u2019s just not possible.* *How will I ever live again?*\n\nBut life goes on for some people. Of course it does. Barely 24 hours after bidding that tearful final farewell to *the love of her life,* her life partner for the best part of two decades, the father of her child*,* your *Love Twin* is parading her new toy before her parents and your dumbstruck daughter. His skin is taut and unwrinkled; his smile is earnest and sweetly innocent. He\u2019s in love, you know this because she told you that he is (*Although I\u2019m not in love with him \u2013 I\u2019m not in love with anybody actually\u2026).* If there was any pity left in your heart you would hand it to him freely and without hesitation.", "subreddit": "NarcissisticAbuse"}

My therapist suggested it.", "author": "maybe_a_narc", "self_text": "Hey,\n\nI wanted to write this letter to talk to you about different people. I know it's kind of a weird thing to have to talk about, but I think it's important and I hope you understand and can look back at this letter if you're ever confused when dealing with people you care about.\n\nI used to think that most people are like you and me, and I do think that there are a lot of good people, but some people have confused me. I want to make sure you can learn from my experience.\n\nYou know how there are some villains like in Disney movies. You probably think wow those are some bad people (or animals) depending on the movie. I know I've thought, wow they must have had bad parents to let them think that what they were doing was okay. They should know better than to treat other people (or animals) like that, geez.\n\nWell, sometimes people that seem good still do bad things. When I've seen that I thought, well they're just having a bad day or they must not realize that what they are doing is kinda mean. Sometimes these people who I thought were good kept doing mean things.\n\nI want to let you know you will need to let these people know that you see their bad behavior and you don't like it. I know it took me a long time to figure that out, especially when it's someone you really like or love. I didn't want them to stop liking me or loving me, so I kept making excuses for them being mean. Unfortunately, they think it's okay to act this way, and without you telling them it's not, they can keep on doing it. It might make you madder and madder because, duh, don't they know they're being mean and that's not good and they should stop?!?!\n\nI know it's hard to let people we like and love know we don't like something they did. It's scary, I know. But, if they really do like or love you, they'll listen to you. They'll care about what you have to say. They'll talk to you about it. They might cry and you might cry; that's okay. Crying feels weird but it's totally normal and if you're with someone you like or love that likes or loves you back, they'll want to take care of you when you cry. They'll want to understand you and they'll want to do better to not do mean things. Instead of making excuses for them, they'll be able to explain themselves. I've realized I'm not a mind reader, even though that would be an awesome super power, and I haven't met anyone else that is a mind reader, either.\n\nIt's really important how people you like or love respond when you tell them they did something you didn't like and why. Hopefully, they'll say something like \u201cOh I didn't realize that bothered you. I'm sorry, and I'll stop doing that. If I do it again, will you remind me?\u201d The hard part is if they don't take you seriously. It can really hurt if someone you like or love says something like \u201cCome on, you're being too sensitive. It wasn't that bad.\u201d That is not a good sign that this person cares for you the same way you care for them. It can really hurt and be shocking, like your jaw might even hang open, because you're so confused that they would treat you like that. I've even meet some people who lie and say it didn't happen. That's totally weird, and has made me really confused.\n\nSometimes, I've had people say the stuff that makes me feel good like they heard and understand me, but then they kept doing either the same thing or different things that are mean. This is really really hard, because they already said they're sorry and will try and stop but they didn't stop. You have to speak up for yourself again, and let them know, \u201chey, you did it again, and you said you would stop\u201d or \u201cwhat you just did made me uncomfortable.\u201d Just like before it might feel weird because you think duh, can't they see it.\n\nWhat I've figured out is that it's really important to trust the feeling in my stomach or heart. If it's hurting or feeling weird, that's a good sign that I'm not liking what's going on and need to speak up for myself. If the person I like or love keeps on doing things that are mean, and I keep telling them it's not okay with me, and they keep doing it, you probably have to stop hanging out with them. It's really not fun. You thought that this person liked or loved you back, but unfortunately they are not able to treat you the way you need to be treated, with kindness and respect.\n\nI really hope you don't ever find yourself in a situation with someone that you like or love that treats you in a mean way. But if it happens, I want you to know that I know you're way stronger than you think you are. You can stand up for yourself even when it's scary. You can walk away when someone is not being kind and respectful to you. You have the power, you're a good person and you deserve someone like you to be your friends and your family.\n\nI love you, man. And I know you love yourself, too.

In my defense our fights end up with me doing whatever he says just so the fight will stop. We also have 5 kids. I don\u2019t want to call the police to my house and have my kids see the police possibly take their dad taken away because of me.

I'm going to do my best not to be too graphic, but \\*Trigger Warning\\* nonetheless.\n\nSo, I'm a 26 year old man, and at 21, I got into my first and so far, only romantic relationship with my now ex-girlfriend. After becoming physically intimate for the first time in my life, walls seemed to start falling away in my mind, and childhood memories started rushing back to me. It started out as just feelings. Anything sexual would send me into these un-explainable fits of panic. And if that didn't happen and we were actually able to be intimate, I would feel this overwhelming sense of guilt and disgust at myself. After some time, I started getting more than just weird feelings, and I could actually see bits of a memory in my mind. I realized that when I was probably around 6-8ish, I was with my Mom at her friends house. Her friend had a daughter who was probably around 15 or 16. I remember being in her bedroom alone with her while our moms talked in the living room. She made me get into bed with her and made me take my clothes off. She told me that if I said anything, that I would get in trouble. I don't remember what happened next. I only remember eventually leaving the room and being terrified that my Mom would find out.  \n\n\nAfter having this revelation, I decided to talk to my mom. I told her that I think I might have been sexually abused. I didn't tell her the specifics at that point, but that's when she told that she had hoped I wouldn't remember. She then proceeded to explain how when she was trying to potty train me, that I would freak out and scream and was desperately afraid of going into a bathroom, and that it was later discovered that a male friend of my babysitter had been taking myself, as well as other children into the bathroom and abusing us, and that he was actually caught and prosecuted, and is probably still in prison to this day.  \n\n\nAfter some more time passed, I was eventually able to recall yet another instance of abuse at the hands of an older boy that was the son of another of my moms friends. This one was ongoing for probably about a year, and is the one that I now have the most complete recollection of.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI really struggled to cope with these things and I would have sudden panic attacks all the time. Between that and my near inability to be sexually intimate, there was a huge strain placed on my relationship with my girlfriend. That combined with some other unrelated issues, lead to us breaking up. After being single for a few months, the panic attacks and such seemed to gradually go away. Its been nearly a year and a half since I had any kind of anxiety attack, or even gave much thought to my abuse. I've been good at bottling stuff up and burying it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo a few days ago, all of a sudden, it all just rushed back and hit me like a train. I've started having panic attacks again. I've been unable to sleep. I'm super irritable. My chest just feels tight and my head feels like its made of lead or something. And I keep finding myself just spacing out. Like I'm not even here or something. Its all worse than what it was before. Its affecting me at work and people must be able to tell that somethings wrong, because everyone keeps asking me if I'm okay, but I don't really want to talk about it. My co-workers are actually my best friends. I'm a Deputy at a county jail, and my shift is like my second family. But I'm terrified that if I tell them whats going on, that they'll look at me and treat me differently. I feel like I'm coming unglued. I don't know what to do or how to cope with this. I've talked to 3 different therapists before and I guess it didn't really help. Part of me feels like I'm completely over-reacting. Like I should just suck it up or something, since its all in the past anyway, and its far and away from the worst thing that ever happened to someone. I just don't know. Any advice at all would be hugely appreciated. Thank you in advance, and sorry this post was so long. I don't really have anyone to vent to, so I guess this all just kind of poured out of me once I picked up the keyboard.", "subreddit": "abuse"}

I mistook intensity and ferocity for intimacy and love. The difference is, intimacy and love deepen while intensity and ferocity burn out. I didn\u2019t see the real you for a long time. I took the lovebombing version of you from the first two months and weaved a fantasy from that. That is on me. I faked myself out because you showed me who you really were the first time you discarded me and wouldn\u2019t respond to me. I ignored everything after that and lived in my fantasy world, only seeing the amazing guy from the lovebombing that never showed up again fully in real life. I took all the silent treatments, withdrawing of affection, gaslighting, stonewalling, disrespect, lack of even the slightest consideration, broken promises, lies, and discards over and over. It became normal. I craved the return to mediocrity after those episodes\u2014-mistaking it for wonderful. I began to shrink myself and walk on eggshells. I started feeling worthless, unlovable. I felt bad for having emotions or needs. The discard in December and two months of no contact allowed me to analyze and research and separate myself enough to start putting the pieces back together. I started working on myself. That was your mistake. You waited too long to hoover. My eyes were open, maybe not as wide as they should have been but I was ready this time! I was on the lookout. I was prepared to uphold my standards. I\u2019ll admit... you sucked me back in a little at first. The minor lovebombing and saying you wanted to get married right away almost got me. Almost convinced me you had changed. Then you did me a favor and you started disappearing again without explanation or apology. Then I found r /narcissticabuse. I found Us in the stories of others. I found you there and the final click hit me directly in the face. You won\u2019t change. You can\u2019t. I had to end it.\n\nI firmly believe this sub saved my life. Not because he was ever violent but because he was eating my soul, my self worth, my love of life and I didn\u2019t even realize it. r /exnocontact got me started in the right direction. This sub was the final push I needed to see him and us for what it really was and to end it once and for all. He\u2019s now blocked on everything. Thank you. Thank you all for sharing your stories and your pain. I wish you all more love than you can handle. -S", "subreddit": "NarcissisticAbuse"}

If I cry I can't cry alone, he has to know why that moment.\n- Has started to demand sex and get angry and grumpy if I don't give it to him\n- Will go out of his way to research something to prove me wrong even if he doesn't care about it. Common for him to bring up a comment I made two hours later as he's been researching in the meantime to disprove it.\n- The cuddle - I hugged a male friend and he told me I had basically cheated on him and broken his trust and said 'everyone thought your actions were innapropriate' but when I asked someone that was there (who didn't think my actions innapropriate) and told him, he said their opinion didn't matter and that I shouldn't have to seek validation from others.\n- New Years Eve - split up with me and demanded I book a ticket that moment and he drive me to airport. When I said no I'll get a hotel and go on my own terms he changed his tune as he couldn't control how I left so wanted me to stay. Then sent me text messages whilst in the same room as me (at his family's house, with them in the room!) asking me if we could still have casual sex. When I said no, he asked why I wouldn't have sex with him as I had with dozens of men before and I was trashy and a slut.\n- If we were ever in hotels I wasn't to leave the hotel room on my own 'or he'd be worried about me'. He once yelled at me until I cried because I went down to the lobby to get him a coffee whilst he was in the shower.\n- Used to constantly tell me stories about ex gfs and girls he's dated when we first got together and told me his best friend once said she was in love with him - attempt to trigger insecurity in me?\n- Almost everything I do is wrong - Will slam the toilet lid down in front of me if I forget to put it down. I drain vegetables wrong, I put things into containers wrongs, I use too many utensils when I cook, I load the dishwasher wrong.\n- Acted like I was vain and strange and said I am 'not who he thought I was' when I wanted to occasionally put on makeup on as I didn't/don't wear it often\n- Withholds affection when I 'displease him'.\n- Expects me to have sex with him almost every day, if I ever don't want to have sex because I'm not in the mood I'm told 'people who love someone would want to do anything to make them feel good'. Insinuating I don't love him.\n- Said I was asking for attention by making eye contact and was 'falling over myself impressed' by men on motorbikes... that beeped at me and scared me so I laughed at how much it made me jump.\n- Would talk at me in circular conversations for hours, especially at night to make me anxious before bed or keep me up into the early morning when I had to be up for work.\n- Said he was suicidal when I broke up with him.\n\n\n\nI think we could all agree he was abusive, but my question is this: HOW do I seperate where his abusive behaviour ended and my failings begin?\n\nExample: He says my not wanting to have sex with him was me withholding to be abusive! But actually I just didn't feel like it because I was so stressed and depressed from his unrelenting behaviour... but is that just us both seeing it differently?\n\nExample 2: He was VERY anxious and needy and I'm quite secure/avoidant, he said I was the one MAKING him like that because I didn't need the affection he did or time together. I said no your neediness and the resulting behaviour (above) is just plain unhealthy... was that a failure on my part to not be sympathetic enough?\n\nExample 3: Should I have not hugged/cuddled a male friend if it was outside of his boundaries or is he creating unrealistic and overly-posessive boundaries?\n\nExample 4: At times I would have to leave the conversation and walk out of the room and get flustered and upset. From my perspective it was because he would go on and on and on and on and on forever saying I'm cold and heartless and have no regard for his feelings and if I did I would make changes. From his perspective he would say abusers walk out of rooms and don't finish conversations or come to agreements/conclusions.\n\n\nI just feel like my reality... has been distorted. I'm not sure of anything at the moment but I'm also a fair person and I self-critique so I wanted to know if you perceive me to have also done anything wrong here??\n\n\n\n\nTl;dr my ex boyfriend was being abusive but I would like clarification on my role within this.", "subreddit": "NarcissisticAbuse"}

This isn't something I want to remember. But it plays back in my head almost every night, and maybe shouting it out to the ether will somehow give some kind of release and those nightmares will stop. I'm writing this in the middle of the night and I can't sleep. Don't know if I'll submit this or delete it once I've written this. Who knows.  \n\n\nIt started when I was around 7 years old. When I was \"of age\", apparently. I never knew my mother. The story I was given was that she never wanted me. So my father give her a lump sum of \"fuck off\" money and she split with a former boyfriend. Who knows where she is right now. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBuried in the woods, I can only hope.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnyway. 7 years old. I've never liked thunderstorms. They've always scared the devil out of me. I remember it being really bad that night. The tree in my neighbours garden fell and totalled the greenhouse just outside of my bedroom window. I didn't want to stay in there in case another tree ended up in my bedroom, so I grabbed my teddy and ran into my father's bedroom to sleep in his bed where I thought it was safe. He'd been drinking heavily that day. He always did the day he got paid. He was a lawyer, but he drank like a bum. But I didn't really think about it. All I was thinking was \"daddy will keep me safe'.  \n\n\nWhen I got into bed with him he was awake. I can't remember a lot of what he whispered to me.Some of it was nonsensical. But I remember distinctly how he kept telling me he would \"take my mind off of the storm\". And if I closed my eyes really tightly, I'd soon forget about all of it. I won't go into details. I can't because I think if I try I'll throw up. But he did something no father should ever do. Whether he was so drunk that he forgot how old I was...that I was even his daughter at that point...I couldn't give a fuck. I just remember being more scared than I have ever been in my life. And the pain. I couldn't understand if my daddy loved me so much, how he could hurt my like that. I wasn't old enough to understand what was really going on, but I knew it was very wrong.  And I couldn't make a sound. I couldn't scream. I couldn't try and fight him off. I couldn't move. And when he was done and he rolled over and fell asleep like nothing had happened, I just cried and cried until I fell asleep.   \n\n\nThat was the first time my father ever hurt me like that, and the last time I ever remember feeling completely safe.  \n\n\nEver since I managed to get away from my \"family\" home five years of trauma later, I haven't been able to get away from it. Never been able to trust another person fully. At 30 years old I still feel like a prisoner to the years of abuse. A prisoner of him.", "subreddit": "abuse"}

Narcissist was a word I was somewhat familiar with and honestly I was pretty skeptical that every single breakup on Instagram seemed to be bc of a narc. Lol I brought it up with my therapist the first time in therapy bc my father was diagnosed npd and a mean aunt accused me of being the same when I posted some opinions on FB that were opposing to hers on my own page. Of course it was quickly ruled out, but I do have a pretty mean anxiety disorder that makes me believe everything everyone thinks and says about me is true. \n\nThe term narc came up again beginning of February when the rollercoaster with my narc friend went off the rails. Constant emotional blowouts every other day. Which were made so much worse by his avoiding and defending and only ever arguing, never could he have a conversation about feelings without turning it into a 3day event. It was clear I needed to go NC like I had already tried in October 2018 and then again in DEC..... the trauma bond was deep. He would cry and beg and say all the right things. The very next day he would be right back on his defensive bs. \n\nI do have ADHD. I do have RSD. I am hypersensitive. However the things we argued about were simple. Like \u201chey I have anxiety can you please not avoid and breadcrumb me for 7hrs when we are talking about something emotional?\u201d I mean, is that too much? I don\u2019t think it is. It\u2019s not like he didn\u2019t know. I was very clear with my boundaries in December. The relationship was toxic and that is one example of maybe 5 or less things I needed to move forward. Along with \u201cplz talk something out, call me instead of letting it drag on all day, don\u2019t defend and make it an argument\u201d .... does that make me neurotic?? I mean he never did these things. And that\u2019s when my therapist mentioned the NPD. She was careful not to diagnose him but she strongly suggested NC and I agreed. \n\nMarch was a shit show. Every other day I would say I needed NC and he would cry. It broke my heart. So the next day I would text and try to find compromise just one more time. And an argument would ensue. It was a traumatic month. We finally decided to take a break if he promised to go see a dr. He sent me proof of his apt and spent all week talking out why he said some of the more disturbing things he had said. And let me point out, I didn\u2019t force him to go to the dr bc of NPD, I asked him to do that to keep contact in the future bc of his severe bouts of depression and suicide that he \u201conly talked to me about.\u201d That was a heavy weight on my shoulders. Bc if I went NC and he killed himself it would feel like my fault. Now looking back, I\u2019m not sure he did ever have an issue with it. I think he used it as a way to control me. But I don\u2019t know for sure so let\u2019s just assume that he does. \n\nNow for the part most people hate me for \ud83d\ude2c He has been my best friend since I was 13, he was 18. I\u2019m now 32.  We formed our attachment over the internet when the chatrooms were brand new to everyone. We talked nightly, sometimes all night, I\u2019ve never ever had a connection like I do with him where we can both talk to each other for hours and it\u2019s never enough. We never met due to age difference and then moving around, relationships, marriage, we were just best friends who talked most days. We would have months and sometimes years between talking but we always came back. \n\nNow that I\u2019m more familiar with NPD I realize that his falling away was a discard and the times he came back were hoovers. We are both married to other people. My husband knows I\u2019ve always talked to him, his wife did not. He hid it from her. I understood why. We didn\u2019t talk about it an awful lot. Was there a sexual aspect? Sure. Very heavy on his part. This led to fallout. I felt we had always been best friends, after the first 3yrs this time of talking, I started to suspect I was just someone he wanted to have an affair with. I wasn\u2019t opposed to that but there were red flags that maybe he saw me as less than. Like maybe I was only ever someone he would sleep with and never someone he would tell others about. \n\nThis was a major insecurity of mine since he would never have anything to do with me when we were young bc of the age difference. I didn\u2019t feel good enough. He made me feel like if I was prettier he would. But he needed proof. This was back when you had to scan pics onto the computer you guys lol I was awkward at 13 and didn\u2019t want to. He made me SO insecure. I developed an eating disorder right after we stared talking then. I started sleeping with older guys his age. Which now, looking back, those were NOT GOOD GUYS. I did that. Not him. I get that. I\u2019m just giving background on why my attachment to him is so deep. Those insecurities and desires to be good enough for him were formed for me when my brain was just developing into an adult brain and the hold there is strong.\n\nSo talking to each other was second nature. But 11yrs ago when he was just dating his now wife, he made me feel even worse. To the point I didn\u2019t want him in my life anymore. He would have me driving around talking to him every day. I already had a relationship with my now husband and child with him. He would try and guide our conversations into sexual conversations which I wasn\u2019t always comfortable with. I was basically in love with him at that time if I\u2019m being honest. I wanted to be together in real life. I didn\u2019t want to hookup. I wanted to meet and see if this was real. It wasn\u2019t a secret, I told him often. He was constantly degrading me. I smoked. I wasn\u2019t rich. I had dropped out of college to be a mom and gave up my career aspirations. I mean the only career I ever pursued was acting and after I moved out of NYC and into rural KY it just wasn\u2019t logical to continue that as a career path. Lol more importantly, I was a mom. I loved being a mom and I wanted to be the BEST mom. It is my first priority and I don\u2019t think he understood that. He saw it as lazy. He accused me of being on food stamps. He hated my image basically. Funny thing is, and I only say this bc it feels relevant, I\u2019m a lot more attractive than he is. Lol he is awkward which is his source of insecurity and I was always sensitive to that. But if we were together as a couple it would look like a mismatch. I pursued acting on stage and was quickly moved to screen bc of being more attractive. I never felt that way though. I never felt good enough for anyone, I knew everyone thought I was pretty, but it didn\u2019t feel good enough. I didn\u2019t believe them. While talking to him on the phone that time I started to suspect he was never my friend. This was the dawn of MySpace and now he could see me and he was interested in me bc of how I looked. We had a fallout, I told him I would not be a sleazy cheater and I was not his backup. If he wanted me, he needed to meet me and it needed to be somewhere public and during the day. I was discarded the next day. \ud83d\ude11\n\nThat killed me. It killed me. Now I know it was bc of the RSD but then I had no idea. I thought I lost the love of my life bc I wasn\u2019t good enough for him. That is how it felt and it was my worst nightmare. Embarrassingly, a week after the discard I wrote him a MySpace message begging to meet and I would let him do whatever he wanted to me. I was convinced if he would just meet me he would love me and we would live happily ever after. That was the day he informed me he bought a ring, it was for her. But he still would \u201calways be there for me.\u201d \nI. Was. Devastated. As a mom I was so ashamed I wrote that message basically offering sex as an inventive to meet me. I felt so trash. Just like trash. I was ashamed that my own husband at that time was just waiting for me to set a date for our wedding. I had been engaged to him for years and I wouldn\u2019t set a date bc I was so certain my best friend was possibly the love of my life. He was not. \n\nI got better after that, but it was a process. I blocked him on everything bc looking at him made me fall apart. I spent so much time leaving my house when my husband got home to just drive and cry and scream. Oh and here is the best part, his girlfriend, now wife, was from my hometown and the town I lived in at that time. YES. You read that right. I never met him and he was going to be getting married in my effing hometown. SMALL HOMETOWN. They would be coming for holidays. I felt SO betrayed. I know that\u2019s weird but I knew him first. He was mine, in my mind. It felt like he was doing it just to torture me and I swear to god that\u2019s the only reason he started dating her. I just know it is. My anxiety was always on high. I hated leaving the house bc what if he was there visiting with her and I saw him at our one Walmart? I was seriously so mentally unstable. Heartbroken. And I couldn\u2019t tell anyone. Til my husband found my phone records and then I just confessed everything. \n\nHe was so sweet you guys. That man had every reason to leave me, I wanted him to, but he was so sweet and understanding. I learned at that time that I was so lucky and I fell in love with him all over again. We got married at the courthouse bc I was NOT going to plan a wedding in the same town as my \u201cex best friend.\u201d We quickly got pregnant with our second child and things got better. It was months of emotional stress, don\u2019t get me wrong, he didn\u2019t forgive me overnight and we had issues and I was grieving \u201cmy friend\u201d but we made it and we got so much better. \n\nFast forward to 2012. My youngest was 3. Facebook was now the big platform. MySpace was dead. I was a stay at home mom, still in that small town but planning to move to a much bigger city. I was healed but I still stressed around holidays that I would see him. I couldn\u2019t deal and I needed out. A few times I swore I saw him and his wife drive by my house. How sad I thought, that he would drive by with her and she had no idea why. I got super healthy in that time of healing. I quit smoking. My husband started a successful business. We started to have a good money flow and I was no longer \u201ctrash\u201d to my friend. I was better than ever. While his wife was gaining weight (as we all do after marriage and babies) suddenly he was on my friend requests. They\u2019d had a baby. I felt so proud of him. Looking at him instantly made my heart ache. Maybe now we can be real friends I thought. Bc now we are equal. Married with babies. No pressure for sex. Yeah. I was super fucking dumb. Lol I approved but I did not talk to him. He was just there in my timeline. He\u2019d send messages and I wouldn\u2019t reply. I think I congratulated him once on his baby but that was it. His messages were friendly. I just still had no interest in talking. He hurt me and that wound was not healed. \n\nIn 2013 the messages got heavier. He knew I was moving away, maybe he felt more pressure. He asked to call me and u said no. Every time. I said no. Til I didn\u2019t. I said he could text me if he wanted but I would not speak to him on the phone ever again. He didn\u2019t like that. He didn\u2019t text. He didn\u2019t message anymore. I rejected him and he sulked. Honestly I was relieved. But my bday that year he didn\u2019t say happy birthday. Now that is something we did every year, even when he was blocked on everything I would email him \u201chappy birthday\u201d nothing else. He did the same. Every year since I was 13. Even when I hated him. By not doing it that year, he hooked me back in. He hurt me and gained my interest. I didn\u2019t speak to him bc I was so hurt. Til my birthday in 2014. I got a text. Happy birthday. From that number I used to love so much. It made my day you guys and I knew I was in trouble. I knew it. He had me back at 13. I wanted him and I finally felt like he thought I was good enough. We started texting daily then. We were back at being instant best friends. He claimed he didn\u2019t meet me back when we were talking bc he had felt like he would hurt my family. I believed him. It made sense. He\u2019s a great guy I thought. He cared. \ud83d\ude44\n\nFrom 2014-2016 it was everything I ever wanted from him. But I still wouldn\u2019t speak to him on the phone. It was only txt. He begged. I liked him begging me. I was finally where I wanted to be with him. I knew I was more attractive than his wife (I know that\u2019s mean) but it\u2019s just honesty. I knew he wanted me. I knew he felt he made a mistake throwing me away before and it felt SO GOOD. I finally had his approval. His adoration. He love bombed me so hard and I was in control. He felt inferior to me FINALLY. And I loved it. \n\nThere were so many red flags tho. So many. Right off the bat he lied about his wife being pregnant. When I found out I was disgusted with him and told him not to talk to me anymore. He lied and I knew it was shady af. But he apologized and said he just didn\u2019t want to lose me again. He gained back my trust. He started to do the same as before. Knocking me down with jokes that were insults. I was a hippie. All love and light. Yoga mom. Stay at home mom. He insulted me in a way that wasn\u2019t obvious but I felt it. \n\nHe picked me apart and the insecure girl slowly came back. He was still sleazy but he was more careful with me. He bragged about going out and rubbing up on women. He bragged once about putting his hand down a woman\u2019s pants in a bar. Asking another to show her breasts for a free drink. He bragged about how much money he made. A LOT. All of these things were turn offs obviously. But in a way I just felt sad for him. He didn\u2019t feel above me anymore so he didn\u2019t demand the sexual conversations the way he did before when I was young. \n\nHe gave me so much time. He was always in my phone. Always txting first. Never the first to say bye. He loved me. I knew he was in love with me and I just wanted to enjoy it. He kept asking to meet and I couldn\u2019t do it. I didn\u2019t want to. I knew I didn\u2019t want to. I couldn\u2019t be a cheater and I didn\u2019t want to cheat with him. I just wanted his approval and yes you guys, I know that\u2019s wrong and I know that\u2019s \u201ccheating\u201d in a way. I know it is. But I\u2019m just being honest. \n\nI felt protective of his wife. I stood up for her when he talked about her weight. When he put her down. He talked about their sex life which he claimed was awful. I stood up for her bc I am a wife and a mom and we all go thru that shit. We gain weight and we don\u2019t have sex as much after kids and he was telling me every awful thing you are afraid your husband is thinking during those times. We bonded over things like that. Him venting to me about life and marriage and me comforting him. I was a real friend to him. Or so I thought.\n\nIf I ever tried to vent to him about my life or marriage I was just opening myself up to criticism. If my husband did anything and I vented about it, my friend would say he was cheating. Always. I stopped venting bc I started getting so insecure about my husband. I quickly learned the relationship with my friend was one sided. He wanted to tell me EVERYTHING about his life and I enjoyed it so much bc of being rejected by him my whole life, but slowly I started to see that I couldn\u2019t tell him anything without being shoved down. I started to not like myself anymore. I was so happy and positive and easy going and I started to hate myself again. He begged me for pics. We traded them, pics about our lives, funny things we saw during the day, funny things our kids did. So much of it was genuinely best friend talk. But the ugly underbelly was him begging me to send nudes. In November of 2016 I stopped talking to him. It was sorta an experiment. I noticed I was always texting first suddenly. I wanted to know how one sided it was. After almost two years of me not really giving him what he wanted, he started losing interest. I wanted to know if he would notice me leaving. \n\n6 months later and nothing I realized he wasn\u2019t what I thought. He was sleazy and it was one sided. He wasn\u2019t my friend, he was interested in sex and I wasn\u2019t giving anything of that sort so he bailed. 6months of no talking. All bc I decided not to text first. I thought maybe a few weeks before he noticed, but no, 6 MONTHS.\n\nI was hurt but ok. He wasn\u2019t what I wanted. I didn\u2019t like him even tho I loved him. I was hurt I lost his interest and approval. But I would not ever be with this man and I didn\u2019t want to be. I knew that. So I let it go. Then one day I get a text. He claimed he thought I was dissing him. I explained it was one sided and we had our first argument. I felt awful. I felt like I had done to him what he had done to me so many times before. He felt rejected and hurt over that 6months (he claimed)  so I ended up apologizing. \n\nThe love bombing started again. He literally started saying I love you. A lot. I felt I had my friend back and I\u2019m ashamed to say pics started flowing. I felt bad about not talking to him for 6months and I felt approval again which I think can feel a lot like love. We had an amazing summer. Summer 2017 I had the relationship with him I\u2019d always dreamt of. It was like we were dating almost. Nightly texts. Constant adoration. Real conversations. No insults. It was a great summer. \n\nAnd then the ceiling caved in. He got more braggy than ever. He started making a lot of money and could buy whatever he wanted. I\u2019m not impressed by money and I am especially not impressed by bragging.  He started bragging about going out again. And this time it was me who was feeling a little jealous rather than being sad for his wife. He became above me again. Degrading me and insulting me passive aggressively. He stopped txting again. He would still txt but late in the afternoon and he would leave quickly. I became depressed. This is when I was diagnosed with adhd and RSD. (Rejection sensitivity dysphoria) it is similar to manic depression. I was also diagnosed with clinical depression. Anxiety. I got really sick. I have an auto immune disease that reactivated mono. I was in and out of the hospital and doctors appointments. They thought at one point I had cancer. Scary shit. I felt like I was collapsing. I tried to talk to him about it but he was never around. One day he told me he didn\u2019t think my husband loved me anymore and it set me off. I blocked him on Facebook. He texted me the next day and all of it came spewing out of me. My insecurities. My suspicion he only wanted sex. That it was just pics he was after and one he got that he lost interest after a while. I asked if we could just talk about it one night, like we used to when we were trading pics every night. He said he would try. He didn\u2019t. I was devastated. He claimed it was bc of his furniture arrangements and his wife being there but we had been trading pics and talking every night ALL SUMMER. It didn\u2019t make sense. I knew he was lying. I felt so mad. Like omg he really is just a sleazy guy who never cared about me as a friend. This was all about the sex stuff for him he took advantage and bailed when I needed him. I wasn\u2019t forgiving. We have been fighting ever since. That was October- November 2017. \n\nI deleted my Facebook at that time. I couldn\u2019t stand to look at him. He would ignore my txts but show up on my messenger as active. I felt so alone at that time. Going thru the depression and physical illness didn\u2019t help. He blamed me. I felt crazy. He called me too sensitive and he just got SO MEAN. So mean. He never apologized for the lie. He got so mad about me telling him it felt like he only wanted the pictures. He punished me by stonewalling me. All my insecurities came back. He had money and success now. I was hot, but not anyone to be proud of. I didn\u2019t have status. I was a joke to him. I felt it. It killed me. And yeah, I deserved it I guess. I mean, I wasn\u2019t his wife or his girlfriend. But I wasn\u2019t his friend either. So what was I? It left me only with one thing. I was the sleazy girl he wanted to hookup with. (Still wouldn\u2019t) I was trash again. \n\nOver the last 4/5 years I never met him. He begged and I wouldn\u2019t. I changed from happy and light to dark and sad. Insecure. Depressed.  Not good enough. As a last attempt to gain back his interest I told him he could call me again. After almost 4yrs. I caved. I was that girl who was messaging him I would sleep with him again. I just wanted the approval back. So we started talking on the phone. It was good for a week or two. Then we just argued all the time. He wouldn\u2019t hear me. I would text books about my feelings. Everything I just wrote here I would confide in him. Searching for a real friend in him. He was so mean. He made fun of me. Mocked me. Didn\u2019t read half of them. So much meaner than I thought he could be. He would say I love you but then degrade me. It hurt so much. So much. I was sick. I lost my best friend. I felt like trash. 2018 was an emotional roller coaster. Me telling him I could never talk to him again, weeks of txt fights. Evenings spent of me crying in my closet. Sobbing. I felt so alone. He was my ONLY friend. I am introverted and the depression and illness isolated me. I was in a constant state of emotional distress. \n\nWhen I decided to start adhd medication I stared to get better. I could think clearer. I saw him manipulating me. Lying. He couldn\u2019t gaslight me anymore bc I had my brain back. I became firm in my decision to go NC. On his birthday of all days. Little did I know he was in Mexico with his wife. He lied and said he was working. He told me his feelings changed for me when I got sick (when I caught him in that lie) that he \u201cwould still\u201d talk but he couldn\u2019t be like we were (when he was getting all my attention and nudes) we \u201ccould still\u201d trade pics, but he didn\u2019t have time for all the txting (boring friend stuff) so I told him to F off. I called him out for being sleazy. I told him how gross he was and that he only wanted me for the hook up and pics. I told him I should tell his wife what he did. He hung up. Turned off his phone. I thought he was working in his office so when I realized I couldn\u2019t call him back on his cell I called his office. 7-15x in a row \ud83d\ude11 he was in Mexico. Her mom was there at their house. My name showed on the caller ID. He was caught and I looked crazy. \n\nThat was October 2018. He attempted suicide (he threatened this a lot over 2018 and our fights) I felt HORRIBLE. I didn\u2019t have to call him. HAD NO IDEA he was in Mexico. I effed up and he blamed me for all of it. He would block me at night bc she told him she\u2019d leave if he talked to me. During the day I would call or text and cry with him about all of it. I felt like a terrible friend. Terrible person. However in December I knew it was time to move on. I wrote him a text that was super long explaining I could never talk to him again. Like so many others he had ignored. And something crazy happened.... he replied. To every part of that txt. Said he read it 20x. He cried with me. He owned he was an asshole that year. He owned it was his fault for lying about Mexico. He understood why I called. He owned all of it. Begged for a chance to be better. Told me he loved me. Couldn\u2019t be without me. Everything I wanted for over a year, he said it. I bought it. But omg. It only lasted a week. We fought so much and cried so much over the last 4months. He would claim to get it and then hurt me he next day. Til a few weeks ago. That first time he ever screamed at me. Called me pyscho. Called me stalker. 2hrs of that. His wife heard the last 5-10mins of it. \n\nHe was screaming psycho stalker. I had told him we could never talk again and he lost his shit and acted like he was discarding me. Even tho I knew he wasn\u2019t, it felt like he was. I\u2019m 97% sure he knew she was listening to the last part. I can\u2019t see any other reason he would call me that. But to her, I\u2019m the bad guy. Obviously. The other woman. The stalker. She knew I called several times before. He scapegoated me the last time he was caught and this time it really sounded like I was stalking him. He won. \n\nThe things he screamed that night were deliberate ways to hurt me. To trigger my RSD. He knew all about it. To trigger my anxiety by threatening to come to my house. He took all the power I had in saying goodbye. He took it and he had to have known. It had to be on purpose. He wanted control over me. To hurt me. To kill me emotionally. \n\nHe made fun of me crying. Told me I was \u201cplaying victim.\u201d He said every damn thing that ever hurt me that he had apologized for and told me it was a lie. He screamed it in a weird monotone drunk voice that I didn\u2019t even know.\n\nI called and texted like crazy the next day bc he threatened suicide. He had also threatened to call the police on me for harassment. Something be threatened before but later admitted it was a lie to hurt me. I didn\u2019t know his wife heard. She sent a text apparently but I had blocked him. She told me to leave him alone or she would go to the police. I didn\u2019t get it but Monday he finally answered my call and talked for maybe 3mins. He told me she had txted and that she would go to the police. Then he hung up. \n\nAll the times I had fantasized about telling her about his dick pics. Telling her who I was and what he did to me, and all I could think about was omg if she leaves him he will kill him self this time. She HAD TO KNOW. I HAD TO TELL HER. I sent her a message on FB. I sent him a message on his email. I apologized and y\u2019all I took up for him. I told her it was all me. I told her I made him feel bad about not talking. I just wanted him to survive this. I spent the rest of the week crying and being a zombie. Bed all day. All day. Ugly heaving cries. Calling and leaving him voicemails asking him to plz forgive me and plz don\u2019t hurt me (like he said he would) and plz don\u2019t hurt himself. I sounded like a pyscho. Just like he said. I played it perfectly. \n\nI emailed her one more time that week and told her about his suicide attempts and how they dated back to when we were teens. I promised her I wasn\u2019t crazy. (Which sounds crazy) \ud83e\udd26\ud83c\udffc\u200d\u2640\ufe0f begged her to make him keep that appointment I mad him make. Told her I was so sorry. Then panicked the rest of the week that the police would come arrest me for emailing her and calling him twice. \n\nI have panic attacks every day. I hear his mean screams when I try to fall asleep. I wake up to them in nightmares. My legs shake for no reason (still don\u2019t get that one) I cry at everything. Not bc of losing him forever. No. That part I am relieved about. But I\u2019m terrified  he will kill him self and it will be my fault. Terrified she will leave him and he will come hunt me down like he said. Terrified she took every time I called him over and over to the police. \n\nHe told me I destroyed his life. He said that screaming. I felt it in my fucking bones. I\u2019m not ok with any of it. \n\nIf anyone read this thank you. I just needed it out.  The original question was, \n\n \u201cAm I the narcissist for still wanting an apology for him screaming and threatening me?\u201d\n\nHe is going thru a lot. Even tho it\u2019s his fault and he deserves it. But I can\u2019t sleep, eat, or function bc of what he said. I think he knows it. He could have called and been kind. He could have told her the truth, at least half of it. Told her he wanted to talk to me but it was over. Told me that day he didn\u2019t mean what he said on the phone. He could\u2019ve called and been kind. He hates me. He blames me. She blames me. I\u2019m the pyscho stalker. I\u2019m back to being trash. I have thoughts of wanting to stop breathing. Of never waking up. Of someone hitting me head on. I would never hurt myself. I love my kids too much to do that to them. But I\u2019m not ok either. I don\u2019t want to be here anymore.\n\nEveryone hates me. I\u2019m the other woman. The cheater who got what she deserved, no one cares what he did to me. What he started doing to me when I was 13. It doesn\u2019t matter to them when they find out he is married. When they find out he threatened the police they take his side. I have no right to talk to him. No right to an apology. I feel like trash and other people on reddit have confirmed that for me.  \ud83d\ude1e \n\nAnd maybe they\u2019re right. Maybe I got what I deserved. But he gets nothing. She believed him bc I helped her to. I look crazy. He looks innocent. No one will ever know what he did. He always comes out above me. \n\nSometimes I wish I was the narc. I don\u2019t wanna feel anymore. I want to not care. To puff myself up. I hate everyone and I feel so broken. I just want out of this feeling and I need him to unsay what he said. \n\nSorry for the book. Even if no one ever reads this. At least I got it out of me. Maybe someone did. I just need my story out. Bc I\u2019ve been silenced in every way for so long. Thank you friends. Even if you do hate me and think I\u2019m gross and a cheater, this sub has saved me. \nMaybe literally. I love all of you.

A lot of things are making sense, and yet I don't even know how to feel", "author": "another_rdt_account", "self_text": "A little backstory:  \n\n\nI've been in a relationship with my ex girlfriend for a little over 4 years. Other than the first few months, our relationship has been on and off constantly. I'm sure we've broken up / got back together over 10 times through the years.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThroughout the years I've felt like I was always doing something wrong, there were always issues with everything in my life that she did not like. She hated my family, hated my best friend (along with all my other friends), never wanted to be a part of my life or be into the things I enjoyed. For some reason I accepted it over the years, I assumed that she had her own reasons for not liking the people I hung out with, I'm pretty much an introverted nerd and she was a social butterfly in my eyes so I figured there was too much of a personality difference between her and my friends.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhen it came to just me and her, I'll admit that it felt fine, until there were any disagreements. Anything that I would disagree with her on would be met with huge backlash, and low blows to me (comparing me to ex's, my performance in bed, my family and friends are \"trash\", I would \"never meet another girl like her\", etc). These fights would usually end up with us breaking up, but she would come back and apologize and I always felt like she had changed, until we inevitably disagree about something again (usually disagreement about the same things that we argued about before).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFast forward to now:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA few days ago she expressed interest in wanting to stream (twitch) to possibly make money on the side, which I thought would be a great idea. She then expressed the idea of purposefully being sexual to attract horny viewers into watching. I told her that I was uncomfortable with that idea, as I feel like it's morally wrong. But I told her I understand the reasons why someone would want to do that, it seems like easy money, and if that's what she wants to do I would not want to be a part of it and not know about it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis was met with insane backlash and being told that I'm \"stupid\" and that I \"don't understand how hard her life is\". I tried calmly explaining again that I do understand, I just don't agree with it, which was met with a \"I don't care about how you feel, why does everything have to be about you?\", and more insults.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe had a call later that night and I was told that \"All I want is more money, I don't care who I fuck over in the process, my life is hard\". I expressed the fact that I can't handle being in a relationship where my partner doesn't care how I feel, which was met with a \"I don't care if we breakup, I really don't fucking care\". Being so numb to hearing the same thing with our previous breakups, I simply said that \"I also can't be friends with my ex\", to which she was very unhappy with that and yelled at me saying \"I don't see why you can't, I'm a good person. You're really gonna throw all this away?\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI guess you could call this luck, but around this time I was at my parents house visiting, and my mom was in a relationship with a narcissist and told me that she sounds like she has the same symptoms of one. After reading up on this and viewing places like this subreddit, my mind almost snapped in shock. Everything made sense, everything had to be about her. She was always fine about us breaking up which is why it happened so often, but she hated the idea that I didn't want to be friends with her because I didn't like her personality.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI have blocked her from everything, we're not in contact, and yet I still don't know how I feel. I feel a little doubtful because I'm not a doctor and perhaps she's not a narcissist, maybe all this is one big misunderstanding and I'm wrong. But if she is, it makes a lot of sense of why these 4 years have been so...odd and off. Noone understood why we kept coming back together, but after reading this subreddit it sounds like a case of \"lovebombing\" that attracted me back.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIdk, thanks for reading though, I just wanted to write this out for someone to read.", "subreddit": "NarcissisticAbuse"}

I honestly really enjoy when a teacher will put their hand on my shoulder when helping me and situations similar. For example one time my dad was touching my shoulder and i said please stop or something and he then started to pet my shoulder over and over like a cat, saying \u201cIm just touching you.\u201d. If my mother is present when this happens she justifies my dads behavior. I say stop, or if after a while of having my boundaries pushed i lash out she tells me to stop being rude, i'm being ridiculous, i need to stop, it's not that big of a deal, stop being so aggressive, my dad backing everything she's saying up. Both threatening me. She once told me i don't need to say stop so rudely. Every time i think about it it takes me aback, how the fuck can someone say something like that. I told her stop means stop, i don't need to say it politely, i shouldn't even need to say it more than once. No just means no. i don't have to justify my boundaries. Just because they're different from yours doesn't mean they're wrong or you don't have to respect them. i was talking to someone once about this, i was asking him if he had any insight on why it still makes me so uncomfortable. I mean, you'd think after having your boundaries pushed your whole life it wouldn't bother you so much after a while. He told me its because despite my efforts to make boundaries for myself they have continued to be pushed and not respected. Sorry, using Reddit as a diary. ", "subreddit": "emotionalabuse"}

To begin, I didn't know what I was getting myself into, I had a three bedroom apartment leased, with one room being leased out to one of the greatest friends I've ever had, the second was vacant.  I had lived with this person in our student dormitory and he kept mostly to himself and usually went with the flow so I agreed to live with him.  Shortly after moving in, things began to change for the worse.  Due to a series of other unfortunate events, I was already on edge from a long summer and a change in environment didn't help things either.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe person in discussion I believe exhibits signs of narcissism, through extreme dramatization, blaming others for his issues, substance abuse, belittling others feelings, etc.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI had a great relationship with my other roommate, and during a time of despair, the narcissist in my life prevailed to be someone there in support of me. Unfortunately, I threw that friendship away, partially because I felt betrayal from them, and also narcissistic tendencies in them as well.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAt first, it was minor, it began with his disapproval of the amount that one roommate had someone over, using the utilities, etc that was painted in my mind. It further progressed to him expressing his \"dominance\" over everything, feeling and acting like he was entitled to whatever he wanted as long as it wasn't locked behind our doors. He would lash out in anger and dump water on people's personal belongings, such as one of our mutual friends 3000 dollar laptop. It;s now progressed to where he blames me for everything, says I can't act like an adult, that I can't do a ob correctly, etc. It's honestly something thats starting to take its toll on me, and I can't escape it since I am forced to live here as long as me lease is valid.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSome of my favorite stories he has told me / performed before:\n\n1. He one time tried to lock the 3rd roommate out of the apartment because he did not approve of him having a guest over.\n2. \"I only blocked you on everything because I could hear your voice and I was already in a bad mood, and you pissed me off\"\n3. He one time told his friends that I would pay for their room and board on a leisure trip.\n4. He over dramatizes things to get people to pay attention, he would wait for me to come home so he could leave his room and complain about his day.\n\nI can think of at least 20 more things to put but I'll spare it unless its further requested.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhile it was slow at first, it is now more apparent than ever.  Constantly, I am forced into the confines of my room, without ready access to food or water and stuck laying in bed most of the day.  He treats me like a child and inflicts his reign with access to weapons in his room, random outbursts, constant anger issues such as punching walls, etc.  I feel as if I can't breathe anymore in this apartment. I'll leave a link down in the comments to a note he left on the door but I don't want to make it seem like I am trying to rant.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nPeople who have experienced this before, how did you get by day to day and how did you finally start to heal.  I honestly feel like a liability for my friends and I don't want them to think they are babysitting me. Additionally, I am starting to feel like less of a human everyday, as I haven't left my room for more than short periods in over two months, and I just want to find a healthy outlet to put my time and energy into.

For a long time I have felt terribly ashamed of myself and unable to truly break free of emotional abuse. It was becoming so bad and so pervasive that it was turning me into someone I didn't like.\n\nThankfully over the past week or so I have come to the realisation that this does NOT have to be the 'new normal' for me. That it is within my right to set boundaries, say no and let go of trauma bonding, even if the abuser has put themselves at risk. It is not up to me to rescue them or feel sorry for them and this does NOT make me a bad person.\n\nI am sleeping much better, and though I still have tremendous agony to overcome, it is so much easier 'going alone' than trying to elicit love, comfort and understanding from my abuser. I know you guys don't know me personally, but just reading some of your posts has validated my feelings and made me feel understood in a way that I couldn't before. I am constantly told by others that my family 'did their best' (when I know full well - NO THEY DID NOT!).\n\nAnyway I'll leave it here, thank you for creating the safe space to use this forum as a daily diary / reminder to push through anxiety and self doubt, and to take care of myself. To everyone going through a really difficult time, my heart goes out to you and I wish you the strength and courage to just keep going one day at a time.", "subreddit": "emotionalabuse"}

I moved in with him not long after we had gotten back together (less than a month) and after a bit he started getting physical (started when I told him his mom smokes drugs in the apartment with me home) so I forgave him for that but it still continued. It didn\u2019t happen too often but when it did it was always physical. \nWell now we have a 16 month old together and things still haven\u2019t changed. He\u2019s gotten meaner it\u2019s happening more frequently. \nNot long after I had given birth to our son he was calling me fat (I was only 120 pounds) so of course me I stopped eating and lost the weight (I weight about 110 now, when I got pregnant I was 95 pounds)  \nSo a few months ago he starts talking about how I need to eat more because my bones are sticking out (I can\u2019t eat what I want because he complains it\u2019s not good enough eg. pop tarts, salad, etc..) basically if he doesn\u2019t like it I can\u2019t eat it. \nWell this morning everything was going fine then he got mad at me because I didn\u2019t get up to make our son a boiled egg (my sons never eaten eggs regardless of who gives him it) so my bf put it on the oven then started yelling at me because my sons high chair tray was a bit dirty from the night before. I refused to clean it (why must I do everything?) he started yelling at me calling me names, keep in mind our son was around during all the abuse since he was born. \nI had walked past him and he punched me in the arm as I was walking past him. Alright whatever. Then he starts telling my son that I\u2019m a piece of shit mother, and that our sons going to grow up to hate me. (There\u2019s a lot more to explain but trying to keep it simple) \nSo I get my son and myself ready to go for a walk (he\u2019s refusing to let me leave with him, but he didn\u2019t get physical this time when we left) we walked down the street to use McDonald\u2019s wifi to call my mom to come pick us up. She does. My bf starts messaging me so I decide to message his dad and see if maybe he could help. Well.. apparently it didn\u2019t.. it made things worse. He sent me pictures of my clothes in bags threatening to throw them out along with posting things on FB about me. \n\nBasically what I\u2019m trying to accomplish here is wtf do I do? I\u2019m so lost I don\u2019t know what to do. I have no girlfriends to talk to and I\u2019m trying not to talk to my mom about it so much because I know it hurts her (she told me once she wish I had enough self respect to leave him.. \ud83d\udc94\ud83d\ude22) \nI\u2019m alright during the day it\u2019s just the nights that kill me.. and I don\u2019t have my own room at my parents so it\u2019s not like I can listen to music and cry myself to sleep.

I'm truly shocked they feel it warrants removal because of that, but feel that the mods are sometimes too quick to remove posts.\n\nTL;DR I started dating \"Tom\" (32m) last month and despite being immediately infatuated with him, it feels as if something is not quite right. We just had a \"meet the friends\" weekend which ended up with me drunk and crying on the train home. I'm wondering if this is salvageable or if I should throw the whole man away.\n\nI have a birth defect (club foot) for which I wear a leg brace. The type of silicone material my leg brace is made out of looks similar to a prosthetic so invariably I have to deal with comments every year from the students I work with (secondary school teenagers) asking if I have a fake leg. I try to be open about it and laugh about myself so I generally reply, 'I'm not a pirate!' or some other nonsense and then explain that I have issues with my ankle. I don't mind the students asking questions, and I try to answer them as best I can, but I feel as if I might be a bit sensitive when the questions/comments come from adults.\n\nI'm trying to wrap my head round some of the comments Tom has made. Each time he feels he has made them in jest but I have quite literally stopped in my tracks to tell him to be nice to me/that he's being mean. He laughs them off and I feel as if maybe I'm being too sensitive.\n\n* The students asking me about my fake leg came up in conversation and I said I might as well make the most of it for Hallowe'en and invest in an eye patch and a parrot. Tom started making comments about my peg leg.\n* 'Run Forest! Run!' as we are hurrying up the stairs, trying to make our train\n* Calling me a cripple/crippled as we are trying to walk fast to meet his friends when I said I was in pain\n* Referring to me as 'Hop-a-long'\n* Whilst at the bar with his friends, telling me to 'waddle' to the bar (his friends heard and told him off for his verb choice)\n\nSome other things that have happened over the past weekend, that occurred repeatedly:\n\n* Grabbing my ass waiting for/on the train when I've stated I don't like that kind of PDA\n* Shoving his hands down the back of my pants whilst my friends were nearby\n* Literally poking me in the asshole whilst my friends were nearby\n* Shoving his cold hands up my shirt in front of my friends to make me scream\n* Poking me hard in the face/sides with a toothpick until I took it away from him\n* Making moo-ing noises at me and making jokes about me being a cow\n\nI had to have a conversation with him a couple of weeks ago regarding the way he speaks to me because I feel that he is rude at times. For instance, in the past he has told me I'm being a \"fucking idiot\" or \"fucking stupid\" for bringing up things he believes are incorrect (ie. he called me \"fucking stupid\" for stating that tomatoes aren't European in origin - which they aren't). He has amended the way he speaks to me, but I feel that I shouldn't have to tell a 32 year old man that calling someone \"fucking stupid\" is not an appropriate way to talk to someone you are dating. If I say something that he feel is incorrect now he makes a show of biting his lip, averts his eyes and just nods along.\n\nAfter seeing his friends off on Saturday night, we started wandering around the train station attempting to find the correct platform to get home. I was no help as I was very intoxicated. I'm not quite sure what he said to me as my memory of the journey home is very spotty because of the amount of alcohol I drank, but I started crying on the train and was very upset. I ignored him for the first part of the journey home but then apologised because I couldn't stop crying. Eventually, when we got back to mine I ended up full on sobbing into his chest and we ended up having sex.\n\nI woke up with a killer hangover, made worse because of my embarrassment from the day before. He wouldn't touch or really look at me, just made some polite conversation. When I dropped him off at the train station for his journey home he said that the plans we had made for the following weekend were probably not a good idea and that he was going to have to have a think about continuing to see me. I apologised for the way I dealt with being upset and that it was an embarrassing situation to put him in on the train in public. He just nodded and thanked me for the apology, then got out of the car.\n\nTL;DR I'm trying to determine whether it is worth reaching out and trying to apologise to Tom or if my self esteem is so non-existent that I'm putting up with him treating me terribly.

This is the second time I've left him. I made the mistake of not blocking his phone number the first time, which was three months ago.

I don't know if he is going to reach out in similar ways. I am not strong enough right now to believe I could just walk away if he were to stand in front of me.

All too often. During the times when I was given this look, I wanted to do anything and everything to get him to look at me how he \"used to\" (in the first few months of our relationship). This blank look he would give me when I was upset, when I confronted him about his behavior and how he made me feel bad, it was frightening. He looked at me with this stare that could haunt me for the rest of my life. There was no emotion in his eyes, no love, not even hate. Nothing. Just emptiness. It was when he gave me that look that I truly saw him for what he was - a shell of a human. And I STILL immediately would think \"I want him to love me, what can I do to get him to love me again.\" \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm sickened that he looked at me that way.

When I first joined when it was a small group of 9 people, put together by her friends, she was very compassionate and always talked about how she wanted to be better than the group she left, which was led by a \"complete b-tch\" as she put it. They were fun to play with, and everything seemed fine.\nIt all got a bit off putting when one of their friends with depression was going through some distress, and the line \"I hope he gets better soon\" was said, but she never reached out to them to comfort them. Only times she would address it is when he came in drunk and looking for someone to talk to, or when he wasn't performing well in game when she was in the party. He eventually left and stood up for himself and openly said \"You guys only care about yourselves\" and hasn't said a word since.\nEver since then the group has gotten pretty large, and there has been constant instances of her being nice and bubbly when people came in, but wouldn't say a word to them unless it was something like a picture or praise to her that could make her and \"her group\" as she called it look good. I've stuck around long enough to be praised, pushed away from the friend group, and basically told when I would bring anything up that she would perceive as being her fault that it's all in my head or I'm being too sensitive.\nI've also noticed she would not say anything or post anything when I'm around, praise anyone, especially anyone who is attractive, and basically treat them as if they were Barbie dolls that she could pair up to hook up or get into a relationship with each other.\nAt this point I've lost my position with all the original members of this group, any outward respect of those who she talks to in her private channels, and any chance to prove I'm not some failure she tries to make me out to be with her quips about mistakes I made months ago but will never be forgotten, even if I openly tried to get better. I don't want to lose contact with the people I enjoy talking with, but at the same time I've realized I need to separate myself from them for my own mental health.\nWhat can I do to try to not let this person separate me completely from these people I genuinely care for and want to still be in contact with?", "subreddit": "NarcissisticAbuse"}

That he was 'broody' for children (to add I was not in that position but I assumed this was his way of telling me how serious he was about this - he knew I wouldn't commit in any way this time around if he wasn't showing he was at least serious), and wanted the whole shebang.

I didn't know where else to post, because I can't specifically find \"stalker victim\" on reddit for some reason or I'm just such a newbie.\n\nAnyway, for one, I'm not from the US... I'll just say I'm in a country where it's harder to get any help from the police compared to in the US, especially for stalking cases. Also, where I'm from, cellphone numbers are NOT regulated (no need to register.... prepaid sims are being used and disposed of all the time here).\n\nHere's what happened. Somebody called a family member. She told me he immediately said \"is this Amelia (let's just say that's my name)?\" in a loud voice. She replied, \"It's her (family member) who is this and what's your business calling?\" He said \"it's John, so is this Amelia?\" \n\nConfused, she thought it was one of my workplace's clients or from the bank or whatever, so she told him she doesn't know a John and that she'll just leave a message. But, she also specifically said she isn't Amelia and he probably got the wrong number.\n\nShe called me immediately after, naturally, asking me who is john cos he was looking for me. I wasn't too concerned... I told her that's probably from this or that establishment etc or a customer etc and to just give me his number. Because I do know a few with that name!\n\nHowever, she called back later to tell me more. Apparently he called her back... she kept telling him she's not amelia and he probably got the wrong number.\n\nConvinced that he \"knew\" it was Amelia, he told her \"look, I know you remember me, I've changed, I now work for the government etc, I've changed... this is serious.\" Note: \"THIS IS SERIOUS\" - WHY would that matter at all to a person he suddenly calls, unsolicited (dont know if that's the right word), after 15 long years?? (Will explain that part later).\n\nConfused, my sis kept asking questions like where is he calling from, etc and that if he's in the government, maybe she'll be the one to go see him there so that maybe they can sort out some papers or whatever reason there is as to why he was calling.\n\nPerhaps because of all the questions and going around in circles he finally admitted his real name!\n\nHe said \"ok ok actually it's Philip...\" and she said he started sharing things and his name rang a bell for her. \n\nThat's because he was my ex from more than a decade ago! About 15 years ago! \n\nIm talking about boyfriend/girlfriend (we lasted only a few months because there really was something WRONG with him - insecure, possessive, suggested bizzare things etc). \n\nWhen she realized who he was, she amped up her supposed \"cluelessness\" and told him she has no idea what he's talking about and she mistook him for someone else thinking he was asking for payment or some bank or work requirements. \n\nAccording to her he kept blabbing on because he insists she was me so she pretended that someone was calling her from across the room and put the phone down.\n\nHe texted her after that saying he knows it's Amelia, the Amelia he knew 15 years ago. She kept replying to him she mistook him for someone else and sorry he got the wrong number. He sent only maybe 6 messages back and forth replying... until he finally said \"ok maybe this really is the wrong number sorry.\" But in a subtly sarcastic way implying that he knows it's me but \"whatever if you say so\" (cant quite describe in my mother tongue).\n\nWhat concerns me now is some of the things he texted. First, he was like, \"are you married now? I know it's you, it's what it says in your form. I saw your photos though...\" (where?? What photos?? I'll never know!!!). EDIT: all my social media is PRIVATE (altho I have social media for business, I am generallt a PRIVATE person). I dont know though if I have inadvertently allowed a friend to tag me on his/her Public post so maybe that could be a problem!\n\nShe texted him (pretending that her number was being used wrongly on someone else's form) \"uh, what name is on that form?\" He texted back my entire full name along with other personal info that I know even he wouldn't know. I mean heck I don't even know or remember his middle name so how can he remember mine unless of course he does indeed have a completed form in front of him.\n\nThat is also my concern. A government employee, him, is using personal information. He calls out of the blue and even when it wasn't actually me who answered the phone, and despite being told that was not me, he still typed out my full name and personal information thru text. Also he didn't even have the decency to properly introduce himself first because going ahead asking if it was me. \n\nEspecially in my countru, it is RUDE not to first say, \"I'm sorry for disturbing you but....\" also the fact that he first lied about his name... doesn't that show that he wanted to control the situation and make sure it was ME?! Doesn't that indicate that he in fact knew I would have just put the phone down or ignored him or pretended to be someone else, but despite knowing that he still wanted to force me to speak with him?\n\nHe was and is so stupid (and I mean it literally, like uneducated), but I think stupid and crazy is way worse than smart and crazy. At least if the person is smart, you can make deals with them or they know what's good for them when threatened. A stupid and crazy person can continue to do dangerous things despite being warned (like threatened with jail time etc) until maybe they are killed cos their victim did self defense or shot by police.\n\nNow I'm at a loss as to how to actually take this. Am I overreacting, is he just being a wierdo (a safe wierdo)... or could this turn into something way worse? \n\nShould I wait and if he no longer contacts me or anyone I know should I stop being worried? Was it just a case of... oh wow, \"this is my ex's info on this form I should call her\" or is it more of, I should call her cos I think I still got a chance? After 15 years though?!! Is there something mentally wrong with him has he worsened if he does have a mental health issue?\n\nJust other info, in the few months we were together 15 years ago, he never actually hit me or was physically abusive. However, he did pull my arm a few times when he wanted to ask something \"urgent,\" he did say and do some things that I now realize were red flags... when I had another argument with my dad for instance and confided in him (I was really young that time!), he suggested to me at one point... would you want me to have someone take care of him I know a lot of people you know? (Well, even when I said Out of teenage angst that I wished he disappeared, he never did anything thank goodness).\n\nI didn't take him that seriously that time because he was always full of air and trying to act tough even when he wasn't! For instance he'd say stuff like \"You went to that club? I hate clubs. I'd bomb that club you went to. I'm serious. My dad has some grenades. He has ties to the military.\" He said those kinds of things ALL the time. Plus he'd tell me to go home at a certain time (really early) every single day. Then he slowly suggested what i should wear etc. When we were out, he'd tell me, \"did you see that guy just check you out? I took a long hard look at him... he sure as hell got scared!\"\n\nIn real life he was scrawny although had abs, but he was scrawnier than me and I'm by all means not even chubby. Im a small size all my life, and people often wondered what I saw in him. He was pretty ugly too with an ugly attitude. Looking back I was infatuated cos he knows how to charm (at first) and im actually not a shallow person even til now I mostly care about the person's attitude.... \n\n...but looking back I just cant help but realize he was overly insecure.. im just stating facts here that his physical attributes while probably not the whole reason, also contributed to his insecurity (im not gonna be politically correct about that!). Cos I mean his whole family actually kinda looked good... he would be the epitome of what \"ugly duckling\" means. And I always felt that he knew that... but besides that, he was always a little loopy/weird/passive aggressive.\n\nAnyway later on In the relationship I would feel he actually lies a lot or there was something about him that I felt he was hiding or like he had an agenda. I now even remember him making fun of me but when asked him what do you mean he said \"Nah I was talking about a friend\" but I know he was talking about me! He did that when he didn't like what I was doing or if I didn't go with his ideas or suggestions or if I had my own opinion of things.\n\nI did not stay long enough with him to know if he is indeed THAT kind of dangerous or if he is just one of those intellectually/emotionally stunted guys who can't move on from an ex even after several years.\n\nI contacted communications govt agency abt this in writing, BUT, Im already guessing all theyre going tell me is BLOCK his number.\n\nAnd I don't have any further evidence that he is harassing me except for those textes with my family member. \n\nBut what about him, a government employee, using personal information to contact the individual who filled out the form? Is that not illegal? If it is... HOW am I going to trace his number without being caught by him and especially that the number is likely prepaid or even just an online disposable number?\n\nThere is also the fact that his family is supposedly well connected (only proof I had was his parents had photos with known politicians). They don't seem to have a lot of money but their posessions are questionable based on their assumed income (I won't say what their work is but you get the point). \n\nTo give you an idea, let's say this person has a small house... not a nice looking house but a house nonetheless while everyone else is struggling to pay rent. And this person just has a local non-profit org. While they don't have \"luxury\" stuff... things just don't connect.\n\nThat's just one of the reasons why I broke up with him a long time ago. His background is dodgy. His parents LOOKED normal but they seem like the type who know they have a psycho child but don't want to admit it. And they also seem like your typical con artists. You know, types who go to church but are something else after Sundays.\n\nPlease help me where to start. Even I'm scared to contact police because what if the info reaches him... then he can confirm wow, my (family member) actually knows me and now he can come after me!\n\nSorry this is so long. I never knew I would be in this position. I thought it only happened to other people or in movies. There are also not many well known stalking cases in my country nor is it talked about much! Forget about \"restraining order\" nobody here would probably even know what that means :(\n\nI do have an SO. I'm a home buddy so every time I'm out he's usually with me... that or im with a friend just for coffee or whatever.. I don't go clubbing anymore and if I do it's withba group usually and I always go home with the same company. We also generally dont stay out late IF we even go out anymore. I also don't have a fixed schedule as my job allows me to work from home or choose a schedule most times. Are these enough? Is this uncertainty really gonna be my life now?", "subreddit": "abuse"}

Yes, I\u2019m hurt and upset.  I am afraid I\u2019m dramatic and or cause drama..\n\nYes, I did want to be his \u2018focus\u2019 and I wanted his attention... because I really, really enjoyed spending time with him.   I feel like I wasn\u2019t respecting his boundaries.. because I knew he needed space and alone time..\n\nI guess I caused drama because I would get upset and there were times where I cried during arguments... because I was really hurt... I just wanted a relationship with him.  \n\nHe was on Hinge IN FRONT OF ME, and I had never heard of it, and I was like what\u2019s that?  \u201cOh it\u2019s just an app to meet people and make friends\u201d - of course I found out later it wasn\u2019t.. I feel like I wasn\u2019t respecting his boundaries again..\n\nI supposedly crossed boundaries with him... by asking why we couldn\u2019t hang out in and evening - I was told \u201cI don\u2019t need to tell you anything\u201d (because he was going on a date with someone else - and of course when I said \u2018if you\u2019re doing something that is going to be detrimental to my health, yes, you do actually owe me an explanation)... he insists he apologized - he didn\u2019t.

I lost it, I was so angry and hurt and felt so betrayed.

Later in the day,I forgot my stuff there and went back to his place to get it (after he kept ignoring my phone calls), in his mind I just showed up waiting for him - I tried to call or tell you like an adult, but you ignored me trying to tell you.  We had an enormous blow up, where I was so angry and hurt that when I left I slammed his door hard enough to break it.  I feel like maybe I was the one crazy-making..\n\nTexting other women in front of me... but of course it\u2019s my anxiety and me overthinking, because it was his family.  When I side eyed his phone and told him I had a problem with him doing that, because he knows my feelings for him... cue another giant fight.

I feel like there are so many out there who have it worse than me or have had it worse than me, I don't deserve to even say that I am messed up over the things that I have gone through with my Nex. Who am I to have these issues? It's just attention seeking, so many people have it worse. I just need to suck it up and keep it moving. Legitimately these are the things I think. But then I have situations like last night that really shake me up. \n\nI was play wrestling with my boyfriend (who is absolutely wonderful by the way) and he got me in a choke hold. He was not choking me, or even holding me tightly. He was just holding me in a way that I knew he had won that round if we had really been wrestling. The problem is, my Nex did jiu jitsu and would resort to choking me sometimes when we would get into physical fights. There were a good number of times that I sincerely questioned whether or not he was going to kill me by doing this. He had made me pass out once before, and he just seemed to lose control when his temper flared like that. So last night, even though I could have easily gotten out of the \"hold\" my boyfriend had on me, I panicked. I started breathing heavily, and got the same feeling of panic I used to get with my Nex when he held me like that. Of course my boyfriend picked up on it, and immediately stopped and asked if I was okay. But instead of explaining what I was feeling, I just brushed it off and kept wrestling with him. I just felt like I did not deserve to sit there and tell him I was full of fear and shaken up---and he doesn't deserve to have to clean up the mess that my Nex made. He would, I'm sure, be understanding and supportive and loving. My boyfriend knows I was in an abusive relationship and he knows it did me some real damage, but that's all he knows. I won't let him in on instances like last night, because I just don't feel like it's his problem and that I should just suck it up and keep it moving. \n\nI mean, at a certain point we have to move past this kinda stuff, right? I'm obviously strong enough to go through some of the stuff I went through, so I don't need to start acting weak when things flash me back to the stuff I went through.   \nI hope this made sense, I just didn't know how to articulate what was going on in my head in relation to this stuff. Does anyone else feel this way? Like, that you don't deserve to struggle? Or that it isn't someone else's problem? I just feel broken when I think of myself like that, and I don't want to feel broken or feel like I have baggage. Everyone has issues.

I don't think it was a societal \"touching yourself is bad\" thing, because I was so young that I don't think I even knew what it was. I used to make my Barbie dolls have sex a lot. I drew naked women a lot and when I got a bit older tried to draw sex a lot too (I say tried cos I was like 10 and didn't actually know what sex really entailed, so I doubt it was anatomically accurate lol).  Dunno if this is relevant, but I think I had a bladder infection around 6 too.\n\nWhen I was around 8/9 I accidentally found porn (not really porn, but a channel with women with their boobs out on it) and started masturbating to that quite often. When I got to 12/13 I remember really wanting to have sex and being very sexually aware. I would go on public webcam chats and show strangers my vagina (but not my face). When I was 13/14 I was very sexually curious and didn't shy away from anything that involved sexual touching, but it was all with people my own age and I don't really consider it as a bad thing, it was consensual. I would go on sites like chat roulette with my friend and we would do strip teases for the people watching us (at like 15) and a few months after I tried to get into camming and did a naked webcam show for someone in the hopes of getting paid (I didn't). I posted a lot of naked photos of myself on the internet at 15 and had a twitter account dedicated to it. After all of these instances though, I would feel really bad afterwards and drink to feel less shit about it. \n\nI've had a lot of mental health issues. I started compulsively pulling my hair out at 9 which left me with a bald patch, self harming at 11, and starving /purging at 12, which developed into full blown anorexia by the time I was 13. I started smoking and drinking when I was 12, and by 14/15 was smoking and drinking on a daily basis (as long as I could find the means to, which was pretty much always). I tried to kill myself around 20 times from the ages of 13-15, and severely self harmed until I was 16. Took drugs alot, etc. You get the gist. \n\nI started having \"risky\" sex at 15 (taking drugs, going to hotels away from my hometown and having unprotected sex). Then, I went through a period of around 2 years where sex disgusted me and I seriously thought I was asexual for a while because the idea of someone touching me in that way again made me feel sick. \n\nWhen I was 17, I went through a phase where I had a couple of one night stands and wanted to do whatever it took to feel like the guy really \"wanted\" me. I got with my current partner at 18, and he's amazing, but we had a rough patch in the first couple of months because if we didn't have sex I felt like I wasn't good enough and that it was because he wasn't attracted to me (have since sorted this, we talk a lot about issues). \n\nSince I was 12, I've had this weird thing with my nipples where, if they are stimulated, I feel suicidal. That sounds like an exaggeration but it's really weird and hard to explain, I basically just feel a sum of guilt and disgust and it's very odd. \n\nI go through phases of wanting to be completely degraded when I have sex, and hating it and it making me feel disgusting and guilty (sometimes within the same sex session, which makes things awkward). \n\nI'm not trying to insinuate anything here, btw, if it turns out these are completely normal behaviours that's calm. I just want an opinion because I've never told anyone this before. It often feels like I had a very fucked up adolescence and view of sex, but for no apparent reason. \n\nThe only thing I've ever thought of that might be considered weird is that I used to suck on my mum's nipples as a child (up until around 6, I think) and felt very embarrassed by it, but it wasn't like she forced me to do it, so idk. Again, not insinuating anything, just a suggestion because I genuinely otherwise can't think of anything.\n\nI've never told anyone this because I feel like I have no explanation for it.

They claim they apologized for the what the fuck, and luckily their lack of confrontation/conflict management skills pays off Bc their is no text/message/email to back up - you call them out on that too.\n\nIdk what this is called lol - You told them that they make you feel scared and in return they say they \u201chear you\u201d and only for some sick way for them to sneak in (steal your words specifically) to describe how you are making them feel because now you are the \u201caggressive\u201d one. \n\nLike being upset at the reactive abuse response is one thing...but I have a feeling she figured out that there was validity to what I was saying and that she had to back peddle. And fast.  Forgetting (again not listening/attentively reading) that I specifically said those exact words to her (not the other way around) and she said \u201cI hear you, I understand, I\u2019m sorry\u201d to them just to turn around and use those terms herself. To come out the victim. It\u2019s a damn joke.\n\nThis person said I make her feel unsafe taking to me...UNSAFE. I\u2019m flabbergasted. I asked her how and she never responded with an answer. I asked a couple more times, and still no response. She then shifted to saying that I was *mean* (yes she used the *) to emphasis. I wasn\u2019t being mean, I was telling her a hard truth. She was accusing me of being \u201cresentful\u201d of her relationship with her bf...someone she gotten into at least 10 very big and dramatic fights with and him threatening to leave her because of her behavior towards him - in the span of 2.5 years. Don\u2019t accuse me of that. That man has one foot out the door. It\u2019s only mean because it\u2019s the truth, since she prefers a lie.\n\nI\u2019m confused at how much short term memory/playing dumb can actually propel someone to be this out of touch with reality. I\u2019m dead serious when I say that this is the most obvious sign of an emotionally abusive person. I would tell that to someone else. But I can\u2019t say it to myself.\n\nAnd I\u2019m sitting here today after 1 week of NC, wondering what I did wrong to make her behave this way. \n\nAnyway.

My counselor confirmed to me that his behaviors do match that of someone with NPD. I sent one of his exes some info/resources I had found about the disorder that I found enlightening/healing. She confirmed my suspicion that he was a narc (she had been with him for 5+ years) and said she had even confronted him about it at some point. She said his response was anger and denial. He is very intelligent/well read/well informed so I really can't believe that he is unaware of his disorder or at least his manipulations. We are not really together at this point, its complicated but I can clearly see he is the ruin of my equilibrium/balance. I am still desperately attached and want to make it work.  I feel like I am always scheming as to how I can be with him even knowing that he has this neurosis.  I have been drafting a letter to him to inform him of the NPD and the behaviors/manipulations/tactics he used/uses  and that they are all out in the open now, that he can't hide what he is anymore. I really believe that he wants to have meaningful relationships. I truly feel like he is capable of connecting on a deeper level but has always been in relationships that feed his narcissistic brain rather than trying to understand and reprogram it. I think like me both his past exes enabled the manipulations by believing we were the crazy ones and by crawling back for more abuse. We never tried to break the patterns because the trauma bond was so deep and he IS so gorgeous and charming and the love bombing is the best ever best love. It's all painfully addictive. The other exes and I perpetuated the disorder by always taking fault and never calling out his devilish complacency and down right dastardly deeds. Anyway, am I silly to think that if I write this letter in a way that is non accusatory and non blaming (he is after all a victim of his neuroses) that he might think about going in for some behavioral therapy? Has anyone elses N/NEx tried therapy? Is it a general belief that the N is a lost cause? Are there any hopefully folks out there ?", "subreddit": "NarcissisticAbuse"}

I\u2019ve posted a couple times the past couple days and I\u2019m struggling with a lot right now so I\u2019ll just condense it all into one post this time. This is all over the place but it\u2019s a few thoughts I\u2019ve been having and reflecting on. Does anyone else feel this way because for the first time in months, after months of not caring enough to be sad and just being angry, I\u2019m feeling everything all over again. For context, discard with my soon-to-be nex wife happened 11 months ago. We have been mostly NC since July minus her texting me once and me replying and letting it all out (which falls on deaf ears, I know, but it was still therapeutic and I did it for myself). I started talking to someone else four months ago and...\n\n**It happened again and I feel disposable.** When the new narc discarded over text this weekend, I said \u201cis it that easy to just cut me off?\u201d Their reply: \u201cobviously it isn\u2019t because I like you but I love myself.\u201d As if I\u2019m detrimental to them. My nex said the exact same thing. That she can\u2019t love me and love herself at the same time. That she needed to be free and that she can\u2019t do that with me in her life and that she can\u2019t be happy when she\u2019s with me. She literally called it self-care. Leaving me is self-care. That\u2019s her words and having it reinforced hurt so much. \n\nI never lashed out at at my nex. I never called her names. I never screamed at her. She did all of those things. She was detrimental to *my* mental health. I know it\u2019s projecting. But I still find it so hard to silence those thoughts in my head telling me that she\u2019s right and it\u2019s all true. I feel disposable and that I\u2019m a hazard to everyone I know. It\u2019s so easy for people to throw me away. My best friends who have been through abusive relationships themselves are telling me that none of it is true and that I\u2019m not the abuser, they know my nex and saw her abuse long before I did and know she\u2019s in the wrong. But I still feel like the problem and that they love me so they\u2019re biased and I keep believing it anyway. And now someone else who I was involved with has just reinforced everything my nex said. \n\n**Do you ever just get that really empty feeling in your chest?** I don\u2019t know how else to describe it. That feeling where you\u2019re both numb and completely broken all at once. I work in a call center and have to listen to myself talk 24/7 all day and I can hear it in my voice when I feel like this. I feel like a shell of a person and like I\u2019m on autopilot. I haven\u2019t felt it this strongly since the few months after discard. Hearing my nex\u2019s words from someone else and being triggered in that way has brought it all back. It hurts so much. I physically feel the emptiness in my chest and it\u2019s the strangest feeling but it\u2019s there and I can\u2019t ignore it. I feel empty and just so exhausted. \n\n**Why are they so fucking addictive?** I know my nex is bad for me, and that this new narc was probably too, but I miss them both. I get too attached to the wrong people. I have no boundaries and when people say to set boundaries, I don\u2019t even know where to start or what that means. I grew up with a narc dad and I\u2019ve dealt with this shit my whole life. I know it\u2019s bad for me, and yet that magnetic energy and the love-bombing is like a drug and makes me want to stay and I stop caring how unhealthy it is to have them in my life and on my bad days I start missing my nex - the high of it all when her mask was on and I didn\u2019t realize who she really was. This hurts so much and I can\u2019t believe I fell into this again. It ripped the band aid right off and I feel everything again and that maybe it\u2019s me and that I\u2019m not good enough and there\u2019s something wrong with me, that everything they said is right and I mess everything up and I deserve it. I know, somewhere deep down, that it isn\u2019t true. But logic means nothing to the heart and everything else in me is telling me that it is true and it hurts so much. \n\nThe trauma bond is so fucking real and I can\u2019t let go of it. It\u2019s like a drug. The lows and the highs and that magnetic feeling they give off that sucks you right in are like a drug and I know it\u2019s terrible for me and I miss it. I miss my nex and I miss the new narc because she distracted me from the pain of missing my nex. Which isn\u2019t healthy at all and I shouldn\u2019t have thrown myself into this situation before healing, and now it hurts twice as much after being burned again. \n\nI hope this makes sense. I\u2019ve been a mess the last few days so I\u2019m kind of all over the place and I\u2019m trying to reflect as much as I can. I have PTSD and I\u2019m having triggers from other things going on in my personal life in addition to this. It\u2019s so much. I scheduled an appointment later this week with an old therapist that I saw for 2 years during my relationship with my nex and for a couple months after discard. She knows my history so I feel like seeing her will really help. God knows I need it. I have so much to fix and right now it just hurts missing someone who doesn\u2019t give you a second thought at all. As I was writing this I was thinking \u201cyikes\u201d the entire time because I realize just how much this has damaged me, how much I\u2019m talking down on myself and how much work I need to, how terrible this all sounds. I\u2019m sorry if it sounds like a pity party or overdramatic. I\u2019m feeling so much all at once and I haven\u2019t felt like this in months.

Back in high school, he was awkward socially but we also partied a lot so I didn\u2019t know him too well on a deep, personal level. Having reconnected with him as an adult, here are the things that are standing out for me as red flags: \n\n- He talks endlessly. Just on and on and on, not bothering to consider if I\u2019m interested in what he\u2019s saying, not checking to see if I\u2019m bored. He goes into minute detail that only he would ever care about, and he never just gets to the point. Doesn\u2019t reciprocate, just TALKS. \n- Anything that I say, he comes back with something similar that happened to him. I divulged a very personal, traumatic thing to him and he literally asked me NO questions about it and expressed NO concern. He immediately launched into something similar that happened to him. \n- He is very self-righteous. He has a black-or-white opinion on everything and he will just tell you. He seems to care more about being right and being \u201cabove\u201d others than anything else. \n- There is a strange childlike quality to him. It\u2019s like he gets overly excited by everything, giddy like a child would, but he holds people to extremely high standards and when people don\u2019t meet his expectations, he gets sullen and quiet and silently shuns the \u201coffender\u201d. \n- He has very rigid routines and does NOT like to come out of his comfort zone. He can\u2019t just let go. Everything has to be planned and under his control. \n- He acts like he owns people and like he has the right to judge them however he wants, but as soon as he\u2019s called out on his own behavior or shortcomings, he gets angry and contemptuous of the other person. \n- He over-idealizes women (including me). He sent me a letter years after high school telling me that he had always had a huge crush on me. In the letter were lots of little details about things that happened when we spent time together, things that I had no recollection of. It\u2019s like he had this whole fantasy of me in his head the entire time, none of which he actually took action on.\n- He is overbearing and intense to the point of being exhausting. With the constant talking, over-enthusiasm and lack of proper social boundaries, I literally cannot wait to get away from him nearly every time I interact with him. \n- He has facial tics where he awkwardly blinks a lot and makes strange facial grimaces. He\u2019s also very twitchy, fidgety, and jerky. This one I\u2019m not sure is connected with narcissism or not. Maybe indicative of Asperger\u2019s? \n\nThe thing is, he can be nice and he\u2019s very sensitive, but he doesn\u2019t seem to have ANY concept of other people and his behavior is draining and smothering to me. I find myself feeling very angry and resentful at the fact that he seems to use me as an audience for his monologues, like I\u2019m his mother or something, just supposed to sit there and nod my head and agree with everything he says.", "subreddit": "NarcissisticAbuse"}

I keep having repeating dreams of sexual nature involving my mom or aunt (who lived with me my whole childhood). These dreams are extremely disturbing and make me feel like crap. I definitely do NOT have any kind of sexual attraction towards my mother or my aunt. I do have, however, sort of a sexual trauma (or a series of traumas) regarding them.\n\nBasically sex was a topic in the house ever since I was very young - as young as six years old. I was very curious about sex specifically and would ask my mom and aunt lots of weird questions, my aunt would answer them joyfully, my mom kinda avoided them. But I didn't really understand what sex was, it was just childish curiosity for me and the \"sex phase\" eventually ended.\n\nBut when I was 11 my aunt got a boyfriend and she would make inappropriate remarks about her sexual encounters to my mother while I was present. Basically she was very happy with her partner's 'sexual prowess' and enjoyed discussing it out loud. But here's the thing, when she started doing it, I would become very embarrassed and upset. I would ask her to stop talking about it, to which she replied I was a brat for not allowing her to have a sex life and be happy. I felt guilty. She considered me as a friend and felt censored by me. After a few times I just tried to ignore her. This went on for two or three years.\n\nI remember she dragged me to some mall and forced me to meet her new boyfriend. I was so angry, I just stormed off and went back home. When she returned, she called me all sorts of ugly names, and my mother just shrugged it off, saying it was better not to force me to like the guy... This was the source of a lot of conflicts as I entered my teenage years.\n\nTalking about my mom. Living with my mother was hell as I was not allowed any kind of privacy. I was born with a medical condition; basically, the inner lips of my vagina were glued together, and when I was a little kid she had to do this 'massage' in order to stop them from becoming completely shut off. When I was 9 or 10, the issue was solved. However, my mom would still inspect my genitalia for a long time - I remember her doing it for the last time when I was 15. It was awful.\nAlso, when I went to take a shower, I was not allowed to lock the door, and she or my aunt would barge in multiple times during each shower to just chat or maybe pee or whatever. I was supposed to think this was normal, and I did, until I grew a little bit older and realized it was odd. I requested them to stop doing it and to allow me to lock the door. My mom freaked out. Everytime she found the bathroom door locked she would become extremely angry. As for my aunt... She mocked me. She said \"I'm not interested in that thing you have between your legs\".\n\nDuring my teenage years I also realized I was bisexual. They kinda suspected this was the case and would corner me and ask weird questions. My aunt would say how the whole \"scissoring\" thing put her off, and that when she was younger people would think she was a lesbian, but that she was far from it, etc etc etc. Basically used the whole thing to reaffirm herself sexually.\nThese are just two examples of my mom and aunt's weird behavior. There are lots of other things but I don't think they are quite as relevant to this story. Basically, my mom is super clingy and controlling, and my aunt is narcissistic and has this super weird necessity to keep telling everyone that she is, in fact, a sexual being. I also have misophonia and misokinesia and one of my triggers is seeing people with their hands resting on their legs - I become angry because I think they are masturbating in public. Very weird, right? My first trigger was my aunt, then my mom, then everyone. I have never seen my mom or my aunt masturbating but apparently something has made my brain project that image.\n\nI ended up moving out of the house at 20. They have moved out of the city and I have a hard time tolerating Mom's countless phone calls per day. As for my aunt, she doesn't say anything weird or sexual to me anymore. But she is a very hard person to deal with. I try to keep the talking to a minimum with her.\n\n\nBack to the dreams. In these dreams my mom or aunt would force me to perform sexual acts with them. The dreams are very vivid and disturbing. In some dreams I refuse and in others I comply. I wake up feeling very disturbed and fucked up. I hate this. I feel like I need to pour bleach over my brain.

We lived in different countries, but only a very very short plane ride away. It takes longer to get around my own country. \n\nIt was during the relationship i discovered he was a narc. There were so many lies, cheating, gaslighting, silent treatment. It was hell. Still I was trauma bonded and desperate for him. \n\nWe met up, just one time. For a few hours. After over a year together (and two discards). When he was in my country anyway. At 11pm when he was done with whatever he was doing for the day. Red flag, but I was so excited to see him. \n\nThe night went perfectly, so we did the same thing the next night. On no sleep, just met up, got a hotel, and that was it. He made out he was tired and just wanted to lie in bed with me. I wasn\u2019t complaining. Little did I know. \n\nExcept towards the end of the night, a few hours in, I suddenly got a bad feeling. The anxiety crept up, I realised the opportunity I had, and I simply asked him if I could look at his phone.\n\nI didn\u2019t want to go digging or deep, I just wanted to see. Given that he\u2019d lied to me about dating apps and contacting his exes in the past and I\u2019d stumbled across it. I just wanted to see. \n\nAnother red flag. I definitely shouldn\u2019t have felt the need to ask. \n\nHe refused. \n\nI begged. \n\nHe refused and said there was nothing to see. \n\nSo he stood up and got dressed. Over 2 years we spent a few hours together. And because I asked to see his phone, he just stood up and walked away. \n\nSo I panicked. I apologised for asking. I cried. I begged him to stay. I sat there in bed, naked, totally vulnerable, bawling my eyes out, saying I shouldn\u2019t have asked, and literally begging him not to leave. \n\nTo which he said he was already dresssd and he needed to go now. HE started getting upset asking why I couldn\u2019t believe him?\n\nSo despite all my begging, he left. I was absolutely broken. And anxious and stressed and worried. I even went back to his hotel, at 3am, and stood outside and asked him to come out. He said he was ready for bed and couldn\u2019t come out.\n\nWe never met up again. \n\nI beat myself up for so long, thinking \n\u201cIf I hadn\u2019t have asked, then I would have had a few more hours with him.\u201d\n\nIt was a few weeks later, after he discarded me just days after that meeting, that I found out I\u2019d gotten STDs from him. It took months to treat them. \n\nNow I can\u2019t get over what he must have been hiding. I see now that he would rather leave than even have me glance at his phone (which he was quite avidly on when I was doing something else). \n\nIt makes me feel awful. It makes me think things were so much worse than I could ever believe. I don\u2019t know how to cope with it. What was he hiding?\n\nPerhaps I shouldn\u2019t have asked.

When I got with him the child was about 6 he was going there etc I dint have a problem until I found out his was sleeping with her through a friend of his. \nFast forward it's been 4 years I have been with him I saw what that lady might have gone through whilst he was telling me his seeing his child he was actually hiding our relationship he was still in an intimate relationship with her he kept her hanging like he did me constantly arguing and disappearing like he did with me. \nHowever he was also talking to another woman on line for years and promised to marry her to! Again I saw this whilst with him. \nI told him see your child he said she wont let me she stopped answering his calls and that's bcz he demanded she stop speaking to her daughter screaming and shouting on the phone to I was just shocked as we were only 3 months married then I rember thinkng that will be me next. \nShe never took his calls after that now he says it's not his child and he hates him how discusting. \nHe never botherd but I was so in love with this man I didnt recognise this abuse for 2hat it was I had 2 pregnancies and lost them he demanded I have a child.\nLast past year I refused bcz of what he done to the first mrs he could do to me and he did say even if he had a child with me I didnt so listen he would leave me this was just few months back .

We have a 19 year old daughter who still lives at home. I kicked her narc father out three weeks ago. I had had enough! So many lies and manipulations! The mindfuck had me ready to kill myself. I had to break free! It\u2019s really hard and I\u2019m terrified but I know it\u2019s the right thing to do. \n\nA little background (you can check my previous posts for more on his behavior but this is more of how he threw our daughter under the bus and what I should tell her if anything). We all know narcs create insecurities and jealousy. This happened to me. I\u2019ve accused him of numerous affairs without undeniable evidence. I\u2019ve had concerns about encounters and have found circumstantial evidence but never a smoking gun. \n\nAlmost four years ago another woman came on the scene who he was working for and they spent many days alone just the two of them. I started noticing extreme shifts in his behavior. Personal grooming habits changed drastically! Everything became none of my business. He was glued to his phone! If I took a nap in the living room when I\u2019d wake up he\u2019d be locked in the bedroom. He said this was random accidental door locking! Yet it only happened if I had napped! Never after taking the dog for a walk or after a shower or after dinner just always when I took a nap. I found inappropriate texts from this woman (\u201cI want to hire you to come \u201cplay\u201d with me. RE: deck work\u201d and \u201ctoday\u2019s a perfect day to cuddle on the couch and watch old movies but let\u2019s fight the urge\u201d). He claimed I took them out of context. Yet suddenly he\u2019s into old Charlie Chaplin movies. He was never into them before or after this! I caught him in numerous lies about her. I found cookies on his phone for a website called Cougar Crush during this time and this woman is almost 30 years his senior! Plus she is known as the neighborhood whore. I don\u2019t think it takes a genius to recognize something was going on! \n\nSo I started watching and paying close attention. At one point I noticed a condom missing. It definitely went missing! I had been keeping a very close eye on them since I had thought two had gone missing previously. So I know for a fact we were missing at least one condom. Also, I came home one day and my house reeked of sex! He denies everything of course. I\u2019m crazy and jealous and insecure blah blah blah. \n\nSo here\u2019s my problem. At one point he said \u201cmaybe (our daughter) took the condom\u201d. Now she was 15 at the time so it\u2019s possible. I asked her and she denied it. She has admitted to stealing weed from us and taking sips of our alcoholic beverages when we weren\u2019t looking but has denied ever stealing condoms or money. She\u2019s a really good kid and I have no reason not to believe her especially since she admitted taking the other stuff. \n\nIt is clear to me her father tried to deflect blame to her to create doubt in me. I can\u2019t get over him being willing to throw our child under the bus to save himself! It enrages me! How dare he blame her for his scumbaggery? To throw shade on your own child is downright disgusting, abhorrent behavior! I want to tell her so she can protect herself from him but it will truly hurt her. She knows he\u2019s pretty useless (she\u2019s started calling him a man child at about 14 without any prompting from me) but he\u2019s her father and she loves him. Being as he is so irresponsible and can\u2019t be bothered he is more a friend to her than a parent. I was left to discipline and do most parenting duties and he played video games and watched YouTube with her. They have a really good relationship. \n\nI don\u2019t know what to do. If he is willing to throw her under the bus once he will not hesitate to do it gain. I want to warn her but I don\u2019t want to break her heart! Yet I think she needs to protect herself from him but I don\u2019t want to hurt their relationship and come across as vindictive and or bitter. I know if I just let it go she will eventually see him as clearly as I do. She\u2019s smart and observant and now that he no longer has me to hide behind and use to make himself look better it\u2019s only a matter of time before his true colors are on display for all to see. Most can see he\u2019s arrogant and lazy to begin with they just don\u2019t know how bad he really is. But longer she doesn\u2019t protect herself from him the more damage and abuse she will endure. \n\nSo what do I do? Warn our daughter her father threw her under the bus to save himself or just let nature takes its course and wait for him to clearly reveal himself to her? It took me 18 years to figure out what I was dealing with and almost four more years before I finally ended it. I don\u2019t want her to suffer decades more of his abuse making excuses for him like I did. But I don\u2019t want to be seen as vindictive or bitter or like I\u2019m trying to sabotage their relationship. Any advice is greatly appreciated. Thanks so much!", "subreddit": "NarcissisticAbuse"}

I don't think his behavior is in any way caused by my mother, as she did everything she possibly could have to help him. Reward systems, punishments, medication, anything the therapists said to try she did, but nothing seemed to really work. All his medications only made him more irritable and violent. He punches people, throws them against walls, kicks, throws hard and heavy objects, and destroys property. He even nearly killed one of our pet frogs by slamming his fist down on top of it's enclosure. He always calls my mom and I slurs, lots of swears, and insulting names. I've told my therapist about some of this, but I plan to tell her more this coming Monday. I really can't take much more of this, especially the harassment towards our animals that I would rather not go into detail of.

{"post_id": "bbacpw", "created_utc": 1554828999, "title": "AITA, Abuse Edition", "author": "JuliaPancake", "self_text": "CW: child abuse, sexual abuse, damn long story\nTLDR at bottom\n\nBackground: My mother\u2019s father was severely sexually abusive in her childhood (60s-era). As an adult, she decided not to outright live in denial, but to live like it didn\u2019t happen. In the 80s, my sister and I were allowed to know our grandparents and stay at their house, etc. This resulted, surprise surprise, in sexual abuse starting with oral rape when I was two or three, and going on for years. I\u2019m kind of afflicted now.\n\nNow, sex abuse doesn\u2019t happen in a vacuum. It requires an intricate web of lies, denial, control, and manipulation, and it must be woven and maintained by people other than just the perpetrator. There is even a pattern of recruitment and exclusion of people to do these jobs. For example, if you bring home a new SO, the family will be more likely to accept and feel comfortable around someone who seems more easily controlled than someone who seems principled and independent.\n\nSo my mother participated in this web, chose it over my safety, and has never really accepted responsibility for feeding me to this monster, nor for the years of manipulation at her hands to ensure I felt worthless. And she certainly hasn\u2019t grasped that I struggle with real issues because of it that interfere with my daily functioning, like PTSD, depression, anxiety, etc.\n\nThe thing is, I think she genuinely believes I am lazy, obstinate, and spoiled. She doesn\u2019t look at me and feel compassion for the child she harmed, she looks at me and feels disappointment and embarrassment. She feels frustration that I don\u2019t make her look better and vindicate her parenting methods. All of her behaviors belie these perceptions of me, and yet when questioned, she\u2019ll vehemently deny feeling this way. She doesn\u2019t even seem to know what she\u2019s feeling, but yet her feelings do control her behavior.\n\nSo she finds excuses for being angry and hateful. For example, she\u2019ll take out work stresses on others and then be convinced that she did no such thing; she was only screaming because she folded laundry in the den for an hour and no one came to help her because everyone thinks they get to live in her house and not help out. But last week she might have folded laundry happily for an hour and even turned away help.\n\nGrowing up, I believed her when she would rage. I would resolve not to do XYZ again or not to ignore ABC. But of course her demands were always vague enough to have not been done correctly, and trying not to ignore something when you don\u2019t know what it is doesn\u2019t really work, and just produces an unbearable tension and anxiety that interferes enough in your functioning to earn you more rage, just when you start to let your guard down. I felt like I was never good enough, but worse, she would never admit, when questioned, that she felt that way. \n\nI also know she saw in me a lot of warning signs that I was being abused, but refused to let them get through her Denial. I failed at school, spaced out all the time, teachers raised concerns constantly that something was bothering me. I chewed my nails, feared everything, forgot everything, suffered excruciating stomach pains. I was bullied and had trouble making friends, couldn\u2019t talk to strangers. I had no sense of personal space or bodily privacy. I wanted to die by the time I was ten. My symptoms of PTSD , anxiety, and depression were chalked up to being \u201cspoiled\u201d and \u201cdemanding attention\u201d. I simply cannot imagine ignoring such distress in my own child, let alone blaming them for it.\n\nShe is convinced that whatever emotional neglect or abuse I suffered was just an inconvenience, and that I exaggerate, and that because it\u2019s \u201cin the past\u201d and she \u201ccan\u2019t undo it now\u201d, that I\u2019m getting too hung up on it. Over the years I\u2019ve come to understand what I did and did not experience, and how wrong it was that a lot of these things happened to me. I don\u2019t think she would accept her actions as abuse. She still pulls strings to manipulate our family, creates chaos, undermines relationships, and she will not hear anything against it. She is convinced that her perceptions are driven by reality, and not by her inherited need to control, silence, and weave a protective web around child abuse.\n\nI still have trouble knowing whether I am right in labeling her as an \u201cabuser\u201d. With my grandfather, it is very clear cut. I vividly remember specific acts that incontrovertibly violate every rule in the book. But with her, it feels like I\u2019m imagining abuse where maybe she was just angry, or I was too sensitive. Plus it\u2019s easy to try and justify her behavior because of the awful childhood she had.\n\nAnd her abuse was different. She wouldn\u2019t explicitly say \u201cyou\u2019re lazy,\u201d or \u201cyou\u2019re selfish\u201d, but *everything* in her behavior said this was what she thought. She once caught me standing in thought while in the shower, though there was no explicit rule against this, she felt I was wasting time and water because of my inherent selfishness and self-absorption. She didn\u2019t say this exactly, but she raged at me for \u201cjust standing there\u201d and carried on about how unbelievable it was and made me feel like no one gets lost in thought in the shower until I felt like I was a complete freak who should have known better, and I felt ashamed thinking back on how many showers I\u2019d spent like that without even knowing I was being weird and selfish. But the kicker is that for literally *years* after this, nearly every time I went to take a shower, she called after me, \u201cand actually *take* the shower, don\u2019t just *stand there*.\u201d This was VERY typical. It was like at any moment I could be humiliated, and be made to feel like I deserved it. And I believed I did deserve it; I still feel like I\u2019m just irritating and abnormal and not tryig hard enough to hide my gross insides.\n\nSo she never explicitly said, \u201cYou are a bad person,\u201d but she did treat me like I would screw up if I wasn\u2019t kept in line, and I always felt unable to keep up with her expectations. I\u2019m almost 40 now, and I still feel fear about how she\u2019ll react to things, and this influences how much Truth I tell her. I definitely fear to challenge her. Plus, how is it not abuse to essentially feed and cover for someone you know is a pedophile?? \n\nI guess I would like to know if she is really an abuser because I kind of feel like she\u2019s currently trying to mess with my mind. One of the ways she controls is that when you get in trouble, she\u2019ll bail you out. But it always comes with strings attached, and in the end, you *will* be perceived as ungrateful. But she doesn\u2019t see it this way. \n\nRecently, I had to take my preschooler and leave my husband in a hurry. She let us live with her. This was on the surface a generous gesture, but it was made clear that we were an imposition. And almost immediately, she tried to \u201crecruit\u201d me to her side against my sister and her husband, who were not on speaking terms with her. Then she and her flying monkeys began to scrutinize my daily activities (\u201cBob said when he came over, you were still on the couch on your phone\u201d) and it became clear I was not becoming self-sufficient fast enough for her, and that she was painting me as lazy.\n\nEventually she took out her work stress by raging at me and my preschooler, frightening her and humiliating me, because she was being \u201ckept awake\u201d at 10:00pm by my small child, who I was (apparently) purposefully allowing to stay up late, despite knowing this bothered my mother (I did not), because I was \u201cjust being stubborn\u201d. I found this unacceptable, and told her so, but she insisted she \u201cjust raised her voice\u201d and anyone would have done it because of how aggravating me and my kid were being. \n\nOk, I can read the writing on the wall and I\u2019ve seen her do this to plenty of other people in my life: she likes the initial thrill of being a Rescuer, but then it gets boring or tiring, or they\u2019re proving unwilling to be her punching bag, and so she sets them up to do something \u201cwrong\u201d with herself as the victim so she can feel justified in withdrawing her help.\n\nWe spent the next few days staying elsewhere and securing new living arrangements. You\u2019d think she\u2019d be happy to have her house back, since it was so hard to live with us, right? Wrong. Nope, somehow this \u201cbroke her heart\u201d and my stepfather\u2019s, when they were nice enough to help us move and let us stay with them. And she must not be all that bad, she says, because we always come running to her when we need rescuing, etc. The night we moved, she and my stepfather chewed me out for an hour, telling me moving out was the wrong decision and I was being petty and childish and not thinking of my daughter. They then made a point of revoking everything they had gifted me or lent me a hand with over the past year that they had any kind of claim on. I was calm and didn\u2019t rise to this, but apparently that wasn\u2019t right either because I was \u201cnot being communicative\u201d. \n\nI just want to know if I\u2019m the asshole here. At the very least, I feel like a failure because I don\u2019t have a \u201creal job\u201d and I\u2019m in my 30s. So on some level I feel like she\u2019s justified in saying I\u2019m lazy and entitled because I\u2019m not on my feet like adults are expected to be. But on the other hand, I have a happy and healthy preschooler that I genuinely try to defend from abuse. And I mean, I have PTSD from being raped before kindergarten, *because of my own mother*. Not everybody gets over abuse like that enough to be 100% functional. She would say I\u2019m making excuses, though. It\u2019s hard to know what to think.\n\nTLDR: I have PTSD somethin fierce because my mother abused me (i think) and also knowingly didn\u2019t protect me. She says I am ungrateful for help she\u2019s given me recently and there\u2019s no reason I should suck at life this much, but I think she might actually be the asshole here.\n\nI guess I just feel like I would act a lot differently if I got my own kid raped before kindergarten.", "subreddit": "abuse"}

We were cuddling and got out of bed too late, she became stressed, hurried into the bathroom and spent half an hour getting ready. At 7:30 pm she was ready and I needed to go to the bathroom too, it didn't take me longer than 5 minutes though. \n\nAt that point, she started getting pissed at me and gave me the fault for running late and told me that I'm a little kid and can't stick to a schedule. I made the error of telling her that it's not just my fault.\n\nThen we needed to go to the supermarket to buy some stuff for the party. In the supermarket, I sent her best friend a text that we were going to be late. Shortly after, she told me that we should probably let her best friend know about us running late, and I said I already did so.\nAt that point she got super pissed at me and freaked out about how I'm not supposed to text HER friend, because it's HER friend and she told me on several occasions that I shouldn't text her behind her back. I had texted her friend on some occasions in the past because we understand each other well and she helped me a lot when my girlfriend once again refused to communicate.\nIt continued with her bringing up all sorts of mistakes I made from the past and started insulting me. Eventually, I got so helpless and frustrated that I shoved the shopping cart passive-aggressively into the other one when we left the store, which made her lose her shit. She told me that I act like a little kid and that it'd better for me to drive home after the party (meaning a 9h drive btw.) and that I should go and see a therapist.\n\nShe gave me the cold shoulder the entire evening, embarrassing me in front of all of her friends, acting like I'm a piece of trash.\n\nEventually, she allowed me to sleep at her place, but she was clearly uncomfortable and told me I should drive home the next day.\n\nI said I'd stay in town because I already had bought a ticket for a show of my favorite band that I wouldn't want to miss, but I promised her to respect keeping the distance, which was tough as hell, because I wanted that pouting of hers to end and overall the argument but was incapable of doing so.\n\n**[textbook example of narcissist manipulation starting here!]**\n\nLater that evening she texted me that she feels sorry for me and I could sleep at her place, and asked when the show would be over. I said it would be over at 10 pm. She said ok.\nAt 9:30 pm I texted her the main act hasn't even played yet so I'd be late. She told me she's going for a run anyway, so she could bring me the key. I said that's awesome.\n\nSuddenly, at 10:00 pm, I got a text that she's tired and about to go to bed and not going for a run anymore. I texted her that's fine and I'd pick up the key.\nAt that moment, my band was about to start their show, so I rushed to the car, drove to her place to pick up the keys, just to find her being super mad at me for \"trying to turn things to my advantage\" and \"not respecting her need for sleep\" and \"not respecting her conditions\". I was super confused because I didn't know what the hell came to her mind. So there we had another discussion and then she got mad at ME for us having a discussion, wasting her precious time. It ended with her telling me to sleep on the floor on an a small shitty mattress. I wasn't thrilled, and I told her so, so she threw me out of her apartment. I drove back to the concert but the band just finished their last song. \n\nSo there I was, money wasted, time wasted, feeling like an outcast. I called some friends and one allowed me to crash at his place. He also invited me to his party the next day, but told me my girlfriend was invited as well. I said that's fine, I don't mind, I'm far too old for pouting etc.\n\nAnyway, when my gf heard about me being at the party, she said she wouldn't come and instead made her entire class come and meet at a shitty bar instead of going to the awesome party.\n\nThe next morning, having slept for like 2h, I drove home for 9h, feeling like shit.\n\n**[END OF ARGUMENT PART]**\n\nI texted her later and asked her how to proceed. She told me she's going to need some time and her space for things to cool down before we can see each other again. \nI asked her if this is just a slow breakup, she said no, she's not going to break up with me, and that I shouldn't be so insecure and ask all the time (hidden insult again).\nI told her to be fair and not make me wait just to have her change her mind and break up with me. She said all she needs is some time for herself and she needs me to see that I can respect it.\n\nI felt like SHIT the entire week. I hated myself for the mistake with the shopping cart, I actually seeked a therapist just to realize I don't need aggression therapy but I'm being abused by a narcissist partner.\n\nBut I love her too much, so I always acknowledged how it's my fault and how I'd respect the distance and space she needs.\nI bought train tickets for the weekend, hoping she'd change her mind and allow me to see her, make peace, but she said she wants a weekend for herself and doesn't want the risk of it being ruined by us having an argument again, and that we would argue all the time (we had a total of 3 arguments within the past year). I told her I can understand, but that it's also normal to argue in a relationship. She told me I should do the aggression therapy first and then we could see each other again.\n\nNow another week has passed and I'm dying to see her. When I told her last week, she said I'm clingy, impatient and don't act like 26 and I should seek help. I said I'm not clingy, I love her and I finally want to see her and make peace. I even offered her that I'd take a hotel room so she doesn't feel compelled to have me sleep at her place. She said no and that I should finally respect her wishes and conditions. \nI didn't hear much from her that weekend, except for how awesome the weekend was and how good she felt.\n\nSo this weekend, I finally want to see her, because the next two weeks she's going to be studying for exams, and that's a time where we agreed on not seeing each other, because when she's studying she's super stressed and easily pissed.\n\nBut again, she told me she just has one day off this weekend and isn't ready to take the risk of having it ruined by us having an argument.\n\nAs a reaction, I deleted my WhatsApp and didn't respond for a whole day, just to have her CALL ME in the evening (she hasn't called for like 3 months) just to tell me that she loves me but I should please respect her need for space even if it's tough.\n\nI don't know what to do now. I seriously can't stand another 2-3 weeks without getting the chance of seeing her. We haven't seen each other for such a long time before and I'm really on the verge.\n\nI once made a surprise visit after an argument even if she told me she doesn't want to see me and it worked out very WELL, it fixed everyhting for quire a long time!\n\nBut this time I'm not sure if it's a smart idea.\n\nI just want her to know that I'm not some annoying business appointment that you try to schedule and postpone as late as possible but her fucking BOYFRIEND, a human being with feelings and desires...\n\nWhat do you guys think?", "subreddit": "NarcissisticAbuse"}

When I was a toddler my dad left. My mom told me that he \"wasnt feeling it\" and he didnt want to be a dad. My dad still had full custody of me and my schizophrenic autism brother. My mom eventionally got remarried to someone who ended up sexually, emotionally and physically abusing me for about 10 years of my life. I thought this man was my real father. I thought that until in 2009 he killed himself. Shortly after my mom told he my dad was alive and the man who had done these things to me was my step dad. \n\nShe was ashamed and had no idea the things that were happening to me personally because he was already abusing her and my brother. She didn't think the abuse went that deep. For the record I don't blame her. She had stolkholm and took years to be able to handle everything that took place. \n\nThe abuse started not long after they got married. He would do drugs, get drunk and party in the garage all day and night. He has thrown my brother threw a wall for taking too long to pee. He has beat my mother down with a frying pan until her head left an indent in the floor and he spent many morning refusing to let me leave his bed and I would scream and beg to be allowed to go to school. I remember my brother being forced out into the snow one night because he couldn't blow his nose. He almost died. I remember the blood and pain from having a beer bottle smashed over my head for not being able to count to a thousand. It was a living hell. I remember my days as grey. I didnt think there was happiness inside me. I never bonded with anyone. As far as I knew we lived a normal life.\n\nHe killed himself over the phone with my mom and us. My mom should of shielded the conversation better but she was terrified he was going to hurt us and wasnt in her right mind. He would go from a nice loving voice to a demonic sounding one saying he would hang us all from our peach tree. In the end he destroyed our house and hung himself in their room.

I\u2019m cycling through all the emotions like a roller coaster. I know I\u2019m doing the right thing but as you all know, it\u2019s really hard! \n\nI think the worst is the loneliness. Even though we all know our narcs aren\u2019t the best companions they were still a presence, well at least for those of us who lived together. Of course it wasn\u2019t always bad, they can act human very well sometimes. So I guess that\u2019s what I miss. Just having someone there. \n\nYet, the more I think of it the more I realize just how lonely I was with him around. Yeah he was here physically but even when he was pretending to care he didn\u2019t really and so there was never a deep connection. I was never fully felt like I had a partner and was loved and cared for. How could I when I always had to be on guard for the next hidden dig, or disrespecting of my boundaries, or never being able to really talk to him?! How could I when I knew any time he made me feel bad just mentioning it would cause an argument of which I\u2019d be blamed for \u201cthrowing a wrench into things when they\u2019re going good\u201d! You all know exactly what I\u2019m saying! That constant need to suppress everything about yourself just to keep the peace! Then being called a robot for it!! The never being able to feel cared for and loved! Always having to make excuses for his disrespect so I could keep lying to myself that he loved me and thought I was worth it! Even though everything he said and did proved he didn\u2019t care at all. I was just where his bread was buttered, of which he actually told me.  \n\nSo I guess my point is that when I\u2019m honest with myself, being with him was so very, very lonely!   It\u2019s actually less lonely now because of this sub. I don\u2019t have his physical self here but that\u2019s okay because the connections I\u2019m making on here are based in reality, mutual respect and understanding, compassion, and actual real well wishes.  It doesn\u2019t matter that you\u2019re all strangers and we will never meet, there is still a more real connection with you than with him. I have amazing friends and family irl so I can have a physical presence of someone if needed.  I\u2019m girl-next-door-cute so if I need intimacy I\u2019m pretty sure I can find a willing partner. It wouldn\u2019t be much different than with my Nex. I never felt cared for so intimacy with him was just another thing I had to do to keep the peace. I mean I was comfortable with my next because of familiarity, so a random hookup would probably be awkward. \n\nThe point is, again, there isn\u2019t much difference between being lonely with my Nex and being lonely without my Nex. The only difference is that I\u2019m no longer begging him for effort and consideration and love. It\u2019s actually better now.  Still lonely but so much less desperate for any scrap of anything I could convince myself was love. I don\u2019t feel pathetic anymore. Desperate and begging to be loved! I will never again beg for what should be freely given. \n\nSo I\u2019ll be lonely and I\u2019ll be okay with that because I have self respect again!", "subreddit": "NarcissisticAbuse"}

She takes responsibility for the feelings of others and she entirely ignores her own wellbeing. She's all over the place. No long-term plans. Just lots of open joy and hidden pain. On the outside she is the happiest person you would have ever seen. \n\nAs our relationship developed, I tried to let her go easily, that did not work. She tried leaving her boyfriend but every time he plays on her weakness, meaning starts crying and says that his life is terrible and it would be the worst thing ever if she left, his father is sick, blablabla. Even though they barely see each other or communicate. He ignores what she says entirely and just talks about how devastated he is. She then feels like a terrible person. You get the idea.  \n\nI asked her a million times what she'd like me to do. I have told her that I will do anything she wants. No questions asked. I have never blamed her for anything. However she behaved, I never judged her. There are days when if I manage to convince her to spend time with herself, she gets better. She then usually initiates contact with me, we spend some time and she starts feeling great. However that is usually followed by a crash, particularly if she meets her best friend or gets in contact with her boyfriend. \n\nHer best friend is a devoted catholic which in this particular situation has devastating effects because catholics are not widely known for support or understanding. They are widely known for justifications of pain though. Terrible combination in this scenario. \n\nI don't know what to do. Not to mention that absolutely nobody but me knows about her condition. I can't leave because I am working on getting her to see a psychotherapist. I found a few because I also started seeing one. She preferred men. I found the best one there is. However it takes time. With each passing day I myself I'm bordering madness. I am becoming unstable. I am barely hanging in. \n\nI spend around 2 hours a day telling her that she is amazing, pointing out situations where she takes it upon herself to be understanding but is also understanding when others mistreat her. How she constantly blames herself for everything and allows everybody else to entirely ignore her needs, emotions etc etc etc. \n\nThere is progress. She has stopped supporting a friend which she never liked and which was painful for her but \"she had to do it what if he feels bad.\" She told another friend that has been courting her that she doesn't ow him anything. She stood up for herself and even made fun of him. But these are the people that she cares very little about. \n\nAnother aspect is that with her love for me came memories and dreams. And with those came memories of how everything crashes and how much pain it brings. \n\nShe has been having nightmares for like 2 years. She met me, she said she had first nice dreams. Unfortunately now nightmares seem to have intensified more than ever. \n\nThere's probably more that I could tell but hopefully somebody can related and give some advice. My goal is to get her professional help. While I have her trust which is difficult to earn. The rest of people close to her are clueless not to mention she is not the one that shares. She only shared with me because I noticed and identified and described things, feelings she feels, made accurate guesses about her past experiences and she started feeling like I already know everything about her. \n\nBut I am falling apart myself. I can't handle it anymore. Yesterday after witnessing her panick attack... I stayed with her. I told her everything will be fine. I walked with her and tell her Greek myths because she wanted me close but didn't want to talk. \n\nI leave her small presents almost every day. I write her letters. I constantly fight her self-doubt and self-bashing. I tell her she is a good person (this triggers her). I tell her she has never done anything wrong to me. I tell her her voice is beautiful. This is pretty much my every single day. She can behave however she wants. I shower her with sugar and slip in a moral or two of how she should consider her own interests based on what is happening and what she tells me. \n\nHowever, as I said, I don't know how long I can last myself. I can't leave because she will never open up to anybody else. I can't really move forward because nor can you heal people with love, nor is she ready to have a relationship, any kind of relationship. Not to mention she starts feeling guilty in front of me because I have treated her too well and she feels like she does not deserve me. \n\nAny advice? What can I do? How do I survive this? Can I run? I am running out of patience. And not the kind of patience where I choose to not be patient. The kind of patience where I have to cry to pull through the day, where It's getting difficult to not say how I feel, that kinda patience. I am afraid of consequences. And I am afraid of consequences to her. In general I have never been more scared in my life.", "subreddit": "survivorsofabuse"}

I was abused as a kid and I had never been in a serious relationship before. Looking back so much could have been avoided if I stood up for myself. I was worried about being a jealous shitty boyfriend and I really blamed myself for our problems. Looking back she was crossing obvious boundaries and I just stood there and took it. The memories make me feel bad about myself to remember. It makes me feel so weak. Our relationship feels traumatic to me.  \n\nIt was such a confusing disorienting situation. I was really gaslit bad and going to therapy to work on my \u201ctrust issues\u201d while she relentlessly cheated on me with one of my friends. She told me she thought my trust issues stemmed from my dad leaving. God I regret opening up to her and being vulnerable now. Later I found her writing she never loved anyone like him before and she never had a crush so intense. So much writing about him, months of writing about him. I never self harmed before but I did after reading that stuff and it can still make me cry to remember how low I was that day. Our relationship was so emotionally intense, it was so painful and disorienting to read that stuff. It was one of the most painful things I\u2019ve ever been through. I\u2019ve never felt that devalued before. It made me feel so violated that she touched me and we slept in the same bed while she wrote that stuff. I was driving two hours to see her and paying for parking while she cheated with one of my friends. And she was okay with having me do that. It enrages me to think about it still. I don\u2019t understand the selfishness and lack of empathy. \n\nI\u2019ve never had anyone speak to me like her before. She might think because she\u2019s a girl or because it was partially over text that it\u2019s not abuse. But it is. When she called me a \u201ccomplete and utter fucking worthless piece of shit\u201d I had flashbacks to the way abusive guys would scream at my mom. She\u2019s no better than those guys. The last text she sent me before blocking me was \u201cyou\u2019ve made me feel so guilty about this. Fingers crossed I don\u2019t end up killing my self!\u201d. I texted her sister for about a week occasionally asking if she heard from her because I was afraid she would hurt herself and it would be my fault. Then someone sent me a post she made about how her psycho ex wouldn\u2019t leave her sister alone and I quit in disgust figuring she was actually fine. She should have included the part about making me think she was going to harm herself! I don\u2019t understand the cruelty. \n\nI had been cheated on before, but we were very young. Even then the girl cried and apologized and I could tell it was a mistake. We were still on good terms. It hurt but not like this. This hurt isn\u2019t normal. I always said I could understand cheating as a mistake. But this was too planned out, too manipulative, over too long a period of time and too non-apologetic and I am disgusted that someone could put that much effort into being a lying cheater. \n\nThinking back to her obviously flirting with him in front of my face, and me telling her I was uncomfortable later only to be told I was too jealous triggers me. I was literally watching her flirt with and form the relationship with the person she would end up cheating on me with. And I blamed myself for being uncomfortable with it at the time. \n\nWe had fights near the end where I would say over time our relationship felt like a completely one way relationship that only benefited her and she wasn\u2019t willing to ever accept responsibility for the things she did wrong. I was talking about things like not cleaning or saying mean things when she was in a bad mood. I didn\u2019t know it would extend to her cheating on me. I\u2019ve never seen anyone blame the victim so much before. As if she didn\u2019t tear my heart out of my chest and behave in a godawful hurtful way. It wasn\u2019t enough she had to tell me I was a piece of shit too and threaten to kill herself to scare me. Because she was mad that I logged in to her twitter to find proof she had been cheating on me for months. After all those times of telling me I was too jealous over this guy and I needed to back off, I find out she has been seeing him behind my back for months and she pivots to \u201cyou invaded my privacy\u201d. So what, did you want me to leave the relationship thinking I was a jealous boyfriend and it was my fault? I deserved to know the truth and you wouldn\u2019t give it to me.", "subreddit": "NarcissisticAbuse"}

I'm so hurt today that my personality has changed to a point where I don't even know what - how - to feel.

It feels like I'm a chemical that needs its activation energy to be met before I can release my emotions, and man does that take a lot.\ufeff\n\nI told a teacher about what happened and she cried, telling me that (after my mom sent a text to me saying that she never wanted to see me, was ashamed of me, etc. etc.) my mother was incredibly cruel and it hurt her to see someone like me - who she called a shining star - abused. She sent me to the counselor and she said it was nothing. The counselor then (likely for legal reasons) sent me to an officer and he said it was normal behavior from a mother.\n\nFeels great to have 8 years of targeted abuse swept under the rug by adults who don't give a damn.

He was actually a pretty good drummer and mostly played drums for the first few years of our relationship.

It is a bit strange for me because it was always my ex's friend and I never got the opportunity to get to know him,  I was never part of their friendship,  or included.  I saw him at parties and in passing,  and we would be friendly but that is it,  nothing more.  \n\nThe thing is my ex treated me terribly,  he was very emotionally abusive,  but nobody knew that,  he always put me down,  was very controlling and made me feel I was lucky to have him because of how \"boring\" I was.  I am a bit worried about what my ex might have said about me to him,  (my ex hates me and blocked me on everything) also I think he knows some things that I don't know because there are pictures of them on a night out with the girl I never met that my ex left me for months before we broke up?  I guess I am curious what he knows about all that,  since I never really understood what happened,  but at the same time I don't know if I should just not bring the ex up,  cause I don't want to seem hung up on him or make things awkward.  The thing is my ex was extremely two faced,  he would say mean things about this \"friend\" To me behind his back like laugh about how he thinks his friend flirted with his mother,  he said to me as well a few times \"ew could you imagine having sex with him,  his sweaty body all over you? \" I remember just saying I never thought about having sex with him no,  he would laugh about how his friend was trying to copy his style and how stupid he looks,  I remember whenever him my ex and I were together rarely I never knew how to act because I knew my ex laughed about him and mocked him behind his back but in person acted really genuine. I felt like screaming wake up he is using you for someone to play guitar with, he thinks you are a joke,  but obviously never said that,  so I sat there awkwardly being polite letting my ex do all his usual nice,  cool act that people fell for.  I guess because I have no ties or loyalty to my ex anymore I feel like telling him what a horrible person he really is,  but I know that would just make me look bitter and hateful,  or trying to create drama,  and of course he would deny it anyway.  \n\n He is in a different country with the person he ran off with. He was abusive towards me mentally and verbally sometimes physically. I carried so much shame for a long time. The thing is I am a very honest person,  and I have never seen or spoken to anyone my ex knows since we broke up,  nobody else ever reached out to me and it does feel I am being fake in a way,  meeting to \"catch up\" When the reality is the past 2 years have been a tough struggle to get where I am,  I was in a dark deep depression for a year and then for a year slowly started accepting things,  and facing the reality of the situation,  it hasn't been sunshine and roses.  I work hard to keep my mental health in order,  and it's not easy. I do want to meet him because I don't want to feel like my ex controls me or my decisions,  but at the same time,  I don't want to be fake and pretend like it has all been fine,  but I wouldn't want to go into my struggle anyway unless I felt I could trust him with out telling my ex things. For all I know they haven't spoken in years,  how do I handle this the best way?

I don\u2019t ask her for anything ever- she expects me to do absolutely everything. She refuses to cook or clean or run any kind of errants. She constantly calls me a bitch or a nag for asking for help (I am so, so exhausted). She makes excuses about why she can\u2019t come support me at any work or family events but is always available to go out with her friends. \n\nThere was an emergency in my family recently that has impacted me emotionally in a very severe way. She told me that she didn\u2019t have the mental space to support me and that I was sabotaging her performance at school... I am constantly obsessing over her attention and her affection, which is dwindling by the day. The more disinterested and cruel she acts, the harder it is for me to have respect for myself and to disengage. I am confused about whether this is really bad behaviour or if I am actually bad to be around? I FEEL bad to be around. I feel clingy and desperate. \n\nAs of this week, She just landed an amazing job and now makes significantly more than me. She\u2019s announced she\u2019s moving out in 2 weeks for the duration of the summer to work on her mental health. She\u2019s already found an apartment and has More or less financially screwed me over, as her small contribution was the only thing scraping us by in this apartment. I am devastated and completely blindsided. She doesn\u2019t want to break up?? She\u2019s jokingly said it\u2019s like a sabbatical  from our relationship. I am utterly convinced my life would be destroyed if she left me bc she has alienated me from most of my friends. I\u2019m weirdly self aware that this is residual from being manipulated and constantly threatened but I can\u2019t act on it.", "subreddit": "NarcissisticAbuse"}

The advocate suggested talking to the police, that they would have a good idea of what to do. And you know what? I got past all of the self doubt and fears, and I did it!!! I skipped class so that he would not know I was headed to the campus PD, and went and talked to an officer. I told him everything--and he had us move to the headquarters off campus, talk to the detective and the chief, talk to campus advocates, everything. They actually went and did the breaking up for me, found him in class and told him that I was breaking up with him and to never contact me again. They already set up a new apartment for me that lets me keep my cat, and I am in it tonight, so he doesn't know where I'm at. Poor kitty is scared of the new place though, he is hiding under the bed :(\n\nI have counseling set up for me tomorrow to help me deal with this, they have been helping me work out all the details, I never imagined everyone would be so supportive! I was so touched at how understanding and kind everyone was! I cried way too much, but they just helped me through it. My classmates helped me move the stuff I needed to, and were so supportive!\n\nI am still working through the emotions of it all--sometimes it feels so amazing and joyful and free!!! and then sometimes the voice comes back saying, \"maybe you are as bad as he said you are, and it is all your fault, and you gave up on the best person there would ever be for you. He must feel so betrayed right now. Just imagine how he is describing you to his parents! Maybe he was right, and you were the abuser--after all, don't some abusers taunt their victims until they lash out, and then call that abuse? Maybe you were doing that subconsciously, and it was his fault you got angry! What if he kills himself tonight? How could you break up with him like that, so brutal!\" One of the things the officers said that helped with that was: Did the cat deserve to get hit by your boyfriend? No. I didn't deserve the way I was treated either. But I still have a ways to go between knowing, and believing with every fiber of my being.\n\nI just want to thank everyone on this sub that has encouraged me this entire time! I know the breakup seems long overdue (it was), but all of the encouragement and help that you guys has given me has helped steel me for today. I can't thank you guys enough! I honestly believe I could not have gotten this far this fast without you guys! And I am now living proof that yes, you can get away from your abuser! Even if you need to go to the police to do it, it can be done! All hope is not lost! I am so relieved! Thank you guys again so much!!!", "subreddit": "emotionalabuse"}

{"post_id": "bbgzlb", "created_utc": 1554864743, "title": "Was my ex a narcissist?", "author": "sadgirlteas", "self_text": "I just broke up with an abusive ex and started to wonder if he was a narcissist. **Side note: I don\u2019t need you to tell me \u201cWho cares. Move on and get over it.\u201d It just happened on Friday and I haven\u2019t even been able to see my therapist yet so if making this post will help soothe some of the thoughts going on in my head then so be it.** I ruled out sociopathy because he keeps the same people around for far too long and apparently that\u2019s not a thing sociopaths do. I\u2019m leaning more toward covert narcissism. Here are some of the things he does:\n\n- **He lies, lies, lies.** I don\u2019t even know where to begin. He told me and a bunch of other people that he graduated undergrad at Berkeley and was getting his Master\u2019s in Biopsychology at Stanford. *He didn\u2019t even finish community college.* He told me he was fluent in Spanish, a language I\u2019M fluent in. A lie. He told me that the rapper KYLE was his cousin, which I believed at first because they look alike and are from the same place, but then he had the audacity to claim that he helped him produce songs on his latest album.... He would always act like he knew more about everything than other people and very rarely admitted to not knowing something. If I brought something up during a text conversation he would claim to be an expert on it but it would be very obvious that he just googled it and is spouting some Wikipedia nonsense word for word. Whenever I corrected him on something he would get so fucking upset like I called him an idiot or something.\n\n- **He gaslights.** When I questioned his lies with proof he would admit to them, but if I didn\u2019t have proof he would call me crazy, paranoid and insecure. He did this constantly. He would complain that I don\u2019t trust him and I don\u2019t know what I\u2019m talking about.\n\n- **He was intensely insecure.** We were both still in contact with our exes. I didn\u2019t care because I trusted him, but he would always bring up my ex like \u201chow\u2019s your boyfriend/girlfriend\u201d as if I was cheating on him or something. He even said this about my BEST FRIEND! He would get jealous of my BEST FRIEND! He would also mention in passing how he feels he isn\u2019t worthy of love or that he\u2019s not that attractive.\n\n- **He was addicted to attention and affection.** He cheated on me with multiple girls, but what confused me is *how* many girls it was. It just seemed like he was constantly fishing for praise and affection from new people. He would even sit on Reddit and constantly message random people who had posted rfr. If I could explain him I\u2019d say he\u2019s *too* friendly. He is just constantly seeking more, more, more. He also can actually be really supportive at times (he got me into therapy), but I think it is just to feed his ego. I think he gets a boner out of knowing that he\u2019s the reason for someone\u2019s happiness or success.\n\n- **He would belittle others.** He would just mention how certain decisions I made were stupid or that I was insecure or bad with money. He just always acted like he was better, smarter and more mature than me and had more life experience therefore he knew what was best. He also belittles others intensely behind their backs. The most shit he talks is behind people\u2019s backs. Calling them immature, ugly, crazy, unstable, and judging every aspect of their life.\n\n- **He manipulated people and used them to get what he wanted.** He manipulates girls into trusting him so he can use them. He would manipulate me into giving him money. Another girl told me she\u2019s known him for 6 years and he had been leading her on the entire time (most likely for money because she had sent him gifts and money for things). He would say he wanted to marry her and told her she was the love of his life, yet he told her he was asexual (a lie because he\u2019s almost hypersexual). I mention this because he would constantly tell me that the girl is ugly. It just sounded to me like he led her on knowing he wasn\u2019t attracted to her at all or had no intention to be with her (using asexual as an excuse so she wouldn\u2019t ask for sex).\n\n- **He lacked empathy.** This was the one that tripped me up because he is also autistic, or at least he was diagnosed autistic. People with autism tend to have trouble empathizing with others and so I always attributed that trait of his to autism and nothing else. He always thought about things logically or from his point of view. If I was upset about something but it made no sense to him, he would be intensely dismissive and most likely not apologize or only apologize after some time or if I stood my ground.\n\n- **He made everything about him.** Every story he told made him out to be the victim or the \u201cgood guy.\u201d Every time he fucked up he would turn it around so I\u2019d be the one apologizing. If he failed to go through on a promise \u2014 *I\u2019ve had such a bad day and I\u2019m exhausted. You\u2019re so insensitive*. This goes into lying too because he would make up lies and stories to get out of fucking up. One time he was supposed to fly somewhere and made this elaborate story about how his brother ran off with his car, ID and luggage. He even cried. I am 99% certain that story was a crock of shit.", "subreddit": "NarcissisticAbuse"}

{"post_id": "bbhyct", "created_utc": 1554871472, "title": "sister accused brother of sexual abuse, no evidence", "author": "flashgrenade", "self_text": "Hi, today I got a text message from my sister-in-law. She dropped a bombshell on me. Basically, she said that when she was in 3rd grade and her brother (my husband) was in 6th grade, he came into her room several times and tried to get her to touch him. She said she always said no and that for a few years later he would walk around the house masturbating and exposing himself to her. She said she decided to tell me since she didn't want anything to happen to her niece. My daughter is 3 years old.\nSo I immediately show this to my husband and he's like WTF. I ask him if this is true, if he did anything to his sister or our daughter. He vehemently denied it, said his sister is crazy and that he would never hurt his daughter.\nSo I called the sister-in-law and talked to her. After listening to her, I told her I would have to talk to her and my husband's parents. She said that she told them about this happening when she was a kid and that their parents made a rule that they weren't allowed together at night but that was it. Then she tells me when she brought it up as an adult, her parents said they didn't believe her. She believes that they blocked out the memory. She also stated that she has lost several boyfriends due to her trauma and that she is awkward when it comes to sex.\nSo I talk to mom-in-law. She told me that when her daughter first went to college, she was having a lot of trouble fitting in and living away from home for the 1st time. She was in a sorority with a lot of partyers and that wasn't her scene. She went to see a counselor and did Regression Memory Therapy. This was when mom-in-law first heard the story of childhood abuse. (In the freshmen year of college.) She swears that is not something she and her husband would have done nothing about and forgotten. Mom-in-law also says she doesn't believe it because every time the sister mentions the abuse, the story changes and becomes more elaborate. The parent-in-law's said they considered suing the counselor but decided against it as it would be expensive, hard to prove, and thought it would hurt their daughter more. Mom-in-law stated that she believed time would heal her. \nSo this could destroy my husband and I's marriage. I've known him for 11 years and he has never forced himself on me. I've never seen any indication of him being weird with our daughter either. When he gives our daughter baths, he will become embarrassed and ask for me to take over if our daughter gets curious and looks at her private parts. \nI asked the sister why didn't she mention this before I got married to her brother. She said because it was difficult for her and she views her brother as a life long fuckup so she thought we would get divorced. I've been married to her brother for 6 years now. We were even planning on having our 2nd child next year. Now, who the hell knows. I don't know what to think or believe. I feel the same as when a flash grenade went off in my face. (Former military.) This is the 1st time my husband has heard of this. He always thought she became bitchy toward him after she entered college because she joined a sorority. Now he realized her attitude toward him changed after the counseling.\nSo if the accusations are true, I will leave my husband to protect my daughter. If false... I mean, what the hell. Do you think the counselor implanted false memories? In my opinion there's no evidence, but I told my husband that I would solely do bath time with our daughter from now on. I truly don't think he has done anything to our daughter, but just in case. shrugs\n\nThis is miserable. My husband tried to hug me since I was crying and I unconsciously moved away from him. He said he feels tired and is uncomfortable and worried that anything he does with our daughter will look suspicious now. And yeah, now I'm going to be hyper vigilant. :( Did an overzealous counselor ruin a family's life?", "subreddit": "survivorsofabuse"}

We have only been together for 5 months. He is absolutely a narcissist \n\nI've known him for a couple of years, and would do free art for his band, was working unpaid on a comic he has been writing for a long time and really thought he was a cool guy. I met him when I saw his band play. I tagged him in a pic and he started following me back and messaging me. I was 21 at the time \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nPeople really like him and he comes off as VERY kind and generous. He was always nice to me, really nice to my family over social media when he had no reason to be, would put me and my friends on the list when we went to see his band play, stuff like that. \n\nI was engaged to somebody else until this last September. In August, I told my N about all of the problems in the relationship. Before, when I would get lunch with him or hang out with him, he hardly paid attention to me and would look at his phone while I was talking. The only time he would actively engage with me was when he was telling me a story about somebody had wronged him in some way and he didn't understand why since he was always so nice to them. \n\nWhen I told him about my issues in my relationship, however, he became VERY attentive and supportive, told me that my ex and friends didn't care about me and that he would show me how real friends act. We started hanging out a lot and he pushed me to break up with my ex. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe went from him only texting me when he wanted something (free art) to texting me every morning, asking me how I was, asking me to hang out or work on projects together. \n\nHe would let me hang out at his workspace and tell me nobody has ever seen that part of his process before.   \nHe would be super sweet to me, brush my hair out  of my face and then immediately jump into a story about a crazy ex girlfriend and how they wronged him\n\nHe convinced me that my friends didn't care about me at all and I started to distance myself from them \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHe was super attentive, sweet, constantly giving me gifts, we would stay overnight at cool places, he told me he had never felt like this before, that I was his soul mate.. I felt really special, especially after coming out of my other relationship where I felt very neglected\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFrom the very beginning of things being romantic he was constantly involving other girls in some way, but at the start it was in a way to make me feel important, like that he had chosen me over somebody else. The other girls were all called crazy, but of course they were still his friends and would talk to them constantly. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe relationship has been mostly a secret, except from a handful of people. This was for a lot of reasons I think, but his reasoning was always blaming me. He said it was because my ex would be upset, that if my friends found out they would all hate me and not talk to me anymore and things like that. He also said once that he didn't want one of his friends (who is a girl that has feelings for him) to find out because he is trying to use her to get a record deal with the place she works and that if she found out he had a girlfriend, it would ruin everything. He later denied saying that. \n\nHe also is constantly messaging other women and \"fans\" and I think he knows that it would decrease if they knew he had a girlfriend. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOver time, his nice comments became almost insulting comments about how I look or what I wear or how I view the world. He stopped giving me gifts or wanting to do anything with me at all. He would get VERY angry if I texted him asking what he was up to, telling me that I was extremely needy and needed constant validation. He got mad because I asked him why he didn't say \"I love you\" back one time, and after literally giving me 5 different excuses in 10 seconds, turned it on me for even asking or being bothered by it. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHe would get mad at me for asking who the girls were that he was talking to, turning on me and telling me that I was jealous and it was a huge turn off for him since all of his crazy ex girlfriends were like that \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIn the last two months, we have had sex once (it was horrible). I've felt completely alone and REALLY depressed and suicidal.\n\nI suffer from pretty bad PTSD from another relationship with a narcissist where I ended up being raped by him. \n\nMy N uses this against me constantly, blaming my PTSD on any issue in the relationship. He literally said once \"So we can both agree that all of the issues we are having are because of your PTSD?\"\n\nA lot of the ways I've been feeling since dating my N, I haven't felt since I was with my abusive ex. \n\nThat's kind of what made me realize something was really wrong. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy (most recent) ex, who is actually a decent person in general, regardless of the reasons why we broke up, ended up finding out that I was in this secret relationship. At first he was mad and hurt, but then he was just concerned. I have reconnected with my friends recently, especially since they know now, and they brought up how they thought he had groomed me.   \nI researched it, and now I agree with them. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSince everybody knows, I brought up to him about being more public, which he just made more excuses for, yelling at me about how EVERYBODY in his life already knows about me and that I was the one who was ashamed because I hadn't told my roommate (who I hardly speak to at all)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAfter I realized he was a narcissist and researched it a bunch, I realized that I'm really getting manipulated, gas lighted and used. I don't want to be with him anymore, so I decided I wanted to break up. \n\nBut I CAN'T.

(cleaning out mother's vagina as a child)", "author": "WaitingHorse", "self_text": "First post I've ever made so sorry if it's a bit messy (might be a bit graphic, sorry).\n\nBackground: I'm looking for a job and live between my two parents (who are divorced). My mother struggles with a drug habit and her mental health (including being sexually abused as a child). She's never gotten proper help for her problems.\n\nWhen I was a kid, from the ages of about 7-11/12, my mother would ask me to help her clean her vagina out.\n\nThis involved using cotton buds to clean her genitals out from white flecks of toilet paper and sometimes discharge. She'd use a mirror to look at herself down there and use her other hand to move around, looking around her vagina. Sometimes I'd trim her pubic hair.\n\nI specifically remember moving the cotton buds on/around her clitoris a lot (because it was kinda easy for the specks to get stuck there) which can be arousing for women. I don't know if I'm seeing this worse than what it is because I can only get off to clit simulation in masturbation so I assume it must have felt good for her (I don't have sex because I'm repulsed at the idea of ever sharing a bed with someone because of these memories).\n\nI never was touched by her. I never physically touched her (except with the cotton buds/trimmers). But I do remember her having some kind of discharge which, the more I think about, the more I wonder if it was her being aroused by what was happening. I wondered at the time why she kept on looking at her vagina, moving her fingers about, telling me to make sure she was clean, especially at deeper parts of her vagina.\n\nI didn't know anything about women's bodies at the time. I'm pretty sure there were times I moved the cotton bud over her vaginal entrance, never in it, but definitely about it. I didn't even know that vaginas could be penetrated at the time.\n\nI feel repulsed every time I think about it. I blocked out most of the memories, never discussing it with anyone ever since, but it just doesn't feel right. I hadn't even thought about it for years until my mother told me about her own sexual abuse as a child and now I have mixed feelings. Did she just need help cleaning herself? She didn't have any disabilities at the time that prevented her doing it herself (I feel like she would have told me if there was anything because she overshares to get sympathy). Am I overthinking this?\n\nI've never heard of people doing things like this for their parents. The last few months I've started remembering it, the more disgusted I am with her. I already have deep anger for her because she was the reason my parents split and her drug habits are destroying the remains of my family.\n\nThe worst part is that she still has the mirror she used years ago. I've developed such a strong sense of hatred for it. I also feel disgusted whenever I look at her fingers because it reminds me of her moving her fingers about her vagina and clitoris.\n\nI'm scared this is going to affect any future sexual relationships I might have with a potential partner, and my relationships with my mother and the rest of my family. I already hated her before because of her drug habits and could barely sleep in the same house in peace, but now I feel like everything I used to think of her before the drugs was a lie - she wasn't a wonderful mother turned abusive because of drugs, she's just naturally like that.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTL;DR: My mother got me to clean her vagina when I was a young child and I'm not sure if it was for arousal or not. Part of me wants to seek further help, but I'm not sure if it's even worthy of that.\n\nWas it abuse or am I overthinking?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEDIT: Thank you for all your comments. I thought it wasn't 'bad enough' to be abuse, but I realise now that that mindset is so wrong. I'm going to look into different therapy groups and talk to my doctor about this, but I don't think I have the courage to confront my mother on why she did it (she's very emotionally unstable and always talks about how good of a mother she was because she hasn't done much else with her life).

Advice please?!!", "author": "m_eye_nd", "self_text": "Things ended for the final time with Nex around 10 months ago (wow that\u2019s gone quickly!) and we were together for nearly 3 years. \n\nIt happened during my years at University and he lived with me at my shared uni houses with my friends. There was me, Nex, my friend and her boyfriend and another friend. \n\nMy friends boyfriend was always really friendly with us. Obviously they eventually saw what took place between me and Nex. They heard the screaming and shouting and saw the bruises. And eventually he turned on them too and nex and my friends boyfriend were close to having physical fights several times. \n\nI noticed that whenever nex would start on me and storm out the house he (friends bf) would come check on me and make sure I\u2019m alright. I thought nothing of it. He would also get really annoyed at me for not ending things with nex because of what he was doing to me. I just put this down to not understanding my situation; people don\u2019t get how hard it is to do that, to leave. \n\nNex always said that my friends bf had a thing for me, I was convinced he didn\u2019t. Now I think he does. I graduated uni in November 2018 and I haven\u2019t seen my friend or her bf since. But he started to message me and then he started to get inappropriate. I told him I moved house and have an en suite his response was somewhere along the lines of I can imagine a few things we could do in there. This made me super uncomfortable he\u2019s my friends bf, why would he put me in this position. \n\nI told him that our friendship is purely platonic. He laughed it off, but agreed to tone it down. Then he still continues sending me flattering messages. I slowly fizzle the conversation out over a few days and do not initiate any conversations with him again. 3 weeks later he messages me saying something like he thinks I don\u2019t like him because I don\u2019t message him. I said it\u2019s because I\u2019m busy, I don\u2019t message (insert friend/his gf\u2019s name) much either. I kept asking about how she was and trying to bring attention to her to highlight that this still isn\u2019t appropriate. \n\nI know I should have told my friend straight away, but I couldn\u2019t. I don\u2019t know why, I just felt like what if she doesn\u2019t believe me, what if he twists things, what if she doesn\u2019t want to be my friend anymore. I just don\u2019t have the energy to deal with anymore drama or loss right now. And I\u2019m still pretty terrified of any confrontation. The stress gives me heart pains and makes my stomach turn. \n\nSo I\u2019ve not spoken to him for a good few months. But I put a picture up of myself online (on snapchat - FYI it\u2019s where you can send pictures / videos / chat directly to friends or you can put up videos / pictures of whatever on your \u2018story\u2019 where all your friends can view it) and he took a screenshot of the picture on my story. It notifies you when people do that. But he didn\u2019t say why or tell me he had done that. I assumed he probably wanted me to reach out and ask about it so that he could then start a conversation. But I didn\u2019t. This was yesterday, now today he is liking OLD social media posts of mine. I feel like he\u2019s stalking me. He also liked a very old social media post a few weeks back to which I ignored. \n\nI don\u2019t want him to have saved pictures of me. I don\u2019t feel comfortable with him looking through things I\u2019ve posted in the past - because it means he\u2019s sat there thinking about me. And he\u2019s not even saying anything about the fact he\u2019s doing these things. Which I find odd. Clearly I\u2019m not reacting to him with these things so you would think that he would get the message and then stop. \n\nIt\u2019s weirding me out and making me really uncomfortable and I hate to admit that nex was right. But I feel like he\u2019s a vulture. I don\u2019t think he\u2019s a nice person at all. Because we met and he saw me at my lowest points when I was with nex. He saw me when I was an absolute mess I\u2019d hit rock bottom, I was erratic and unstable - and that\u2019s being nice about it. No one would want to date or have a fling with someone like that - I wouldn\u2019t - so I don\u2019t see this as a crush (which is WRONG to his gf who is MY friend). I see this as him thinking I\u2019m some emotionally insecure person who would be good to manipulate as he\u2019s seen it done before (by nex). \n\nI\u2019m not sure how to go about this. If I tell my friend I really feel I will lose her. I know he will manipulate this situation I can just feel it in my gut. If I block him I\u2019m scared he\u2019ll then worry that means I\u2019m going to tell my friend and then he\u2019ll manipulate the situation to her. Or, that he\u2019ll find another way to contact me and get nasty. I can just sense that this guy has a fragile ego and (clearly) doesn\u2019t take rejection easily. I\u2019ve seen him BLOW up at nex before (although nex just stood there calmly and smugly) and I cant have someone do that to me again. I feel like I\u2019m stuck in a bit of a catch 22. \n\nI know I\u2019m also probably massively blowing this all out of proportion. I know it\u2019s because I\u2019m still quite effected from nex and the abuse so my judgement is hazy. Please could I get some outside opinions and advice? \n\nI feel like I\u2019m being a coward, selfish and disloyal to my friend by not telling her, although I\u2019m scared of the repercussions if I do.", "subreddit": "NarcissisticAbuse"}

Narcissist is a pretty harsh word and if the person hasn\u2019t been properly diagnosed it can be defamatory. \n\nHowever, I (28F) can only tell my truth of the story and go from there. I\u2019m three months out of a toxic relationship and I still cry almost every day from all the mind games and feeling like I don\u2019t recognize who I became or who I am now.

In a way he did because I never told one soul, other than eventually my parents, what he did for the entire first year of our relationship, which was cheat on me: after each time confronting him, he claimed never physically only online. And yes there were multiple times I caught him online, and as I said I\u2019m working on why I allowed to be treated that way. One of the first times, my friend saw his profile on POF and sent it to me, I defended him. I went through all that alone, because we also had mutual friends and I didn\u2019t want to tarnish his name, but god was that ever lonely.

He would say some pretty disgusting things about how my family was dysfunctional and lazy, which is so far from who they are. They are the most selfless people I know and I would not have had any strength if it weren\u2019t for them teaching me how to persevere through the tough times. This is ultimately what led to our break up, that he couldn\u2019t come between us and isolate me from my family; well that, and then deciding once again to cheat after a year and a half working through the infidelity issues and building the trust again. \n\nHowever, this post isn\u2019t about the cheating and those lies, it\u2019s about all the other behaviour I tolerated that slowly broke me. It\u2019s about the times where when I had hard times at work and he would in the moment be very supportive, only to use those same hardships during an argument to put me down and use it against me. It\u2019s about the time I threw him a surprise 40th birthday party and he acted like he was appreciative around his family and friends and then later when we were alone tell me he hates surprises, picks a fight, and hardly speaks to me for the next week. It\u2019s about those times where I would be told \u201cno, [my name here]\u201d after every time I had an idea or an opinion. It\u2019s about those times when trying to express how I felt about something he would always say I was trying to ruin the moment; it\u2019s for those times that I was always reminded I didn\u2019t have a voice.  It\u2019s for the times he always told me this is why people don\u2019t like you; It\u2019s for that time I made a life decision to follow him to his home town and then to have him cheat on me less than 24 hours after I came back to the city to wrap up the final few weeks of my old job, it\u2019s about him lying to my face about it, and it\u2019s about how through this break up he\u2019s acted like the victim and is still trying to attempt control over me and \u201cmy phone usage\u201d. It\u2019s that even though I was the one who decided enough was enough that I was still discarded so easily and that hurts; it\u2019s for that I now commute four hours a day to get to work; or for that the first 6 weeks I slept on friend\u2019s couches; it\u2019s for the therapy sessions I now attend once a week just to make sense of the entire relationship, break up, and who I am now. It\u2019s for that he\u2019s already with someone new living in our dream home that I still pay half the mortgage until it sells. \n\nThis is my truth, this is my pain, and this is my vulnerability. This is for anyone who is going through something similar, we will get through it. We will come out stronger, wiser, and much much happier. And him/her? Let\u2019s wish them luck, because in the end all we can do is feel sad for them, because they are clearly holding a lot of pain in. No one who is happy and loves themselves treats others like that, especially loved ones. It\u2019s their truth and whether they ever let those closest to them see it or not, is not our issue. It\u2019s completely and entirely on them. What\u2019s on us is to move forward the best we can each day, each moment, we are strong and capable. We must now look inward and determine what made us tolerate and vulnerable to let someone take so much of us. We are in the process of healing and we will never let anyone treat us this ways gain, and that my friend, is the beauty in this fucked up situation.", "subreddit": "NarcissisticAbuse"}

I'm on mobile so the formatting or whatever might be messed up, so sorry in advance, also sorry for any spelling/grammatical errors.\n\n!! This is also going to contain the topic of pedophilia and some nsfw mentions as well as a brief animal abuse mention, so watch out if that's not something you want to read about !! \n\n\nSo as the title states, I'm not even sure if this counts as anything more than just being a creep/a disgusting person or if this is something deeper than that, I honestly can't tell if this has made a deep lasting impact on me, though it scared me off of friendships and going into any kind of relationship even more than I already had been.\nSo I met this guy online when I was about 14 years old, he was. 16? maybe 17, I can't remember. I was a cringey kid but right off the bat we got along really well, and after being friends for a few months we started dating. I had always had bad thoughts related to violence due to prior parental abuse, and he was the only one that made me feel like I wasn't a complete freak for having them, in fact he indulged and encouraged them and told be to do bad things to myself. He was obsessed with shota/loli content (basically borderline anime cp) and would constantly call me a \"shota\" and bring up my age, then tell me how much he hated teens and how they were so annoying but how I was so mature for my age, as well as constantly doing sexual things with me. We broke up and dated once more after that, but I felt it didn't work out so we simply stayed best friends from that point. When he was 18-19 and I was 16, he confessed to me that he was a pedophile, around that time he started growing extremely toxic too. I wasn't surprised at his pedophilia confession and I should've cut him off then and there, but he was the only friend I had so I tried to ignore the toxicity and tell him it was okay, especially since he'd told me he had told his therapist and would never act on it. He then would constantly tell me how I was \"vanilla\" and so \"inexperienced\" because I wasn't into the stuff he was, aka because I didn't want to f*ck toddlers. I have old screenshots of messages where I was honestly believing it and calling myself boring for basically not being into kids, and I feel so horrible for not actually stepping up and doing something. \nMy current girlfriend broke off our relationship and I hadn't been in contact with him for 2 years when I recently found out he'd been taken in by police, reported by some of his friends since he'd made disturbing jokes about having sexually abused his dog and one of his very young cousins, and also confessing to being in possession of real cp. He'd never confessed to anything like that when we were still talking to each other, but I still feel horrible for not stepping up and doing something sooner. I hope he rots in jail for being a genuinely disgusting human being.\nI know I kind of drifted off but my initial question is still if this counts as grooming or abuse at all, since we were both minors when we first started dating and there's only a 2-3 year age gap. I'm really sorry if this seems like a stupid question, the last thing I want to do is to ridicule actual victims or make them look bad, I just feel like some other opinions would really help me out and possibly give me some clarity.\nThank you very much in advance!", "subreddit": "abuse"}

Connections, even perceived ones, are so rare for me that I am unsure of how to deal with them, the correct protocol to follow. During the very first date, your constant complaints about your ex and how she was to blame for everything that had happened between you was overwhelming, and I admit that I floundered. You were completely new to me, and dating a virtual stranger was something I had never done before. So I believed you. Why wouldn\u2019t I?\n\nThe relationship moved fast in the beginning. I was actually happy, although now I struggle to recall why. Having only experienced one serious relationship previously, I let you sweep me along, and ignored the warning signs. The subtle talk about other women to \u2018keep me on my toes.\u2019 The moodiness, and the negativity. After a short while, you had discarded all of your friends and expected me to do the same. \n\nThe mind games began almost straight away. Silent treatment as punishment for doing something you didn\u2019t like, but which you would refuse to explain to me in a mature way. Arguments that stemmed from your complete lack of communication or empathy. Gaslighting me at every turn, and insisting I was crazy. This was all so new to me; a relationship with a man 9 years my senior, who had a young daughter. I accepted that you were the grown-up, that you were more experienced with relationships. Maybe this was normal. Or maybe I didn\u2019t deserve any better. \n\nYour refusal to be seen out in public with me supplemented this. You didn\u2019t want to go out, but you didn\u2019t want me to go out either. A night out with my family would result in the silent treatment for a week, until eventually I snapped and attempted to talk it through. Then you would call me crazy and gaslight me. On the rare occasions we went out shopping, you would start an argument with any man you noticed looking at me, but deny that it was anything to do with me. They \u2018looked at you the wrong way\u2019, or some other ridiculous reason. I tried to believe that you were jealous, but you scoffed at that idea. Why would you be jealous of any man looking at me?! My self-esteem was destroyed. I began to believe you, believe that this emotional abuse was the norm.\n\nI got a new job which involved early morning starts. I was exhausted, yet you would scream at me if I dared to fall asleep early on the couch. You refused to go anywhere near the supermarket I worked in, despite the staff discount. You scoffed at my job as team leader, even though I loved it. You continually attempted to convince me that it was a dead end job, and that I wasn\u2019t important. But I felt that I was, in a way. My manager made me feel that I was, and my team. But you ignored that, and continued to snipe. You never failed to pick me up when I finished, which I was grateful for, yet you acted like it was a hardship. I suggested I get public transport home instead, but you were adamant you would continue, even though it was done in bad grace, which made me feel worse.\n\nWhen I was having trouble with a colleague and I came home to talk to you about it, you told me to shut up complaining, and that if I continued, we were over. \n\nI wish I had walked away. \n\nI remember my best friend coming to stay. I still had my own flat at the time, but was spending the majority of my nights at yours. You didn\u2019t want to meet her. You insisted that I was to stay away, and you would not be in touch for the weekend. I was puzzled, but acquiesced, even as I struggled to understand. My friend was outraged, but I made excuses for you. I didn\u2019t know any better. I didn\u2019t feel I knew you well enough to make a scene. I allowed it to happen. \n\nOn our Saturday night out, we came across you, out with your friends in a club. I didn\u2019t know you would be out, but you insisted that I was following you, trying to keep tabs on you. When your friend started talking to me, you lost your temper. My friend and I left the club and got a taxi to yours, where I proceeded to pack up my things. It was over. \n\nIn the aftermath, it felt like a huge weight had been lifted off my shoulders. No more tiptoeing around on eggshells, afraid to say anything you didn\u2019t agree with. I was exhausted and just wanted a break from you. You wore me out with your constant negativity, and the way you acted like you hated me. But you quickly came back round, apologising and begging me for another chance. You sent flowers to my workplace, which I knew was a big deal for you, as you hated anything to do with my life away from you. \n\nStupidly, I gave you a second chance, even though part of me didn\u2019t want to. You promised to change. But you lied, and it was back to normal within a week. Your horrible negativity, your moods and silent treatment, the way you refused to take accountability for anything and blamed it all on me, the feeling that you actually hated me rather than loved me. \n\nI fell pregnant by accident and decided to have the baby. When I told you, I explained that, because we hadn\u2019t been getting on, you could leave and I would do it alone. You refused. However, when I eventually held my son in my arms, I knew that I no longer felt any love for you. It was over, in my eyes. You had no control over me anymore. \n\nYou hated that more than anything. But I managed to break free, and it was the best thing I ever did. \n\nI can\u2019t regret you, because you gave me my son. But I wish I had recognised the abuse for exactly what it was at the time, and dealt with it differently. When I think of all the things I missed out on because of you.. but I love my son, and wouldn\u2019t change a thing.\n\nThese days, I can spot a red flag from a mile off. So you taught me something.

I didn\u2019t have anything bad, but I had some guys blocked (Id had my same snapchat since high school). When he seen this, he grabbed me by the hair and slapped me hard twice telling me to delete it. He pulled me off the couch and gave me his laptop since you have to delete it online. After I deleted it, I ran out of the house and drove away drunk. A block away, he called me saying he didn\u2019t want me to drive drunk and that he would sleep on the couch. After I went back, he kept bringing up the blocked contacts. I told him that he hit me, and I didn\u2019t feel comfortable and I went to the room and cried.

I would be lying if I didn\u2019t say there were red flags before that I ignored. He changed the way I dress, act, everything. I don\u2019t have hobbies, all my friends and family are distant because I never see them anymore (he doesn\u2019t want me to) or because they cant stand to see me like this. He tells me I have to wear eyeliner and mascara when we go hiking (even though I never would wear make up to work out/hike) when I questioned that, he said I looked lazy.

We work in an office with two other people, both of whom are about my age (early twenties), while the supervisor is in his late fourties. Most of the time he's nice enough, but all of my coworkers (even those not working in our office) are a bit afraid of him because he throws the worst temper tantrums when something doesn't go his way. \n\nHe likes to see himself as a fatherly figure to us, and talks about hobbies a lot, especially \"nerdy stuff\", like computer games or programming, but for some reason I'm the designated person he picked to be \"too nerdy\", so me being into d&amp;d and manga and having programmed my own game before makes me into a weirdo in his eyes, and he constantly makes fun of it. I mostly laughed it off for the past year but by now it's really getting to me. But since I know that we need to walk on eggshells around him I usually shrug it off or tell him not to overstep, but he doesn't care cause he \"means no harm so it's not bad to say it\". \n\nWell, now I've actually had a fight with him over some trivial issue, which escalated because he wouldn't let me quit the conversation when I said I didn't feel like he understood my point, or when I told him I felt like we were talking in circles, pressing me to go on, shouting at me so much that I couldn't even get a word in, and when I disengaged he made nasty comments about it until I asked him to stop, which he took as an opportunity to hurl unfair accusations and insults at me until I burst out in tears, shouted that I was sorry and left the room. He's been giving me the silent treatment ever since, trying to provoke me by blasting loud music in the office and all in all being pretty obnoxious, but I stayed strong and tried to give him space, only once asking if he could turn the music down a bit because I needed to concentrate for a particular task. He glared at me and acted as if he turned the volume down but actually didn't, so I simply left the room. \n\nToday he confronted me about the entire thing, and about how ridiculous he thought I acted by just walking away and not talking to him about it at all, to which I said since he was my superior (a fact on which he adamantly insisted during our fight because in his eyes that meant I had no right to object to his views), I wanted to give him space and make sure it was okay to talk to him again once things simmered down a bit. I apologized for how I had acted, because I raised my voice and that was not okay, but also told him that I was uncomfortable with the way things had escalated. \n\nHe didn't apologize but told me it was all my fault, and accused me of saying things I didn't say, which he didn't accept at all, and instead claiming he never said any of the things that I told him I was hurt by. He then proceeded to tell me the way I disengaged was not okay because he didn't want me to have the last word, and that I should have apologized to him sooner. And when I asked him how we could avoid such scenarios in the future he told me to disengage... when I pointed out that that was what I was trying to do he told me that I should not disengage when he felt like it was my fault. When I pointed out that that was what started the fight in the first place he declared the \"talk\" was over and forced me into a hug. \n\nFor the sake of peace I acted as if everything was resolved now, but really, nothing is. He tried to force his view of things on me, tried to gaslight me and used his position as superior to make me go along. Before this fight I doubted if he really was a narcissist and maybe he was just a little difficult, but he really was unable to see things from my point of view, and even told me that he liked to get into fights, which horrifies me so much. I'm unable to somprehend how someone could enjoy that.\n\nI can't quit my job right now, so I don't know how to deal with him. I grew up with narc parents and the fight with him has triggered some severe ptsd, my hands literally shake whenever he talks to me, and i get adrenaline rushes and everything in my body goes into fight or flight mode. I told a colleague about the fight and while she totally agrees with me that he acted unfairly, she doesn't see him as toxic or dangerous because she never had to deal with a narcissist before. She thinks he's just umpleasant sometimes. So do my other colleagues. But I don't know what to do anymore. I need to sit in a small room with him for nine hours a day and I just can't stand it anymore. \n\nI tried gray rocking before but he doesn't seem affected by it at all. When I don't talk to him he simply inserts himself into conversations I'm having with other colleagues, and makes dismissive comments about what I'm saying until the colleague in question talks to him instead of me. How do I deal with this? I'm looking for a new job at the moment but I can't leave my company until we've finished some projects, which will take some months to complete.

I have been browsing this subreddit for a month or so.  In some ways I feel as though I don't entirely belong here, as my recent experience has not be directly with an SO but with a spiritual leader. Painful?  Sure! However, as I read the comments and stories in this subreddit I am humbled that I feel that I have by God's grace avoided much of what happens when lives become intertwined with someone who suffers from NPD.  I am still struggling a bit ( I found myself attracted to this person even though I am happily married, desiring his attention and approval and basically caught in an emotional web due to some trauma bonding type issues, but it was mostly from a distance.) \n\nBut yesterday I stumbled upon a post on Quora that I found fascinating.  I can't say I agree with everything in it (as I lean very conservative in my faith) but it caused me to think deeply on the concept of telling and living the truth vs. living a lie.  One of the most challenging things I found in my recent struggle was the sudden realization that I may have been used as a scapegoat by a pastor.  Then my mind went crazy with the \"what if's\"  How deep down the rabbit hole could I go?  I have now gone 100% no contact in a sudden and even rather miraculous way.  (Had no plans on leaving the church, as we had relationships there, but I was offered a position of worship leader at another church and this was the same week the elders called me into the church office to reprimand me for speaking out about some things.)\n\nBut I digress...\n\nThe article on Quora was called \"What Spiritual Conclusions have you reached in your healing of narcissistic abuse?\"  \n\nSome points that really jumped out at me in the article are:\n\n&gt;That everyone and everything that is infused with the spark of the Divine (basically all who have not sold out their empathy) have a right to live and love and breath and create on this planet. It belongs to them. It is their birthright. It has been stolen from them and it is currently in the process of being redeemed.\n\n&gt;That there is a higher power that is able to affect all things on earth but it is only enforced in the context of Truth. In other words, when a person lives in line with their Truth (including shining a light on that which is not Truth), the Universe aligns to support them.\n\nI would say that \"the universe\" is just the hand of God specifically, and answer to the prayers of those who are pure in heart.  \n\n&gt;That empathy is the currency of God. That all people who have a capacity for empathy carry a spark of the Divine. The greater the empathy, the bigger the spark.\n\nInteresting way to put it.  As God is love, the comment of empathy being the currency of the Divine is a really profound way to think.  As an \"empath\" in some ways, I would like to agree.  However, I find myself often struggling with wanting vindication.  How empathetic am I?  Will I allow God to vindicate?  More thoughts...\n\n&gt;That even good and empathic people conspire with the lie when they allow it to have unchecked power. The difference between an empathic person conspiring with the lie and a narcissist conspiring with the lie is that, to an empathic person, it feels terrible, and to a narcissist, it feels good.\n\nThis comment is really good!  I know in my recent meeting I had at my church they were insisting that my husband and I were being \"divisive\" and self-seeking just by asking questions about some problems we had noticed (these were some serious issues too, with a 35 page write up on a whistleblowing web site calling out the leader of the entire organization for various problems) But we ended up being the \"problem\" for daring to ask questions about it and discuss it.  But we cannot conspire with the lie!  If we conspire with the lie, we become liars too!  We basically got kicked out of the church (well, technically they just tried to strong arm us into not speaking at all, but that is conspiring with them to hide the truth.)\n\n&gt;That the Truth is, always has been, and always will be, more powerful than the lie.\n\nAmen!\n\nAnd one more-\n\n&gt;That the Divine spirit dwells in people who make themselves appropriate vessels for it. Qualities like love, kindness, compassion, empathy, etc. make an appropriate vessel for the Divine. In contrast, qualities that are commonly found in narcissists (power, greed, envy, etc.) make a person very accessible to the lie.\n\nMy final thought, after reading this post, was that Jesus even said that he was \"the way, the TRUTH, and the life.\"  I never really thought about how Jesus IS truth!  I think because it is such a lofty kind of thought I never really took the time to realize then that he is the antithesis of lies.  Of course, Satan is called \"the father of lies\" so there is that too!\n\nHopefully I am not breaking any of the posting \"rules of conduct\" here (I had posted the link but then read we are not supposed to do that).  But I just thought this was a really fascinating thing.\n\nHope you are all having a great day, BTW.  You are all loved and that is the truth!  :)", "subreddit": "NarcissisticAbuse"}

I need to get this off my chest and get feedback. I\u2019m gay and in the midst of a divorce from my nex. Discard in May, NC minus a few incidents over text. \n\nIn December I finally stopped sulking for a hot second and started talking to this girl online and we started texting as friends and sexting. It was my first time really talking to anyone that way since my nex. She told me a couple weeks in that she\u2019s poly and in an open relationship with her partner of 7 years - they\u2019re a couple but don\u2019t have sex so she sleeps with other people and goes on dates, etc and basically has no limits on what she\u2019s allowed to do. I wasn\u2019t interested in a long-distance relationship (did that with my nex) anyway so I said that\u2019s fine and we continued talking. I met my nex online before we met in person so it was nothing new to me. In the span of about a month, from the way we talked to each other over text, on the phone, over FaceTime, it was basically like we were in a relationship except that we weren\u2019t. My friends knew about her and how often we talked and said the same thing. Saying all the right things and told me after a few weeks in that she had a \u201chuge ass crush\u201d on me and that she\u2019d never gotten feelings for someone she never met and I quickly got feelings for her too even though I knew I shouldn\u2019t, I couldn\u2019t help it. She\u2019d call me at night, once right as she was getting ready for a date and tell me how she\u2019d be thinking of me all night. She\u2019d listen to me talk about my day in a way that my nex never did that made it seem like she really cared. We sexted or FaceTimed pretty much every single day with that dom/sub dynamic (you can guess which one she is). It was such a confidence booster - my nex had no sex drive at all, so to have someone who\u2019s never even met me be so sexually attracted to me was a type of attention I\u2019d never had. I didn\u2019t mind being a \u201cside piece\u201d - it felt empowering to see her reaction to my texts and our conversations and how much she wanted me, that I had that effect on her. After feeling so unwanted by my nex it was such a high and I didn\u2019t care that it was unconventional. \n\nEventually at times while we were just chatting as friends apparently I could never say anything right and started saying things that pissed her off and she would lash out at me for no reason. Silent treatment and all and the make-ups after. We had a couple fights like this and then our final one on Friday. She gave me the silent treatment for 2 days and on Sunday night texted me to talk about and said \u201cthird strike, I\u2019m done,\u201d that was it. It was so easy. We went from talking every single day for 4 months to her cutting me off. It honestly feels like withdrawals. I feel similar to how I did with my nex when she ended things so quickly. The jump from love-bombing one second to discard the very next is like a shock to the system. I know whatever our friendship was is over but I miss her. 4 months doesn\u2019t sound like long but I realized how much narcs can do to you in such a short amount of time. It\u2019s a lot to adjust to when the high is gone, when they\u2019re gone. \n\nI never really understood what everyone here said about boundaries before because I just don\u2019t get it and the concept of what boundaries mean is so foreign to me, my only real relationship was with my nex and we had no boundaries and everything happened so fast. The same thing happened with this new narc. Since we became close friends she knew about my nex and listened to me vent, like when I had to break NC to text my nex about the divorce (she wasn\u2019t returning my attorney\u2019s calls, yes I know breaking NC is a no-no and I dreaded every second of it) and I was terrified because I was afraid of her lashing out. She knew all the dark shit about what I\u2019m going through with my nex because I\u2019m a fool and I told her and she used it to her advantage. All the pet names and texting all day, every day, how she made cute playlists for me, the way she talked to me, it happened so fast and she made it so easy to open up to her and now that it\u2019s over I recognize it. It\u2019s so much like my nex. Both the \u201clove\u201d-bombing and the discard. It\u2019s hard to say she\u2019s a narc (even though the signs are there) because I still see that sweet person she was at first and at this point I feel like it\u2019s my fault and it doesn\u2019t matter whether she is because I fell for it anyway. \n\nOne of the hardest things about going through this a second time is not only the reinforcement that I\u2019m disposable and that I can\u2019t trust anyone, but that this time it\u2019s my fault. I\u2019ve been hurt before, worse than I could imagine, and I\u2019m still healing from it. And yet I went and met another narc and fell for the games again. And this time I did it without even having an actual relationship. When so many of the red flags that should\u2019ve stopped me were right there. I knew there was only one way for this to end - with me getting hurt. And I did it anyway. Because I wanted the distraction from my nex, and I got it. It was so easy to get sucked in and ignore the red flags because the attention and the \u201clove\u201d-bombing felt so good. The last six months of my relationship with my nex was pure hell and there was no love-bombing at all, it\u2019s like I\u2019d been starved of that high and got my fix. I wanna be mad at this person for hurting me but I\u2019m mostly mad at myself, I feel like it\u2019s my fault that I keep getting hurt because I allow it. I guess I\u2019m used to being told by my nex that everything is my fault so my mind automatically jumps to that conclusion, even when she\u2019s gone. It feels like a pattern and I hate that it happened to me again and I feel like I let it. And I feel even sillier because she was in a relationship and I never meant anything anyway, it was all a game and I ate it up and got feelings when I knew nothing would come of it. \n\nI don\u2019t even know where I\u2019m going with this but I\u2019m so frustrated with myself. It\u2019s like a drug. The attention and the affection, the way they make you feel so important. And just like my nex, when I didn\u2019t fit the idealized vision that she had of me anymore, suddenly I was the devil and she cut me off just like that. Her words: \u201cthis was supposed to be easy.\u201d The high was so good and I miss it. Both with my nex and with her. I know it\u2019s the trauma-bond. I didn\u2019t realize just how much it had stuck with me and how much I crave it until this happened and I realized I fell into the same pattern. Someone tell me this wasn\u2019t my fault. I feel like it was. \n\nI guess what I\u2019m wondering is for anyone who\u2019s broken that trauma bond and been able to beat it, how did you do it and what made you want to change it? I know therapy is the obvious answer and I\u2019m going back to my old therapist tomorrow. I just don\u2019t know how to change it. I\u2019m 25 - I came out when I was 21 and had no dating experience before then so my only relationship experience is with my nex and I\u2019m so used to the highs and lows. I\u2019m scared that when I find the right person - someone healthy and stable - that I\u2019ll get bored because I\u2019m so used to the rollercoaster. That \u201cnormal\u201d will be boring to me. It\u2019s not that I enjoy the abuse, obviously. It\u2019s hell. I\u2019m just so used to the intensity of it that I\u2019m scared I won\u2019t recognize a good person who wants to treat me right when they come my way because I won\u2019t feel anything in comparison to the over-the-top, fake love-bombing shit I\u2019m used to.

Do you remember the next time you seen me, 2 weeks later, that you only said that as a punishment? \n\nDo You know I can't go to [redacted] anymore because I'm absolutely terrified of running into you or your family? Do you know that if I see any bald man in the street I can't look at him or I'll have a full on panic attack on the off chance it's you, so everytime I see a bald man I have to cross the street. \n\nEvery. Single. Night. My brain is just full of all the horrible things you said and done to me and I can't stop them. I have to live with these vivid flashbacks of everything you dome every single day and they hurt, they really really hurt. \n\nY'know how papa died when I was 2? Well do you remember telling me he had left me money? I know you mist because my mum remembers. Do you remember when I asked about him leaving anything to anyone when I was 10 you lied straight to my face and told me he had left me nothing? You constantly told me my dead grandfather would be very disappointed in me but I'm starting to think that was you projecting. \n\nI now get to scared to tell someone if I've hurt myself. Since the day I asked you if you knew how I got any of the scars in my arms, since I've had them forever and dk how I got them, you accused me of doing them myself for attention and then decided a suitable punishment was to walk 4 miles in 30\u00b0c heat without a drink or a rest.\n\nI've always wondered how things would be if you didn't hate my mum, if you didn't view me as my mum by proxy. Would your relationship be better? Would our relationship be better?\nFrom the age of 3 I remember telling you to grow up and communicate with my mum bc you were both raising me, but you refused. You never acknowledged the consequences of refusing to talk to my mum, the most notable one being when I was four and fell and you forced me not to tell her, if I had told her maybe the issues bc of the fall could have been sorted earlier, maybe I wouldnt have had to get 8 teeth taken out.\n\nThere was a lot of things you forced me to not tell my mum and I don't think to this day I understand why. We had a lot of secrets, a lot of which were you messing up but being to stubborn to acknowledge it so I couldn't tell anyone. \n\nSometimes I forget I don't have to do things that make me very uncomfortable to get something i want. Sometimes I do things I really don't want to get something small in return, because for as long as I can remember if I wanted something the only way i could get something i wanted was to kiss you, you know that made me uncomfortable that's why you bribed me.\n\nY'know the park directly across from your old flat in [redacted]? Do you remember the summer when we would go there a lot and and eat ice cream from the ice cream van? Do you remember that same summer you taught me how to swing on the swings by myself? I do. Its one of my happiest memories.\nI go there whenever I'm feeling sad, it's such a calming place. I love being able to watch all the planes land and being able to see the city centre, especially at night and all the beautiful hills. Its all been done up recently but sometimes I close my eyes and im back to being that 6 year old again with a dad.\n\n\n\nI know I blame so many of the things that \nhappened to me on you, and I know some of it is unfair but I can't help but feel like my mental health would be a lot better if you hadn't have done what you done.", "subreddit": "abuse"}

(Also first Reddit post, blah blah)\n\nAnyways, it's been about 7-6 years since this started.\nMy mom was nice to me up until age 7, then she had a complete personality change when I was in 2nd grade. She would start grounding me for no reason or over stupid things like not eating a hotdog (which btw, it tasted like shit and I haven't been able to eat one the same since)\n\nI was having problems with my neighbors (Might post about it on entitled people) and this just made it worse. These weren't just small groundings either, I'd get spanked and then could grounded from 2 weeks to 3 months (no shit, happened when I was 10)\n\nThings started getting worse around 4th and 5th grade for me, as I stated before I was grounded from late August to November. My parents punishments kept getting worse and my mom would always waste an hour lecturing me about how shitty a child I am, how I just wanted people to pity me, etc. (Not only that but I was dealing with bullies so I hated myself more than ever) she would also threaten me to leave if I hated it so much. I had nowhere to go and just sat and cried. That year left me with a serious case of trust issues and depressed/suicidal thoughts that have just gotten worse for me.\n\nIt kinda just continued as that until fall, when she was upset because I didn't wear shoes outside. Fucking Shoes. She locked me outside and made me rake entire yard alone and didn't let me in until I was done. I was freezing when I got inside. She constantly threatens to go through my stuff and throw out whatever she bought me because she hates how I dress. \n\nBut I never said anything about my mom until February 6th.\n\nI have a brother, age 4 at the time. Who apparently asked me for breakfast when I was getting ready for school. I didn't hear him. I walked out of the house and got in the car. My dad comes out a few minutes later, screaming at me. He's intending to spank me, as that probably won't get him in trouble for child abuse. He misses and hits my lower back. Then my mom starts screaming about how I didn't take care of my brother (I can barely take care of myself) and I just said \"I didn't know\". She drove me to school, wanting to keep up her good reputation with my neighbors who we carpool, and told me to stop crying (later I found out she only wanted me to stop so she wouldn't get in trouble). My homeroom teacher took me to the counselor after I broke down and told him about the events of that morning.\n\nNext thing I knew I was being put on a plan to come back for help and I was sent back to class about an hour later. I had multiple emotional breakdowns that day, being traumatized by the events, thankfully my best friend was there for me (love you bro).\n\nEventually CPS was contacted and I had to talk to someone. They haven't removed me from my parents care, and my mom's behavior is continuing. She's being more strategic with how she attacks me, making sure I can't go to a counselor or the police the next day. \n\nWow that was a long post, but for those who read, thank you.

Was any of this normal?", "author": "shake_flock", "self_text": "Last month, my grandfather died. \u201cGramp\u201d was an incredible man who will be missed so very much. He was the best of us \u2014 a man who loved his wife, never missed a day of work in life, and provided his children, grandchildren, and great-grandchildren with memories and lessons that will never fade. \n\nAfter his funeral, we celebrated his life at my older brother Clyde\u2019s newly purchased house, which also happens to be just a few blocks away from our childhood home. I grew up in a family of six: my parents, my sister, and my two brothers. I was the \u201cmiddle child,\u201d the second of three boys. My sister is about ten years older than Clyde. Our father died two years ago. \n\nI respect the man my older brother has shaped into. I love him and want the best for him at all times, despite his narcissistic tendencies. He\u2019s blowing me out of the water in the \u201cgame\u201d of life and is not afraid to showcase it. I don\u2019t even feel like I\u2019m playing. \n\nSuffering the loss of two of the most important men in our lives has evoked endless childhood memories, some good and bad. The bad are rough flashbacks to moments where I felt extreme emotional distress. The source of the pain was almost always Clyde\u2019s harsh bullying. \n\nClyde picked on me and nobody ever did anything about it. My father was handicapped and absent for the majority of our lives. My mother kept things afloat by working several jobs at once. \n\nClyde\u2019s favorite nickname for me was \u201cfaggot.\u201d His most frequently used adjective was \u201cfat,\u201d even though I was quite skinny throughout the entirety of my youth. \n\nI remember when things got really tough. My sister was on her own by this time. We were poor and had to move in with our grandparents for about a year, using the two unused rooms upstairs in their home. My Mom, younger brother, and Clyde slept in one and I had to sleep in the other alone. \n\nClyde just would not stop making fun of me and attacking my appearance, likes and interests, smell, etc. He hated me and wasn\u2019t afraid to say so. I never fought back but instead begged him to stop. I would shove my face in a pillow and scream blood-curdling howls of distress to try to show him how much it was hurting me.\n\nMy grandfather was big into photography and had many disposable cameras laying around the house. One day, Clyde flipped the script and told me that I looked good. He insisted on taking a picture of me in a pose with my legs crossed and a smile on my face. I really didn\u2019t want to do it, but he absolutely assured me that he was being genuine. \n\nI knew he wasn\u2019t but still agreed, maybe with hopes that playing along would get him to like me. Maybe this could\u2019ve been a really funny moment for all of us (my little brother was playing his usual role as spectator). He snapped the photo and immediately laughed at me, calling me a faggot, saying he would keep the photo as proof of my gayness after the film was developed. I was 11 years old at this time. \n\nBack then, I would isolate and create my own \u201cworlds\u201d by drawing comic books, playing with action figures, and binging video games. I felt safe in solitude, where I could be unbothered and express my interests to an audience of no one. I kept binders filled with comics. I created my own series of characters whose stories would intersect frequently. I would improve as a writer/illustrator over time. I would tease future editions and end on cliffhangers. Nobody read them, except me. I was proud of my stories and planned to release them someday despite my insecurities. I hid them behind my grandfather\u2019s pool table in the basement.\n\nOne day, like any other, I went downstairs to retrieve and revise my work. There was nothing to improve upon, because Clyde ripped everything to shreds and spit on the pile of fiction. A piece of me had been killed. To this day, I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve drawn anything that wasn\u2019t for an art class assignment at school. I still don\u2019t know what Clyde\u2019s motive was for desecrating my beloved hobby, other than perhaps pure contempt. \n\nIn those years, Clyde\u2019s verbal attacks worsened as he started to understand what truly caused me to tick. Repetition and fast-talking were my main bugaboos. I had frequent ear infections as a baby/toddler and needed tubes. Sounds could get under my skin and actually cause what I perceived as physical pain. Misophonia is what it\u2019s called, I believe. Clyde knew this and went on the offensive. \n\n\u201cFatfaggot. Fatfaggot. Fatfaggot. Fatfaggot. Fatfaggot. Fatfaggot. Fatfaggot. Fatfaggot.\u201d \n\nHis mouth was machine gun and his words pierced my well-being. I\u2019d crawl into a ball and cover my ears. He\u2019d beat me around and spit on me for doing that. My younger brother would team up with him on occasion. That\u2019s when I\u2019d feel truly alone, because he was usually an ally of sorts. \n\nOur \u201cplaying doctor\u201d moment came a few years before all of this. Clyde dared me to do something to my \u201cally\u201d that we both very much did not want to do. We caved at the threat of harm from Clyde, and when it was done, he referred to me as a \u201crapist.\u201d He\u2019d pull that one out when all of the other insults had been exhausted. \n\nLater on, towards the teenage years, Clyde did a couple of things to me that I just cannot seem to remove from my memory bank. One of them was on the bus after school. I would obviously sit as far away from Clyde as I could, unless the bus was too full. I remember being forced to sit near him and some of his friends, including a girl he liked. I told them I was his brother. None of them knew and were stunned. I wore thick glasses and didn\u2019t play sports. Clyde had 20/20 vision and could throw the ball a mile. When we got off the bus and walked towards the apartment we were living in at the time, Clyde stopped me, told me to never do it again, and proceeded to beat the shit out of me as others, some my friends, walked by. \n\nThe other was when he found my \u201ctime capsule\u201d  that I buried in the woods. In the capsule, I wrote something that expressed my dreams to become an actor. Clyde shamed and humiliated me for this. He shredded what I had written and punched me. I\u2019ve never taken any steps towards becoming an actor. \n\n I would eventually move away from my mother and two brothers to live with my father for a couple of years. Though I probably spent far too much time alone during those years, my life improved and I even started an award-winning podcast at the age of 15. Dad moved away, forcing me back to my mother\u2019s \u201ccustody\u201d for the rest of high school. I missed a lot, apparently, because now Clyde was his own worst enemy. He was a drug addict, a punk, and a crook. Things got bad fast. Him and I hardly ever spoke a word unless he was asking me for something (I almost always said yes). \n\nEverything came to a head one very traumatic day. Clyde was high and barged into my bedroom. He was about 18 at this point and I was 16. I didn\u2019t understand much about the drugs at the time, but I knew something was off. He was being incredibly nice and talkative to me. We spent a few hours playing video games and chatting. He kept getting up, walking around, scratching himself and talked manically. Even though I knew he wasn\u2019t himself and that this wouldn\u2019t last, I pathetically went along with things and tried treating this as a much-needed bonding moment. \n\nEventually, we had to go pick my mother up from work (sometimes she let Clyde have the car for the day). I had my license and could drive, and begged Clyde to let me. He was getting more and more manic, almost as if the high had a second wave. Reluctantly, he agreed and tossed me the keys.\n\nAs soon as my mother saw us both in the car, she knew something was wrong. We picked up some dinner and headed home. She knew Clyde was high. \n\nWe got home and instead of eating, my mother called him out. Clyde flipped out and was now violently out of control, screaming at her and making her cry. He stole the keys and took off in her car. I unsuccessfully tried to stop him. My poor mother cried and didn\u2019t know what to do. Clyde sped off in a way that made me think he was about to crash and die. I paced outside in the apartment complex parking lot, unsure if I should call the police. I phoned my father a thousand miles away and he told me that he couldn\u2019t help. I decided to call 911. Clyde did end up coming back safe and was arrested. \n\nI\u2019m not so sure why I did this, but I walked up to Clyde when he was in the back of one of the police cars. I told him that his incarceration would be justice for EVERYTHING. He spat at me. Most of it missed.\n\nAll of this happened a few days before my older sister\u2019s wedding. My brothers and I were in the wedding, and Clyde had to be there no matter what. It would\u2019ve been ruined without him. Charges were pressed, so Clyde was in the slammer for several days. His bail was around $1,100. \n\nMy sister and I went half-and-half to get him out. He made the wedding, at which we had zero dialogue regarding the preceding events. \n\nToday, Clyde has been sober for nearly a decade. His comeback has been nothing short of a miracle. He makes more money than anyone I know, and he didn\u2019t even attend college. He\u2019s the shining star of the family who doesn\u2019t wear diapers. \n\nI\u2019m one of the, if not the, biggest disappointment. Much of my family expected great things from me when I was younger. Some thought I\u2019d be able to do whatever I wanted. My grandfather was one of them. \n\nI want the wounds to heal, but feel as if they can\u2019t without an apology of some sort from Clyde. He is my brother. I will always love him. But I saw shrinks as a child because of his cruelty. Perhaps the \u201cunnatural\u201d end of our childhood relationship was on my side. Maybe it\u2019s harsh to pin the blame on him, considering that Clyde was a kid too. He should\u2019ve been stopped and punished by an adult.", "subreddit": "abuse"}

He did lie, and I do think he tried (successfully) to manipulate me a lot. He put me down subtly almost everyday. Anytime I tried to have a real discussion, he would make me feel stupid for even bringing it up so I stopped. \n\nMaybe it was my fault. He was the first person I ever had real feelings for.

Maybe he did have feelings and they just faded away. Maybe he did just want to be friends, then we grew apart and I tried too hard keep him because he was my best friend.

I really truly did consider him one of my best friends, and he made me think he felt the same way too. I know he\u2019s not a good person. But I also know that I did care for him a lot. I genuinely wanted the best for him. I know I did things wrong but I know I would have never done anything to try to hurt him, and if I did I always apologized. I don\u2019t think any of it was worth him trying to make me feel worthless. \n\nMaybe he did care about me, maybe he never did. Maybe it was my fault, maybe it was his, maybe it was both. I\u2019m not sure. All I know is my heart is broken because I lost someone I considered my very best friend, and I know he does not miss me at all. I appreciate anyone who took the time to read this.

One year ago, I blocked her on everything, deleted/blocked her number and deleted every last photo of her. Or, so I thought. I opened the album. I had four pictures staring me right in the face. Two of them being my absolute favorite pictures of us. Her face looked so sweet and she looked so happy, as did I. I know she\u2019s a compete monster, but my greatest fears were realized: she\u2019s still the most beautiful thing in the world to me, physically. I lingered on the one picture and longed to plant a kiss on her beautiful, luscious lips just once more...\n\nI knew what I had to do...I deleted them permanently and triple checked all of my other Facebook albums.

My two closest friends and family members know, and support and help me when things get rough and listen to me when i vent, but I just feel like I should put my experience out here. Partly as a way to vent and just have it out there, but also because when I looked for people similar to me, I couldn't find much, so I hope this helps anyone in my shoes. \n\nSo, backstory. I had a pretty fucked childhood, surprise surprise. My early childhood was mainly just being bulled and having no friends and I'm not 100% sure why. The schools around there sucked, so did the people, I was pretty overweight too, and more things so I can't really say, but I still have some stuff from that. Mostly though it starts around when I was like 8? My mom and I moved out of my Gma's house and into this small ass town and I went to two schools there, both private Christian schools and the bullying was way worse there. Same reasons, plus the fact my mom was raising me by herself. Also I was around 230+ lbs. Short version, I was beat up once, got bullied, and had one friend but then she moved away. Out of school, my mom had a boyfriend who would tease me repeatedly for my weight and pinned me to the floor once which scared the shit out of me and beat my mom once when I was asleep, they broke up after that (Btw he used to be in the military). My father wasn't better, he's was/is an alcoholic and I saw him beat his girlfriends in front of me multiple times. And yes they weren't good to me either since one said I looked pregnant once and called me an entitled brat when she though I was sleeping (I was still around 8 btw). I still would never have wished to see them get hurt like that by him though. Anyways, throughout all this my mom was a drug addict and I had to stop her from doing dangerous shit all the time among other shit. Sometimes she would be too out of it and I would just eat bread plain bc I couldn't open the canned food we had an it was the only thing we had. One time I went out to get groceries bc my cousin was with us and I felt responsible if we didn't have food but then a police officer had to bring me home and I was the one blamed for trying to get food and being left home alone.\n\nAnyways, this end part is where things start to get better so maybe this will show that things don't stay horrible forever. I finally had enough and switched to online school and begged for us to move back with my Gma and we did. I stayed in that school for 2 years and during that time I didn't talk to anyone my age, or really anyone. However, I did lose the weight and I told myself that once I did I would go back to school and try to make friends. I did and then begged for us to move back out to another house we have that was very far away. We did and it was the summer when we got there and since I've only had one friend and that didn't last long I was nervous and would literally look up how to speak to people and basically how to be normal? I went and I tried to speak to people but I couldn't find out how, literally. I went months w/o friends and I would wonder what was wrong with me, but eventually I found a group of people I am still friends with and they really helped me socialize and learn what was normal and what wasn't. I know that sounds weird but when you've never had friends you really don't know how to act or what to do or say and it really leaves you feeling almost alienated and degraded in a way. My mom still was/is a drug addict and that still hurts and is difficult to deal with but my friends and living with my family really helped and I'm in a way better place emotionally and mentally. Not that I still don't have anxiety or sometimes disassociate. I'm still forced to visit my father but I've gotten better at dealing with him while I'm there. I don't see either of them getting better but their health isn't the best so I just try to look out for myself while being near them and trying to make of it what I can so I can sleep at night.\n\nYeah, that was really long, but what I want to say to people who never really had friends or whose both side of the family was fucked or who was overweight as a kid or who had to deal with fucked up boyfriends/girlfriends of parents or who still live with fucked up parents that things get better. You will learn to make friends, you will lose the weight if you want to, you will find people who help you, even if you have to be around those fucked up parents for now you can still heal and things will not stay the same forever.", "subreddit": "abuse"}

But then I started questioning about this girl and he got really mad, told me I blew my chance with him, and told me to leave him alone. \n\nAt the time, I specifically asked if he was seeing anyone - I had a bad feeling about a girl on social media (who turned out to be his new gf lol). And he said no. \n\nHe kept telling me to leave him the fuck alone. Now I know it\u2019s cus he had a new girl. A real one in his country. No need to have me around. \n\nKept saying he didn\u2019t care. Now I know why. \n\nSo I questioned him yesterday. How can you tell me you weren\u2019t trying it with anyone then three days later be in a RELATIONSHIP. Not just dating, a relationship. That doesn\u2019t add up. \n\nI got all the following\n* \u201cI don\u2019t need to explain myself to you\u201d\n* \u201cWell look at how you react\u201d\n* \u201cI wasn\u2019t WITH anyone\u201d\n* \u201cYou had no right to know what was going on with her. We were done.\u201d\n* \u201cLeave me alone\u201d\n\nSo I asked why he lied. Just got more of the above. So now I feel like shit. \n\nBtw, I did everything perfectly. I went absolutely batshit crazy. \n\nHe kept ignoring my messages. This was when he spent the whole of our relationship telling me if his exes messaged him he would reply out of courtesy. But not me apparently!\n\n \u201cI don\u2019t want to talk to you. Leave me alone\u201d\n\nEven though I just wanted to ask. \n\nHe kept ignoring, blocking unblocking. \n\nI did ALL the crazy stuff I hadn\u2019t done in YEARS. So many missed calls and messages. I was absolutely desperate. \n\nHe just kept telling me to leave him alone and he\u2019s moved on with the new girl now. He never showed me that kind of loyalty. \n\nI know he\u2019s already told her I\u2019m crazy. \n\nI messaged her. Then deleted it. She blocked me. He\u2019s obviously prepped her already. He blocked and unblocked me. \n\nHe told me he was going to the cops. He\u2019d been on/off answering me for hours then stopped. I begged why he couldn\u2019t treat me with some decency. I begged him I would stop, just please assure me we will leave it at that. \n\nHe hasn\u2019t replied. So I\u2019m sitting here, terrified that he\u2019s called the cops because of all my messaging etc. \n\nI\u2019m so absolutely broken. I\u2019ve just played into the crazy psycho ex role absolutely perfectly and just pushed them together. I\u2019ve given him so much supply and I\u2019m here absolutely broken and feeling so shit it is unreal. \n\nHe didn\u2019t give me answers. Again. \n\nAnd I\u2019m questioning everything. \n\nAnd I feel like I\u2019ve erased all the progress I\u2019ve made. I feel so crazy. I hadn\u2019t reached this level of rock bottom for years. \n\nNow I realise he must have been trying it with this girl for ages. Definitely when he was \u201cwith\u201d me. So he strung me along, devaluing me while finding her. And now she gets everything I wanted. \n\nThat\u2019s why he stopped saying he loved me and started saying I trapped him in the relationship. \n\nHe blamed EVERYTHING on me, told me it was my fault, to leave him alone, that I made him want to move on. But it\u2019s pretty obvious to me he was moving on anyway. \n\nI hate myself. I\u2019ve done everything I shouldn\u2019t. I\u2019ve acted crazy and now he\u2019s apparently going to the cops.

The problem I think is my mom. My friends and boyfriend think that my mom is emotionally abusive. She is regularly insulting me and how I look, dress, act, etc. She tracks me and my driving on my phone and I am 17 years old and I have to tell her where I am at all times. Nothing I ever say is right and as soon as I speak up for myself in a fight she leaves and gives me the silent treatments, for days, weeks, or sometimes up to a month. She and I have a rocky relationship bc she has severe depression and i\u2019m really the only person she to talks to bc my dad and her hate eachother. When I make a mistake she blames it on me and how it\u2019s affecting her mental health. She says I don\u2019t do enough for the family and I focus on my own mental health too much. I drive my brother everywhere, pay for his food, appts, etc. And she won\u2019t allow me to get a job. She is supposed to be paying me for teaching and helping at the dance studio but she hasn\u2019t yet. She has my bank account linked with hers so she can take out money whenever she wants. I ran out of cash so i had to trade her mcdonald\u2019s gift cards for cash and start selling my clothes on social media. I\u2019ve been staying out of the house as much as possible to avoid her bc i\u2019m afraid of her most of the time. She calls my little brother really awful names and he even told me last year she\u2019s emotionally abusive but i assured him she wasn\u2019t. Now i\u2019m starting to question it after my psych major friend said she\u2019s known my mom was emotionally abusive since she used to come into the dance studio when i was little and say i was fat and ask how i could be skinnier and better.

Then it hit me - his actions, his words, his staying overnight at the hotel he worked at (just four miles from our home) because he had to \"work late\" and be back \"early\" the next morning all made sense (and I don't recall him taking an extra bag with him when he left for work). He was cheating. I don't doubt that now. He worked with her. Very closely. She was essentially his assistant - and the moment I met her (months before we split) I just had this feeling that something was going to happen. A month after our divorce was final he told me they were together. That was all the confirmation I needed. Why the fuck would you get together with the woman you denied you were having an affair with multiple times immediately after a divorce? He denies any wrongdoing, but has told me on multiple occasions that I drove him to her because we fought every time he brought up his job and that they could talk about work together.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy ex \"worked\" over 90 hours a week. Our son was maybe 7 or 8 months old. I worked a full-time job, cared for him, took care of our pets, and the house all while battling post-partum ( a thing he refused to see as something real). Then one day - during the first two weeks of our separation - he \"lost\" his wedding band. Said he must have lost it at his mother's house where he was staying during our trial separation. Swore up and down he tried to look for it and couldn't find it. On my way to work today, I realized he probably did lose it. However, I think he left it in the hotel room where he slept with her. Or perhaps her apartment. I am sure he took it off and forgot about it. And I am just shocked that I didn't think of this before. I mean, why else would he take it off if he said he wanted to work on us? I took mine off for a short time and put it back on. It never left my sight. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe moment this realization hit me, I wanted to message him. But I didn't because I know that it won't matter. He is a textbook narcissist and hates it when his horrible actions are brought to light. I won't get any satisfaction. I won't get anything but another fight and then being stonewalled. It won't be worth it. Which is why I am laying it all out here so I can get this off my chest and move on.", "subreddit": "NarcissisticAbuse"}

But one thing I have found consistently is that the pain caused comes out in small increments.\n\nI feel it in my chest, my arms and my stomach- I know that it\u2019s there, it\u2019s heavy and dulling. Sometimes it bubbles up to the surface; if I\u2019ve had a particularly bad day, I can\u2019t sleep or in-between doing things when my mind isn\u2019t so distracted. I know there is so much pain there. \n\nI\u2019m not comfortable with just crying. I don\u2019t know why. I mean I did it every day of our 3 year relationship. Uncontrollably. But with healing from it (and past instances prior to nex) I just don\u2019t feel comfortable crying and letting it all out. I can only let small parts of pain escape at a time. So I will mildly engage in thoughts about what happened/what I could have done/should have said/what could still happen and how I\u2019d approach it. And I let my emotions come up enough just to to let the tears fall out of my eyes, but I catch them before they stream down my face and never let myself fully sob.\n\nI feel like if I give in to the pain and just let it all out - just cry, scream, whatever - I\u2019m really scared, terrified almost, that I will get stuck in that pain. I don\u2019t know why, I just feel like there\u2019s a massive possibility that if I let myself feel it all I will get stuck there. I know that when I did cry when I was in the relationship and how I did feel at that time was a place I never want to return to. I wanted to die every single day. I can\u2019t risk going back to that place because I don\u2019t know how I would get back out of it. I don\u2019t know how I did to begin with. All I learnt was how to avoid it. \n\nI have felt my psyche snap - literally. I have had what felt like an episode of psychosis. Intrusive thoughts. Dissociating; feeling outside of my body and like life isn\u2019t real. I have felt so low that even talking or moving was more than I could handle - I had just about enough energy to move my eyes across the room. I have tried to take my own life. \n\nI have experienced what it feels like to be on the dark side of my psyche and so I KNOW what there is to be terrified of. I\u2019m scared of myself I guess is what I\u2019m trying to say. But I want to heal, but I\u2019m scared of my pain. \n\nEven if I try to let myself feel it - I will be able to let the thoughts and emotions come up for around 10 minutes max and then I will get what feels like a literal physical block in my mind. I just can\u2019t go any further. Not I won\u2019t or don\u2019t want to - I *can\u2019t*! I feel like my body is saying\n\u201cWoah this is too much to handle and will flood your whole system, you don\u2019t want to go there\u201d.

I feel like if I let it out they\u2019re gonna have to lock me up and throw away the key for a long time. Because I don\u2019t see it all being put back in a box to revisit when I have more time. Or being contained again so I can go about my daily work/family and social life.

As far back as I can remember, she has ignored my needs. She fed me, clothed me, all the basics. Even helped me with homework. but as far as support goes I didn't have much; most of that went to my younger autistic brother. I did everything to get her attention: got high A's in school, got in trouble and severely punished, and went so far as to clean off the dining room table so we could have family meals. But in middle school, she went from ignoring me to monitoring me. If I didn't have a's I was grounded, if I didn't help my brother with simple basic tasks (he's high functioning and very able to do anything a normal person can, it just takes a bit longer), or if I said anything against her, I was grounded.

If I move out she's going to remove any financial support like insurance or medical expenses, she won't let me touch my car, and she won't ever talk to me on her own initiative.

I\u2019m also really interested in hearing other people\u2019s experiences, so please blow this post up if possible. All thoughts and comments are welcome though. This is gonna be kind of a long post, so please bear with me. L\n\nBefore I get into the abuse i suffered as a kid at the hands of my parents, I wanted to kind of describe myself a little bit when I was still a kid.\nI was always a very bright and precocious child. Straight A\u2019s without trying, advanced courses, winning spelling bee\u2019s and reading bee\u2019s left and right. While my parents dogged my brother about his grades, they went to tons of assemblies to watch me succeed. Before the fighting got really bad, I interacted with my peers all the time. I wasn\u2019t the most extroverted kid, but  nobody really disliked me, since I always had something witty to say. I kept a tight group of 2 or 3 friends and that was all I needed. Always did well in school without even trying... and now that I\u2019ve been living on my own going to college for 3 years, I can barely be fucked to do the minimum amount of coursework to pass my classes. I actively avoid talking to my classmates whenever possible, and have only made 1 friend from my classes. I wake up dreading to have to get out of bed, and I go to bed dreading having to wake up. I smoke weed or drink almost every single night because I\u2019m tired of being sober and listening to my self-deprecating thoughts all the time. \n\nOk, time for the actual body of this post:\nI have been living on my own for about 3 years now, ever since I graduated high school. I never got along very well with my parents or brother and for pretty much the entire time I was in high school we did nothing but fight all the time. My mom had some pretty impulsive anger issues and that often caused fights to get physical or end with destroying something of mine (usually expensive). My dad didn\u2019t have the same level of anger issues, but he would never stop my mom once she got into a rage.\n\nThese fights we got into often started off pretty innocent (not doing dishes, taking a pop out of the fridge without asking) but would spiral out of control since both sides would constantly add more fuel to it without trying to defuse the situation. I was by no means an \u201ceasy child\u201d,  but by comparing my punishments with some of my friends\u2019 I know I wasn\u2019t a wild child either. I once had a steak knife thrown at me for a fight that started over cleaning my room. If I hadn\u2019t used my laptop to defend myself, I probably would have been impaled (she broke my laptop without paying for it, but given the circumstances I guess I\u2019m lucky). Some of the weirder and more extreme punishments are listed here:\n\n1) I was pulled off of academic quiz team right before our final competition, because I \u201cenjoyed it too much\u201d and they \u201chad no other way to punish me\u201d. I think this was after I refused to sit with them at one of the marching band banquets, and chose to sit with my friends instead\n\n2) I had my ping pong table flipped in half right in front of me for mouthing off about staying out after curfew\n\n3) pulled off of a marching band spring break vacation that I had already paid for myself. My mother then used the 1000$ I lost as an incentive to behave, then never gave it back.\n\n4) grounded and sequestered to my room (without a door) for 4 months. No screens, no friends, not even a book left in my room and a major ass beating to top it all off. It was actually the worst 4 months of my life. All because I got caught smoking weed.\n\nThese are just the examples that come to mind immediately. There\u2019s a shit ton of others that I\u2019m sure I can\u2019t remember, as well as a lot of more usual behaviors out of excessively strict parents.\n\nNeedless to say I tried not to interact with them whenever possible. Also, my mom loved to talk shit about me to the extended family, often making me sound like some sort of heartless evil monster. As a result, I pretty much only liked spending time with my grandparents. I stayed in my room, watched YouTube videos, played video games, and tried to be out of the house as much as possible. However, being grounded all the time stunted my social skills badly. I could never join clubs because we lived 6 miles from school which means I would rely on rides to get to and from meetings and practices. When we moved to a new school district from 7-8th grade, I ate lunch in the bathroom every single day because I couldn\u2019t make any friends. I was constantly stressed and tired from the fighting and I didn\u2019t want to talk about my home life at school. School was always my escape from home and I liked the separation.\n\nMy depression and apathy really started kicking in my junior year of high school. Nobody suspected a thing since my academics didn\u2019t take a plunge in the slightest, but I never had to work very hard in school in the first place. I was great at putting on a facade and pretending everything was ok so nobody ever questioned me about it and I guess I kind of liked it that way. It was a super fucked situation that\u2019s hard to explain now, much less 4 years ago. I just wanted to be normal and fit in so badly and I worried that talking about these things would just alienate them from me.\n\nFinally, my graduation date came. I had a 4.3 GPA, Summa Cum Laude, 15 AP credits that earned me a LOT of college credit and solid scholarships from my school choices. On the day of the ceremony I was very sick and said that I didn\u2019t want to go. I actually called my dad to pick me up early and take me home, and he put my mom on the phone so she could yell at me about \u201chow ungrateful I was after everything they did for me in school\u201d. At this point I was fuming, because we already had been fighting for weeks leading up to graduation. I retorted with something along the lines of \u201cif this ceremony is for the people who helped me through school, then you shouldn\u2019t show up\u201d and hung up the phone. \n\nCeremony goes by, I walk onstage just feeling underwhelmed and nauseated. I get my degree and leave the auditorium once everyone is dismissed. When I see my parents, my mom is oddly calm but I realize it\u2019s only because my grandma came and wanted to get some pictures. As soon as we\u2019re in the car she starts screaming and crying like usual. 20 minutes of arguing later, she told me I have until the end of the month to pack up my shit and leave. \nAt this point in my life, I\u2019m 18 years old, working part-time as a lifeguard making minimum wage. I have no car, less than 1000$ in savings, about to start college and no idea where to sleep. I still figured sleeping on the streets would be better than dealing with my mother\u2019s banshee screaming and unpredictable violence. \n\nOver the next couple months I started working as a server to make more money, and bounced from couch to couch at friends\u2019 houses. I was too proud to ask to stay for more than a few weeks at a time, until I confided with my childhood friend about my situation. We had grown a little apart, but the love was still there, and without their kindness I probably would have ended my life years ago. They had already long since accepted me as one of their family (I was friends with him before either of his sisters were even born), but staying on their couch for 7 months was probably the closest thing I\u2019ve experienced to having a real and functional family. I took those 7 months to finish my first semester of my computer engineering degree, save up some money and move out to a shitty off-campus apartment. \n\nThe entire first 2 years of college I was either working full-time with a full load of classes or working 2 jobs to save up money for rent and school. I used my restaurant job to feed me regularly by snagging extra food, I stayed up late every night studying, working, and doing homework. My grades were good, and although I was tired and stressed I felt good too. I didn\u2019t make many friends simply because I sprinted from classes to work, and had no free time for clubs. It was probably around this time where I got a lot heavier into drug use. It went from a ~very~ occasional occurrence, to once a week, to multiple times a week and recently almost every day. It started as a way to make my feet hurt less after a 12-hour shift, or a way to loosen up at a social event, but over time it just became habit\n\nIt was also during this time that I \u201creconnected\u201d with my parents. I got into a really bad car accident and totaled my car and I called asking for insurance information. My dad refused and sent my mom to meet me instead. I wasn\u2019t really unhappy to see them... but I wasn\u2019t happy to see them either. At this point I spent an entire year growing on my own and now I\u2019m face to face with my abusers again. What struck me was how weird of an experience it is to face your abusers after their power to abuse is gone... the people I had looked at with nothing but fear and resentment for so long no longer had the ability to make me feel that way. We had a significant history together which would repeat no more. Thus, I was intensely apathetic about them, while my mom at least pretended to feel bad for what she did. I held ALL the power now, and I wasn\u2019t sure how to use it. They knew i would be fine never hearing from them again, so the onus was on them to repair the damage they caused.\nNeedless to say they did an extremely poor job at it. But, being a 19-year old who spent the better part of 5 years actively despising these people, I guess I just ran out of anger.  I\u2019m never going to forget the abuse and getting kicked out, nor will I forgive it, but rather I just \u201cgot over\u201d it. It\u2019s something that happened and can\u2019t change. Since it wasn\u2019t going to happen anymore, that was the attitude I adopted.\n\nThe hard times are gone now, and have been for a while now. I saved enough money to only have to work 1 job OR go to classes, not both. I have savings, I made a very good group of friends and it seems like things should be turning up.\n\nBut I feel so empty inside. I should be happy that my life will probably never be that hard again. I\u2019m more than halfway through college and my academic freedom is within reach... and the thought is terrifying. I don\u2019t care about anything anymore, barely even myself. I still don\u2019t know how to talk about my problems because I\u2019m convinced it sounds like whining and nobody cares (which I know is bullshit, but it\u2019s a weirdly strong kind of social anxiety). I try going to talk therapy but It seems pointless. I\u2019ve never been one to seek approval from others and talking about my problems and thoughts makes me uncomfortable. I don\u2019t have any passion left for what I\u2019m studying because I hated all the internships I had, and at this point I\u2019m convinced I can\u2019t work a desk job for a career. I\u2019m thoroughly convinced I\u2019m a failure and I can\u2019t derail the train of apathetic and depressive thoughts; rather, that very train is derailing ME.\n\nI\u2019ve spent so long being alone and trying to find some sort of happiness that it sometimes feels like I\u2019ll never really be able to trust and care about someone. There\u2019s nobody in my life who can relate to what I\u2019ve been through, and I\u2019m losing all motivation to try to find them. Even while I was staying on my friends couch, I felt lonely, albeit less so than when I actually was alone. Sitting down with their family for dinner a few nights a week just wasn\u2019t enough to overcome years and years of isolation.\n\nI think this post was half-rant and half cry for help. It was a little cathartic to write, but overall I\u2019m just scared and confused and tired.\n\nTL:DR: I was kicked out of my house after graduation after years of abuse and fighting with my parents. After living on my own for 3 years and \u201cmaking up\u201d with them, I feel less motivated and more lonely than ever", "subreddit": "abuse"}

No wonder I lost my memory so many times. The world i have been stuck in has been that times a billion. No wonder I\u2019ve been mostly dead since I was forced to be near them again.

I came into the relationship at 23 (F), wanting love and commitment. He was 29, wanting a pretty thing to project on and torment. I met him at a coffee shop where he was working. One of the first things he said to me was an offhand remark: \"Oh, you just moved to town. I'm sorry for you because I'm going to take advantage of you.\" At the time, I thought it was a silly thing to say. But it was exactly what he did.\n\n*At least in my mind.* Sometimes I doubt myself, and think maybe *I* was the unreasonable one for trying again and again for that loving relationship I wanted so bad, where he would meet my family, take care of me, travel with me, live with me.\n\nI've gone NC with him several times before and failed but this is the first time I have actually blocked him on **EVERYTHING**. I also deleted all my social media AND moved (45 min away, but in August I have a job lined up outside the lower 48) so now I'll never run into him again like I used to (except if I go back into town to celebrate my graduation with my friends next week, which I'm tentative about because I want no chance of seeing him).  I'm about 18 days into it.  \n\nI have this strange feeling this time where I feel pure relief and no heartbreak. But yet I hurt.  Maybe it's a sense of loss, or nostalgia, or frustration at being too scared to date again. And maybe it's all the self-doubt I have been left with that I was just as fucked up as he was the whole time. How could I let *him* happen to me?\n\nI have analyzed our relationship so many times I'm left tired of it and can barely stand to think of it or him anymore.

Veteran. We hit it off. He was endearingly awkward, I'm hardly a social butterfly myself. Date 3 was weird - he was in a text battle with his ex who had suddenly stopped him having contact with his daughter. We had sex but halfway through, he stopped saying his ex had messed with his head. He had what he later explained as an Aspergers meltdown, was pretty grim to me, next day full of apologies. Tuned into my empathy (I work supporting women in the criminal justice system- full on, very demanding). Then all his problems came forth. He isn't getting any support, the local authority are against him because he spoke out about a local veteran's charity, they're smearing him, his ex is smearing him because she's a psycho, it's a conspiracy,  posh boy's network, freemasonry,  corruption blah blah. He just wanted to do something good and they're all against him. He was SO convincing, so utterly plausible.  He was full of sadness because he just wants to see his daughter because he just loves her so much. Pleaded with me to help, he couldn't cope, his autism made dealing with anything official so hard. \n\nSo I did an Aspergers crash course. Read all I could. When he was arrested and charged with leaving abusive messages to his ex, she had pushed him into it. Yeah, I feel really stupid right now.  He reconnected with his mother, who he hadn't spoken to in 2 years. Wanted her help to put things right with all that was wrong in his life. One minute all \"help me\", the next calling her all the vile names and blaming her for everything, the next asking her for money. His father had been very abusive to his mother and him - this much is true.\n\nI stuck in there. My instinct is to help anyone in need and he was so good at the victim act. I researched, I wrote letters, I went to meetings with him because he said he couldn't manage on his own. Took time off work trying to get him some support. When I contracted glandular fever, he was only interested in how long I'd be contagious. It was only ever about him. Accommodating him and his autism. \n\nHe bullied his mother into driving 400 miles to help him. He had her in tears daily. I still was stupidly fooled that this was 'just' his Aspergers. He very subtly talked me into things. Poor him, it would really cheer him up.... Nothing we did was enough. I lent him money, bought him shopping. He was full of all the marvellous things he could do, given the opportunity. Like REALLY marvellous things. He was amazing! He had a special insight into the world, no one understood things on the level he did!  When I refused to do something because I was exhausted, he went tits. Shouted that he shouldn't have to spend time with someone who let people treat him so poorly, let alone have to have sex with them. Next day he was full of apologies- he didn't mean it, he was overwhelmed, things come out of his mouth that he has no awareness of, poor him. I forgave him. He interrupted me constantly, and if he didn't, he'd wait until I finished before patiently explaining to me why I was wrong.\n\nBad stuff happened again last week. I was emotionally and physically drained by this point. Everything was about him, he never asked how I was, told me my job made me too tired.  Everyone was against him, his problems were far greater than mine. The stress of trying to juggle him and my job was killing me. I was quieter, less enthusiastic about seeing him, was starting to feel resentment  - and he made me feel guilty about it. Life was so much more difficult for him, what with him being ganged up on, being autistic, depressed, kept from his child? Didn't I know that that's the leading cause of suicide in men his age?  I understood him better than anyone, I was so easy to be around. Then he flipped again, telling me once more that he shouldn't have to have sex with someone like me, he shouldn't have to tolerate being around me. \n\nI had an inkling he was a narcissist but the lines between autism and narcissism can be blurry. I messaged him telling him that what he had said was unacceptable and that he needed to address his mental health. He responded that the only thing wrong with him was that he was being systematically abused by the system and everyone was in cahoots to keep him from his daughter.  No apology. No accountability. I knew then that this was not Aspergers. His mother told me he was sending her emails blaming her for everything, calling her vile names and wishing her dead. She was done. \n\nTonight left me in no doubt of what the real problem was. The email came, using everything I'd confided in him against me. Saying I was a narcissist who had used him (for what? He literally did nothing for me). Told me that once I accepted that I was mentally ill, I'd understand where I'd gone wrong with him. I was discarded.\n\nI'm reeling. Not because he's a pig who used me and tossed me aside, but because I let myself be so manipulated. I defended him, even to myself. I have been manipulated, used and when he realised I'd rumbled him, I was tossed aside. He has drained me totally.  I've been off work all week, sleeping at least 16 hours a day, not eating, barely functioning. Not tonight though. Tonight I can't sleep, thinking about what an idiot I've been.  His own mum told me to never let him back in, that he's an abuser who manipulates people and that she's ashamed to call him her son.  \n\nWhat the actual hell. I'm free, I  know, but how do I forgive myself?", "subreddit": "NarcissisticAbuse"}

So many stories on this sub have helped me cope with my current situation. I hope my story can help maybe just one person out there. \n\n***\u201cKick the door down when you come, tear the roof of when you leave.\u201d***\n\nShe came into my life like a flash of lightning; powerful and electric. Nothing would be ever be the same again. Together we shared our hopes and dreams; ten years, two daughters and a home. Could this be real? Could I be so fortunate to find this kind of love, to find such an amazing woman and partner? Or perhaps this amazing person found me?  After seven years of marriage she was gone just as quickly as she came. \n\nIn the beginning I did all I could to express how much she meant to me, how much I loved and appreciated her in my life. Was it ever enough; flowers, jewelry, letters, did she even care, did she ever say thank you? Over time a lack of gratitude and appreciation was met with a lack of effort in regards to material things. I never stopped trying, I just tried to show her in different ways through different actions. She made me want more, to expect more of myself for her and our future together. I had to become a better man for her. \n\nAfter Grad school we got married. It was the happiest day of my life. That day, a day that I\u2019ll never forget turned bittersweet after the ceremony and celebration had ended. When we were finally alone together on our wedding night; did she express any happiness, any joy? Perhaps she was just tired from a long day? \n\n***\u201cI burn down time trying to find a way to get through to you. I know I am standing in line for a hand out, it'll never come\u201d*** \n\nOur life together has not worked out the way we planned, we\u2019ve struggled. However, after two beautiful daughters and a mortgage on our family home, together we\u2019ve been blessed with a good life. Could I really be this fortunate? Is she happy in this life, in this marriage? I worked hard, sometimes fifteen hours a day, five six days a week so she can stay home to raise our girls. Maybe it\u2019s me, maybe I sacrifice too much time working or maybe I just don\u2019t make enough money? Maybe she\u2019d be happier if I was home more to help with the kids? I do miss my wife, even when she\u2019s laying in bed right next to me. I miss our conversations, our laughter. How do you start a conversation with the love of your life? Such a strange an ironic situation, my wife has become a complete stranger to me. \n\n***\u201cI never knew that everything was falling through. I wish you were a stranger; I could disengage\u2026 Find another friend, and you discard.*** ***And suddenly I become a part of your past.\u201d*** \n\nIn the end, we hadn\u2019t had a conversation in months. Our life had become an uncomfortable routine. She sacrificed to raise our girls, I sacrificed time away for a job I despise and company that doesn\u2019t value me. But it\u2019s all for a greater good, right? Daily rituals and social pleasantries dissipated. I would leave for work before anyone was up. I\u2019d check on the girls and kiss them goodbye, they\u2019d be in bed by the time I got home. When I arrived home for the night my wife would usually be on the phone, social media, shopping, texting, I don\u2019t know. I\u2019d try to start a conversation by asking about her day\u2026 Did she care about mine? Maybe she was just tired from a long day with the kids? Maybe she was just too tired or distracted to ask or even care? \n\nAbout a year ago my wife said she wanted to get a part time job. At the time I thought perhaps some time out of the house, away from the kids and grind of being a stay at home mom would be good for her mental well being. At this point the kids were old enough for a babysitter and could tell us if something was wrong. My wife found a job at a brewery/restaurant, not ideal but she said it was good money and accommodating hours. She has a Master\u2019s Degree and chose the late night hours and night life. I\u2019m sure it was just an opportunity to socialize and make a little money? Or maybe she likes the attention? This part time job turned into her not coming home before 4:00 am four to five times a week. The girls started asking for their mom\u2026 but the late nights make it difficult for her to get up in the morning to get the girls ready for school.  I try to express my concerns to her without confrontation or lack of support. I mean she is right, I can be \"dramatic and sensitive.\" I shouldn\u2019t let her 4:30 am conversations and texts bother me, that\u2019s just me being \u201ccrazy.\u201d After all \u201che\u2019s just a friend from work.\u201d \u201cHow come I don\u2019t trust her?\u201d I\u2019m still unclear on how concerns about keeping late hours in regards to our daughters turns into trust issues\u2026\n\n***\u201cI found peace in your violence.*** ***Can't tell me there's no point in trying. I'm so used to being in the wrong, I'm tired of caring. Loving never gave me a home, so I'll sit here in the silence.\u201d***\n\nI wanted to support my wife, her ambitions, interests, desires and endeavors. We are partners, equals in the family sense but she is the better part of me. She is sociable, witty, charismatic, funny, and sarcastic, everything that I am not. But something was off, something changed, something was different.  When the phone would ring she would light up, turn on the charm and become the person I married. But when we were alone she became gloomy and brooding.  She would just stare at me, silent, with long glaring looks of disdain, like I was responsible for every bad thing that\u2019s ever happened to her in life. At this point her parents had been offering me more criticism than usual, typical stuff like \u201chave more confidence,\u201d \u201cbelieve in yourself,\u201d \u201cgive yourself credit.\u201d And then it became\u201d you need to make more money,\u201d \u201cget a better job,\u201d \u201cour daughter shouldn\u2019t have to work at a restaurant to support her family.\u201d What was she telling her parents? \n\nWas it me? Was it my fault she was working in a bar, or was it her choice? Was it my fault she wasn\u2019t coming home before 2:30 am for weeks on end with two small children at home, even when she wasn\u2019t working? Was it my fault she was going out of town for days with a \u201cfriend from work?\u201d I mean I tried to talk to her about this stuff but I didn\u2019t want to argue or fight, it wasn\u2019t worth it. Was it worth expressing my opinion to endure the name calling, manipulations and silent treatment? Can I even defend myself against my wife\u2019s allegations and accusations? Defend myself to her, to her parents, to her family, her friends? What was happening? What\u2019s happening to my family? Who is this person my wife has become? How could she do and say these things against me? If there\u2019s one thing I ever do in this life it is without question make every effort and fight until my dying breath for my family. I have to at least try, right? \u201cIn sickness and in health,\u201d is she sick? \n\n***\u201cIt may be over but it won't stop there, I am here for you if you'd only care. I am a dreamer but when I wake\u2026 You can't break my spirit - it's my dreams you take.\u201d***\n\nThe woman I fell in love with, the woman I married and had children with\u2026 the woman I chose is gone. Our home is gone. She took everything. She took my: family, daughters, dreams, ambitions, love, dignity, confidence, happiness and laughter. I never knew how fragile it all was. I never knew how easily and how quickly it can all be ripped away.  I never knew what a covert narcissist was or if she is in fact one.  How long before she moved out had she moved on? We are still married but she is with another man now, a new supply. However, that hasn\u2019t stopped the verbal assaults. It hasn\u2019t stopped her blame-shifting, gas-lighting, projecting, lying, smearing, victimizing and DARVO. I see her love-bombing the new man while I seek therapy for my trauma bonds and \u201cissues.\u201d\n\nI asked her to attend marriage counseling but apparently there\u2019s nothing wrong with her. Everything is my fault and I\u2019m the one with issues. I\u2019m the one that needs counseling. In our years together she never apologized for anything. She has said thank you once that I can remember. Nothing is ever her fault. She has been the victim at every job she\u2019s had, mostly because \u201cpeople are jealous of her.\u201d Apparently how smart or pretty she is threatens others. \n\n***\u201cSo your world it has been shaken, Your heart it has been breaking, Ask what more can I do,***  ***But the answer's deep inside you, So look and you shall find, Leave the past behind, Have a little faith, everything will be just fine.\u201d*** \n\nI have survived the sheer brutality of war torn countries and battlefields to be subjected to lies, infidelity, betrayal and emasculation. This is the most difficult thing I\u2019ve ever experienced. I\u2019m broken. I\u2019m alone. I am terrified. But I am grateful. I am grateful for the discard. I am grateful to see who she truly is.

We ran a few projects together and were having a great time with it, so I decided to get everyone together to realize a project I had been planning for like 5 years. While we were posting teasers around in various communities that we knew were interested in that kind of thing, I met a guy. We'll call him... Stellar.\n\nMy good friends, we'll call them A and T, talked to him first, and they thought he seemed really cool. He was really interested in what we were doing, and said he had web design experience and would really love to help us out, for free even.\n\nWe all got to talking, and it came out that the reason he was so eager to lend us his skills was because he was going through cancer treatment and people had been really good to him and he wanted to pay that kindness forward to others. Now, me and T have both lost family to cancer so we were immediately super sympathetic to Stellar. He seemed like a genuinely nice dude, we had lots of interests in common, and he was an *astoundingly* good musician, which is something me and T both really admire.\n\nSo our friend groups start talking and we're all getting on really well, and everything is great. Then me and my team finally get our big project ready to launch. We had a trailer and tons of puzzles and websites and images, and I had spent weeks stressing over getting everything perfect for the launch. Everyone involved with it, loved it. Stellar especially.\n\nHe knew that most of the design and content was stuff I had planned, and he wouldn't stop singing my praises. I was \"a genius\" and \"a true artist\" and he was \"our biggest fan\". And for a while, he really was. No one was as active and involved as him. He was always in my DMs gushing about how much he loved it and theorizing. He made fanart and everything.\n\nAfter a few days of this, we started having deeper conversations about art and life and dreams and goals, and I thought he was just the coolest cat on two legs. It seemed great. He said he loved my mind, and that I had a beautiful soul, and, y'know, just really laid it on thick. I was pretty thoroughly wooed.\n\nBut... There were a lot of red flags early on that I ignored because he just seemed so nice and smart and cool. See, I'm like 98% asexual, and he was very much... Not. And I'm kind of used to almost everyone else in the world being much more sexual than me so I didn't really think much of the multiple unwanted dick pics I got very early on in our relationship. He was always trying to get me to cyber with him, and I just really wasn't into it. I went along with it a couple times because I wanted to make him happy, but it mostly just made me real uncomfortable.\n\nThen there was the constant emotional labor. He almost never *didn't* have some kind of emergency going on. He was incredibly paranoid about this \"dark stalker\" he had that was trying to \"ruin his life\", and he had all of us convinced this was true, but after everything I went through with this dude I honestly have a hard time believing a word he ever said to me.\n\nBut on top of deleting his entire online community on multiple occasions to throw off his \"stalker\" and then having a meltdown about having destroyed everything he'd worked to build, he was also going through chemo, which had him sick to the point of not being able to eat and occasionally passing out on the floor. I would beg this man to eat crackers so he wouldn't starve. Beg him to go to bed before he passed out on his desk again. I was literally worried sick about him. I was afraid to be offline in case he needed me.\n\nMeanwhile, I was under a lot of stress trying to keep my game running when several of my teammates flaked on me and I was suddenly doing like 5 people's worth of work. And while I was already barely holding my shit together, Stellar started to get a little overly-attached to the game.\n\nIf things started to go in a direction that didn't match *his* vision, he would threaten to quit playing. And since his infatuation with my creation was the basis of our relationship, it felt more like he was threatening to leave *me*. So more often than not, I caved and changed things to make him happy. Then a few days later he'd be mad about something else. He actually accused T and I of conspiring to make him look like a fool because the story we were telling didn't fit every nuance of his theories about it.\n\nHe'd yell at me about how things were going in-game, and then gaslight me about it. \"I'm not yelling, we're just having a discussion. Why are you so upset? It's just a game.\"\n\nOn top of *that*, he haf also developed a crush on one of the other players, and started dating her, too. Which, you know, that's fine. She's really nice. I'm poly, so idfc if my partners date other people. But it got to the point where 99% of my conversations with him were either him gushing about his girlfriend or yelling at me about my game. I even told him on several occasions that sometimes I just wanted to talk to him about music or video games or what was going on in our lives without having to hear about his girlfriend. I just wanted a little bit of time for just him and me. And he kept saying he would make time for us, and he never did.\n\nThe bigger red flags came when he told me about trying to doxx his girlfriend to find out more about her. And how he told me to never google him or look him up on facebook. Or how he was open about his relationship with her but not about dating me because he wasn't out as bi. (After a while I did manage to get him to come out as bi and he seemed really happy about it. We also had a lot of discussions about how he thought he was bigender, and for a while he really embraced that and I was very happy for him.)\n\nHe also had some real weird obsessions with the show Supernatural, and often pretended to *be* Dean and/or John Winchester.\n\nThere's honestly a lot of other stuff that I'm just to tired and stressed to type out now. Just a whole complex web of lies and manipulation that really fucked me over in a myriad of ways for several months. He also moved across the country and mooched off of our mutual friend P for several months and nearly got P evicted and bankrupt. The name he told us doesn't exist, he doesn't carry ID irl and refuses to get a job, he is on ALL the drugs, and we don't even know if we believe he actually had cancer at this point or if he was just on a drug binge or something.\n\nBut anyway, the reason I wrote all this out is because I saw a post about John Winchester on my fb feed and had a panic attack because I have one every time something reminds me of him even months after he left me to go drain someone else's love and money.", "subreddit": "abuse"}

What should I do about it?", "author": "ZaphodThrowaway", "self_text": "I have known this couple well for the past four years. The husband has been my husband's best friend since elementary school.\n\nMy relationship with the husband: we have always had a bit of a flirty \"banter\" dynamic around other people. Old friends who don't see me as often anymore have picked up on it a few times. I think this is mostly his personality, but I know he thinks very highly of me: he often compliments me to my face, and when I'm not around he tells my husband how lucky he is. I enjoy flirting with him because I trust that he would never make a move, and because we have similar personalities. I was brought up to believe that flirting is sinful, and I can't understand strangers' intentions because I'm on the spectrum, so I'm glad I get to enjoy this dynamic in a \"safe\" way. I have experienced attraction toward him that comes and goes, sometimes (like now) it becomes a bit of a fixation, which is another autism thing I've experienced with a lot of people and have learned to not take too seriously. My own husband is not a flirty person, but he's actually more comfortable with our flirtatious dynamic than I am. We're part of a group chat along with this couple and a few other friends. In the group chat we mainly share Gifs or what we did that day, and make plans to hang out. This guy doesn't typically send Gifs. All of my private messages with the friend are very practical and related to upcoming plans, with a couple jokes thrown in. We have interacted one-on-one plenty of times during short car rides or grocery runs, but he has never attempted to get me alone before or have an ongoing conversation.\n\nMy relationship with the wife: I considered her a close friend for the first two years, but after I introduced her to my other girl friends, she started acting insecure, bragging about her marriage, and offering unsolicited relationshipadvice at a time when the rest of us were waiting for proposals. When I got angry with her over this, she misrepresented our argument in a private conversation with my then-boyfriend, making me seem unreasonable. But then after our engagement a few months later, she was all smiles and always trying to find ways to be included in wedding planning, even though I made it clear I wouldn't be asking her to be a bridesmaid. Things came to a head and I was brutally honest with her right before my bachelorette party...she bailed on my party, but tagged along for the end of my husband's bachelor party. She has done other narcissist red flags like interrupting, putting down my friends, calling me cutesy pet names (even after I asked her to stop). I have done various things since then like grey rock and setting boundaries. We don't spend alone time or go shopping anymore. I'm comfortable with the level of contact we now have, but we're going on a camping trip soon with our husbands and a couple friends, so I'm a little nervous.\n\nThe incident: I received a private message from the husband. He was asking about a video game I'd never heard of: one of those cellphone games that doesn't sound like anything I know he plays. He said something in the game made him think of me, although the specific thing actually has more to do with my husband and was slightly racist. I made a couple references to an inside joke we shared with my husband last time he visited (his wife was away). I was expecting a snappy retort, but all of his replies took a while, and nothing clearly indicated that he understood the inside joke. And then he sent a Gif of a kitten. It made sense with the words I was using, but had nothing to do with the inside joke. So I gave it a \"thumbs up\" to end that interaction.\n\nAs I said before, this guy rarely sends Gifs in the group chat, and when he does they're comical in a gross or surreal way. Who LOVES sending Gifs of cute animals? His wife.\n\nI felt weird about the conversation, so I showed it to my husband. He said he has no problem with us exchanging private jokes, and that I have no reason to be worried or feel bad. At that point I didn't mention my catfishing suspicions, because it sounds so nuts. Journaling just made the whole thing feel even more insane.\n\nThe fact that my husband didn't pick up on anything odd makes me think that the husband still might have sent the messages himself. If so, I just hope his intentions are innocuous. I'm worried about finding out that he isn't as honorable and loyal to my husband as we think he is, and how the heck I would navigate that situation. Or, what if I make a situation sound dirty when that was never his intention? That would make our friendship uncomfortable.\n\nAnd if his wife sent the messages, that's a serious breach of trust that he needs to know about, isn't it? How do I let him know in a calm way that doesn't put pressure on him, so he can decide what to do about this situation in a rational way?\n\nUgh, I feel so violated when I consider the possibilities...but there's still a chance it was just an innocent exchange. Definitely out of character for him though. Catfishing makes the most sense to me right now-does it sound like a real possibility, or am I just assuming the worst because of my past experiences with the wife?

This is the story of that meeting. I haven\u2019t seen him since, and good riddance! \n\nI was in really bad mental health (which I now know was PTSD from being abused by him for years) and had been doing a partial hospitalization program. I was in an incredibly vulnerable state, and was actually dating someone new but had this horrible feeling that the only way for me to feel \u201calive\u201d again was to get back with my nex. So I invited him to coffee one evening. I had spent the last month tearing myself apart with \u201cwhat ifs.\u201d But seeing him and being around him after NC for a year... I found him repulsive, physically and personality-wise. \n\nI feel like during this meeting I was given the chance to react appropriately to some of the same red flags I got from him (but ignored) back in 2006 when we got together. In 2016 when we met up for coffee, he was working full time... and hardly had the money to pay for coffee! I wasn\u2019t working at the time because I was focusing on my mental health, and even I had more money than he did! The meeting was originally going to be dinner, not coffee, but we had to downgrade it because he was \u201cbroke.\u201d \n\nWe talked for a while and I told him about how my mental state had deteriorated over the past year and how I had lost a bunch of weight because I was depressed. He basically refused to acknowledge these things. I am absolutely sure that he thought I was faking about my mental condition, even with the inpatient and outpatient hospitalizations and all of the meds I was as on. \n\nHe lived in a different, nearby city and had driven out to meet me for the coffee. He complained that the time and place *he agreed* to meet me was really inconvenient for him (even though he agreed to it!), implying that I wasn\u2019t worth his time even though he had begged to see me again. He told me about his new job and about all of these petty sounding arguments he had started with people, how it took him a while to get everyone to see things His Way. After we got our coffees we took a walk around downtown and he \u201cjoked\u201d that if he wasn\u2019t on his best behavior \u201cfor me\u201d, he would have thrown his coffee at a car that came \u201ctoo close\u201d to us. Sigh, nothing had changed! \n\nHe asked me, derisively, \u201chow\u2019s your mother?\u201d because she was now in his devalued category (formerly idealized). He blamed her for making me leave him (nope, actually it was my choice... and it\u2019s like he forgot the earlier time when I finally kicked him out of the house only to have my own mother take him in to her home and push us back together!). \n\nHe knew I was in a dark place. When I told him I had been experimenting with microdosing for my depression, he suddenly became very animated and told me about all of the drugs he had been doing since I left him, and basically offered to get me some coke! (Ugh, no thanks, I was a weed girl if anything... I really think he wanted to get me hooked on something so that I would have to cling to him again!). Just like usual, talking about drugs was one of the few things that got him excited. And I know for a fact that if I had said I was sober and had quit weed, he would have told me that he was sober and done with weed, too. \n\nAt the end of the meeting he gave me this big speech about how even if I don\u2019t take him back, I would always be \u201clike a sister\u201d to him and that we could try getting back together as \u201cfriends.\u201d Then be repeated back to me, pretty much verbatim, all of the bad stuff I said about him in our email exchanges while we were breaking up, and asked me if I meant those things. I think he expected me to wither and back down from my statements, but I didn\u2019t. And because he was on his Best Behavior, he didn\u2019t argue. But he also made zero promises to work on himself or change. In his narrative of things, I was the one with the problem and my problems were causing HIM pain. He wanted me to see him as a victim of my mom\u2019s cruelty and of my misunderstanding and \u201cpoor treatment\u201d of him. How could I be so cruel to him?? How dare I leave him after 10 years of craziness and abuse at his hands??\n\nHe called a few days later and told me that he was looking for apartments for us in his new city and that he was going to buy us a new bed from his mom. He emphasized the bed part, which was weird, because we were barely sexually active for the last couple years we were married. But it reminds me of an earlier time (2014) when I broke up with him for about 5 months before going back \u2014 I was like a person in a trance going back to a drug. Our first night back together he wanted to have some kind of romantic reunion sex and I was like... not very interested. He had taken accountability for nothing and I was crawling back because I didn\u2019t know what else to do with my life. I had already stopped viewing him in a sexual way a long, long time ago, due to all of the sexual abuse. I felt coerced into the \u201cmakeup sex\u201d and hated every second of it.  \n\nWhen he said the word \u201cbed\u201d on the phone this time it caused me so much revulsion that I knew I could never go back to him. I told him that it wasn\u2019t going to happen again between us, and he accused me of leading him on. But luckily he disappeared from my life after that.\n\nEdit to add: A year before this meeting he took me off his health insurance without telling me before we started with the divorce, and threatened me against seeking alimony even though he worked and I didn\u2019t. I lost my therapist and psychiatrist with the health insurance and then ended up in the hospital suffering a psychotic break. This is after years of having to bail him out financially when we were both working because he was constantly spending money on bullshit to make himself feel better. It\u2019s after enduring drunken/high rape and endless emotional abuse. The trauma bond between us was so strong that I tried to leave 3 times, sometimes going months NC, before it finally stuck in 2016.", "subreddit": "NarcissisticAbuse"}

I dealt with it really well. I only went cause I wanted my stuff back and he was giving me excuses for months why he couldn\u2019t send it. I knew he just wanted to see me in person. So I went and was polite, didn\u2019t give anything away, didn\u2019t go into detail about why we broke up, I just said it wasn\u2019t working and that we both had issues as people we had to work on. I mostly talked non stop about my cats. It took me 5 or 6 tries to leave him. When I did, I had to do it with a letter over email while he was away on business cuz I knew any other way he would talk me out of it. He doesn\u2019t live near me and he was in town on business last nite which is why I saw him for dinner. I walked to his hotel after to get my stuff. And I STAYED IN THE LOBBY and waited while he got it. There was a time in my life when I would not have been that smart. Because of my shitty childhood I\u2019m kind of a magnet for abusive personalities and I make poor decisions like that. But I didn\u2019t this time. I just remembered the last few times we were together and he really scared me. He never hit me but he got so angry a couple times and I saw this pure rage and hatred in his eyes and I knew he could. It\u2019s hard to explain if you haven\u2019t seen it before. I\u2019ve seen it in the eyes of maybe 3 people in my life. It\u2019s just pure evil intent and malice.

Did I ever do anything to truly not show that I didn't love you with all of my heart, with all of my being? I tried to give you everything you wanted and asked for, I tried to change to meet all your demands.  Was it honestly that I wasn't worth the forgiveness, that the only way you felt you could love me is if I became something, someone else? I built my life around giving you everything I could.  I'm a good man, and an even better partner.  Did I not talk you up enough, was I not positive enough?  Was I really so worthless in your eyes that it went so far?  \n\nI wanted our life to be so good.  I told you that you were beautiful and intelligent everyday and how successful you had the potential to be.  I never stopped you from living, I never asked you to give up anything or anyone.  I was even understanding with Harrington.  I was even understanding with Josh.  I never expected you to change for me.... I tried to build you up about the things you loved, set us goals that we could do together.  I never spied on you, I never kept you from leaving or doing anything you wanted.  I loved you with no conditions.  And I'm having such a hard time determining if I was valued by you, or if I was of no value to anyone.  I'm so sorry for being so angry after you left, and I'm trying not to be angry.  But the more I go over it in my head, the more I feel like I deserved and earned it.  That I'm some vile person who didn't do you right, and I do feel incapable, I do feel like I wasn't good enough.  I don't know where to begin, or why I was so scared of you.  That time you screamed at me over a private conversation with Arthur.  That time you called me a slut and a whore in front of all those people.  That time you berated me in front of Tara, and those other times in front of others when playing music on the couch.  Those times you said you never said anything when I couldn't give you dates and times- gaslighting.\n\nThe times you told me I was incapable, that I couldn't stick to anything.  The times you called my hobbies \"just more shit to listen too\".  The reminders everyday of how I could do no one right.  That rebuilding the house was nice but \"only physical\".  I felt materialistic for accomplishing something that was a home we were both so proud of to be together in.  It was something I felt so good about.  I did what you asked and got rid of John, eventually, but I didn't do that right either.  And I felt such intense remorse and regret.  All those times you lied to me, and I can still forgive you because I totally understand I did deserve this.  I don't know if it was abuse or not anymore, and all the things you wanted me to believe about myself are true now.  I tried so desperately for you not to be angry, I gave up on my life so you had nothing to worry about, and you said that I was losing respect for that, and when I lived my life you were angry and would go to extremes.  You never said I couldn't hang out with my friends, but you never gave me the freedom to do so either.  But holy fuck do/did I love you. I went so far and beyond to ensure your happiness, I did forget myself, I stopped taking care of myself.  I wanted you to be healthy, to be good to feel good about your life.  And in the process I lost everything, good people.  And I got rid of more because I do understand how far you were willing to go and that the signs were there well before anything major happened.  I do honestly believe right now that I am a bad person, and that I deserved this level of guilt and shame.  You didn't want me to respect myself, and when I started pushing for some independence you said I was pushing you away.  I know that you would do anything to get the life you want.  But I never intended, desired, nor thought about hurting you in any way.  I never cheated on you, I never would have.  I honestly believed you were the love of my life.  But I wasn't allowed to question you, or talk\n\nIf I did you would become angry, you resented yourself for what you did but you couldn't stop.  And when it came down to it you had it made, any change to what you wanted interfered with that control you had, that I gave into because everyday I was so guilty.  The ways you said my feelings always made you feel, and that started very early in our relationship.  Meeting you in the middle meant giving up.  And I don't think you originally intended that, but it was manipulative it destroyed me to hurt you in any way.  You knew I thought the world of you.  You knew I wanted the best for you and us and I fought for that.  I fought to do everything in my power to do what you wanted whenever you asked.  By the time you asked me to go to the bar, the one I liked, I felt it was like a trap.  What if John had been there, would you have reveled in the angry torment I would have received in the public eye.  Consoled me when I left crying, making me more indentured to your desires because that was enough to feel like the good person you always said you were?  \n\nI'm truly broken by all this. And I'm very confused.  I don't know if I'm strong enough anymore, when you said I needed to learn from being alone, I didn't think you meant literally and would take my friends too.  No one will believe what I say happened behind closed doors, I'll probably never get to speak with you again, I'll probably never see Sarah again.  I feel betrayed by that.  She didn't have my back and see that something was wrong, I did feel trapped, I couldn't go to her anymore, she was your friend, not mine at that point.  And I had no one to talk or turn too because I was being watched so intently, counting miles on the car.  And I know that you'll never want to see me again, you feel angry when I finally spoke up, when I finally got the guts to send that email to you and recognize ized how far it had gone.  How you really didn't show me much positivity, and I begged you not to be angry, told you there was Nothing to worry about. And you had nothing, you wouldn't have become the next John, you were supposed to be the rest of my life and my God did I want that with you.  But I will call it like it is.  You did abuse me.  And I'm so scared that I would let you back in in a heartbeat.  I'm not crazy, I'm not an angry person, I'm not mean all the time, and I truly cared for you.  But I feel like nothing.  And I'm taking the steps I need to, going to therapy, no longer feeling shame for your decisions.  And it is going to take a long long time to move past you, to learn that I am worth something.  And I will be ok, I will be stronger, but I will never forget even when I forgive.  You can't blame me anymore.  No matter how bad you believe me to truly be.  It wasn't my fault.  It was my independence that scared you.  You will learn to trust yourself one day.  You do have the potential to be an amazing man, it sucks it won't be with me.  And I'm more heartbroken than I have probably ever been in my life.  I'm not ashamed for calling you out.  I wanted to be heard as much as you did.  The only problem is, I was the one being called crazy, untrustworthy, and a liar.  That was something you made sure of, you made sure to tell me I was incapable of change even though that's all I ever did for you.  I will always love you.  But I have a therapist now.  \n\nDo you remember in Chicago when you had me crying and I was hiding from you?\nAll those times you berated me until I was in tears and you showed no remorse, you even belittled as I lie in the bed?\nHow you told me I cried wrong and you wouldn't listen? \nHow you spoke down about my hobbies?\nHow you made be feel bad for wanting to even try?\nHow many times did you use my personal conversations as weapons against me, did I call my friends cause you were drunk again and being cruel and I slowly believed all your lies until I was just a shell of a person?\nHow could you justify breaking me down into this person? \nActing like you're some empathetic keeper of truth?\nBut it's all a facade isn't it?  That's why you cancel on friends, you don't have that empathy enough to stand anyone who doesn't serve you at the time.\n\nHonestly, as much as I love you I'm glad I'm free.  I'm glad there was someway to get out of that emotional hell you put me through with no remorse.  Not even a hint.  Your manipulation was so slow, it was perfect.  You took my strength from me and you walk off a martyr while I'm left holding your pile of shit.  Your wrongdoings and baggage became mine.  I never thought anything like that would happen to me, I thought I was better than that, but I was wrong.  Anything you could say to hurt me you did, and then it was that reflection on our final phone call that really nailed you to the cross.  I hope your next victim fares better than me, because you'll do it again.  Guaranteed you'll do it again. You even got Sarah on board and manipulated her so I had nowhere to turn, you made sure of that.\n\nThe way you used to tell me things like if you had done what I said, if you had obeyed me.  Alex, I did literally everything in my power, I did lie I've owned up to that, I've started therapy.  I worked hard to communicate my feelings with you for forgiveness, I gave up on my life like you wanted, like you demanded, like you asked.  \n\nYet even before the situation with John, you had already villified me, you already had me submitting and subservient, and I was happy to naturally take on a domestic role.  You were watching me and in my accounts before anything ever even happened.  You had moments of clarity, but I don't believe you experienced true empathy.  \n\nI literally carried around the emotional pain for both of us, I was exhausted, depressed, empty, and your tirades on how wrong i was we're narcissistic, abusive and I loved you so much I took it, and it was every single time I questioned you about anything, you flipped everything into me from day 1 you made me feel like I was the holder of your well being, and I thought wow this is a perfect man.  I was honest about my anxiety, my PTSD, my personal shame with you and you called me Asperger's.  I may not process the same way many people do but I do feel intense remorse, pain, shame, and guilt, and I understand how you felt.  But I also know this would have happened anyway, and I still feel like I deserve it, I still feel like I should be making everything up to you when I know that is not the case.  I know what it was, it was abuse.  And I'm scared of you, but I fucking love you still.  The horrifying thing is, I still wouldn't be able to tell you no.  \n\nI'm not desperate for you, I'm not happy without you.  But the gaslighting was there from the get go.  The alcohol that angered you, all the signs that eventually it would become a seriously abusive situation with or without John were present.  Withor without my lie.  I began to dread everyday of more psychological warfare.  I began to isolate myself knowing that was what you actually wanted, cause when I did want to go out you would rage.  \n\nI never ever would have cheated on you, nor would I have intentionally caused you pain and suffering in any way.  But look at what I've been reduced too.  A quivering mess left to hold all this guilt while you walk away Scott free.  You get to pretend you did no wrong when you felt it was right.  You are charming, your are beautiful, but you are a liar and a very very intelligent manipulator.  \n\nYou held me to standards you didn't have to live up to because as long as I felt that way you were doing good, you rationalized and justified.  Even before the whole video fiasco,  when all I wanted was some compassion and encouragement you made sure I felt incapable, unworthy, and unlovable.  What you have do e has truly changed me, some for the good, some for the worse.  \n\nAnd I wanted to marry you, but you didn't want our lives to move forward, you wanted total control and you had it.  PS, John knew I didn't know he had the video, seems he was better than both of us.  And he did just as good as you.  He waited patiently to show me who you really are, and guess what I called him for forgiveness and he got that last laugh didn't he.  Several people actually attempted to tell me who you were in the beginning but I refused to listen because I had you on a pedestal I wanted no other man.  You forced me to suffer through something that you forced me to lie about.  But it would have happened anyway, let's be honest... You never took fault or blame for anything and you justified your own lies as truthq while I was forced to be the perfect image of what you wanted. I was not allowed to think, or feel for myself and you used that as another weapon as another criticism that was my fault for a communication breakdown. But you were never satisfied.  No matter what.  And I look back now and don't think you ever could be. Now for the next several months I'll be in therapy learning to live.  At least I still have that.  But who you really are will slip put when someone starts questioning you about what really happened, you won't be able to hold back your victimized anger, you won't be able to help but tell them how everything hurt you and you'll slip and you'll get caught and you won't be able to justify abusing anyone anymore.   I'll never ever be another target for this from anyone.  \n\nThis has ruined me.  I feel like abused you.  I feel paranoid you're still watching, relieved your gone, and our bond makes me miss you.  I have started to question if I'm the narcissist, if I'm the codependent abusive control freak.

This time just asking to please just talk about it so I can feel better. I was so ready to cut him out of my life before that night.

I'm writing this because, despite having gotten out of a bad relationship, I still feel a lot of effects from it. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLong story short, I was with a dude for nearly 4 years. He had a sweet and kind side, but also had a lot of mental/personality issues that made our relationship chaotic. (Full disclosure, I've since realized I didn't help the situations by being super codependent at the time.) When his switch would flip, he'd go from kind, sensitive, and happy to vicious, bitter, and cruel. Sometimes it would be as small as me suggesting a different hike to take, or me asking a question in a video game. There was a lot of pain in that relationship, and as I suspected he had borderline, I spent a lot of time on that subreddit trying to figure out how to make things work/not piss him off anymore. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI still struggle to wrap my head around *why* he'd be so cruel, but what stuck with me was the gradual assertions over time that I was \"the crazy one.\" He convinced me that my severe anxiety was the root of our issues, and not a result of them. And then used that premise to dismiss all of my concerns with \"that's just your anxiety talking, you don't really want XYZ.\" By the very end, I *was* very emotional, would break down crying in the first 10 minutes of a fight, and would get berated for being sensitive, crazy, emotional, dramatic. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAfter I left, we tried to stay friends, and when he learned I was dating again, he told me he wouldn't \"stand idly by while you destroy other men.\" Suffice to say, that's hurt deeply and fucked with my head a lot in following relationships. The next dude I dated, seemed very sweet and loving for the first few months, but would get very defensive and cruel when I'd bring up issues. (I've asked myself countless times if I was being unreasonable in my concerns, and have asked friends objectively if I was in the wrong.) Telling this second man that his reckless driving and spending was really concerning for me, he got upset and said \"I've talked to my family about you, and they all think you're fucking crazy and I should have left you weeks ago.\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThat line's stuck with me, even after this second relationship ended. I'm now dating a guy, but it's a very superficial, cursory relationship with little emotional depth. I honestly don't know if I'll ever feel safe to really open my heart up and connect with another guy again on a romantic level. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nToday, I had to text an ex because I'm getting his sister's junk mail at my address, and it's a painful reminder he and I dated. I was upset, but made sure in the texts to be calm and rational. \"Why is she using my address/why is this showing up here? It's tiresome to feel like you still live here. Are you sure all your addresses are updated?\" (exact string of texts I sent). \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHe got super defensive and said he was \"tired of you bashing me for things that aren't my fault, who gives a fuck, it's spam, stop taking your anger out on me.\" (again, exact lines from his text.)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI've shown the conversation to 2 trusted friends and asked them to tell me if I was being the asshole, as I'd rather be objective than shout into an echo chamber. They've both agreed he was super defensive, and that I wasn't bashing him. I'm trying so hard to be rational, objective, and open-minded to the idea I could be wrong in these situations, yet I'm repeatedly called the crazy one. I'm really struggling with this. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**What am I doing to attract these guys? And is there any way to stop believing their narrative of \"she's the crazy one?\"** I'm pretty much just burnt out from hoping I'll be loved/connect with somebody deeply without them acting like this. Any advice would be appreciated.", "subreddit": "abuse"}

I have found support for myself in other situations on Reddit so I thought I would try it for this as well. I honestly don\u2019t know where else to turn at this point. \n\nMy best friend of almost 20 years has three children that are like my own. She has a 16 year old daughter, a 10 year old son, and a 8 year old son. Her ex husband was abusive to her their entire relationship, while he never directly abused the children (that we were aware of), they witnessed what she went through. He had absolute control over his whole family and the kids were conditioned to do whatever necessary to avoid causing conflict with him.\n\nMy friend\u2019s 10 year old son recently told her that his dad had sexually abused him during his last overnight visit. We contacted authorities immediately and they started an investigation. The other two children had to be interviewed and they discovered the 16 year old was also abused, it started at age 7 and stopped at age 14. It has taken weeks for her to be able to tell the investigators what happened and she won\u2019t even speak of it with her mother or myself. She told us that she is 16 years old and has worked too hard to establish the life she has for it to be ripped away by something she dealt with already. She said she will tell the investigators what they need to know to make sure her little brothers are protected and she is only doing it for them but after that she will never talk about it again. She has agreed to go to a counseling session and it has been scheduled. I have not asked her about it and I never will, if she wants to talk about it I am here for her but I will never push her. I am attempting to keep our relationship as normal as possible, the last thing I want to do is make her uncomfortable. I am scared to death I am not doing what\u2019s best for her and her brothers, I want to help them in any way I can but I don\u2019t know how to do that, I don\u2019t want to do or say the wrong thing and hurt their recovery. My friend is understandably devastated and she has been going overboard with making sure the kids are protected from anything that might upset them. I have talked to her about that but I\u2019m afraid she will make them feel like a victim by doing that. I want them to be survivors and to overcome what they have been through. \n\nWe live in a very rural area, everyone knows everyone. The arrest was published in the local newspapers and online this week so now his charges have become public. We already have people asking not only my friend but also her 16 year old daughter about it. It makes me so angry to know people don\u2019t have more respect than that and I\u2019m worried about how this will effect her. People treating her differently was one thing she didn\u2019t want to happen and it is already starting. Her grandmother is defending her dad and blaming her mom for making it up to get full custody. She does not have contact with her so she doesn\u2019t know about that but she will find out eventually, I can\u2019t imagine how much damage that will do to her. They are not my biological children but they are mine nonetheless, I won\u2019t stand by and let anyone jeopardize their mental health. \n\nIf anyone can give me some advice about how to help the kids through this it would be greatly appreciated.", "subreddit": "survivorsofabuse"}

He has strong convictions, is a tolerant person in many ways and as a teacher is so passionate about his students. When I watch him talk to his friends, he\u2019s often very gentle and supportive.\nWith me, though, it\u2019s somewhat different. At the beginning of our relationship when we had emotional discussions I felt hostility rolling off of him and felt judged for my requests. At one point I told him that I missed how affectionate we used to be, sending each other little messages etc, and that I didn\u2019t feel as loved. His response was to go cold and tell me that he gave me affection all the time and what I was asking for was unreasonable. \nWhen I told him communication was important to me, he told me I was beating a dead horse.\nHe would get frequently annoyed with me for little things like asking if he wanted to listen to music (\u201cjust PLAY it if you want to\u201d) etc. When I got upset and tried to explain why it bothered me, he\u2019d argue with me until I was confused about why I was upset in the first place and then tell me that the conversation was a waste of time.\nWhen I told him I wanted him to open up to me about his feelings, he told me I was being greedy and ignorant (he said I didn\u2019t recognize when he was being open). \nWhen we sang together, he criticized my technique and etiquette as a musician (he\u2019s a professional, I\u2019m not).

She works at a place across from my favorite bar so I suggested we meet there for dinner since she's never eaten there.\n\nNow, I love that place. I'm friends with the bartenders. I've spent many, many nights there with my friends. But I also spent a lot of time there with my narc, so the place feels a little tainted.\n\nAnyway, I have dinner and a few drinks with my friend. (She doesn't drink.) I ended up having maybe 4 beers or so before she had to jet and get back to work. By that time I was kind of buzzed, lonely, thinking about memories, etc. I almost texted my narc, because I just felt so fucking lonely sitting there by myself. I looked around the bar and saw tons of people having fun, laughing with their friends, and I just wondered how many of them were dealing with the kind of trauma that I was?\n\nI thought (wrongly, of course) that texting my narc would at least make things temporarily better. Seeing her name on my phone screen would anchor me back to a time when we'd text and I didn't even know what a narcissist was.\n\nFortunately I had the presence of mind to pay the tab and go home before I did that. In fact I changed her name in my phone to \"Don't text what the fuck is wrong with you\" just to hedge my bets in the future.\n\nI was home again, by myself, at 8PM on a Friday night. Totally sucks. The fantasy of her responding to a text and coming over and us watching TV on my couch sounds really great but I know it's just a gateway to going back to the shit she put me through before which for sure I do not want.\n\nAt the end I just feel bad because a) I wanted to reach out, b) so many people are out and having fun with their crew and I'm pining over a woman who abused me, and c) IDK, just the crushing loneliness. \n\nI guess the positives of the night was seeing my friend and having a laugh over changing her contact info in my phone, but I just don't feel any closer to being able to have a normal life.

I thought maybe it's my makeup, the way I look or the way I dress. if something happens maybe it's my fault because I put makeup on today. it's my fault. I felt someone touch my butt.  I looked back towards the direction that I felt was touched (if that makes sense).  the guy that I said wasn't really paying attention to me was there. he wasn't looking at me or even paying attention. I kept looking back to take a better look at my surroundings. I stopped after a few times because I tried to just think to myself, it was probably an accident, it probably wasn't intentional. As i was thinking that I could see someone staring at me in the corner of my eye. It was that guy i thought touched me. he was looking at me, just staring straight at me and I immediately moved around and started crying. I started to cry for the rest of the train ride. Being touched in a crowded train ride has been my worst fear and it happened yesterday. I don't know how Im going to get on the train to uni next week, or get back. I'm scared.

He calmed down and asked me if I was okay. I wasn't. I didn't answer him for a while because I was dissociating and I was planning to slit my wrists to just end all of the pain. We talked it out.

I\u2019ve been with my partner for over a year now, and in a lot of ways he\u2019s the most lively and loving person I\u2019ve ever met. He has strong convictions, is a tolerant person in many ways and as a teacher is so passionate about his students. When I watch him talk to his friends, he\u2019s often very gentle and supportive. With me, though, it\u2019s somewhat different. At the beginning of our relationship when we had emotional discussions I felt hostility rolling off of him and felt judged for my requests. At one point I told him that I missed how affectionate we used to be, sending each other little messages etc, and that I didn\u2019t feel as loved. His response was to argue with me about why I complained instead of telling him what I wanted and, when I said \u201cokay, I want more affection\u201d to tell me that he gave me lots of affection and what I was asking for was unreasonable. When I told him communication was important to me, he told me I was beating a dead horse. He would get frequently annoyed with me for little things like asking if he wanted to listen to music (\u201cjust PLAY it if you want to\u201d) etc. When I got upset and tried to explain why it bothered me, he\u2019d argue with me until I was confused about why I was upset in the first place and then tell me that the conversation was a waste of time. When I told him I wanted him to open up to me about his feelings, he told me I was being greedy and ignorant (he said I didn\u2019t recognize when he was being open). When we sang together, he criticized my technique and etiquette as a musician (he\u2019s a professional, I\u2019m not). When I brought this up he said it wasn\u2019t criticism. Conversations would turn into debates, and his tone would get hostile and disrespectful. I told him this hurt me, and he told me that I have to stop identifying my worth with the worth of my ideas unless they were core beliefs. He tells me all the time that I have to grow a spine and stand up for myself. When I express being upset, pointing out his behavior often turns into a biting critique of mine. We end up in a long winding conversation where I end up feeling confused and terribly guilty, as if I was the problem all along. He\u2019s said things that really hurt, like that he sometimes has doubts about us because of the intelligence gap, and then later says that he didn\u2019t mean it/I misunderstood/he was in a bad mood/it was a bad time. I can\u2019t remember if I prompted the question about intelligence.\n\n I know that many relationships are much worse, and I\u2019ve always had issues with insecurity. In this relationship they\u2019ve escalated big time. And I definitely could express myself better sometimes. But over time I feel more and more threatened and afraid to speak for fear of his judgment. I feel like my opinions are invalid. He never accuses me of being crazy, but I find myself saying things like \u201cI\u2019m not crazy\u201d, to which he replies, \u201cWhy would you go there?\u201d and I feel lost. I\u2019m afraid that I am just selfish and skewed because of childhood issues. But something tells me his behavior is borderline abusive. Talking to other people feels like a relief after being with him.\n\nThis has been interspersed with a great deal of patience, kindness and sweetness on his part. He can be very loving at times and actually initiated couple\u2019s therapy for us. So I feel pretty awful suggesting he might be emotionally abusing me. \n\nWhat does it sound like from the outside? Please be honest.\n\nThank you,", "subreddit": "emotionalabuse"}

I helped him better himself physically and mentally, offered advice on work outs and looking good. I quietly sat in anxiety and tried to erode myself to please him.

Because of this constant spying on everything I do and say he is able to hear each and every way I warn my friends that he will likely try to contact them and to disregard anyone calling and suddenly saying all kinds of terrible things about me. since faking twitter and facebook posts is so common online and with 'call out' or 'cancel' culture I had naively assumed that anything he claimed as evidence would be taken with a large mountain of salt.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHe's making sure he's able to hear everything I say, watch everything I write whether typing or by hand, and keeping that info for himself alone. He doesn't share it with others, he doesn't share what he knows with the friends of mine he contacts - instead he shares warped variations on any vague or incomplete statements I make to immediately recontextualize them to fit his drug narrative.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnd when I decide to post to a subreddit, like now for example, or any time I'm talking about who he really is, he both misleads those he's talking to while using his group as a backup and discourages the person he's talking to from communicating with me, convincing them that everything HE is claiming and everything put through his mediation (read: filter so he can change it all to be drug-related) is the only trustable version. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI can tell by the way people start to distance themselves, how they just don't read anything I say or link to them while claiming they have - it's obvious they never do read it though and instead believe that my stalker making claims and assumptions about the things I send is reason to just ignore what I send.....in other words I feel and am silenced by my stalker on a daily basis. And that has been making me fall apart for months.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe thing that's convinced my friend that my stalker is in the right is, honestly, facepalm levels of ridiculous. I have issues with body hair and need to use annoying and time-consuming methods to get rid of any hair that's causing irritation to sensitiver areas like my face. My stalker has been nonstop claiming that I only do this because I'm on drugs - I don't and I'm not on drugs in any illicit sense. If I say anything about the medications I have to take for my chronic illnesses, which he unsurprisingly claims is me using a euphemism, then he starts up with how me taking my prescribed medications means that I'm lying! And because hammering home that I'm, in his false reality, a horrible liar is a daily activity of his I fully know that there's nothing that I can say or do, that me explaining my traumas and that I'm not an addict will always be sabotaged by my stalker's constant presence \\*to\\* sabotage it, and having my mental state gleefully torn down by a 45 year old man who uses remote access has made me give up on living.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe worst part of it all is my being sad is brushed off as a childish tantrum and I'm treated like a baby that needs to be watched every second of every day. The actual words I'm typing, even the actual subreddit this is going to be posted to are just as buried by his words as everything else about me is. It's heartbreaking to, with friend #5 in a sequence of sabotaged by my stalker friendships, watch as this friend is led down a destructive path while I'm sitting in the same room and unable to voice anything without a group of people who don't even have to be in this same room, who can just use a phone and the amount of experience they've had manipulating people against me over these months, steamrolling each word of mine.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBecause this man is remotely accessing all devices and will continually and repeatedly do so I can't even read up on how to fight back against this stalking and this horrible behavior that's been directed at me. Seeing my friends turned into his right-hand people is so incredibly demoralizing that that alone is enough to make me decide that suicide is the best option. I've been isolated again and again and watching my stalker's lying corrupt friendships and not even being able to speak up privately about the ways he's been shitty to me without him immediately bursting into crocodile tears and screaming that I'm being horrible and accusing him of things he'd never do because he cares, really! He's not just putting on an act that I've seen happen over and over and I've just learned to not think too much on how his acting sad and like he's just trying to save me from myself is eaten up by those listening to him. Even when those people have witnessed firsthand this stalker's horrible behavior toward me and how much he terrifies me, it still inevitably is buried under his lies about how deceptive and terrible I am.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI've had to conclude that, as sad as losing another friend is, keeping myself mentally and emotionally safe from anyone who's this unwilling to listen and trust and believe \\*me\\* and not my stalker's manipulated and interrupted version of events. That this stalker has put me into a mental health crisis for the second month with me staying with this particular friend and that I'm seeing the repetitive nature of it and how incredibly \\*odd\\* it is that he doesn't take any immediate and decisive measures.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAfter everything I've said about how this stalker, who is in his 40s by the way when I'm 29, aggressively antagonizes me and obliterates my self-worth I have a question about those he recruits to help him whether or not those people he recruits are aware of his true intentions: Is it possible to break through on a communication level w/ those who have absorbed my stalker's lies and have had their perspective of me compromised or is it better for everyone if I focus on bringing my stalker to justice and just disengage with everyone else as to not cause them further conflict and stress?", "subreddit": "NarcissisticAbuse"}

I have noticed these things during my therapy and meditation sessions.\n\nI will call malignant narc X and normal narc Y. \n\nDuring my relationship with X I often felt a dysphoria and looking back I could understand why. Malignant narcs are not really capable of feeling any humanly emotion, but still they function in human body and their brain needs some sort of social stimulation to function properly. So in that regard we are chosen by them for some spesific reason, i.e being kind hearted, good looking, intelligent... Those are status monsters, the better you are more the supply they get. Once the love bombing ended, devaluation started so harsh though. She was like trying to destroy me, not metaphorical but in literal sense. There never was a glimpse of empathy, compassion or love, her eyes were not even empty. It was evilly dark, If you would ask me to imagine Lucifer in human form I would imagine her. When the relationship ended I was purely anhedonic, no breakup songs didnt mean anyshit there was no love even in narcissistic. It feels like X turned evil a little part of mine.\n\nOn the other hand relationship with Y felt euphoric from time to time, her eyes unlike X, looked empty from time to time but the core difference is there was still humanity in Ys. She was like sweet little scared child in back of that. Devalauation still happened, intimacy was sort of impossible due to her avoidant nature. When the relationship ended though, it hurted FUCKING a lot. I cried more than rest of my life. Loneliness was crippling, I was feeling like other half of my heart was taken. I was addicted breakup songs. Though I still knew it wasnt possible a healthy relationship with her. I broke no contact a few times but managed to get over majority of trauma bond. I still wonder about what she is doing, does she miss me a few times a day but not obsessive as one year ago. It hurted so fucking much but I think I healed some of my wounds. I wish her best, hope she may realize one day her inner traumas and can heal. I believe she is a good person at core.\n\nAs I am returning to X, I am unable to forgive it. She was a fucking sociopath. Even though my relationship with X was waaaaay earlier than Y, I just cant get events happened with her out of my head. I am not really sure If I am gonna heal through that. Lies, gaslightning, total absence of remorse, getting pleasure from someone's pain, the desire to destroy others... Jesus, I am pretty sure she would be like Trump or even worse kind of bloody dictator if she had any social power. I just dont want to believe this sort of human being can exist, it is horrifying.

I lead the team together with my co-worker who also happens to have known me for most of my life. We are really good friends. Well were.\nI decided to take a short break as I was struggling with the pressure and this person got transferred to take over my role during my holiday and when I returned I would keep some of my key role back and they would report into me on the other things they kept being responsible for. This person came in and played along nicely with me during handover but things got a little crazy and I struggled to handle all the challenges but continued to do my best. \nI had a great relationship with a lot of my team some of them had worked under me for 3 or 4 years already. When I was away I had to hand over some stuff that I hadn\u2019t gotten to and I wrote to this person.

They also told me my co-worker and family friend was having mental breakdowns because of me and the pressure I put on them. I felt broken and so shocked. I had this feeling of dread flow over me. This was last February and to this date I still feel ill and sick about it. My friend a few weeks later wrote me a heartbreaking letter to tell me they needed space. When I returned my friend and this person had become best friends both inside and outside of work too - and I felt unwelcome and like now the whole team were against me. It was such a painful time for me - I had worked so hard to build a healthy company - had made some errors on my way while learning but didn\u2019t realise I was such a bad boss. I felt so bad about myself. I felt lonely. I felt depressed and fell into a depression. I lost my confidence and felt like I never knew what I was doing.

My family has a really calm one b/c it was abused and i told him that. My ex says, \"OH, jane knows everything, my bad\". Then i spilled a LITTLE bit of my drink on his sheets.

But, to start at the beginning...\nWhen I first tried to break up with him in September, my mom was involved, in that I had called and talked to her on the phone, and she supported and helped my decision in leaving him, as she agreed that what I described was an emotionally abusive relationship. I currently live across the country for school, so she couldn\u2019t exactly come over to help. She knew that he and I remained friends at the time, after three weeks of no contact (long story\u2014I didn\u2019t really want to, but that was an agreement that was reached with help of a third party that didn\u2019t really take sides and wouldn\u2019t say that he was abusing me. I personally wanted to not see him again, but after that decision was made I felt bad if I didn\u2019t stick to it. My mistake).\nAfter several months of being just friends, which started out with him being very nice and considerate, and ended with long lectures about how horrible I am and my mom is because of the last breakup once he knew he had me beaten down enough to not just up and leave for that, I eventually agreed to be with him in a dating relationship again. He would have periodic hour-long lectures, for lack of a better word, about the evil of me and my mom, and how I shouldn\u2019t have told her because she couldn\u2019t see what our relationship is actually like and so she couldn\u2019t really understand, that my mom didn\u2019t know the terrible things I had done that provoked him to do those things, that such issues in a relationship are private, and why didn\u2019t I come talk to him first about the fact that I thought he was emotionally abusive and  instead just broke up with him?

Her disappointment in me was her main form of discipline for me after I got past spanking age. The thought of disappointing her is intolerably painful to me), I didn\u2019t dare to tell my mom we were back together. I wanted to, as the relationship rapidly became hell, I wanted to so bad, but I didn\u2019t dare. I was afraid of how mad he would be if I did\u2014while at the time he had not yet escalated to violence against me, he had been violent to my cat, and I knew there was a chance he could escalate. Recently at his insistence I mentioned him as a friend to my mom, and how much he had \u201cimproved\u201d and everything. I wanted to just not mention it and lie and say I did, but he had a hard enough time believing me when I told the truth\u2014I was afraid that if I lied it would be much worse. So I directly lied to my mom about it instead.\nI am so ashamed of myself. My mom and sister are so excited to be coming down for my graduation in a month. But they don\u2019t know I lied to them. I hate myself for this. I want to come clean these weekend over video chat, but I don\u2019t know how. I don\u2019t know how to overcome this terrible anxiety and shame and just do it. Or how to face them when I do. It will disappoint them not only that I went back to him, but that I didn\u2019t tell them as well.\nDoes anyone have any advice or similar experiences they could share?

I had lots of friends of made new ones easily. This all changed when I started school. I became of shell of myself. I was severely bullied both physically and verbally by my school mates, but worst of all was my first teacher for 3 years.\n\nWhen I reported incidents to this teacher, she would always cross-question me very strictly. She asked many questions while looking at me angrily and ask the same ones in different ways. I sometimes couldn't remember all the details and she then made it clear that she didn't believe me. This process made me nervous and I therefore missed details so she said, \"you said a b c at first and now you changed the version, so I think you are making it up\". This happened every time. I started to question my own memory and sanity.\n\nI became a shell of myself. I just wanted to be invisible cos no matter what happened, my side of the story was never believed. When I was asked questions in class, I would speak quietly and cover my mouth in fear of judgement. I just wanted to disappear. But my teacher would strictly tell me to uncover my mouth and speak loudly. I tried and she would say \"louder louder!!!\". It felt like my heart was jumping out of my chest. She was also lying to my mother about how awfully I was behaving in class even if never made any noise. My teacher had said that another teacher also had reported the same. So my mother called this other teacher who then said \"Not at all. She is very well behaved. I have never even heard of this case.\" The lying teacher had been fired at other elementary schools and the parents of my school mates also found that their children was treated awfully by her.\n\nAfter high school, I was in a long distance relationship for several years. So I would live with him for a couple of months each time and go back to my home. We would talk for hours on the phone when I was home. I opened up to him early on. He seemed very supportive and attentive. He said he would help me feel confident. His emotional abuse started slowly. He knew all my triggers and eventually used them against me. He was always telling me that I was too sensitive, that I was making false assumptions about him, he would call me insulting names, yell at me. He would distrust my whereabouts as he claimed men would try to charm me. He said I would never find anyone better than him. When things didn't add up in discussions, he would twist the order of what was said and put all the blame on me. He would always bring up stories of him and his exes to make me jealous. I was overanalyzing everything. It wasn't new as it had been ongoing ever since my first teacher. But it was definitely enforced. He told me he was struggling and would improve. I really wanted to believe that. After all, in between there were many wonderful periods with him. He was also very mad at me for only remembering the bad times. So he said I was a negative and ungrateful girl.\n\nEverybody says that one should trust our own intuition/gut feeling. And then they also say that we should always give people the benefit of a doubt. People would say that when experiencing regular clearly negative situations, I shouldn't have given him so many chances. If a friendship/relationship is full of distrust and just doesn't feel good, then it's time to leave. You shouldn't look back. Just leave. But I've never trusted neither my own judgement or others. I don't know how to know what is intuition or assumption. One doesn't always know the facts. But how do we know that our feeling of the situation is justified? How do we know when/how we can trust it? I didn't know if I was misjudging and as crazy as I was told I was. I still struggle with this.\n\nI don't assume. I mean, I don't decide that this must be them acting badly. I'm in a forever lasting loop of questioning if I have a correct intuition or make wrong assumptions. Sometimes these people will get angry at me for wrongly distrusting them, while I have found out months later that I was indeed correct. However, sometimes I have indeed feared something which turned out to be a wrong assumption. My judgement is just not functioning. And I have no idea where to start to correct it. I was a child when I was constantly being gaslighted by my teacher, so I've never known what it was like to 100% trust my own sanity and memory.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**tl;dr**\n\nI was gaslighted by my teacher from age 6 to 8 years. Bullied physically and verbally from age 6 to 18. After high school, I've been in a long term relationship with a man who also gaslighted me. I'm never sure of my judgement when it comes to trusting people. Can someone please give suggestions on how to distinguish intuition and assumptions after having been gaslighted?", "subreddit": "emotionalabuse"}

( which obviously isn't what I want but it's what I'm used to ) The concept of an healthy, mutually beneficial give and take relationship seems alien to me and honestly... undesirable as I feel like it wouldn't provide me with the emotional depth I'm used to. I know this obviously isn't the right way to be and these feelings aren't normal but is there anybody else out there who feels the same and is comfortable with admitting it? It must sound crazy to admit you like getting treated in that type of way or derive some kind of pleasure from it because what does that say about you? but it's the truth and I don't know how to stop the cycle and actually want to be with healthy, emotionally stable, caring people. That just seems so boring to me if I had to be honest, and even more uncomfortable as I'm unfamiliar with that type of relationship dynamic, it seems more threatening and dangerous than being with a narcissist, at least you know what you are getting with them and where you/they stand?\n\nSo yeah.

{"post_id": "bcvgy7", "created_utc": 1555190779, "title": "I think I got confessions in metaphors", "author": "Ell-O-Elling", "self_text": "As I look back over the last four years of my almost 22 year relationship with my Nex I think I got a lot of confessions just that they were wrapped in metaphors or said in such an abstract way that at the time it didn\u2019t click. Now though, looking back they kind of seem like confessions. (The last almost four years I have been trying to get the truth about another woman but he has lied non stop about every interaction with her). \n\nI remember one night we were sitting outside by the fire having a discussion. I don\u2019t remember his exact metaphor but the premise was that if regret is felt then they should be forgiven (yeah, he didn\u2019t cheat, right?! Feeding me this shit!) I disagreed because to me what\u2019s regret? I can\u2019t measure anyone else\u2019s regret! And regret doesn\u2019t change the actions already committed. I argued regret can have an effect on deciding to forgive or not but it was not the deciding factor. The action itself would be the biggest factor obviously! \n\nThere were numerous metaphors to \u201cprove\u201d to me how his intent should be the deciding factor in whether or not he hurt me or disrespected me.  If his intent wasn\u2019t to hurt or disrespect me then I can\u2019t be hurt or feel disrespected. Yeah it was a mindfuck of epic proportions! \n\nBut then there were other metaphors. Usually under the premise of how people aren\u2019t really responsible for their actions since genes drive us. He got this from a Richard Dawkins book he read. \n\nNow during these last four years in addition to the other woman issues, I\u2019ve been trying to make him understand how his lack of effort in our relationship across the board has left me with insecurities leading me to not be able to trust him.  More metaphors ensue to show me how wrong I am. \n\nNow all along I\u2019ve thought these metaphors were basically his way of not taking responsibility and blame shifting. But the more I think about all the things he said and all the different points he tried to sell me on and they kind of seem like a confession to having the affair I suspect him of. \n\nHe\u2019s always tried to convince me he\u2019s never responsible for anything but always before this woman I feel like he didn\u2019t really do the metaphor thing, he would just deny or tell me I was wrong. Then after this woman he starts using one metaphor after another to prove he\u2019s not responsible for anything, and his intent decides right from wrong. Don\u2019t get me wrong he will still straight up deny and tell me I wrong if we are fighting about it. But now since this woman he sprinkles in all these metaphors perfectly tailored to make his point even when we aren\u2019t fighting about it. Sometimes I think he would purposely steer a convo in a certain direction to be able to use that days metaphor. Though when I show him they don\u2019t always work when applied elsewhere therefore aren\u2019t a worthy example he will go back to screaming denials at me. \n\nSo I guess I\u2019m wondering if anyone else has experienced something similar. I almost have the feeling he wants to admit to it (to hurt me of course, but my heart wants to think it\u2019s because he actually feels bad) but can\u2019t do it so he\u2019s almost doing it in a third person (?) way.  Maybe just trying to set the stage for an admission or feeling me out ahead of time with his excuses. (I made it perfectly clear I wasn\u2019t buying any of it so I\u2019m well aware an actual confession will never be forthcoming especially since I made it clear touching me after cheating was knowingly against my will therefore a violation of me to which he would never ever own!) I\u2019m just over analyzing it all still. I know I\u2019d still like answers but I know that won\u2019t happen, so I sit and rehash it all. I feel like there\u2019s so many \u201ctells\u201d in how he said things, his actions, etc and these metaphors seem like one more guilty tell to me now. Or is this confirmation bias? He always accused me of that. I feel guilty of it. Can anyone unravel the metaphor nonsense for me?", "subreddit": "NarcissisticAbuse"}

He said I wasn't like this when we first started dating and I know that I've gotten worse. He's angry because he said he didn't cause it but I'm trying to think and he's the only thing that has changed in my life. He has the most impact on me. I don't want to diagnose myself but I personally think I might have BPD but he is convinced I have little princess syndrome. I can see it but it kinda of hurts how it seems like he's made up his mind that I have it since I match alot of symptoms.

I go to work and come home to him and if he goes out I kinda just wait out the time till he's home. The last fight he said if I run away now/break up with him I'll be running my whole life. He's also told me id prob be stuck at my parents house for the rest of my life. He didn't like how close I was with my mom, I'm worried hes right that I depend on her too much, I know I do depend on her quite a bit but I feel like it's bad. He dosent keep close with his parents though. Haven't talked to anyone about my relationship for about twos years cause he didn't want me going and twisting his words and making him seem bad.

It seems his go to is grow up whenever I do something wrong , that or I'm being useless.

I don\u2019t even know if I can go to the wedding because he was suppose to be my date and I feel fucking selfish. I feel so damn wrong for not being able to show up today for a friend. I couldn\u2019t even have the respect to tell them I wasn\u2019t coming because I\u2019m so ashamed. I don\u2019t even know wtf to say. The actual wedding hasn\u2019t happened yet and it\u2019s around the corner and thinking about it all day after missing this pre wedding event has triggered me all over again.

He seemed to treat the other girls better. He told me that his friends were more important than me. I keep thinking that I must have done something to influence him into doing what he did.\n\nBut he was a terrible person, through and through. When he left, he asked me why I didn't hate him for everything he did. It makes me wonder what else he did that I didn't know about. I didn't hate him because I cared about him and because hate is such a difficult emotion to carry around. Self-loathing is almost easier. Self-loathing means I just hate myself. Hating someone else means I have to carry around a sense of anger and injustice towards another person, a person that I had feelings for - it makes the world seem scary and unpredictable.\n\nWhen I think about what he said, however, I realize just how much he revealed in that statement. He knew he had treated me very poorly. And he didn't care. He didn't feel bad about it. My feelings were inconsequential, even though he knew that a good person would not do what he did. He had no empathy for me or moral standards for himself. So now I have to go back and systematically dismantle all of the thoughts that he planted in my head about himself (after he accused me of being abusive and planting thoughts in his head). The moments where I was confused or shocked by his actions or words were the moments where he was being himself. Everything else was an act.\n\nHe never cared about me. He wanted me just to know that he could have me, and that was the only thing that mattered to him. Then he began to pick me apart, because he could. I asked him why he was doing all of this towards the end, and he said that he didn't know why and that he was crazy. I see now that he did all of it just because he could. There was no other reason. I am not at fault. His friends were more important to him at that very moment that he said those words to me. But he is fickle with no sense of loyalty. He called his friends crazy all of the time. He gossiped about them to me for reason that I didn't understand. He found it entertaining when there was a lot of drama. He might pretend to be a good friend, but he isn't one at all.

We dated for six years and we lived together for just over a year. I'll make this as short as possible.\n\nTLDR at bottom.\n\nEarly on she cheated on me, she then lied about what happened saying it was just a kiss, then pictures got uploaded showing multiple kissing times. I confronted her about this and she lied, saying she felt bad and that was all, fast forward a couple months and she breaks down saying she gave him a blowjob and she begged me to stay with her and I did. The reason? She was in uni, had a rich family and was the smartest person I had ever met. She was secure it seemed.\n\nAfter all of this I finish school and got a full time job, she got her first job in her mid 20's as her father paid for everything, so she didn't need one. We talk about moving in together near my work but she bails on that and eventually she persuades me to move in with her after some rough events at my job, I leave the job to be with her.\n\nI gain about 25 pounds from stress, she tells me i'm getting fat and that she won't be with a large person. So I go on a diet. Worst part is she then starts to gain a bunch of weight.\n\nI move in and immediately things start to go sour. Her mother and her father had separated and her mother had almost no money, so she offered to rent her home to us and we agree. She talks to my gf and they agree to fix up her home, thing is they then come to me and ask to pay a third of the totals. This includes painting, carpeting and furniture and we would have to paint and install the carpets. This came to about $5,000 for my share. We were only renting this home btw, it was still her moms and she would eventually move back in and kick us out when she was ready. Then my girlfriend asks me to lend her money for a car, so I give her $1,000 to help for a new car. Then the billing comes in for hydro and it was getting higher and higher each month, I ask to see the breakdowns that her mother was receiving  (her mother would get the paperwork and charge it on top of rent.) and it doesn't add up to what her mother was saying it was. My girlfriend went off on me, saying she wouldn't talk about her mother lying even when I had proof and did the calculations in front of her. She ignored me for a while and wouldn't continue the conversation.\n\nSome time goes by and I don't get to see my family that often as they live over an hour away. My brother has a child and my gf talks about how she thinks its crazy that he decided to have a kid at his age, he is in his early 20's. This is my brothers child and I love that kid. She tells me how bad my parents are for being okay with everything my brother did, how they didn't teach me properly, how dirty the house it. Everything.\n\nA couple years go by and my brothers child turns almost 2 and she complains how hyper the child is. I have never met a child around that age that wasen't full of energy. She keeps saying how she needs to be in a day care and acting as if it was her child.\n\nI catch a lucky break with my new job and create a project that had took me half a year to complete. It was my first big accomplishment and as my therapist said this is when my girlfriends competitive side came out. She was happy for me briefly, and then came a chance with a new company that was a bit away from my current one. This was a dream job for me. I tell her and her response was \"oh cool\" but that she didn't like it because we would be apart more. So I didn't take it.\n\nMy brother and his girlfriend split and a family member passes so I was on a bit of a down time. MY girlfriend comes up to me and tells me I had been extremely mean over the last little while, I tell her it has been family issues (which I had informed her of earlier when the events occurred) and she tells me she can see a future without me. My heart broke and never recovered. Deep down I relised she would not help me in my down moments and it felt as if she would just make me lower. I wasen't being more mean, I knew that in my heart. Every day after that I had awful anxiety symptoms, my gut was hurting when she was around me, I couden't eat. I felt as if I was walking on egg shells.\n\nI had the flu at one point, she told me I was being dramatic. Which was crazy.\n\nA close friend of both of mine and my gf passed and it caused me to have a panic attack a few days after the news, my girlfriend told me she was at her emotional limit and coudent help me. So I laid in bed feeling like I was dying.\n\nShe admitted that if it was more serious she doesen't think she could have helped me even then.\n\nI called my family and asked to stay with them a while.\n\nShe was upset with this and I told her I was breaking up. I asked her, would you have lent all that money to me? Would you have stuck with me after the cheating? Would you have left your job for me? Most of the answers I got back were 'no'.\n\nTLDR : I gain stress weight from leaving job to move in with gf, she tells me she won't date a large person and she herself gains a bunch of weight. She cheats on me and lies about what had happened multiple times. She gets me to give her mom a bunch of money to fix up her house even when I didnt agree to it and we were only renting the home. She says im getting mean and threatens to leave me after massive family issue. I have a panic attack a few days after a friend of ours passes and she says she at her limit and cant help me and later admits even if it was a bigger health issue she still probably woudent have. \n\nAm I being abused?\n\nI helped her as much as I could. I feel destroyed.\n\nI don't know what I did to deserve this\n\nWorst part is I still love her.\n\nWhat do I do?\n\nThanks to all who read this.", "subreddit": "emotionalabuse"}

She's found my secret Instagram accounts, my online relationship with a long distance ex boyfriend. I'm still friends with my ex.

I can't get off the wheel and I'm starting to feel crazy.\n\nWhy do I feel so crazy?\n\nIn the beginning, my suspected N friend absolutely \\*love-bombed\\* me. Initiated contact to the point that I was shocked she was so interested in being friends with me. Always asked to hang out. Talked endlessly about how lucky she was to know me and meet me. I felt so lucky and special, and I started doing SO much for her, going out of my way, etc. We developed an extremely close bond (or so I thought). We hung out nearly every day and had amazing times. So many inside jokes. She was such an intimate friend.\n\nFor a while, it was great between us. She'd even tell me I was her \"best friend,\" which did surprise me as it felt so sudden. She has this utterly charming, charismatic ease about her and when I was with her, she was my sun. I felt so happy and elated. But I also noticed warning signs: she had a hair trigger temper. She got defensive quickly and easily when called out. She was often selfish and lacked empathy for others. She seemed to care more about her own feelings than mine and everyone else's.\n\nI thought, okay, she's not perfect, maybe a bit narcissistic. Maybe a full-blown N. I can handle that.\n\nCan't I? I mean, I love her.\n\nThen...she met someone else. Someone she initially talked shit about to me and others (red flag?). Someone she was lukewarm about at first.\n\nSomeone who I know for a fact has a HUGE crush on her and may be in love with her (my friend is definitely not gay, dates only men, and does and has repeatedly denied all of this woman's advances - BUT STILL she seems to keep this person around anyway and often jokes they're \"dating\". Red flag #2?? It's so ODD! And it feels oddly cruel to this woman who clearly is in love with her to dangle that \"maybe someday\" in front of her).\n\nSlowly but surely, my friend stopped calling me. Stopped initiating contact. I had to and still have to go out of my way to spend time with her, and I noticed she made up excuses as to why we couldn't hang out.\n\nNow, suddenly, she and this woman she was once lukewarm about are complete and total BFFs. They hang out nearly 24/7, wear each other's clothes, sleep over at each other's houses almost every night. It's utterly bizarre. And my friend does this KNOWING this girl has a crush on her.\n\nSlowly but surely, this New Friend inched her way into my friend's life, and my friend stopped prioritizing me and started overly prioritizing her.\n\nThe thing is, I still love my friend a lot. I still care. I can't stop caring. I want my friend back so badly and so desperately.\n\nBut I can't help feeling as though I've been replaced and abandoned. She's still \"there,\" but she's found a new \"toy.\" I've been discarded.\n\nSo I've been distancing, trying my best to move on and be with other people, but it's like a constant PUNCH TO MY GUT. A complete and utter blow. Especially when she makes plans with me, then \"forgets.\" Or doesn't show up. Or changes plans on a dime. Or stops inviting me over.\n\nI've tried talking to mutual friends about this, but they insist it's not malicious towards me. Why do I feel like it might be somehow? Like I've been replaced? I feel gaslit and crazy.\n\nBecause now and then, my friend drops a few sprinkles of love-bombs, and I fall for it. She reminds me she loves me, says she wants to spend time with me. Then she vanishes again. I've tried talking to her about this, but she never seems to get it.\n\nI just want off this ride, but I can't stop. I go between thinking I'm overreacting and justifiably hurt and angry. I crave her friendship, that deep bond we had and still kind of have.\n\nBut it's like she's throwing this new person in my face. This new person she knows is in love with her, and she isn't in love with.\n\nAnd none of our mutual friends seem to see an issue with this.\n\nAnd I feel like I'm taking crazy pills.\n\nThank you for listening.", "subreddit": "NarcissisticAbuse"}

I know he can change but he\u2019s gonna wanna have to change.. I love him so much and I\u2019m going to continue to be patient until I can\u2019t anymore. I hope we end up working out, because oh god how I fucking love him. \n\nThis probably in a way is my fault though. Because we did jump immediately into our relationship as soon as his 5 year relationship ended. And he, as much as I regret it, cheated on her with me for a couple weeks before they split. Within weeks we both moved out of our homes and moved into a hotel together. I ruined my relationships for most of my family and I, whether some of them want to admit it or not. And I ruined friendships with some of the closest people to me. Drugs were involved, we started talking because he had me try meth and we talked all night long for a couple nights in a row. We also worked together, so we were together nonstop. For about a month and a half this continued, fighting and trust issues. The drugs and alcohol created many of these fights. I was never and still am not addicted. Neither is he, but he chooses to use it because it makes him a \u201cbetter him\u201d. We have so many great memories and little inside jokes and I know he loves me. But he still continues to talk to, text, and see his ex of 5 years. Whenever I get upset and try to talk to him about it, he gets passive aggressive and mad. Shuts me out. He says she needs someone to talk to because of family issues and he needs to talk to her about things he can\u2019t talk to me about, which is bullshit because, I never judge or get mad. I continuously give him immunity in turn for honesty. Which usually only happens when I have hard proof that he\u2019s cheated or done wrong. The first time, one of my good friends came clean that while they were on meth together she sucked his dick, then a couple hours later the three of us hung out all night, not to my knowledge of what had happened. He denied until I showed him the message he had sent her asking again to not tell me. He made up lies until he just gave up. The second time, was at our new job. We both got hired at the same restaurant, him a cook and me a server. Everything was going good until he drank a little too much. We fought the night before we were supposed to go into work. He stole my car key so I wouldn\u2019t be able to go anywhere, including work. So I got a ride from someone else. At work the next day, I asked for the key back and instead he was extremely belligerent in front of management and other coworkers. That day at work I found out he asked a fellow server, a friend of mine, for nudes over text. She didn\u2019t send them but showed me the messages. When I told him I knew he got even worse. He threw my employee meal all over the ground and screamed at me in the back. We have both since been fired, and have yet to get a new job. We are currently living with his grandma and going back and forth from there and my parents. I feel like in a way the toxicity of us is getting worse and worse but yet I can\u2019t seem to leave.. he is my drug and I am addicted. He is a complete narcissist and yet all I wanna do is try and help him.. every person I know has told me the same thing: leave him, he\u2019s no good, he\u2019s a bum, you fucked your life up. And it sucks losing friends because of someone you love not being able to compromise and be patient with you and your close friends. But yet I need to get along with all this friends. Except his ex of 5 years.. I have a feeling she will never not be a part of our relationship. Everytime we talk and he agrees to block her, within a couple weeks or sometimes days, she comes back magically unblocked. I just can\u2019t understand why he can\u2019t leave her be if he wants to be with me and is \u201cin love\u201d with me. She has showed up across the street from my house and if I hadn\u2019t of walked outside he even admitted he wouldn\u2019t have told me he saw her. She is attached and still loves him clearly.

My ex said her mom went to great lengths to spy on her partners but then would be chatting to men on social media behind her bf back and be that sly that she would turn her internet off so she didn't get caught.

Is it me? Am I the one who is really the narcissist?\nI want to state that your ability to self-assess yourself and ask yourself honestly \u201cAm I a narcissist?\u201d means that you are almost certainly not.\nA narcissist must convince themselves and others that they are omnipotent, not characterised by the same flaws that \u201cnormal\u201d human beings seem to be burdened with. To a narcissist it is everyone else\u2019s fault and it certainly could not be him or her who has a problem.\nBut there are two key ingredients that a person with narcissistic personality disorder cannot have. And when you recognise that you have these ingredients, you will know 100% that you are not a narcissist.\n\u00a0\n\nWhat Constitutes Being a Narcissist?\n\nIt\u2019s important to realize that no matter how confused and anguished you are presently feeling, and no matter how much the narcissist has made out that you are the one with all the problems, the following two questions will allow you to realise if you have narcissism:\nThe first question is \u2013 Do you have a conscience?\nWhat this question means is, are you capable of purposefully lying, deceiving and doing things that you know are malicious, lack integrity and harm other people? Do you have the ability to secure your own agenda regardless of the methods you use to accomplish this and how they might negatively affect others? Are you capable of telling people whatever you think they want to hear, just so you can get what you want out of them?\nPlease know that whilst suffering the enormous amounts of abuse that is regularly experienced in a relationship with a narcissist, it is common to lose your integrity. In this state you go into \u201csurvival mode\u201d and you are willing to do almost anything to get through the day without suffering more abuse.\nIf this happened to you, try and remember the times when you lost your hold on your integrity. Were you disgusted with yourself? Did you feel ashamed?\nThis will help you identify if you have a conscience.\nWhat is actually more likely is that you have been,\u00a0or are still, battling the narcissist constantly with declarations of your integrity, and being incensed and devastated when the narcissist has tried to line up examples of \u201chow bad your integrity is\u201d when trying to offset his or her own conscienceless behaviour.\nThe second question is \u2013 Do you have empathy? This means real and genuine empathy, not simply feigning concern and attention towards others in order to win \u201csupply,\u201d such as approval, acclaim, recognition or favors \u2013 which of course is the narcissist\u2019s domain.\nDo you truly feel other\u2019s pain? Do you seek to help others not from a position of wanting to feed your ego, but because you truly would love to make a difference? This could include a wide range of activities like charity, volunteering or simply helping friends or people in the community in need, or sitting with your child and truly emphatically listening with your focus being on your son or daughter without making it about yourself. Do you go to people\u2019s aid or feel their pain without thinking \u201cWhat payoff or recognition can I get from this?\u201d\nGenuine empathy is having concern for others without having an agenda for yourself.\nIf either of these two human qualities are missing \u2013 having a conscience and being able to be genuinely empathetic \u2013 then the individual is likely to have significant narcissistic tendencies. If both of these resources are null and void, then an individual is likely to be severely narcissistic.\nIt truly is very important once realizing you are not a narcissist to understand how you lost faith and belief in \u201cwho you are,\u201d and how the narcissist projected the blame of \u201cbeing a bad person\u201d onto you.\n\u00a0\n\nEven Though You Have Lost Yourself, You Can Remember Who You Are\n\nYes, you may be tormented now, but remember your essential nature. You will know at a deep inner level if you possess a conscience, and are genuinely empathetic. It can be really hard to \u201cbe\u201d these qualities now, when you feel so poisoned with anger, injustice, and feelings of betrayal and pain.\nEveryone, without exception, has the potential to act narcissistically. There are healthy and unhealthy levels of narcissism.\nUnhealthy narcissism seeks to grab hold of approval, validation, love and self-worth that are lacking internally.\nIf you know about co-dependency you will know that this is exactly what co-dependents do as well.\nAbused co-dependents and narcissists can look identical on the surface. The narcissist is always \u201cempty\u201d and tormented on the inside, so he or she cannot hold up the veneer for long. The cracks appear and the narcissistic behaviour breaks loose.\nThe co-dependent struggles with a sense of self, but does have the resources to provide themselves with self-love, approval and validation within themselves. This is what a narcissist can never have!\nCo-dependents in everyday life do not act in the malicious ways that a narcissist does. However, when a co-dependent is severely affected (often by narcissistic abuse), the fearful and \u201cempty\u201d wounds are ripped open, and he or she will become manic, panicked and try to control his or her environment in order to get some relief from the pain that is ripping him or her apart. The co-dependent in this state can appear disjointed, angry, irrational, unreasonable and incredibly controlling.\nWhen the co-dependent has reached this level of self-disintegration (disconnection from self), it is very easy for the narcissist to scapegoat him or her.\nWhen you are suffering from no sense of self, and poor boundary function,\u00a0it is very easy to fall for and stay attached to people who are highly abusive. These people affect your mind, your emotions, bring out your greatest fears and can cause you to\u00a0almost\u00a0lose who you are.\nWhen you are in narcissistic relationships, it is an understatement to say that you are incredibly traumatized and confused.\nThis does not, however, mean that you are narcissistic.\nNo matter how crazy you may feel right now, no matter how toxic, angry, deranged and distraught you are, keep coming back to the questions regarding having a conscience and being able to be genuinely empathetic, because within those questions lies the answer.\n\u00a0\n\nThe Narcissist\u2019s Projections\n\nIt is vital to understand the following: The narcissist does not love and accept him or herself.\nAny healthy human being on the way to establishing a healthy sense of self does the work to fully unconditionally love and accept themselves completely. This means the \u201cgood\u201d and the \u201cbad\u201d about oneself. This means the recognition that you\u2019re human, you have only ever been doing the best you could with the inner resources you had, and the level of emotional intelligence you possessed at the time.\nFully unconditionally loving and accepting self means being able to take full responsibility without defections and excuses to recognise, embrace and forgive the painful parts of ourself in order to heal them and transform them.\nThe narcissist has completely rejected self-love and self-acceptance, and certainly does not apply them.\nHe or she has numerous disowned painful parts that the narcissist wishes to avoid at any cost. This is why he or she has created a false self, the grandiose version of \u201cself\u201d that is not real and is positioned to defend mercilessly the painful inner parts that the narcissist has no intention of looking at, embracing or transforming.\nThis is why the narcissist has severe issues with being accountable, admitting he or she has behaved poorly, being genuinely remorseful or taking responsibility for unacceptable and pathological behavior.\nThis is why the narcissist projects onto you that you are the bad person, you are the cause of the problems, and\u00a0makes you out to be the scapegoat.\nThis is why the narcissist will, if you bring the term \u201cnarcissist\u201d to his or her attention, declare that you are the one with narcissism.\nThe narcissist\u2019s deep wounded inner parts have been rejected by him or her and are unattended to. They have not been healed. They are unnatural, they are not \u201clove;\u201d they are \u201cfear\u201d and \u201cpain\u201d and they are not aligned with \u201ctrue self\u201d. These unhealed parts are intensely painful, and they erupt for the narcissist constantly.\nThe narcissist has two options to stop this intense emotional agony. He or she seeks a \u201cfeed\u201d of narcissistic supply from outside him or herself to try to prop up his or her false self again \u2013 to try to override the internal agony \u2013 or he or she will have to line up someone else to dump the emotional torment on to.\nIf you are being narcissistically abused, you will receive the pain of both of these forms of abuse. The betrayal of the conscienceless behaviour the narcissist does outside of the relationship in order to receive his or her ego feed, and the blame shifting and condemnation of the narcissist\u2019s disowned parts onto you.\n\u00a0\n\nTaking Responsibility\n\nTraditionally, whenever I have written articles about \u201cwhat\u201d the narcissist does, or how he or she thinks and behaves, this creates posts from my audience going into detail about what their narcissist did and what they endured as a result of this behavior.\nI want to discourage this \u2013 adamantly. We all know what narcissists do, and I promise you from this side of the fence the stories are almost always virtually identical. Narcissists do the same stuff, in the same ways, because they are empty selves who have numerous disowned parts that they refuse to take responsibility for, which can only manifest as behaving in conscienceless ways.\nAll narcissists are the model of \u201cI have been hurt, it\u2019s now all about number one, and I\u2019ll pit myself against the world in order to get my needs met.\u201d Everyone else comes off second best.\nSo please, I don\u2019t want to hear your stories about how bad narcissists are. The reason is because it does not serve you. None of us have gotten well or healed our own unhealed parts by staying focused on what the narcissist did.\nThe reason I wrote this article is to help break you out of the illusion that you are the narcissist. Because eliminating this illusion can lead you forward to your own self healing.\nYour healing now is about\u00a0taking responsibility, and fully claiming and embracing that it was your own unhealed parts that led you into a relationship with a narcissist.\nYou are not a narcissist, because you do possess a conscience and empathy; however, you do need to realize that it was your disowned parts, the parts that you didn\u2019t like about yourself, your own lack of self-love and self-acceptance, that caused you to lack boundary function and look to the outside for love, validation and self-worth, rather than providing yourself with these commodities from within.\nThis is what co-dependency is all about \u2013 seeking to get from the outside what we are failing to grant ourselves. This is what painful relationships are all about \u2013 they show us the unhealed parts of ourselves that we have not as yet taken full responsibility for. They show us that we have not as yet learnt or applied ourselves to totally unconditionally loving and accepting our own wounds in order to transform them.\nI would love it if you stated your claim that you are not the narcissist in the comments below, and use this knowledge to start putting your attention on the task at hand which is embracing yourself unconditionally (good and bad parts), taking full responsibility for yourself, and transforming your unhealed parts that led to painful experiences.\nRemember you, unlike the narcissist, have the power within to fully come home to you. You can do it\"", "subreddit": "NarcissisticAbuse"}

I am scared to admit it to my friends and family. So I rather tell this to strangers on the Internet. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy ex (M33) and I (F26) met in university. At first it was all fun and games. We slept together. After some fun he told me that he wasn't interested in me. He told me so many, many, many times. I was too boy-ish, not sexy enough, just not a good fit for him. Even though he said all those things he still wanted to sleep with me. And at this point I was already head over heels for him. Because you see: when he didn't tell me that I wasn't what he wanted, he told me that he might see a future with me. \n\nThen he met a friend of mine. They became a thing for a few months. She didn't know I had feelings for him and he didn't really care that much. I tried to break things off with him. I told him. He convinced me otherwise. We could still be friends. Right? Wrong. He cheated on her with me. I still feel bad for her. Looking back I just want to slap myself. He told me that his feelings didn't really develop in the direction he hoped. So, she was just a fling for him. And sleeping with me, well you know. \n\nAfter their break-up a few weeks pass. He starts dating another girl. This time from our university. I have to see them everyday. Smiling, being happy. I was so heartbroken. When he came to me and slept with me I thought \"what if he doesn't yet see that he likes me?\". So, he cheated on another girl. With me. They break up. \n\nHe does attempt to date another girl. All while stringing me along. Telling me, that me being me will only lead to me being alone forever. I should change who I am, should loose a few pounds, should change what I wear, should wear make-up. And I tried. I tried so hard to please him because every time he was around me, he made me feel so special. As if being close to him was something special. Because at this point I believed that he being with me and sleeping with me was some once-in-a-lifetime-thing for me.\n\nI developed an anxiety-disorder. I couldn't go outside alone, I couldn't be alone at home. I was in a constant state of fear. What if he gets into another relationship? What if he stops being with me? Who am I without him? I go into in-patient treatment for about two months. He visits me frequently. Behaves like someone who has actual feelings for me. I believed him. \n\nEventually we get together. He moves in with me rather quickly. While I work and finish my studies, he drops out of university. Doesn't want to get a job. Only watches TV an smokes weed. I work my ass off only to get home and get yelled at. Buy groceries, clean the house. He insists that without him, I would be nothing. Nobody would ever really love me. I should be thankful. And I believed him. With every bad thing he tells me, my self-esteem withers away. With every punch against my arm or my walls, my anxiety gets worse. With every broken promise, my trust bleeds out of me. \n\nAfter yelling he would be extremely nice to me. Told me he loves me. I am the one. And I believed me. I though that you just have to work through the bad stuff. Everything wrong in our relationship was due to my failings. If only I could change more about myself he would love me even more. I had finally found my happy ending with him. This is love. This is love. This is love. \n\nAs time goes by I start to develop an anxiety-disorder yet again. When he left me home alone, I got panic attacks. When I had to go somewhere alone, I got panic attacks. What if he cheats on me? What if I come home and he is gone for good? What if I am still not enough? What if I never will be enough? He uses my anxiety against me. Telling me that I am a burden to him. A burden to my family. Then he would apologize. And repeat. Over and over and over and over again. Stealing money from me, lying to me, telling me that I remember things incorrectly. I am insane. Its just my anxiety. I am nothing without him.\n\nThere was so much more, that even thinking about it makes me cry. I can't.\n\nAfter stumbling across an article about emotional abuse I realized what he was doing.  \nIn two weeks his lease is up and he has to move out of my flat (his lease and not mine, because my parents own the flat).\n\nAs much as I am happy that he is leaving and that this chapter can be closed after seven years I am scared of being alone. That all he said was right in the end. I know I'll never see him again. I know my anxiety will heal. My heart will heal. I also know he will go on and do this to yet another person. Because he has done this before.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\ntl;dr: my ex broke me down and he is finally leaving in just mere two weeks. I am happy but also scared.", "subreddit": "emotionalabuse"}
{"post_id": "bd4oiz", "created_utc": 1555260318, "title": "He never accepted me", "author": "drdroid444", "self_text": "Hi everyone, this is my first Reddit post. I've been a lurker for a long time, but I finally gathered up the courage to post now because I am scared of being attacked on the internet. \n\nI am currently separated from someone who I and my therapist has identified as a textbook narcissist. (My spouse have been together 12 years, married for 5 years.) If anything happened or he said anything hurtful, he denies it happened and states that I \"must be crazy\"; nothing that has happened is ever a big deal even if it causes me great pain; he will throw the worst tantrum if you dare to provide him with any criticism, but it's OK for him to dish out criticism to me all day every day; he has been very nasty to me in the past year since I got a promotion at work and now make more than him and I am also days away from defending my doctoral dissertation; etc. \n\nI suffer from depression and PTSD and often have a difficult time with that, and he gets pissed with me when I have episodes because I don't want to leave the house or be social with his friends. \n\nI keep going back and forth in my mind to whether I should stay in the marriage because his family is the only family I have as I am estranged from mine due to them being emotionally abusive. I have no friends because all of the friends we have had sided with him due to him talking a lot of crap about me behind my back. Basically, I'm all alone. I have no one. I have no support system or no confidence that I am doing the right or wrong thing. I'm pretty much scared to do anything.\n\nMy spouse and I attend marriage counseling and I recently confronted him with the fact during the course of our 12-year relationship, I felt that he never accepted me. Last week he confirmed my statement that he never accepted me and he has purposely tried to change me over the course of the past 12 years we've been together because he feels that I need to change.\n\nThis has actually sent me in a tailspin mainly because something I have always believed has been confirmed as being true. I knew all these years I was never good enough, which hurt my self-esteem and sex drive and everything else over the past decade. I asked to talk to him about his not accepting me last week and he doesn't understand why I am so hurt about it. He doesn't think it is a big deal at all, but I think it is. He also said he isn't sure if he will ever be able to accept me. \n\nI just don't know what to think about all of this. I feel like I am going crazy. I keep thinking about leaving for real, but then I think maybe I am actually legit crazy. I am also in hell and I don't think I will ever truly be happy. Again, I am in therapy and have discussed this but I guess I need insight into what other people who have had experiences with narcissists think.", "subreddit": "NarcissisticAbuse"}

Mainly my mom.\n\nAs far as I can remember I used to get screamed at for doing /anything/ wrong or anything she didn't like. I still am. I feel like I have no choice but to keep trying to endure it. My parents divorced when I was ten and I had to move to a town near my mom's hometown with my mom. Now that time is when shit really got bad. I don't blame my dad. If I was him, i'd just run too.\n\nStuff got terrible. I don't fit in at my new school, I got bullied, yada yada, my mom thinks I \"don't try enough to fit in\". I always used to get beaten both at school by my classmates and at home by my mom. Soon enough when I was in 7th grade screaming turned into degrading, terrorizing and overall it's just torture. I flinch just by seeing something move suddenly. I think I got depression (self diagnosed i guess. I wouldn't have the balls to ask for help from anyone i don't know) because of all this. I'm socially anxious and akward. I have little to no irl friends. Social media, internet-friends that I can open up to and video games are my only escape. I oftenly get anger attacks and breakdowns in return to this. \n\nI hate her. I hate seeing her, hearing her voice. I always refuse to go anywhere with her and my cunt of a phlegmatic stepdad that doesn't realize he's literally her bitch. Because of that she one time got so violent, she had begun to puncj me and slam my head against the wall. My eyes literally went dark for a second and at that time I just snapped and fought back, leaving her body bruised and i'm not proud. I just want this to end. I don't know if I was right to do so. She victimizes herself when speaking about me everytime. She keeps threatening me to send me away to my father or a foster home w/e but never does anything in regard to that. I feel like I want to die at this point but have no balls to do it. I tried.\n\nWhy not just ask for her from my dad, you might ask?\nI don't know myself. He barely comes back to this country due to the fact he works in a foreign country, even if I have other family at my old town. On top of that, my mom keeps telling me that no one wants me, that my father and his side of the family doesn't care for me and no one likes me. She'd rather have me dead, she told me that. She's manipulative as fuck. Always pushing me to try and ask some money out of my dad. I never do it, though. I'm just too scared at times. I have a weird habit of rocking back and forth when sitting from time to time. I'm fucked up psychologically. You can just tell by reading this.\n\nI see myself dead in the next five or ten years. I see myself without a future and possibly in a grave. I have no one to comfort me when I need it the most. People around me are jerks. Assholes. Selfish pricks. I hate this world and I hate me too.\n\nSorry for the long post but my heart is aching and I had all this bottled up for a long time.", "subreddit": "abuse"}

Although it should be somewhat easy because as l now learn about narcissism, l see the patterns and our story is not unique at all. \nWhen my roommate at the time introduced me to my husband l wasn\u2019t really attracted to him at all. There was just no chemistry and honestly something off putting about him. According to him when you ask him now, he decided l was his future wife immediately, and so the pursuit began. Flowers, candles on my doorstep, notes on my car, staring at me (and not even breaking his stare when l noticed) anytime we happened to be in a group setting with friends. \nWe weren\u2019t even dating and for Christmas he wrote me a poem about me, then proceeded to go to 7 stores to find solid yellow wrapping paper because that\u2019s my favorite color. I should add my spouse grew up with one of the most horrifically abusive childhoods l have ever heard of. He even went without food and clothes as a kid because his parents were heroine addicts. \nFast forwarding l eventually became drawn to this man who clearly was so \u201cloving\u201d and \u201camazing.\u201d We started dating and 1 year later we married. The first time l remember seeing behavior from him that was so confusing and devastating was our honeymoon. We got in our cruise and instantly he became a different person. He wasn\u2019t outwardly mean or anything, he is only mean and abusive when you accuse him of bad behavior. He was just mostly silent. Here we were celebrating our new life together and at dinner he was mostly silent. It all just felt like the person l dated had been replaced with this totally different man. We fought and fought the entire cruise, it was horrible. When we got home the tumultuous marriage continued with me becoming so desperate to get him to see that l felt invisible much of them time in his presence. Soon after l contracted  a severe case of mononucleosis and was in bed 9 solid months with fevers up to 103 that wouldn\u2019t go away. My Dr was seriously worried...my spleen was swollen, liver counts were way off l was a mess. We lost my income obviously and were forced after 9 months to move in with my parents. It took me another year to get well enough to work part time and eventually we moved out. \nThe cycle remained intact for the next 5 years and the only time he\u2019d show consistent attention towards me was when l would pull away and give up. HE NEVER EVER EVER owned anything! Not one time did he say \u201cyou know what l can see were my behavior was wrong l am sorry.\u201d Not even to this day can he do that. \nOf course stupid me thought l am just too needy (comes from my own abusive toxic parents telling me this my whole life.) Also stupidly l thought a baby would bond us. \nAfter 6yrs of marriage and trying to rebuild my health (it remained an issue to a lesser degree whole time and was labeled \u201cchronic fatigue\u201d) we had our daughter. If l felt ignored before, l hadn\u2019t seen anything yet! I had a c-section and in the fricken hospital he never asked me if l\nwas okay or what l needed. He\u2019d stayed there per my request and would barely wake up with the baby during the night often complaining to me while l laid there nursing my 20 staples across my ripped open belly and recovering from the 42 hour labor l had with her prior to emergency c-section. He was TIRED AND HATED THE BED THEY HAD HIM SLEEP ON!\nYears and years of this abusive cycle continued and add 2 more babies both boys to the mix and you get the picture. I mostly felt ignored and invisible, but l threw myself into motherhood and felt like my whole world was finally a warm one because these 3 amazing human beings were just perfection. My husband struggled with keeping jobs with a pattern of getting laid off about once a year. We made it through. \nFinally when we\u2019d been married 14 yrs he got laid off and stayed jobless for 4yrs. Fortunately l had inherited $500,000 from a trust fund when my grandparents passed. Soon after lay off this time l became so ill with what they thought was Lyme or Fibromyalgia (tests were inconclusive for Lyme) l was bedridden 100%. I could not even get up to eat dinner at table with kids. Whole 4 years he was home l was predominantly bedridden sleeping 18+ hrs a day. He finally got a job and l literally cared for my kids from bed often struggling to even get up and drive them to school or stay awake when they were home and even be able to get up and get my youngest meals or drinks. \nIn the last 2 years he has been back at work l have spent 75% of my time in bed 25% up on Adderall finally given to my by Dr for focus and to give me energy. I should also add Dr diagnosed my husband as Aspergers 5yrs ago which my husband says is why he lacks empathy????\nThese days l feel like a shell of a human being. Have actually for a few years. I used to be social, extroverted, loved life, and going places. I have become agoraphobic, withdrawn, detached, and feel like my life is not real (depersonalization). I make progress get up and some negative crappy fight knocks me back down for days hurting in every part of my body and so tired l can\u2019t get up to shower. \nThe huge details l should of added in are eventually when my health gave out last 5yrs plus l got sick of giving to someone who would step over me if l were bleeding-out dying on the floor l quit  having sex with him. This brought on all the love l had looked for and he would shower me with all l wanted to hear even flowers then I\u2019d give in we\u2019d have sex and instantly he\u2019d ghost me and l was invisible all over. After a few hundred times (yes l am that slow to learn) l shut down physically 100% and wouldn\u2019t let him hug me or touch me in any way. \nDuring this time l found out that while sedated on sleeping medication prescribed for insomnia, my husband was groping me in my sleep since l wasn\u2019t consenting to physical relationship awake. \nWhen l confronted him that this was wrong and in fact illegal he said it was only my breasts, only 5 min, and not a big deal. When l pushed the fact that it was wrong and finally said l am done with this marriage he became a monster yelling how dare l make him out to be rapist or some deviant screaming at me. I said get out of my **** house get the ***** away from my kids. He fell to the ground begging literally sobbing saying please please don\u2019t do this. He proceeded to cry and vomit for 2 hrs begging... l went down stairs left him in his heep on the ground got myself a bowl of ice cream and watched my favorite show. I could care less! \nThat was week ago and now he swings between cycles of small gifts and texts that are nauseatingly over the top with how l am the air he breathes, to him confronting me with verbal attacks on how l am at fault in this marriage too and act perfect. He yells despite my requests to keep his voice down because of the kids, storms out and leaves the house making huge scenes in front of kids. \nI lay here telling my story while my 3 kids once again are downstairs ignored because l am too sick to peel myself off my bed, have a fever, feel like l have flu (l don\u2019t). He is doing the usual and playing video games completely ignoring my kids (he NEVER does anything with them and barely interacts with them)\nWe have been in separate rooms 3 months. I am alone, don\u2019t recognize myself in the mirror, am terrified, am bankrupt (emotionally and literally because with his job instability and my not working we burned through all $500,00 since we are in South Ca and it\u2019s $$$$). \nHELP! If you have been kind enough to stick with me through all this tell the end...what do l do? Is there hope in these situations? Meaning can a Narcissist change with therapy? I don\u2019t want kids in a broken home, but this is not healthy either. How do l single parent when l  so sick and can\u2019t consistently even get up let alone get a job. I should add times he\u2019s been away on trips etc l miraculously function and feel better. My sister is FED UP and has offered to go to my Dad with me asking for financial help until l get on my feet, my Dad is multimillionaire. My kids have this odd protective thing with their Dad where if we fight they defend him. They idealize him and give him way more credit and love due...it\u2019s confusing to me. If we tear this family apart they will be devastated and my oldest in particular now 14yrs WILL BLAME ME for sure. He never spends time with her etc but she puts him on a pedestal. I just don\u2019t know- l am close to a total breakdown. Thanks in advance!", "subreddit": "NarcissisticAbuse"}

Jane and I are both 20 and we've been best friends for close to 9 years, and over the years I've had steadily growing concerns about her family and home situation. I feel like it's not my business to pry, but now that we're both in college, it seems to have gotten worse.  \nJane has struggled with depression and anxiety issues since we were in Freshman year, and although she's mostly healed from them, every now and then, it flares up again, especially during periods of high stress. Her parents knew about it, but basically figured that she could walk it off and didn't really contribute to her mental health and well being at all, (especially since her mom is one of those types who thinks medication for that kind of thing is a government conspiracy.) even during two separate suicide attempts and more than a few scares. Through all that, they just kept pushing her to do better in school and to try and get a job.  \nThrough the years, I've also noticed some worrying behavior from her. Whenever her mental health starts to act up, she always blames herself for it and is obviously desperately afraid of disappointing her parents, (especially her mom) saying things like \"I can't let my mom bury a failure,\" or \"If I let my mom down, I might as well be dead,\" or \"My parents raised me, and now I'm a waste of organs living off of them.\" Whenever I criticize her parents' behavior for not supporting her, she gets mad at me and says that I don't understand, and that if she fails then she won't have anything to live for. Obviously, that's pretty worrying.  \nAs far as the behavior from her parents that worries me, well, there is the fact that they have, on multiple occasions, threatened to disown her and kick her out if she fails classes or drops below a certain GPA, and many, many, MANY, occasions where she has come to me in tears after her parents screamed at her for some trivial offense like sitting on the couch watching TV for too long. And now that she's in college, AND has a job at a fairly decent restaurant, her parents are ALSO placing the absurd expectation on her that she:  \nA. Maintain the job full-time  \nB. Go to university and maintain above a 3.0 GPA  \nC. Finish school within four years while taking 5 classes every semester AND not failing any classes  \nI'm not kidding. For two years, they've been forcing this work standard on her and every step of the way, they've been threatening to kick her out or stop paying the school if she slips on any of it. Because of this, obviously, she's been having stress breakdowns and her mental health has been deteriorating back to where it used to be, and all the way through, she keeps insisting that all her slip-ups are her fault, that she's failing her mom and dad and the rest of her family by not being the perfect golden child they want her to be.  \nIt honestly breaks my heart every time she comes to me with a new story about how her mom screamed at her for flubbing an essay or missing a day of work because she was having such a bad period that it was making her vomit everywhere, and it hurts even more for her to blame herself for it every single time something like that happens and insist that her parents are just pushing her because they love her, and that by failing, she's a waste of space.  \nI don't know how to get through to her about this, and I don't even have any kind of experience with this sort of thing, so I'm not even 100% sure if this counts as parental abuse, even though I'm pretty sure it is. I just wish I could help her somehow.   \nAny advice would be appreciated, especially on how to properly talk to her about this.", "subreddit": "abuse"}

{"post_id": "bdabjy", "created_utc": 1555291997, "title": "Was it abuse or am I overreacting?", "author": "chaoticAtropa", "self_text": "*Long post ahead*\n\nHey folks, this is my first time posting in this sub, so I'm not quite sure how it works. If this isn't the right place for this, feel free to let me know and I'll take it down. Before I start, tw for sex stuff and mentions of alcohol abuse. Alright, let's go.\n\nLast year, when I was 18, I was on tinder. In my bio, I made it clear I was looking for an actual relationship. I know, tinder isn't the usual place for that, but I figured I'd try my luck and see if I found someone cool and, failing a romantic relationship, I might make a friend or two.\n\nAfter a while, I was messaging back and forth with a few people who seemed really neat, including one 20 year old guy I'll call A. Not long after we started messaging, he wanted my phone number. I, being dumb, figured there'd be no harm in it. We ended up video calling all night, talking about our lives and the things we had in common. We decided to meet up for ice cream the next day, which I was nervous but excited about. We hit it off in person too and, after letting a bunch of people know where I was, I agreed to get in his car so we could drive around a bit.\n\nRight off the bat, he kissed me. I was like 'hey, what? This is kinda fast' but, of course, I didn't say anything. I had no frame of reference for how first dates with strangers were supposed to go, as I'd only ever dated people I already knew. So I figured this was normal and just sort of let it happen. Before anything else happened, I made sure he knew I was questioning my gender (I now know I'm a trans man, but at the time I wasn't quite sure). I didn't want to lead him on or trick him or anything, and he said that was okay even though he was straight. Before the day was out, he referred to me as his girlfriend and, overlooking the warning signs, I figured there was no harm in giving it a shot.\n\nAs our relationship progressed, there were all these red flags. I remember after a while I had all these misgivings and I didn't talk about them or act on them because I was worried he'd get upset or angry or something. I didn't tell anyone else either for fear they'd get the wrong idea about him. Not only that, but I kept telling myself things were good and stuff until I believed it. I brushed over and excused all sorts of things, even things that should've been absolute dealbreakers.\n\nFor example, he didn't want me to wear my binder bc apparently I looked better without it, even though it's a major help in keeping my gender dysphoria at bay. Even though it made me extremely uncomfortable, I wore a bra instead for him. This led to an incident where he grabbed my chest outside a friend's house even though I'd asked him not to touch me there. His excuse was 'but you're so cute!' and he laughed it off. Looking back, that is 100% the most bullshit excuse ever.\n\nAnd there was also time he said he liked me better drunk, even knowing I was struggling with drinking too much too frequently at the time. That one really, really messed with me. Not to mention he pressured me into sex after I said I was uncomfortable, saying things like 'for me?' and that it was a necessary part of a relationship and stuff. He'd also tell me things about how horrible his exes were, and how he was glad I'm not like that, and say things about how I'd seen him at his worst and stuck by him, so we were obviously meant to be. Stuff about how great and wonderful I was. And I thought that since he thought that, there's no way he'd purposefully treat me badly right? Right??\n\nWhen he'd do stuff like that I figured 'I guess I've just gotta work on it. After all, relationships involve compromise. If I'm not a good enough partner as is then I've gotta do better'. And sometimes he'd stop doing things like the aforementioned stuff for a short time, and I'd be like 'hey, that changed. I must've done something right, so I should keep it up'. Then, of course, it'd start again and I wouldn't know what to think other than that I had to keep trying.\n\nThe relationship ended when he tried to cheat on me with one of my best friends while I was out of the province. The friend immediately told me and showed me screenshots. Still, I decided to talk to him about it. When I called him out, he admitted it and started guilt tripping me, saying things like 'it hurt me more than it hurt you', and 'the guilt makes me want to kill myself'. I asked if we could talk in person and he stopped responding to my calls and texts. After a lot of back and forth and discussion with friends who cared about me, I broke up with him over text since he wouldn't answer the phone or meet in person.\n\nDespite all this, I feel like a lot of the problem was my responses to his behaviour. Don't get me wrong, his behaviour was definitely bad, but it wouldn't have been nearly as bad if I hadn't gone about things the way I did. I just wish I had some way of knowing if all of this was on purpose or just came from a lack of insight into his actions. Regardless, I hate how he's still about to make me second guess myself after all this time. Thinking about it makes me sick.\n\nUp until today I never really considered it abuse, just a bad relationship. At work, I heard a song I'd listened to a lot as a kid that even then I'd recognized was clearly about an abusive relationship (Perfect by Marianas Trench) and realized 'wait. This definitely reminds me of him.' This brought up the whole question of whether or not it was an actual abusive relationship.\n\nIf anyone has any insight into this, feel free to respond.

So whilst me and my brother are painting a room, my youngest brother calles my mother 67 times and threatens that if she doesnt answer he will post horrid things on facebook for our family to see as well as message her boyfriend lies to break up their relationship because my mom hadnt left him money for takeout and he demanded she send him her card info so thst he could purchase food told her she better go grocery shopping before we came home (it was 11:30pm).\nSo fast forward, my mom had me and my brother go pick up my other brother McDonalds so he wouldnt be in a bad mood when she got home.\nUpin arriving home I gave him his food and everything was fine until he wanted to do his laundry.

To which he ran to the kitchen and grabbed a knife and shoved me again and told me if I didnt do as he said he would pop my tires and I wouldnt be able to go to work tomorrow.\n\nI hate that im so afraid of my younger brother, but hes so emotionally and physically abusive towards me and my mom I have no clue what to do, he wont move out due to him financually abusing my mom.

I caught him once as a young child in a game of tag and he gave me a black eye. If I was about to win a video game against him he would pull the plug. As I got older, he would threaten me with slander, say no one would believe me and would try to get me into trouble with my parents. He hit me, threw me into walls and would constantly call me names. Names which included fat whore, ugly, bitch, idiot etc. If a man was in the same room as me he would make incredibly sexual comments about how I wanted to wrap my legs around him etc. When I spoke in front of people our age, he would say things like \u201cdid I give you permission to speak fat stupid bitch\u201d.\n\nHe also had other strange behaviour. He used scream at me for periods of time when we are alone accusing me of raping pigs/ using pigs. He would start screaming sometimes \"stop raping the pigs they don't want you, stop using them\". He also told me he gave one of his friends permission to plough me. He would tell me he couldn't wait until I was going to die so he could dance on my grave. My father caught me self-harming as a teen and my parents told my brother. My brother used then act out someone slitting their wrists in front of me and called me a mentally unstable crazy bitch and encouraged me to kill myself. He lied on the regular and sometimes got me into trouble with my parents as they believed him. My mother told me after I self-harmed that if I wanted to kill myself to go to different stores and buy paracetamol and not leave blood on her floor. She also said she thought she had a normal life but I was not normal and threatened me with being locked up in a psych ward if I continued to behave the way I did again. The psychiatrist I was made see told my parents there was nothing wrong with me and I was just wasting his time. I was asked questions such as if I was a goth, on drugs, sexually active etc. He informed my parents that half of the country were self-harming.\n\nMy parents went away abroad one time and we were left alone in the house together. I was 17, he was about 18. He invited about 50 kids his age. One of his male friends grabbed me around the waist dragged me across the room in front of my brother and asked his other friends if he wanted to see him fuck me. I slapped his friend across the face. Not long after my brother hit me full force into a wall and I hit the ground. When my parents came back my mother got angry with me because she told me my brother said my behaviour was inappropriate towards his friends. She called me a psycho and said I should be ashamed of myself.\n\nWhen I started University, he told me repeatedly my degree (Business and Political Science) was for people who are so stupid they are mentally disabled and that he would be a doctor. He was very condescending, rude and judgemental of everything I did and made sure to point it out to everyone. He was incredibly envious and judgemental of other people as well. He had a huge ego and thought he was better than everyone.\n\nHe would hit my dog and call him a retard and other names. He was incredibly angry towards disabled people, homosexuals and black people. On the regular he would boast about fucking \"sluts\" and how he used prostitutes, how all women wanted him etc. He accused me of wanting him sexually as well as being inappropriate towards him. Fast forward a few years and he has falsely accused my parents of extreme physical and emotional abuse to the police. My brother hacked my mothers online account and sent threatening messages to himself and then showed the police. He also made a false sexual assault claim against an autistic boy.\n\nHe has a good job now and is trying to get in contact with me. He is blaming everything on my mother for this bad behaviour and has made some serious claims against my father.

They all seemed to fit a certain type. They lived in his country. \n\nI was the opposite. I wasn't his usual \"type\". I also was not available to see him ever, being a plane ride away. He had no reason to even see me. It was basically an online situationship.\n\nWhen I found out he has a new girlfriend now, who again, is his type and lives in his country - it just reinforced those beliefs.\n\nI'm realising that the problem is I'm continually obsessing over reasons why maybe I was the only one that was treated the way I did. The reasons I come up with are generally\n\n* I wasn't his type so he didn't really want me anyway; he didn't really like me; he probably thought I was gross, etc.\n* I was in a different country and he literally never met up with me and therefore he could keep me hidden --&gt; so keeping up his reputation there with \"real relationships\" and just using me\n\n\\--&gt; therefore, \"I was easier to use and abuse (for negative supply?), and he would treat this new girl much better than me\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThings I know as facts\n\n* he love-bombed me (saying he loved me online before even knowing if I was real or who I was.... ok)\n* I got a 'dodgy feeling' about him that made me want to leave early on, but I couldn't\n* he gave me the silent treatment\n* he gave me three STDs the one and only time we met despite telling me he was clean; and then proceeding to give me so many bullshit confusing stories about how he got them (including blaming me) that I gave up\n* he lied to me about his exes and continued to engage with them - despite initially telling me they were crazy and blocked (nope)\n* he kept me completely hidden from everyone and everything in his life... including keeping his fb status as 'single'\n* he run me in circles\n* he tried to shut me up with DARVO every time I found something shady\n* he constantly told me I was the abusive, nasty, cruel one - enjoying putting him down.... when I was previously known as the kindest, nicest girl ever\n* he kept everything hidden from me (and blamed me for it) - didn't stop me finding stuff out though...\n* he used dating apps to \"boost his ego\"\n* he constantly compared me with everyone in his life\n* he met other girls on nights out while blocking me on his phone\n* he used the idealise -&gt; devalue -&gt; discard cycle. quite a few times. again, I was the one that went crawling back every time, so he told me it was me creating this cycle.... but I don't know\n* he discarded me as a punishment\n* he blamed me for his moving on so quickly.... told me I made him feel like he had to\n* his actions didn't meet up with his words\n* he triangulated me to the extreme - it was insane, his ex, other girls, you name it\n* he used gaslighting on me all. the. time\n* he lied, he lied, he lied...... and blamed me for his lying (\"because I knew how you'd react\")\n* he actively told me I had to \"prove myself\" to him because I was the one that went back to him, and I had no right to act out\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLike - those things aren\u2019t normal? Right?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI was not blameless... at all. I was needy, insecure, jealous and at times acted completely batshit crazy. I will completely adit that. But... pretty much all after the above. I'm not proud of it. I was passive aggressive. I was argumentative. I kept fighting and fighting for answers I would never get. I was constantly in a state of desperation. One wrong move and I knew I would lose him, but I couldn't stop myself from acting out.\n\nHowever... I know I have never acted this way with any of my family relationships or friendships.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI think the difficulty lies in the fact that I am continuing to look for reasons that I wasn't enough. Initially it was that I was crazy, and jealous, and insecure, and maybe that's why. Then I started to turn to reasons that I can't really control - such as the way I look (which he used against me in the later stages) or the fact that I live in a different country.\n\nReasons that meant it was easier to abuse \"just me\" while he could continue his happy little relationships over there and seeming totally normal to everyone else\n\nI will never have the 'validation' that he treats everyone like this. I'll never know. If I try and contact anyone in his life (which I have) I am sure he tells them he doesn't even know who I am. I'll come across as even more psycho.\n\nAnd I know it sounds awful... it's just I keep wondering if it was just me, why it was just me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI think the switch I need to make is realising that someone that did the above things..... no matter how crazy I acted at times....... isn't a good person.\n\nIt's like, I want to know it wasn't just me. And that's kind of selfish. But at the same time I'm desperate to come up with reasons why maybe it WAS just me.\n\nI just find it unfair that he gets to be happy and loving and blah and ride off into the sunset with this new girl thats his type and nearby and she gets everything I wanted and I'm left with all this pain.\n\nBut the truth is..... I shouldn't be thinking that. I should be thinking that someone who can do the above, isn't a good person. Just because he made me feel undesirable and unloveable.... doesn't mean I'm undesirable and unloveable. :(\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBut somehow I just feel I need to kNOW. I need proof. But I don't. I don't want to be checking up on their relationship to see if its ended for years. At the same time a really messed up part of me does. But to be honest... I don't know if it would make me feel better at all.\n\nIt's like... WHAT IF he treated them all and will treat them all better? Because I'll never really know\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI think this is the switch I have to make. Because the above - and the much, much more that I will never know about - is enough, right? To tell me that at the very least... he's disordered? He's not quite right? He's not normal? Right? I think so.... but then I doubt it sometimes. And if my therapist or family say so, I'll say \"but you never met him! Maybe I'm just saying it to make it seem like he's bad?\"\n\nWhy can't I make myself just believe that he was bad? What will it take?\n\nI'm sorry that was long. I'm still trying to clear my head up. I just think I need to somehow make that snap, but I keep doubting it. I'm just trying to make sense of it all... this sub is really helping me. I just need to somehow get there", "subreddit": "NarcissisticAbuse"}

I don\u2019t even care about what you\u2019ve told your friends about me because I know exactly what it is and so do you. You, peyton, YOU are the god damn narcissist. You\u2019re so wound up in your own shit 24/7 you can\u2019t possibly stop to think about anything other than how you perceive it or how much you\u2019re hurting or how much you can\u2019t handle it after you do shitty shit. No one is obligated to stand by someone who\u2019s being abusive and you have got to see that\u2019s what you\u2019re doing. No one would have stuck with you this long and that\u2019s just being honest. You are the one that shows people a mask. You\u2019re the one that keeps the real manipulative fucked up shit you do behind closed doors and then paint yourself out to be the victim. I for so long didn\u2019t see the way you were controlling me, the way it steadily got worse to the point I haven\u2019t for so long known what to do and doubted my own sanity and judgment. Because that\u2019s why you freak out, you know I\u2019m not letting you control me or my choices anymore. I was so blind, because I always assumed you loved me and only had the best intentions. You had your own agenda and want and needs first always, even if you haven\u2019t seen it that way. You don\u2019t even see how selfish and ungrateful you are to me, your family, the universe. You couldn\u2019t even process it, because to you you\u2019re just being done so wrongly that it\u2019s unfair. You did this to yourself. You make me feel the worst i have ever felt, then come right back panicked because you can\u2019t be alone. You use me because you can\u2019t be alone. You use me like a safety blanket, but just because I love you, and will always have love for you doesn\u2019t mean I have I have to put up with your backwards fucked up shit. I love you, but you don\u2019t deserve it. Not anymore. Maybe one day we\u2019ll come back to each other better, but right now I can\u2019t see anyway of being with you without constantly feeling worthless. I asked you twice a month or so back to be my boyfriend, you said no both times, while still demanding my love and attention and time without any regard for how I felt. Making me feel guilty for wanting to go home, see my family, or hang out with friends. You said on the phone \u201cYour SO should not be your \u201cwhole world\u201d\u201d but you were so damn determined to be mine. You couldn\u2019t even see you already were. Because to you I deserve it. You\u2019ll always believe I cheated on you. I\u2019ll never get the sounds of you calling me all that stuff out of my head.

One day she came back, cried and said it was the worst thing she had ever done.\n3. She played with my head even though she did not know if she liked me.\n4. She came on to me very strong.\n5. She appeared at my door when I could not see her, but I received her anyway.\n6. All my limits she broke, violated.\n7. She forced me into touching her...\n8. She talked about her exs during sex.\n9. She made minor comments about me, my ex, my life etc.\n10. She even told me her orgasms with me were not as strong etc etc etc.\n11. She cheated on me. God knows how many times.\n12. She called me to tell me she was back to her ex. She never called, the only time she did was  to hurt me telling me this shit.\n13. She kissed me in front of her family days before pretending we were nothing. It makes sense in the context (she had not broken up with her ex, they knew, I did not).\n14. I was the other person, the piece of shit her used for sex, distraction.\n15. She would never be there for me if I asked her to.\n16. She would always be there if she wanted me for something.\n17. She almost killed me trying to have sex no stop while I was really ill.\n18. She withhold sex  with no apparent reason, and I was ok with it. The problem is that was cold and cruel.\n19. She told me she would marry that guy she hated.\n20. I said we could find a place to live together, so she would solve some of her problems. She then started to look for an apt with her ex/not-so-ex/now to be husband.\n21. I asked her to sit down with me to talk, at least finish things the right way. Well, 2, 3-ish months I do not really see her. If I had asked her to leave me alone, she would be here I guess.\n22. THE WORST OF ALL: If you stay with me, you will never  know  what I am thinking, who I am thinking about. If I love you or him. I do not want to erase him of my life. (She said it while she erased me all together from her life). How fuck up can someone be? She could just say \\*I think we should break up, here is why\\* and give me some BS excuse since she loves to tell me lies.\n23. Our LAST TIME was our last time and she  knew it. It was all a game. She made things worse. I thought all was fine, but she left me 12 hours after that.\n24. I moved from my city to be with her. Lost my job in the transition. She stopped seeing me.\n25. All the things my exs had done to me, she knew. I cried on her arms two times. She was my friend for a long time before turning to me for sex. She asked me about my fears etc and she knew my exs, the two I had had were abusive. She abused me 100x worse, made a 100x more painful imitation of  what they did and beyond.\n26. She took my weakest trait and justified her actions based on it like she was a better version of me: ***I cannot do differently in relation to you, she said, and I am not sorry. It is who I am and what I need and I need to respect myself.*** *So* *s*he thinks destroying people is respecting herself? These words (*self respect, think about you firs*t) are triggers to me. It is like she was trying to avoid my development at any cost.\n27. Something that kills me. I asked her to pick me up at the airport so we could finally talk about things. She did not show up. A girl was waiting for someone, she brought flowers. I thought my ex would do something like this. I was on the floor, hyper sad. Instead of picking me up, she went to a party. I never saw her again. It has been two months since I got back home.\n28. I asked her 1 month and a few days ago: would you call me when you get this message? Please, call me back I am not doing well. She never ever got back to me, instead she blocked me on her phone.\n29. Once I dropped her off at a friend's party, now I know she was there with her ex... they were there publicly as a couple.\n30. My ex comments: I always thought I liked something different from you... wow, you look good naked, I thought you looked differently.  I did not know your kiss would be that good... you do not seem the kind of person who has 'it' in you. These comments were meant to be good. Was it supposed to be good? It made me feel like shit.\n31. Now I just realize I am in the second discard, not the first. Oh my god, I was so blind.Once my ex made me feel so worthless that I told her I need to stay away, and said the word 'fuck' on the sms I sent. She came back running and as sick as it seems, she told me once 'you said I should fuck myself, and I could not stay away from you'. So now I see. I see! P.s: I did not say 'go fuck your self' she did not even read my sms right.\n32. Like my ex saying she was back with her ex. She had not broken with me and while telling me she went back a few weeks ago, she said: *I do not see what you think I did wrong.* \n33. Or she saying she was going to break up with her ex when we were just friends in love. I said, please, even if you do not break up with him, do not sleep with him while I am in town.

I didn\u2019t start masturbating or thinking about actually having sex until 20. I don\u2019t know why, but I am unable to experience physical sexual attraction. My desire for sex comes from a deep emotional bond and trust with a specific person. My sexuality is weird and complicated and so deeply tied into loyalty that when I feel like I\u2019ve found the one no one else even crosses my mind. It\u2019s like I have laser vision.\n\nUnfortunately, my Nex was the one. He was the first person I ever trusted enough to be completely vulnerable with, and he never rushed me. We were friends for a year before dating and during that time he never sexually harassed or pressured me (something I\u2019m used to men doing). We were in an LDR, but in terms of what we were able to do he was pretty much my first everything, and I hate to give him the credit but he was great. He was absolutely amazing at everything we did.\n\nI\u2019m still a virgin. I started dating him at 21 and he told me he was also a virgin. It was a lie. He would tell me \u201cI love you\u201d multiple times every time we did stuff. He would mention how he can\u2019t wait for me to be his first. Everything was always intimate and emotional and vulnerable. I don\u2019t understand how someone can be so conniving.\n\nWhen I was with him I wanted to be intimate all the time. My sex drive was through the roof. Towards the end of our relationship he started to tell me his sex drive disappeared because he was sick and his pills messed up his libido, turns out he just needed to save his sexual energy for the tens of other girls he was messing with.\n\nHe went out of his way to keep up this lie for the entire 2+ years I\u2019ve known him. I just don\u2019t get it. I\u2019m mad at him, but I\u2019m also mad at myself for ever trusting him.

I understand a lot of people here struggle with narc SO's, and I'm so thankful I wasn't in such a committed relationship. \n\nShe messaged me a couple days ago, but whenever she tries to initiate contact I get so emotionally distressed. And it was hard for me to understand why her just saying hi was so difficult for me to cope with. But yesterday I happened to look into narcissism after someone had mentioned it, and I realized she hit so much of the criteria. She might not be full blown NPD, but she definitely hits a lot of the red flags. \n\nI'm in shock right now, as I'm watching all the pieces fit together and finally see the reasons for all of her actions. I just feel a need to share my experience. \n\nThe most prominent red flag is that everything was about her. Every time I tried to talk about my struggles or experiences, she found a way to twist it into a conversation about her. She managed to take all the attention. All of it. For so long I just thought I was in a one sided friendship. But it wasn't just that she didn't care about my feelings, she drained so much of my energy. \n\nI realize now that there was a reason that she constantly hit me. She constantly called me a bitch (among other insults) and the moment I told her it made me upset she told me I was \"too sensitive\". Every time I tried to tell her I was hurt by her words I couldn't \"take a joke\". \n\nShe constantly monopolized me, my energy, and my time. There were so many times where she told me that she was the only best friend I could have. She cut me off from so many people. \n\nNothing I ever did was good enough. It was always my fault. There were so many times when I thought, \"she'll be really mad, so I shouldn't do x.\" \n\nEvery time I pulled away she clung onto me, and made our friendship look so ideal. If I wouldn't contact her, she would contact my mom to tell me to talk to her. She worked so hard to make sure my mom loved her because she knew that would influence me to keep contact with her. \n\nWhenever I was successful it was her doing. She always, always told me \"I made you into another version of me\". She believed she made me into who I was. \n\nShe constantly emphasized how much I needed her. How dumb I was and how I wouldn't be alive/social/successful without her. \n\nWhenever I tried to hang out with other people she would share her opinion about them, and it was never positive. She would tell me she had some sort of right over me because we've been friends for longer or whatever. \n\nWhen I realized I was in love and began a relationship with my now SO, I was so excited to tell her, and she gave me a \"I knew it all along.\" \n\nThe first time I started seriously hanging out with another person who cared about my words and thoughts it was such a relief. The more I broke away from her the free-er I felt. \n\nAnd eventually, I moved across the country to get away from her. Over a thousand miles is what it took to get me out of that toxic relationship. \n\nI was visiting a friend at a college in my hometown a year and a half after moving, and I happened to run into her. I remember telling her college was hard for me because it was so expensive, and she made a point to tell me how she was getting paid to go to college. She wasn't in debt, she was getting paid. Ofc she knew that college would be expensive for me, I was dumb for going to college so far away, etc. \n\nAnd the last thing she said to me was \"I want to punch you. And not in the joking way, I actually want to punch you.\" \n\nSorry this is so long. It all hit me yesterday and today and I just can't believe I was being manipulated for so long. But more so I can't believe how much she matches up with all the manipulation tactics I saw in the community info. Thanks for reading.", "subreddit": "NarcissisticAbuse"}

I have had severe anxiety, PTSD, and depression since I was 4 years old when I was locked in a closet 24/7 by my fathers girlfriend who mentally abused me, physically, and molested me with her friends (*If you want to know what happened after let me know*). At the age of 15, ma and I had to leave everything behind to escape from my sister who threatened to hurt us. We went from shelter to shelter and by the time we found an apartment we were mentally fucked. We both suffer from ptsd and having two minds like that clash caused us to be mentally abusive with each other (*at first*). She would constantly threaten to kick me out since the age of 16 (*I am 22 now*) whenever I did something wrong. Ever since that age, I have been always scared every day on whether or not I will be kicked out. Now when I was 17-18 years old she became bed bound. She can walk, but only short distances with assistance depending on how her body is doing because of this I became her caretaker at age 17. Constantly helping her and putting her first instead of my own. This has put a mental toll on me because when I was in high school I always had a 3.5 GPA, in college a 3.2 GPA, but had to drop out because the stress of taking care of my mother was getting too much for me mentally and physically. I would be the only one doing the cooking, cleaning, grocery shopping, walking the dogs, going with her to her doctor appointments,etc. None of it is appreciated (*by the way I am mentally and physically disabled so it took a toll on my body too so I couldnt get a job*) because she says it is her money why should be appreciate anything I do by spending her money? That is what she says, I am like I use my time to take care of you, I don't have to, but I do it because I care. This mentally took a toll on me by making my conditions worse and causing me to stop caring for my future and the health of the apartment which resulted in us to get roaches. The constant stress has had me get another disorder called Disassociation Disorder where it is hard to connect with myself with reality and others. It has gotten so bad that when I tried to leave she has gotten physical with me to get my phone to prevent any communication with people to help me leave (she has done this too many times to count). One time this happened she got physical with me, slapped me, clawed me, grabbed my hair, got on top of me, then my fight or flight instincts kicked in and ended up hitting her on the head twice because I was so scared. She went limp and I tried to make sure she was okay and helped her back to bed. Shit like this has had me scared ever since. Reminder her and I would curse at each other, but my mother went beyond that...Even though my mom is disabled I have seen her fight off people full strength that hits like a man because of her neuropathy which causes her muscles to be tight all the time which also gives you super strength that makes you hit like a man. She even prevented from bringing my stuff because it was hers even though my expensive stuff I bought with my money was mine, but she said it was hers since it was through her card, so I was stuck.\n\n**Currently:** She signed the lease online pretending to be me and signed my name herself online. I understand she is bedridden, but recently she told me that I am a sociopath and have no hope for me getting better (*summed up version*). I wanted to take her electric chair (*currently hard to walk because of my problems crippling me*) drive down to the huge canal and drive off of it. I have never really attempted suicide, but at that moment I just wanted peace. Luckily after a card reading (*I was told to follow love for myself or anothe*r) and god listening peace has shown up... Right now I am so scared of leaving because of what my mother has done to me in the past. My best friend of 10 years (*boyfriend of 4 years of when we were children, currently dating again as of March 28th*) has offered me to move in with him. I am going to have to leave everything behind except the stuff I bought, not ever all the stuff I bought, just the most important. I am so petrified that she will find me and have me arrested for something I didn't do. I don't care if I have to pay an exit fee, but I doubt I have to since she has housing and I am not on it. I know she has services that can get her an in-home nurse to help her.\n\n**Questions:** Do you think I am in the wrong? Do you think I could possibly be arrested for just up and leaving? Do you think I can get arrested for infesting an apartment with roaches and leaving?\n\n**Conclusion?:** I mean I am willing to pay money if they say I owe it, but legally I mean. I just am scared to be in this apartment one more day. Next Monday or Tuesday I am packing my bookbag with my stuff and my boyfriend is going to get me a ticket to where he currently lives. I will let yall know how it goes when I am in the arms of my boyfriend safe again...\n\n* Edit: Tonight I am leaving at 3 am to the airport, wish me luck.\n* Edit 2: Today is the second day I am at my bfs house. As soon as I landed I started getting a crap loads of messages from my mom, I have not read them yet because I am scared to. Another thing is that there is a voicemail on my phone, my bf wants to listen to it without me to make sure it won't mess me up mentally. My bf told me to wait a week and when I am ready we will read it, but also she had her friend text me and asking me to make sure I am alright and they are making sure that my mother is being taken care of. I will post screenshots of what my mothers friend said, but later on, when I am ready I will read what my mother has sent me and I will show you all if I can.\n\n[Moms friend messaging me](https://i.redd.it/g7ogr6z53us21.png)\n\n* Edit 3: Here is a full update if all of yall want to know, with proof!!:   [https://www.reddit.com/r/abuse/comments/bfi3db/update\\_left\\_my\\_abusive\\_mother\\_and\\_now\\_wont\\_be/](https://www.reddit.com/r/abuse/comments/bfi3db/update_left_my_abusive_mother_and_now_wont_be/)  \n\n*  Edit 4: I put an update 2 on my mental health: [https://www.reddit.com/r/abuse/comments/biftjt/update\\_2\\_the\\_aftereffects/](https://www.reddit.com/r/abuse/comments/biftjt/update_2_the_aftereffects/)", "subreddit": "abuse"}

My sister-in-law was frantic.

Is it giving up if I leave her? Is my gut right on this?\n\nHi all, throwaway account because she stalks my other one.\n\nI'm needing some advice, and just someone I can talk to.\n\nBackground history: My fianc\u00e9e and I have been together for just over 3 years. We bought a house together a year ago. We already started planning our wedding for later this year.\n\nMy background history: My childhood was very toxic growing up. My parents were/are addicted to crack, there was severe neglect, abuse, and manipulation that went on until I got the hell out of there at 18. Needless to say this fucked me up. Growing up, and even when I was still speaking to my mum, she would say things like: \"we loved you and your siblings\", \"the abuse never happened\", \"we did the best we could\". This also fucked with me, because I believed her for the longest time, didn't trust myself, and put all of the blame on me.\n\nWorking through all this and taking space from my mum allowed me to have a mind shift. My mum is wrong, in all ways. She abused me, she didn't love me, it wasn't my fault, she was not a good parent, and it all came down to her choices.\n\nMy fianc\u00e9e knows everything about my childhood. I've had to set boundaries (reasonable, healthy ones, or so I thought) in our relationship, and she's repeatedly broken them. Space is a huge coping mechanism I've learned from counselling and she refuses to let me have it. There have been times where she has physically blocked the door when we are fighting, and times where she's grabbed me to pull me back. I've also expressed to her that I will not be with anyone that is verbally or physically abusive.\n\nShe says she's not and it fucks with me due to my history. Help me out reddit friends.\n\n\\- she refuses to give me space, makes me feel bad about taking it, is this manipulative?\n\n\\- she says things like fuck you, fuck off, you're such a fucking asshole, etc. threatens to leave, and then says that she has no control over herself and I make her get to this point, again, is this abuse and/or manipulative?\n\n\\- it has gotten physical a couple of times, she's thrown something at me (a pillow) but it was when we were fighting and it triggered me to push her away, which made her blame me for grabbing her\n\n\\- I've also had to physically move her out of the way to get out when she's trapped me, and once when I was trying to drive away she would not get away from the car, again accusing me of trying to run her over\n\nDo all couples go through things like this, is this normal? It may seem simple of me to ask, but because of my past I'm all over the place. She repeatedly disrespects my boundaries, and then when she sees that I am serious about leaving, she says okay I'll do this, this and this, to work on myself and fix things. It never happens.\n\nShe says things like she can't live without me, she doesn't want to be without me, wants to spend all her time with me, and that she puts all her energy into making me happy. I can't breathe! When we are not fighting, we are fine, but I don't even know if this is a healthy relationship to begin with.\n\nShe has issues, we both do, this I know. But my gut is telling me that this isn't going to get any better. Marriage isn't going to change it, and neither are kids. And I am NOT bringing children into an environment like this.\n\nLastly, I've wanted to join the military my whole life, and have been in and out already. She knew this from day one, before we even started talking. She disagrees with everything having to do with the military, we've fought about it many times. I've compromised by joining the reserves, but what I really want to do is go full time and make it a career. This is not the first time that I've held back from joining because of a girl in my life. I don't want to have any regrets, and I know I will if I don't do this now. I just feel like I'm done, she doesn't respect me or love me in my opinion, and the shit she is doing is bringing up things from my childhood and really messing with my head. I don't trust her anymore.\n\nIt comes down to me being scared of finding anyone else to love me if I leave, due to all my baggage. I feel bad for her, the same way I felt bad for my mum, but it comes down to choices and I honestly don't see her trying to get better. My mental health is suffering because of this.

Whenever I would bring it up with them, they would tell me they just needed a break, which didn't make any sense to me because as far as I could tell, I hadn't done anything to *them* (however, I had gotten into a fight with a mutual but they were in no way involved in that event). I heard them talk about me behind my back, calling me a bitch and stupid and fat (which is funny to me considering that they all know I've been struggling with bulimia for six years now, and I'm smaller than any of them are). One of these people had previously given me trouble by calling me abusive and manipulative when I told her I didn't want to be friends anymore after she cancelled plans on me, last minute, five times in a row. She really made me hate myself and genuinely wonder if I was abusive and manipulative like she said.\n\nI'm still in high school, so I see these people in the hallways but luckily I don't share any classes with them. I do, however, sit with three of them at lunch, one of them (the worst of the bunch) sits directly across from me. He has stolen money, an expensive calculator, and attempted to steal my phone from me. What's worse is that any time I move, I immediately start to hear them talk about me, about how pathetic I am and that I can't handle them. I mean in reality I used to play hockey, I've knocked out a girl's teeth before and I'm not afraid to do it again, but what gets to me most is the way they insult me because I'm transgender (FTM). The boy that sits across from me is also trans, and I actually helped him come out when I still thought we were friends. Now, I hear him try to say I'm not really a boy, that I'm just faking being trans for attention.\n\nBut the worst thing - my best friend still sees them as friends. She tells me that she doesn't want me to move, but she doesn't want them to leave either. I've asked her if she and I could just go sit with other people together, but she told me that she still wanted to be friends with them. She knows what they've said about me and how one of them stole from me and used me, but she still insists on being friends with them. I don't want to make her pick a side but I want to be healthy, too. I want *her* to be healthy. I've already seen them try to take advantage of her by taking her money without her permission. Whenever she would get upset, they just said they would pay her back (they don't). I really genuinely don't know what to do anymore. I'm a junior and I know that I'll never see them again after high school, but there's still a chance I'll be forced to be around them my senior year too.

Depending on how severe it was for your nex, the person you fell in love with was either a complete fabrication or real but misguided. \n\nI think my nex was the latter. The romantic moments we had were real. The little things he did to show he cared were real. The good guy I saw was real and he was trying during and after the relationship because he didn't want to lose me. Unfortunately there are some things you can't come back from, like sexual assault and the repeated blaming, backpedaling, inability to take responsibility, gaslighting, and contradictory excuses. \n\nAfter the breakup, he tried to show that he changed, but he didn't learn from the mistakes he made that drove us apart. Yes, it had only been a month or two after the breakup and change takes so much time and effort, but how he mistreated me hurt me so much that I couldn't let myself be vulnerable around him and you should be able to trust your partner without a doubt. If he apologized he just told me what I wanted to hear but later he'd do the same down playing and excusing of his actions, which killed me inside. I didn't want to be friends and try again like he wanted, which caused him to be more openly disrespectful by making comments and backpedaling to still keep me in his life. \n\nI don't love him anymore and we can't be in each other's lives because of everything that happened. I accept and am at peace with that, but part of me still cares. I broke NC a couple of days ago to tell him to see a therapist. He needs to unlearn his toxic behavior and to learn mindfulness of himself and others. \n\nMaybe I'm being naive and hopeful but I think if he keeps his willingness to change, if he puts effort and actually sees a therapist like he said he would, then he might actually be able to change and truly be happy. Despite everything he put me through I think he can be a good person. I fell in love with that person. I wanted marriage and children with that person... But sadly that couldn't happen because his toxicity infected the relationship and infected me. It became too broken to fix. \n\nMy only wish is that after all of this, he makes those changes and becomes the man I loved and doesn't let his selfish, inconsiderate tendencies ruin things.

My mother's boyfriend was an alcoholic and drug user. My mother was neglectful. We had fleas and I was constantly being eaten up by them. I still have over a hundred scars from the bites and a fear of fleas. I suffered from anxiety and depression and the meds were no longer helping me cope. I moved in with my father and step-mom my senior year. Things were good at first. Then the arguments started. Some were stupid arguments that teens have with their parents, but it started to become abusive. My step-mother would call me lazy and worthless for being a full-time student in highschool. She yelled at me about the most minor things. I once forgot to take out the trash (which I did every single day) and she literally yelled at me for a solid hour. When my little brother (who is special needs) had his first baseball game, I stayed behind to get some house work done to make my parents happy. Me and him discussed it and he was okay with it because i promised to attend every game after that (which I did). My step-mother proceeds to call me a bad sibling and said that I wouldn't be able to take care of him if they died. Another time she accused me of not loving him because I wouldn't volunteer at the Special Olympics in our city. I had severe social anxiety at the time but that wasn't a good excuse according to her. \n\nAll of that sucked, but it was nothing compared to what happened a year ago. I had revealed to a friend that I was having suicidal thoughts and she told our college counselor. They contacted my father and he asked me why I didn't tell him. I stated that i had told him and my step-mom multiple times, but they never did anything to get me help. All they gave me was empty promises. He left for work and didn't say much. When my step-mom got home, she started yelling at my brother for not being able to wipe himself  (not his fault) and then yelled at me for 3 hours. She called me a liar, a spoiled brat, and claimed that my depression was my own fault. It was the worst day of my life and I still suffer from severe issues because of it. I ended up moving back to my mom's hometown after she cleaned up her act and we reconciled. I met a beautiful girl and began living with her. She's the one that made me realize how abusive my step-mother and dad actually were and she's helped me through so much. But ever since I moved back, I've had to deal with a lot of drama with my dad and step-mom. It's caused my mental health to get worse and I've been having more frequent depression spells, I've been very frustrated, and I've been very irritable. My gf also suffers from depression and I feel like I haven't been a good girlfriend to her.

I moved across the world so that we could be together, since my being so far away from him, even though it was for work, was why we had so many problems.. or so he told me.  After I packed up everything and moved across an ocean; something he \"couldn't do\" I still wasn't enough. Once finally there, He told me that i wasn't there for him, and it wasn't because i loved him, it was something other than him, and i needed to figure it out for myself and when i did i was to tell him. But i had nothing and no one there but him. He wouldn't give me space in the closet for my clothes, but would yell at me for my stuff being everywhere; he didn't like how my 3 bottles of 1.body wash, 2.shampoo &amp; 3.conditioner cluttered the shower. I drank all the tea, ate all the cereal, and didn't properly separate our clothes when i did laundry, somehow i was always stealing his socks or hiding them so he couldn't find them, when i wasn't. his socks were RIGHT THERE, but he swore up and down that they weren't his. He locked me IN the house when i had plans to go out, so i couldn't go, and told me that i was stealing time away from him. I couldn't call the cops, because he had told his family that i said that if i couldn't be with him, i would send him to jail for some made up excuse; so i was discredited no matter what i did or said.  I when i spoke with friends and fam back home, he would make me put them on speaker phone and then said that they didn't tell me things that he thought i needed to hear, so i didn't need to speak to them. Money i spent on feminine hygiene products was money i was \"hiding from him\", and \"wasting\" because i should have been pregnant, and the fact that i wasn't after 3 years of marriage meant i was failing to be \"a real woman\". I couldn't get my hair done because i wasn't doing it for him, i was doing it for myself, and that was unacceptable and made me a selfish and thoughtless person. I couldn't breath a certain way, because it meant something that was confrontational to him, and all i \"wanted to do was fight\"; i couldn't blink because my blinks meant more than i would admit to him.  I was always wrong and out to get him, even when i wasn't. Even when i escaped and was able to get away him, i was being selfish and not thinking of him.  He wouldn't agree to a divorce because he needed to be close to me, and the idea that we were still married gave him that connection that he said he needed. When my dad tried to help and intercede, I was accused of \"sending an assassin out\" to get him. (i'm an only daughter of a career Army guy, and a daddy's girl so its very possible that WAS the case, but if it was, i had no idea.)\n\nI couldn't open email, i couldn't answer phone numbers from his area code, i felt like i couldn't breath, couldn't think.  I questioned EVERYTHING... even when he was hundreds of miles away, i was looking over my shoulder and wonder when he would come for my piece of mind again. With him, i went somewhere i never thought i would end up, and let someone do to me something i never thought i would ever let do to me. I have PTSD from the situation that I now have to deal with. It took a therapist, looking me in the eye and telling me \" that's a horrible situation, what did to survive is so strong and significant?\" I had no idea i was being strong. when i left him, i felt small, insignificant, defeated, embarrassed, i questioned everything i did, every move i made and every single breath and blink i took, I questioned myself. But i kept moving forward best i could, because i didn't want to go back. And i'm lucky i did.\n\nFinally, i was able to stand up and get the divorce i had been waiting for for years. and when i got that letter confirming the completion of it; i felt as though i could take a deep breath for the first time in years...the thousand pound boulder on my shoulders had finally lifted and i am finally free. \n\nSince then, I have literally stumbled into someone who is the absolute opposite of what my NEX was. And I'm so lucky to have found someone that lets me be me without judgement. Who makes space in his life for me without a second thought. And someone, who, as imperfect as I am; and in that, he is the most perfect person for me... because he, understands what I've been through, acknowledges it and when I faultier in my self belief, he won't let me believe that I am anything but perfect. \n\nI used to think that the light at the end of the tunnel was just another train, coming to run me over and break me again... but it wasn't... it was indeed the sun, with clear skies, and air that was clean, refreshing, and oh-so-easy to breath in.", "subreddit": "NarcissisticAbuse"}

Then a few days later my Nex told me his wife only had six months to live. I was done with the lies and knew I had to get rid of him but I knew he wouldn\u2019t let me break up with him so I did something I knew would make him incredibly angry, I messaged his wife on Facebook.

I\u2019ve always struggled with black and white thinking in any sense, and this situation is no different for me.\n\nI keep trying to convince myself that my Nex has some good in him. I know I will never be in a relationship with him again, and I will never trust him again, but I\u2019m not gonna lie and say that I\u2019m not currently hoping for him to still be in my life somehow down the line. I\u2019m convincing myself that I can eventually keep him around if I keep him at a distance, if I\u2019m aware of his NPD and recognize that I\u2019ll never trust him again. That could change once I heal, but god dammit I want to just be honest about how I\u2019m feeling right now. I can\u2019t celebrate NC or that I\u2019m in therapy or that he hasn\u2019t contacted me because those things do not make me feel good like they\u2019re supposed to. I sit around thinking about him 24/7, checking his socials, and waiting for him to contact me.\n\nI\u2019m NC, but I guess it doesn\u2019t really count because I\u2019ve opened back up all channels for him to contact me. I had him blocked for a couple of days, but I realized that I had one final thing to say, so I unblocked. I wrote it out and I have it ready to go. I obsessed so much over it that I did research asking actual narcs what has been said to them that made them gain self-awareness and want to change. I read it every day, confident that it\u2019s perfect and almost excited for him to message me so I can send it.\n\nI haven\u2019t contacted him and he hasn\u2019t contacted me.

So my SO (20M) claims to me that he\u2019s a narcissist, I don\u2019t think he\u2019s been formally diagnosed for this (he has been diagnosed for bipolar disorder). I (20F) know a little about narcissism from reading and a close friend of mine from high school was an N so I feel like I have an idea of what it can look like. Honestly, I don\u2019t see my SO as that much of an N? I read that it\u2019s on a spectrum, and everyone should have a healthy amount, but I don\u2019t see him as crossing over into the unhealthy, which is what he claims. \nThe only things that really described him from what I read would be the elevated sense of self; an example: he\u2019ll say \u201cthey all think of me as a god\u201d, but if I ask if they really think that he\u2019ll say \u201cno that\u2019s probably my narcissism\u201d. And that he doesn\u2019t take criticism. He used to shut down at negative stuff but I called him out on it and explained to him how it kinda made me feel like he was gaslighting (his mom does this to him so the comparison hit home for him, I was really just pointing out how it\u2019s a manipulative behavior), and since that conversation he doesn\u2019t really react that way to negative stuff. \nI\u2019m wondering if I think he\u2019s not an N because he doesn\u2019t have the major abusive problem behaviors, and even of the ones he shows he\u2019s getting better. Could it be that he\u2019s in a period of self awareness and working on himself so I never saw the worst? I\u2019ve known him for 2 years and he used to have more of the N attributes, but he was also a 17 year old jock and I\u2019ve met few of those that didn\u2019t have a god complex in high school. Or maybe none of that at all and he could be getting worse?\nObviously you guys can\u2019t diagnose him, but I\u2019m wondering if there\u2019s ways of finding out like if I gave him an online N test would that give more insight, would that even be worth it in anyway? Should I talk to my SO about how I\u2019ve done a lot of reading and I don\u2019t really see it? \n\n\nTLDR: SO says he\u2019s an N but doesn\u2019t seem like it to me.

I catfished him, said I was 18 and in college, within a year I confessed my true self bc I couldn\u2019t hurt him and he kept trying to come meet me in another state. I was 13, my abusive dad had just left, my sister had just moved away to college (8hrs) and I was basically pretending to be her bc my life was HELL. I was cutting at that time to deal with the trauma and talking to multiple people on aol and by phone (all gross men) pretending to be someone else is literally the only reason I survived.  It killed me to hurt the only friend I had in the world when everyone else had abused me my whole life, it made me the abuser and I couldn\u2019t deal. He was rightfully upset but this is when the abuse started. The \u201cwell if your hot we can maybe meet up anyway\u201d .... which led to an eating disorder and SERIOUS lifelong insecurities. **Just giving y\u2019all the back story bc this attachment runs DEEP on all the levels. It\u2019s not a shallow relationship. I was indebted to him for life in my mind bc of what I did. \n\n\nOk so now, FF, this man was emotionally abusive and a narc all along I just was too young and naive to see it. He was 6yrs older and bc I had hurt him, he was almost a god to me in a weird way. I wanted to please him. He called me on and off between girlfriends, when I finally moved to NYC for college I got pregnant. So he lost interest pretty quickly. I moved with my now husband to FL. My friend disappeared digitally (remember we never met) deleted his email and changed his number. I was devastated but thought maybe I broke his heart (I always have given him human qualities) he just wasn\u2019t into me anymore. So then came MySpace and he found me, realized I\u2019m actually very attractive (I was never secure enough to send him pics bc of the way he degraded women) oh and he isn\u2019t very attractive but whatever. So then he starts messaging me all the time. I tell him I\u2019m moving back to my hometown to flip houses for a few years, he starts dating a girl from my hometown \ud83d\ude44 I\u2019m happy in my relationship and there was no plan to meet him.\n\nThe girl he started dating is his now wife. From my hometown. At this time he started calling me. Oh wait, asking me to call him, bc he needed me to be the one chasing him. \ud83d\ude44 I started calling him at night driving around. I confess I wanted to meet him before I got married, obviously. I wanted to know if the connection was real. He was only interested in hooking up and always guided the conversation to a sexual place with I was not comfortable with which led to fallout. He dropped me again. Total discard. Married his wife, IN NY HOMETOWN. Still never met him. This is when my husband found out about him and I confessed everything. He told me my friend was a bad guy and I should stay away. I wish I had listened.\n\n7yrs ago he added me on FB. He had a baby and I was so proud. I thought maybe he\u2019d grown up now. He was my best friend and I loved him, I told him congrats and accepted the FR. He messaged me shallow \u201clike\u201d and emoji messages on there that I ignored. I believed my husband was right about him and kept him away. He asked several times for me to call or txt him (still wanted me to be the chaser) I refused. In 2014 he txted me happy birthday and the next month I did the same, our friendship by txt started at that time.\n\nDaily txting. I wouldn\u2019t let him call me bc of the bad feeling I had about doing it in 2007. He was still sorta sleazy but convinced me he missed me as a friend and wanted me in his life. I mean, you talk about sex to your best friend right? Like I just still was very naive.\n\nOK THIS IS TOO LONG lol \n\nBasically the entire 5yrs was abusive AF. He is toxic, made me super insecure, always picking me apart, always taking conversations to sex, begging me for pics, ask super weird gross sex questions, bragging about cheating on his wife, bragging about his money and status. Just toxic and gross. \n\n3yrs in I finally let him start calling me again, immediately the relationship fell apart. I realized he was shallow and sleazy but my attachment to him was SO STRONG I would let him gaslight me into thinking he was in love with me. This trauma bond went on for almost two years and brings us to current time.\n\nHe got caught talking to me in October. My husband knows I talk to my friend, his wife had no idea who I even was. Now here is where he was able to gaslight her easily. The day he got caught was the day I told him I could never speak to him again. He told me he was working in his office. He told me he lost his feelings for me and still would \u201cmess around\u201d but needed time to get his feelings back bc he lost them when I got sick the year before and caught him in a lie. He screamed at me, hung up and turned off his phone. Outraged I regrettably called his office about 10x in a row. He wasn\u2019t there you guys. He was in mf MEXICO WITH HIS WIFE. That\u2019s why he hung up. Yes. So when she gets home and sees the record, it looks like I\u2019m crazy. \n\nHe didn\u2019t stop talking to me. He tried to commit suicide. It tore my heart to pieces to see him in so much pain. He cried every time we spoke. I wanted to be there for him but by December I realized and remembered why I didn\u2019t want him in my life anymore to begin with. He was a shallow and selfish narcissist. Now, part of me knew I think that he had told her I was a stalker, but it hurt so much I couldn\u2019t entertain that thought.   In January he gave me the most sincere apology I\u2019ve ever gotten from him. He knew exactly what to say. Said he loved me and needed me in his life. Said he was so sorry about how he treated me when I was so sick and owned EVERYTHING. It was the perfect apology and felt sincere to me. Regrettably, I started talking to him again.\n\nI told him many times it was ok not to talk to me anymore. I didn\u2019t want him to hurt his family. Deep down I knew that all I needed from him was that apology and I didn\u2019t want him in my life anymore. He wasn\u2019t safe. He couldn\u2019t be trusted. Every time I tried to tell him it was ok to stop talking he cried so hard. It broke me. I was the 13yr old again, breaking my best friends heart. I couldn\u2019t do it.\n\nSo the last month (March) was bad. He couldn\u2019t be the friend I needed. Same old shit. Ignoring texts, Only asking shallow questions, being a dick. I told him we couldn\u2019t speak anymore and made him get a dr appointment for his depression. He begged for a week after that to keep talking. Apologizing for everything. We finally had settled on breaking and I would let him call after he got treatment...\n\nThen that night.\nSkip ahead to this If you want!\nHe called in a drunken RAGE. Rage. Screaming. Verbally assaulted me. Purposely said things to hurt me. I had told him we couldn\u2019t talk anymore. He flipped out. Cops came to take him home bc he was outside his car at a park. I called several times in a row to see if he was ok. When he answered I made him talk to me on his way home. When he got to his house he went a wall. Like. I realize now it\u2019s bc he knew his wife was listening, but at the time, it was scary. Seriously words have never caused me so much pain. He started screaming about how I was obsessed with him and needed to move on. (I had just told him we could never talk again not 20mins prior) he started screaming I was a psycho stalker. I ruined his life. He hated me. Would never talk to me again. I should grow up. Just bizarre and awful awful things. I collapsed in the floor of my kitchen. Sobbing. He screamed he didn\u2019t want to hear me cry bc he didn\u2019t care. He hung up, I called right back. This happened 5x or so. Idk what I wanted. He wouldn\u2019t let me speak, I just wanted him to stop and take it back. I\u2019ve never been so hurt by anyone in my life. He hung up the last time. Turned off his phone. I blocked him and deleted our txts from that day. Sat in my kitchen and sobbed til 5am.\n\n\nNext day I was blocked across the board. His wife heard him scream so she just naturally believed her husband. I mean hell, I believed him. You should\u2019ve heard him. It was scary how easily he lied like that. So she supposedly was threatening to go to the police and I was powerless to tell her the truth. That was a full two, maybe 3 actually, weeks ago. \n\n\nOk\nTL;DR\n\nAFTER WEEKS of crying and begging he finally agreed to have a conversation. Not because of my pain, but bc I told him I would send her the screen shots I have proving he wanted me here and that I\u2019m not a effing stalker. He called within the hour of that. He obviously has lied to her. His apology was so cold and not at all the friend I had. I mean he\u2019s just gone, never existed. He is cold and a robot and he is getting away with this you guys. I have ptsd bc of him. The emotional abuse would be a whole other book. Trying to force me to watch him commit suicide. Dark shit. I had panic attacks every day for two weeks. Couldn\u2019t leave my house. He is out happily living and lying to everyone and I just have to tell her the truth. Not in a trashy way. Like here are your husbands dick pics. \ud83d\ude2c\nBut like in a matter of fact way. I know she knows nothing about what he did. How long he talked to me. What he wanted. How he came to meet me twice and I wouldn\u2019t do it. The girls he touched in bars. Like, I have to tell her, right?\n\nPlease help. He is gross. What would you want to know about your husband? I mean I don\u2019t have to give every detail. But if my husband was this sleazy and lying this much I would want to know. Personally. I would. He can\u2019t get away with this.

Been here literally a thousand times. It\u2019s actually much easier to deal with now that I\u2019m aware he is a narcissist. Before when I would be put in \u201ctime out\u201d I sat there pathetically wondering what I did wrong. Or how I could fix things. Of course there still are lingering thoughts and doubts. So looking for support to make it through this time around. I want to make it through strong \ud83d\udcaa Like I want to come out a better person because of it. With dignity and poise. I want to come out of it and use it as proof for myself that I am a strong woman. What advice do you all have? \n\nIf your interested in what I did to be put into time out...my husbands 17 year old daughter (who exhibits many of the same narcissistic traits as he does) was with my 11 year old daughter. My 11 year old is very shy and uncomfortable around new people. We were setting up a wedding for a friend. They went off to hang out with other teenagers. Later in the day I looked at my very withdrawn 11 year old sitting by herself at a table and asked what was wrong? She immediately bursts into tears and says she was standing next to stepsister and she yelled \u201cstop following me!\u201d She was really embarrassed. And hurt. The 17 year old has always made it very clear she does not like the 11 year old. She has outright told my husband this. My 11 year old never understood why. The 11 year old has never expressed hatred towards her. She has always been confused why she is mean to her. For years now I have tried to systematically arrange the schedule so they are never alone together because I started to become very concerned that my 11 year old kept reaching out to her big sister only to be consistently shot down. Talking to husband about any of it is a joke. So yeah just secretly arranging the schedule has been working out beautifully. Anyway, after talking to 11 year old. I approached 17 year old who was sitting with her dad. I sat down next to them. Made small talk with hubby. Then I GENTLY and KINDLY asked if she had done what 11 year old said. She says \u201cno I didn\u2019t say that! Like I was pacing around she was like standing right by me!\u201d I said ok then what did you say? \u201cI said stop following me!\u201d I said ok that isn\u2019t really a nice thing to say. For the record, I NEVER call out his daughters behavior as it has always caused problems. Of course he can call out my daughter multiple times a day and nothing is said. But as I\u2019ve started recognizing the abuse my daughter and I have been going through, I\u2019ve started to speak up more. I\u2019m never aggressive or mean about it. So this was the first time in YEARS I\u2019ve called his daughter out because I felt it was just over the top. It wasn\u2019t just this one comment. The entire time the girls are together she is making snippy antagonistic remarks to 11 year old and I stay out of it to keep the peace. She is completely dominant over the 11 year old and has been since she met her. My daughter was only 5 and really had no ability to defend herself from her older sister. So this is just the standard now. Anyway, husband says to me \u201cso what happened?\u201d Even though he\u2019s been sitting there listening intently to the whole conversation. I tell him that 17 year old yelled at 11 year old and told her to stop following her. He stands up and sarcastically says \u201coooookkkkkkaaaayyyy\u201d. He did this to make sure his daughter was aware that he was on her side. I ignored it. Half an hour later we are alone and he\u2019s all pissed off and asks why I never call out our 11 year old on her behavior. I\u2019m like when? I constantly correct her. Which I do. And so does he! Like do you have an example?  No example. I laugh and roll my eyes because this is absurd. He goes on to tell me twice that he just really doesn\u2019t give a shit anymore. Then walks off. I sit in car to take deep breaths so I can remain calm in front of him. To which I have succeed so far. He comes up to car and tells that he needs the keys. Then says unless you want to drive me to store. I tell him no, I\u2019m not interested in taking him anywhere since he doesn\u2019t give a shit about me. I walk back in building. This is the text I get:\n\nHim: I did NOT say I don\u2019t give a shit about you, I said I don\u2019t give a shit if you don\u2019t care to take anything I have to say into consideration or even hear me out. STOP putting words in my mouth!\n\nMe: Actually you said you \u201cjust don\u2019t give a shit anymore\u201d the first two times. It was vague so it was up for interpretation. \n\nHim: Not my problem how you interpret it, I followed up with a clear explanation after the first 2 statements.\n\nMe: ok. So what\u2019s the problem?\n\nAnd now I\u2019m in time out and have been for 3 days now. I continue to smile at him when I see him. Say hello. Act like nothing has happened. I\u2019m not doing it to try to get into his good graces again. I know I\u2019ve done nothing wrong. I\u2019m doing it to prove to myself that even when I have done nothing wrong, and even when I\u2019m being punished and don\u2019t retaliate, I\u2019m still treated like shit. Also, something I\u2019ve noticed about his texts is they are phrased in such a way to make him seem entirely rational. A few weeks ago after a fight where he was very obviously in the wrong, he tried to call me and argue about it. I refused to do it on the phone as every time I speak he yells over me. I sent him a very detailed,  non emotional, factual overview of what had just gone down and how it was no longer acceptable. This was his response:\n\n\u201cThanks for the info, I will take what you said into consideration and when there is a time that what I have to say will be heard and understood I will engage but as of right now it\u2019s not the time, I have explained myself a hundred times, tried to thoroughly explain them and my position, yet you still say I haven\u2019t brought any of my actual concerns up at this point I am all out of ideas and options but if I can come up with a way that I think will be beneficial to me and possibly the marriage I will let you know. \u201c\n\nSounds fair doesn\u2019t it? Rational? Sounds like he may have legitimate complaints? The problem is just 30 minutes ago he was screaming at me like a lunatic. Full on rage. NOTHING like what he just texted me. And then the whole \u201cif I can come up with a way I\u2019ll let you know\u201d That fucker called back 5 minutes later to let me know...with full rage on again. I think he knows that the texts are an ongoing record of his behavior. So he phrases them to look good in case any of this becomes public information. \n\nSorry so long. Got it all out and feel better. \n\nOne last thing- Yes I am concerned for my daughters well being by staying married to this man. I\u2019ve only come to learn he is a narcissist in the last few months. Before all this I was constantly doubting myself, wondering if it was me, maybe he\u2019s got a point when he constantly fed me word salads etc. I\u2019m just now beginning to see the abuse of both of us and I\u2019m embarrassed and ashamed that I\u2019ve allowed the abuse of my daughter. Now it\u2019s just a matter of logistics and getting set up to get out. As well as have solid proof for myself that it was him. For years I have blamed and doubted myself and it\u2019s not easy to just snap awake. But he makes it easier and easier every day.", "subreddit": "NarcissisticAbuse"}

Some of the insults are fresh on my mind.  These things were stuff I was never even insecure about,  he tried to make me insecure about everything about my appearance.  The only insecurities I had was,  acne and my stomach.  Over the years he would bring up more and more stuff to insult me about and demean me, he didn't do it all in one go,  it was a long drawn out process,  it worked.  I felt like a walking baboon. \n\nSome of  criticizes went like this,  and they were actually things I was insecure about.  When I was lying down he took his hands and stretched my stomach out to make it look flat,  he goes look how much better you could look,  if you actually exercised.  I actually agreed with him on this,  he said how he wanted me to look the best I could,  and I believed him.  He always said I had ' fat thighs\" When I said that bothered me,  he said fat is a good word.  He obsessed over my skin and make-up,  he bought me new makeup the year into the relationship,  a brand I never wore,  and a way lighter color,  he and his mother told me,  \"this color actually matches your skintone,  unlike the one you wear all the time,  it will look better\". I felt embarrassed,  I usually put fake tan and wore darker foundation to match it,  but they clearly thought it looked stupid,  I didn't like looking pale at the time,  but I felt they were trying to get me to embrace it,  and so I went along with what they wanted.  I wore the lighter foundation,  and I remember them telling me how much better I looked.  I believed them.  \n\nMy acne became this talking topic for his mother and him when I was there,  it made me extremely uncomfortable,  but I was too embarrassed to say anything.  My ex would ask his mother in front of me what I should do about my acne,  I remember thinking\" How does she know,  she never even had it\". She said how it was probably dirt from all the makeup I wore,  I felt so ashamed,  I wore makeup to hide acne scars,  so it would stop being a talking topic,  if I had them on show I felt they would act like it is an emergency situation.  My ex then over a period of years,  would criticize my makeup,  say \"why are you wearing that again\",  \" Why have you painted your face again\" \"Stop painting your face\" \"This is why you have acne\",  to \" I'm not kissing you with lip stuff on,  I hate that\",  I would have to take off any lip product,  even Vaseline for him to kiss me,  he refused to kiss me with any lip product.  It was like I was under a microscope,  and I was one huge problem he was trying to fix.  He acted like I was a bad project he needed to work on,  and he was committed,  I told him I felt that way,  and he said it was because he cared and wanted to see me happy and not hide with makeup.  I accepted his answer,  and thought the reason I felt ashamed was because of the acne,  not because of him or his mother hyper focusing on it.  One comment really upset me, he did with a smirk on his face,  he said,  \"I don't know if I'd ever actually want to have kids with you because of your sh*t skin\" It hurt deeply,  he would say things that were extra harsh like that every once in a while,  and the  say well I am being honest,  that is what I think,  I don't my kids to have acne.  \n\nThis went on for the first few years,  and I felt I needed his help, him pushing me to do stuff about my weight or acne and without it I would just go way downhill.  He would look up laser and tell me you need to get this,  it was hundreds at the time,  and I couldn't afford it,  so felt like I was letting him down.  He then started criticizing thing I never had a problem with,  he would say things like your forehead is huge,  \"I never thought that,  and nobody ever said that to me\",  he would then a few months later say \" You have a big chin\" I never once thought I had a big chin.  He would say how ugly I looked with short hair and to keep it long,  and laugh about how bad I looked with it,  and say if you still had that I could not go out with you. He said my closet looked like I was living in a funeral home,  that I needed to change it,  he got me to go out buy tons of new clothes to please him,  and I paid for them all,  he threw 10 quid at the cash register,  and the lady was like \"aw that's so nice\" I remember thinking \"wtf\",  I didn't even choose these clothes,  but feel I have no choice but to buy them to keep him happy.  I would have preferred to spend the money on other things.  Appearance was everything to him.  He was good looking,  but he believed he looked like a model and every feature of his was perfection,  that he was more beautiful than the rest,  I bought into this,  and tried to \"keep up with his mentality\". \n\n He would also compliment me,  saying things like \"your hair is so soft\",  I would feel on top of the world because he approved.  He would say you did your makeup so nice today,  I felt great because he approved.  He would say \"you've lost weight,  you need to eat more,  you can't be too skinny\" which went against what he had got into my head for years.  He would say how nice what I'm wearing is, or something.  I felt on top of the world when I felt accepted by him,  and he approved of me. It was like it was all paying off,  and I would think to myself\" I'm happier cause apparently I look better the way he wants me,  and he is happier too,  so I thought it was a win win situation\". He would make fun of other people and what they wore all the time,  this guy he was in a band with he would say to me I doubt he ever changes his clothes,  I think he smells really bad,  or how ugly some of the people he hangs out with are,  and if only they were as \"beautiful as him\". We would pass a woman on the street who had this very confident attitude and sense of style,  he would say \"why can't you be like that\" I would feel like such a failure,  because I tried so hard to be his \"perfect image\" But I just couldn't please him fully,  no matter what,  it was never good enough,  there was always something wrong,  or something I needed to work on.  He acted like he was frustrated with me,  that he had spent years trying to make me into this perfect image but I just kept falling short all the time.  Even the most simple things,  I would be wearing something with normal underwear,  and he would say,  \"oh no,  we have to buy you a thong or g string because you can see your panty lines,  it looks terrible\",  it was strange because I didn't need to buy any,  I just decided to wear the underwear I was wearing for comfort.  \n\nI always made some mistake,  if it wasn't my makeup it was my body,  if it wasn't my body it was something with my clothes,  if it wasn't my clothes it was my personality,  always something.  At the same time he acted like he was so happy to spend time with me,  and got excited to show me things,  but I needed to live up to his expectations,  or else I would be insulted for that whole day,  and I could feel that he was embarrassed to be with me.  I always did everything in my power to avoid that.  At times when I genuinely felt confident in my skin,  and would say, \"isn't this top nice? \" He would be very unaffected and say its fine,  and talk about something else.  \n\nHas anyone else had this experience?  I feel really messed up from it.", "subreddit": "NarcissisticAbuse"}

We were in an LDR. I left because I was unhappy but I never considered anything he did abusive. Since then, I've made many new friends and whenever I tell them about my ex they respond with concern and tell me that he was really messed up.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI've doubted this for so long for many reasons. The first being that we were both fairly young. We started dating when I was about 14 and he was 15. I broke it off right before I turned 18, so I thought maybe we were both just dumb kids that didn't know enough about relationships. He is also severely mentally ill (severe depression, anxiety, BPD, etc.) so I thought a lot of his actions were because of that and he shouldn't be accused of abuse. He also asked me, many many times, if I felt like he was abusing me, and of course I would say no. He often told me that people with BPD are wrongly accused of being abusers and I didn't want to add to that.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nRecently though I've been thinking about it a lot, because a lot of his actions left me with some... lasting side-effects, I guess? Like for example, he used to get really upset with me when I fell asleep while staying up late with him, so for a LONG time after leaving him I would wake up in a panic, just by association. I'm in a different (much better) relationship now, and I've found myself getting really paranoid that my boyfriend now will get upset with me like my ex did about things, but he never does. I went through a massive list of \"signs of emotional abuse\" to see how much aligned and it was... a lot. Here's just a few things, because I still don't know if this is abuse or just a bad match/relationship:\n\nBelittling my interests (until my interests aligned with his), keeping me from friends and family, guilting me, being extremely jealous of me, belittling my accomplishments, blaming me for his personal issues, accusing me of abusing him, forcing me to make sacrifices for him &amp; getting nothing in return, telling me I didn't have a personality, threatening suicide.... He also really didn't want me to go to college, and instead wanted me to move away with him. I agreed at the time, but now I think it's kind of freaky. Also, I lied to him a lot, because when I told him certain things he would get really upset so I found it easier to lie. When I broke up with him and told him this he accused me of being a horrible person and a liar (all on his public blog).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI just don't know. I doubt it because when I hear about abusive relationships, it involves more personal attacks and insults towards the abused person, but he never really did stuff like that. If he did, it was really subdued, like telling me I don't have a personality. I was also the one to break up with him, and I usually hear about abusers getting tired of their victims and leaving them instead. I don't know. This is all really scary and I don't know what to do with this information. I'm terrified to call him an abuser because he said if he found out I said anything like this he would hurt himself, or try to hurt me, I forget the specifics but it was a threat. I just want some closure I guess.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm sorry for the wall of text.

He behaved in a way that I do think was inconsiderate/hot and cold behavior but I could have handled it far better and overreacted/confronted him about it. We all know what happens when you confront an N even gently--HUGE fight. I ended things impulsively then sent a follow-up apology text a little over a week later. Haven't heard from him at all. He didn't even say anything when I ended it (it was by text), just acted like he couldn't care less and hasn't said anything to me since. Here I feel like he has the moral high ground and the power...I have lost face and probably seem \"beneath\" him to him.

Even when confronted with solid evidence they will make any excuse, rather than be held accountable. They are adept at using these tactics to avoid accountability for their actions at all costs. \n\n\nIntimidate/Blame. The narcissist begins by bullying the person endeavoring to hold them accountable. Frequently they resort to name calling and belittling to assert dominance over the other person. Once a subordinate position has been established, they blame the person for attempting to make the narcissist look less than superior.\n\nAccuse/Project. To circumvent any accountability, the narcissist preempts the attack by accusing another person. Usually they pick an overly responsible, co-dependent person who idolizes the narcissist. Then the narcissist projects the things they are answerable for onto the other person. Thus escaping before the attack.\n\nArgue/Exhaust. This is the simplest tactic with great immediate results. When confronted, the narcissist picks one small detail and argues it to the umpteenth degree. If the other person argues back, they pick another tiny point and persistently wear down their opponent. Exhausted, frustrated, and annoyed, the other person gives up holding the narcissist liable.\n\nDeny/Rewrite. One way of avoiding responsibility is for the narcissist to deny they have any. Even if the item is written down, the narcissist will make excuses and rewrite history. Frequently they take the victim role by saying they were forced into being held accountable when in actuality they willingly did so. This tactic often leaves the other person questioning themselves and their memory.\n\nDivert/Attack. This method begins with an outburst over something very insignificant. Then, the narcissist exaggerates the point to incite the other person and draw their attention away from what really is happening. Whenever the narcissist is fueling a small fire, it is to keep the focus off the inferno somewhere else. The diversion is done to drain resources, energy, and time so the narcissist can attack when the other person is vulnerable.\n\nFear/Avoid. Narcissists have the ability to take a person\u2019s small fear and turn it into paranoia. Their charisma is put to destructive uses as they weave a believable story with an intense dreadful outcome. Once the other person is frightened, the narcissist uses the other person\u2019s terror as justification for avoiding responsibility. They often cite that the other person is reactionary and therefore any requests from the other person should be discounted.\n\nRescue/Retreat. This tactic is the most manipulative of bunch. First the narcissist rescues the other person from a dreadful situation. Having gained the other person\u2019s loyalty, the narcissist waits. Eventually the other person confronts the narcissist about a lack of responsibility and then the narcissist retreats. The withholding of love/attention/time is so dramatic that the other person becomes horrified and assumes responsibility so that the narcissist will return. Once secured, the narcissist then accuses the other person of not appreciating the rescue. The other person feels bad and succumbs to the wishes of the narcissist even further.", "subreddit": "NarcissisticAbuse"}

We talked about going shopping together to find things that could help us express our bisexuality. I was especially excited because I never really felt like he was interested in my bisexuality, so I was looking forward to us supporting each other. He seemed a bit uncomfortable when I shared that I felt like I had to heighten my femininity to make up for my sexuality. Maybe he couldn't handle hearing about my sexuality. But he agreed to go shopping together to start experimenting with our clothes. It would be our coming out clothes. And then he went and did it on his own. On our anniversary.

Since we're already revamping the playlist, is it reasonable for me to request a change in music?", "subreddit": "NarcissisticAbuse"}

And why can't I leave?", "author": "throwawayyyy999000", "self_text": "We've been together about 2,5 years this time around (also 1,5 years in the past). While we were living long-distance a few months I suddenly realized I felt more free and happier without him around, and that I'd been censoring myself and adjusting myself to his preferences. I told him so and tried to break up with him over FaceTime several times. He insisted that we wait to see each other in person and try to work it out. I agreed.\n\nWhile he was away I read up on narcissism and gaslighting and I recognize a lot of it in his behavior. But I'm not sure.\n\nNow he's been back in my country about 6 weeks. He's been giving me space. We see each other 1-2 times a week. He's been very sweet, compliments me a lot, goes to the market for me, does dishes etc. We've had talks and fights. He has apologized to me several times. But he's also said things like:\n* we shouldn't spend so much time talking/thinking about things in the abstract, rather just try to reconnect. Also I overthink things and keep wanting to talk about the same stuff\n* he still doesn't see the problem (says this when things get tense/emotional)\n* I never communicated my boundaries/issues with him until now, so we don't know how things might've been different (for the record I HAVE spoken up on specific occasions but not followed through or been forceful about it)\n\nThis past weekend we had a long talk/fight over the phone where I really opened up on how his behaviour had shaped me. I told him that he doesn't want ME, but the person we created together and that person doesn't exist. When he put the blame solely on me (it's my fault I'm two-faced) it just poured out of me. How I had been young and weak &amp; just wanted his time/love and he had told me so many times that he just knew how he liked things and he wanted things that way and I could take it or leave it. That he'd also shown me this by yelling at me, insulting me, withholding attention and eventually leaving me for someone else (5 yrs ago). In the end he said I was right, it had been a dynamic between the two of us, and his treatment of me was wrong. He apologized.\n\nI am still angry and annoyed at him all the time, but will push it down and try to give him a chance and reconnect. Still the best I can muster is detachment/contentedness.\n\nI started breaking up with him again the day after that talk, but in the end took it back again (2-3 times in the past 6 weeks). He will ask me why I want to break up and beg me to give him another chance and promise me things will work out and I crumble. I am normally a very decisive person, but I just can't pull the trigger. Especially now that he does seem to be trying. I wonder if I should give him a chance and maybe he can change. I'm so confused.\n\nTLDR; SO might be a narc but might not be. I have not set proper boundaries in the past. I keep feeling like I want to leave but end up giving him another chance.", "subreddit": "NarcissisticAbuse"}

We talked for just around three months but in that time he did a lot of flirting and led me on to believe I should leave my family and consider moving to Canada with him (I am from the States). I don\u2019t want to get into the details, but basically we had a falling out in our communication because he would continuously give me the silent treatment and he was emotionally abusive to me and his current roommate at the time (who I eventually dated). \n\nI blocked him on all accounts without him knowing because I couldn\u2019t handle it anymore and he lashed out and said he didn\u2019t need me in his life anymore and went on to say I betrayed him when in reality I saw him for who he really was. \n\nIt had been about a year of no contact established when on New Years he contacted me through a side account trying to apologize for the things he did and basically trying to guilt me on for all the hardships he dealt with from losing me. He said he wouldn\u2019t be friends with me so long as I was dating his ex roommate (they had a massive falling out because he also couldn\u2019t deal with all the bs). \nI told him I was uncomfortable and that he made a mistake to reach out. I regret my decision of replying at all. \n\nMaybe a month later, I find out he is accusing me of cyberstalking and that I was obsessed with him and attempted libel against him simply for pointing out how wrong it was for him to try telling me to move out with him when I was that young and our age difference was not okay. \nHe claims he has been seeing a lawyer to try and do something about me but I have done nothing illegal or wrong when he is the one guilty for everything he accuses me of. \n\nIt\u2019s made me miserable and fearful. He claims to track my IP from the few times I looked back on his (public) account and that he also knows where I work. \n\nI keep telling myself that even if a cease and desist order comes my way, all I have to do is remain silent and avoid logging on to my social media. But it\u2019s just not fair because I can\u2019t even interact with my friends online out of fear he will take things personal because we share similar friend groups.\n\nI\u2019m a junior in college and don\u2019t have the finances to deal with this if something big does come my way. It\u2019s been emotional whiplash, dealing with him. One moment he\u2019s sorry he lost me and saying I was the only person who understood him and the next he\u2019s calling me a stalker and that I was obsessed with him... \n\nI wish none of this was real. I tell myself that I am okay and safe and that it could all just be a bluff but even if he does try something, the law is on my side. But it\u2019s triggering having to confront these emotions again and think about everything wrong he has ever done and gather evidence in case I need a defense. \n\nI\u2019m not really sure what the goal of sharing this is, besides just having a place to get it out.

He was incredibly charismatic and women threw themselves at him. He estimate that he\u2019s slept with between 150 and 200 women. He would complain if only he could find ~one~ woman who didn\u2019t want to have sex with him. I felt proud somehow that I wasn\u2019t swayed by his charms. He said he was tired of constant casual hookups and wanted something real. I rebuffed his advances but he persisted, buying me things, saying his friends thought we should get together, saying we were practically dating except that I wouldn\u2019t sleep with him.\n\nEventually I gave in. The relationship moved very quickly. Within the first two weeks he told me he thought I was just right for him, I made everything magical, he would propose to me by Christmas, he couldn\u2019t believe that I was with him. He wanted to be a better person for me. I\u2019m an ethical vegan so he started eating vegan, saying he felt bad for the animals(I knew he was doing it to lose weight). He took me to his favorite bar, saying he\u2019d never taken a woman there before because he didn\u2019t want to ruin it for himself if they broke up. We moved in together after three weeks; he said it had nothing to do with our relationship, it was just closer to work for both of us and I was going to have to leave my then-current apartment soon anyway.\n\nTwo times he got me drunk and invited his friend over for a three way. I expressed discomfort after both times and told him that I felt a bit traumatized since I hadn\u2019t been in a frame of mind to consent. He said he just wanted to be able to sleep with other people without feeling like he was cheating but he wouldn\u2019t do it again. I was made to feel guilty, like I was holding him back. The third time he invited someone from Grindr over and I didn\u2019t have the willpower to say no.\n\n\nHe had a serious drinking problem, at one point after a five and a half hour binge threatening in detail to beat two men to death at the bar and then doing push-ups until we got kicked out. \n\nRight after that he quit drinking(the third three way was after he quit). This was a couple months into the relationship. He began to criticize me, saying he wished my breasts were bigger and wanting to have a three way with a girl with bigger tits, saying I didn\u2019t wear enough makeup, saying I should wear more revealing clothes. If we were having an argument and I brought up evidence he would shut down and say I wasn\u2019t letting him have an opinion. He said I was messy and he stopped letting me do his laundry because I would fuck it up. He woke up every morning in a terrible mood, saying horrible things, but he wouldn\u2019t remember anything he said later in the day.\n\nI became constantly insecure and worried that he would leave me. I would bring it up out of fear so that he would reassure me. He would text his ex(who lives out of state) constantly and would call me jealous if I mentioned it.\n\n\nHe would constantly make promises and not keep them, even small ones. When he drank he would say he\u2019d be home from the bar in ten minutes then still not be home two hours later. He would offer to do the dishes then leave them for days. He obviously didn\u2019t propose to me. He said I would always be his best friend and I could stay even if we broke up but when we did he made me leave. His brother moved in with us in January, and when we discussed it before he told me it would just be until he got on his feet but as soon as he moved in it became a permanent arrangement. After we broke up he said that whether friends or together we would always have each other, but after a little bit if I turned to him he became quickly annoyed and began avoiding me. He said he wouldn\u2019t be dating anyone else for a long time but a week later started dating a new girl, telling me he\u2019d never felt this way about anyone before.\n\nI broke up with him but I immediately regretted it. I cried constantly and begged him to take me back. He was nice at first, holding me, buying me food, but he quickly got tired of it and told me I needed to toughen up.\n\n\nHe said that at the beginning he drank so much so that he wouldn\u2019t have to think about how incompatible we were. He said that if I was with him I wouldn\u2019t be able to be myself. He said that the relationship was toxic. This is what makes me question everything. Was the lovebombing just a result of desperation? Would a narcissist acknowledge that a relationship was toxic and he wanted me to be able to be myself?\n\nA couple weeks after I moved out he invited me over to hang out. When I came he began holding me. I told him I didn\u2019t want to fuck around. He said he understood, he just missed having me there. Eventually we had sex. We hooked up a few times after that, and the sex was much rougher than when we were dating. He began to contact me less, and I became worried and asked for an explanation, he would say nothing was wrong and then the contact would become less frequent, and the cycle would repeat. It got to a point that I was suicidal(I\u2019ve been hit with a bout of depression that started around February). I told him how I felt and he said to give it a couple days. A couple days later I texted him, asking him to call because I need someone to talk to. He didn\u2019t reply, so I called him;still no reply. I didn\u2019t feel safe being alone so I went to the apartment and asked him to be there for me like he told me he would. He told me I was crazy and he was considering getting a restraining order. \n\nI called the suicide prevention lifeline on the way home and calmed down. I figured that was the last I\u2019d see him. Two days later he texted me good morning, and that night he invited me over. The sex was even rougher than before and he made me say that I was his slave. He asked me when I found someone if I would cheat on them with him. I asked him the same and he said hell yeah. \n\nThat was a week ago. I texted him the next day and the day after and he replied but he hasn\u2019t texted me since. \n\nI don\u2019t know if he\u2019s a narcissist because a lot of the behaviors could have other explanations. I don\u2019t know if his behavior is just a reaction to me being clingy. I don\u2019t know if he got with me because he was desperate and in a bad place and once he got to a better place and I didn\u2019t he dropped me because of that.", "subreddit": "NarcissisticAbuse"}

I don\u2019t remember saying I love you or she loved me. Ever. \n\nFirst abuse I remember us being sat in a bathtub as my mother washed me. I can say therefore I was probably too young to bathe myself. \n\nI looked down at my legs and they were spotted like a cheetah with bruises.  I told my mum look, at the bruises. She said shut up before I receive more. \n\nParents divorced when I was 9. \nBefore this constant arguments and abuse between them. Both ways. One time I hid on the stairs whilst they argued. \nI peered over and my mum was clutching her stomach and crying. \nDad told me to get back upstairs. \n\nI had nightmare at a similar time that depicted my dad as a solider, who gutted my mum out like a dead animal. \n\nAfter divorce my dad moved out. Worryingly I was not phased by him moving out, I had no emotional reaction to this at all. \n\nThis was a time of depression for my mum and very hard Financial Times. Her wage only covered the rent and she had to work somewhere additionally at night to afford anything else. \n\nMy mum was most abusive from this time until she kicked me out. \n\nAnytime I argued with my sibling I usually got blamed and then beaten. Not hitting, but punching. Hair ripping and pulling. \nShe would always aim for the body so no bruises were visible. \nHer eyes would go very wide, almost demon like. \nI never knew when the next bad mood would be, or the next beating. Every time they happened I would be ignored for a while after. \n\nTo me abusing a child is the most low thing you can do. \n\nYou know the child cannot defend itself and also cannot sustain its self. \nMeaning no escape at all. \n\nFrom the age of around 21-present I have suffered increasing paranoia, suicidal thoughts and detachment from reality. \n\nParanoia from any and all social groups (work/friends/doctors) that they all secretly don\u2019t like me and/or conspire against me. The only person who does not attract these thoughts is my current partner. \n\nAlso paranoia in illnesses. I constantly think I am going to contract a deadly disease or have one. And that I will die from this. I also have severe emetephobia that often keeps me up at night. \n\nSuicidal thoughts such as obviously a want to die, to severe strong urges to stab myself in the chest with a long thick knife. I can describe the knife because with these urges comes a vision of what and how I will do it. The vision is always the same and sometimes provides relief to the internal pain. \n\nDetachment from reality is the usual thoughts i receive that we are all here temporarily and therefore there is no need to do anything significant in this life if I am to die anyway. \nI lack motivation for most things and have to force myself to work. I view other people as sheep and pawns and as if they are not aware of the bigger picture (bigger picture being we are all enslaved in labour really. If you don\u2019t work you dont survive)\n\nI am envious of people who don\u2019t have these thoughts and can live day to day without thinking of life this critically and cynically. \n\nIf anyone has any thoughts or works please comment.

Told me I was his soulmate, a goddess, all the usual.....\n* Described history of crazy exes that \"fucked him up\" and I was so much better than.... only for me to later discover that he was still in contact with them on and off. Told me he sent them nudes to get him back.\n* He gave me three STDs the one and only time we met. He lied about this and mixed up his stories SO MUCH that I just gave up even trying to work out where/when he even got them, promised me it wasn't in the two years we were talking\n* Constantly turned all of my worries/doubts around on me, telling me I was awful, argumentative, dramatic and abusive every time I tried to discuss his shady behaviour. This escalated to the point where he didn't even try and reassure me, just threatened to leave every time I was vaguely negative\n* Silent treatment. Particularly the first few times he broke up with me - he would ignore my frantic and obsessive attempts at messaging him (although he wouldn't block)\n* Used dating apps because he needed to \"boost his ego\"\n* Lied, constantly. About everything. I don't even know the extent but I know there were a lot of lies.\n* Contact with his ex - the one that supposedly broke his heart. Told me he still had feelings for her and was in constant contact with her, would not stop this contact despite me telling him how much it upset me.

Oh, and this friend had a crush on him.\n* Refused to change his facebook status from single despite us being together for years.\n* Met other girls on nights out while blocking his phone, and subsequently lied to me about it. He would tell me these girls always wanted him and were trying to hit on him, but he was always the one all over their social media.\n* Completely hid me from everything and everyone in his life - however he blamed me for this. He said I was too much drama and too crazy so he was too embarrassed to even tell his friends or family about me.\n* Telling me that I trapped him in the relationship and needed to prove myself to him (by staying quiet) bu not creating any arguments etc. Telling me he lost feelings and wasn't sure about me and that he felt he couldn't leave even though he had very easily left so many times in the past with absolutely no repercussions.\n* Telling me I had to \"prove myself\" that I could be good, that he needed time to think about whether I could change.... and if I proved myself maybe he'd be willing to work things out\n* Dumped me end of January just two days after I was meant to visit him in his country (I lost my passport...) saying he didn't think it was worth the wait to see me again because I was too \"demanding\". Even when I begged and pleaded that i wouldn't be, saying he had nothing for me\n* Rejecting me a lot after this but with some confusing mixed signals, and then eventually when I begged for him back telling  me he still wanted me and having phone sex with me. I apparently ruined this though, \"ruined my chance\" by questioning him about a girl on his social media that I was worried about. THREE DAYS LATER he was facebook official in a relationship with this girl. THREE DAYS. He told me it was because I made him \"want to move on\" and proved how awful I was\n* Telling me how easy it was to completely forget about me after dumping me. This was after telling me so many times that he just needed to get away from me, that it would take months or even years to get over it because I fucked him over so badly that i made him want to crawl into a hole.\n* Constantly felt that girls wanted him. Always looking at other girls on social media and admitting to me that he found them hot, when he didn't want to look at me because I was too much of a turn off with the way I was acting.\n* Compared me to others. First telling me his exes were straight up crazy/sociopaths and I was the nicest person he'd met. At the end telling me they were at least reasonable and just the odd problem whereas I was ALWAYS bringing him \"lowkey shit\" and ruining his mood.\n* Discarded me as punishment for not acting right. He threatened leaving me A LOT and I was in a constant state of desperation even though I got very, very little 'good times'. He told me this was on me though, and the way I was acting. He seemed to cool off a lot.\n* Managed to \"keep me quiet\" a lot.... I have a suspicion he was talking to others during this time. He definitely did EVERY discard.\n* Every time he wanted to go out for the weekend/home etc he'd just tell me to not message him for all that time.\n* Contact time got less and less...... used to have almost daily phone calls. By the last few cycles it was the odd text, not even every day. He told me I wasn't to expect anything from him given that I was the one that had gone back to him, so I just had to do as he wanted?\n* Appeared to follow the idealise -&gt; devalue -&gt; discard, until there was basically no idealising and just mostly silence and then discard. This was because I would question him about stuff I was uncomfortable with though, so he said I kind of triggered it.\n* Apparently everyone he knows in real life thinks he's amazing.... he helps out so many people with their problems (except he \"can't relate\" with mine so he wouldn't), they all think he's loyal and amazing and would never \"see him the way I do\". He's pretty popular on social media and seemed to hang out with people a lot, different friendship groups\n* My life has been completely derailed and I have suffered so many devastating effects from the whole thing - physically and mentally. Meanwhile he seems to be better than ever.... as he liked telling me\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHe's bad... right? He seems to fit the boxes?\n\nBut I too was bad.... I think I got a lot better as time went on and more \"compliant\", most of the issues were relating\n\n* I did become jealous and needy, feeling desperately insecure when I found out he was still in contact with exes and meeting other girls etc. He would never do anything about it - just told me I should leave if I was so insecure\n* I obsessively called and texted during the first few discards despite getting no response. I would call hundreds of times with no reply. It was crazy.\n* I just could not \"chill out\" - I was very anxious and unsettled all the time and could not help myself but ask him about things, question him about things. I was often passive aggressive and argumentative and anxious and insecure. He absolutely hated it and felt he didn't need to answer to it.\n* I social media stalked - well as much as I could. He soon blocked me from absolutely everything - told me I scared him. To be fair, one time I went absolutely mental after a ?discard and started replying to comments of his on a friend's page to get his attention. Have never stooped that low since.\n* Because I read about narcissism etc so early, when I started noticing patterns I would outright accuse him of faking his feelings, devaluing me, talking to others girls, etc. It really wasn't very nice of me.

He's over the top kind to me one week, then dismissive and like he's seething with hatred or resentment towards my existence the next week. He's not usually outright cruel or anything, but during his off days or bad weeks he makes me feel like a burden, like I've been split black. Like any small inconvenience that he's blowing out of proportion was somehow caused by me. He does it to other employees to a lessor extent, but he also has a golden child who he never treats this way. I don't like being treated this way and it makes me nervous to come into work after a string of too many Good Days because I know that a crash is coming and that he's going to aim his negative energy at me. \n\nI don't know how I ended up the scapegoat at this job, I probably didn't properly massage his ego when I first started here 10 months ago. I've had one other narc boss who hated me for no reason, almost 20 years ago, and the only solution I could find then was to quit. This boss never has a real complaint about my work performance, it's just a \"I hate your face\" vibe that I get from him. It feels like an abusive relationship where his good moods are enough to make me think that things will be okay, and so I don't take any action towards leaving. Definitely the cycle of abuse. \n\nToday at work he was extra super nice because he knows that he flew off the handle yesterday. He even edited the aggressive message he wrote me yesterday evening on our work communication software before I came in today, but I already saw it yesterday because the alerts go to my phone. The message was super triggering (not due to content but because I could FEEL his rage by how he wrote it). Today he did the thing where he knows he crossed the line with anger and wanted to make sure I'm not mad at him. He came into my office and shut the door behind him, being all chummy and jokey. I calmly joked back, even though last night after getting his message I was crying and devastated because he had done it AGAIN. I could see him studying my face for signs of anger/fear/mistrust. I gray-rocked soooooo hard. He asked me pointedly during our conversation if there was anything I wanted to talk about and I said no. \n\nHe could be borderline or a narcissist, I\u2019m not sure.

That If I trust him everything was fine.  He thought cheating was only if he had intercourse with someone,  he wouldn't listen to my reasoning,  and called it bs if I corrected him. \n\nAlso criticizing things about me, because he could. Saying my personality is like a 15 year old girl,  that I need to behave like a woman,  because it's embarrassing,  how my voice sounds so dumb when I talk,  mimicking me,  mocking me,  picking things out in my appearance that he couldn't deal with,  and it goes on.  \n\nThere was also the very playful child like side to him,  where he would put on a baby voice and act really cute and harmless, and just wanting loads of attention.  I remember I would tickle him,  it was all fun until he said he would punch me if I did it again,  and full on punched me in the arm with full force when I touched him so lightly,  I would try to tell him it was wrong,  and he said listen to your man when he warns you.  \n\nThere was the serious side where he would act like he was more intelligent than everyone else,  that is why I had to listen to him above everyone,  He would sit down and do chemical equations for hours,  and talk about it with me,  when I had no clue,  not caring that I wasn't interested.  For a while he took on a role as a teacher to me, to make me \"smarter\". \n\nThere was the side to him where he would be 2 faced talking about people including his mother behind their backs,  really nasty stuff he said as well. He would say things like his mother reminded him of a giant whale on the bed,  or laugh about how ugly he thought his friend was.  Act completely natural to their face.  It was crazy.\n\nThere was the completely silent punishment side of him,  where he refused to speak to me unless I apologized,  it could have been over an opinion he didn't like, something completely normal to say, ' I don't like how you treat that person\"  anything that \"hurt his feelings\" Resulted in silent treatments,  where I always had to be the bigger person and apologize for expressing my feelings.   \n\n The petulant child side,  where he would shake you awake at 2am,  when you are exhausted and have to wake up early just so you can make him toast,  he would whine like a baby,  until you did it.  Or if he lost something and needed to find it,  he would put all the lights on in the room,  at 3am while your asleep,  force you awake to help him, he would say you would if you cared.  He guilt tripped a lot,  always had to prove you cared by doing something you didn't want to,  or when it wasn't necessary.\n\nThe extremely competitive side to him,  where he had to win at all costs, at any thing or else would say how the other person cheated, or get extremely envious and hateful about it.  \n\nThere was the manipulative,  lying side of him,  just for the thrill. Years into the relationship he said he cant believe how insensitive I am to the fact he is a drug addict.  I said no your not,  he was adamant he was,  (he smoked weed every now and then socially, he never was addicted) he said how I don't try and help him stop,  that this should be my main focus now,  to help this fake addiction he made up!  \n\n\nThe weird thing is I spent so much time with him,  and saw all these sides of him,  yet I don't know him if that makes sense? I don't know what he stands for,  what his value system is, what he truly believes, what is under all these different sides, who he is deep down? Which one of these were real and which ones weren't?

After nearly 4 years of dating he recently decided to end the relationship without talking to me about making an effort to resolve the issues he was concerned about. He has done this 4 times now, and I had taken him back every time because he displayed characteristics of change each time and a genuine want to make our relationship work (dumb of me I know.)\n\nSome background on myself: I am a university graduate moving on to complete my masters, a fit person (one of my three jobs is working for the gym), I take great pride in how I present myself to the world, and I am a natural nurturer to my loved ones be it providing hot meals or comfort in tough times etc.(sometimes to my detriment.) I have an OK relationship with my family, although some big issues with my mother.\n\nSome background on him: He is a highschool graduate that completed some college, he has had several jobs in the last 4 years (none of them lasted more than a few months) however is still unsure about a definite career path and how to get there, also a gym employee who takes great pride in the way he looks, more than most people. He has a bad relationship with his parents, especially his mother.\n\nStarting from the beginning everything was great for the first year and a half I'd say, we both still maintained friendships, went on dates, spent good quality time together, always maintained a healthy active sex life. It's worth mentioning that he is the first man I had ever had sex with. He was working at the gym at the time as a receptionist as well as an instructor and around the year and a half mark decided it was time to move forward and he had my support. He moved to a brand new gym opening up and became a sales person for a while and our relationship really took a hit due to his schedule. It was 12 hour days at times due to how busy the area was and we saw each other a lot less, and when we did he was exhausted. He then switched over to that gym as an instructor as well as a sales person. Along with the new gym came new women surrounding him. He loves the attention and at the time I had no fear it would be as big of an issue as it became. He was also a person who enjoyed social dance events and I was not yet comfortable with the idea of being so close to anyone but my partner so social dancing for a little while for him was just with me until I was ready and he seemed to understand. One day he began acting strange and while I was out to dinner with a girlfriend he said he was not feeling well and I told him to rest up and I would check on him in the morning although I had a sinking feeling that night. The next time we saw each other a text popped up on his phone from a woman saying that her other female friend had left her phone in his car the night he said he was sick and going to sleep. That was the first of many issues that came up. He insisted nothing happened other than that they went to a dance social and he met them at the gym. I was furious that he would do something like that behind my back especially with women I don't know. He promised he would not be dishonest again and I decided to forgive and move on. After this point he began to become desolate due to his job situation so he quit his sales job and started job hopping for about a year. He always spoke about wanting these expensive cars and houses, designer clothes etc... without actually getting up and doing something practical to get them. He even went so far as to start up a \"fashion Instagram\" in hopes that a brand would sponsor him and he'd become an Influencer at some point after posting photos of himself posed in his expensive clothing. This quickly became a way for him to solicit female attention of course (someone told me in passing that it may not have ever been about his \"love of fashion\" but just the rush that someone like him would get from receiving likes and attention). During that year he became frustrated with the mundane turn he felt his life was taking and wanted to go dancing again but made a point to tell me he wanted to go without me because he wanted to dance with multiple people without me feeling left out (even though if I had gone, I would have also been dancing with other people. I suspect he didn't like seeing other men so close to me). Although I had some concerns due to the previous incident, he pressed me further and in my mind, if I couldn't trust him to handle himself appropriately then I suppose I wasn't with the right person right? So I told him it was okay with me as long as he didn't forget me and my feelings. After a couple weeks he said one Friday night that he would be going dancing, and I asked if I could accompany him that night, and he said no. This was when I got this same sinking feeling as before. This dance social was recommended by another woman at the gym, however this was one that I trusted and was respectful. She remained innocent in all of this. The following week I attended his class and had a conversation with her about it while he was changing and she mentioned that the people there were also people from the gym, something he failed to mention. When I asked him why he didn't tell me he blew up and broke up with me the first time. I was heartbroken and didn't know what to do or why he would do any of that in the first place. I remained supportive and loyal through his job hopping and uncertainty about his future and could not understand what I had done other than ask what was happening. About 4 days later he called me at around 1AM saying he was sorry and that he made a huge mistake going out with them, as well as for hurting me with his impulsive choices and lies. I said I wasn't sure, and then a few days later after talking to some people I said I would yet again give him another chance. (DUMB I KNOW.)\n\nAfter about four months going well, he had done it again. He disappeared for an entire night without a trace, wouldn't answer my texts or calls and I began to worry that something terrible had happened to him and stayed up all night because I hadn't heard anything even by 6AM. He responded to me the next morning furious that I had blown up his phone out of concern for his safety. He said he was out at the shops getting toiletries and was then updating his phone and that's why he couldn't contact me. An obvious lie because if it was updating, my calls would not have gone through. A few weeks later at a party his phone received an update notice and I said \"didn't you already update?\" and he slipped up and said \"no, you know I never update my phone\". Before he could get the last word out he realized he told on himself. He was out with women from dancing again. He insisted we leave the party early because he was embarrassed and we then discussed breaking up once again. I decided to not let his lying ruin my fun and drove myself back to the party even if I was in tears. I expressed doubt in the future of our relationship to him because I held some resentment towards him, he was seemingly understanding and we spoke about separating. After some discussion we decided the separation was not necessary but I admitted I still felt as if he was being dishonest with me about something. He then admitted that not even 24 hours after we broke up the first time, he had met up with a woman from dancing and made out with her and he was with her and her friends that night he disappeared. He told me she was well aware that he had a girlfriend and still did it anyways. He had felt so guilty he called me to get back together because he said it wasn't what he really wanted. He was just hurt. He expressed how disappointed he was in his own life, that his own friends were too busy these days and he wasn't going out with the intention of being with other women, but with the intention of making more friends because he wasn't feeling fulfilled in that way. I was yet again devastated and began to distance myself because of the hurt that I was now feeling. Whats crazy is that I had never felt more love from him than in that time period. He would call, and text and tell me sweet nothings like never before because he wanted me back. He even revealed some deep personal information I didn't know about him in his attempt to change my perception of him. I forgave him on the condition that dancing was now off the table. He agreed and I moved forward with this hurt in my heart. He made improvements here and there, he gained a steady job, started being more affectionate and loving for longer periods of time. Things got better until around November and he disappeared once again. This time he just responded with a \u201cgoodnight\u201d and didn\u2019t tell me where he was or who he was with so naturally I worried again. I was with a friend that night who was consoling me and telling me not to give up hope so I let it be. The next day he told me that he had been bar hopping with two male co workers (which would not have been an issue had he just let me know). The kicker was that he picked them up at our company Christmas party that he insisted I didn\u2019t go to, even though I had expressed that I wanted to. He then told me that he had RSVP\u2019d the two of us as a surprise for me, but then decided to do what he did instead. I was disappointed. He said he needed to find new friends yet again and was feeling down about not having his current ones making effort in their relationship. I chose not to attend the Christmas party on my own due to one of my own co workers being there who I knew was romantically interested in me. I thought it would be disrespectful to him to attend knowing he would be there looking for me.\n\nFast forward to December, one of his family members had passed away. It was his first experience with loss ever and I was there to support him any way he needed. He again brought up the idea of breaking up because he was feeling a whirlwind of emotions from losing a loved one. He quickly changed his mind on that and I was understanding for the reason of his loss.\n\nIn January he joined a soccer league and was enjoying playing, I was happy he found an outlet outside of the gym. I attended his games, was his cheerleader. He was significantly more affectionate and loving and spoke freely about his love for me, no containment. February comes around and we go on a great date for valentine\u2019s day. About 2 weeks later, he\u2019s acting distant and cold and decided to break up with me again. I begged and pleaded and asked why this was happening because from my perspective we were both finally happy with the state of our lives. Again he came back about two days later saying he wanted to make it work but kept going back and forth on what he was feeling. He admitted to me that he felt he was a victim of Child Emotional Neglect (I wasn\u2019t there during his childhood nor do I know anything beyond the family dynamic I\u2019ve heard from him and his father. I can\u2019t say for sure whether this is true or not). I suggested therapy and he refused. I told him he had till the end of the week to see me in person to discuss anything else, no more texts and he chose not to. I stopped responding to his messages and the next day he decided to actually set something up. We spoke in person about 2 weeks post breakup due to both of our busy schedules and he said he felt like he was making all of these changed to accommodate me, but I hadn\u2019t made any to suit him, I was too emotional and he did not want me to always talk to him when I was feeling blue. We agreed we both wanted to make it work. We had a date a week later, nothing fancy, just movies at home and takeout. He again came at me with all of this insane love and affection. He told me he loved me. A day later he said he no longer wanted me to come to his classes at the gym. He was protecting the feelings of another woman there who has not only been disrespectful to me, but also to the other female friends he has in his life whom he claims to cherish (this female friend is the equivalent to a mother in his eyes). He refused to believe this woman would do such a thing and stated that I needed to get over my insecurity (this woman is married and no competition to me). I was never insecure about myself, but after experiences with him such as the above, I have found that he doesn\u2019t make amazing choices when making friends. He chooses the ones that are disrespectful towards me, or towards the fact that he is in a relationship. I offered a compromise. He could not tell me where I could and could not go because that was unfair to me, but I wouldn\u2019t step in on his space if he was still feeling uncomfortable. I said we could set a number of weeks that I would give him his space and then I would be free to return if I so feel. He agreed and said he thought it was a good idea. Things returned to normal, although a little quieter. He then disappeared overnight once more saying the following morning that he had seen my worried calls and messages and decided he would just handle it in the morning, he had fallen asleep that night supposedly although I could see that he was online and had checked my messages. He then came to me saying he had come to term with his emotional neglect as a child overnight, and that this relationship wasn\u2019t what he wanted anymore. I\u2019m left here now sitting with my choices to give him chance after chance to hurt me, giving him things that mattered so much to me like my virginity, and wondering how to move forward from this experience.\n\nHe always spoke about wanting these expensive cars and houses, designer clothes etc. He even went so far as to start up a \"fashion Instagram\" in hopes that a brand would sponsor him at some point after posting photos of himself posed in his expensive clothing. This quickly became a way for him to solicit female attention of course. Someone told me in passing that it may not have ever been about his \"love of fashion\" but just the rush that someone like him would get from receiving likes and attention.\n\nAfter this most recent breakup the most unlikely person came to my side to comfort me, his father. He was there for me in the most amazing way. He told me about my ex\u2019s childhood and upbringing that I didn\u2019t know and that I\u2019m sure he doesn\u2019t even know and it helped me understand his behaviors a little more. He told me that my ex was not ready for a relationship of the caliber we were reaching due to his own position in life. Unsure of career focus, emotionally unstable etc. and that I deserved better than him. He felt as though my successes were likely highlighting his sons shortcomings in his own mind, although I never bragged or made him feel badly for being at the point in life that he was at. For a father to say that about his son made me feel horrible, for myself but also for his father. He had always had a horrible relationship with his parents, especially his mother. They live in the same house and don\u2019t even speak and because my mother and I are not on amazing terms either I didn\u2019t see it as a red flag. His father has done nothing but try to help him in any way he can over the last 4 years as far as I can see in terms of helping him try to get into school to finish any program, setting him up with opportunities to work with him long term, trying to have honest conversations with him about his life and so much more. He could not see that his father had nothing but love to offer him. Similar support from his other friends and family have come about as well, they are in agreement that he has severe issues he needs to deal with.\n\nI am now left confused with what to do with myself. My feelings are obviously hurt, I\u2019m very much craving that missing love that i thought was really there, and I am disappointed that I am now losing the lifestyle surrounding this relationship (friends, family members I care about). \n\nTL;DR My now ex boyfriend was a chronic liar, emotionally unstable, and projected his issues onto me. Despite all of this, I am still not happy with the break up. Was he a narcissist or just a jerk? How do I even begin to move forward from this?\n\nThank you to anyone who got to the end of this novel!\n*Note: This was also posted in r/redpillwomen if it looks familiar", "subreddit": "NarcissisticAbuse"}

Do I warn her?", "author": "elastic_mind", "self_text": "CW: descriptions of love-bombing, mentions of violence. \n\n\nA bit of background info about me: \n\nI am a 26 year old woman living in the UK. I want to be clear that I have my own fair share of baggage/issues. I have suffered with depression since I was a teen. I am also a codependent and have a tendency to try to \u2018fix\u2019 people around me, probably as a distraction instead of having to focus on fixing myself. \nTwo years ago, at the time my relationship with my nex started, I was in the grips of a nervous breakdown after being dismissed from my university course due to my depression. I had racked up huge credit card debt (which I couldn\u2019t pay back) in order to continue living at university as my loan was suddenly withdrawn. I was subsequently forced to move back home in to a toxic environment due to my father being an alcoholic. Needless to say, I was in an incredibly vulnerable state.\n\n\nA bit (OK, a lot) of background info on the relationship: \n\nI grew up with him. Our mothers are best friends. He is a year older than me and his sister a year younger. Our families live a two minute walk from one another, so growing up we would spend a lot of time at each other\u2019s houses on play dates. His sister and I were close as children but I became closer with him when I hit puberty, probably because he was older and his sister younger, and at the age of 13 a year can make a huge difference. I TOTALLY had a crush on him. Years later he admitted that he had a crush on me too. \nBy the age of 14, he started getting in to drugs and I was far too well behaved for that so we drifted apart. His sister and I remained friends for a couple of years but by the time I was 16, we had drifted apart too. \n\nFast forward 8 years and I am at a comedy night with nex\u2019s sister. We had recently reconnected as she had moved back to our hometown. A mutual friend from our childhood was performing his set at a local club. \n\nThen *he* turns up.\n\nI hadn\u2019t seen him in almost ten years. We immediately embraced. It was emotional seeing him after all that time.\nHe insisted on buying me drinks and catching up, and I was happy to do so. The sister left us as she had work the next morning, and we continued to drink and chat. Next thing I know I\u2019m in his flat. More alcohol. It was so lovely to be with someone so familiar, reminiscing on fond childhood memories. Of course, he was a man now. I couldn\u2019t help but feel attracted to him. I\u2019m now fairly certain that it was just the alcohol.\nWe slept together and when I woke up in the morning, I was filled with a massive feeling of regret. I felt like I had totally betrayed his sister (and I had) and I knew that I had altered my relationship with this man forever. \nLooking back on it now, the love-bombing started that very morning. He ran out to buy me breakfast and showered me with compliments and kisses. I felt extremely uncomfortable. \nI had a vague sense that I had overshared the night before, divulging information about my situation at university and my home life. I think I even cried at one point. It was very hazy. (He later used this information to manipulate me)\nI left his flat and within 5 minutes received an extremely affectionate text from him. My stomach began to churn. What had I done? \n\nThe texts kept coming over the next few days. \u201cI can\u2019t wait to kiss you again. You\u2019re so beautiful xx\u2019 I responded to them late and in a vague fashion. I knew I had to tell him that the sex was merely a drunken mistake and that I didn\u2019t want to pursue anything further with him. \n\nI plucked up the courage to call him, telling him that while I enjoyed the sex, I didn\u2019t think dating would be a good idea as our families are so close and I didn\u2019t want to risk any trouble. He took the news surprisingly well. I felt hugely relieved.\n\nBut the texts resumed a few days later. Tentative at first. Cautious. Always with two kisses at the end, mind. I tried to keep my resolve, but to be honest, after a string of shitty guys who gave me mixed signals and didn\u2019t really respect me at all, it felt really nice to be so lavished and pursued. He posted gifts through my letterbox, he brought me hot chocolate and coffee every day. Despite my gut feeling being one of almost revulsion, I felt like I couldn\u2019t stop. The cognitive dissonance I experienced was like nothing I have felt before. \nOn one hand, I wanted to run for the hills. Something inside me was telling me to run. It didn\u2019t feel real. I didn\u2019t even know if I liked him. All I knew was *he* liked me *very much.* On the other hand, I felt SPECIAL, and I loved it. I really really loved it. My life was crumbling all around me but I had someone in it who seemed to think I was the best thing in the world. No one had ever treated me so well.\n\nI ended up staying at his flat more and more often. Less than two weeks after we first slept together, he told me he was in love with me. My gut feeling, again, was one of revulsion. And my god, I wish I ran when he said that. I told him I appreciated the compliment but I felt it was too early to reciprocate. He told me he would do everything he could to win my heart. And he did.\nHe showered me with gifts, he took me on wonderful dates to the theatre and for dinner. He was, on paper, the \u2018perfect\u2019 boyfriend. Obviously there were plenty of red flags but I had never dated an N before so I didn\u2019t really see them. (E.g. ALL his ex\u2019s were abusive, apparently!) \n\nAnd then, I can\u2019t pinpoint the moment exactly, but one day, the idealisation and the love-bombing stopped. \n\nHe started becoming violent. I suddenly felt very stuck. Terrified. Physically stuck. I became unable to leave his flat. I had effectively moved in without planning it, and become a prisoner. He wasn\u2019t *actually* keeping me prisoner; I just couldn\u2019t leave, as hard as I tried to. My legs wouldn\u2019t go. I sat on his sofa all day when he went to work, just staring at the ceiling. I stopped contacting friends and only texted my family about once a week. \n\nAfter not seeing me for weeks despite living a 10 minute walk away, my mum insisted that I meet her for lunch one day near his place. I managed to leave to meet her. She has since said that she almost broke down in tears when she saw me, because I was unrecognisable. I apparently had this look on my face that she had never seen. I seemed broken. \n\nWhile I was held emotionally captive in his flat, I found out that he had been using webcam websites where he paid models to mutually masturbate. He\u2019d do it when I was asleep. \nI called him out on it and he flipped. He then apologised and said he would never do it again and that he would make it up to me. Classic.\n\nI caught him doing it again some weeks later, and that\u2019s when he ended the relationship. He told me it was over and that he never loved me. I was so distraught I had a panic attack. I screamed and cried. It was the suddenness of it all, like a switch had been flicked. Looking back, I can see that he felt his facade of a faithful and devoted partner had been well and truly busted, and he saw no way of redeeming himself so he ended it there and then. I had rumbled him. He could no longer pretend to be the person he wanted to be.\n\n\n\n\nThat was two years ago. We kept in contact for a month or so after the break up as I had a lot of stuff at his flat, despite only living there with him a few months. Once it was all transferred back to me, I blocked him on every social media platform I could find. We have had no contact since. I went to therapy for a year, and although I wasn\u2019t able to talk about my relationship with my nex, I talked out a lot of other things regarding my childhood etc, and I am in a much better place as a result. My father stopped drinking, miraculously. I met someone new and have been in a positive relationship for over a year now. Things are a million times better than they were two years ago.\n\nHowever, the other day I stumbled across a social media account which his sister (who I am now friends with again, although I don\u2019t think our relationship will ever be the same) had interacted with. It was a joint travel account run by my nex and his new girlfriend. The girlfriend is a few years younger than me and is from America. One of their Instagram posts, posted a week ago, tells the story of how they met in January 2019 (only 3/4 months ago) when she was studying in England for a few months. They fell in love quickly, apparently (no surprises there.)\n\nThen it said that he is moving to America at the start of May so that they can begin their lives together. My stomach dropped.\n\nWhy did I feel this way? All I have dreamt about since the break up was that he would miraculously disappear. I wouldn\u2019t wish death on anyone, not even him, but the next best thing would be if he just vanished. We still live only ten minutes away from each other and frankly it\u2019s a miracle that we haven\u2019t bumped in to one another. The thought of it happening makes me feel sick.\nSo this was perfect! He\u2019s moving to America! I don\u2019t have to worry about seeing him anymore! \n\nBut no. It\u2019s not perfect at all. This poor girl has no idea what he is truly like. Being long distance has meant that she hasn\u2019t got to spend a lot of time with him in person. He is able to moderate and control what she sees. She probably hasn\u2019t seen the anger yet. He is able to maintain his facade. \nIt won\u2019t last. Soon after moving there, he will become aggressive and violent. I know he won\u2019t be able to hold it in. \n\nThis has really affected me. I think partly because I haven\u2019t actually dealt with what happened with my nex. I buried it massively. It was too painful to address. Seeing that post hit me in hard the feels in a way I didn\u2019t expect. Because I don\u2019t want her to feel how I do. I don\u2019t want anyone in the world to go through that hell.\n\nSince seeing the post, it\u2019s like I\u2019ve reawakened the trauma. A big part of me wants to warn this girl, perhaps from an anonymous account, but I am not sure if I will be doing this for the right reasons. Am I being overtaken by my strong feelings? Am I really thinking about her, or am I *finally* feeling the rage that I should have felt two years ago, and wanting an outlet for it? Do I want revenge? What good will telling her do? She\u2019s probably already been love-bombed and manipulated so much that she\u2019s in the palm of his hand, and won\u2019t listen to any warnings. \nMy mum and his mum are still best friends. I made sure to keep them out of the break up. I\u2019m scared that if I message her anonymously, he will work out that it was me, and tell his mother, who will fall out with mine. She is fiercely protective of her son and, I think, in denial about his nature. I am in no position to judge about that as I do not know what it is like to have a child. \n\nCould I be putting her in danger by warning her? If she brings it up with him when he gets to America will he lash out? Could I be putting myself in danger?\n\n\nNow, this is definitely a little bit devious, but I had an idea earlier tonight. I remembered that my iCloud might still have the log in details of the sex website he used to use to cheat on me with. By a stroke of luck, the details were in fact saved on the cloud. I had a peek (I know, it\u2019s bad, but I had my reasons) and he most recently had webcam sex 2 days ago. Before that it was 2 weeks. \nNow, I don\u2019t know the details of their relationship. They could have an open arrangement, but I am skeptical. He is BIG on monogamy, at least outwardly. He used to pretend to me that he didn\u2019t even watch porn, even though I told him I had no issue with it. That\u2019s why the online cheating was so awful, because he had purposefully deceived me in to thinking he didn\u2019t even watch porn, never mind pay to hire webcam models. To me, paying women to have online sex with you is 100% cheating. Porn is fine, but once it becomes a transaction, in my view, that is a betrayal. \nI was thinking that if this girl didn\u2019t believe me about him I could tell her that he has been engaging in this behaviour. I don\u2019t know. I think that perhaps that is going a few steps too far, so I won\u2019t do it. I don\u2019t want t be gratuitous and cause her any more pain than is necessary for her to break up with him. \nBut it did prove one thing to me; he hasn\u2019t changed a bit. And THAT\u2019s what makes me think I should warn her of his abusive narcissistic nature.\n\nI really would appreciate some guidance on this. Do you think I should just let things play out, or should I give this girl the heads up that I wish I had been given?\n\n\nFor all of you who have got this far: thank you, and I apologise for how badly written this post must be \u2014 it is 4am in England and I can barely keep my eyes open. I just had to get it out as I am struggling to sleep.", "subreddit": "NarcissisticAbuse"}

But he said \u201cwait\u201d and prolonged the conversation. I got anxious that it was moving really quickly and I was afraid of what might come up if we stayed up talking so I faked falling asleep on him and left him on \u201cread\u201d. He unfollowed me on Instagram afterwards. \n\n2. He said something kind of sexual as a joke and I got immediately scared as my nex and I got sexual very quickly and I quickly labeled him as a nex for it. I stopped talking to him for a week as I was so offended and mad at the joke. He constantly texted me, remade his tinder maybe 5 times to rematch with me afterwards to try to win me over which scared me more as I was afraid he was love bombing. \n\n3. He sent me nudes as a last ditch effort to get my attention. I didn\u2019t respond very well as I didn\u2019t know what to think about a guy who sent unsolicited nudes. I was thinking very logically about my feelings instead of going off of feeling because I was so afraid of being manipulated. I liked the nudes and wasn\u2019t offended but I just was so cautious and I didn\u2019t respond well. I just said, \u201coh\u201d. And acted as if I was uninterested. I felt terrible for it. \n\n4. I think I was being quite mean and not very empathetic towards his feelings because I was just so scared. I was being kind of wishy washy about meeting up and said no to most of his initiations to meet up. I eventually agreed but I was being so wishy washy that he got frustrated and we never met up. And so we stopped talking. \n\n5. I only make myself visible when I\u2019m at \u201chome\u201d which is the city that he lives. I live in a different state for college. I turn it on not to match with him, but just so that he sees it and knows I\u2019m in the city. I dont have intentions of meeting up. \n\n6. I constantly stalk his social media and see what he\u2019s up to. Even though he\u2019s blocked me. I log into my friends accounts and look. I feel crazy.", "subreddit": "NarcissisticAbuse"}

He looked almost exactly like Bob Dylan from his disheveled curly hair to his cheekbones, he spoke and sang just like BD, had the same aloof and arrogant personality as BD, and so forth. To the extent that I now panic and feel nauseous if I hear a Bob Dylan song or see a picture of him, because it feels like I am looking at my ex, and my brain has somehow decided that they are the same person.

{"post_id": "behrri", "created_utc": 1555564547, "title": "Was This Sibling Physical Abuse? (Possibly Triggering)", "author": "8thMillenialProblem", "self_text": "I'm kind of new to reddit and the whole \"asking people on the internet personal questions\" thing, but I guess I've been wondering about this for a little bit now and would like some feedback. Sorry for the long post.\n\nFor background, I am 24F (and a trans woman), and I am in particular asking about things my older brother did. When we were young (he's about 15 months older than me), we used to \"fight\" a lot. By fight, I mostly mean it would start out as playing and then turn into him getting more aggressive/violent. My mom used to tell us to \"knock it off or one of you will get hurt,\" but the one that got hurt was always me. And the reaction from my mom (and sometimes dad when he was there) was essentially to get over it/stop crying/be a \"big boy.\" That is how most of this stuff was written off by my parents/others: it's just boys being boys. Of course, I was pretty feminine as a child and hated it when things got more physical.\n\nAnyway, all of that is just background. I'm more curious of everyone's opinions having to do with what he did, how I reacted, and how I react to similar situations now. I'll get the big stuff out of the way first. These are the biggest injuries that immediately come to mind:\n\n1. Around age 6, he was very angry at me (for some reason I can't remember), and came to my room red-faced. He grabbed a domino off the floor (I liked to build things with dominoes) and threw it at my face. He chipped 4 teeth, and I pretty distinctly remember how the chips felt in my mouth. I had to get some kind of dental filling to fix them.\n2. Around age 5 or 6, there was a big ice storm where we lived. One day, the two of us got a baseball bat and went around the yard hitting things with it to knock off the ice. At one point, he wanted to scare me and swung the baseball bat at my face. He said he wasn't trying to hit me, but he didn't stop it in time and it slammed into my mouth. I remember putting both hands to my mouth, blood running through them, as I ran back inside. I had to hold my head over the sink until the bleeding stopped. Also (I didn't learn this until very recently actually), he apparently told my mom that the bat bounced off of something and hit me in the mouth. \n3. Around age 4, we were playing some game indoors that included a lot of running. He ran out into the living room (through a hallway), and I followed him. It turns out that he hid around the corner that opened up from the hallway to the living room. He jumped out as I was running and grabbed my legs. I fell down and split my head open on a side table. I don't remember anything after that, but my mom said there was blood everywhere and she had to rush me to the hospital to get stitches.\n4. (This one is very graphic) When I was 3, we were playing some dumb game where one of us would go into our bedroom closet (we shared a room at the time) and the other would take one of those huge bouncy balls (the kind from Walmart that you can jump on) and throw it at the door. Well, he had his turn, and I went into the closet (something that has a funny double meaning nowadays :P). I don't remember this very well, but I think I was reaching out to shut the door and he slammed it on my hand. My left ring finger was almost completely cut off; there was only a little skin attaching the top half to the bottom half (it was cut between the two middle knuckles). I don't remember the pain, but I do remember seeing two white circles surrounded by red. I had to get it sewn back on, and by the luck of (mostly) modern medicine, my finger functions normally and has normal sensation. It does look a little weird, though. This event is the only of these four that I find to mostly be an accident (as far as I remember), but it was also the worst so I thought I would mention it.\n\nOkay, so those are the big things. On a smaller scale, he often bullied me, using the fact that I wouldn't fight back to hurt me in some way. I got several black eyes from him. Also, at one point around age 7, I stubbed my big toe really really badly (I think now that it was probably broken, but I had been conditioned at that point not to seem weak, so I didn't ask to get it treated). It took almost two months to heal (I had to walk on the side of my foot for most of the summer), but I think it wouldn't have taken nearly as long if he hadn't kept stomping on it every chance he got. He also would sit on me, wrestle me down, and hit the sides of my ribs. I have a younger brother, too (by about 7 years), and he recently got big enough to do pretty much the exact same things. A couple of times in the last year, my younger brother has sat on my head (with pillows between us), and I started panicking. I couldn't breath, and it just filled me with such fear. After he went back to his room both times, I ended up crying.\n\nMy older brother also never respected my privacy. I often had to beg for a lock to my room every time we moved because he would barge in without knocking, regardless of what I was doing. \n\nSo why am I thinking about this now? Well, I had never thought of this as possibly sibling physical abuse. I guess I internalized what my parents said and just thought it was normal childhood rough-housing. But recently I've been more critical of my childhood and have started dealing with some issues related to childhood sexual abuse as well. I saw the words \"physical abuse\" and for the first time realized that siblings can physically abuse, too. And it does explain some things. I have wondered for a very long time why I reacted with such fear when someone was angry, even if it was not directed at me. I am terrified of anger, especially from men. But the sexual abuse didn't really include any anger from what I remember, so I didn't have any place \"to put it\" so-to-speak. I remember being around my brother when he got angry, and I would just freeze up (my preferred response to conflict) and hope he didn't take his anger out on me. \n\nSo, in short, categorizing this as physical abuse has helped me to make sense of some reactions I have now in the present.

Recently someone I know had something I needed very much. This person thought I said something bad about them when I was talking about someone else who was doing something legitimately bad. This person emailed me attempting to expose me for having toxic opinions. They forwarded the email to people who've been abusive to me in the past. After we talked they friended me on Facebook and agreed to help me in obtaining what I needed in the first place. They still never apologized and frankly I'm very surprised I haven't gotten any hate mail from my abusers. I know some may have felt my opinions were not accurate yet I don't feel that was called for. I also dont feel anyone else would have been treated the same as people have expressed worse things and gotten away with it. This causes me to turn inward to a point where I question things in a way I feel may be toxic. I could have been wrong in an approach and the road to hell analogy may be true but mine arent any worse than anyone else's.

I\u2019m 20 years old and adopted. I was adopted as a baby and the person who adopted me adopted five other kids. I don\u2019t want to go through the whole story but the people who raised us were psycho and had issues I was molested by my niece when I was a kid and I remember everything nobody talks about it and I still see her every now and then to this day. Nobody helped me deal with it and it got sweeter under the rug. \n\nThree of my brothers have special needs (autism, Down syndrome, prader willi) my sister and two of my brothers were previously severely abused before my adopted mom got them and my adopted mom couldnt handle  us so we all moved in with my aunt and uncle. My aunt was a fucking psycho and my mom just went along. \n\nOne time my aunt flicked my autistic brothers mouth until blood was everywhere and my mom went along with it. He would throw tantrums and they would hold him down and mock him. \n\nThey did the same to my one brother Issac who was a psychopath. He tried to kill us and burn the house down, he wanted to chop my head off with an axe and my parents would just hold him down and mock him for hours while he screamed. One time Issac tried to drown Sam his own twin (the one with autism) and he tried to bash my sisters head in with the wooden swing he tried to break the neck of my prader willi brother chase and he tried to burn the house down. He would snip scissors close to my face and punch me. And my parents would just lock him in his room. \n\nThey put alarms on our doors and put us in our rooms all the time, I remember yelling for hours having to go pee and nobody would come. We would have to pee in the vents or pee our pants. And then we would get in trouble. One time chase and I tried to escape out the window with the bunk bed ladder but it fell.\n\nWhen we were outside of our rooms life was no better. It was a fucking prison. We had to sit on mats on the floor and we had to have an adult wherever we went we were never aloud to interact with other kids and my parents were heavy Christians.\n\nWe would always steal food for some reason and they would portion out servings and it didn\u2019t matter if we were still hungry so we over ate when we got the chance. \n\nMy aunt hated my sister. One time she acted like my sister and I weren\u2019t there for a whole day and we weren\u2019t aloud to talk. My sister stole candy I told on her, and so as a punishment my aunt made her eat nothing but candy for two weeks shoving candy down her throat and beating her when she didn\u2019t finish. \n\nI remember onetime I was locked in my room and my sister didn\u2019t finish her candy because we had to run errands so my aunt said for every minute that we were gone she would multiply that by the pieces of candy left and that\u2019s how many spankings she would get. I listened to my sister scream as my aunt beat her with that paddle. \n\nAfter that two weeks was up my sister was really sick so my aunt made her drink cold congealed broth. One time my sister wouldn\u2019t drink it so my aunt sat on top of her, pinched her nose and forced it down her throat. Btw my aunt is fat af. \n\nMy cousin was there and she later called dcfc and we said what our parents wanted us to say and they would cry and put on a show. I remember the social worker coming in and asking us and we would say everything was fine, even though my sister had bruises and shit.\n\nWe raised bunny\u2019s to butcher and I had to help kill them. My uncle would kill them in inhumane ways and I had to help. When the babies would die I would have to get up in the freezing winter and pick up their cold stiff bodies with gloves I would always get attached to the bunnies and then have to butcher them. \n\nOne time my sisters two pet bunnies (not the same ones as the ones we killed) kept chewing on my aunts computer cords so my aunt said he next time she did it her pets were going in the pot. Well it happened and the bunnies went outside with the rest to be raised to be killed. One died of sickness and the other I helped butcher. My sister was like 6 or 7 and I was 8 or 7. \n\nMy uncle was a lazy shit that had a huge temper he hated chase and would drag him down the hall when chase threw a fit. Chase used to shit on the bedroom floors so my uncle said he next time he did it he would rub his nose in it like a dog and that\u2019s exactly what he did. I heard all of it. One time my uncle said he was going to kill him and another time chase said \u201cI hate you!\u201d After my uncle took away his food and my uncle ran up to punch him at the dinner table. \n\nWhen my sister and I were like five and six my aunt and mom would tell everybody we were trying to fuck each other and had \u201cgoo goo eyes\u201d for each other. They did this up until my aunt moved out when we were 13 or 14. \n\nWe had to work all the time. The house had to be spotless and we all had a set bedtime one time my sister was late by one minute so my aunt \u201ctook control\u201d of her bed time sending her to bed whenever my aunt felt like it or keeping her awake as long as my aunt wanted. \n\nBecause Issac tried to kill us my mom gave him back up for adoption when he was like 8 and we were 6 to 7\n\nThey would always mock us for every little thing and belittle us. There are so many other things that happened that would take too long to type out. I\u2019m shaking so bad right now typing this. I moved out of my moms house and now live two hours away I moved to come work for my aunt at a gas station two years ago. \n\nAnd because we were so socially stunted I struggled in the world, people made fun of me and took advantage of me. I started to drink everyday but thank god I got out of that. I still have nightmares and mental breakdowns from what happened. I have nervous ticks and when I moved out I had a serious victim mentality that I still struggle with today. People walk all over me because I hate conflict and so people push until I hit my breaking point and get mad.\n\nThere\u2019s so much more I could talk about I could probably fill a book. As a result of all of that I struggled hard with depression and tried to kill myself three times. I\u2019m better now thanks to my current gf who\u2019s been amazing. And she helped me find my birth family who have been overjoyed to reconnect as my adopted mo withheld info on them to keep me from contacting them. and I am trying to cut off all contact with my adopted mom, and I don\u2019t talk to my aunt anymore. Im in a much better spot though I suffer from conversion disorder and I think I have ptsd my sister is trying to move away from my mom and most of my special needs siblings are in group homes.\n\nSorry for the long read and I apologize for the jumbled mess but I can\u2019t afford a psychologist but I just needed somebody to understand and give me advice on how to move past. I\u2019m in the process of starting my own business because I just want to be better then my parents but I still feel like what happened to me still effects my day to day life.", "subreddit": "survivorsofabuse"}

Big loving family from both sides and plenty of friends and cousins of my own age. Only thing is that my mother's ex was severely alcoholic. He had always been weird imo and difficult to live with, but nothing too extreme. It was when I was 17 (3 years ago) that things went downhill. For reasons unknown to me, his alcoholism got worse and worse, and his behavior became intolerable. Simply put, he was going insane. He'd get drunk practically every night and was increasingly bipolar, unpredictable, unreliable, hypocritical and childish. We would fight over random things, and it was always my responsibility to be the bigger person and make up. If I didn't do this he would continue to sulk, ignore me or be a prick. This was very taxing to me at 17. The fact that he and my mom needed to break up was clear, but he was just too far gone to become independent and get his own place. My mom wouldn't even trust him to keep hold of a debit card because he would just waste all the money on booze. \n\nAt one point we got into a fight and I decided that he for once should make amends instead of me. He didn't do it and neither did I so it was a kind of fragile state of affairs.\nAnyway, during this time late at night when I got home I greeted him and he just ignored me. He had a particularly weird and aggressive vibe to him so I wanted to get to my room as soon as possible. I grabbed something that was close to him from a shelf, and a piece of paper fell next to him. To pick it up, I would have had to excuse myself past him to reach it. Because he was drunk and not even willing to greet me back when I said hello to him, I decided not to do this. He then proceeded to get really pissed off at me for being impolite.\n\nThis for me was the last straw. I proceeded to in detail, angrily explain to him all my issues with him. His hypocrisy, immaturity and incompetence all in a coherent rant including examples. The conclusion of it being that I thought he was basically a piece of human garbage that was nothing but a burden for my family and that he was too stupid to get out even if he tried. He got into a fit of rage and got aggressive pushing me against stairs not letting me stand. At this point I thought 'fuck it, getting into a fist fight is probably the only way he will actually fuck off' so I punched him, not at full force, on the forehead. This made him go ballistic animal mode. He grabbed an empty beer bottle, broke it against the table, and stabbed me multiple times in my left tricep and back area. In the brief period before he stabbed me I could have ran or something, but I thought he was making a statement or something. I didn't even consider that he might actually stab me, considering that he was family. After he stabbed me a couple of times I begged for him to stop and not kill me and I went full Stockholm syndrome saying that we can fix the whole situation. After this the police were called, he went to prison for a couple of months and I haven't seen him since. I got my wish of him leaving but at quite a high cost.\n\nThe past 3 years have been really weird for me. I overall feel very anxious and like I need constant distractions from living in the present moment; smoking weed, listening to podcasts, my phone, etc. Also I find myself fantasizing too much about alternate realities in which things go better for me, which I don't think is healthy. Overall it's the anxiety that's my biggest problem and my inability to again appreciate life for what it really is. I feel like my body is unnecessarily on edge all the time in case I might get stabbed.\n\nI think that what's mainly holding me back is my subconscious belief that people look at me differently because I was stabbed by my own stepfather in my own house. I worry that people think I am a generally weird guy with a weird background and that they might wonder to what extent it was my fault, and if it's worth it to associate with someone with above average mental baggage. The fact that my scars are big and visible doesn't help either and has caused a number of awkward situations.\n\nAny advice is very much appreciated.", "subreddit": "survivorsofabuse"}

I wrote this a year ago and it is just as true today.", "author": "LeaveWuTangAlone", "self_text": "As some of you know, I field for divorce a couple weeks ago.  Below is something I wrote to my sister just about a YEAR ago.  All of it rings true to this day, despite N really grilling it in that he\u2019s \u201cchanged so much.\u201d  They don\u2019t change, they adapt...they become more covert, they find new language to describe their actions that are really just them railroading your boundaries - language that doesn\u2019t sound as blatantly abusive so that if (when) you try to tell someone about it, it can easily be explained away.  Stay strong.  Fuck these people.\n\n\nWritten July of 2018:\n\nPart of what upset N so much, and what he thought I was \u201clying\u201d to him about was when he read the texts between mom and me, and his sister and me, where I confided that I was planning on leaving him after this major event.\n\nI don\u2019t think this is something that I should have or could have discussed with him, though.  Had I done that, it would have added another layer of impending doom and anxiety to the entire situation; it would have been a blanket over everything we were already going through.  I didn\u2019t want him to take it as me being threatening, or holding something over his head.\n\nHe took the omission as me \u201cplotting against him.\u201d  The sad part is that I couldn\u2019t plan for that bomb if I tried.  No amount of planning can truly prepare me for that.  I was going to do it, and I was fully (mentally) prepared for literally anything to happen.  Plus, all of our money is tied up with this.  This business is feast or famine as it is. I never planned to take the kids away from him, to run away or hide, to hire a lawyer, to move in with mom or any other thing.  I just knew I wanted out, whatever that took.\n\nThe girl who was the victim in that monster domestic abuse case, that really broke our whole office and was sort of the beginning of the end, has been posting these really inspirational things about herself on social media.  Mid July was the anniversary of the guilty convictions that N got against her abuser.  So, she posts about how difficult it was, how broken down she was, how deeply she had forgotten about her happiness meaning anything, and how she is doing now.  Each post has made me cry because, especially when this case was going on, it was difficult for me to try to assist her, while seeing so many parallels between our lives.  All of the things N was trying to help her with, reminded me very much of what he should have been helping ME with, and instead he was abusing me.  It was a mindfuck and I hated it.\n\nI keep trying to explain to him that I recoil from him when he raises his voice at me while devaluing my perspective and feelings, because I\u2019m still not \u201cover\u201d all of the things he did to me, all the horrible experiences he put me through, all the memories and flashbacks I get are so vivid...yet he tries to tell me that my memory isn\u2019t accurate, that he\u2019s changed so much, that he\u2019s such a great guy, how he loves me more than anyone has ever or will ever love me in my entire life.  When he displays similar behaviors to those of the past, even if they\u2019re not identical or to the same degree, I have no tolerance for them.  The things he says don\u2019t ring true to me at all, and we can\u2019t agree to disagree, because he feels that his perceptions are of a higher, more educated, more realistic caliber, while mine are just overly exaggerated emotions.  Whereas I feel that his perceptions are wildly inaccurate, disingenuous (in that I believe he believes himself when he says these things, but they don\u2019t match with what he actually does or how he behaves) condescending and just plain mean.  It\u2019s like we have no respect for each other because we both feel dismissed as crazy.  \n\nWhen I was learning about true Narcissism and Borderline Personality disorder in my Abnormal Psych class...I was disheartened by how little there is that can be done to help these people live normal, healthy lives.  There\u2019s no medication for it, cognitive behavioral therapy is ineffective, and the very nature of these personality disorders renders these individuals truly helpless.  The very things they crave the most are the things they tend to take away from themselves via their inability to form decent interpersonal relationships.  They want love, empathy, acceptance, admiration and approval, yet they compulsively treat people in ways that push everyone away, and quickly.\n\nWhen I\u2019m interacting with the rest of the world, without him present, I\u2019m better.  I\u2019m me.  I\u2019m okay.  I have very few, if any, interactions with others that make me uncomfortable, and this is something I\u2019ve always really liked about myself.  I like people, and I like talking to people, and I\u2019m happy to just be.  When I\u2019m with him, he\u2019s often directing me what to do and where to go and telling me to change my facial expressions, not to wear that, not to say that, what my priority should be, how much I should or shouldn\u2019t care about something, how weird and unhealthy my relationships with my friends and family are, how poor my time management and general sense of organization are, etc.  I just...feel like he\u2019s constantly (without saying the specific words) telling me how much he dislikes everything about me, while trying to convince me that he\u2019s my biggest fan.  One minute I\u2019m his \u201chot wife\u201d and the next I \u201clook like (I) don\u2019t believe (I) deserve to have nice clothes.\u201d  I can literally be wearing the exact same outfit on two separate occasions and he\u2019ll say these two entirely different things; and it all seems to hinge on how loved or unloved he feels by me, or by how other people react to me.  It\u2019s like he enjoys it when I get stared at by strangers because it validates something about him and his ability to get a \u201chot wife.\u201d  I know that sounds so twisted, but that\u2019s what it feels like.  \n\nOn top of it all...everything I try to explain to him regarding what he does to me and how he treats me, he says I do the same to him, and worse!  He says I gaslight him, I\u2019m emotionally abusive to him, I project on HIM.   He is fully convinced that if it weren\u2019t for me, he never would have drank, smoked pot or gotten on his various meds.  I just...back away slowly in my mind because I know that is so absurd that I can\u2019t even really engage.  My replies are always the same, and usually end in me just repeating the word \u201cno,\u201d or \u201cI didn\u2019t say that; YOU said that.\u201d\n\nNot being around him for a few days makes me feel re-centered, whole, able to heal, able to see just how bizarre, unhealthy, and ridiculous his behavior is.  I realign with the normal that I feel is good and right for me.  I can follow my own thoughts and question them more fluidly and in a more complete way.  The opposite of this happens when I\u2019m around him and everything in my head feels far away, jumbled, incomplete, disorganized, scary, and filled with doubt.  Getting \u201clawyered\u201d is really unpleasant and disorienting.  I feel tinges of pity when I read transcripts of him deposing witnesses, where the witness loses track of what they\u2019re trying to say on account of his meandering and layered questions, while he\u2019s quickly attacking their story.  It makes him an excellent attorney, but an exhausting partner.\n\nI wish there was a way to just say this to him without it turning into him convincing me why he\u2019s so great, why I\u2019m wrong, why my feelings are inaccurate, that I\u2019m just blaming him for everything.  This is not that, at all.  I just want to tell him that the relationship is toxic for me, and toxic for our kids.  I don\u2019t have it in me to keep trying because it\u2019s not my job, nor my desire, to try to change him.  He is who he is, and I\u2019m not willing to accept him as-is.  He deserves to be loved and valued and built up, just as much as I do; and in fact, he needs all of the above way more than I do, and I\u2019m not the one who can give it to him.\n\nHe definitely has several truly incredible qualities, but they don\u2019t override my overwhelming inability to accept what I consider to be his faults.  I don\u2019t want him to begin to believe that just because I see them as faults, that everyone else does too.  I\u2019ve made the mistake before of lumping too many people into the group that finds his behavior unacceptable, in the most general sense, and I\u2019ve used it to sling rocks when he\u2019s hurt me before.  That\u2019s really none of my business, what other people think of him, but, I am my business, and I cannot tolerate it any longer.  \n\nI want us both to have the peace of being able to exist as we are.  I think really, we both need to just be alone for awhile.  This relationship has really tainted our sense of normal and changed it into something that is literally sucking the life out of me, and probably him too.\n\nBecause of me and my reactions to him over the years, he has felt unloved, unheard, unappreciated, and stonewalled.  I have various reasons for reacting to him in ways that reinforce his feelings, and ultimately, that\u2019s not fair to him.  It really could be me that is at fault for a lot of this.  It\u2019s not about fault or blame though, it\u2019s about being willing to accept responsibility, and work toward something better.  The problem is, the damage is so incredibly deep that I just can\u2019t bring myself to try harder than I already have.  To me, he isn\u2019t worth it anymore.  I can\u2019t imagine having even one more \u201cconversation\u201d about our relationship. It gives me an actual stomach ache.\n\nI don\u2019t believe that marriage requires full disclosure in real time at all times.  I don\u2019t want to be cornered into responding or conversing, having to grasp for words quickly enough so that he doesn\u2019t get mad at me for trying to contrive what inevitably comes out as a disingenuous response.  He talks so fast and in such a meandering way that I need time to process and make sure I understand what he\u2019s really saying and asking me.  How can any conversation be had when someone is tapping their foot and shaking incomplete thoughts out of me?  Why would I want to share the real me with him when it has always resulted in an attack?\n\nI\u2019m just done, and have been for a long time.

It usually ends in him just completely ignoring me until I give up trying to talk, or him insulting me or breaking items in our home and screaming .\n\nOnce he decided he is done with a conversation, he will blow up into a rage if he is not left alone . Last time he broke a wall hanging and told me he hopes I die of an overdose . Another time he broke my hair straightener and curling iron into  pieces . Every door in the house has a hole in it.\n\nWe both also have a history of addiction and are in recovery and sober now . He\u2019s 5 years sober and I am a few weeks sober (I was smoking weed but decided to quit.)We have 3 children that I take care of while he is working . I thought the issues stemmed from me , but now that I\u2019m sober these issues still arise . \n\nHe has had a history with watching porn in times where he is overly stressed . When he gets home everyday he takes a shower , and I usually ask him to bring our 3 year old son in with him (one less bath for me to give later). One day , I walk into the bathroom , our son is in the shower with the curtain closed , but my husband is sitting on the toilet masterbating to porn . I was really upset. He apologized and apparently hasn\u2019t watched porn a lot since then .(doubtful to me)\n\nI try to be there for him but any discussion that is somewhat unpleasant he just starts treating me like shit . Any other time and he\u2019s fine . By fine I mean lost in his own world and not very intimate or affectionate. But if I ask him why it\u2019s been weeks since we\u2019ve gone on a date or had sex and if there\u2019s something wrong , he just starts talking over me , stonewalls me , or will repeat phrases loudly over what I\u2019m saying (his favorite is I don\u2019t care. I don\u2019t care. I don\u2019t care.)\n\nI feel like I\u2019m married to a self centered 2 year old . We were very young when we got married but if I could go back I wouldn\u2019t do it again. We are in our mid twenties now ,and even with counseling and sobriety ,I still harbor a lot of resentment for his past behavior and am hurt by the way he steal treats issues between us . He has gone to counseling also but at the end of the day he still seems to choose himself. \n\nIf it weren\u2019t for me supporting him and staying with our children I don\u2019t think he ever would of gotten his recent promotion. It\u2019s stressful but I get my best to be selfless , clean up the house , and cook a hot meal ....still he treats me like a leech he has to put up with instead of cherishing me as his wife . \n\nDoes this sound familiar to anyone ? How can I mend things or should I just focus on getting out before it gets worse ?", "subreddit": "NarcissisticAbuse"}

Y lived all the way across the world and Nex has never met Y, but he was really nice and we would all stream movies together and stuff.\n\nSomewhere into Nex and I\u2019s relationship I stopped talking to Y (Nex began to distance me from all his friends most likely so that he could ease in the girl he was cheating on me with without suspicion). During one of my breakups with Nex I unfollowed Y and all of Nex\u2019s friends on social media. Nothing personal. Y and his friends were always really nice to me, I just felt like it was what I needed to move on.\n\nFast forward and me and Nex got back together and Nex tells me that Y mentioned that he saw that I unfollowed him and wanted to know how I was doing. A couple weeks later I found out Nex cheated on me and I broke up with him once and for all, but one of the first things I did was message Y letting him now what happened, apologizing for unfollowing him and thanking him for always being so kind to me. I also asked him for the info of one of Nex\u2019s other supplies. He was really nice and gave me everything I needed. I said thank you again and ended it there.\n\nMy birthday was the next couple of days and I get a message from Y telling me happy birthday. I was a little confused since me and Y were never very close and so I didn\u2019t know how he\u2019d remembered my birthday. He said he remembered because his was close to mine (5 days after) and I just brushed it off and said thanks and we had a little convo. Once again I ended it and moved on.\n\nI come back today and Y messages me AGAIN now asking how I\u2019m doing. I am very confused. I don\u2019t understand where all the small talk is coming from. I\u2019d like to just assume Y is a nice guy, but know that my Nex has been running a smear campaign against me for months and they are still best friends leaves me feeling uneasy. I feel like Y told Nex that we were in contact and Nex asked him to speak to me or see how I\u2019m doing. I went NC with my Nex and just assumed he would permanently discard me because when I broke up with him I fully ripped his mask off and exposed him to everyone. That and he just dropped so many hints of being actually done with me: constantly saying I seemed different and more confident as if it bothered him and therefore I was no longer a good supply and even telling the other gf to block me. Now his friend is all up in my business and I can\u2019t think of any other reason than to relay information to Nex. Is this triangulation?", "subreddit": "NarcissisticAbuse"}

In fact I cannot remember the last time I cried. During the first two months or so I could hardly stop. Anything would trigger me. I\u2019m perhaps putting this down to the anti-depressants I\u2019m taking, as well as the CBT and EMDR sessions. Maybe it\u2019s a combination of all three.\n* I still can\u2019t stop thinking about her. She\u2019s still the first thing I think about when I wake up in the morning and the last thing when I go to bed. I can\u2019t seem to stop myself. I wish I could.\n* Still not sleeping very well. I\u2019m lucky if I get three to four hours. Occasionally I allow myself the luxury of a sleeping pill but I can\u2019t take them very often. They are very addictive.\n* Still not eating enough. When I originally discovered her lies and cheating I lost 42 lbs in three months. I\u2019m still pretty skinny. Not a bad thing, I suppose.\n* Still not able to concentrate on doing any work. I can\u2019t even be bothered to invoice for money that\u2019s owed to me. For the past two months all I\u2019ve done is read about narcissists. Yesterday I read three entire books on the subject. It can\u2019t be healthy but I can\u2019t seem to stop. \n* Still drinking too much and still taking too many drugs. This began last June the day after I found out about her cheating. I\u2019ve only managed the odd day or two since then without chemical support of some kind. This is bound to take its toll sooner or later.\n* I hardly ever leave the house. I\u2019m staying at a friend\u2019s place an hour or so away from my home in London and simply don\u2019t have the energy or motivation to go and meet people. I think they call it self-isolation.\n* Still have to email her a lot because of our daughter and her trying (and (purposefully?) failing) to buy out my half of our property. Since October we\u2019ve been nasty to each other by email, nice, formal, informal. Nasty again. It\u2019s not good. \n* I\u2019ve spoken to her on the phone three times since I left (on one occasion she called me a \u2018fat c\\*\\*t\u2019!). I also made the mistake of meeting her once, due to the influence of a friend who tried to convince me to forgive her. I won\u2019t meet her again.\n* I\u2019ve blocked her from all social media and also blocked any mutual friends. I\u2019ve also blocked her phone number. She can only contact me via email.\n* She denies it but she\u2019s turned her family against me (I\u2019m not particularly concerned as I now realise that her very weird father is also NPD, probably the cause of her NPD). She\u2019s also turned many mutual friends against me by calling me \u2018Crazy\u2019 and \u2018abusive\u2019.\n* I\u2019ve just had STD tests (long overdue because it never actually occurred to me to do so until recently) and waiting for the results.\n* I\u2019ve engaged a lawyer who has been instructed to commence divorce proceedings on the day that I receive the money from her for my half of our property.\n* I\u2019m trying to assemble doctor\u2019s letters confirming that I have clinical depression and C-PTSD. I have a feeling I\u2019ll need as much ammunition as possible once the divorce begins.\n* I haven\u2019t had an argument or lost my temper since the day I left. For the last 17 years my life has been dominated by continuous arguments with my wife. I can\u2019t remember what they were ever about. It\u2019s nice to be calm and placid, as I used to be before I met her.\n* In the course of therapy I\u2019ve discovered that I can barely remember anything of the last 17 years. It\u2019s really bizarre but most of it is genuinely a blank to me. I can remember very few isolated incidents \u2013 only form the beginning and end of our relationship.\n* My health is far better since leaving her. My heart condition has disappeared. As has my Stage 2 Hypertension. Incredibly, my thyroid condition also appears to be in remission. I\u2019ve actually had to reduce my medication, which is not medically possible.\n\nSo yes, I\u2019m in a better place than I was six months ago.

There\u2019s so many things going on outside of my control that my significant other has been apart of that is affecting me that I don\u2019t completely understand and that is causing me to fall back into my childhood mentality that I am having a hard time remembering if I\u2019m dreaming or not.", "subreddit": "NarcissisticAbuse"}

I haven\u2019t text or called this number. I thought I had blocked him, but clearly not. I know he has two numbers, the second he got around the time we were breaking up for the final time. This was the conversation as follows:\n\n\u201cI think you got the wrong Number, this is (insert nex name)\u201d\n\nI replied with \u201cI haven\u2019t text this number.\u201d\n\nHe said \u201cI got a text from this number an hour ago saying, what made you feel like you had to go out of your way to lie about it when you could of just said nothing because i didnt even ask what went on?\u201d \n\nMy response: \u201dMust be an old text. I haven't sent any texts to this number or any texts like that to any other number.\u201d\n\nHim: \u201cOkay yeah must be really old, sorry\u201d\n\nAnd that was it. The text he referred to I\u2019m sure I have sent in the past. Which would have been when he discarded me and we still lived together. He kept making out he was going to give me another chance, then I found out he\u2019d done stuff with another girl, and even had her in our house whilst I did a 12hr shift, but he lied about it. \n\nAt first I felt like a deer in head lights. I felt helpless. I sunk into myself and became mute. Just a simple interaction drained so much energy from me. I scrambled my brain for logic. Was he playing mind-games? If it is an old text that\u2019s been sent out, how is that so as this text would date back at least over a YEAR ago? Is he just trying to check this is my number or if I have him blocked? \n\nAfter a while, I realised trying to understand was pointless. It reminded me of exactly how I use to feel. I\u2019ve been meditating daily and taking part in online classes with mediation practitioners. So I allowed myself to remember how that all use to feel, the constant dis-ease that came with his actions. They were never transparent. And that lack of clarity use to make me feel crazy. I sat with the feeling - as uncomfortable as it was - and reminded myself that nothing right now is happening. I\u2019m not in any danger, I\u2019m safe, we aren\u2019t even in the same town and I am in control of myself and my emotions. I reminded myself of how far I\u2019ve come along and that this doesn\u2019t have to set me back. \n\nSurprisingly I didn\u2019t feel anger, I felt sadness at first. But after assessing the situation, acknowledging how I feel and just allowing it all to run its course - I actually felt a desire to forgive. I don\u2019t want to reach out to him and forgive him, I don\u2019t mean like that. I mean I feel my next step is to make peace with the past. I want to forgive what I do not understand and just let it go. I\u2019m still hurt and the pain is still slumped across my chest as it is most days, but I feel this reaction is massive for me. A big step. I didn\u2019t cry, I didn\u2019t having an anxiety attack and I didn\u2019t allow myself to spiral with the helpless thoughts. I oddly feel some closure, how that\u2019s the case when I haven\u2019t actually got anything from him I don\u2019t know. \n\nIt was just today I had snapchat flashbacks come up on my phone, so videos/photos I took a year ago today came up. Those videos and pictures were of us two at a bbq together. I was sad seeing it, but then remembered that actually that day I felt horrible. He pushed me to the side and even made out all the girls at the bbq fancied him. I thought (as I have continuously the past 10 months) what would I do if he ever messaged me or I saw him. And i\u2019m proud of how I reacted to his message today, despite thinking for so long any interaction would cause a massive breakdown or I would be brainwashed instantly again.\n\nI feel like this situation has only reaffirmed the strength I have built for myself. I will use it as a test on how willing I am to apply all that I have learnt this far, through working so hard on myself. I\u2019m sure he wanted to throw me off - because even if he did receive a text you would surely ignore it - but his attempt remains futile.", "subreddit": "NarcissisticAbuse"}

Me right now. I\u2019m sure others have felt this. \n\nI met a narcissist on a dating app a little over 3 weeks ago. Love bombed me hard, you know the usual. He lives 2 hours away and after 4 days of texting we met up. It was amazing to say the least and a very very wild ride (date lasted 2 days) and I thought it was amazing... unique... something I\u2019ve never had before. Fast forward 2 weeks and my best friend helped me realize that he\u2019s a narcissist because her cousin married one and went through hell and back. So I left him. Blocked him everywhere. Not even a day later and I\u2019d unblock him looking for excuses to not let him go. That lasted until  Monday. I did a lot of research on narcissism and as bad as it sounds I was sooo curious to see him in person and see his act knowing what I know now about narcissism. So I acted like I was very sorry and had him come visit. He got a hotel since my place isn\u2019t exactly the best to be in. Let me just say... The experience of being around a narcissist is so much more different when you know their underlying issue. Every single time he tried to manipulate me I knew what he was doing. He got angry at me several times and got into one side sided arguments (him, of course) and it was just so satisfying to know something he didn\u2019t. The things he said no longer hurt me like before. The most satisfying thing was how I would look him dead in the eye when he was fired up... and he\u2019d get so insecure that he got even more mad saying \u201cyou\u2019re making me feel uncomfortable the way you\u2019re looking at me. This is new. You\u2019ve never done that so stop.\u201d \n\nHe ended up getting furious over something he \u201cneeded\u201d for me to prove my love for him. I won\u2019t even mention what but just know it\u2019s something nobody in their right mind would do specially with a narcissist. He said \u201cSee this is how I know you don\u2019t trust me. You\u2019re not serious about me and that\u2019s such a roadblock. If you won\u2019t do it that means we\u2019re not meant to be\u201d To which I responded \u201cI\u2019m sorry that this one thing is holding you back from continuing the relationship\u201d and I mentioned to him how everything that I tell him, he uses against me so why would I let him do that thing he wanted knowing that he would use it against me in the future. He got even more mad. As I expected. He walked out after standing at the door for a while expecting me to stop him. . Stayed in his car until I got out of the room minutes later. I went and handed him something he forgot without a word, went to my car to get his extra car key, went back and gave it back without a word... walked away.. and he kept yelling at me to stop. To come back. I just continued. He followed me with his car until I got to mine, he waited for me to get in my car to walk up to my window and threaten me some more saying if I drove off he\u2019s done with me for good. I drove off. I was shaking but I drove off. And as I\u2019m typing this I\u2019m starting to really process everything and the tears have started to come. After I drove off I parked a few blocks away and he was texting me like crazy saying he lost all respect for me and that he was going to block me and continued to bombard me with texts so I blocked him. I felt so satisfied in the moment but now it\u2019s all gone. I wish I would\u2019ve never left like that... but at the same time I know that being with him meant that he would use my past against me and eventually he would discard me. Why is it that I know he\u2019s not good for me yet I want him so bad?\n\nI\u2019m sorry for this long post but I guess I needed to vent and hear what others have to say. My post probably doesn\u2019t make sense because I\u2019m so emotional but oh well. I just need to put it out there and hopefully someone can share their personal stories of how they went about leaving and how you handled it after. Thank you.

I fled to my parents house and became isolated scared and alone. While trying to build a new life, managing divorce and custody and constant harassment I met a man online. He understood my troubles, he cared, he listened and gave advice and he quickly grew into the one person I trusted with my problems. And once again I ignored all the red flags, because he liked what I liked without me even telling him what I liked. He understood abuse because he went through it himself and he was sweet and compassionate. He did tell me he had been abusive in the past, but he had changed. The constant adoration, the declarations of love, it made all my alarm bells go off. But he also was the one person I could talk to.\n\nAfter about four months of talking he came over from halfway across the world, and even though it was a stressful time (because of my Nex husband) we had lots of fun. He stayed for a week and then went back. We continued talking all day and video chatting all the time. After about half a year we had our first big fight, and man was he abusive. Gaslighting and passive agressiveness the works. But we patched it up and I shrugged it off. He apologized, seemed to know exactly what he did wrong, said all the right things and we continued our relationship.\n\nAfter a year he came over again and apart from a day where he all of a sudden giving me the silent treatment (he said later he was just depressed and it wasn't my fault) it was lovely again. He stayed for two weeks in which me and my infant daughter grew firmly attached.\n\nThen all of a sudden things changed. He couldn't cope with my problems any more. Kept on having violent fantasies about murdering my ex. I couldn't talk about my problems anymore because he would get this aggressive angry episodes in which he demeaned and belittled me for my choices.\n\nStill, he explained he was triggered, had anxiety and flashbacks. And I forgave him. He told me he hated himself for acting the way he did and I believed him.\n\nSo a few weeks ago he came over again. We were planning on getting him an apartment in my country and he finally had the chance to actually support me because I had a court hearing. I was incredibly nervous for this hearing and he just didn't comfort me at all. He went with me while I spoke to the judge, and in the end of the hearing he lashed out at the person I was filing my complaint against (something Nex-husband related). He destroyed my calm and collected image by swearing and yelling at the opposing party and then ran out. When I caught up with him he got angry at me and berated me for about an hour. \n\nLong story short, I broke up with him then and there and demanded he fly back. The apartment was cancelled. And even though he e-mails me he's sorry and he know he fucked up but also that I'm cruel for breaking it off while we are soulmates, I am standing my ground.\n\nAs I look back I can only conclude I f*cking fell for it again. He was clearly toxic but I wanted to believe I finally found someone that would take care of me so bad. I feel so stupid. I let myself and I let my daughter get attached. I guess it could be worse, we only saw him three times. But I just feel horrible about not trusting my own unease and ignoring red flags. I feel like I should know better after all I've been through.\n\nI don't even feel bad about breaking up, although I feel guilty. I don't miss him as much as I thought I would. I still struggle to believe he was truly a narcissist, still clinging to the idea he has massive Fleas or was just broken. \n\nI am so scared I will never meet a stable person I can count on ever again. I feel like damaged goods. Like I attract toxic people. I do feel like I am condemned to just live my life alone with my daughter (not that that's such a bad thing).

Our friendship was nothing short of wonderful. We had wonderful conversations, were totally honest with each other, and mutually supported each other really well. Eventually we drunkenly hooked up. I had been seeing other people at the time but he was so persistently sweet and attentive, saying he didn\u2019t really want to see anyone else, and we eventually began a committed relationship. \n\nThat was where things started to get really tricky. I knew that he had been sad for quite some time (both about his ex-girlfriend but also not being fulfilled at work). Almost as soon as we started dating he got incredibly stressed out about a number of things I didn\u2019t realize were a problem and I was kind of blown away. We had a massive argument where he told me that he was upset because he wasn\u2019t appreciated at work, didn\u2019t own a home, that he moved for someone that rejected him, that he wasted his years on a PhD he didn\u2019t end up doing anything with, that he had to start his career over at thirty, that he wasn\u2019t as smart as he used to be, that people had wronged him and that\u2019s why his life didn\u2019t turn out like he thought it did, etc. I chalked it up to a temporary thing and doubled down on supporting him, even though he said and did some hurtful things. Among others, he told me that he usually gives his girlfriends nicknames but hadn\u2019t for me yet and didn\u2019t know why, told me I was \u201clooser\u201d than previous sexual partners when he couldn\u2019t perform, was secretive with his phone and defensive when I asked a question (and of course acted like I was unreasonable to ask in the first place), responded to any ask/needs I had with \u201cI\u2019m a terrible person and boyfriend\u201d then continued on doing the same things I had told him hurt my feelings. \n\nOne big point of contention was him not being transparent/communicative about his friendships with the opposite sex. I had told him that I didn\u2019t inherently have a problem, but did appreciate him being upfront about his plans and to make sure he set appropriate boundaries. He later told me that he had stopped hanging out with all his friends (and family) as much because he was afraid of how I would react, even though I encouraged him the entire relationship to go out and spend time with people (????).\n\nOver time the sex dwindled (because I had made him feel bad about it), but more frustratingly he started lying about little things, and eventually big things, under the guise of him being too scared to hurt me and that his biggest flaw is that he hates to hurt people\u2019s feelings. \n\nThe relationship issues culminated in a two-month long trip to Europe he went on with his friend (of course we never took a vacation together despite me asking and even planning things) that I ended up supporting him doing because he \u201cdidn\u2019t want to feel like crying every day.\u201d To give him space, I ended up moving out while he was gone. When he came back he was just as unhappy before (and of course the texts I got from him on the trip were rather morose). He ended up revealing that his friends\u2019 parents were there for a part of the trip and that he stayed with them for a week. Unfortunately his friend is also the brother of his ex (the same one he was devastated over when we were friends). I asked if she was there and he said, point blank, she wasn\u2019t. A mutual friend later told me she was and he later confessed. Of course it was my fault, because he \u201cknew I would be upset\u201d and that\u2019s why he didn\u2019t tell me.\n\nHonestly I\u2019m exhausted. I took the blame for so many things that I in hindsight weren\u2019t really my fault (that he didn\u2019t go to the gym, that he wasn\u2019t happy, that he didn\u2019t hang out with his friends or family, that he didn\u2019t get the job he wanted because he spent more time with me than prepping for it). \n\nI\u2019m crushed because even now I\u2019m still trying to do the mental gymnastics to figure out how I could\u2019ve been better/more supportive/less needy/whatever to make the relationship work. \n\nI\u2019m mad because he is such a sweet and caring person to his friends, humble, gracious, kind, and funny\u2026 but the second we\u2019re alone together he becomes sullen and withdrawn and unloads his problems on me. \n\nI hate that I\u2019m the only person that sees this side of him, and I hate that I\u2019ll probably just be another flawed ex in his book. I hate that he won\u2019t take responsibility for his actions but mostly I hate that I feel crazy over this. I\u2019m so full of doubt it\u2019s ME. Sometimes I look back and I'm like, \"well that wasn't so bad maybe I'm overreacting.\" I\u2019m still **so** terrified its my fault.", "subreddit": "NarcissisticAbuse"}

So this abuse escalates. That was me! I couldn't stay quiet. I also think he kept doing this on and off with me for years every time he needed supply.

The difference is, transitional targets never experience that \u201cfull\u201d idealize phase, with some time and stability for things to blow up. This is because the psychopath never intended for the transitional target to become a stable part of their life to begin with. You were perfect for what they wanted at the time: attention and admiration.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;And that\u2019s the point\u2014psychopaths typically can\u2019t last long with empathetic people (except for cases with children and long-term manipulation), because you tend to absorb their poison. Yes, they get the high of sweeping you off your feet and making you a perfect servant to their mind games. But the downside is, eventually you subconsciously spit that poison right back in their face. You don\u2019t want to ruin the idealize phase, but you find yourself unable to stop pointing out their lies and changed behavior.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAfter seeing him move onto a \"public\" relationship very soon after having on-and-off-and-on virtual/online relationship with me (we only met once, and he dumped me EVERY time), I'm starting to think this was the case.\n\nThat he just picked me up and dropped me to get his secret boost of negative supply before moving onto someone he wanted to settle with. That he never wanted to actually see me, that he never wanted to actually spend time or effort or money or ANYTHING on me. He had no need to have me in his life in any way.\n\nThat's why it didn't matter that I wasn't his type, or anything. He didn't actually need any kind of real life relationship with me. I was just words on a screen to abuse. And sex the one time we met.\n\nI was also very easy to hide from everything, and easy to hide everything from. So I have absolutely no idea what else was going on. Probably a lot.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHe just used me. And he didn't even use me as a \"main\" source, just a side piece to suck the energy out of while I made him my entire life. I must have provided him with amazing supply as and when he wanted it with absolutely zero need for effort from his side. At the same time, he could toss me to the side easily and I'd never leave because I preferred having him in my life.\n\nAnd now he wants NOTHING to do with me. His exes are allowed to be his friends, but I guess seeing as I wasn't a part of his \"real life\", he has no need for me.\n\nHe can just toss me out like a tissue.\n\nI don't think he ever intended me to be long term. That was why he was able to keep me around for years, because he would threaten discard or tell me to leave him alone ALL THE TIME and I would accept it. I would sit in silence for days knowing if I piped up he'd leave me.\n\nAnd he would leave. He didn't even need to love bomb me because he knew I wouldn't leave. And if he left, or if I did - he wouldn't care. I was nothing. There was no need to get me to stay.\n\nBut now he has a girl he actually has as a girlfriend. At least, to the world. If he is a narc, then I know that doesn't mean anything but it still seems like more than what I got. She actually gets to be a girlfriend, a part of his life. Or something..... its not like I didn't get absolutely ruined by this whole scenario.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy mind is so so fucked up right now. :/ Why does this hurt so much???? Like \"oh, he obviously CAN have long term relationships, just not me...\"\n\nLike, he never wanted me as a long term anything. So who I was did not matter. All that mattered was I had supply to give him. I'm probably just useless. He probably didn't even want me the way he said he did.\n\nUgh. Why does this hurt so bad?

She has yet to hoover, and if you\u2019ve read my previous posts, I\u2019m on the best trajectory of my life. Just in a really awesome space with everything right now. \n\nAnyway, there\u2019s this girl I\u2019m friends with on FB. One of my former employees who always had a thing for me, and is kinda cute, but not really my type. I keep my FB very tight-knit and don\u2019t allow friend requests beyond who I\u2019m already friends with. So they have this new thing called, \u2018Profoundly.me.\u2019 Someone can anonymously ask you something, and you can answer &amp; choose to share it.\n\nThat girl messaged me anonymously saying she used to have a big crush on me. I responded that I\u2019m flattered and of course she used it as an invite to message me directly. Said I should \u2018come visit\u2019 her at work sometime. I didn\u2019t respond to that, and glossed over to the next thing she said to me. See, she started dating this other employee of mine about 4 years back when they were both my employees. They\u2019ve both long since quit my company I work for, and last year they both got jobs at the same place. She dumped him out of nowhere earlier this month. I don\u2019t know why. She always seemed head over heels for him. And he\u2019s posted very little, only once throwing shade in the form of a captioned image: \u2018Don\u2019t get it wrong: I don\u2019t miss you, I miss the person you pretended to be before the mask fell off\u2019\n\nThat thing he posted alone perked my senses a bit. And then I filtered through the selfies she had taken the past few weeks. Holy hell, harkens right back to my nex after she dumped me. She looked like my nex in the pics, but didn\u2019t look like her...if that makes any sense. Not to mention, she messaged me out of the blue back in December when they were still together. Thought that was odd in itself.\n\nSo I didn\u2019t like how fresh their breakup was, I wasn\u2019t crazy interested and all of these parallels drawn. like, you want me visit you at your work, where he works, when he knows who I am and that I would know full-well that you guys broke up? Yeah, no.\n\nSo she stopped messaging me. Today, she posted a picture of her kissing/laying shirtless in bed with a new guy. She was weighing options between new supplies! Just like my nex did to me. \n\nI have no doubt in my mind she is a narc, given her troubled past. And how abrupt her breakup seems and how her ex bf has reacted. The pictures/statuses she\u2019s posted. When she worked at my job, I remember she was known for crying her eyes out &amp; throwing a tantrum whenever something didn\u2019t go her way. That was a red flag to me, for sure. I was worried if I went to  lunch with this girl, that word would get out about it at work. I didn\u2019t want that.\n\nThis is the first time I followed my gut because a person didn\u2019t feel right. And sure enough, I was right to: she has already ensnared a different guy. Within probably just a day of our last exchange. My toxicity radar is finely tuned these days, I suppose. I\u2019m glad I\u2019m learning to say \u2018no.\u2019", "subreddit": "NarcissisticAbuse"}

I noticed something was off about him on our very first date and after I spent some time with him I came to the mistaken conclusion that he had Aspergers/ASD (something I likely have myself). Because of this belief, I endured his abuse and allowed for him to toy with me, intimidate me, and humiliate me over the course of a year thinking that he didn't realize how any of it made me feel, believing he would never do that stuff to me if only I could get him to understand. I always told him \"I'll be patient\". In the end he moved cross country without telling me, effectively abandoning me, and I was able to bring myself to cut contact with him after that. I have not heard from or spoken to him in a year nor do I plan to, although I have heard he's moved back into the area and I fear running into him.\n\nAnyway, it was not until a couple weeks ago that everything clicked. All of his bizarre behaviors (infrequent and unsettling eye contact, never answering yes or no questions, ghosting me at random for days or weeks at a time, talking over me or ignoring what I said altogether, making me perform degrading sex acts, having his own damn name tattooed on himself, etc.) that I had attributed to quirks of Aspergers were much more consistent with covert narcissism, and I had the gut wrenching realization that everything he did to me was intentional. Like, blatantly intentional. He probably got bored of me because I was so very easy to manipulate and didn't put up much of a fight no matter what he did to me. \n\nI'm glad that I finally have an answer to explain the million little questions I've had about him and the way he treated me, but now what? I'm so angry at him and at myself for letting him get away with everything. I wish I could out him and warn other girls but he is a recluse and moves around a lot (he likes to think of himself as a \"ramblin' man\"). I once asked him if he has Aspergers (he never gave an answer naturally) but now I fear he may go on to use that as a cover, and I hate that I might have empowered him somehow. Even though I have a loving boyfriend now I still have issues left over from my ex, such as no longer finding certain sex acts enjoyable when I used to be very sexually open, or shutting down at random times because I'm triggered by the smallest things. I have not felt ok emotionally ever since I met my ex and I've just been floundering despite seeing a therapist regularly and even doing an IOP program. What do I need to do to move past this?

I was diagnosed at 16, I'm now 20. Due to my disorder, I've been seeing psychiatrists for the past four years, two of which were when I was with my ex. I also see a therapist as well, but lately with my appointments, when they ask if I've had panic attacks or what's been bothering me, I mention that my ex has been showing up again and that's what's triggering them. Just seeing his vehicle makes me shake horribly and it's almost like I can't do anything, even though I only see him when I'm at work because I live 45 mins away from that city. \n\nMy last psych visit was a couple of weeks ago, and he told me I was showing heavy symptoms of PTSD when it comes to my relationship along with the verbal abuse I was dealt when it came to my stepmother. My therapist agreed and him and I had been doing EMDR therapy, which is a therapy where you follow something with your eyes and describe the memories that come up, with things pertaining mainly to my ex. \n\nI've seen him two more times since the last incident. The first time was when he drove past me on my way to work. He was heading up the route that leads to the city where I live now and I was heading towards the city where I work. His vehicle sticks out like a sore thumb so it wasn't hard to catch, especially with the fact that I've been so much on the lookout for him these past few weeks that it's almost breaking me down mentally. \n\nThe second time was last Sunday. I went out to get food for my manager and I, and just my luck when I pulled back into the parking lot, his vehicle was there and he was walking out to it. Our eyes met, and he stopped as if he was waiting for a second and I just felt like I'd snapped in a way. I didn't want to run in fear for once, I wanted him to know that I was there. I guess I wanted to scare him off, but ever since starting that therapy and ever since being told I probably have PTSD, I've just had this rage towards him. \n\nAfter opening my car door, I grabbed the food, and by that point, he was pulling away, but I know he saw me and even though I was shaking like a leaf and all I wanted to do was cry, I was just so angry. I wanted him to know I was still angry after two years because him showing back up is affecting my healing process. \n\nAlong with the EMDR therapy, I've been having flashbacks. One hit me pretty heavy last night. I was laying on my stomach, trying to go to sleep and I had my head laying towards the left side of the room.\n\nIt was like I was stuck in some wonderland of six years ago. My ex and I weren't dating yet, but we were in that biology class where we met. It was the end of the semester and we were watching Finding Nemo. I was tired and upset about somrthing, and had an iPod so I was resting my head on the desk, facing the same direction as I was laying down. He was sitting next to me, and at the time I had no idea that he even liked me. He grabbed one of my earbuds out of my ear and held it up to his own, asking what I was listening to. \n\nIt felt like I'd been struck by lightening when I came out of it. I've had flashbacks before, but never in such vivid detail. I can still remember the stupid fucking expression on his face and these are details that I thought I had blocked out, but they've slipped through the cracks. \n\nIt's really fucking with my head. It feels like I want to explode because I'm going between crying and rage and at this rate, I know I'm going to see him again around my workplace and the most my managers can do is throw him out if he comes in the store so I'm stuck staring at his vehicle, knowing that he's in the vicinity of me. It makes me skin crawl and I always want to scream and cry just thinking about it. \n\nI feel broken down. I don't really know who to talk about it besides my therapist. My current boyfriend knows the story and all that's going on, but there's only so much he can do. I'm tired of this, but I know that if I quit now, I'll never heal, but if my ex is around, it's greatly hindering the progress. \n\nThis is fucked.

Have you seen the show on Hulu, The Act? I can relate to Gypsy to some extent. I'm 28 years old, with a new child, trapped here for all eternity by my grandma. Ever since she adopted me at 10 years old, she has made it her mission to diagnose everything that's wrong with me and use me to get people to feel sorry for her, as well as emotionally abuse me. I was molested when I was 5. So I had some anger issues when I was a kid. I was neglected by my mother. I had abandonment issues. She decided I had bipolar. Bought a book about it. Took me to a doctor and when they had me take the test for it she refused to let me take the test alone, she answered every question for me, when I would answer questions she would tell them I was lying and told them that I'm very manipulative. They tried several different medications on me. Trying to find the right one that worked. None of them ever did. They caused me to act out extremely, I hates it, I would sleep for days, binge eat, scream, cry, throw things, completely freak out. My grandma would accuse me of not taking my meds because of the behavior the meds were causing... So I started doing what she accused me of, I'd hide the medicine under my tongue, spit it out later. Then she started to say \"wow I can tell the meds are working you're acting so normal\"... So then I made the mistake of telling her one day. We moved out of state. I was \"homeschooled\". She said that she didn't have to register to homeschool me. She bought me 3 books for 4th and 5th graders, I was supposed to be starting my first year of high school... When I was around 17, I finally told her that I wasn't taking the meds and that my good behavior was all me. She didn't believe me. She told me how I was the most bipolar person she'd ever met. She constantly told me what I could and could not handle \"out in the real world\". Anytime I did something good that made me feel confident, she would tear me down for it. If I try to stand up to her, I get sent to mental wards. She calls 911 says I threaten suicide or threaten to kill her. Since I was a kid, and have medical records saying that I am bipolar and have chronic depression, of course they believe her. The depression is at least an accurate diagnosis. I have to act how she wants me to act, so much in fact I have no idea what my real personality is like anymore. Sometimes I wonder if maybe she's right, maybe I am crazy. I think maybe having to go through all of this for so long has made me crazy. She tells people that I have mental problems, they are confused when they meet me because I seem so normal and very smart and capable. I've been told this. Alot. I have this weird constant need to seek her approval and I constantly have to ask her permission to do things. My friends? I don't have any left. Family? They're all in another state, but also totally fooled by her. I want to get away from her but I'm afraid to be without her. I don't want her to get into trouble for what she's done. My boyfriend was very physically abusive and emotionally abusive. He lived with us for a long time. They would gang up on me often. Now I have major anxiety problems, I'm very shy and afraid to talk to people. I tried opening up to my family. My aunt, believes me. She has went through the same thing with my grandma as me. All of my grandmas kids did. My aunt says my grandma is crazy. I told her because she stays away from our family as much as possible and I had a feeling it had to do with my grandma. I need help. I have a little boy now, yes, from the abusive ex boyfriend. I'm a fantastic mother but I am a single mother and trapped by her. I need to be able to work and drive. She won't help me get my license it's been an argument since I was 18 years old. And I don't know anyone where I live who can help me. What do I do? Please. I don't want my little boy growing up in this mess. My biggest fear is that my grandma will die and my baby and I will be on the streets. Sorry if this got into rambling. :( Please, someone help me!!!", "subreddit": "abuse"}

PSA, I'm writing this very raw from the hurt. \n\nSo three years ago, after I transferred to thre college I'm at now, I met this amazing guy. Incredibly smart, self assured, charismatic, and funny. After talking awhile, we started dating. The first six months were great with the occasional argument. After that period, he said I love you and I definitely felt the sane way, so we lost our virginity to one another. Three days later, he attempted suicide for the first time. That summer, I went home because my depression had started becoming overwhelming. We also had our first huge fight. I'd later learn that he was drunk nearly the whole summer. Coming back that fall (2017), the relationship was okay and the trend was that we would get into an argument, patch things up, have sex, have a great few weeks, and repeat the cycle. During this time, he was very supportive of me as I sought out mental health professionals but refused to acknowledge his issues. Spring 2018, I planned a professional event, the day of that event, I asked him to act in a mature, professional way and avoid some jokes and comments he often makes. He responded by tripling his dosage of anxiety medication and then he decided partway through the evening that I wasn't talking to him enough and sat at a different table to chat with others (that night was also my birthday) The next day, my parents were in town and I had another formal event. He had gone back to his parents place (1 hour away) for a fire call, which he a year later informed me was fatal to a young boy he knew, and was late picking me up for my event. He proceeded to get angry with me during the event for talking to my colleague's significant other and claimed the event was too much for his anxiety and left me there with no ride home and no keys to my apartment. My parents picked me up after the event and thus began their disdain for him. A couple weeks later, my feelings of abandonment exploded and I said hurtful things to him and he said hurtful things to me and we broke up for a couple days. I begged him to take me back and he did. A month later, he accepted a job that forced him to move an hour away without discussing it with me, it was hard to deal with. There, his depression proceeded to worsen. Fall of 2018 began the name calling ( i.e. whore, b****), telling me he felt unloved, accusing me of cheating, and threatening to dump me. Things however, improved with me family. And when times where good, they were amazing. He also started their m therapy. February 2019, he moved back closer to me and I wasn't sure how to respond because I felt like I had failed him in his depression (he was always mad that I didn't make the hour drive every day to visit him and check in on him. We started couples counseling then and I thought things were getting better. In reality, nothing had changed. March 2019, he broke up with me saying I was toxic and that I had failed him and his depression. We didn't cut off contact and the argue, patch things up, sex, good times, repeat pattern escalated to nearly every two days. \nFor the past three weeks now, we've been in ab awkward limbo stage where we talk about marraige during the good times and he tells me what a pos I am during the bad. Multiple times he's threatened suicide, once I walked in on him passed out from an attempt. Last Monday, I got a tattoo (something I've wanted for thre past ten years), and he was supportive of all the way until he saw it. On my way home from hanging out with him, we were talking on the phone and suddenly he flipped and he called me a dike for having a tattoo and told me he never wanted to have kids with somebody like me and then hung up. After being unable to reach him, I went over to his place to talk and we got in another argument where he called me a c*** many, many times. I retaliated and brought up an event from his childhood that I knew he wouldn't want to hear in the hope that it would bring him back to reality so we could talk. Eventually he calmed down and we cuddled but then I had to leave. I tried to get him to lock the door but he wouldn't get up so I just left. The next morning I apologized for doing so and initially he was understanding. Then, something flipped and he got insanely angry with me. He went to my place when I wasn't there, ransacked the closet (he was looking for clothes he left), threatened to leave the door unlocked. He then proceeded to call and tell me not to come to his place that night, that he had called the police to tell them that if I did they could come get me, that he was going to block my number and removed me from social media. I let him cool off and the next morning I told him I didn't deserve to be treated that way and he somewhat agreed, still justifying and standing by his word choice. Later that day, he was happy and in love with me again and wanted to hang out, so we did. Then, today he hit mad at me for one of my friends not saying hi to him. I went to therapy for 2 hours where I talked to my therapist and came to the conclusion that he probably wasn't going to change. Tonight, we were hanging out and I brought up the cycle, I could tell he was uncomfortable and upset with it, but then he changed the topic to something else he knows we disagree on (women's rights) and wanted to argue. When he saw I wasn't willing to say that I think there should be a wage gap, that a women shouldn't be in charge of men, etc..  he got mad and stormed out. A few minutes later he told me he couldn't be with somebody who wasn't willing to agree with him on that and I asked for my stuff back. I then proceeded to take a nap (it's part of my action plan if I feel depressed or suicidal) and woke up at 4 in the morning to 17 missed calls from him, 3 from my sister, and a bunch of texts and Facebook messages because he had tried to return my stuff but I didn't answer the door or my phone because I was asleep. I've now been blocked from all his social media but I texted him apologizing for being asleep. \n\nThe worst part is that through this all, I still love him. I know I'm probably addicted to him but I feel like I need him. I know this is probably it, he probably won't change, and that I need to move on but I don't know how. I wish I knew how to stop loving him but unfortunately, I don't. \n\nTL; DR: I'm in love with an emotionally abusive man who, after our most recent fight, removed me from all social media and is very angry at me.", "subreddit": "emotionalabuse"}

We were talking about the dating app that we met on and he had once made a remark about how he often wouldn't get matched with the \"really good profiles\" or the girls wouldn't turn out to be what he expected. Maybe he got catfished or they were bots? Anyways, it just makes me think that he's the kind of guy who would chase after an Instagram \"it\" girl, which is definitely not me. It's just not who I am naturally. And it sounds like too much work.\n\nBut hey, social media messes with all of us. My coworker was talking about how her husband will sit seething in jealousy over his friends' latest travel photos on Facebook. I don't have it that bad, but if you throw in a manipulative guy who chased and pressured me into commitment and then flipped the switch on me and picked me apart, I have to admit that he has messed with my head.\n\nHe also made all these messed up comments about my age. I was four years older than him (and he chose to match with me and pursue me), but at some point I sensed that it bothered him a little. I'm 32 and personally don't see my age to be an issue - I've never really had it come up even with other guys his age. But I could tell it was weighing on his mind and asked him about it. He said made some comment about me \"having a weird biological time clock.\"\n\nI had never talked about wanting children. I didn't even bring up looking for a relationship. He told me that he was looking for a long term relationship and asked me what I wanted, I said that I was just going with the flow, which was truly my perspective at that time. He was the one who pushed for us to get closer. So I was so surprised that he saw me as having a ticking biological time bomb. It was a self-imposed prejudice that he carried - I didn't do a single thing to make him think that I was in a rush to get anywhere with anything.\n\nIt makes me sick. What was I to him? Good enough to chase after and pressure into a relationship but not good enough to respect? If I was younger and modeled my life after Instagram then maybe he would have thought I would be would be on his level?\n\nHe definitely had his own issues when it came to his self-perception. I'm pretty sure he had an eating disorder. He told me that he used to be really overweight and would eat much less than me, despite being twice my size. He would skip meals and carried around flavored water with him at all times. His room was littered with empty cans of this flavored water. I've struggled with body image issues before so I understand the coping mechanisms that people might use to deal with an eating disorder. But I saw this about him and felt bad for him - I didn't judge him for it. I cared about him.\n\nAnd I was relatively okay with myself until he started messing with my mind.", "subreddit": "NarcissisticAbuse"}

Then he started manipulating me. We started to talk even more day by day ....

I don't know why I said that ....I guess because it annoyed me when he call me an introverted person and I wanted to show him that I was open ?

He has 2 kids from a previous relationship whom I adore and who rely on me heavily and who love me also. I raised the children while he sat back and watched for the duration of that two years, ran around like a 1950s housewife, cooked for him, clothed, fed, educated and cared for the children, kept our house, managed absolutely everything financially - he seems to meet a lot of the criteria on here for being a narcissist. I became incredibly attached to him despite his treatment of me, I had an idealised version of him when he was \u201cbeing nice\u201d in my head and that\u2019s what I hold on to when I am in a moment of weakness and think about going back. \n\nWhat triggered me to leave the relationship was after my mental health hit absolute rock bottom I turned to him for support as I thought he couldn\u2019t possibly deny me that (I had \u201cearned\u201d his support after all that time, right?) his response to this was to call me insane, unstable, an embarrassment, and not actually ill at all - despite him knowing my history with mental illness, he claimed that I was faking it as a tool to manipulate him. On the day I left he hit and kicked me for the first time. This was the straw that broke the camels back for me. The sicker I got the angrier and more aggressive with me he got. I am left at a point where my mental health is destroyed. Here are some of his behaviours:\n\n-When we first met, he pursued me relentlessly, told me he had never loved someone like this, absolutely showered me with adoration and compliments \n\n-calls his exes including the mother of his two kids \u201cpsychopaths\u201d and labels all women as psychopaths \n\n- I was sexually assaulted at one point and when I told him about this he told me I was lying as a way of manipulating him. \n\n- he was either sickeningly sweet or completely shut off from me, only offering \u201cbreadcrumbs\u201d of affection just often enough to keep me latched on\n\n- he would withhold affection and sex fiercely as a means of punishment \n\n-continually criticised me for everything including my career and academic accomplishments (of which he has none - he works in a much Lower paid job than I do and still managed to make me feel intellectually and successfully inferior to him)\n\n-is now using the children as a means of manipulation. Telling me that if I walk away from him I can\u2019t have them, even though we had agreed my visitation with them. \n\n-publicly humiliated me by screaming at me in public, then getting angry and calling me an embarrassment to him for crying \n  \nI could go on.

This story is going to be an epic, so\u2026 if you don\u2019t have time don\u2019t start reading ha ha.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI\u2019ve been reading this sub for years. Ever since I googled things like \u201cWhy is he always so angry\u201d and \u201cWhy does it feel like I\u2019m always walking on eggshells.\u201d\n\nAt first, my motivation was to make things better. What could I do to fix things? I knew what was going on in my house was NOT normal. I grew up in a loving home with a wonderful family who set a great example. This man, he was supposed to love me though, so maybe I was doing it wrong and I needed to fix myself like he said?\n\nAnd then I read these stories. Stories elsewhere as well.. I don\u2019t know if he\u2019s a narc, or if he has bpd for sure honestly, but the pieces fit. I know he will never get diagnosed. The best thing he ever said about psychology was that it was a \u201cuseless pseudoscience.\u201d There is no way he would ever willingly go to one or admit that he is anything other than the perfect husband.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAt first things were good with us, though how we started out was nuts. It was a whirlwind romance. I was the other woman, but he treated me so nice. The sex was pretty good, and he was a smart, loud, handsome alpha male type. I was 10 years younger and easily charmed by this man who had money and talent. I knew it was wrong. I did it anyway.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHe left his wife for me but then moved across the country for a job opportunity. He begged me to drop everything and come live with him, because he couldn\u2019t live without me. So, I did.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThere were red flags at the time, though I didn\u2019t know what they were or how to spot things.\n\nTemper tantrums. Throwing things. Hitting the cat. Yelling at me over nothing. I remember one time vividly being yelled at until I cried over shrinking a shirt in the dryer.  I didn\u2019t think he was an asshole for doing it, I thought I was the stupid one. How could I be so careless?\n\nWe moved again, this time even farther away from my family. I almost never got to see them, and he actively discouraged me from talking to them. \u201cDid you hear what your mom just said to you? She\u2019s insulting you, you know. I can\u2019t believe how she can be so nasty.\u201d I believed him. After all, he knew better.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThings got worse after I married him and had a baby. The abuse ramped up slowly. Name calling. Yelling. Throwing things. Punching holes in the wall. If I left dishes unwashed, they\u2019d get thrown on the floor. If I left my shoes out, they\u2019d get thrown at me. I latched the door once while he was bringing in the groceries and he kicked the door until the hinges broke and screamed at me for locking him out. Little things. It was my fault. Then larger things. Shoving. Death threats. Those were a \u201cjoke\u201d that I was overreacting to when I cried. I made a two page list of things I needed to change about myself to keep him from being angry.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI had 2 more children.\n\nThings got worse. There was no affection in between spurts of foul behaviour, just indifference. He got in trouble at work and was forced into anger management. The only thing it succeeded in doing was helping him spot when I was trying to deescalate arguments and yell at me for that, too. \u201cDon\u2019t give me that \u2018I\u2019 statement bullshit, I know what you\u2019re doing!!\u201d\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThings got thrown more often. He kicked our son once. I screamed at him and cried. He told me I was full of shit, and \u201cIf I\u2019d really kicked him, he\u2019d be dead.\u201d\n\nI got shit for being \u2018lazy housewife\u2019 and got told to work once all the kids were in school. I tried to find work, but he accused me of doing it so I could cheat. What? I stopped looking for work. I got yelled at for being incompetent, stupid and uneducated, a leech.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe video game addiction was also an issue. God forbid I walk in front of the tv while he was playing, which he would do nonstop days in a row. They were more important than family. I was his maid and nanny \u2013 he had nothing to do with the kids and getting him to help was more effort than it was worth. If I asked, he\u2019d say he was busy or just be shitty to me for days for asking. I stopped asking.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHe would come home from work and go to bed at 5pm, leaving me with everything, and when asked about it, he told me, \u201cJust wake me up if you need help.\u201d  I knew waking him would result in a huge tantrum, so I just did everything myself. I had no life. I had no friends. I was miserable, gained 80 pounds. I hated myself and my life.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBut...enough was enough. I decided to at least TRY.\n\nI started slow. I started exercising. It took a long time, but I succeeded. That small success helped me pick up an active hobby I\u2019d wanted to start, a type of martial art. This decision was the best thing I\u2019ve ever done for myself. It completely changed my life, gave me purpose and confidence.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHe said some of the right words. \u201cGood for you. Get out, get a hobby.\u201d But he actively made it more difficult for me to go out. He would neglect the kids every time I left so I felt obligated and trapped inside. He would just go to bed and leave me to do everything. He would text me half way through and demand I come home. He\u2019d accuse me of cheating. I stuck with it anyway and I slowly picked my self esteem off the floor. I made some friends.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI thought maybe I could fix things. I was feeling slightly better about myself. So I started googling. And googling. And\u2026. I read about narcissism. And BPD. And the abuse cycle.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnd it clicked.\n\nThis\u2026 was \u2026. Abuse.  7 years and I didn\u2019t realize. Or maybe I did, and it just wasn\u2019t \u201cbad enough\u201d.  I dug my heels in, I was in denial. But I knew\u2026 I needed something. So, I planned a trip to Europe by myself, even planned for family to babysit so the nex wouldn\u2019t have to lift a finger.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHe took an absolute shit fit. Apparently a few days away was abandoning the family.\n\nThat was the last straw. I went anyway. When I got back, I got ignored for weeks. So, I started planning. I saved. I got my ducks in a row. I got a lawyer. It took several years. When I finally got the courage to pull the plug, I made sure family was there so I would be safe. He went ballistic and suicidal at once.  I\u2019ll make the story short here as I am creating an epic document \u2013 months of suicide threats, him living in the basement, attempts at hoovering, promises to change (which I\u2019ve gotten before, empty, always empty \u2013 just like the apologies) lawyers, terrifyingly horrible custody fight. A fight that I won.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI took the kids, and I moved them away. I now live with my family who are miracles, they helped me fund my entire fight for custody \u2013 I would be on the street broke without them. I got into university; I have a perfect GPA. I plan on going to med school afterwards.  After all the shit I\u2019ve been through\u2026 I think I\u2019d like to spend my life helping people. I even found an amazing, wonderful, supportive boyfriend. I am\u2026 happy. So happy. I\u2019ve changed my entire life.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI\u2019m not NC because of the kids, but close enough.

Yelling gives me panic attacks. If I hear a door slam it instantly triggers that \u2018fight or flight\u2019 response. I have very few fucks to give over trivial bullshit drama, I can\u2019t handle it.  But\u2026 I love my life though. I\u2019m so happy. My kids are happy. I wake up smiling. I never panic when I hear the back door open. I am free to make my own decisions again. It was worth it. So, so worth it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nPlease, please leave your abuser. You can be happy.

Yes, I'm going to be looking for a new one but I have to wait to transfer my kids as well. It's just not a good place in general.", "author": "werat22", "self_text": "I'm sorry for the long story to make sense of my questions. I'll make it as short as possible.\n\nThe minute I was born my life was abuse. No lie or exaggerating, my bio mother suffered from schizophrenia, drug addiction, multiple personalities, child abuse themselves, and she was homeless, did anything for drugs, and was a lady of the night so to speak. Her mother was the same minus the drugs and homelessness and work choice. She had dementia and was super religious instead. \n\nMy bio mom dated the worse guy (her pimp) even that hated she had a kid and decided I work too or she gets rid of me. My first five years went back and forth between her working me or trying to abandon me or me taking care of her like I was the mom, it depended on which personality she was. One personality would try to kill me and thankfully I was smart enough to trick her to think I was dead. I have a few good memories with her.\n\nHer mom, when I was abandoned at her place and not strangers or back alleys or stores, would force me to sit in the same spot on the couch on top of plastic, and was not allowed to moved. If I moved, I would get beat so badly. No I was not allowed to use the bathroom or eat, hence the plastic. I had to listen to her constant rambles about how I was Satan's child and I was selfish for being born and I should have died inside of her daughter. I literally sleep, peed, and lived on that one couch cushion and I hate the color orange because of it. Orange makes me sick. She had some nice moments I remember and I would be allowed to eat crackers and milk with her and she tell me a story but those moments usually only lasted an hour or so. Those few nice moments are the only reason I never died in her care. Her beatings were so bad, I would have gladly died on that couch cushion instead of sneaking to get water or food.\n\nShe had two kids with the pimp guy and the last kid that born was the reason we were finally under watch by the social workers. All the other times they were called (when she would tried to leave me in stores) I just kinda slipped under their fingers but hell, I guess a newborn and baby in the family made all the difference. Even with the state help and getting a place to live, she still couldn't handle having kids and we were taking away. I went through the foster system rather shortly because my newborn sister was in high demand and with that being said a family that didn't want to be on the waiting list for a baby girl got to skip the list by adopting all three of us. \n\nThey did not want me. They made it known and abused me my whole life, mentally, emotionally, physically, and sexually and they got away with it because they always just said it was just me being confused from what my bio mom. Trust me, their abuse was so much different than hers and it was worse. They were heavy on the mental and emotional abuse. They had a son of their own that was older than me and it took me until recently to realize that they worked so hard to make me feel so inferior and useless and like a screw up because I actually had more talent drawing than him, if I had a loving home I could have gone far and soared, and I was actually smarter than him. I got As and Bs in school without trying at all. Like if I actually tried in school growing up, I would have left with a 4.0 gpa but I was so busy being in trouble at home for no reason, yelled at all the time, put down, told I couldn't be anything but a prostitute when I grow up, not to even think about college, and bullied badly at school that I didn't. \n\nYes, I have mental illnesses, BPD, Bipolar, Manic Depression, PTSD, Anxiety/Panic Attacks, Suicidal Thoughts (I don't act of them just wish my brain would stop telling me to because it's so tiring to fight all the time), ADHD/ADD, and I am also gender fluid. I don't do anger. At least it takes a lot to get me angry but when I do get angry I usually turn it on myself. \n\nI'm in my 30s now and my adulthood, I was kicked out when I was 18 (was told this was happening when I was 10), was in abuse too from the father of my kids. I got free from him when I was 27 and am now when a great person who is good to me. I went through college and therapy and I got two degrees and even a cosmetology license but at the end of college, last semester, I developed an autoimmune disorder. They said it's chronic hives but I think it's that and more but that's whole other can of worms. \n\nMy fiance has been frustrated that I can't find work (my therapy wants me to go on disability but I've not tried because I feel like that would be failing my family) other than my minimum wage 4 hrs a week unless I get called in job and I'm not working in what I went to school for but here's the thing and this is where the part of the question really comes into play, I didn't want to do cosmetology but I like coloring my own hair or friends hair or doing nails on the occasion but it's totally hobby when I identify as a girl, yes my personality changes with my gender, but I've been trained to listen to others not myself. My own voice in my head dies when others speak and yes I lose my wants when others speak theirs for me. How can I make my voice louder and not lose it? How can I keep myself together when others get frustrated with me and I don't lose my voice to please others?\n\nMy fiance didn't really understand this and I'm really bad at communicating so we had a rough patch as all relationships tend to have at one point and I wound up going to school for it to make him happy. Three months in the year program I said I wanted to quit, I couldn't do this and they said, well, you owe us all the money anyway so you still have to pay for the course. I finished it because I wasn't going to be in debt with nothing for it. Screw that. So yeah I have a cosmetology license and I can't stand that world. It really holds me back on resumes though.\n\nMy college degrees was in DAT but my meds that take for my autoimmune suppress my imagination quite a bit so drawing and designing has gotten harder. During college, all my homework had to be on the computer and my free time was spent on a game that helped me release my anger and stress. My fiance started nick picking at my playing that game all the time. Why just that game, there's others games too. He never plays the same game for long but I can stick to a game weirdly enough with my ADHD/ADD. House needs to get cleaned (my house wasn't that bad for three kids and an adult all with ADHD and honestly, I'm proud that it stays as clean as it does. I can't help my neighbors from hell though. My fiance wants a house like only adults leave in it, not three kids, youngest 11 now but not then. He was an only child with three adults pretty much so we come from totally different backgrounds). Kids need to be watch. \n\nNow yes, some days did get bad, on my really bad days but honestly, my bad days are just that, bad days. Doesn't matter what I'm doing, nothing in the house is going to get done because I don't have the mental strength to go into \"battle\" with my kids to make them do their chores when their bio father teaches them not to respect me. He totally blamed the game and not seeing the mental illnesses and just heard excuses as he likes to say so I stopped playing. The game gives me bad anxiety and now all pretty much all my games do because every time I played any game pretty much I got a why do you play that when you can this instead. I'm literally down to a few games that a play here and there barely and Pokemon Go that play outside with my friends.\n\nLast semester of school I spent all my time on the computer pretty much doing only homework because I literally didn't have time to do anything else if I wanted to and so the house got bad that semester but seriously, I had art project after art project for four classes to pull out my butt every week and no one helping me at home pretty much and an autoimmune developing that no one knew what the hell was going on. So he pointed out that I was still on computer all the time and the house was falling apart and nothing was getting done so now I have anxiety being on a computer. I'm on my phone right now fyi. Too bad now that I think about it, he didn't nick pick my illness I was getting and maybe that would have made it go away...\n\nI've been trained to avoid negative things immediately that cause distress in myself or others around me or else I wouldn't have survived my mom or her mom, my step parents, or the father of kids. It's not an excuse. I hate that he calls it an excuse or says it sounds like an excuse even though he tries really hard to be nice about it. I know he's trying to help me but he's not a professional and he hasn't lived it or suffers it. He sent me here actually hoping I could find some answers. \n\nSo how can I get jobs that require computer usage when being on them gives me a panic attacks because now my fiance has associated with them bad. How can I undo this training that I lived with for my enter life? Once my brain sees something bad, it gets locked in. I've stopped reading subject types or watching certain genres of shows because of the father of kid. I don't like shopping certain places because of people. So many things I just don't do anymore because it's now bad and gives anxiety. Normal grounding techniques don't work for me, I've been through a lot of different ones. Only thing that helps it from getting worse is the word safe and I'm telling myself I'm safe and my therapist and me found this out by accident when I was having a panic attack in her room. How have you learn to unassociate things? How have you learned to undo you're very nature? How do you explain to someone who doesn't struggle daily with all of this in their head why simple tasks aren't simple and it's not always just about making new habits? A legit broken organ is not a bad habit but how do you live with it so it doesn't hold you back anymore?", "subreddit": "survivorsofabuse"}

We've also dealt with some serious life stressors. We both work, contribute equally to joint household bills but he takes care of more housework because I commute two hours a day &amp; I'm not home as much. \n\n\nTo give some background, we met at 20, got pregnant, got married. Our wedding was a sham. We got married in my parents kitchen with only my mom and sister in attendance, my dad didn't bother to come. We didn't invite anyone else. My parents were so ashamed that I got pregnant out of wedlock and dropped out of college (they're not religious but it made them look bad) that my mom didn't admit to anyone that she had a grandchild until after I was married. We had another child 5 years later. \n\n\nMy husband has always been emotionally distant and withholds affection. I started off very clingy because I was desperately seeking approval and love but shut down after some years and have learned to put some distance and boundaries between us for my own mental health. He has struggled with a variety of addictions during our time together and has been emotionally abusive and at times physically as well. We had a lot of knock-down, drag-out fights early on but we both have matured and have more constructive arguments now. Still not a healthy relationship. \n\n\nMy current dilemma is this: his brother is getting married this fall, my husband is a groomsman and our daughter is the flowergirl. This requires my husband to travel out of state for the bachelors party plus all of us to go up there for the wedding. My husband really tried to discourage me from going at first. Then said he didn't care if I went or not. Then he realized if I didn't go, he wasn't going to be able to get shitfaced because he would have to watch the kids, so then we decided I'll go. \n\n\nHowever I've changed my mind and decided I would stay home. Truthfully, it's because I'm bitter and incredibly hurt that I never got to have a somewhat decent wedding. I've never had anyone care about me enough to celebrate anything in my entire life. Not our wedding, no bachelorette party, never had a baby shower, never had a birthday where it wasn't treated like a huge inconvenience for my parents or where my sister didn't get half as many presents as I did. My husband usually picks big fights before any birthday, anniversary or Christmas so we normally don't do anything for each other. Never been on vacation together except we went somewhere overnight alone without kids once (even then my parents watched the kids and gave me a hard time about it). But he seems perfectly fine with spending thousands of dollars and traveling for two weeks total to celebrate his brother's wedding. \n\n\n I am horribly selfish for feeling this way. I know it's not rational. I am happy for my brother in law and his fiancee, they're a cute couple and seem very happy together. But I also know myself well enough that I will spend the entirety of his wedding fighting back tears as I am right now and I don't want to ruin their special day. I already messaged the fiancee and let her know I wasn't going to be able to come (just said it was due to work) and she didn't seem to care at all.\n\n\nI can tell he's upset with me and we're barely talking. I've pretty much completely shut down and giving him a cold shoulder. Am I being emotionally abusive or am I just asserting a boundary and trying to be kind to myself?

I wish my dads drinking bothered him like it bothered everyone else around him. I'm really angry and sad and i have no one to talk to and get this off my chest. My mom refuses to talk about it because she doesn't want to address it. My mom and dad are both selfish in regards to this situation. Every time i try to talk about it with my mom afterwards, all of a sudden its an \u201cadult situation\u201d and she doesn't want me to have to \u201cdeal with it\u201d. I'm in it. It's been my fucking problem and in my face my whole life. Its selfish and unfair and fucking insulting to say that, to act as if all of a sudden you're being morally just and all of a sudden it's not my problem anymore. She said if this ever happened again she would make him pack up and leave. The only main outcomes are: 1) she makes him leave. 2) she justifies it somehow like she always does and things continue as they always have. Either way will suck, but it will honestly suck a multitude more if its the latter. It's like, what is he gonna have to do to himself and everyone around him for you to draw the line? Is 16 years of you coddling him and him hiring everyone else around him and himself with no progress not enough? I do know my dad is manipulative but I don't know if the relationship is considered abusive. I know for sure it's unhealthy. My dad could not function the way he is now if he were to be alone. I feel fucking terrible for my mom, it's like she has three kids in the house. Genuinely I don't know what my dad is bringing to the relationship. My mom is giving 95% and my dad is giving 5%. I just don't get it, because even if you take away the alcoholism he's still a fucking unlikable borderline abusive person. Your conception of love is what you observed as a kid, and i know my mom didn't have a good or stable example of love as a child. Most males in her life were/are alcoholics. It explains why shes codependent on him. She has always put on a front of being tough and wont take any shit, I bought this as a kid. More recently really I realized how to be blunt weak she is. She lets him walk all over her. She has a low self esteem. I get it. There's just this running theme with my mom of \u201cwhen is it gonna be enough for you to draw the line?\u201d. My dads drinking, my mental health. There's simply a pervasive disregard for mental health in the house. I wish she would recognise that she doesn't need him. I just feel hopeless. My sisters starting to pick up on my dad drinking and issues between my parents, its relatively heartbreaking.", "subreddit": "emotionalabuse"}

As an example, if I was a male and my name was Johnathan, more than likely I would go by John. (More than likely, I get there are those of you out there that prefer to go by Johnathan, don\u2019t kill me Reddit haha. I love you guys)\n\nAnyway, when we first started seeing each other he would call me by my full name, knowing everyone else we knew in common called me by the shortened version and that I also referred to myself as that, introduced my self as that, etc. I asked him several times to call me the shortened version explaining only strangers and my parents when I was in trouble as a child called me by my full name. He refused. He said he didn\u2019t see me as the shortened version and would keep using the full version. Too bad. When introducing me to new people, he always used the full version.\n\nLooking back, I see now that was one of the first red flags. (The first was him telling me he loved me on day one). It was his first way to assert dominance and test my boundaries. I allowed it. I allowed him to control how I identified myself for over a year. Scary. \n\nScary because I am not a weak or easily controllable person. I know the popular theory is they pick people with low self esteem, childhood trauma, co-dependent personalities, etc. I am the opposite. Confident, self sufficient, great childhood, loving friendships and relationships and support system, and am a very well respected engineer and manager in a male dominated field. I\u2019m not a kid.

{"post_id": "bf3q91", "created_utc": 1555704746, "title": "Signs that you've been abused by a narcissist. A great resource on the sidebar. Website: \"Life After Narcissistic Abuse\"", "author": "HappyTweety5000", "self_text": "1. YOU DOUBT YOURSELF\n\nDo you recognize that you\u2019re doubting yourself more than you ever have before?\n\nVictims of narcissistic abuse often appear uncertain of themselves, constantly seeking clarification that they haven\u2019t made a mistake or misheard something.\n\nThis reactive adaptation to narcissistic abuse is because the narcissist is ALWAYS finger pointing and shifting blame to YOU for ALL of the ups &amp; downs both in the relationship AND in the narcissist\u2019s personal psyche.\n\nBecause this relationship has NON EXISTENT boundaries, you will find YOURSELF constantly PUT UPON and FORCED to accept responsibility for things you didn\u2019t do or say. This borrowed humiliation and shame is exactly what the narcissist intends for the victim to take from the narcissist. Their own unfelt core of shame. \n\n2. CONFUSION\n\nJust refer to the above explanation of self doubt and boundary transgression if you want to understand the CONFUSION that is part and parcel of narcissistic abuse.\n\nDaily boundary transgression and criss crossing of responsibility starts to wear on even the clearest minded of targets.\nSuddenly you wake up and realize that all the realities and borders between yourself and others is not only BLURRED but MISSING.\n\nIt\u2019s confusing to KNOW that you aren\u2019t responsible for someone else\u2019s behavior, thinking and feeling but to be CONSTANTLY SCOLDED for behaving, thinking and feeling as if you ARE.\n\nIt\u2019s crazy-making and a narcissist purposefully causes this confusion. They know that a divided and conquered mind is their most vulnerable and susceptible target who won\u2019t be able to identify that their confusion is caused by an abusive technique called \u2018gaslighting\u2019.\n\nGaslighting is a technique of psychological abuse used by narcissists to instill confusion and anxiety in their target to the point where they no longer trust their own memory, perception or judgment.  With gas lighting, the target initially notices that something happens that is odd, but they don\u2019t believe it.  \n\nThe target attempts to fight the manipulation, but are confused further by being called names or told that they\u2019re: \u2018Just Too sensitive\u2019, \u2018Crazy\u2019, \u2018Imagining things\u2019 or the narcissist  flat out DENIES ever saying anything hurtful. Gradually, the target learns not to trust their own perceptions and begins doubting themselves.  \n\nBroken and unable to trust themselves, they isolate further. The target now doubts everything about themselves: their thoughts and opinions, their ideas and ideals. They become dependent on the narcissist for their reality.\n\nFor it is in your CONFUSION and acceptance of responsibility that belongs to the narcissist, that a narcissist is able to successfully CONTROL YOU and USE YOU as a scapegoat for their problems.\n\n3. FEELING CRAZY\n\nEvery minute of every hour of every day of every year, a Narcissist, who has a DSM classifiable personality DISORDER (ie: not playing with a full deck) is PROJECTING their disorder onto those around them. If you don\u2019t think that having a crazy person constantly blaming you for being \u201ccrazy\u201d will make you crazy, I\u2019d like to introduce you to a narcissist that will convince you otherwise.\n\nThis disorder isn\u2019t a relationship gone wrong. This disorder isn\u2019t kid stuff. It\u2019s MALEVOLENT. It\u2019s a transference of malevolence and MENTAL DISORDER from the person who has it to the person who DOESN\u2019T.\n\nFrankly, before a narcissist, I\u2019ve not once in my life, FELT CRAZY. Neither have I ever been told by a psychologist and I\u2019ve seen lots of them \u2013 that I had anything WRONG with MY own MENTAL HEALTH. Personally, I always had it \u201ctogether\u201d. I was resilient, mentally tough, and withstood many events in my life that would make others crumble.\n\nYet, when I unwittingly dated someone with this serious mental health malady, I wanted to slam an entire set of broken porcelain down his throat sideways and every obtuse moron that believes the garbage that comes out of his mouth. No, it\u2019s not that I suddenly became a person interested in physical violence, I suddenly became a person who was witnessing a DSM category all wrapped up into a physical being \u2013 who turned his mental health problems ON Me. \n\nI became a target of a person with a problem. They say, \u201cHurt people, HURT people\u201d. I say, \u201cNarcissistic People DESTROY PEOPLE\u201d.\n\n4. EMERGING CLUSTER OF SYMPTOMS THAT HAVE NO OTHER EXPLANATION\n\nAll I could muster to the narcissist in my dear john letter when I broke up with him that wonderful New Year\u2019s Eve, was \u201cI DONT KNOW what\u2019s WRONG!! But I just don\u2019t feel like myself. Something feels EXTREMELY TOXIC and I don\u2019t know why\u201d\u2026..This should be the alert when a victim of narcissistic abuse presents themselves to therapists. The inexplicable \u201ccomplaint\u201d.\n\nMy first visit to my therapist were those words exactly. \u201cI don\u2019t know what\u2019s wrong with me, but It\u2019s SERIOUS!\u201d I felt it. I did \u2013 I felt BEWILDERED inside, but I could not articulate what it was. (another red flag for someone usually able to articulate every feeling and explanation about myself in-depth). \n\nHow was it that after 43 years of explaining, analyzing and discussing my own deficiencies quite well, I could NOT for the life of me explain to my therapist what was so \u201cwrong\u201d with me that it was palpable. His answer, set me free, it really did. \n\n\u201cYOU HAVE BEEN IN A DOMESTICALLY VIOLENT RELATIONSHIP WITH A NARCISSIST \u201c\n\nMy therapist had some background with this person. He\u2019d WITNESSED the narcissist calling me, berating me during sessions. I held the phone away during one session, so that my therapist could hear the narcissist on the other end questioning me about cheating, \u201cAccusing me of having an affair with the therapist\u201d.  \n\nGrilling me about what the therapist looked like and would speak to me like. He even accused the therapist of wanting me sexually and that was the reason the therapist spoke so lowly of the narcissist. (of course it couldn\u2019t just be that the narcissist had a bad reputation and the community was on to him)\n\nSufferers report that their spark has gone out and, even years later, find they just cannot get motivated about anything.\n\nUnaware that we\u2019ve been living in a war zone with a tyrannical narcissist, we can\u2019t quite grasp the words to articulate the abuse, yet at the same time, we VERY MUCH FEEL IT. We present ourselves to the mental health community, incapable of speaking about an abuse we yet know nothing about. \n\nUntil that word, \u201cNARCISSISTIC ABUSE\u201d is given to us, we have NO IDEA that is what\u2019s causing our pain. That\u2019s why it\u2019s SO IMPORTANT to get the word out there, what narcissists look like, their modus operandi, the words and phrases they use, so that when a victim of their abuse begins looking for answers, they quickly will be able to identify that they are involved with a narcissist.\n\nIn Narcissistic Victim Syndrome you are looking for a cluster of symptoms to emerge many are the symptoms of trauma (avoidance, loss of interest, feeling detached, sense of a limited future, sleeping or eating difficulties and nightmares, irritability, hyper-vigilance, easily startled, flashbacks, hopelessness, psychosomatic illnesses, self-harming, thoughts of suicide etc). \n\nSome victims develop Stockholm Syndrome and want to support, defend, and love the abuser despite what they have gone through.\n\n5. DISSOCIATION\n\nVictims tend to \u2018dissociate\u2019 or detach from their emotions, body, or surroundings. Living in a war zone where all forms of power and control are used against you (intimidation; emotional, physical and mental abuse; isolation, economic abuse, sexual abuse, coercion, control etc), the threat of abuse is always present. Dissociation is an automatic coping mechanism against overwhelming stress.\n\nSymptoms of dissociation resulting from trauma may include depersonalization, (disconnecting your body awareness from your physical self) psychological numbing, disengaged from life and passions, or amnesia regarding the events of the abuse.\n\nIt has been hypothesized that dissociation may provide a temporarily effective defense mechanism in cases of severe trauma; however, in the long-term, dissociation is associated with decreased psychological functioning and adjustment.\n\nOther symptoms sometimes found along with dissociation in victims of traumatic abuse (often referred to as \u201csequelae to abuse\u201d) include anxiety, PTSD, low self-esteem, somatization, depression, chronic pain, interpersonal dysfunction, substance abuse, self-mutilation and suicidal ideation or actions. These symptoms may lead the victim to erroneously present the symptoms as the source of the problem.\n\n6. PTSD\n\nLet\u2019s face it. If I didn\u2019t mention PTSD, or Complex PTSD, I would NOT be doing the topic of narcissistic abuse syndrome ANY justice.\n\nPtsd, in layman\u2019s terms? From a fellow sufferer? A Cerebral anxiety attack that makes your whole body come alive with PALPABLE FEAR. The rapid heart beat, the intrusive and spinning thoughts and fears \u2013 just like the abuse is CURRENTLY HAPPENING SEQUENTIALLY ALL OVER AGAIN. \n\nThis is called RE-LIVING. It\u2019s as if the traumatic abuse event is occurring in the present tense. All the emotions of fear, shame, shrinking, wincing, looking over your shoulder &amp; walking on eggshells waiting to be attacked ruthlessly AGAIN.     \n\nPhysical numbness \u2013\n\n(toes, fingertips, lips) is common, as is emotional numbness (especially inability to feel joy).\n\nAvoidance \u2013\n\nof places, sounds, tastes, and songs that remind them of their abuser or the abuse. Intense feelings of anxiety even in anticipation of having to revisit the memories.\n\nMemory Loss \u2013 \n\nAlmost all targets report impaired memory. Partially due to conscious avoidance as well as from the damage done to the hippocampus, an area of the brain linked to learning and memory.\n\nNeed for solitude / tendency to isolate \u2013\n\nWe\u2019re EXHAUSTED after narcissistic abuse. Feelings of withdrawal and isolation are common; we just want to be in our own head for a while, find our own answers; thus, solitude is sought.\n\nLack of Joy and Hope \u2013\n\nInability to feel joy (anhedonia) and deadening of loving feelings towards others are commonly reported. One fears never being able to feel love or trust again.\n\nThe target becomes very gloomy and senses a foreshortened future sometimes with justification. Many targets ultimately have severe psychiatric injury, severely impaired health and/or stress related illnesses.\n\nSleeplessness-\n\nMelatonin became my new best friend after narcissistic abuse. The nightmares and night terrors can be overwhelming that good restorative sleep becomes impossible.  Napping became my new favorite passion.\n\nSleep becomes almost impossible, despite the constant fatigue; such sleep as is obtained tends to be unsatisfying, unrefreshing and non-restorative. On waking, the person often feels more tired than when they went to bed. Depressive feelings arrive very early in the morning, making falling back to sleep an impossibility.  \n\nFeelings of vulnerability and loneliness may be heightened overnight.\n\nAnxiousness, Guilt &amp; Disturbing thoughts \u2013 \n\nTargets have an extremely short fuse and are easily irritated. The person frequently experiences obsessive visions of violence happening to the narcissist  hoping for an accident for, or murdering the narcissist; the resultant feelings of guilt further limit progress in healing.\n\nFight or Flight Response \u2013 \n\nWith your system on alert for ever-present danger in the environment it\u2019s easy to react sensitively to sudden changes \u2013 causing the startle response.\n\nAwareness of symptoms \u2013 \n\nIt\u2019s very harrowing to realize that you are different from you were before the narcissist; FUNDAMENTALLY DIFFERENT. When you are very aware that PTSD has replaced the narcissist, it emotionally drains the target of any hope for being PERMANENTLY NARCISSISTIC FREE. We don\u2019t want to be constantly reminded and aware of the person we escaped. We want to live freely, however symptoms, are a constant reminder that we DON\u2019T. \n\nSource: Check out all the resources on the side bar.

When we first met we did so as just potential friends, without nothing more going on. She was clear to point out she had recently gotten out of a relationship and wasn't looking for anything, and she'd never been the \"casual sex\" or FWB type of girl.\n\nWe made small talk and followed each other on insta and that was it, until around December of this year. We slowly started getting closer and closer and getting more and more flirty, in a very romantic way which I do appreciate. We talked about it and decided to not make it official until we were together again physically (she lives in a nearby town, about 3 hrs. from me), but we chose to stay \"exclusive\" from that point on.\n\nThe next couple weeks were fantastic, we texted all day and talked on the phone nearly every night. She asked a lot about my life and I about hers. She told me she was eager to be with me and me meeting her family and assured me that 3 hrs isn't even that far away (I've never been in a long distance relationship before). She sent me photos everyday and I felt on top of the world. I decided then that I was gonna tackle this relationship with all my heart, as I've been insecure and guarded in the past and have been recently diagnosed with depression and anxiety issues. I chose to give her my soul. \n\nAround another couple weeks later she started being less communicative, citing being busy and other commitments. We literally made plans to see each other (either me going to visit or she coming down), and every time something happened that prevented her from us seeing each other. She slowly started posting very ambiguous things on her IG, and asking things like \"are you a jealous guy?\". I've never considered myself jealous but I asked her why, and she responded there was nothing to worry about but she had a lot of guy friends and sometimes they were very affectionate in her social media. \n\nI told her I completely trusted her as long as she told me they were nothing more but friends. She told me not to worry but her IG posts/stories started growing more ambiguous. One day she was particularly cutting and dry in her texts and told me she had plans for later. I asked her if she was going out with coworkers and she told me \"no it's people I know outside of work\". A couple hours later she posted a story photo of a guy with the caption \"the boy\" and right after one of her captioned \"the girl\". \n\nI waited until that evening to quiet my thoughts and not say anything out of place and later that night she assured me it was only a friend and that I shouldn't be so controlling and she didn't have any reason to give any explanations to me. I apologized and just asked her to be straight and honest with me and I was willing to trust her no matter what.\n\nAll of that activity has continued and we haven't seen each other since. Right now she went on vacation to see one of her friends to another town and she's coming back down on monday, but a couple weeks ago I tried ending the relationship due to me started getting worse, her not \"having time\" to talk or text or anything with me and not wanting to address the situation. I wrote her a lot of stuff that evening and apologized for giving up but it was clear she either had no time or decided against making adjustments for us to work out.\n\nShe called me straight away (after telling me \"tonight's not a good night, I'm busy with my parents and I can't talk on the phone, we'll talk tomorrow\") and asked what was going on. She said \"you don't have to say all those things we're doing fine\", and I told her I wasn't doing fine, she said she was just giving me space to gather my thoughts and I told her, I didn't want space, I wanted to fix it and be all good again.\n\nWe've only spoken a couple times since then with her sometimes telling me nice things and other times not even responding to my texts. What gets me the most is all those things she's said before about putting in effort and how she wants me to get better (depression and anxiety) she's even told me she loves me and again and again that she's with me and wants to be with me, yet when there's a chance for her to actually back those words, there's always something else.\n\nWhenever she has plans with her friends or whatever, it all goes according, but she either has no time for me, has chosen to make no time for me, or I am just another guy she toys with. Either way, I think this belongs here and reading a lot of the articles and posts here resounds with me as I'm constantly told how I'm being dramatic, how I am not patient, how I've pushed her away and most importantly, whenever I try to stay calm and tell her what I think is wrong I am met with dismissiveness and indifference.\n\nShe's broken my heart and we haven't even \"broken up\" yet. I'm not sure if she'll even try to meet when she's in town because last time I texted her she never even replied. \n\nThanks for reading if you got this far, as I said, I just found this subreddit and it all clicks. Any advice I will appreciate and even writing all this has felt therapeutic. Thanks guys.", "subreddit": "NarcissisticAbuse"}

He was probably grooming someone else - makes sense given how quickly he moved on after me (:()\n\nBut how do I know he really wasn\u2019t just emotionally checking out?

There are so many things happening all at once and I feel like a total wreck trying to process it at all. I\u2019m venting a little for context so skip to the last few paragraphs if it\u2019s too much to read. Without going into great detail because it\u2019s a lot of different things, we recently had a scare in which it seemed like my mother\u2019s stalker who sexually assaulted and nearly killed her 20 years ago found her (my parents\u2019 divorce was finalized and she recently changed back to her maiden name which he knew her by). Things are still up in the air with that but we now have some reason to think it was a false alarm. On top of that, my grandma was admitted to the hospital this week and is very, very sick and we are not sure how things are going to go. I\u2019m terrified. She is the only grandparent I have left that has not disowned me after I came out as gay and has loved and accepted me anyway. I have so much guilt because I have been terrible about not visiting her often after I met my nex. I got sucked up into my own little world and instead of visiting her multiple times a week like I used to, I started seeing her every few months. And I\u2019ve continued to do so after discard and I can\u2019t make a valid excuse for that other than because I\u2019ve been isolating myself and too exhausted to go anywhere. But she\u2019s my grandma. I\u2019m so mad at myself for not taking the time for her and I pray to god she\u2019s going to be okay so I can do better. She knows I love her and my brother and I are the only grandchildren she is close to, but I know I\u2019ve done a terrible job of showing that lately. My mom has been with her all day at the hospital while I was at work. She\u2019s sleeping a lot but when she was up she said to my mom, \u201cI know X\u2019s birthday is next week, I want to give her some money.\u201d The fact that she even thought of that, while she is so sick. I don\u2019t deserve that, and for her to even say that shows how much she loves me and I feel awful for not being there these last few years. I don\u2019t want anything, I just want her to be okay. \n\nThere are so many other things that pale in comparison to this that are still stressing me out, but between all of it I can\u2019t remember the last time I\u2019ve been this stressed and exhausted and overwhelmed. Probably not since the couple months after discard last year. But this time I\u2019m worried about so many other things besides my divorce and I\u2019m lonely and scared and I miss the comfort of having someone there. By this, I mean my soon-to-be-nex wife and another narc that I recently had a short 4 month \u201crelationship\u201d with. I know it wasn\u2019t real. I realized that long, long ago with my ex wife. I just miss the illusion of both of them being there - that illusion of feeling safe and protected and that no matter what happens, everything would be okay because she\u2019d protect me. That nothing could destroy me and that I was safe because she was cold and numb and nothing in this world seemed to scare her and she\u2019d keep me safe. That if I fall she\u2019d be there to catch me. Which was all an illusion. But both of my exes played the part so well and I miss that comfort, however fake it was. \n\nI should be able to give that feeling of safety and security to myself, to find comfort in my own strength. Or to accept that yes, everything is scary right now, and I have no idea what will happen, but I don\u2019t need a security blanket. I have myself. But alas, I can\u2019t bring myself to do those things, it\u2019s something I\u2019m still working hard on and never really learned how to do growing up with narc parents. In the meantime it\u2019s so hard to not miss my ex and hang on to those little moments, the calm between the storms that used to happen before the mask came off. \n\nI could never text my ex-wife. She is cold and evil and has no soul and this divorce has been a nightmare. But I do miss her, the \u201cher\u201d that she was when her mask was on and the way that felt. I miss that so much and sometimes I still wonder how things got to be this ugly and terrible with the person who I thought was my best friend. \n\nBut for my most recent nex that things ended with less than 2 weeks ago, it is so fucking hard not to text her. In those short 4 months she was there through some of the serious shit going on in my life, even though it was more of a fling than a relationship. Things ended so ugly and she turned out to be a completely different person and repeat so many of the things that my nex said to me and called me. But I think of how when things were perfect and fun and it was a fun distraction and she was there to listen and how she even sent me money to help with bills (which I never asked her to do or even brought up - I was unemployed at the time and she offered out of the blue) and how it made me feel like she really cared about my well-being. How we were just friends with benefits and she still cared and listened and did that more than my nex ever did. It made me put my guard down. I think about she worried about me and checked up on me and told me to stay safe when the shit with my moms stalker started and to take care of myself and that if she knew what I was going through right now, maybe we\u2019d be able to push everything else aside because she might care and worry about me and I might have that security blanket again. And I just miss her and the messing around and our \u201cfriendship\u201d in general. I miss the distraction, because that\u2019s exactly what it was. I know I can\u2019t text her but it\u2019s so hard not to do it and to not miss her. I know she doesn\u2019t think of me at all, just like my nex-wife. She discarded so easily once I was no longer \u201cfun.\u201d \n\nThe high of it was so good. That feeling of being safe. I think about it now and I\u2019m starting to realize that my nex-wife was so fucking protective of me when it came to anyone else, even when her abuse was at an all-time-high \u2014 and it\u2019s as if it was because, in her mind, the only person that was allowed to hurt me was her. I don\u2019t really know the point of this post but I\u2019m so damn lonely and scared and I\u2019m really struggling to not send a text I\u2019ll regret right now. Someone please tell me this feeling will pass. I\u2019m trying so hard to learn to not need anyone else, especially a narc who will never value me the way that I valued them.", "subreddit": "NarcissisticAbuse"}

He is what I strongly believe to be Narcissist or sociopath, I'm not yet sure, but he put me through mental, verbal and physical turmoil in the time I uncoverd all his secrets.  Back in November of 2018, I made a post about how I've been with this guy who was, oh so charming in the beginning.  He sold me so many dreams and had such a way about him that captivated me and I was love blind.  Blind to now what I see were red flags and strange behaviors like he was testing to see how far he could  push me and then reel me back in.\n\n It was always the silent treatment and me apologizing even if it was him who kept breaking his promises.  Somehow he always knew what to say to make me stay and think he was really trying to communicate and be understanding.\n  Anyway, our first 4 years were relatively good and we didn't have that many issues except some signs I overlooked that I now see as abnormal.  But the real problems began when we moved some hours away.  He went from a secure manager position to entry level jobs that didn't always provide steady income. Financially we were suffering and he was lieing about going in to his jobs or saying there wasn't work that day.\n  Meanwhile, I'm working two jobs 7 days a week while he \"gets himself together\" I'm frustrated and burnt out after working the two jobs for 10 months while he's coming home early and smoking weed... Why I put up with his crap for so long I'll never know.  But I know I loved him or I thought I did, so much that I was in denial about his lies. \n  I really loved him and I can't say now that in our 6 years he really did anything for me or \"us\".  It's embarrassing how blind I was and I NEVER would have suspected him cheating... Mostly because he emohasized so much about his love for me and he'd never think about another woman because I'm so great. Apparently I am great if I'm busting my ass while he's couch surfing.\n \nI always knew when he lied about going to work because obviously his pay stub showed his hours and he pretty much gave me what he had for bills.  Which brings me to my next wtf moment when I stumbled across pages and pages of texts (and mostly all texts) to escorts!  I mean, texting from 5am all the way up to 11pm literally all day (on days he should have been working).  The logs went back to as far as when we moved about 2 years!  Not every day though, a month would go by with no text, but then start again going all day. \nI was shocked and mortified, especially since this is the man that told me he didn't even watch porn (my ex had a porn addiction). \nI don't understand if he's texting all day and not seeing them?  but obviously they're not texting all day for free but the money just wasn't there.  These were high end escorts too with an agency and with us barely having enough for gas, it just didn't make sense.  \n\nHis response though, completely caught me off guard...and it's shameful on my part that I stayed after.  He went into a violent rage, kicking me, slapping me and throwing me around, throwing me on the ground and yelling how could I possibly think he would do anything like pay for a prostitute?!  How dare I accuse him.  I pleaded with him to stop, that I had only found these numbers in (my AT&amp;T account). \nWhat else would I think? \nAfter his rage and my bewilderment and shock, he calmed and went into his \"normal\" self and began explaining how he's been working with the neighbor who's pimping these girls....our neighborhood is scummy like that and the city was a large human trafficking hub before backpage was shut down so the idea of pimps is not far fetched, however his involvement is a complete shock.  \nMaybe he came up with his stories as he was physically assaulting me, but his story goes that he was letting our neighbor use his phone because the neighbor didn't want his gf to get mad that he's pimping because she doesn't approve, but I guess MY bf thought I would be all fine and dandy about it??  \nObviously, it sounds like a BS story because he can't admit it? But then how? I know he couldn't have been using these girls all this time because the money wasn't there!  \nHis response is enough in itself I know.  But the shock of the idea of all that happening and I didn't notice ANYTHING?  the betrayal still hurts so much and he is such a good manipulator (for me at least) that he's never going to admit anything and only gets defensive and angry if it's mentioned. \n\nI feel so stuck in my own mind that I can't have enough definitive proof (that he can't deny or blame on the neighbor) and yet he can still deny everything I found!  It's ridiculous and I feel like I know the truth, but I can't admit it.  There's so much more than I can write about it, but that's the gist.  I do know that he's a liar, and he can't be forgiven for what he did to me physically and emotionally and continued to do until I was able to leave. \n\nI don't know why I'm so hung up on not being able to face what he did or potentially did. But mostly I don't want to admit that I was so badly taken advantage of that while I was working every day, he was doing all this and I didn't see it. I did love him, stupidly.

While I eventually realized his behavior towards me was perfectly in line with classic narcissistic abuse, there were still a few physical/behavioral tics he had which were very perplexing and to this day I am at a loss for an explanation. These traits included:\n\n\\- He had certain nonsense words or phrases he would repeat at random (such as \"cho-lu-la\" or \"crack baby!\"), chuckled to himself for seemingly no reason, and would make strange humming or grunting noises\n\n\\- He occasionally expressed affection(?) by licking my hand or using my hand to rub his face\n\n\\- Kissing him was like kissing a mannequin, and when it came to intimacy... he was just terrible in bed. It was as though he had no sense of coordination or rhythm. \n\n\\- He had a rather clumsy, lumbering gait when he walked\n\n\\- He largely avoided eye contact with people, and the few times he did make eye contact he had a very haunting, unsettling stare. \n\nListing all these makes me question myself again, as I do believe I had valid reasons for believing he was autistic, but the narcissistic behavior was definitely there too (from love bombing me in the beginning, refusing to answer yes or no questions, telling me that his favorite thing about me was simply the fact that I'm \"available\", talking over and ignoring me, ghosting me at random for days or weeks at a time, making me perform degrading sex acts on him, obsessing over his music and making me pleasure him whilst listing to recordings of himself playing guitar and singing, treating me like an object, etc.) It's worth mentioning that he also seemed to have a drinking/substance abuse problem, but he was secretive about it. He was extremely reclusive and reserved around other people so these are behaviors I mostly observed in private. Overall he tried to surround himself with an air of mystery and kept his cards close. His private life was bizarre and incomprehensible, and I think I put up with his abuse for so long simply because I wanted if not needed to figure him out. \n\nAnyway, if I were to presume that he is a narcissist and nothing more, I wonder if there are any physical/behavioral traits or co-morbid disorders that cold explain these strange qualities.

So, I made a post (or maybe a couple) contemplating whether or not to email my Nex as he had me blocked everywhere else. I tried to text and message him on social media for some closure but none of it went through. I was told not to try any further and honestly that was my plan. I wasn\u2019t gonna contact him for closure or anything of the sort.\n\nThe reason I did end up calling was because I hit a low this morning due to financial issues and he was the only person I could call (he owes me $200 and it\u2019s why I\u2019m in such a bind in the first place).\n\nI called him just begging him to do the decent thing and pay me back. I\u2019m aware that it was pathetic, 100% pathetic, I showed absolutely no integrity, but it was genuinely my last option to get out of my current situation. At first he was kind of nice and seemed to understand, but then he turned really cold. He told me he never wanted to speak to me again and that he doesn\u2019t care what I\u2019m going through. He said I ruined everything for him and he doesn\u2019t trust or believe a word I\u2019ll ever have to say. I was a little shocked by this at first, but then there were moments were he seemed to want to talk to me? It was confusing because I didn\u2019t really call to talk, just to get my money back. He would make jokes or bicker with me, but in a lighthearted way. I mean he told me he should have hung up as soon as he heard my voice, but he let the call drag out for over an hour? Every time I was done talking he\u2019d ask me if there was anything more I had to say. I\u2019d say \u201cno that\u2019s it.\u201d A normal person would then say \u201cokay, goodbye,\u201d but he would drag it out asking why I didn\u2019t hang up then or telling me to just say whatever I need to now because I\u2019ll never get another chance. I took the bait because he kept pushing and asked him questions about his lies and cheating that I didn\u2019t even want to ask because I knew I wouldn\u2019t trust his answers anyway. It was just weird.\n\nI don\u2019t really care if the call fed his ego or gave him some type of supply. Like I said, it was a complete last option and I knew it was pathetic before I did it. I didn\u2019t care what he might get out of it just what I might get out of it (my money back). He did tell me that despite him wanting nothing to do with me he would pay me back, so hopefully that actually happens. I\u2019d rather have tried than not.\n\nMy question is why do I feel better after the call. He did all the narc-y things he possibly could do in that one phone call. He made himself the victim, blamed me for everything, and twisted every story, and the whole time he did it I was consciously registering it in my head. All this and I feel better? I\u2019m not sad or angry. I\u2019m content. Everyone told me I would feel awful, but I feel better (for now). Is it because I fed into the addiction?", "subreddit": "NarcissisticAbuse"}

Basically prostitution.) and posted my address there too. I eventually had to nuke my old Reddit account because she found my post regarding this matter in legal advice and I knew that was going to kick the hornets nest. \n\nIn one of my posts, I mentioned that I was going to talk to this about my therapist.

LEO said to wait a while to see if she does anything else that could put my life in danger............I qualify for a restraining order.

I was NC for a year until she made public statements saying that I'm an abusive bitch and my SO deserves better. Naturally, I unblocked her and gave her a piece of my mind and then she promptly blocked me. After that, we've been NC for about 4 months.  EDIT: I still feel stupid for attacking her in public. That made my life worse. \n\n*About the phone number: They were doctored texts, which she admitted to in a group chat (I not only presented it as evidence against her, she also admitted doing it for malicious intent).

I stayed almost 22 years. It took me 18 years to finally truly put my foot down for the first time with my Nex. (Of course it took me almost 4 more years to actually end it... part of the fool crown I now wear.) I have a stranger to thank for making that moment possible in year 18. \n\nLike most narcs mine made me feel insignificant. I was never worth the effort. He played video games rather than interact with me, until of course he got horny then suddenly he remembered I existed. He neglected his financial responsibilities, his responsibilities domestically to our family and home, neglected his responsibilities to me in our relationship and his personal responsibilities. It was usually my fault. If I yelled at him he would yell back at me about how awful I was to dare yell at him. Total double standards. Anyways, he made me feel worthless, unloved and unlovable.\n\nI knew something was wrong but I let him convince me that I was the problem. Insecure, jealous, needy, money hungry, untrusting and careless with his feelings. These are all things I was told as I begged, pleaded, cried and screamed for effort and consideration. \n\nThen one day I had to go to DMV. There were two guys working on the sidewalk. When I got out of my car I saw one guy nudge the other guy and kind of nod his head in my direction while saying something I couldn\u2019t hear. The other guy responded \u201cif there\u2019s anything I\u2019ve learned in life, it\u2019s stay away from the bombshells\u201d. So of course I look around to see who they were talking about and there was no one else on the block or anywhere near me. I couldn\u2019t believe it! They were talking about me! Now I\u2019m not a bombshell by any means. But I was always fairly secure in my appearance before my Nex mindfucked me. I always considered myself \u201cgirl next door cute\u201d.  No way was \u201cbombshell\u201d something I ever assigned to myself!  But hearing him say that gave me back so much strength. It reminded that I was a prize! I\u2019m a hard worker, loyal and honest, kind and considerate, witty and charming and not bad looking either apparently! \n\nThis random stranger reminded me I had worth. And then I realized my Nex didn\u2019t value me at all. So I went home and put my foot down. I told him to get his shit together or we were done. Of course I let him manipulate and gaslight me for another four years but I never forgot that guys words. Whenever my Nex would blame his nonsense on me I would remember that guys words and know I could do better. I would remember I had value and deserved better. \n\nSo wherever you are today, Stranger, thank you. Hearing those words when I felt so worthless and like I was a mentally abusive person gave me clarity and strength. It was the first step to me gaining my freedom. It was the first step to me figuring out I was with a narc. And most importantly it was the boost I needed to start exiting the nightmare I was living. So once again Stranger, Thank you! From the bottom of my heart! Your words were the catalyst to my freedom. I will be eternally grateful.", "subreddit": "NarcissisticAbuse"}

He also have mental problems of course, and I tried to let him know how much eating better helped me feel a healthy mind in a healthy body. Any nutritional deficiencies causes depression, especially lack of C and magnesium. Sugar like grains cause rapid blood sugar swings and therefore mood swings, and lacking B vitamins makes the brain suffocate into a confused psychosis. \n\nI do roasted ducks and a soup recipe that can cure diabetes in a week, suicidal urges in 3 days, and people used something similar to cure cancer (gerson therapy).\n\nBut he told me that he knows more about nutrition than I do. More by eating ramen,not even caring enough about food to COOK them. I read books, sites, for 10 years! Medical research was my calling in life and when I got too sick to study that long, I experimented on myself like a guinea pig. But he claims to be better than me at my specialty, while eating worse than a teenager, worse than when I was anorexic. So sure to know it all he looks down on me even for my special skill when even homeless people addicted to meth eat more carefully than he does. I wish I was exaggerating. He spend 100$ a month on food. I was beyond insulted to be belittle by such a trash when I'm so unable to find someone who's into nutrition as much as me that I'm mega lonely about it. He's not superior, he doesn't even have the basics.\n\nThe other thing is when I thought about buying myself a tablet, he replied laughing not to get one because I suck so much at tech that I'll fuck it up. I have a friend who's literally mentally retarded and she can use it without screwing it up!!! I studied web design, I can code, I'm a power user who hacks my window's registry to customize it. I never fucked up tech, I'm just not using the latest things because I'd rather eat the best to become the healthiest. He knows that I studied it, but he thinks I'm even more inept than a retard, belittling me laughing. Then he said that I can't afford it anyway. I said not to underestimate my capacity to save money. And he thinks that money is meant to be spent and is 10k in debt. It's my second specialty and he mocked me like I'm more inept than the average person who only use tech for selfies on facebook and doesn't even know basic keyboard shortcuts.\n\nAnother thing that enraged me is that he wants to start a game on dungeon and dragons, kind of a roleplaying game impro, table version of an adventure videogame. He told us to fill the character sheet all on our own without asking him questions about the book and stats he wrote. That it will help us learn better. I got angry that he just basically told us to fuck off and refused to help us. Angry that he expected me to memorize a whole book in less than an hours instead to email it to me in advance with no rush. But when I asked him a question, he couldn't remember the things he wrote himself. He pretended to do it for our own benefit, when it was to hide his own weakness.\n\nHe said that we'll just practice the mechanics of the game at first, to help us. But we all played dungeon before, and the other Master never made us practice, we just played and learned as we went. The only difference between practicing mechanics and a real game is HIM having to invent a cool story. Instead to admit that he doesn't have the mental capacity to do that, he belittled our capacity, claimed that a boring as fuck game was to help us, poor incompetents, that he's belittling us for our own good.\n\nI'm enraged and disgusted. I'm an INFJ personality type, people can't lie to me for long, because I have so much sensory inputs (pure hell) that I know when something doesn't add up. I feel looked down on and disrespected. To hide his own weakness. If he had admitted that he needs us to use the book because he doesn't even remember the stuff he wrote himself, and that he needs to start slow before inventing a cool story, no problem! But belittling me and shitting on my special skills, claiming to be superior, and doing it for my own good... Fuck you! I think he's a narc. I think I got myself in my old patterns again... I think I should run for my life. I should probably observe and gain more data, maybe this is salvageable, but the blatant disrespect isn't.\n\nHe was supposed to teach me self defense. But when I said to never grab my breasts as a \"practice\", he refused to agree. He said he doesn't know how it will go. I realized that being assertive isn't just screaming NO loud and firm enough for people to \"feel\" it. Being assertive can be as simple as removing favors for disrespectful people until there's nothing left to remove. They think they got away with it, and then the door slam happens. It's pointless to try to teach basic respect to someone who's demeaning by default! Because deep in his heart, he'll always think I'm a piece of shit no matter how good I am, because his ego is so insecure that he has to be the best at everything, and belittle people, and claim that it's out of kindness and consideration. He reminds me of my mother. I feel nothing but rage and hatred. I think my intuition is trying to tell me something. Even if I keep him around to have acquaintances, he'll damage my mind... I should bail. \n\nI welcome opinions.\n\nI don't care if I'm a drama queen. Yes I am. But a retard not even able to cook the most retarded food on the planet has no business telling me he's superior to me at nutrition. I don't care that it's a popular snack among shit poor people. I'm on welfare too, I still eat roasted duck, when it's in sale.\n\nIs he a narc or just an arrogant asshole. Hm... that sounds redundant.", "subreddit": "NarcissisticAbuse"}

If you don't want to read the whole story. In short, I had to leave my abusive mother because I was scared for my life. She has been mentally and physically abusive and after calling me a psychopath and that I will never get better I snapped and wanted to die, especially after the post I wanted to commit suicide even more so after she said she would bash my head in if she saw my room and said that it wasn't a threat and she would not be sorry for it (*paraphrased).* Since I have left I have come to realize that in actuality that what I did was the right thing for my safety. I was scared for my life and I left this behind, so she can leave me alone because I don't want her to come after me, but as you can tell by this post it does not matter. This is what I left my mother before I left:\n\nhttps://i.redd.it/evmgkkmnwht21.jpg\n\nhttps://i.redd.it/tvwzat5qwht21.jpg\n\nhttps://i.redd.it/hn7bsboqwht21.jpg\n\nhttps://i.redd.it/wjy2thfrwht21.jpg\n\nhttps://i.redd.it/hhddw3yrwht21.jpg\n\nHer friend messages me:\n\nhttps://i.redd.it/qgopkvytwht21.png\n\nThen my mother messages me trying to manipulate me, even though in the past she has actually kicked me out in the cold and threatened it enough since I was 16, actually after thinking about it since I was 14. So, since I care, I messaged her friend to let her know I am safe, but my mother wants more! (*By the way I put it in order so you can understand it easier*):\n\nhttps://i.redd.it/bmx3wpup0it21.png\n\nTHEN after this I get a message saying I stole from her when I ONLY TOOK MY SHIT, I did NOT take her suitcase, but my bookbag. I mean why the hell would I steal from her when I had to leave behind almost everything behind for her to sell in her benefit, PLUS my boyfriend makes enough to take care of both of us, so wtf? Another thing does it look like I need a straightening iron? I love the way my hair is, so why the hell would I steal that? :\n\nhttps://i.redd.it/d6txw88wwht21.png\n\nhttps://i.redd.it/6ze4n4lwwht21.png\n\nhttps://i.redd.it/2pkvlzdxwht21.jpg\n\nhttps://i.redd.it/p55qcltxwht21.jpg\n\nI continue to ignore her, then after this threat, I went to facebook and blocked her. She messaged me non-stop, this is what she has said:\n\nhttps://i.redd.it/z2g0ebe0xht21.png\n\nhttps://i.redd.it/i6scr5p0xht21.png\n\nhttps://i.redd.it/iknc3q41xht21.png\n\nhttps://i.redd.it/jzhe2wm1xht21.png\n\nhttps://i.redd.it/k0s58f22xht21.png\n\nhttps://i.redd.it/68cihrk2xht21.png\n\nhttps://i.redd.it/0k9ky033xht21.png\n\nhttps://i.redd.it/71pwtxpy0it21.png\n\nNow, since I now know my mother is a queen when it comes to manipulation, she posted this to hurt me, PUBLICLY. She keeps all her posts private because she does not like her enemies to know where she is at especially since she told me that someone was after her. BTW Honey Bun is my dog I had to leave behind.:\n\nhttps://i.redd.it/9zud7bk9tit21.png\n\n**Conclusion:** My boyfriend wants me to put a restraining order on her to prevent her from hurting me anymore, but I do not think that will stop her. Even though I am in a safe place now, I am still scared that I will be taken away somehow. I cannot sleep at night because I feel like at any moment she will find me.  \n\n\n* Edit: I put an update 2 on my mental health:  [https://www.reddit.com/r/abuse/comments/biftjt/update\\_2\\_the\\_aftereffects/](https://www.reddit.com/r/abuse/comments/biftjt/update_2_the_aftereffects/)", "subreddit": "abuse"}

This was like the... 7th time I went back to him? Over 3 long years. He always dumped me. We didn\u2019t last long at all this time - like, weeks. Got shorter every time. \n\nEnd of Jan - planned for me to visit him for a weekend (long distance, only met once). I couldn\u2019t make it. The next day, he discarded me.  Things had to be fair been rough. He said he wasn\u2019t sure about me and this trip was make or break. When it didn\u2019t happen, he didn\u2019t want to \u201cwait for me\u201d to rearrange. Said it was too much drama. \n\nMid feb - caved and contacted him. He basically told me to leave him tf alone, he didn\u2019t give a fuck about me, to have my own life, that he didn\u2019t think about me etc\n\nMid March - caved again after being dumb and seeing his ex on his social media. Started out as the above then I told him I missed him. Proceeded to having phone sex, him telling me he wasn\u2019t over me and implying he still loved me. (I told him I loved him, he said he felt the same but couldn\u2019t say it out loud....). He said we could talk again. Tells me he isn\u2019t trying it with anyone. But I got anxious and confronted him about a girl I saw on his social media. It got really nasty again, him telling me to leave him tf alone, me harassing him, him telling me I ruined my chances. \n\nTHREE DAYS LATER - he is Facebook official with a new girlfriend. The one that I confronted him about and he got mad. \n\nMid April - I confront him because I\u2019m stupid and find out the above. He tells me I ruined my chances (mid March) to be with him and so he moved on because I proved to him that I don\u2019t change and am crazy. Pretty much ignored the fact it was only three days!! He tells me to leave him alone and he did nothing wrong because he wasn\u2019t \u201cwith\u201d the girl at the time. And that he didn\u2019t lie to me. \u201cWe were done for ages\u201d. He said. \n\nMy heads just messed up atm. I was so mad to see that THREE DAYS after phone sex with me he has a new girlfriend. I know we were over but I don\u2019t know, that seems wrong. It seems too fast. But then I guess we WERE over. And he says he wasn\u2019t \u201cwith\u201d her or anything and I annoyed him??

The signs were all there, but I attributed it to his addiction issues and always assumed that once he got help and the drinking stopped, he would be basically fine. \n\nNot the case. Not the case with any addict, actually, but it was a tough lesson learned, regardless. \n\nIn any case, when we got the temp orders for our divorce, he was given supervised visits only. At my house. Supervised by me. \n\nI sobbed in the courtroom. For months, this man had stalked/harassed me, launched a massive smear campaign against me and my family, called me horrible names, trashed me to my own children (from a previous marriage), asked my previous husband to testify against me in court, attempted to sleep with my friends, threatened to take our baby away from me, swore he would take away all my parental rights, etc. etc. \n\nAnd then my own lawyer recommended that I supervise his visitation and Nex agreed... because of COURSE he did. What better way to keep tabs on me and make sure he\u2019s still getting his supply twice a week?\n\nThis has been an absolute nightmare. \n\nIf I try to reschedule any days (I\u2019ve only done it twice, once due to one of my older kids being extremely ill and the next time because he demanded I take our baby to the doctor over a diaper rash and that was the only time I could take off work), he goes into a frenzy. \n\nOnce I had power washers show up to clean the driveway and he refused to move his car, told me I had completely disrespected his time by scheduling something during his visitation (I didn\u2019t. They were very early) and then followed me around the house telling me how petty I was. I walked out on the porch for a cigarette, he followed me out and I went back inside and locked the door. He climbed in through a freaking window. \n\nSometimes he refuses to speak at all. Which is pretty ok with me. But when he does that, he stomps around slamming doors, making random messes, comes into my bedroom or uses my bathroom etc. \n\nI work from home, so I spend his whole visitation working in my bedroom. I interact with him as little as possible. Still, he accuses me of disrespecting his time and damaging his relationship with his daughter. \n\nHe\u2019s only supposed to communicate with me about our baby, as per our court order. But he uses her as an excuse to constantly bombard me with texts and pick fights with me about everything from who she sees to what she ate to whether or not she should go to the doctor for a mild diaper rash. \n\nI\u2019m trying to get him to register for a coparenting website to communicate through but he refuses. I offered to bring the baby to his apartment on his birthday so he can have an unsupervised day with her and enjoy his time more, but he argued about the small details of that so much I finally just gave up. \n\nI don\u2019t know what to do, honestly. Do I just let him have unsupervised visits so I can keep him out of my house?  I feel like I don\u2019t have any privacy or space that\u2019s free of him. I don\u2019t think he\u2019s dangerous to her and I do want him to have a relationship with her. But his behavior has been so erratic that I\u2019m afraid to let him leave with her. She\u2019s also a baby and more comfortable at home with her own things. I don\u2019t know, I just don\u2019t know what to do. I feel like if I start unsupervised visits, it\u2019ll be a \u201cwin\u201d for him and it\u2019ll be \u201cSee?  I fought for my daughter and forced my ex to obey me.  Look how justified all of this was, my hard work finally paid off.\u201d\n\nIs it worth it to let him have that satisfaction just to get him away from me?  The biggest part of his smear campaign is that I\u2019m keeping his child from him out of spite. But if I let him take her, he won\u2019t say it\u2019s because I care.  He\u2019ll say it\u2019s because he fought me and he won... and he\u2019ll be right. \n\nI really need advice or to hear some experiences", "subreddit": "NarcissisticAbuse"}

He had a history of being the teenager that yelled at his mom, fought kids, and punched inanimate objects. I always noticed he was a bit insecure/very jealous and that he was always getting worked up over insignificant events when we first got together but I was incredibly insecure (still working on it atm) and found it to be almost endearing. I honestly have some major experiences with him that I seem to still have nightmares about and think about quite often and while I know other situations occurred, it all sort of blurs together. I always feel guilty because I convince myself I am making it up or exaggerating to make myself look better or worry that I am suppressing it and forcing myself to forget some crucial information. A few situations that happened multiple times were yelling at me and calling me vulgar names in front of loved ones or in public (2 years in a row at the same concert he yelled at me and took my keys, telling me he was going to leave me there alone and to find a ride - he never really left) this concert is for an artist I have loved since I was a kid and look forward to seeing every year but now I have no desire to go at all because he left a sour taste in my mouth. I would be bawling my eyes out and he would not talk to me for the rest of the concert. This also happened at a float trip my family provided and at my graduation party. I also remember him always scaring me with suicidal comments if I attempted to discuss concerns/leaving once we lived together. He would lock himself in our room with a gun, throwing everything and punching holes in the wall and would let me scream and bang on the door for a couple of minutes before opening it. He told everyone after our break up that I was evil and abusive, posting on social media that I left because I was cheating and cowardice and that I hit him. He did not clarify that I did hit him after he screamed in my face, calling me names and scaring the shit out of me as he was shoving me out the front door of our home. I hit him in the chest at this point. I was humiliated as my roommate always witnessed all of this. He hated every guy and every friend I had. I lost a lot of weight and was pretty depressed when I was living there. He always was calling to yell and accuse me of things and then would say I shouldn\u2019t get so defensive and I would not be if I was innocent. There are multiple small, detailed stories to tie into these of course but this post is dragging on enough as it is. He told my family I was not the girl they all think I am and I was the single most evil thing to happen to him. My family always reassured me that anyone who truly knows me knows I would not hurt a fly. I was receiving threats and harassing texts on a daily basis so he is now blocked per therapist\u2019s advice. I didn\u2019t block him for over a year after the break up due to the thought of him killing himself being burned in my brain. I have finally accepted that if something were to actually happen it would not be my fault at this point in our lives. I also want to make it known that I do have faults in this relationship as well. I did lie a couple of times when we first got together (petty, high school behavior) but I felt that since he took me back (we took a decent break for awhile) he had forgiven me and we were moving on. However it was always brought up and the reason he felt the need to watch/accuse me. He also used my coworkers and ex boyfriends against me. He didn\u2019t like that I had exes. I got caught in a handful of other white lies such as \u201ctexting my mom\u201d when actually was texting a best friend/guy coworker but this was not to hide lies or cheating, etc but instead to avoid a fight. I don\u2019t open up much about this as I feel like I would be looking for pity or am annoying my family. I know he was not good to me most of the time, but I feel scared that he is right and I make this all up in my head to convince myself and loved ones that I am the victim. I have read countless posts hoping to feel relief of this but nothing has helped. I suppose I\u2019m just looking for unbiased opinions and if it does not sound abusive, to be told so. If you read this far thank you, and if you have advice I am all ears. If not, I\u2019m glad I was able to get it off my chest. Love and peace to all XX", "subreddit": "emotionalabuse"}

I was abused and later raped at the age of 8. I kept silent and let myself \"handle it.\" I haven't gone through therapy, and as a twenty-something year old, I wonder if I'm normal so to speak. I hate enclosed spaces, I realized I won't ever be the same. I can't go back to who I was, and I'd like to think it's because I was a child. There are many times I realize I'm not particularly normal. I have never been in a relationship and run at the first sign of one. I hate being touched doesn't matter if it's a hug or a pat on the hand, it makes me want to cower in a corner. I hate being around people in general, and as time has gone on I realize I lash out and I never really know why. I'm terrified at the idea of marriage or children. I hate my abuser, and hate my father for talking to him.  It's not his fault because I kept him in the dark but I wished for my abuser's death. I decided, in the end, it was terrible to hate him so I hated myself. I feel dirty, broken, and can't understand why anyone would have any interest in me. Perhaps it is normal to feel like this but I also feel like therapy could help? I ask that in a question because I've been looking at a therapist who works with victims of abuse and I've been doing so for years now. I want to speak with her but I've had what I assume are panic attacks every time. I keep getting flashbacks of the abuse and I honestly don't see how going to a therapist would help.

She discarded me but we stayed in the same house for extenuating circumstances and did not file for divorce for similar reasons. About 3 months after she discarded, I realized her behaviors fit pretty well with NPD, so I made a plan to move out and tell our kids. She and I went back and forth with a written separation plan I insisted should be signed and notarized. There's no legal separation in my state, but figured some paper trail is better than nothing.\n\nThat plan involved waiting to file for divorce, opening separate personal bank accounts seeded with some funds for each of us. The plan says we would fund personal expenses and travel from the personal accounts. We verbally discussed that personal expenses included meals without kids, personal grooming, Uber/Lyft, donations, and a few other things. Months later after I moved out and healed a lot, I wanted to start nailing down the terms for the divorce, she dragged her feet and missed her own deadlines, so I filed for divorce.\n\nThis separation plan document has helped me to call her out on her behavior a few times. I keep to writing email or Our Family Wizard (now) and have written that she is \"untrustworthy\" a couple times, while including undisputable proof. She does not defend herself or explain herself, but just responds that she will not stand for name calling. My thoughts are, if you don't exhibit this behavior, I won't need to call you out.\n\nSo, there was one time that I found multiple personal checks written from our shared checking account for hair salon, waxing, tanning, and eyelash extensions, along with a personal donation. I called her out, she didn't like the name calling, paid back the shared account from her personal account and even a bit more for other stuff she came clean for. I responded with, you're probably only bringing that up because you've been caught with the other stuff. She disagreed.\n\nThen a month later, I found another check, called her out, same response. I clarified that personal expenses included the things we had verbally discussed. She said, of course, she already knew that and said she had been paying for her personal meals from her personal account. She also said we just do things differently, and let's hurry up and finalize the divorce.\n\nToday, I received a trickle of financial discovery from her related to our divorce. I found a bunch more instances of personal charges that get paid out through our shared account. She charged thousands more on personal meals, travel, clothing, etc. I sent her a message today about this with highlighted statements and a total of questionable/personal expenses. I didn't call her untrustworthy, but called out her previous notarized agreement and verbal agreement and asked for an explanation.\n\nI have statements through the end of 2018. Who knows how much more has continued to go on since then.\n\nI'd like to withdraw a large chunk of our shared savings now to my personal account to protect myself from more of the same as the divorce is still pending. I'll check with my attorney before I take that action, though.", "subreddit": "NarcissisticAbuse"}

I did not continue my contract after the 6 months due to a lost of interest and to take care of my mother, to which my dad and her will keep on screaming at my ears almot everyday and asking me to find another job. The fact that she herself was going into her 50s and my dad told me that she is unable to control her anger and venting out her anger on me, is starting to get on my nerves. She claimed that everyone was caring about their own business but no one would listen to her. When we gave her the time to talk, she would refuse the chance to be heard and replied \u201cI should be the one whom you listen to all the time, not simply a moment of time\u201d.

Then, he changed his mind drastically. Up until even 3 days before my 19 week ultrasound, he said he wished I would\u2019ve had an abortion. But he told his family and friends that he couldn\u2019t be more excited for the baby. \n\nHe tells me that he likes something (like when we were deciding the color of the paint) then tells me that he never liked it weeks later when he\u2019s in a bad mood. He is never consistent with his opinions. \n\nHe calls me spineless and says I have no backbone, but when I decide that I want something done or have an opinion, I\u2019m controlling.\n\nHe\u2019s had drunken rages once a month since I moved in with him in December. He has punched a lot of holes in the walls, shattered pictures, destroyed a tv, broke furniture in half, grabbed me, and threatened to hit me last month when I was 34 weeks pregnant. I have this \u201crage\u201d on recording and it\u2019s downright scary. You can hear him destroying the house, calling me a worthless cunt, and then saying that he cares about me. He called his mom that night at 2am and she came by his side, cleaned all of the broken glass up, and neither of them would let me leave that night. She told me not to bring up the fight until after his exam the following Monday so that he could focus for it. He apologized the next morning in tears as usual and claimed he meant none of it and that he will change. But he said he can\u2019t change on his own: he needs ME to help him change. \n\nHe blames these drunken rages on stress and on me building him up to his breaking point. He tells me that I need to look in a mirror and self-evaluate because I\u2019m making him get to that point. He says that it\u2019s normal and that everyone goes through those things.\n\nHe almost only does nice, thoughtful things if people will either witness it or see it later. He takes credit for things I have done for him. It was the day before a new semester of school for him and I knew he was stressed because he didn\u2019t have any of his school stuff organized or together. I took time out of most of my day to create a study space for him and organized all of his school supplies, setup his printer, cleared a desk/table, and completed the area with a dry erase board. He told everyone who has seen it that he did it. \n\nTo shorten this post, he told me to leave and that he didn\u2019t want to be with me on Tuesday and I\u2019m 39 weeks pregnant. After speaking to me 5 days later, he wants to be with me and I\u2019m \u201callowed to come back to the house\u201d if I want. He is only concerned about his finals this week and did not ask about the baby or me giving birth whatsoever.\n\nI\u2019m not trying to be vindictive, but I think I may name my baby what I want and give him my last name. I\u2019ve tried so hard to be a family, but I can\u2019t take being blamed for everything anymore. I feel so belittled and abused. I feel nothing like myself. I\u2019m living in such a small part of my mind and I\u2019m miserable. I\u2019ve never felt so helpless before in my life... I\u2019m constantly reevaluating myself wondering if it really is my fault, but I have to stop because it isn\u2019t. Nothing I could ever say or do would deserve me being grabbed, screamed at, and threatened at 34 weeks pregnant. I also cannot believe that his mom would see all of that and defend him. I\u2019ve been telling myself that I HAVE to get out before it gets worse. It\u2019s easier to stay, but my baby boy could be here any day now and I HAVE to do what\u2019s right for him.", "subreddit": "NarcissisticAbuse"}

Being sexually abused by my dad. I recently had sex for the first time ever. With a \"girlfriend\". She turned out to be manipulative and  a stalker. I regret that I let someone touch me. Yesterday, stupid, disgusting me was watching porn. And then I saw something that happened when I had sex for the first time. Like.. exactly the same. I got triggered and I had a bad seizure. I was convulsing so violently it felt like my brain was bashing into my skull and it really hurt. I had to keep quiet because my mom was sleeping in the room next to me. Otherwise I would've cried hysterically. Today I felt so low. I honestly feel like I might spiral out of control. Get depressed again. If I'm not already depressed. I wish I never had sex with her. Everything about it feels wrong. I should've never done it. I'm disgusting. Utterly disgusting. And ugly.  \nI knew I wasn't dealing well with all of this.. having a girlfriend for the first time.. I'm 28 btw. So I asked my GP for a referral to a therapist. I sent the group practice and email, explained, as far as I felt able, what the issue was and asked them to see which therapist would be able to help me. They emailed me back: We're looking at it internally. Just that simple line.. has me flipping out! I'm so fucking terrified of therapy. I've had therapy before but not like this. Not about the most difficult part about all of it: sexuality and relationships. I'm spiraling.... I'm doing worse by the week. I don't know where to reach out. I don't want my family or friends to know. So the only place I could think of was reddit. Nobody knows me on reddit. And that's how I make myself lonely. I hate myself. I hate my ... ugh..

A sin that I cannot keep anymore. I\u2019m already at the end of my wits. I couldn\u2019t keep up anymore. Even now, I\u2019m shaking heavily and my chest is aching. My heart feels like it\u2019s being stab many, many times with a very sharp needle that can pierce right through while injecting a poison each time. My earliest memory with it started with my stepfather kissing me multiple times while I was asleep. During that time, my mother was taking a shower and I was awake, pretending to sleep. Since I was still 11 or 12, I was still going through puberty. And so, whenever I see him, I used to keep looking at his lips and he would eventually catch me looking at him and jokes about me wanting a kiss from him. I don\u2019t know if he knew that I was still conscious at that time but I believe he wouldn\u2019t remember that now. After that incident, it kept getting worse. Whenever I get sick and gets send home by the school nurse, he would leave his work place and take me home with him. He started to touch my breasts whenever I was weak. Then, eventually, he started to fiddle around my body and tries to masturbate after making me cum. Now, 4 or 5 years of carrying this \u201cjob\u201d, he managed to convince my mother to let him and me stay in one bedroom while she stays with my brothers. And to make it worse, he is 42 and I am 17 which is the same age as his daughter who is living with his ex wife. And now, everyday, he forces me to have sex with him. The only reason why I am keeping this a secret is because my family is struggling under a large amount of debt and I haven\u2019t had the chance to meet my real father and so I\u2019m keeping this shameful act to keep my family from falling a part knowing that he would rather save himself than others as he manipulated my naive and weak mother into bearing two kids and to let my half brothers have a father figure in the house.\n\nI\u2019m afraid of what will happen in the future.\nI just want to die,\n\nI didn\u2019t ask for this to happen\n\nThere was no way of me knowing he would act like this even though he seems to take good care of my half brothers and my mother.\n\nI wanted to confess this just to let out this heavy burden as I am suffering and I don\u2019t know what to do.", "subreddit": "abuse"}

For some background: I have been a victim of sexual assault and it has formed a large part of my personality and my best friend knows this.\n\nAround a year back, she started dating a boy from my HS and I was very against this because I'd heard from several people that he was an asshole and in general displayed sexist, entitled behaviour, but this didn't really affect her. Some months into their relationship, I found out that he raped a girl in my school. As a victim myself this affected me a lot and speaking to her leaves no doubt in my mind that she's being honest about her experience because I could identify so many similarities in our experience, thought processes and behaviour. Plus, I know she had been going to therapy and also had a blog where she wrote about her experience over the months ( without mentioning his name/details). Along with all of that and the fact that not many people know about this, I believe she's being honest and not fabricating anything as it doesn't benefit her in any way. While they were dating, I told my friend about this but she completely dismissed it and refused to believe me and we never spoke of it again because if we did I would not be able to continue the friendship. \n\nAround 7 months into the relationship, he dumps her and she chooses this time to believe what I told her. She bonds with his victim and convinces herself that she's better off without him and that he's an asshole and essentially uses his victim's trauma to get over him. A month after that she tells me that she had a conversation with him and no longer believes the victim because she knows him and personally doesn't think he's capable of such a thing. As much as this hurt me, I chose to ignore it and move on as I thought he would never be a part of her life again because of how badly he treated her during their relationship. Later I find out that she's talking to him on a daily basis and they're hooking up again.\n\nAt this point, I've had enough and tell her I can't be friends with her anymore because this series of events has made me reconsider who she is as a person and her believing her ex over the victim despite the overwhelming evidence for the contrary is something I can't digest. I told her this affects me to a greater extent because of my personal trauma and can only think about whether people wouldn't believe me either if they knew my rapist. She thinks I'm making this about myself and that isn't fair to equate the two and that I can't deal with the fact that she has a different opinion than I do. She believes that I'm throwing away a friendship of 10+ years over a boy and that I'm being stupid. Despite everything, I don't want to let go of this friendship but cannot if she's so dismissive. \n\nDid I do the right thing? Am I being selfish? Did I overreact? I don't know what to do.

We were still a 5 hour drive from family, so it was not unusual for family to come visit us for the beach.  When I was 13, my cousin came over for the summer.  She was a few years younger than I was, short for her age and raised by my aunt who was a single mother.  Her biological father has pretty much been absent and the only thing I knew about him was that he was Air Force.  Whatever, never met the guy and apparently he's been gone so long no one really knows much about him.  About the time my cousin was 10, my aunt was engaged to another guy who had 2 children already, a son and daughter.  Both of his first kids were older than my cousin and the couple of times I met them, they seemed like rowdy country kids.  I grew up in the city and then the beach, so country was how I saw them.  When my parents told me that my cousin was coming over for the summer, I didn't really connect any dots at first.\n\nShe and my sister shared a bedroom and because of our ages, I was the oldest in the house so when my parents went off to work, I was in charge.  For the most part we played in the back yard, took our dog for walks and went to the nearby dock we had access to.  I thought my cousin was just being shy at first, and really wouldn't hang out with me unless my sister was around.  This would make more sense later, but with none of us able to drive or had our own money, it was kind of a lazy summer break.  My dad took us out to a couple tourist spots over the summer when he took some days off, we hit the beach more times than we normally did, and after a week my cousin was more friendly and explained to us the entire story of Dragon Ball Z.  In fact, I blame my anime love on my cousin, Toonami was still playing at the time and she introduced us to it.  \n\nI began to hear things that her step-brother got into some kind of trouble and was going to be living with his mom.  I wasn't sure what kind of trouble, but it must have been something big if he wasn't going to live with his dad and my cousin anymore.  In the eyes of a young teen, I didn't really think to ask why my cousin was spending so much time with us and not with her family and about her step brother getting into trouble.  It was only after about 3 weeks that my Mom and Dad explained to me in private that my cousin had been sexually abused by him.  I don't know how far it went, and to this day I hear about my cousin visiting the therapist a few times a year.  I haven't been able to bring the topic up with her, but there have been times when I began to catch little hints here and there.  As adults, I find that at family gatherings she likes to hang around me, mostly because we exchange anime we both like now and because I was what she saw as one of the trustworthy male family she has.  I'm not sure how much of an impact I had that summer, just being a cool older cousin who lives near the beach, It's not like I bought stuff for her with my non existent money or drove her to all the fun stuff.  Somehow I did something right during that summer and by the end of the summer break, her step brother was out of the picture and I haven't heard about him since.\n\nI still look back and wonder if I was just woefully ignorant or if I wasn't caring enough, but I find it disturbing that I didn't know she had been a target of sexual abuse until weeks after she moved in with us.  On the one hand, my parents might have wanted her to have a bit of \"normal life\" without people constantly asking her how she was feeling, on the other maybe I should have picked up on what was going on and I just missed it, but I still imagine how I could've been nicer that summer instead of just being a lazy kid on summer break.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI don't share this story because I'm wracked with guilt, nor do I even approach the idea that I'm fishing for sympathy, but I'm curious if there are others in this community who found out months later and it came as a complete surprise to them.  I'm glad I did something right for my cousin, even if without knowing what was going on, but I wonder what I could've done differently if I had known sooner.

So I get upset easily. I have been bullied since year 2 up until I dropped out at the end of year 11. All this in Australia whiched I live. On with the story\n\nSo it started after school when I was on a bus talking to some friends. I was only 14 when this happened. I was talking to friends which were a seat behind. So I had to lean over the chair to talk to them. We were in the middle of the bus and at the back were some really bad kids. They were calling me names and stuff. They knew me for some reason. Maybe because from the years they bullied me. I was a easy target. One of them had a idea to throw a lighted match at me. At the time it was winter and I was eating a jacket that was from the school and was flammable. So one of the kids throwed the lighted match at me. Luckily, it burned out just before it touched me. \n\nAt the next stop, I told the bus driver what happened and he said he will deal with them. He didn't. I wanted to get away from the bad kids so I got off the stop before mine to be safe. Bad choice. They followed me off the buss and after the bus left, they surrounded me. They told me I was a snitch and didn't realise for around 20 seconds. So I tried to run away and they grabbed me in the middle of the road. They start to kick, punch and spit at me. They called me names while doing it. It lasted for around a minute and they just ran away afterwards. They had siblings cause I saw them watched as I got beaten up. I was brused, bleading and I was crying like I had no air in my lungs. \n\nI lemp to the nearest shops cause I knew that a cop was always there cause their was a liquor store at these shops. I manage to get there and told the cop what happened. As a finished telling the cop what happened, a different set of friends whiched I hang with aswell came around the corner and they saw me in pain. I also told them what happened and they were shocked to see me like that. One of them knew my dad's number. So he called him and from what my dad told me (he had the day off), he dropped everything and came to me. He arrived minutes later and me and the friend who called him got into his car and tried to find them. We couldn't. \n\nThe report I did went through and around a week later, I had to be called into a room at the police station where they interview criminals. I told them in detail and surprisely, my dad knew why they were cause he has to deal with them before. All the people who beat me up got changed with assault and they never bullied me again.

I've got a friend who I'm sure is some Cluster B, and seems to exhibit a lot of narcissistic qualities so I'm simplifying my language to focus on that. So to condense a long story, this \"friend\" (who I thought was a friend until I didn't) who I've ultimately gone LC with since we still have mutual friends and I'm choosing to withdraw rather than talk about her aside from to one person who has also seen this and has also gone LC:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* Asked a friend, I'll call J, to lie to me (and because J had a crush on the narc they did) about a video game we were all playing and which the narc had cheated on because the narc, per her own confession can't stand to lose (this is, for the record, a game with no negative outcomes and is meant purely to spark joy).\n* Early in our friendship, would text J and I 100-200 x a day, in a group text.\n* Has tried to convince J that I'm what's making J sad (triangulation).\n* Mostly stopped communicating with/speaking to me once she had J's attention.\n* Engages in the silent treatment if she feels like I've been mean to her, or when J made a comment that was truly about J, but that the narc wanted to be offended by, or whenever else one of us has engaged in a transgression.\n* Talks to hear herself talk, but if you indicate in some way that you're either a) not interested or b) what's she's stating is obvious, she says you don't have to have a \"tone\" with her or will accuse you of trying to silence her.\n* Would make plans with J, who was also one of my roommates, for just after the three of us hung out and neither of the would say anything until I thought J and I were leaving (J has since said this was the narc's request, and isn't sure why they went along with it, but didn't realize how much it would hurt my feelings) and then suddenly J wouldn't be leaving.\n* Talks negatively about everyone (exes, friends, coworkers, her roommates) all the time.\n* Insinuated herself and my and J's life through a series of \"drama\" going on between her roommates, in which she somehow made herself out to be the victim.\n* Is rude to waitstaff, cashiers, etc. to the point a previous boyfriend had to explain why it was important to be kind.\n* (In the past, when we were still \"friends,\") introduced herself every time she walks up to me, when I'm with a friend, even if it was just for a simply hand-off of something, like a house key or a pick-up-as-a-favor item from the store.\n* Says \"I feel like people should just be certain ways. And I judge them when they aren't.\"\n* Is hyper competitive and brags about this.\n* Won't apologize for anything.\n* Has called one of her roommates all sorts of pretty awful names in the heat of the moment.\n* Thinks her other roommate is unhealthy and unclean purely because of that roommate's choice to play video games pretty regularly.\n* Doesn't want her things touched, but becomes upset if either of her roommates request their things not be moved (and the narc will mean not touching her things in their shared fridge; the roommates will mean a complete rearranging of the kitchen).\n* Steals from family members and then tries to justify it (i.e. - they couldn't really appreciate what they had, the narc can). \n* Stole money from a previous roommate.\n* Snuck into that previous roommate's room to use that roommate's things without his permission.\n* She tries to find out intimate details about people, but then won't self divulge to the same level and just leaves it as a mysterious \"I'll tell you later,\" and if you follow up, she shrugs it off or again promises later.\n* Engages in a lot of binary thinking (she's tried to convince J that her roommate and I are so sad, unlike her and J--even while J has made it clear that J is struggling with severe depression; has told her roommate J and I aren't like them because we aren't 'spiritual'; etc.)\n* Made my cat dying about her, because I didn't personally tell her, even though several other friends did. No condolences, nothing, \"until \\[OP\\] tells me themselves.\"\n* Texts purely informational texts (or bragging texts) and expects a reply.\n* Once didn't speak to me for days because I took more than 24 hours to respond (not that it should matter, but also on a day when I essentially worked a double) and told our mutual friends she wasn't speaking to me because \"I'd changed.\"\n* Will constantly text J, or our other friends, if she knows that we are hanging out together without her (not me, because I'm LC and grey rocking when I do have to see her at common hangouts).\n* Brags all the time about how much work she gets done at work and how lazy / ineffective / stupid her coworkers are.\n* Changes personality depending on who she's around.\n* \"Only\" dates pretty boys.\n* Lies all the time, about stuff that doesn't matter and also things she seems to think will make her sound virtuous (some of this is because she's mirroring; other parts of it is just perplexing to me).\n* Rules don't apply to her the way they apply to other people (i.e. for a while she stopped speaking to a friend who used eggs, but when the narc used eggs and that friend pointed it out, she just said \"It's different.\")\n* Has given a grieving friend a timeline for how long they're \"allowed' to grieve before they need to \"be fun again,\" and wasn't kidding at all.\n* Says she thrifts her clothes, because she thinks J and I will appreciate that, but actually gets them from one of the places that will mail you a box of clothes and you keep what you like.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThose of you with narc friends, what's your experience like?", "subreddit": "NarcissisticAbuse"}

I can\u2019t be totally upfront with anybody because I\u2019m afraid of what could happen if word got out. My pregnant girlfriend is extremely jealous and clingy. I have no free time away from her which honestly I could deal with if she didn\u2019t get upset when I do things I enjoy. I enjoy playing music and haven\u2019t touched it in months because she gets upset when my attention isn\u2019t 100% on her. I feel like I betray her when I do anything other than what she needs me to do at the moment because I feel like she\u2019s not herself. I wouldn\u2019t know for sure because she became pregnant immediately after we got together. I\u2019ve known her for years but it seems like she\u2019s a different person than what she portrays to the public eye. We don\u2019t have a perfect relationship and things moved entirely too quickly, obviously. But there have been a few instances where suicide is threatened when we argue. She has had to give up a lot and didn\u2019t expect pregnancy. She was under the impression that she couldn\u2019t have any more children so it took her by surprise. She does honestly seem depressed but only if we aren\u2019t getting along. She accuses me of cheating on her on a daily basis when I would never do anything of the sorts, and if I want to hang out with a friend she makes me feel horrible. I have a second job on the weekends where I get to work alone. Now she comes with me so I literally am either at my nine to five or with her. She hates being there and doesn\u2019t even speak to me while we\u2019re there, she just insists on going with me. Before she started coming with me she would show up unannounced and claimed to be only checking up on me because she was worried. She constantly assumes that I lie about where I am and tells me to just leave her or \u201cgo ahead and talk to whoever\u201d when I\u2019m doing nothing wrong. If I don\u2019t stay on the phone with her while I drive or have free time she claims that I don\u2019t love her and can\u2019t even talk to her on the phone. She has threatened the life of the baby and herself on several occasions, has burned her forearm with a cigarette and once she even hit her stomach, although not very hard, during a very heated argument, almost as to send a message more than cause any damage. I got rid of all the ammunition to her handgun. I don\u2019t feel like I have any other option other than to put up with it for the time being. I worry about my son but I know when he\u2019s born she would never act the way she has been. She gets very upset with me easily and I can\u2019t lie I get upset as well. It is infuriating that I can\u2019t say or do anything without her making assumptions and as many times as I\u2019ve begged her not to assume and to just ask me about things she continues to do it. She has deleted contacts out of my phone, told me who I can and can\u2019t talk to and just this morning I found out she\u2019s blocked a few childhood friends from social media. She picks through my following/follower list and dictates how I should use my social media. I wouldn\u2019t care to get rid of it to be honest and it\u2019s not that big of a deal to me.

As a child of an emotionally and physically abusive household, he grew up with a lack of trust, a high level of empathy, and a very analytical mind that is always running scenarios and seeking as much certainty in an uncertain world as possible. Without information, he assumes the absolute worst outcome possible (even when others are much more probable). He greets people with a default LACK of trust, requiring it to be earned.

He works very hard to make space and have those he cares about have the things they want.

I'm constantly questioning every move I make, everything I say, everything I feel, because I place this man that I truly adore in a similar category as my exes, and he has done nothing to deserve it in any way. \n\nMy previous relationships involved rape on multiple occasions, using suffocation as a form of punishment for not listening or for questioning my S/O, cheating on so many occasions I lost count, and many many instances of extreme physical abuse, where on more than one occasion, I ended up hospitalized. \n\nI currently go to therapy to cope with my previous trauma as well as to deal with my anxiety issues and I am actively working on myself and dealing with the things that I've been through. \n\nRecently, one of my ex boyfriends, who nearly killed me on at least 3 occasions ran into me at my job, and refused to leave. He wanted to start a conversation and I repeatedly asked him to leave the store that I was working at because I was shaking, insanely, and on the verge of a full on breakdown. Since then, I've been having intensive night terrors, questioning every single thing my current S/O does, more than I normally do with my general anxiety, and have been so insanely insecure in every possible way because of the previous infidelity in my relationships. I know this isn't fair to my current S/O, and he's been so extremely supportive and understanding. \n\nNow I have constant fear that while I work on my trauma processing through therapy, he's going to get sick of dealing with the baggage that I carry, and he's going to leave. I'm terrified because I've literally fallen for this man so quickly, and that he deserves so much better, yet, he continues to want me. \n\nIf anyone has any advice on coping with these histories, and being able to be fully open with your partner about the trauma you've been through, it would be deeply appreciated. \n\nI know I'll get a response about remaining single until I cope with it on my own, however, the person that I'm with is incredible, and again, I've fallen for him, deeply. He's shown tremendous support and has on more than one occasion reassured me that he will be here through every step of this process. \n\nI just genuinely worry about fully opening up about the things I've experienced, about how far the abuse went, about being sexually abused by a cousins friend when I was a young child, and him looking at me differently. I'm an extremely independent person 99% of the time, and leaning on him, my friends, or anyone is really hard for me to do. Plus he cares deeply for me, and I don't want him to get worked up over hearing about the people from my past and what they've done to me. \n\nI don't know if I should write it out, and allow him to read my history on his own time, or if I should just let it go and just use my therapist as a venting space and leave my current S/O out of it, but holding everything in is not doing it for me. It's causing so many problems in myself and I know eventually it cause issues in my current relationship. I just need some advice if anyone has any to spare.", "subreddit": "abuse"}

My father used to call me by my name and I would playfully run away and he would chase me, not on this day. My dad weighed 350 pounds at the time. I was told later on when the abuse came to light that I should have just hit my father. Why the heck would I do that?! He would've killed me!! I went into my mom's room and she was watching tv. I asked her if I could sit with her and watch tv too. She said yes of course, and my dad came into the room and demanded that I get out of \"his chair.\" I said no, mom said I could sit here and watch tv.

I then wrote him a nasty text telling him how he treated me wasn't fair. He blocked me on everything. I wrote to a friend he was close with to understand if she knew he had previously cheated (they tell eo everything) and if she did, wishing she would have maybe told me earlier. I also told her that I was concerned about his professional behaviour (maybe not my place to say) that he was using his profession and details of 'hot' clients to look them up on Instagram-- I caught him out when he was searching on instagram and it appeared and I asked him about it. Took him ages to fess up.\n\nWhen I suspected him of cheating I had messaged a girl prior just before the breakup-- she said he didn't think he was that kind of person etc and no. I said I didn't think that either at the start. I explained what I went through (gas lighting etc) and told her she's lucky she dodged a bullet.

During my time with him all of my ribs were broken multiple times, both arms have been broken, as well as multiple fingers. When I found out I was pregnant I was stabbed multiple times, kicked and if it weren't for my pitbull who intervened I would've died. My baby boy was born with a brain malformation due to the trauma and was born early. We still deal with seizures and he is physically delayed but otherwise perfect. My son has a half sister who is 13, one that is 10, one that is 8, a half brother who is 5 and another that is 2. All of which are by different women. During my time with him I knew of the 2 oldest girls and spent alot of time with them. I am still close too their mothers and them. This \"man\" has a girlfriend and she had 1 son that she brought into the relationship and 2 by him. Next week that girlfriend and my ex will be in court. All of the mothers of his children plan to go as their stories are similar to mine. Last year we found out via the news that our ex raped 3 of his girlfriend's children ,all 3 boys two of which were his biological children, tortured them and then when one ran away the girlfriend brought him back and both continued the abuse of those children. It was only found because the school they go too has an officer that noticed the bruises. I thank God that I never allowed my son to see him. We do not know the extent of abuse those children suffered but we do know that keeping our children away saved their lives. We all called child services many times trying to protect those children. We have all tried to talk to the girlfriend and get her and the children out. I have seen her many times with broken bones and dumb excuses at the hospital I work at. Now we know those two were meant for each other. I just hope those children will be able to one day find happiness and safety in a better home. I also hope that those two never see the light of day again. All of the mom's felt so relieved, we could finally breathe and not fear for our lives and the lives of our children the day he was arrested. We have all been stalked and harassed by him. We were afraid to let our children out of our site. I bought a weapon, I learned how to use it, and I took self defense classes. My pitbull was killed the day she protected me but she will never be forgotten. I now have 2 pit bulls, 3 German shepherds and a rooster. For many years we all lived in fear but not anymore.\n\nEdit: So we have been trying to get custody and adopt my ex's 2 boys and their older brother that are in foster care. Our case is on the home stretch and looking like June for the adoption. I also found out this morning that I am about 6 weeks pregnant. Ultrasound set up for 2 wks from today so we will know exactly how far along I am. I am super excited our little family will go from 3 to 7 this year. That is crazy. We bought a largehome last year and have started to remodel the upstairs to accomidate our growing family. We will have 5 bedrooms upstairs , walls already in place yay, and 2 bathrooms. Also 3 rooms downstairs 2 bathrooms and a half bath. I am super glad when we started the remodel last year we went with a large kitchen and living space as the home was pretty much hollowed out. We are also adding on a den that we poored the slab for this morning. That will be the kids space. My family this year will now consist of an 8 year old, a six year old, a five year old, a two year old, and a newborn that I am kinda hoping will be a girl because I am seriously outnumbered now. Either way I will be happy with my blessing. So yay also my ex got 25 - life and we managed to get no contact orders in place for all of the children. My son has already picked out his new bedroom as the 2 downstairs near my bedroom will be turned into nurseries. He is super excited to be getting a new bigger bedroom. I am also trying to convince my husband that the stairs going to the second floor needs a slide because that is just awesome.", "subreddit": "survivorsofabuse"}

In reality, all I had done was confess to my best friend that I was in love with him, which I realize isn\u2019t great to do when you\u2019re in a relationship but I was so miserable and tired of being tortured.

I didn\u2019t force him into a sex contract. I didn\u2019t scream and yell and call him names. I didn\u2019t pretend to have schizophrenia so he would feel too guilty to leave me. I didn\u2019t ignore him for three days because he wouldn\u2019t eat me out on our school bus, surrounded by our friends (yes that\u2019s a real thing that happened, he wanted a blowjob but I said it was too obvious and he literally blocked me on everything for three days). I never ever told him \u201cchoose me or your best friend it has to be one or the other.\u201d And he did that to me more than once.

So I met an individual online. We hit it off, and seemed to have many things in common. I asked them to my place on Saturday since we were having a party with friends, and they said they would come out. Throughout the week they would ask me to come and see them at their place and I kept telling them that I was busy this week due to the party and friends coming out and all that. They said they understood but repeat asking is a bit odd.\n\nSo Saturday comes around, and they show up at our house. My partner tried talking with them, but they ignored my partner basically and would rather talk to anyone than my partner. My partner even sat next to them and tried to get them to talk. And this individual would just look at their phone (I found this out later since I was in the restroom and collecting some things).\n\nA little bit later on, it was just this person and me. We started to kiss, okay that\u2019s fine. They start to rub my leg. Okay that\u2019s fine I don\u2019t mind. I choke them some (we have previously discussed this as something they like), and they seem okay with it. Then this person took their hand on my leg and decided to go straight for my genitalia.\n\nNow a little bit about me: I am someone that does not do this. I am not a kiss on the first date person. I usually won\u2019t romantically hold your hand until the 2nd-3rd\u00a0date depending on the person and am very hesitant to be sexual with anyone unless I really know them. So this is very uncomfortable for me to have my genitalia touched on the first time meeting someone. I continue to kiss them a little bit while they are groping my genitalia then I stop and put my hands up and asked to calm down and let\u2019s take a minute. After we stopped, and I tried to talk to them but they were more interested in making out with me. Again, they tried to grope me and, again, I said to calm down and let\u2019s take a breather.\n\nAt this point, after all that, my partner walks in and grabs some things. I try to start a conversation with them and this person, and the only one who does not want to talk is the person I invited over. My partner is visibly upset, and this person I asked to come hang out with us is acting like nothing is wrong. I am just perplexed and getting overwhelmed\u00a0by the whole thing so I go talk to my partner. They are not having a good time and this person I invited is being rude to my partner. After my partner lists their grievances, I tell them I\u2019ll ask this person to leave because I\u2019m not feeling comfortable with them either.\n\nI asked this person to leave because my partner is not feeling well so I need to take care of them. So they leave and ask if they\u2019d see me again on Tuesday (we made plans for that time) and I said \u201cmaybe.\u201d They send me a message saying \u201csorry if I did something wrong.\u201d\n\nI sat on it, and the next night I sent them a message saying the more I thought about last night the more it made me uncomfortable and that I don\u2019t think I can be in any kind of relationship with them and that I apologize that things didn\u2019t work out. They said it was okay and hopefully we can still be friends. Then the next day they see me on the dating site we met and they send me a message saying that I can\u2019t even handle casual sexual encounters and how embarrassed and humiliated they are and they didn\u2019t realize that this would make them feel like a wreck.\n\nSince the encounter, I have been noticing things changing about me (a very interesting feat for someone with cPTSD). I have conflicting emotions. I constantly feel dirty and am getting slowly more paranoid about things like dirt and dust around me. I am almost crying over blogs that have no relation at all to my situation. I keep having moments where I am dazed and confused and then I come back to reality for a bit. I keep blaming myself. I feel the urge to be sexual, and yet I don\u2019t have a sex drive right now. My sex drive has been nonexistent since this incident, and usually I still have some kind of sexual desire even when I\u2019m not in the mood. I am subscribed to quite a few porn subreddits and they do nothing for me. It\u2019s like I know I find that attractive and sexual, just I don\u2019t feel the emotions associated with it. I had sex with my partner the next night after the event happened, and I kept having issues because my head was just not in it. Since the person sent me that vitriol of a message I have blocked them from contacting me.\n\nIt\u2019s all still really fresh for me. I also feel like a big baby because, as the classic mantra goes \u201csomeone has it worse off than you,\u201d and I already delegitimize my issues enough as is, so my initial reaction is to bury this and repress, but I can\u2019t seem to get it to bury and it\u2019s just causing pain and conflict in my head and that alone is driving me insane because compared to other atrocities it\u2019s a speck, yet it feels like someone just beat me up nonchalantly.\n\nI\u2019m writing this not for advice or for sympathy. I also intentionally left out gender specifics because to me, this feels like a form of sexual abuse, and abuse should be seen as something that is not gendered. I hope it lets people know that it doesn\u2019t matter your gender, abuse is abuse, and that you\u2019re worth more than your gender and you deserve to be happy, no matter what society tells you.

Whether it is or not, what can I do about it?", "author": "AndJellyfish", "self_text": "Title says it all, I guess. I'm 17(f), my mum found out I was gay by going on my phone a year ago and found out I was dating my same-sex friend. Every day I regret leaving it at home that morning instead of taking it to school with me.\n\nThe first few months were very bad, she would sit in her room and cry, I felt terrible for upsetting her, even though there is nothing wrong with being gay. She also lost all trust with me for hiding such a thing from her. I thought it would get better, but I think as time has gone by it has only gotten worse.\n\nSo... what has she done? It's hard for me to remember, it's been going on for over a year now. \n\nShe told me it was just a phase, of course. Though not politely, there was a lot of very rude, homophobic things said. She believes that gay people, especially lesbians, are predators (I think she had a very bad experience with a pedophile female sports coach as a teenager). One time I accidentally walked in on her getting changed, she implied I was trying to see her naked, as if gay people are incestuous predators.\n\nEvery time something reminds her that I am gay she has a disgusted look on her face, incredibly disgusted. When she remembers what I am, she talks to me as if I sicken her. Where she used to be indifferent to gay people on TV, now she becomes incredibly angry when she sees them, raging and ranting. She looked me in the eye and told me that bisexuals (what I am) are the worst of all, because they have a choice to be straight and do not take it. \"They are the worst sinners of all. They are disgusting,\" she said, glaring at me. She's a very religious christian.\n\nMy phone needed a new password, an important date. The only important date I have is the day I started dating my friend (who I am now only allowed to see very very rarely, and only in a group of multiple people). I stupidly made that my password. She immediately figured out what it was and was very angry, and had that disgusted face again. She immediately punished me for something else very minor (borrowing a coat from her that she gave me permission to borrow, she told me I was now banned from wearing it and took it back). Not a crazy punishment like beating me, just taking something away, but it hurts because it shows me how much she hates me for being gay.\n\nA month ago, my hairdresser accidentally cut my hair too short (I asked for collar bone length, she cut too much off one side and had to do a chin length/mid-neck bob- it's a shitty salon). She was furious and upset, saying I look like an ugly dyke, saying I cannot go there again because they want me to look like a lesbian.\n\nI think I'm forgetting a lot of instances, but hopefully you get the idea. The worst thing, the thing that makes me cry, is the betrayed, sickened look in her eyes and the way her mouth twists up with disgust.\n\nSometimes she is angrily in denial \"You have too many male friends to be a lesbian. You must secretly like them.\" Or she is trying to set me up with a boy- e.g. \"Oh, that male friend of yours, you should date him!\" \"Which boy would you date, this or this?\" \"You should go on a date with my friend's son\". She says this knowing full well that I am (in theory, not in practice, as I never see her) dating my friend. As much as she wants it, she doesn't know how to forcefully split us up. We can still text and see each other at school.\n\nI never bring up anything remotely to do with gay stuff around her. I never give her a reason to say this, I am constantly walking on eggshells, and sometimes she forgets all about the gay matter. Then she acts like a lovely, amazing mother, helping me with things, buying me surprise gifts etc. 50% of the time she is a great, loving mother. But I am afraid of her the other 50%. \n\nShe has forbidden me from telling anyone I am gay. She is adamant that no-one, especially her friends can ever find out. This is incredibly important to her. Those of my friends who I have secretly told or have figured out, I have sworn to secrecy. \n\nMy dad is very accepting of gay people. He is incredibly smart, a genius with genuinely an IQ of something well over 130, possibly 150 I can't remember what, but it's very high. He's logical and knows there is nothing wrong with being gay and homosexuality is not a disgusting sex act, unlike my mother (she cannot separate the concepts of gayness and sex, eg. two men holding hands \"it's disgusting to broadcast in public what you do in the bedroom\"). But he has autism and is a big pushover, he lets this happen. It's not his fault, I don't think he realises how much my mum's treatment of me upsets me, or the extent of it. I love him to pieces and I don;t blame him for allowing anything to happen.\n\nI know it doesn't sound like much, but every day she makes a little comment about gay people, every day I see her disgust at me. To have my own mother disgusted by me, it drives me to tears when I lie in bed at night.\n\nI don't know what I should do. This is eating away at me.", "subreddit": "abuse"}

How could it? And once I realized what he was really looking for was an audience for the story he was creating a lot of little comments that I had previously mistaken for love we're just more evidence that he wanted an audience. \nHe asked me for a blow job and I told him I wasn't ready. Instead of apologizing for pushing my boundaries he apologized for coming off as crass. \nWhen I told him that when he cancels on events that my friends are going to and I have to tell them that I don't know where he is because he never properly canceled he didn't apologize for bailing on me. He apologized for the fact that my friends thought he didn't care enough to come. \nI had thought these apologies we're sincere and a sign that he wanted to be good but now I see that they were just a means to get himself back into the hero role.  \nI was only able to come to these realizations after accepting that he wasn't good for me. So I'm glad I made the decision not to trust him. The proof that backed up my choice came after the fact. \nHe acted like this hopeless romantic who wanted nothing more than a grand romance and despite me being sexually and romantically into him, and him saying he was sexually and romantically into him it wasn't enough. And I'm sure it wasn't because I refused to fuck him because he wasn't looking for a relationship.

I used to keep a f\\*\\*\\*ing diary to prove to myself that I'd done things...\n\nI'd be ordered about like a servant. I'd be called out in public if I didn't toe the line, and yelled at in private if there was something - no matter how small - I'd forgotten to do.

I had one of those moments earlier. My ex when we first started speaking on line never believed I worked. I had worked for 20 years at the same company and she just wouldn't believe me. It took about 2 years for her to accept that I did work and this was after I took pictures and showed her a magazibe. I could never understand why she never believed me. I was thinking earlier about when she showed me a conversation she had with a guy on Facebook who she didn't even know in real life. He asked what she did for a living. She told him she worked in a bank when she had actually been unemployed for 6 years and only ever had a temp job. So her accusing me of lying about not working was clear projection. It made me think about what else she had lied about. \n\nOne thing that I just don't understand and I'd love some ideas is the following. Before we split she mentioned that her sister was on tinder. I said oh right ok. I just thought she was making conversation. We split and she made a new Facebook profile. She tried adding me but I declined. She knew I was looking on her Facebook I'm pretty sure cause she had everything set to public which wasn't like her. Anyway I looked on her Facebook and she had posted something about that she had found out that someone had made a dating profile up in her name and with her pictures. She went on to say that who ever did it was sick and she was telling the authorities. It just seemed odd and how she seemed to be really trying to get the point across that it wasn't her. I know she was very capable of lying so I didn't believe a word she was saying. Maybe she was on a dating site when we were dating and she thought I may have found out and she was trying to cover her tracks i don't know. She was always accusing me of talking online to women when I wasn't. It doesn't really matter now but it makes me feel a little better when I find things that proves she was up to no good.", "subreddit": "NarcissisticAbuse"}

I found it odd because I didn't know if women sexually harassing men was very common.  I thought maybe he led her on and she misunderstood?...then I thought he was maybe flipping the script and maybe he was the one reported?......now I think he was leading her on and falsely accused her so he could use it as leverage to get the company to give him a pay raise or something. (I really wanted to talk about this one because it's been 12 years and I think about it sometimes)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\-He's accused me on more than one occasion of stealing money from him. When he was deployed out of no where I received a legal document stating he was seeking a legal separation due to I stole $16,000. We did not have that kind of money. In fact, he was an E3 and it was only 8 weeks into the deployment when he sent me this accusation. Anyone that knows anything about military and pay, he didn't make that kind of money in 8 weeks. He accuses quite a few people of stealing money from him without evidence.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\-He used my credit lines to invest in his rental properties. When it comes time to pay the bills he accuses me of running up my credit so irresponsibly. Even though I show him proof that I never used any of my credit lines on shopping or anything dumb, he still discredits me. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\-He's accused friends of stealing things from our room. At the time of the accusations we were moving and everything was boxed up in a moving truck. He accused a buddy of stealing a sports card out of one of the moving boxes. The friend was no where near us during this time. I think N misplaced it because he does not take care of his things. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\-Of course I've been accused of being a \"lying, cheating, dirt bag with a wondering eye\". (I have never, ever cheated) This has been a never ending accusation. I am currently being discarded because I went home for an Easter family  dinner. He was asked to come but started a fight.  He saw pictures on social media and saw my cousin and her husband was there. He has always accused me of wanting other women's husbands, especially ones in my family......even my own male cousins.

[Long Post]", "author": "Shay_Mar", "self_text": "I(21F) grew up in an extremely abusive household, but no one would guess it because they never saw that side of my family. I was taught to cover my issues so well that  everyone I meet would never guess I was so horribly abused, and sometimes when I finally trust someone enough to open up about it, they are shocked and I honestly don't think they really believe me.\n\n I decided to finally say everything I feel I have needed to open up about and I hope it helps someone realize that they are not alone and that it does get better if you take the big scary steps OUT. \n\n\nMy Mother was physically abusive and my father was an alcoholic. My mother had grown up in a horribly abusive household with three brothers. She was tough. She also knew how to fight. \n\nMy father worked away from home in the oilfield, and when he did have time off he partied and cheated and gambled. My dad was very absent. Even the times he was home were spent in the arms of his recliner, watching Nascar and nursing his hangover. The good memories I do have of my father growing up were of bonfires out in our yard, listening to old rock music and talking to him. He would actually talk to us when he was drunk, and we didn't understand that he didn't remember anything until years later. \n\nMy mother and father were extremely abusive to each other until I was around four. We would hear them screaming and beating each other up in the kitchen late at night from our bedroom in the tiny trailer house we lived in. The walls were thin and I remember the screaming vividly. \n\nThe abuse for us kids started so young I don't remember it starting. I was extremely young. Maybe Three? I'm not sure. It started with what she called \"spankings\". She would scream at us for whatever we had done to displease her and then grab us and proceed to give us all spankings. She would hit you until her hand hurt and then get mad at you for that, and then grab the next kid. She started using wooden spoons. I don't remember how old I was I just remember them breaking on my bare bottom and her getting mad at me for breaking her spoons. Making me grab another. Breaking the next one.  \n\nMy mother got mad every day. It was an every day occurence until my sister ran away from home at 16 for us to get beaten. She would call us all in to the kitchen, make us stand side by side and then start by asking us questions we weren't actually allowed to answer.\n\n If we tried she would start screaming in our face. If we didn't answer she would scream in our face. The only thing we could say was \"I'm sorry\" and even that enraged her. When she had finally worked herself into a rage she would start grabbing us. I had waist length hair and she would grab it and shake me around by my hair. She would smash me into the cupboards and rip patches of it out. We weren't allowed to run away. We weren't allowed to complain. Anything but standing was warrant for more abuse. I vividly remember one time where she had shaken me around the kitchen by my hair and smashed me off of the oven multiple times. I had blood and snot pouring out of my nose and she had finally let go of me. That meant I was to stand to the side. She wasn't done, she was now going after a different sibling and if I dared run I'd get tenfold what I'd already received. She turned around and saw the blood and snot on my face and started choking me and screaming in my face about how f***ing stupid I am how stupid I must be to stand there with f***ing snot on my face. \n\nThe abuse got worse until I was almost 7. My sister ran away from home to her best friend's house at the age of 16 and finally told her mom about the abuse, and showed her the bruises all over her body from the night before's beating. My sister's mom's friend called CPS. CPS had my sister move in with my auntie. \n\nI remember my mother showing up to my aunties house and screaming in her face about how she dared take her daughter from her while we sat in the back of the truck.\n\n After that came a summer of swimming lessons and child counseling, where we were brought in every week to a room free of our mother and counseled by a nice women with toys who was trying to ask us questions in just the right way to see if we had been abused. \n\nThe first session was very blunt. I remember my mother telling me before hand that I would be in a room with a stranger and that they were going to ask if mommy hit us, and that I was to say no or we wouldn't get to see mommy any more. I remember the lady asking me if my mom ever spanked me. If she used something other than her hand. If she ever spanked me lots. If I ever felt like I didn't deserve the spanking. I remember answering that sometimes she spanked us. Only a couple taps. Never hard. I always thought I deserved it. \n\nMy little brother had answered differently though, he told them she did hit us. For whatever reason they didn't remove us from her custody that day. Instead came random CPS visits and three months of one on one counseling. I remember how my mother beat choked my little brother and screamed at him after that. He was five.\n\nMy mother was forced to go to anger management courses for a couple years and take meds. They helped for a few years and I remember feeling happier during that time period. Things were still horrible, but they weren't as far gone as before, and I didn't know better. I thought getting hit once a week was better. \n\nMy mother homeschooled me from grade three up and moved us all an hour out of town when I was 11. The abuse started getting worse again after that point. It involved more manipulation and control of where we were allowed to go or who we were allowed to see than previous though. She had one daughter escape because she had friends. She made sure I didn't have any connections outside of the house that weren't fully monitored by her constantly. When I finally did get a phone she would change my passwords, go through all of my conversations and get mad no matter what. Deleting the majority of my friends list was a weekly occurence. \n\nHighschool was hell. Age 15 came and I begged my parents to let me go to regular school. In my mind if I could only get out for a few days I could find someone to stay with. Someone safe to talk to. I could run away. My mother forbid it and my father never fought it. It was around this age I finally got up the courage to tell my dad about what was going on at home. However each time I did, he wouldn't go a rant about how he had no where to go, and the next morning he'd act completely normal again. That's when I learned he was so drunk he didn't remember anything I'd said. I stopped telling him after that. \n\nBy age 15 my mother was so depressed she stayed in bed most of the time. My job was to get the chores done, feed the farm animals, help my little brother with his schooling, wake my mother up, cook lunch, complete my own schooling, and cook supper. I had no social life and one friend only through text. \n\nAge 16 I became extremely resentful of my mother. I became sneaky and angry. I made some friends at a bible study group my mother allowed to go to at the neighbor's house and started sneaking out see my best friend late at night. I had my mom's schedule down pat and was so good about detail she didn't catch me for over a year. During the day I would do everything she wanted, take the beatings and then sneak out late at night and meet up with my best friend, who would just drive me around and let me cry if I needed to, or scream, or take me to bonfires to feel slightly normal for a couple hours before I had to go home again. My grades subsequently dropped from my straight A average that year, and I remember getting the shit kicked out of me for it and not caring at all. I remember screaming back for the first time. I remember her crying. I remember feeling terrible and angry all at once. \n\nMy 17th birthday was terrible. Someone shot my horse three days before, standing in our field and that broke me. My birthday came and went and my parents fought. I caught my dad cheating on my mother and she made me show her the details. She then decided to tell me in that moment that my father was also a cross dresser. It was a HUGE mind-f***. \n\nI left home a week after all of that happened and moved into town with my auntie, the same one who had helped my sister years before. I started my first real job a day later and went through an extremely drunk and angry year of hating my life and everything I had been dealt. I dated a couple losers that broke my heart. It was horrible. However I slowly got my shit together and the feeling of being my own person and making my own opinions was amazing. I got my own place and bought a dog! I was super proud of myself. \n\nI got into a toxic relationship right after that and found out I was pregnant. I stayed for far too long until I finally realized I had fallen back in to a vicious cycle of abuse I would never break unless I left. I left and took by this point my two very young children with me. \n\nI worked three jobs for a year. I built my own business. I made some really amazing friends. I met an absolutely amazing man:) I fell in love with actually living and being  myself. \n \nLife has honestly been hell for so many years. I am so extremely grateful for my children. I have no idea what path I would have ended up on if not for them. They have always been my reason for bettering myself, for learning better coping mechanisms and fighting to create an amazing life for them, to let the cycle and the generations of abuse end with me. \n\nI have never written this all out before, especially in this much detail, and while I know it's insanely long, I hope someone reads it ands gets something out of it. I wish I hadn't felt so alone all those years. I don't know if this all goes away eventually or not but I do know that life was worth all the risks\u2665\ufe0f", "subreddit": "abuse"}
{"post_id": "bgs8gt", "created_utc": 1556095468, "title": "Need help coming to terms with possible marital sexual", "author": "Annon_12345", "self_text": "... maritial sexual abuse (title got cut off )\n\nI\u2019m going to try to keep this as short as possible. But I\u2019m starting to realize that I have been in a possible abusive relationship. It\u2019s really hard for me to state that and I\u2019m feeling like I need outside perspective because this is new to me and it\u2019s like a veil is being lifted. \nI\u2019ve been married for 5 years. \nMy husband was my first and only sexual partner. Which for me could be why I didn\u2019t realize what I was experiencing was abuse because it\u2019s all I\u2019ve ever know and I have nothing to compare it to. \n\nAfter our first time having sex. I my heart didn\u2019t feel good. But I never understood why. The experience itself was not good and literally felt like I was being used rather than loved. I was flipped and turned and twisted into millions of positions and I think my mind has even blocked the details of the experience. I did not feel cherished to say the least. And the whole honeymoon was constant, constant, constant sex. \n\nThis was my new normal. Even early on I began hating his touch and I didn\u2019t know why. He was always very sexual with me and would constantly touch me sexually and I told him multiple times please don\u2019t touch me like that I\u2019m not comfortable with it. And he never listened. He would always say \u201cit\u2019s just you are so hot I can\u2019t help it\u201d so in a way it was flattering but also demeaning. It was like I was conditioned to believe that sexual violations were because he just thought I was so beautiful and attractive. \n\nAnytime I told him I was uncomfortable with how he touched me he NEVER listened. And it was confusing because I knew I was his wife and I had always thought that when I was married I would enjoy sex and sexuality but I wasn\u2019t enjoying it. And I felt confused l, and bad and like I was letting him down. He would get so disappointed when I refused him and would guilt me and I would feel so bad. \n\nI also need to mention he refused to fulfill any of my emotional needs. It\u2019s was like once we were married a switch flipped and he didn\u2019t listen to me, didn\u2019t want me to speak, didn\u2019t care about my emotions, and would often be angry and distant. Basically I was like an invisible person who was an inconvenience if I opened my mouth or had feelings but was expected to always be sexually available. \n\nWhen I got pregnant I fell debilitating ill. I was in and out of the hospital and bed ridden. I lost extreme amount of weight and was emaciated and unable to eat and drink or care for myself. I was bed ridden and hooked up to a IV line that gave me nutrients. Even in the horrible state he would come in and have sex with me. Of course 100% unwanted because what person in that kind of state would want to have sex. I was barely surviving and he would come in and say here let me make you feel better. I was limp because I was so weak and I just lay there as he had sex with me. These were the darkest times of my life because i was so ill alone, and confined to a bed. I felt trapped. And he didn\u2019t care about my physical state all he cared about was having sex. Of course this dehumanized me and almost made me feel like a sex slave. Confined to a room to weak to even care. \nAfter I had the baby I suffered a horrible tear and I injured myself greatly during labor due to being basically in such poor physical shape. I could barely walk and when I say the pain was excruciating I mean it. I was even afraid to have anyone in my proximity because even the slightest bump against my body was unfathomably painful. Yet he insisted on grinding on me in bed to the point where I had to put a barrier of pillows to protect myself. \u201cI can\u2019t help it \u201c he would say. \n\nTime passed and he was still emotionally detached. To me , to the baby, to everything except his own personal desires. And he would tell me that if I had more sex with him he would be able to talk to me and connect. That it\u2019s because I don\u2019t have enough sex with him doesn\u2019t feel loved. That he needs sex and that\u2019s why he is so emotionally detached. He would tell me I don\u2019t love him. And I would tell him an emotional connection is what makes a healthy love life and he would insist that I was being selfishly minded and that my way isn\u2019t always the right way. And so I began to think it was my fault and that I lacked loving him and that I was the reason he couldn\u2019t connect to me and I needed to be more sexual even though I felt degraded and used and disposable. \n\nThen I found out about the porn addiction and masturbation. This had been an addiction since before we got married. \n\nOf course I was so hurt and betrayed. But somehow he made me feel like it was my fault and that I didn\u2019t understand him and that I caused him so much pain and that he couldn\u2019t turn to me. And that it was my fault he was isolated. And I began to feel so bad that I didn\u2019t love him in the ways he needed to be loved and I forced him to seek gratification through other means. That because I was so sick and still recovering from those health complications that I was a disappointment to him. What did I expect him to do. My sickness hard driven him to this point. My lack had made him desperate. This is what I believed. \n\nAnd so I tried to fix it. \nHe would tell me what I needed to do that would help him including making sex tapes and having him film me and photograph me in sex acts and positions. Let me say I HATED this. And he knew it. I have told him I really don\u2019t want to do this. But he made me believe that he needed this so he could look at me and not other women. And so of course in fear that he would resort to looking at other women in porn I degraded myself. \n\nAnd it was like always more more more. More pictures more sex more videos it was never enough. Always asking for more and making me feel guilty. \nand of course he didn\u2019t stop lookin at porn. \n \n\nI always wondered why after the birth of my first. Why I never fully felt myself and why I couldn\u2019t feel connected to anything. It seemed like everything I loved to do I couldn\u2019t feel the joy in anything. And it has never fully come back \n\nAnyway he is in counseling now. But all of this just came back to me and I never really put a title on it but could this be sexual abuse. I like oddly don\u2019t even want to own that title. But I know if true healing is to come I need to identify the truth. I just don\u2019t want to admit it. \n\nThere are good things about him too. I hate to say all the bad things. But it\u2019s so complex. I just also wonder is there any salvaging this? Like he killed my heart and degraded and demeaned me. But he didn\u2019t even realize he was doing it and he is now learning about his unhealthy mindset and habits and trying to change them.", "subreddit": "abuse"}

I broke up with my narc Feb 16th, so a little over two months ago. I\u2019ve gotta be honest, the first month was terrible. The trauma bond was real strong and not hanging out with him basically every day took a toll on me. I was so wrapped up within him I didn\u2019t know what doing things for just me felt like anymore. I got very depressed about everything, was constantly second guessing my decision. But I knew I chose the right decision when I thought back on it, I was so depressed being with him that I thought about suicide daily (I never told him this because he\u2019d probably use it against me, since he always told me I made him feel like killing himself because I wanted to end the relationship, even though he told me months after this that he\u2019d never kill himself because he holds such high regards for himself...) this made me realize that we shouldn\u2019t be together, cause I was losing my sanity. A good relationship shouldn\u2019t always having you second guessing yourself, being uncomfortable and going \u201ccrazy\u201d. \n\nNow I\u2019m feeling pretty great! I\u2019ve listened to a couple of audiobooks about narcissism. Psychopath free by Jackson McKenzie. And my absolute favorite Dr. Ramani Durvasula\u2019s book Should I stay or should I go? Surviving a relationship with a narcissist. If you haven\u2019t read these I highly recommend them. Dr. Ramani made me come to terms that narcissists will never change and that I can either come to terms with this and lower my expectations, or I can leave the relationship. This made me feel so much better about everything. I left my relationship and I NEVER want to go back to it (for the second time, the first time made me realize that his apology was never sincere and what he said was just love bombing to Hoover me back in and I fell for it). \n\nI work with my narcissist ex. It doesn\u2019t bother me at all because I know, and a couple of other people at work know what he\u2019s all about. I hear stories about him daily, I\u2019m sticking to no contact so I\u2019m not prying into the conversation. After being told a few things I asked co workers to not tell me about him and that I\u2019m trying to move on. They told me he\u2019s already let his ex (the one he told me not to worry about because he hated her) move in with him only two weeks of breaking up, confirming my suspicions. He\u2019s already tried a few low key hoovering attempts. The best part is that my coworkers have noticed this as well and asked me what he was doing. The other day he held the door open for me even though I was pretty far away from the door and waited for me to get to it. Also, when I brings be an order for work and I\u2019m polite and professional he thinks I\u2019m trying to be nice to get back with him, I\u2019m just trying to stay professional so there aren\u2019t any problems in the work place. My coworkers see this and we have a good laugh. I told my coworker it confuses me that he tries to act nice and win me over now that we\u2019re not in a relationship, like he\u2019s trying to win me back, but he snaps be back to reality by saying \u201cif your nex was really a good person he should of treated you nice when you were actually in the relationship and not just when he\u2019s trying to win you back or prove a point, remember how he treated you and went behind your back\u201d  it\u2019s really what I needed to hear because for a second I felt bad like maybe my nex wasn\u2019t so bad after all. This is a faze and I\u2019m aware of it now. I will only accept genuine changed behavior and not words, but I know he will NEVER change. For awhile I felt I\u2019d never move on. But now I\u2019m just happy living my life. Everything is syncing up finally, and I\u2019m moving on. It does get better. Just give it time!", "subreddit": "NarcissisticAbuse"}

There\u2019s no way you can go to that level of cheating and deception when you\u2019re seeing someone on a regular basis. She\u2019ll be with him. His phone will buzz when she\u2019s around.

There will be stages you must pass through in order to truly heal from this event, and right now you are in the stage of grief. That is okay. It is also okay to pass through stages of anger, or fear, or downright confusion. It's okay to oscillate between these stages, phase out of them, and find yourself right back where you started, because this is not a linear process. This is a messy, complicated, personal process that only you can truly understand. There won't be easy answers. There won't be convenient resolutions. This will be difficult, painful, and arduous. But you will survive it. And you will recover. That much, I can guarantee.\n\nAs a victim of abuse, there is an enormous amount of pressure to hold the belief that you are \"above\" your abuser, and that you can dismiss any positive feelings or shrug off the pain of separation more easily because they were cruel and manipulative, or had poor intentions. This simply isn't the case. Relationships that suffer from abuse aren't going to operate under different models of grief and loss simply because they were harmful. You're allowed to miss your abuser. You're allowed to wish things had been different. You're allowed to feel lonely or helpless or furious or empowered or anything in between because this is \\*your\\* recovery process. Fuck this idea that once the abuser is gone the damage is over--it isn't. You're going to hurt for a while. But you're also going to recover with a hell of a lot of new perspective.\n\nThere's light out there, and goodness. There are people who will be eager to love you, care for you, and work with you as a teammate rather than against you as an adversary in a relationship.\n\nI hope, sincerely, that you come into this realization yourself someday soon, and that it brings you peace.

I've been reading through some of these posts and I'm shaking, crying, ready to vomit, and wanting to break things.  I realized that it is right around the seven year anniversary of when my ex-husband ruined my life completely.  It's a long post; I hope you can bear with me.\n\nI was with my ex for almost fifteen years since we were both teens.  We were married, divorced, and remarried.  I knew what a rotten human being he was pretty early on because he threw a vase at me and cut off my toe.  I knew he was a liar, a cheater, and a sadist.  But my only other option at the time was to live with my abusive narcissist mother, and I wanted out of that situation SO badly that I ended up moving on to a new life with another abusive narcissist.  Isn't life grand?  Isn't psychology wonderful?\n\nShortly after my ex and I moved in together, I was in a serious car accident and was disabled.  I was unable to work and thus unable to get free, and I had nowhere else to go.  He lied all the time about everything, and then when I didn't trust him, he'd abuse me for not trusting him.  Then we'd have that old familiar cycle of him apologizing for the abuse and promising to do better.\n\nI was always told that I deserved it all.  I was constantly berated, insulted, attacked, and gaslighted.  He'd move the goalposts constantly; if I completed \"x\" task or \"y\" behavior, then he wouldn't be abusive anymore.  I could never tell when his mood would shift.  I'd wake up in the morning and creep downstairs trying to sense what kind of mood he was in that day.  It's like eventually you learn to physically FEEL that black aura before you enter the room, isn't it?\n\nWhen we divorced the first time, it was basically because he got angry and wanted to \"punish\" me, so he left in August, we divorced in October, but then he was back in the house by February.  I HATED him by then.  There was only a sliver of love left for him at all.  But again, I had no options.  I couldn't even get disability due to a dumb loophole about the timing of when I got disabled.  \n\nOnce again, I had to choose between staying with him or living with my mother, and at least I'd have money to live on and my own home if I stayed with my ex.  When he came back after the divorce, he was even more vicious.  He took my car accident settlement and used it to pay for his associate's in nursing.  He moved a male relative of his into our home against my wishes (and I have a long history of sexual abuse and I didn't want ANY other man living in my home!)\n\nHe swore that once he was a nurse he'd be making good money and he wouldn't care that I couldn't work, but as soon as he got a good job as a nurse, then it was all about him getting his BACHELOR'S degree before the abuse would stop.\n\nAnd what happened?  The most shameful, miserable thing possible.  I DID HIS ENTIRE DEGREE FOR HIM.  It was all online and doing research papers, so he was able to get away with it.  I got him a perfect 4.0 too (and I'm not even in a medical field whatsoever, so that's kind of disturbing).\n\nI was commuting many hours a day at the same time because I was also in an Ivy League graduate program of my own.  My health had been ever so slightly better at the time, but I started to break down under that workload.  In addition to the car accident issues, I started having serious symptoms that I knew were going to be autoimmune related.  Fevers, falls, fingers so swollen I couldn't type, and constant PTSD and anxiety was my whole life.  And I'd come home just to be abused some more.\n\nWe got remarried.  He demanded that we move across the country, and because his bachelor's was done, he was going to \"make it all about\" me and \"support\" me.  Immediately after moving out here, he ran off with his new friends and left me to rot.  At this point I was diagnosed with several major autoimmune conditions in addition to needing significant back surgery.  Then I also developed a rare neurological condition that caused constant miserable pain and disability in one foot and ankle.\n\nI was on my laptop one day and he got angry, so he wrenched it from my hand and beat me with it.  I tried to call the cops and he threatened to blackmail me.  So I was suffering and he didn't have any further use for me, he had his new lovely life, and so then he decided to leave.  Now, he could have been a decent human being and come to me and said he wanted a divorce, but what did he do?  Run up bills on the credit cards, buy a new car with our savings, and clean out the bank accounts.  \n\nHe gloated about me starving to death in the streets.  He had planned it ALL to make the divorce as painful as possible.  He already had an expensive attorney lined up, so he also got away with absolutely everything in the divorce.  \n\nAnd this was revenge for WHAT?  I never lied or cheated or stole.  I did EVERYTHING he ever wanted and it broke me.  Financially, mentally, emotionally, and physically, he ruined me completely.  Seven years later, and I have not even paid off the debt he left me with.  \n\nEveryone kept saying--and still says--\"karma gets everyone in the end\" or \"he'll never be able to find anyone else to deal with his shit.\"  I avoided looking at him on social media completely because I knew he'd be trying to hurt me, but then my grandmother saw a picture of him on Facebook getting married.  A big goddamm fancy wedding with a ton of our mutual acquaintances.\n\nThe extra cherry on top was that he married  a man!  Now, that doesn't really make matters WORSE, but I can only imagine everyone telling him how \"brave\" he was for coming out (and he's definitely bisexual and not gay because the only normal thing we ever had was our sex life).  Once I found out about the wedding, of course I looked at his social media, and everyone was posting comments like, \"Marriage takes a lot of work\" as though he hadn't already been married TWICE to me and married for MANY YEARS to me!!!\n\n\"The best revenge is living well.\"  That's all fine and dandy, but I don't have the capacity to \"live well.\"  KARMA, yeah.  He's rich and has a new NS hubby to exploit.  He makes a show of doing charity work.  He used to work in a prenatal intensive care ward precisely because it made him better than everyone else (he literally SAID this).  He spends thousands of dollars buying everyone everything so that they'll think he's great.  I also guarantee that very soon he will start adopting a bunch of disabled children from various third world countries to further show his wonderfulness.\n\n\"Everyone has problems in their lives\" or \"you don't know if he's happy.\"  I don't buy it!  Until he, his spouse, or his children get cancer or something, his life is going to be roses. And he didn't even EARN it!  Can you imagine convincing yourself that you are the greatest thing since sliced bread for having a good job when you didnt even DO the degree yourself?\n\nI have done years of therapy.  Had every kind of antidepressant in existence shoved down my throat.  Support groups.  Meditation, yoga, tai chi, positive visualizations, art therapy, even reiki.  If I were healthy and able to be prosperous, maybe it would hurt less over time, but I don't have that option.  I have nightmares about him almost every night.  I want revenge so badly that it is physically painful.\n\nTL;DR  My ex husband ruined my health, profited from me doing his college degree FOR him, destroyed me utterly in the divorce, and has a wonderful life now.  I can't go forward because I have no way of \"living well\" thanks to him.  I have tried everything possible to get past this and I just want him to suffer 1/1000th of what he did to me.", "subreddit": "NarcissisticAbuse"}

(We have been married for 5 years.) If anything happened or he said anything hurtful, he denies it happened and states that I \"must be crazy\"; nothing that has happened is ever a big deal even if it causes me great pain; he will throw the worst tantrum if you dare to provide him with any criticism, but it's OK for him to dish out criticism to me all day every day; he has been very nasty to me in the past year since I got a promotion at work and now make more than him. I also recently successfully defended my doctoral dissertation; I should note that he was the only one who told me that I would never finish the program when I decided to pursue it. All of my co-workers were extremely supportive.\n\nI suffer from depression and PTSD and often have a difficult time with that, and he gets pissed with me when I have episodes because I don't want to leave the house or be social with his friends. He recently told me that I am \"disabled\" because I have a mental illness, but I hold a full-time job! I have no issues doing functional things. And when I confront him about this, all he says is \"No, you are still disabled.\"\n\nI keep going back and forth in my mind to whether I should stay in the marriage because his family is the only family I have as I am estranged from mine due to them being emotionally abusive. I have no friends because all of the friends we have had sided with him due to him talking a lot of crap about me behind my back. Basically, I'm all alone. I have no one. I have no support system or no confidence that I am doing the right or wrong thing. I'm pretty much scared to do anything.\n\nMy spouse and I attend marriage counseling and I recently confronted him with the fact during the course of our 12-year relationship, I felt that he never accepted me. A few weeks ago confirmed my statement that he never accepted me and he has purposely tried to change me over the course of the past 12 years we've been together because he feels that I need to change. He also said he was constantly trying to change me, which I see now because he was always telling me how to act, etc. \n\nFurthermore, he shared that he told a friend of his the only reason why he married me because at that time I was \"the least angry\" with him that I had ever been. (I don't recall ever being extremely angry, but living with someone who constantly makes me redo chores because they aren't up to his unreachable standards is bound to make one crack.)\n\nThis has actually sent me in a tailspin mainly because something I have always believed has been confirmed as being true. I knew all these years I was never good enough, which hurt my self-esteem and sex drive and everything else over the past decade. I asked to talk to him about his not accepting me last week and he doesn't understand why I am so hurt about it. He doesn't think it is a big deal at all and told me to \"just get over it.\" Yesterday, he told me \"I wish I never told you that because you are still moping around about it.\"\n\nI just don't know what to think about all of this. Is this emotional abuse? My personal therapist says yes, but I brought it up in marriage counseling and was basically belittled. I feel like I am going crazy. I keep thinking about leaving for real, but then I think maybe I am actually legit crazy. I am also in hell and I don't think I will ever truly be happy. Again, I am in therapy. I should also note that I have no family to turn to. I am basically all alone. All of my friends think my spouse is \"great\" but they haven't seen how he treats me when no one else is around. All I know is that I am the most depressed I have ever been in my whole entire life.", "subreddit": "emotionalabuse"}

It started as a typical day, I woke up and got dressed for work, I was 12 wks pregnant and had just found out. My boyfriend of 3 years always sat outside of my job and when my shift ended we would go back to the home I was renting at the time. My boyfriend refused to work and I told him that evening that I was pregnant and that he needed to find a job or leave. We had fought about this many times. That day I was stabbed 14 times, and he kicked me before my pitbull broke down the screen door and attacked him. He fled in my truck and I managed to crawl to my neighbors house before passing out. I woke up at the hospital my mother worked at with my mom standing over me and a team of nurses and physicians trying to stabilize me. By some miracle my son was not killed. He did however end up with a brain malformation due to the kick. In the trauma bay a preacher saw me. He only knew that I was a 19 year old pregnant female that had been stabbed multiple times. That preacher felt compelled to pray for me and came to speak with me every day I was there. At 30 wks my son was born and around 2 months later came home. I lost touch with the preacher and when I met my now husband I hadn't thought of the preacher who talked to me in a long time. My now husband and I had been dating for two months and he took me to meet his parents for the first time. My husband's father was the preacher who talked to me at the hospital. My son is 6 years old now, my husband and I have been married 2 years, we have a farm on 60 acres, 2 pit bulls, 3 German shepherds and a rooster for my personal protection as my husband travels for work. I worked for a few years as a phlebotomist and just left my job to be a stay at home mom. I took self defense classes and bought myself a weapon. My ex is in prison and is unlikely to get out any time soon. During his parole he raped and tortured 3 children. My scars are a constant reminder of him but also a reminder to me that I am much stronger than I realize. I am slowly getting back to normal and decided to wear a bikini last year without being so self conscious of my scars. I still have dreams and I still have panic attacks over that day but I am better and stronger than I ever was. Honestly I thank my ex because had he not done to me what he did I would not be where I am today.\n\nEdit:  I think the hardest part for me with the aftermath of that final fight was the scars. I have a glass eye on the left side, I had 2 cuts to the face one of which took my left eye, 5 to my back, 3 to my right arm, 1 on my left leg, and 3 to my abdomen. For a long time I struggled with depression. I was afraid of everything and have been accused of being a helicopter mom(I'm working on that). I refuse to think of myself as a victim though. I lived, I came out stronger and I know that no matter what happens I can handle it.

There is some missing context, but it's easier if people ask me questions instead of me trying to fill in the details because this is long.\n\n[N] continued a pattern of blaming me for not understanding what she meant, rather than thinking that maybe she could have done better.  I was afraid to speak up for myself.\n\n&gt; To [N] by [Me] on 2014-07-12 19:01:00 UTC Link to this\nI am sorry that I let my frustrations get the better of me. \n\n&gt; When you denied my first request, my head had already started to clog with ideas in the first month, and it was already causing anxiety. I couldn't find a prompt that would work with my main team, especially when I learn who they are by working with them. I should've explained this instead of breaking the rule about writing missions without permission. I figured that I would be okay with you being wrong about me being one of those people who get permission and never do anything with it, but that was a mistake and I should have argued from the beginning.\n\n&gt; Once I was breaking the rule, I shouldn't have tried to hide it since it was just building my frustrations that I couldn't ask for more specific help.\n\n&gt; When I finally found something to wedge in as a random prompt and asked for permission again, and you just said \u201csomething's missing\u201d twice instead of explaining what the problem is, then admitting that you were waiting for me to figure it out on my own, that pressed my berserk button. I shouldn't have ignored that to let it fester.\n\n&gt; I am sorry for building up this image in my mind of you being someone who likes having that sort of power over someone. I shouldn't have gotten upset with imagining that you'd reject my prompts simply because they don't follow the instructions exactly. \n\n&gt; And when I went crazy it shouldn't have been at you.\n\n&gt;&gt; I would like to accept your apology. by [N] on 2014-07-14 22:26:00 UTC Link to this\nAnd I do appreciate the effort that went into making it. I acknowledge that you are struggling with something I don't understand, and I will try to be mindful of that in the future.\n\n&gt;&gt; However, I won't accept blame for something that isn't true. You assert that I \"just said 'something's missing' twice instead of explaining what the problem [was].\" That is false. My exact words from your latest Permission thread, with the parts meant to tell you exactly what I wanted underlined:\n\n&gt;&gt; First response - \"Yeah, I'm just waiting for the second prompt to be posted. ... 'Cause, y'know, writing-wise, we specifically ask for character bios, a response to one of four control prompts, and a response to one of the random prompts from the table.\" \nYou had already posted your character bios and Samantha's recruitment story (a control prompt response; the first type of prompt I named in my post) to the Board, so I thought it would be clear that the random prompt response (the second type of prompt I named in my post) was the missing element of your request. However, you said in your reply that Samantha's recruitment was the second prompt, so I tried to explain again, drawing a contrast between what you had already posted and what I wanted to highlight the missing piece:\n\n[For Context, someone else had said xi wanted the second prompt and gave me the context that they had the random prompt response.  I made sure to include the control prompt, but missed the random prompt when I had to resubmit everything from the beginning.  The instructions were badly-written and I hadn't realized at the time why I kept screwing up.]\n\n&gt;&gt; Second response - \"In that case, I'm waiting for the first one. ... Because \"character bios, one control prompt, and one piece of fanfic\" is not the same as \"character bios, one control prompt, and one random prompt from the table.\" So far, you've provided the former; I'm looking for the latter.\" \nAt that point you DID post a random prompt response, so it seems like I successfully got the point across.\n\n[What happened was that I was going into meltdown and couldn't understand what she wanted and instead of posting so in frustration, I looked at the problem three times and decided to go through everything from scratch.]\n\n&gt;&gt; Furthermore, I outlined the PGs' expectations for a Permission request in my first response to your first request, and it's all explained via the Permission article on the wiki, specifically point 4 in the \"How Do I Get Permission?\" section, and in the linked \"36 Permission Prompts\" document, which you must have looked at in order to come to the conclusion that you couldn't find a random prompt you liked. (I can highlight passages from the linked stuff as I did with my posts above, if that would be helpful.)\n\n&gt;&gt; So, while again, I do appreciate the attempt to make amends, and I want to be understanding about your personal difficulties, it's impossible for me to overlook your statement that I didn't tell you what I wanted. I certainly did, and I had every reason to believe that you would understand what I was talking about because a) I explained it to you after your first Permission request, and b) what's required in a Permission request is explained in documents that people are expected to read and understand before applying. Therefore, I would like you to withdraw the statement, at which point I will be happy to shake hands (so to speak) and move on.\n\n&gt;&gt; ~[N]\n\n&gt;&gt; P.S. I wasn't the only one you went off on. I think [V] and [E] also deserve an apology for being ranted at when they were being perfectly reasonable toward you.\n\n&gt; Okay by [Z] on 2014-07-17 17:20:00 UTC Link to this\n&gt; What happened was not intentional on your part, which was the heart of the problem.\n\n&gt;&gt;&gt; Certainly [V], but I wasn't exactly ranted at. (nm) by [E] on 2014-07-15 03:30:00 UTC Link to this\n\n[Which, I didn't understand that apologies are still required for things that are accidental, but N hadn't made one either.]", "subreddit": "NarcissisticAbuse"}

I also heard about what a disaster his current life is and the messed up brand new relationship he has. I felt a little smug and a little sorry for him at the same time.

He was always kind of a negative guy and a little mean towards other people. But all in all, he was generally a good friend towards me and our mutual friends, so that's why we stayed friends for so long. Until the last couple of years, our friendship started to deteriorate and eventually led me to cutting him off. Here's what happened:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA couple of years ago I decided I was going to make some changes in my life. I went back to school for something I was interested in, picked up some new hobbies, started traveling more, even made some new friends. Basically started doing my own thing more and more. Which led to me hanging out with this friend a little less. The more independent I became it seemed the angrier he would get. This reached its climax last summer when he invited me bowling one Friday night, when I told him I was busy working on a school project that weekend it infuriated him so much that it began a months-long feud with him(mostly just from his end).  He began sending me very negative texts, and if I ignored them it would anger him more and lead to personal attacks. He then began monitoring everything I did on social media, to the point where he was acting like a creepy stalker. Or if I posted a school project or a travel photo to my social media he would text me right away something negative to try and get under my skin.  I eventually had enough and had to block him from all social media.  But I kept his number unblocked so he could still text/call me. Until the straw that broke the camels back. He sent me a text along the lines of \"I'm the only person that's nice to you, if it wasn't for me you would have no friends.\" I blocked his number and haven't looked back since. Other than seeing him at a mutual friends Christmas party back in December I've been NC with him. \n\nGenerally, I've found my mental health has improved drastically since I don't have to play his constant mind games.", "subreddit": "NarcissisticAbuse"}

I thought he's not a good listener and thats why I dont feel satisfied, not that he is a Narcissist. He's also an introverted, covert Narcissist.\n\nI let him get really close. I wanted him as a close friend. I'd still like to keep him as a friend, but I understand now, that (even though I dont hate him because it feels like he doesn't get what he's doing) I want normal relationships and normal relationships aren't possible with him, athough I'm lost at how to communicate this to him.\n\nAgain, its all my fault, apparently was not serious enough about my boundaries. I also wasn't serious about the abuse, I may even liked it or at least tolerated it - didn't take it serious. So is it even abuse? Never appeared like I really mind his faking, played with it, but I also never cleary saw it as that. The fog I just accepted as normal part of our interactions, not manipulation. I was always suspcious of him, but thought it has to do with me. You know, it was fun, I wanted to figure out what it was.  Thats part of the problem, I didn't take the abuse seriously, but suddenly I do.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAny help is appreciated!", "subreddit": "NarcissisticAbuse"}

The last straw for me was when she physically assaulted my friend. After I ended the friendship she launched an entire smear campaign about me and did the typical narcissist thing, I had her blocked and I ignored it all. Things died down and then she had her friend come to my job last year basically to try and humiliate me? Or basically make me feel like I wasn't safe anywhere. I actually work at a new job and I live in an entirely new apartment so she has no idea where I live or work now. \n\nSo I had her blocked, and then recently an old co-worker who isn't friends with her but used to work with her, told me she had taken down her Instagram and made a new one. I know that she has been stalking my media ever since I cut her off. Now that she has a new social media, she doesn't have me blocked and I feel like she's knowingly keeping me unblocked to either hoover me or try and show off her life to me.\n\n I haven't seen her social media in a **VERY** long time, and I'd like to keep it that way, I always felt like she was trying to compete with me even when were friends. My thing is, i'm not sure if I should re-block her? I really want to, but i don't want her to think that I've been stalking her profile or seeking her out and that's how i found her new one. i don't want her to take that as a sign that she matters to me and that she can try and snake her way back in my life. \n\nIn my logic, I feel like if I keep her unblocked it'll seem as though i know nothing about her or her new profile, but it makes me uncomfortable that she has such easy access to my life. I should also mention that she now has ANOTHER Instagram page on top of the new one she just made, it's her stripper page. I would have to block her on that one as well, but once again I fear she'll think I'm interested in her life enough to seek out her new profiles and block her.

My previous relationships may not have been with a narc but I was never treated well and put up with a lot. The narc was the final straw and I realised I needed to take some time alone, learn to enjoy my own company and gain some real self-respect.\n\nI felt 'cold' for a very long time even after I decided to start dating again. I couldn't get attached to anyone new and couldn't develop any real feelings, even if they were great guys.

I also spent a lot of time 'rewiring' my brain to undo my 'coldness' towards men.\n\nI finally met a guy I really liked not long ago. Attractive, funny, yadeeyadeeya. Not a narc (still gotta keep those eyes peeled) but I knew he didn't want the same things I wanted. He was after a no strings attached sexual relationship whereas I am looking for love. I could have very easily slipped back into my old ways and continued to date him in the hopes that things would turn out how I wanted, especially as I felt confident he wasn't a narc. Give more and get very little/nothing back. I decided to ignore my temporary feelings, despite it being so long since I genuinely liked someone, and politely turn him down for future dates. \n\nI felt sad over this guy who I only had a couple of dates with. At first I was annoyed at myself for feeling this way after everything I had been through but then I realised my sadness was in no way connected to my narc ex. I was ONLY sad about this guy and, this may seem like a huge contradiction, that made me ecstatic.\n\nI'm over it. I'm done. Part of me wishes I'd done no contact sooner but if I'd had managed that, there probably wouldn't have been anywhere near as much work to do.

This could be anything from raging out of house, silent treatment, starting fights for imaginary other reasons, etc to even leaving me stranded in other states as punishment. He was also a severe sex/porn addict which I know is common in NPD. It took me a long time to realize it was the only way he could regulate, but I think that sex is the only way he could handle the turmoil inside him.

I know they butt heads when it comes to his business bc he undermines her, even though I highly suspect that his success in that area is bc of her.

He secretly watched porn 3-5x a day and constantly talked about women everywhere he went. They are purely sex objects to him and I know if he talked to her like that she wouldn\u2019t be with him. I know he felt more comfortable with me and told me things he never would have said to her and I for years I kept my opinions and judgments to myself because I felt like it was shitty (and not my place) to criticize him when he was just being honest with me.

I had many suspicions as to what actually happened, and I suspected that she had cheated on me.\n\nI talked to a friend of mine yesterday, who is friends with a friend of my nex\u2019s (we all go to the same college/university), and she basically confirmed all of my suspicions. My nex had fallen in love with a guy in Italy and started dating him, which prompted her to then dump me. I learned then that she had lied to me and many other people. She\u2019s told several people, including some of my friends here, that we had never dated, even though we were together (collectively) for at least a year.

I told him I wasn\u2019t overly comfortable meeting in public as I was still feeling pretty emotional and knew there was a high risk of me breaking down. Of course he knew this and wanted me to be publicly humiliated. Basically I was right, I cried, he screamed at me - yep, in public. A few waitresses came up and asked was I okay, did I need anything etc. \n\nThis time I\u2019m feeling a lot stronger and I\u2019m now able to push back against his manipulation. \n\nHere\u2019s how our text conversation went:\n\n\nMe: what\u2019s happening this evening?\n\nNex: we\u2019ll meet at [public department store with a cafe\n\nMe: the cafe part will be closed by the time I\u2019m off work. What about a Starbucks or something. \n\nNex: no, we will go to the closed cafe and sit in the seats.

So he insisted on meeting in public last time, he acted like an asshole, it blew up in his face. He\u2019s speaking as if it was me that insisted on meeting in public, as if I cried to deliberately make him look bad, etc etc. Usual Narc shit. \n\nSo he\u2019s now so desperate for control because I\u2019m disagreeing with his orders that he\u2019s making nonsensical ones like MEETING IN A CAFE THATS CLOSED!? Also, he\u2019s flattering himself in thinking that I\u2019ll give him the satisfaction of crying in front of him ever again. \n\nI feel good having gained back a little confidence, and being able to laugh at his ridiculousness and manipulation rather than get sucked in. A few months ago I\u2019d have apologised for crying the last time, begged to see him sooner, and so on. This is proof to me that I\u2019m healing, and reinforcement that I\u2019ve made the right decision.

I\u2019ll update if anything interesting happens \ud83d\ude02\n\nEdit; typos.\n\nEDIT; well I gray rocked, it scared the shit out of him, I told him I didn\u2019t want to be with him as a couple and I was only interested in him being civil enough with me to organise visitation. Cue Narc rage, long story short it ended with physical abuse! In public! Lmfao. Again. \n\nI cut contact with him completely. I don\u2019t think I\u2019m going to get visitation with my stepchildren unfortunately. That\u2019s a massive hole in my heart. But I knew in a way he was going to use them as pawns to control me. Which just isn\u2019t fair for them at all, even if I were to disregard myself. I will love them always but their father is just too toxic for me to communicate with. I cherish the time I spent raising them. I have to hope their bio mothers will do the work on keeping them safe as unfortunately as I said, I have no legal rights. \n\nIn a sense I feel a massive relief.

She has an 8-year old daughter who is no longer allowed to see her grandparents and uncles. I am worried that she is being abused/manipulated and am unsure of how to proceed.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Some background:**\n\n\u201cJane\u201d (35/F) is my (35/F) best friend of 20 years. We met in kindergarten and over the years formed a sister-like bond. I was her maid-of-honor when she got married at 22, and she was mine when I got married five years ago. Our dads are close friends, our youngest brothers are best friends, and I am still friends with her brothers. She also has a male best friend from high school, who we will call Alf.\n\nShe has major issues with her Dad, who was a complete asshole to her mom. He had lots of affairs when we were growing up, eventually moving in with a woman down the street when we were in high school. Jane was very close with her mom and always sided with her. She has never forgiven her dad and hasn\u2019t wanted her daughter around him because he also had some drug issues. \n\nHe has since cleaned up his act, reconciled with his sons, and quit the hard drugs. He still smokes pot. I personally wouldn\u2019t have a problem with people smoking pot as long as they didn\u2019t do it around my kid, but I understand that some people are vehemently against it. So I always sort of sided with her on her Dad issues, though I did express that maybe she should see a therapist and work on forgiving him for the affairs and general assholery. If not for him, for her and her daughter\u2019s sake. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Her first marriage:**\n\nAwhile back, Jane got married to Rich. Though I wasn\u2019t wild about him, I was always friendly with him. He seemed like kind of a deadbeat and a bit moody, but certainly not dangerous. When she first got engaged to him, I expressed some concern that she was too young and should finish college first, but otherwise supported her decision. At one point before they got married, she thought he was cheating. I agreed and said she should get out now. She told Rich what I said, so though we were friendly afterward, it was always slightly tense.\n\nShe finished college, they had a daughter, things were looking good. A few years later things started to get rocky in their marriage and, from what I was told, he was sharing some sexy text messages with a female coworker. It seemed like Jane and Rich started working on things, but then a few years after that, she revealed to me that she had been having a series of retaliatory affairs. One of them was with a man we\u2019ll call Walt.\n\nThroughout all of this, I was never alerted to nor did I suspect any physically abusive behavior. I only knew about him withholding sex and possibly (probably) having an affair. I never came out and said, \u201cdump his sorry ass!\u201d because I figured that was a decision she needed to make on her own. Same with her brothers and friend Albert, all of whom she was really close with.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**The new boyfriend:**\n\nJane met Walt on a notorious hookup site. He was married at the time and with two kids. She was having the best time ever because she was finally getting what she needed sexually. She said he was such an amazing guy, a great dad, and that the only reason he was staying married was so that his bitchy wife didn\u2019t take the kids and move far away. All this was happening while Jane was still living with and married to Rich.\n\nShe didn\u2019t go into much more detail with me about Walt. I was also living on the opposite side of the country, so only saw her a few times a year. I was kind of leery about him but I figured the affair would blow over one way or another.\n\nThe first time I actually saw her after Walt came into the picture, we had drinks in my hometown. She spent the entire time texting with him. The whole time at dinner Walt was blowing up her phone, asking where she was, who she was with. She seemed annoyed and tense, but also super stoked to have this guy fawning all over her and giving her attention. I tried to gently steer her into recognizing that his behavior was not ok. She blamed herself, saying that she had broken his trust at one time and that\u2019s why he was so possessive. She said she didn\u2019t deserve him and that she was scared she would end up like her Dad, unable to commit. \n\nAt the time I didn\u2019t really recognize how horrible that was. This all happened while she was in the middle of her divorce, her job was stressing her out, and her daughter was having serious health issues. I saw it more as a symptom of the combined stress. This thing with Walt seemed like the only thing she was enjoying at all. I wish I had listened more to my Spidey senses and spoken up.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**The shit hits the fan:**\n\nA few months later, I got a phone call from her other close friend, Alf. We have always been friendly but never outside of our friendship with Jane. So the fact that he called me was kind of alarming.\n\nApparently, Jane had told Alf that they couldn\u2019t be friends anymore. Alf had made some sarcastic remark about Walt being older than Jane. Somehow Walt found out about this remark and was pissed. This man is in his 40\u2019s, by the way. \n\nSo Jane demanded that Alf apologize. Alf basically said he had nothing to apologize for. All he said was something along the lines of, \u201cSo, how\u2019s your old man?\u201d The whole thing was so stupid. Alf probably should have just apologized, but then again, he has always been a smart-ass. It\u2019s who he is, he hasn't changed. Jane has changed.\n\nHer outlook is that if her friends can\u2019t show respect to her boyfriend, she will remove them from her life.\n\nThe fact that Jane was willing to end her 20-year friendship with Alf over something so ridiculous, really freaked me out. I also found out in my conversation with Alf that she had left a lot out when she talked to me about Rich and Walt. There was some physical abuse with Rich, Walt had full access to her phone, and she was about to move in with Walt. Who was still married. \n\nShe was hiding all of this from me. Probably because she knew how I would feel about it.\n\nI lost it. Up until this point, I had tried to stay out of her business and let her figure her stuff out on her own. \n\nI should have called her, but I decided it would be better to write an email. I expressed concern for her and for her daughter; that she was moving from one abusive relationship right into another; and that I thought she should seek therapy to work on her self-esteem/dad issues for her own sake and her daughter\u2019s, before getting into a relationship. I also had some choice words to say about the boyfriend, that he sounds like a controlling, narcissistic man-child.\n\n(In hindsight, that was probably a little too direct and I should have handled things differently.)\n\nShe wrote back months later, telling me that unless I apologized for the hurtful things I said about WALT we couldn\u2019t be friends. She was (rightfully) mad that I didn\u2019t contact her before jumping to conclusions after speaking with Alf. However, I didn\u2019t believe that she was going to give me the full/accurate story after all that she had held back before.\n\nThat was a year and a half ago. I ran into her brother the other day and found out that she has cut off communication with her entire family, including her mother. They had a sit-down chat/intervention with her about all of this, and that was the end of that. Even at her grandmother\u2019s funeral, she didn\u2019t interact with her family. She has also deleted all of her social media accounts.\n\nShe has started going to church and while I don\u2019t think that is necessarily a bad thing, she *has* expressed that her brother is living in sin because he is gay. To contrast: one of the last times I saw her was at a gay bar, with her gay brother, having a gay old time.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**What can I do to help? Is it too late?**\n\nI am so worried for her and her daughter. I want to reach out to her again, gently this time, and just express that no matter what has happened, or how long it\u2019s been, or what has been said/left unsaid, if she ever, ever, ever needs me, I will be there for her. I\u2019d like to send a handwritten letter to the school where she teaches because I am pretty sure that her boyfriend monitors her phone. Maybe include some cartoons- when we passed notes in high school, I always drew cartoons to go with the notes.\n\nHer mom sent her an email a few months ago and Jane forwarded it to Walt while copying her mother. She simply said, \"Here is the email.\" Was that an accident or a cry for help? Thoughts? And thank you for reading my massive wall of text.", "subreddit": "emotionalabuse"}

If you've moved on so much then why are you still sat there taunting me from behind your fucking keyboard? \n\nI'm not obsessed with you, I just want you to fuck off, die, drop off the planet, whatever it takes. The only reason I'm still searching for you is because I feel unsafe, I might never feel safe again because you raped me.\n\nYou raped me that night when I came home and told you I cheated. I cheated because I was so unhappy that I wanted to leave but I felt trapped. I knew that by severing the ties we could never get back together again. Our relationship at that point was non existent. You were absent, I was absent, we never spent any time together. We were bad for each other. It was toxic. But you raped me, my therapist referred to it as rape but if you want to get technical it was sexual coercion. \n\nAll those other times however were rape, when I woke up to you touching me. When you'd tell me the next day about how you touched me in my sleep and I enjoyed it. I didn't enjoy it, I felt violated, molested. When you started fucking me in your sleep, it was rape. The act itself didn't make it rape because you couldn't help it, but the fact that you didn't do anything to prevent it, or try to get help for it is what made it rape. When you would wait until after I was drunk and half unconscious to try and have sex with me, that was rape. \n\nOur relationship started when I was 16 and you were 20, I was a fucking child. I already had a ton of past trauma, I was fucked up. You shouldn't have stayed with me, I didn't need a boyfriend I needed a parent. \n\nYes, I had an abortion when I was 19, yes it was your child. But I talked to you about it, we discussed it. Having it aborted was a lot more painful for me than it was for you both physically and mentally, but it was the right decision. Our relationship was so toxic, bringing a child into it would've been child abuse. Neither of us were suitable to be parents, only I had the balls to admit and go through with it. While you sat there quietly resenting me for a life that barely existed. The fact that you cared more about an EMBRYO than you did ME says it all. \n\nYes, I try to keep track of you online, so I can avoid you. I don't want to be anywhere near you ever again. It doesn't mean I'm secretly in love with you, I have PTSD. It's not like I can just forget because my mind is stuttering with the trauma of our relationship. You think I'm borderline but the way I behaved was because of you and your behaviour. You acted like a child and still do apparently.\n\nEither way, for once in your life it's time to put on your big boy pants. You're 31 years old, let go of me. I'm trying to work on my PTSD, I'm on a waiting list for EMDR therapy. Our relationship stunted my growth so I'm still as emotionally mature as a 16 year old. You are the adult, you always were. Take some responsibility and act your age. Stop goading me. I've deleted everything, my social media, I'm gone. This is my last post with this account.

I told myself that I wouldn't go back no matter when he said. \n\nI knew I would leave after I made that post but I wasnt ready for the chaos that would ensue. Coinsidently for the last month and 1/2 of our relationship this younger women (22) with face tattoos started working with him. He drove her everywhere and was with her far too often. She doesnt have a car and just got that job after completing a treatment center program. Whenever I asked why they were together so often or if he was fucking her I would get the usual \"you're crazy\" \"were just really close friends\" bullshit. Yeah, ok. I found myself not really angry about it and didnt question further. I was so checked out of this relationship I just didnt care and was recently promoted and transferred to a different job location so I had other things on my mind.\n\nWe booked a nice hotel on a day that we both had off from work. We had plans in the morning to get our cars serviced together and have lunch. We had great sex and cuddled like everything was normal. We went into his car to get his ciggarettes that night and her jacket was in the back seat. I threw it in the pool of the hotel and he jumped in after it and called me crazy. The next morning he got a phone call and ran out of the hotel room leaving me naked in the bed. He claimed a friend of his needed help assembling furniture and that he had to leave. I begged him to stay. He walked out so fast. I ate lunch alone. I got my car serviced alone.\n\nWhen I checked her social media for the first time the next few days she had posted beach photos from the day we were off together. His car was in the background. I didnt cry or get upset. I was so relieved I could leave now with out him having a reason to abuse me or tell me I was crazy. It was photographic evidence of his betrayal and he couldn't really gas light or twist it in a way that would disarm me. He Is her problem now. \n\nI just blocked him. I didnt say anything. Blocked everything. Social media, phone, email. He called me 30 times from random numbers. He texted me from other numbers that he was so sorry. That they are just friends. That I am the love of his life and he is dying with out me.\n\nAND MY FAVORITE LINE OF ALL:\n\n\"Something triggered you to flip out and act irrational, you're obviously going through something right now. I'll be here when your done acting crazy. The ball is in your court\"\n\nClassic narcissist.\n\nI am sad. Not that he cheated or that I'm alone. But that I could love a man in a mask for over two years so deeply and didnt even know it. I feel cheated for time. I feel lost, like my love allowed me to lose myself. I became so submissive and lost the ability to stand up for myself because I was afriad. I remember the apartment we had together when he was still wearing the mask and it was one of the most amazing times of my life. And it feel like it was a dream.\n\nI'm getting stronger now. I have unblocked him once to text him that I leaving him was one of the best decisions I made and that she will soon see the man behind the mask.\n\nThere is hope for this spicy meatball.\n\n*EDIT* there is nothing wrong with face tattoos.

I dated a psychopath for 4 plus years. And my life was a living hell. \n\nLittle back story on him. His father was abusive to his mother for 10+ years. He was a first date baby. He showed extreme signs of violence by the age 2. He would go around shooting bows and arrows at animals, his mother etc. When people cried, he said,\"he smiled.\"And did it more. \nAs a baby he had ticks. (which continued into his adult life) he would pick on clothes tags. \n\nHis parents divorced when he was 6. He was constantly fighting for his father's attention. And he gave him none. As he grew older,his parents got back together but he has learned how to be manipulative and violent. He'd make bombs inside his room and let them go off. Started drinking when he was 12. Smoking weed when 11.Majorly addicted to video games, smoking and sex. Every single day. \n\nHe started abusing girls around 5th grade. Even earlier. When he was in 4th grade he sexually assaulted his much younger cousin. She was probably 1. Then he would go to neighborhood pool and started fingering a girl there in 5th grade. She started crying and left. That's when his fascination for killing people also started. He would have elaborate plans. And how he wanted to carry it out. His grandfather took him to see a psychiatrist, and he diagnosed him with ASPD(Anti Social Personality Disorder), which is an early diagnose for Psychopath or Sociopath. \n\nHe had ODD as well. Got a felony for vandalizing people's property. The record was sealed. Juvenile. Then he started dating and sexually and physically assaulted his first gf. He would punch her in stomach. And forced her to have sex. She cried and cried and gave up. Because he started ignoring her. \n\nThen he started looking for preys. And got on Tinder. That also didn't go well. Women kicked him out. He was abusive and forced himself on them as well.\n\nI read his conversations where he was talking to a woman like she was an object. She never responded. He tried so hard for someone to have pity on him or give them dark stories. Or trap them somehow. \n\nThen he dated another woman. He was abusive to her. She just disappeared on him without telling. Moved states. He was still mad about her getting away from his control. \n\nHe would video call random women and somehow get them to get naked and secretly click their photos and had a huge album of it. He also recorded me and another ex secretly during sex. \n\nThen his ex was assaulted brutally. He would punch her and raped her for 3 weeks. And cut her open. And tied her to bed for days. She was assaulted again after he drugged her and cut her open again. She went to cops but no one believed her. She almost killed herself.\n\nThen it was my turn. I hadn't liked the guy. He was rude and always talked about himself. So I met him on date 3 to tell him, I don't want to see him anymore. He became very abusive in car. And was rude. I felt the feeling of doom. Then he goes get out of my car. And Noone has ever spoke to me like that. I started crying and told him he's an asshole. Then he apologized and kissed me. And said he's my bf. I told him, he's not. Won't take no for an answer. \n\nNext thing we know he's hogging all my time. Always hanging out at my place. Wanted my computer for video games. When that didn't work he always wanted me at his place. Making excuses how I live far. Or how his car doesn't work. He doesn't have money. Then I asked him why is he dating then? \n\nHe started lying to me to somehow get me to his place. Saying how he wants to spend all his time with me (which was because he wanted to monitor me at all times and he felt safest at his house because he had the house to himself most times,plus his abusive father condoned abuse).\n\nHe would follow me everywhere. Bathroom, shower, every single minute. When I started using bathroom alone. He freaked out and handpicked the lock. And started accusing me of being a cheater. \n\nThen came wrestling with me so he can gauze how strong I am physically. He made fun of me saying you aren't strong. I told him to mind his business. He punched the wall to intimidate me saying I'm cheating on him. And how he faked to cry and made me look like a bad person. So I apologized to him. \n\nOne day he took me to his house saying he needs to feed the cat. Then he said can't drop me, late for work. After work. I agreed. Then when he came home, I was ready to leave. He said can't let you go Cus he misses me. I said I don't want to stay. I can call a ride. He said he'll drop me tomorrow. So I agreed. And this went on for 8 days. He won't even go to work. Would keep raping me and fighting with me. Then going through my things. And laughing and playing video games saying how much I am having fun. I looked dead. And stuck. And had no hope for escaping. Then my family started calling me. He held phone to my face and said tell them you're safe. I said okay. But I told them get me out of here, he won't let me leave. He had hid my phone for a week. When I tried to run through garage. He chased me down and put me back in and locked all doors. He won't leave my side. My family started calling him and he blocked them all. So I told him, cops will be here soon. He got scared and went for his guns. And said he'll kill them all. I had to convince him he's safe and no need for guns. Just drop me off and all will be good. So he dropped me off. \n\nThen I blocked him and didn't wish to talk to him. He started stalking me and camping outside my house. Sending me videos. He didn't care about himself or me. He thought he was sneaky enough to get his way. And was above the law. He felt rules didn't apply to him and I was an object to be used. \n\nI really loved him or could be Stockholm's Syndrome. I felt sorry for his life. And how traumatic it was. I tried to be there for him. His father didn't want to do anything with him. He kicked him out and he slept in my parking lot for 10 days. I would give him food. My family didn't want anything to do with him. So I would sneak him in for showers and that was the first time he assaulted me. He slapped me for seeing flowers on my desk saying its from a guy. And when in told him to get out he said he would wake up everyone. I told him I don't care. Just leave. He wouldn't. So I had to make him go. \n\nThen came the apologies that he was jealous. It's my fault. He's just madly in love. That I can't be trusted. And this is while he talked to 3 women behind my back and when caught he felt justified and said its your fault for being unfaithful. So there was extreme physical violence towards me, I would cry that why did he do that to me. He just didn't care. My crying was also a bother to him. He had no sympathy for me what so ever. \n\nAfter that, physical assault was an everyday thing. If I would stand up for myself when he would put me down. He'd throw me into walls. Walk on my hands. Push me. And once tried to put covers over me to make me stop breathing. He had this cruelness to him. No shred of love. He was always angry. He expected me to handle his life while being abused. And if I didn't perform I would be put down and made to look bad. I had to always hide marks on my body with long sleeve clothes. My eyes lost hope. I stopped smiling. I didn't feel like myself. I felt insecure,violated,treated like an object. Didn't feel I was a human anymore. \n\nWhile I would make sure his life is okay. He would talk behind my back telling people I was a psycho and he's being abused. He would forward photos to female and guy friends to gain sympathy and wanted people to hate me. He would hit himself and take photos. People believed him. People would laugh with him when he slapped my butt in public, made jokes about putting a dog collar around my neck. No one ever held him accountable. Yet, they came to his defense after I started speaking up for myself and how he assaulted me. He still kept the act that he was the victim. I would get angry. I felt as if I was going crazy,why won't anyone believe me. What did I do to anyone? He never admitted that he's abused me so much. \n\nHe would tell me people think I am a bad person. It became so hard fighting back. I just lost all hope. I was exhausted. I had lost count of how many times I've been hit. Or how it happened. All I know was I was always in dangerous situations, running for my life on a road when I didn't even have money to call my family. He would keep my things. I recall,I ran on road for help while I was burning with fever. He would poke the area where I got a shot while I was crying. And would tell me no one would help me or believe me. I told him I don't need anyone to believe Cus I do and that doesn't change the truth. So he ripped my clothes and tried to rape me. I fought back. Then he went ahead and told people I am abusive. While I laid there exhausted. Crying and shocked. I froze. I froze and didn't care about what he was doing anymore. \n\nHe would pick on my body. He wanted to decide what my haircut should be. What my hair color should be. What clothes he likes on me. Which friends I should speak with. I always felt helpless, if I didn't comply he'd create a fight which could go South. \n\nThen I found out I was pregnant after the rape. When I told him. He denied that it's him. Yet he would refuse to wear a condom. Then he started punching my stomach so I have a miscarriage. I started crying. He goes I don't want to pay child support. You're a monster. I kept crying how could this guy be so cruel. That's when I decided I am getting an abortion. I would never have a child with him. He even assaulted me during self induced abortion. I had to get out of there while bleeding. And had to pretend to people that all is okay. I would cry at the kindness Uber drivers showed me. Anyone who showed kindness I felt do people still care?\n\nThen he assaulted me in public and someone called the cops. I didn't press charges. I was worried about his life. \n\nThen one day. He got mad at me for not playing the video game how he wanted. I stood up for myself and said I won't do it. He towered over me and said open your laptop. I will teach you. I said mind your own business and leave me alone. Next thing you know he jumped on me, started calling me a Bitch, Slut,  every damn thing in the world. I told him I am none of those things. He got even madder and just kept punching me. Had me pinned. I tried kicking him off. He just won't stop. So I bit his nose hoping he would get off me. He didn't. Lost it. And started punching my face,  all over. I tried to run. I don't know how he stopped. I tried to get my things and run. He had me in a choke holds then. Throwed me around like a rag doll. Hit my head into walls. And then final straw threw me on the ground,sat on me, started choking my neck while slapping me on my cheek. I went unconscious. I don't know what happened after that. All I know is, I saw him telling his roommate that I assaulted him. His nose. And that they should help him get rid of my body. Luckily I was on speaking terms with the guy. He asked him what did you do to her? \n\nI thought I was gonna die in that room that day. I stumbled and hid in closet and called 911. To find out he came in room and threatened me and said don't worry I called cops on you. I told him Ya so did I. He tried his level best to have me run away from there. I told him I am not going anywhere after what he did to me. He was worried. \n\nThen when cops came, he was charming. And quiet. Playing the victim and helpful party card. I was visibly shaken. I told the cops how it had happened. And that it's not the first time. Then they recalled I had called them before for wellness check on him.. I said yes,  I did. He had threatened to kill himself when I tried to breakup. \n\nThey arrested him. He was charged with felony. And 30 days in jail. He still bragged that it was my fault. Cops were wrong. And they just had to arrest a party.Which is not how the law works. \n\nThis guy has been ruining lives since his teenage years. Never getting caught. Just more violent. And I worry about him assaulting more women. I just wish people like him aren't born.", "subreddit": "survivorsofabuse"}

Sorry if I am doing stuff wrong. This may be painfully long.\nMy (now ex) boyfriend and I got together a little over 3 years ago. In this I will call him S. When we got together I was almost one year sober. He was still a practicing alcoholic. Very early on, S showed signs of a total lack of regard for my feelings. But he\u201cloved me SO deeply\u201d very quickly. He seemed to find me more sexually desirable than anyone ever had before. He made me feel so wanted. He was so strange and special and, I thought at the time, so misunderstood. His drinking became a problem very quickly. One particularly hurtful and frustrating night while we were on a vacation, he left me naked in bed saying he was getting us pizza, only for me to find him in a bar 2 hours later, worried sick because he wouldn\u2019t answer my calls or respond to my texts. I relapsed that night. And we had our first physical fight. I black out very easily (one of the main reasons I quit drinking) and he told me the next day that I had attacked him, totally unprovoked. But he forgave me. And because I couldn\u2019t remember, I just felt so ashamed and so grateful that he still loved me. \nI quit drinking again, and he didn\u2019t. Months pass, and on Christmas he ghosted me even though we had plans. I waited for him at his house. I started drinking again that night and we had our worst physical fight. I broke a bottle over his head and it cut him badly. He bled a lot. My whole head and face was bruised and swollen. He insisted that he never hit me, but I had a black eye, half of my head was swollen inches bigger than it\u2019s normal size and bruises covering my entire body. He told me I punched myself in the face because I felt so guilty for hurting him. Once again, I was so ashamed of myself, it was the worst thing I had ever done. None of my previous relationships had been violent. I believed him again that I had just lost it and attacked him for no reason. I broke up with him, knowing that no matter who was instigating this violence, we were obviously very bad for each other. He sent me pictures of the cut on his head, saying how fucked up it was that I would attack him and then leave him because I couldn\u2019t face my own guilt. I only showed my face to my one best friend who I was living with at the time. She insisted that as a strong 6ft2 man, even if I (a 5ft7, 130 lb woman)were randomly attacking him, he should be able to hold me down or subdue me without punching me in the face. She was convinced that he was lying about how our physical fights would start, and she told me I was just defending him and putting all of the blame on myself because he had abused and gaslighted me. I still don\u2019t know what happened, but I do think there was more to it than what he told me. \nWe were apart for almost 6 months after that. I was sober from that day on, but I missed him so badly and I only got more sad as time went on. I had to get a new phone number to keep him from contacting me, he started sending drunk incoherent messages to my friends. One message he sent to my best friend said \u201ctell her (meaning me) that even though she smells like raw chicken I love her. I\u2019m only half a person without her..\u201d\nAfter months of telling him to leave me alone I agreed to see him and talk to him. When I saw him he looked ill and was obviously half hungover and half drunk. I told him I would be with him again if he quit drinking. And he did. \nHe was sober for almost a whole year. For the first 8 months, he was only exhibiting all of the qualities I loved about him. I was so impressed and surprised by his ability to abruptly quit drinking. He was sweet, helpful and reliable. He didn\u2019t make fun of me as much, he seemed to care if I was having a hard time, he texted or called me every day. I started to trust him in a way I never had before. Then very suddenly he reverted back to some of his old ways. He only wanted to see me once a week, he would criticize my job, my car, my hair, he would very frequently remind me that my worries about what was going on in our relationship had nothing to do with him, I was just \u201ckind of an anxious mess\u201d. He would bring up my ex boyfriends from the past, berate me for being a \u201cserial monogamist\u201d (a term I taught him). I regretted ever having confided in him about my mistakes and short comings, because he used every weakness I ever told him about against me. One day I asked him what was going on, why things had changed so quickly and so drastically. He got very mad about this and wouldn\u2019t speak to me for a week. It felt just like the \u201cgood old days\u201d when he would completely shut me out if I said anything he didn\u2019t like. \nAfter smelling alcohol on his breath and noticing him being uncharacteristically affectionate and forgetful, I asked him if he was drinking again. He insisted he wasn\u2019t. Over the span of 4 months, I began to suspect more and more that he was drinking and lying to me about it. I told him that if he was drinking again, I thought we could work through that together but if he started drinking and lied about it, it might have a powerful negative affect on our relationship. He promised that he would tell me if he started drinking again. \nEventually I pulled the information out of him, he was drinking again and had been for a couple months. I left him again when he got mad at me for saying that I was sad that he\u2019d lied to me. This time while we were apart I became very depressed. I have a history of depression, and this was one of my lowest lows. I cried every day for 4 months. I quit working, and became so lonely and isolated. I thought about suicide often and really lost all grip on my mental health. Again he refused to leave me alone, always finding a new way to contact me. After I had blocked him on every avenue he started sending me letters and sending strange messages to my friends again. Once again, I caved into my loneliness and agreed to see him. I didn\u2019t want to die anymore now that there was someone who \u201ccared about me\u201d and wanted to spend time with me. I only told one of my friends that I had been seeing S again, because I knew that everyone in my life would think I was insane for having any contact with S at all. Just two days ago I told my mom that I was considering get back together with him and she basically told me that she is worried about me and that I needed to start seeing a therapist and that there is something very wrong with me if I think I deserve to be treated the way S treats me. I went to see him tonight and we had a conversation about the fact that once again he is drinking every day(even though he said he wouldn\u2019t if I got back together with him). I broke up with him again. \nI have never loved or wanted anyone more. And at the same time, I have never been so hurt by anyone before. I feel crazy a lot of the time when S and I fight because we never see situations the same way as each other and I don\u2019t know what is real anymore. I felt so relieved to have him back, but I agree that there is something very wrong with me to have even considered being with him again. He has not been a good partner to me. He has destroyed my self worth. I feel like I only matter if I matter to him. My friends and family were all so glad when they thought I was finally done with him. Now I feel like I am starting the whole breakup all over again. I don\u2019t think I can handle any more of this. I am only happy if he is happy with me. How can I learn to be okay without him? What do I do with myself? Will I ever be happy without him? How do I convince myself to fall out of love with this person who hurts me so much?", "subreddit": "NarcissisticAbuse"}

The whole thing is so bizarre and unhealthy.\n\nThis is the girl who paid for him and continues to do so (he's chronically unemployed), babies him, takes care of him, all but wipes his ass for him.\n\nThis is the girl I've seen him snap at, be emotionally abusive towards, belittle, talk down to, and talk shit about behind her back.\n\nThis girl is no longer me.\n\nSo I'm truly crushed. The last few days have been some of the hardest of my entire life. I know she's always resented me because I was there first and he loved me first and she wanted him...but little does she know, this will end in her devastation.\n\nBut I'm free. He's her problem now.

My Narc ex certainly doesn\u2019t seem to.  I left him during my first trimester.  We both wanted a child (or at least he CLAIMED to want to have children with me), and we tried for this baby.  But when I told him the happy news I was pregnant, he suddenly did a 180 on me and reacted horribly.  He suddenly claimed he didn\u2019t want to have a baby with me, and he treated me horribly during my pregnancy.  I had 24/7 morning sickness and he would constantly scold and mock me for being sick, telling me I was \u201cbeing a big whiny baby\u201d, that the nausea \u201cwas all in my head\u201d, and that I was \u201cthe only pregnant woman he ever knew who was sick all the time\u201d.  Seeing as that he had three other baby mamas before me, I highly doubt he had never seen a sick pregnant woman before.  He would yell at me whenever he caught me lying on the couch or in bed being sick because I wasn\u2019t able to cook or clean or do anything around the house.  Anytime I had ANY issues or bad symptoms during my pregnancy, he would scoff at me and accuse me of whining and being a \u201cbig baby\u201d.  He refused come with me to any of my prenatal appointments, and he even refused to look at the baby\u2019s first ultrasound photos.   I left him when he began physically abusing me while I was pregnant.  He punched me in the face and sprayed bleach from a bottle right into my face.\n\nEver since I left him, he has completely ignored this baby\u2019s existence.  He has never asked how the baby is doing, he has never asked me if the baby needs anything or ever bought one single baby item for him, he does not know the baby\u2019s due date, and he does not know the baby\u2019s name.  He only knows it\u2019s going to be a boy because one of his relatives told him.  I have chosen a name for our son, and I have asked him numerous times if he would like to know his son\u2019s name.  He refuses to ask me what our son\u2019s name is, and I refuse to tell him unless he indicates he wants to know.  He refuses to express any interest whatsoever in wanting to know what our son\u2019s name is, so I\u2019ve never told him and he does not know.  Whenever I get on him about not caring or being involved with this baby, he calls me \u201ccrazy\u201d, \u201cbipolar\u201d, and tells me \u201cThe kid isn\u2019t even here yet, so shut the fuck up.\u201d  It\u2019s as if the baby doesn\u2019t exist to him just because it\u2019s still in my belly.\n\nThe baby is due in just a couple of weeks.  My ex will NOT be allowed to come to the hospital and be there for his birth.  After the way he has treated me and proverbially spit in our son\u2019s face since the day he was conceived, he doesn\u2019t deserve to see his son be born.  I won\u2019t be putting his name on the birth certificate as the baby\u2019s father or giving my son his last name, either.  As far as I\u2019m concerned, my son does not have a father, just a sperm donor.  I have heard from one of his other baby mamas that he was hateful, inconsiderate, and uninterested during her pregnancies as well.  So this is obviously a pattern with him.  He takes no responsibility whatsoever to prevent pregnancies from occurring, yet he gets pissy when they do occur.\n\nAnyone else have any bad experiences with being pregnant by a Narcissist?

I wanted him in my life. He loved me. We needed each other. Our connection was unique. The true story however was slowly being exposed. How he groomed me as a child online. How he used me lying about my age at first as a way to guilt me into doing whatever he wanted. The way he came and went out of my life with such ease, demanding full attention at his convenience when he was here but becoming uninterested when he realized I wouldn\u2019t meet and hook up. He was a predator. He was not my friend. He was a predator. I was 14 and he was 20. For 4yrs he was talking to me in a way that if my own child was being talked to by a 20-24yr old I would call the police. It\u2019s funny how when you\u2019re 14 you think you\u2019re grown. But being a mom to a now 14yr old I realize how innocent I was. I was a baby. A baby. He should have known better. He was never my friend. He was a predator. Saying it hurts. I\u2019m not sure how this happened. Realizing you were a victim is so fucking harsh. I thought he loved me and needed me. At the same time I had a healthy fear of meeting him and never complied. This attachment to my \u201cfriend\u201d shaped so much of my life. That\u2019s so hard to face. It\u2019s so hard to take in. How did one person have such a big influence on me? Why did I let him come back over and over? The delusion is shattering now you guys and it\u2019s fucking brutal. The way he purposely triangulated me with his wife. The way he humiliated me and made me feel like a stalker. I had so much shame. It\u2019s not so different from the shame that comes from being sexually abused as a child. Coming to terms with the fact that the person you love was your abuser. Realizing they hurt you. Realizing they\u2019re dark and not who you thought. My heart is breaking. I\u2019m going thru so many emotions. Grief of this friend I thought I knew dying. He was never real and is literally dead to me now. Sadness for that 14yr old girl who tried to please him for 18yrs.

I hope at some point to not feel the need to continue posting but that day has not yet arrived. \n\nI\u2019m not well, haven\u2019t been for 6 months or so and it\u2019s only getting worse not better. Severe clinical depression diagnosis in Jan. And I\u2019m now having several anxiety/panic attacks a day. My health is in the mf\u2019n garbage. If I get dressed twice a week I call that a success but leaving the house is another obstacle left only for my therapy appointments usually. So there\u2019s that. \n\nMarried 18 years to my narc, he\u2019s had multiple affairs with sex workers, dday was 5 years ago. There\u2019s a lot more but it\u2019s unnecessary info at this point.  He\u2019s been so uncaring and unsupportive during my current breakdown, any struggle I\u2019ve been through big or small. The affairs, rug swept, \u201cthat was in the past and I\u2019m not living in the past like you are \u201c it doesn\u2019t matter that I contracted std\u2019s, that it has a life long impact on my health and sex life, it\u2019s in the past. \n\nAt some point he granted me full access to his devices and credit card accounts. Except his phone is a work phone and I don\u2019t have access to his work computer. I\u2019m not an idiot, I know what a delete button is and that if you want to hide something you\u2019ll hide it. I check his phone every now and then, rarely find anything of interest aside from disgusting sexist jokes with his guy friends I won\u2019t repeat here. Until last night when I forced myself to go to a friends retirement party with narc and his (who I\u2019ve decided is new supply) new bff was there. Bff starts saying things to me in this weird condescending tone like \u2018I\u2019m so glad you came, it\u2019s good to see you got out of the house, it\u2019s really nice to see you out, how are you doing really,\u2019 I felt a panic attack coming, disassociation...f*?! It was unsettling. Like he\u2019s been fed all kinds of information, not the kind of stuff you\u2019d say to your friends in a caring way about your spouse. It felt manipulative and coordinated.  I say new supply because there\u2019s so much stuff narc would normally tell me but he\u2019s not. He loves to talk more than almost anything in the world and he\u2019s not talking to me because he\u2019s telling all the details of his day, life to his new bff. I used to be his bff but not anymore. Anyway, after we sat down I noticed he was reading an email from bff. So this morning I checked his phone, there is no email it\u2019s been deleted and deleted from the deleted folder. That\u2019s not sketchy. But while I\u2019m looking I see he\u2019s been telling our oldest son (my step-son) about my moods and how he\u2019s not bring granddaughter here because things aren\u2019t good at the house. Now I agree I\u2019m not ok, but my not ok is overwhelming sadness most of the time, not a raging temper or anger.  I generally go to the bedroom if I\u2019m getting overwhelmed I don\u2019t subject everyone to my crying or whatever I\u2019m feeling.  He\u2019s making me out to be some lunatic to our kids!  I saw an email to kid 3 ( we have 6, his 3, my 3, like the Brady bunch &amp; one grandchild) a few weeks ago that said something similar. Also a deleted email string to the oldest asking him if he still had an extra bed and frame. We don\u2019t need a bed for anything. We have a 3 bedroom house and they all have decent beds.  Phrases like \u201cI think might need that bed\u201d.  I\u2019m both sick I even looked at his phone and not because I\u2019m so tired of living in the dark just sitting around waiting for something to happen to me. \n\nI don\u2019t know what to do to get better so I can help myself get out of here. I\u2019ve wanted to tell him to leave so so many times but I am so scared that I can\u2019t take care of myself. He\u2019s not even taking care of me but he\u2019s paying the bills, basically keeping the lights on, nothing more.  I can\u2019t work like this and I need to work to get out of here. It\u2019s like the chicken and the egg.

It feels like he\u2019s exhaling  a nerve agent while whispering I love you in my ear. So much cognitive dissonance I don\u2019t know what is real anymore.  I honestly don\u2019t know what to do.

Any advice for trying to salvage the friendship?\n\nIt\u2019s an incredibly long and complicated story but the short form is I was with someone for a year and a half. We were polyamorous and he was another partner of mine while I was engaged. My engagement dissolved dramatically and he became my primary. He started seeing another girl and I had a huge depression spiral due to the trauma of losing my family so suddenly and multiple other abuses, socially and sexually. They got closer and closer which I was actually fine with but he started giving her the lion\u2019s share of the emotional labor. I thought I was handling it pretty well but whenever I would try to address the situation with him he would often have these panic attack level type freak-outs and tell me he never wanted the relationship and I was always in the wrong for whatever it was I was trying to address, no matter how calmly. I don\u2019t respond well to anger and his grew and grew until it became abusive and I couldn\u2019t even be myself around him. He would always apologize after he calmed down and tell me things that were completely opposite of the things he said when he was angry. I stuck around and kept trying to work on it because I genuinely love him and want to see him succeed but the environment became increasingly toxic and he cared for my feelings less and less and I felt more and more emotionally abandoned until I gave up. We tried to reconcile a few times and he initiated some sexual interactions, which I had mixed feelings about because we weren\u2019t really hanging out or having a regular friendship at the time and it made me feel used. The last time he got super wasted and tried to leave immediately after we fooled around saying that he had to take his gf to school in the morning. When I told him to crash and leave early in the morning and refused to give him his keys he got more and more upset and starting tossing stuff around my room so I threw his keys at him and told him to get the fuck out of my house. We\u2019ve still tried to reconcile, I think due to our vast physical and creative chemistry. I truly care for him but now he\u2019s telling me he never wanted to relationship, all his anger and the way he treated me was completely justified, that I constantly lied or tried to manipulate him, that he cares for me but doesn\u2019t want to have a physical relationship (even tho he\u2019s been the one initiating it lately) I feel like nothing I say is right and in a textbook gaslighting sense I don\u2019t even trust my own thoughts and feelings now.

I\u2019ve been told by friends and professionals just to walk away but I don\u2019t want to. I don\u2019t want to give up on someone I genuinely care about even if they\u2019re being emotionally abusive because I know deep down their intentions are good and if they could just become a little more self-aware they could hold themselves accountable and grow.

Everyone else gets acknowledged. He NEVER EVER can just own a mistake and will spend hours fighting me and evading having to even acknowledge validity of my feeling l share. During major low in our marriage and at time my health fell apart and l was diagnosed with mystery illness (Major Fibromyalgia or Lyme still not sure), our sex life became major issue and l refused to have sex with him because over and over he\u2019d turn on the charm, tell me what l wanted to hear, even buy flowers, then we\u2019d have sex and boom he\u2019d drop me like yesterday\u2019s news....back to being invisible. He admitted to me that in my sleep he touched me 2x since he knew ld not consent awake. I was medicated on sleep prescription due to health related insomnia and knocked out. Took him 1 yr to admit it. When l became angry he said \u201cIt was no big deal, it was only 2X in top of clothes, for minutes\u201d \nRecently l have hit my limit and see he ignores our kids letting them play video games up to 16hrs a day when l am sick in bed and can\u2019t get up. He doesn\u2019t bathe them for up to a week. This has gone on whole 4yrs l have been sick. Doesn\u2019t even make younger two change clothes. Mind you l can often barely get out of bed to brush my own teeth. I pull my self up to put kids back together and then go back down. \nI mentioned divorce last few weeks and that ld hit my limit and of course he has been \u201cMr New Man\u201d he claims antidepressants he went in 3months ago has caused him to become whole new person.\nThing is l have asked him to sleep in separate room for past 3months and yet he stalks me. Bangs on door at 3am (hears a noise and has to investigate whole room and SEE WHAT I AM DOING) Yells at me for it taking too many knocks on locked door before l get to it and open it, once l was in tub and he used credit card to slip lock.\nGrand finale was other day when my 14yr old slipped and admitted he has been telling her things such as \u201cl am worried about your Mom she\u2019s different, doing drugs or something IDK. Just promise me you won\u2019t tell your mom l\nTold you because it will stress her out which will make her sicker and you know we don\u2019t want to make her sick!\u201d Mother Fucker!!  Admittedly medical Marijuana is legal in my state and l use for pain over having to take Vicodin Percocet etc. don\u2019t think my kid needed to know that!\nTold him l was DONE and to leave. He begged me and asked we get together with therapist. I reluctantly agreed. Therapist said to heal marriage and protect kids God can not work unless we are under same roof. The day l decided to say LEAVE! I felt a sense of freedom and weight lifted l can\u2019t describe...like suddenly l can function and deal with life and get back to my kids who are neglected. When therapist strongly suggested we stay under same roof l reluctantly agreed to try it because of kids and not wanting to put them through separation. I went right back to not functioning, constant panic attacks, fatigue that is indescribable, and feel so mentally CONFUSED AND DISORIENTED. Like l can\u2019t even handle a load of laundry. I have always been neat freak and disciplined, now my house looks like episode of \u201cHoarders.\u201d He says he committed to change and apologized for first time in marriage with little coaxing. Mind you the feeding my daughter  mental poison and stalking me has been as recent as last week.HELP!!!!!!! Any chance he\u2019ll change!?!! I don\u2019t even love him and actually am nauseated by his presence! I want to spare kids of divorce and never saw my life needing up like this. \ud83d\ude1e", "subreddit": "NarcissisticAbuse"}

Has anyone else realised that they only started comparing themselves because of how they were treated?", "author": "Vixmpixel", "self_text": "This dawned on me today. Before I met my nex, my confidence wasn't great, but I never felt the need to compare myself to anyone else. I didn't care if others were doing better or had more than me. \n\nWhen with my nex and his dysfunctional family, I found myself feeling in competition for approval. Not only from my nex, but from his family. I found myself comparing myself to his brother's girlfriends, because his brother was the golden child, and these girlfriends were being treated better than me. They were better than me, doing more, looked more attractive. My nex' sister hated me from the beginning yet I never found out why. But she liked all the other brothers' girlfriends. His narc mother would like me one day and then the next make digs about me to her son. But they put their masks up when around golden child brother's girlfriend. So naturally I avoided said girlfriend as I felt inferior and envious that she was being treated better.\n\nFast forward, I left my nex nearly 2 years ago. In that time, I've realised that whenever any family or friends are doing well, better, got a promotion, earning more than me, doing better in their relationship, progressing, buying a house etc, I instantly get a pang of jealousy, anxiety, a feeling of inadequacy, like I'm failing. I instantly begin comparing myself to them all.\n\nI really hate feeling this way. I never let it be known, I always am happy for them and let them know that, but underneath it all I take an emotional hit.

I then realized if I did, she would of course spin it around and get an ego stroke and say \u201csee? He\u2019s so crazy! Why is he reaching out to you? I told you he\u2019s crazy!\u201d \n\nWould it be crazy if I told you that I can see your future? That I know what\u2019s in store for you and what you can expect? That she is using you? Like a human tool, to get a rise out of me? To get a rise out of you? \n \nWhat\u2019s crazy, what\u2019s *really* crazy is that you were my friend. You were her friend for years. I grew to care for you, I trusted you because I saw you as her friend, and eventually as my friend. But that didn\u2019t stop you for making advances on her. That didn\u2019t stop you when you ended your long-term relationship to be with her. That didn\u2019t stop you when you knew she broke up with me to hook up with you. It didn\u2019t stop you from betraying me and your best friend. \n \nAnd then what happened? After only a month? She left you. Because you weren\u2019t bowing down to her every command. And what did she do? Cry her crocodile tears to me to take her back. And I *stupidly* did. Mostly out of spite, to hurt you, (I\u2019m so sorry) because of what you did, and the other % because I was so trauma bonded to this person that having her back in my life felt like winning the lottery. At that point in my life I had no idea what a covert Narc even was, what hoovering was , any of this (thank you reddit).\n\nI spent years in misery. I sure as hell looked happy on all my posts didn\u2019t I? I looked like i was in the perfect relationship didn\u2019t I? I really sold it well. The fancy vacations, the sentimental gifts on my birthday, the love letters and admiration on social media. Just like you do. Right now. I know you both didn\u2019t block me because you wanted me to see. You want me to go and see how happy you both are, how in love you are. How stupid and miserable I would feel. You wanted me to be hurt by it. It worked, for a time, but now? It makes me sad. Not sad because i wish that was me instead of you, but because i know what you must be going through, through the fake happy posts.\n \nWould it be crazy to tell you i would cry myself to sleep next to her? From all the anxiety of walking on egg shells? Would it be crazy to tell you how I thought so little of myself that when she degraded me I thought I deserved it? And when she eventually left me for you, *again* how I almost killed myself? How I was in thousands of dollars in debt because of her? How I had gained so much weight from stress and shitty eating habits from her? How my hair was *literally* falling out in *clumps* from how stressed I was? I had so many *gut* feelings, my stomach would actually feel like it\u2019s on fire and my mind would SCREAM at me, but I would push it down so hard because \u201cI loved her\u201d. \n\nI can see your future, my dear recycled supply. And I pity you so much. I pity you because I know what you\u2019re thinking right now. I know how you feel right now. She\u2019s the woman of your dreams, it *must* be fate, you are her soulmate, it was simply meant to be. How she\u2019s so romantic, cooking you dinner, brining you flowers, showering you with gifts and attention. How she\u2019s the perfect partner, she\u2019s incredibly gorgeous and you are so lucky to have her. People make mistakes, right? And she\u2019s not perfect but you love her anyway. \n\nI pity you because I know the pain that is coming, i didn\u2019t run away from it like you did, I have lived it. You see, right now, you will experience the most profound fairytale love you have ever experienced. It will be magical, it will feel right. But the day will come where you will taste the ashes in your mouth from the world you know that she will set aflame. The worst part is? There is absolutely nothing you can do about it. You can be the absolute perfect supply, the most obedient, have the most money, have the best body, never raise a word to contradict her, and she will still hate you and leave you. You see, narcs like to play a game. A game that both you and I lost. She wanted to see how powerful she is, how smooth and manipulative she can be, and she is. She was able to get both you and I back, and even got us to hate each other. \n\nBut I don\u2019t hate you (anymore). I feel sorry for you. I feel sorry for you because you need so much help, you think she is your savior, when she is the antichrist. You are codependent, you are anxious and you depend on her bread crumbs of \u201clove\u201d to feed your insecurities. She picked such a good supply, you\u2019re family doesn\u2019t live by you and you betrayed your friends when you got with her, you\u2019re isolated, you\u2019re needy, and you crave her. You\u2019re perfect (for now)\n\nI  pray for you, truly, I do. I pray that one day, when you find out she\u2019s been cheating on you, when you get an STD, when your hair falls out, when you\u2019re in debt, when you cut ties with your family and friends, when you have no where else to go because she financially trapped you, when you gain weight and she ridicules you for it, when you cry yourself to sleep, when you want to kill your self, I hope you reach out. Just like his previous supply did (we are now bff\u2019s btw, he\u2019s a great person and angers me that you betrayed him too, but that\u2019s between you two). I hope that you see the light. I hope that when the truth is staring at you in your face, when your gut burns and your mind screams that you will listen. I hope you listen and leave,  not obey and stay. I know that you are codependent and don\u2019t want to be alone, but being alone doesn\u2019t mean you have to be lonely, you can fall in love with yourself. You can learn to count on yourself, instead of others, you can grow stronger, better and smarter. \n\nI know that karma is real. I know she never looses and address. I hope that when you get yours, you really feel the pain, as I have, and learn from it. Good luck to you. \n\n\u2764\ufe0f", "subreddit": "NarcissisticAbuse"}

Specifically, I\u2019ve been thinking about how he decided one day that I was \u201cboring in bed\u201d he called me \u201cvanilla\u201d and a \u201cpillow princess\u201d. This was all out of the blue and it hurt me really deeply. I remember after that I felt like sex was a show. I would try hard to not be boring. He would cheat on me. I thought he didn\u2019t like sex with me because he preferred it with all these other women- I felt not good enough. He would even withhold sex from me because he said he didn\u2019t really enjoy it with me because of how boring I was.\n\nI keep wondering about the future. If I\u2019ll ever be able to have sex with someone again without feeling that twinge of anxiety. Even now just thinking about him saying that makes me cry. I felt like it was my fault he was cheating or that I truly would never please anyone because of how I am. I recognize that in a relationship partners may have different needs and you can compromise accordingly, but he never said anything about this to me until one day he just blew up and said all that. I felt so embarrassed and ashamed. Like I was the most unattractive girl in the world.", "subreddit": "NarcissisticAbuse"}

I kept bringing up Tinder and the fact that he wasted two years of my life after we broke up and that I was mad at myself for allowing it. He essentially called me crazy.

{"post_id": "bhtqdn", "created_utc": 1556326381, "title": "Is this abuse if so please give me some advice", "author": "Wha423", "self_text": "So I live with my mom who divorced my dad about two years ago. Since living alone with her I've started to pick up on quite a few things. My dad who is a little lazy usually likes it when I help him with things. I usually don't mind doing this because he is always appreciative of my help and makes me feel like I'm loved. My dad is a very kind man and I love being around him. However, on the other hand my mother always demands that I do things and whenever I do I am never offered help and seldom thanked for my help. Most of the things I'm told to do I am yelled at from across the house and expected to do immediately if I takes more than five minutes for me to get to it I am often yelled at again to go do it, nothing explicitly abusive just a not so subtle reminder that, \"I asked to do something.\" Most of the things that I am told that I should do are small but what annoys me about this particular instance is that in the amount of time my mom takes to tell me to do these things she very easily could do them herself, the most common one I can think of is walking the dogs (which I do on a regular basis anyway, but only neglect to do if I am doing something and someone else is downstairs aka her). This is just a little something that has been wearing down on me since the divorce. I definitely appreciate my dad a lot more because I now know one of the things he had to deal with (he also took care of both the dogs at all times). Another thing that has annoyed me to no end is the difference in the way I am treated in comparison to my sister who is three years older than me and in college. She has always had a hard time doing anything that resembled work around the house. If asked to do something like vacuum the house it might take her up to two weeks to do it, whereas the longest it take me to get to this has been two days. She is never held accountable for cleaning up after herself by my mom something I have complained about countless times to her but she never says a thing to my sister to get this to change. My sister started dating this one guy who my mom adores and they are basically given free roam of wherever they want whereas me and my girlfriend are not allowed in a room with the door closed and my mom constantly waits in the next room listening in on us. As kids I was bullied a lot in school (all levels) and at home by my sister, who my mom never \"punished\" in front of me because she thought I might think that she had favorites (her words) so instead I never even knew if my sister had been punished for things like slamming my hand in a door or trying to poke out my eyes or verbal abuse. In fact I hardly ever even knew when she was in trouble let alone what it was for. Additionally my sister's tuition is about 3 times mine (my mom started complaining about money as soon as I started looking at colleges) for reference my mom said she will pay for 4 years of undergrad for both of us (she makes a fucking ton of money). Also she continuously encourages my sister living an extravagant lifestyle, my sister was given a second master bedroom in the house and two walk in closets and a walk in bathroom. I lived in a room less than half the size of hers until after the divorce which I was allowed to move into another room that we didn't use anymore presumably because she wants to keep up the appearances of being a good mother to anyone who visits the house. Anyway the real problem I have with all of this is that when my sister started dating her current boyfriend she was only about 1 year older than I am right now and yet she was treated vastly differently. I know that differences can be chalked up to different people but even before my parents were divorced I was the responsible one, doing more around the house getting into trouble less and working harder at school. So the real problem I have here is that my sister is still allowed to be lazy and gets more money spent on her while I am treated like the one who isn't well behaved and lazy and gets next to nothing in comparison (note this only applies to my mom, my dad treats us both very fairly and equally). Additionally I recently started to notice multiple forms of manipulation my mom participates in with me in particular. One of my dogs died a few years ago, she had a growth in her stomach that ruptured and cause internal bleeding. So we took her to the vet as soon as possible (just me and my mom) and when we got there they said we can save her, or you can euthanize her. My mom then told me about how our old dog (she was ten at the time, black lab) probably wouldn't live much longer even if we had the surgery and about the price (this was all done rather subtly through her use of an anecdote of her friend who fosters dogs) and basically made it seem like the worst option (or at least like she would spend a ridiculous amount of money on something that might not prolong our dogs life much longer) and then told me it was my choice (I was 14 or 15) so I \"chose\" to have my dog euthanized and then I sat there and watched my best friend of the past ten years die all while she told me how they had to put her dog down when she was younger and how she couldn't bring herself to be with it when they killed it. (Also she complained to me about the price of the euthanization the next week). So basically I was a fucking mess after this and spent the next week crying basically nonstop because I felt so guilty because I had killed my best friend. She took off a week of work and let me take off one day of school. The next week she tried to talk me into getting a new dog. So basically this is the reason I spent the next two years depressed and even seriously considered suicide twice. Also when I got my permit for driving one day I didn't want to go out for lunch and she was in the car with me so I said, \"Im going to go home for lunch\" and she said she no your going to this restaurant with me, but I was driving so I went home. She started \"crying\" (Ive become extremely skeptical of her crying at anytime after this event) for reference I had only ever seen her cry before when my dog died and both times it seemed fake. And basically tried to guilt trip me into going to lunch with her and trying to make me feel bad basically because I was fucking depressed and extremely apathetic and didn't ever want to leave the house. So the next week I was talking to my sister and she told me that my mom said \"Oh, yeah I definitely overreacted a bit there.\" about that particular event. She not once spoke about it to me or apologized to me about her overreaction. Also every time I drove with her after that she found something to criticize about my driving and yelled at me to start breaking when I was basically at a full stop already (I also find this in particular to be extremely hypocritical because she pulls up less than a foot behind the car in front of her when she drives). She has also repeatedly throughout my childhood called me out for things I've done wrong in public spaces (always a few weeks or months and a few time even years after it) these are always things that I have expressed that I was deeply disappointed in myself or that I heavily criticized myself for having done and yet she felt the need to call public attention to them in front of strangers despite knowing that I was one incredibly shy and ashamed of all these things. More recently though she has started saying that I can be an asshole to her when I want to be. This is always when I am in a depressive mood (I am no longer chronically depressed but I still get depressive for a few days every month or so) and don't want to be around anyone and to be left alone or in response to her doing one of the aforementioned things or just generally treating me like shit so yeah sometimes I want her to leave me alone and not talk to her but in her mind its always because Im an \"asshole\" and could not possibly be in response to her in anyway. She even straight up told my girlfriend that I can be an asshole at dinner one night (for reference my girlfriend is my best friend and one of the few people who I feel comfortable around and the only person who I trust enough to tell basically anything personal about myself, I'm a very private person). All of this has led me to think that my mom is narcissistic or at least has a lot of the traits that would define a person as such. I would like the opinions of others on this and some advice on if this is a salvageable relationship, if it might get better once I leave for college, or if I should just take her offer of college tuition and gtfo. I am about to leave for college, I've committed and will be going there in a few months so I feel like I've put up with her this long I can probably stay and get some free tuition out of this toxic relationship.", "subreddit": "abuse"}

{"post_id": "bhwj2r", "created_utc": 1556348171, "title": "My Narc Roommate Uses Anger as a Weapon", "author": "MC91909", "self_text": "I hope I'm posting in the right community. This story is long and I'm on mobile. Apologies.\n\n\nTL;DR There have been 3 instances where narc has picked a fight to use anger as a weapon to scare me. I'm at my wit's end because it's a pattern. Other roommate doesn't want to be involved even though she's the only one with authority. \n\n\nI live with my best friend, let's call her Jane. Jane is currently the only one on the lease in our three bedroom apartment. The narc in question we'll call Max, because she goes from zero to sixty over the most trivial things. \n\n\nI was homeless for 6 months and desperate for a place to live. Jane told me her shitty roommate was moving out and I could move in. The only thing was that Max wanted to meet me first and \"approve.\" I had never interacted with Max before, but if she was terrorized (and I do mean terrorized) by the former shitty roommate, then she'd be chill, right? Wrong. \n\n\nI got bad vibes the minute I walked in the door. I've dealt with narcs in every aspect of my life: work, family, friends, lovers. I know one when I meet one. Not trying to sound cocky. I'm not immune, but I am aware. She talked over me, love bombed and made it known that I have to live by HER standards, and anything I ever do in the future to upset her means I'm no better than shitty roommate.\n\n\nIf I was in any other situation, I wouldn't have moved in, but I was running out of couches to crash on. Plus, Jane was on the lease. She's known me forever, knows my character and won't be manipulated into hating me. I didn't know how Max's narcissism would manifest itself, but I had a general idea of what ways things could get ugly, so Jane being my friend and being on the lease made me feel safer. \n\n\nAnd soon Max's ugly side did appear. Not even a month after moving in, I came home early from work and she was lounging about the house in her underwear. There's no foyer so as soon as the door opens your in the living room. \nMax: \"You scared the shit out of me.\"\nMe: \"Sorry.\"\nMax: \"No it's not your fault. You just scared the shit out of me.\"\nShe goes to work, comes back later that night. Jane and I are home chilling at the kitchen table. Max walks in with her boyfriend, who will have no name because he has no will of his own. She proceeds to tell everyone how I scared the shit out of her earlier. I'm not upset about that but it's so repetitive, I know she's trying to make me feel a certain way. \nSo I choose to assert my boundaries. I say jokingly, \"Hey, don't go trying to make me feel guilty for walking into my own house.\" I chuckle. Jane chuckles. Maybe boyfriend chuckles, I don't remember. Max loses it.\nMax: \"I was expressing a FEELING! I'm allowed to EXPRESS myself!\" \nMe: \"Okay. Understood.\"\nMax: \"Damn! What was that about?!\"\nShe storms off to her room and proceeds to yell at boyfriend after she shuts the door.\n\n\nShe gave me the silent treatment for a week. Which to me was a relief. I was sick of her always talking to me and spying on me then making assumptions about me to my face. She literally talks about me to my face. It's creepy. So the silent treatment was a welcome respite. But the silent treatment got awkward so I considered it a mulligan and apologized to her. Then she became nice again. \n\n\nUntil a month later. I got home at quarter to 4 in the morning. I was cooking pasta as a late night drunk snack. Jane was asleep (obviously). Max comes home drunk as a skunk. She was snacking on sunflower seeds and spilled the bag when she put it on the table. \n\n\nShe says she's gonna share her wine with me, so I join her at the kitchen table, but I didn't plan on talking that long. The pasta was still cooking. Bagged tortellini takes forever. She starts telling me some random work story and she's that level of drunk where she has no volume control. Our walls are thin AF. Plus high ceilings so it echos. \nMe: \"Look, I hate it when people say this to me, but Jane's sleeping, maybe consider lowering your voice a little.\"\nMax: \"If you hate it so much why did you just say that to me?!\"\nAnd then she went on a tirade. Insulting my character, claiming I don't take out the trash or do any kind of housework and just going off at full volume. Jane would later reveal that she did indeed wake up. \nI just drained my pasta, fixed it up and went to my room without saying a word to her. \n\n\nAgain, silence for a week. Then she gets a bottle of wine to split with me and we sit down and she admits what she did wasn't cool and out of line. (I have never heard \"sorry,\" come out of her mouth). And she wants to clear the air about the stuff she brought up; the cleaning. She's a complete dictator about the bathroom and our bathroom is immaculate but still doesn't meet her standards. \nI can't complete a sentence, she keeps cutting me off. At that point I figure, I'll keep up my normal cleaning standards and just take it with a grain of salt. What I was trying to tell her was that I always clean up after myself and because I do that, I shouldn't clean up after others regardless of it being a group effort. Jane understands that. She's not harboring resentment about my cleaning habits. At the end of our conversation, it was clear: Max is not actually sorry but has given me permission to keep existing as long as it's on her terms.\n\n\nThe third and final straw was a week after Max's \"apology.\" We have a communal liquor cabinet. Anything in there is open to everyone. There has been a bottle of ros\u00e9 in there since I moved in. I noticed that it had been moved to the fridge 1/4 full. And I thought \"oh cool. I'll have some.\" But then decided let me wait a few days, and if it hasn't been drank, it's gonna go bad, I'll finish it. And that's exactly what I do. Five days since I drank the ros\u00e9 pass and no one has said anything. \nThen Max looks in the fridge as I'm eating dinner and watching Divorce Court. \nMax: \"What happened to my wine?\"\nMe: \"That was yours? I'm sorry. I drank it cuz it was gonna go bad.\"\nMax: \"That's bullshit! Wine doesn't go bad!\"\n(Then how do we get vinegar????)\nMax: \"You're lying! You just wanted to drink it for the sake of drinking it!\" \n\n\nThe details of the fight I'm not 100% clear. But I didn't keep my cool. I broke. I raised my voice too, cuz she kept calling me a liar when I explained myself. She threatened to hit me. I threatened to call the cops. Jane gets involved and starts shrieking about how she's sick of us screaming at each other and how we woke her up the other night. Did that stop Max? Nope. She started yelling at Jane about how mad she is at me over that 1/4 of (disgusting) ros\u00e9. Jane slams the door. Max goes into her room still screaming about me (to boyfriend I guess? I didn't see him come in), then marches back out and takes the tall boy of Coors I had in the fridge, that I had previously offered up as compensation. And we haven't spoken since. Although, it's been about a week so the pattern is about to repeat itself.\nJane chewed us out over text essentially saying she shouldn't live in fear in her own home and we gotta sort out shit out. I agree... if Max were a reasonable human. \n\nNow, this post isn't about the incidents themselves. It's about the pattern. Max never leaves me alone and plays hot and cold. She spies on me. I can literally feel her from behind her door tracking my every move. I'm in the kitchen, seconds later she's in the kitchen too. She acts like we're besties, then picks a fight and the cycle continues. \n\nJane's safe cuz she's on the lease. If Max pulled half of what she pulled on me on Jane, Jane would have her evicted. That's why Max is so sweet to Jane 24/7. I know I have to talk to Jane, but she's adamant about not getting involved, which I want to respect. But, she should at least be aware of how I'm under duress. I'm not asking her to take sides. \n\nI just don't know what to do. I know I'll have to move out at some point, but how do I keep my sanity in the meantime?", "subreddit": "NarcissisticAbuse"}

But I think anyone who has lived through abuse knows it isn't easy to sum it up properly through a post. So I'm just going to try and keep it short. (Remember, I said try lol)\n\nMy mother cheated and divorced my dad when I was 9. my stepfather very quickly moved in. And I don't know when it started really, but he hurt me. 2 years later I was violated, and raped by him. Once I was 14ish the physical abuse stopped from him, I have no idea why. Maybe it seemed too risky? I was more likely to say something I guess, he is smart about it I admit.\n\n In high school I ignored my home life by being with my friends, drinking too much, pretty typical.  I believe that I was raped at 15 at a party, but I'm not sure that's exactly the right word for it. It was completely different from my first experience, because I was unconscious and don't remember it very well at all. \n\nWhen I was 16 i met a guy, and he quickly became my boyfriend, and we were just together ALL the time. He was so unique to me, I was completely swept up in him. I sort of look at it as he \"saved\" me just by being in my life. \n\n5 years later we are married, have a cozy little home, and have an incredible 1 year old daughter. In my mind, my life has turned into my best case scenario based on what I've been through. And I feel immensely grateful for what I have, and wouldn't change a thing. \n\nSo why do I cry at night? Why the nightmares? The anxious feeling like something is off? Sometimes I feel like a train wreck despite the day to day living that I'm actually doing. I was thinking I have no reason to feel this way, and I feel bad because I'm even extraordinarily blessed. So I start thinking of all these possible reasons for my feelings, like is something wrong in my marriage? Is it that party from 6 years ago? I still see my step father, is it that? But as sick as it sounds I'm fine to be around him, it doesn't bother me as much as you'd think, I just feel a little uncomfortable. I've been forced to be around him for so long I have gotten used to it.\n\nI feel like I've been searching, even provoking fights with my husband at times. and I get my feelings very hurt at his frustration for my very frustrating feelings. \n\nEverything is good, so why am I so scared? I'm wondering, is it repressed feelings from the past or something? Or am I just blaming my problems on that? I figure I should see a therapist, but I don't even know how to begin that process.

Scolding though was my father telling me how stupid, worthless, and disappointing I was. In various volumes and intensities, mostly yelling. He'd ask why I did this to him, why I was trying to make him angry. He'd shout and bluster for what felt like hours. I was a petulant shit though so sometimes I'd talk back, snark at him, or just laugh at the beratement and that would immediately escalate things greatly. \n\nSo I learned to shut up and take it.

(which I did not know at the time, nobody knew at the time).\u00a0 My parents went back to MI (from NC) so my mom could get her hair done (where is the sense in that).\u00a0 For some reason, my dad showed up at my brother\u2019s work (Good GOD) and was told he no longer worked there.\u00a0 My dad drove over to the public library where my brother spent most of his time when he was unemployed, living with them, looking for work.\u00a0 He found my brother, saw the contents of his car, and put two and two together.\u00a0 According to my brother, the first thing my dad said was, \u201cWhere\u2019s all your *stuff*?\u201d\n\nMy brother has since moved to Louisiana, to be with his girlfriend.\u00a0 During this Thanksgiving 2015 visit, my mom and my dad had no idea that he\u2019d left MI.\u00a0 I wondered if they worried about him.\u00a0 I worried if it kept them awake at night.\u00a0 It bothered me that my mom, as a mother, might worry about the whereabouts of her children.\u00a0 I debated a lot in my head if I should give her just the basic details that he had moved to Louisiana, was safe, had a girlfriend and his life was moving on.\u00a0 In one of our night time talks, I did tell her.\u00a0 I could see it in her face, her absorbing the material, processing it.\u00a0 The only response I remember her having, with narrowed eyes, was, \u201c*Why would you tell me that?*\u201d\u00a0 So bizarre.\u00a0 It was almost as if she resented hearing that his life had moved on and how dare he live his life despite what *HE\u2019S PUT ME THROUGH.*\n\nI don\u2019t want to spend this entire beautiful Spring morning inside, processing old shit, but I do want to leave on with this last part *I\u2019m* still processing: I don\u2019t think my mom ever loved my brothers or me.\u00a0 I don\u2019t think she\u2019s capable of love.\u00a0 I can\u2019t remember, literally, any interaction between my mom and I were I felt, \u201cThis is what love and acceptance feels like.\u201d\u00a0 It was more like a \u201cHere\u2019s your food, clothing, shelter and now you owe me.\u201d\u00a0 These realizations, at age 38, give me some clarity, but they still haunt me.\u00a0 There\u2019s no resolution to this situation.\u00a0 It\u2019s frozen in time and is what it is.\u00a0 What do I take from this?\u00a0 How do I not let it bleed into my present day life and relationships?\u00a0 At the very core of me, there is an emptiness.\u00a0 A longing.\u00a0 Part of me that will never feel fulfilled.\u00a0 How do you live with wounds like this, damaged inflicted when you were young, and find peace and love as an adult?\u00a0 Healing is the answer.\u00a0 Focus on the healing.", "subreddit": "NarcissisticAbuse"}

He was really fixated in particular on a guy I had had a casual relationship prior to knowing my Nex, I think this was solely because he was also a good looking guy - he was out of my life and I never lied or did anything sketchy with him but he was still so jealous. Admittedly one time when he was going on and on about this person I did say something like \"well he actually is taller than you\" it was honestly me just being matter of fact in the middle of a jealous tirade, I wasn't trying to be insulting although I would say it wasn't a smart thing to say but I hadn't meant to be malicious. For years to come he would bring up how I was shallow and I didn't like him cause he wasn't tall enough. I can remember now for a long time always feeling a bit confused because I couldn't understand why he cared so much about a guy I had never had any real feelings for but asked nothing about the men I had dated and loved before him - if he was going to care about my  past it seemed like wouldn't he care more about the people I had actually really cared about? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnyway at some point that thought faded and I became sort of convinced that I was really that shallow, I was scared to leave because what if I wouldn't be attracted to other men if they weren't as tall or as good looking or that any \"nice guy\" wouldn't be fulfilling sexually (he had a real problem with me wanting him to be a \"nice guy\" which I think he saw as being pathetic), then I'd resent myself for feeling that way and being so shallow and it's just a big nasty cycle. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nCut to finally being NC and moving on and am now having the nice realization that I'm not this horribly shallow person - I have no desire to be with my Nex and am dating people and re-learning that my attraction to people grows naturally and based on their character/actions. There's a great freedom and satisfaction in knowing that my Nex would be so confused to see who I am dating and that I'm not the shallow person he had me pegged as.

That was what I (thought I) wanted. Given that I had crawled back to him after every discard, he made it very clear the ball was in his court. And I knew the rules - stay quiet on shady behaviour, don\u2019t keep on questioning, swallow the bullshit and don\u2019t expect him to change anything (controlling). \n\nBut I..... just..... could NOT shut up. For example - \n\nAfter he discarded me, I caved and went back after seeing a girl in his insta. Few weeks later. Could not help myself. But then the convo falls back into old ways. \n\nThings appear to be going well, but I can\u2019t help myself but ask about her. He gets mad, tells me I have no right to know, etc. Tells me I can\u2019t control him and I\u2019m out of my life. But equally I shouldn\u2019t be worried. Tells me he\u2019s going to bed, and we\u2019ll talk tomorrow. Tells me I\u2019ve given him something to think about. He still has feelings for me. And I shouldn\u2019t be worried about anyone else. \n\nI think to myself, here\u2019s your chance Mimi. Stay quiet. Just don\u2019t message him and he\u2019ll call tomorrow and it will be back to how it was before. \ud83d\udc95 You can do this. Just shut up. If you message he\u2019ll definitely discard you. \n\nAnxiety builds. \n\nI try and stay quiet. But nope! I must know who that girl is! Something feels wrong!! I go in. I question, I question, I accuse even. My gut is telling me something is off. But I KNOW if I just stay quiet, he\u2019ll stick around. But..... nope! \n\nI start an argument, or at least start questioning him. And - predictably this pushes him away. \u201cYou\u2019ve just proved to me you don\u2019t change\u201d. A huge fight ensued where I continue to accuse and fight and question. \n\nHe just reiterates how I\u2019ve proved to him I don\u2019t change. And that\u2019s the end of that. Discarded for good. Does this shut me up? Hell no! I get even MORE upset and MORE accusatory and even a little mean. He just tells me to fuck off repeatedly but I\u2019m on one. Start questioning about everything and everyone. \n\nLike, WTF? This happened MULTIPLE times throughout the relationship too. Mostly it would be me trying desperately to get an answer from him that made sense, to ease the anxiety my gut was alarming. But of course I never got answers that made sense. Because the behaviour in itself was a red flag. However minor it appeared. \n\nps. I turned out to be right being worried about that girl. They are now together. Figures.\n\n\nMy issue is.... I wanted him. I wanted him around - at least I thought. I knew what I could do to make this happen (I thought, but perhaps it wouldn\u2019t work either). So why in the world was I deliberately exhibiting behaviours that I KNEW would push him away, cause a fight and lead him to discard???\n\nI was unable to quieten my emotions and think rationally for 5 seconds and in the process let out behaviours that went completely against what I wanted, as well as heightening my anxiety. \n\nThese behaviours were the DEFINITION of compulsive because I was fully aware of the negative consequences but I felt desperate to message him. Even though I was aware where it would lead me. I could not stop myself. I just needed to message. Or question. Or anything. \n\nNot to mention my behaviour is pretty awful, and has me questioning who\u2019s really the bad guy here.

We\u2019d smoke cigarettes together, laugh, memes, and just generally be so happy. She was such a great personality. We had so much in common so much compatibility.\n\nThere were times I saw red flags and usually ignored them.

She didn\u2019t know how to tell me what was wrong besides \u201cdon\u2019t do it.\u201d And of course, like a dumb kid I said it accidentally.\n\nI then asked about her friend X, as he was living in a country that coincides with my work, and she called me a weirdo for even trying to know about him or his life. \n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know what he does\u201d \u201chow do you not know?\u201d \u201cDon\u2019t you get I\u2019m trying not to tell you?

So do I need therapy, or just the 'threat' of therapy? \n2. I specifically want solo therapy and he made me listen to this pitch about how group therapy might be better. And that he won't force me into it - but that it's the best strategy. Which is essentially forcing me into it by saying 'you can choose this and heal or choose that and probably not heal as quickly or as well.'\n3. This is the big one. HE SAID HE WAS SORRY FOR WHAT I'D BEEN THROUGH. I know people say that all the time. Hell, I've said it - I've probably even said it ON THIS SUBREDDIT because even though I know better, I'm still a human and I find it hard to articulate empathy. But the difference is, I'm a layman and he's a professional. And it honestly staggered me a bit, to hear that, because I don't want an apology. Not from him. Not from my abuser. Not from anybody. Apologies don't mean anything to me - they're empty words, and to hear them from a trauma therapist is like the ultimate cliche. To ask me about trauma and then reply with some soft-voiced 'i'm so sad to hear that'... no thanks. I came to this guy hoping that because he specialized with men he'd understand that some people don't like being talked to like a child. I replied with self deprecation and he was concerned for my self-esteem after, but my self-esteem is fine. I got over the shame of abuse a long time ago. An apology feels like a slap in the face, honestly.  \n\n\nSo am I nuts to feel kind of let down by this? I honestly have been to enough therapists that they all mistrust me and I can tell - they know I know how they 'work.' He even said I probably know about 'these things' because of it. And apologized for all the shitty therapists I've known. Funny thing is - they always do. Every time. And still screw up. So again: meaningless.  \n\n\nI'm not trying to diminish apologies for the people who take comfort in them. If it works for you, I'm glad it brings you comfort - I mean that. But for me it just feels like he's missing the point. I'm not some sad little kid anymore looking for protection and safety. I'm a fully functional adult whose trauma happened to give him some issues with maintaining romantic, sexual relationships. I'm an adult whose trauma gave him kinks he doesn't want because they remind him of being abused. Those are the things I want help solving, and practically. 'I'm sorry' doesn't help me solve anything and is about as sincere as a hallmark card. Just once I'd love a therapist to just not say anything when I tell them what I went through. Why do they all feel like they have to react?  \n\n\nI don't know. Anyone else hate 'too nice' therapists? The soft voice, gentle attitude, etc... it all just seems creepy to me. Granted most of my abuse happened with that sort of 'faux nice' persuasion to it, so that's probably why it bothers me, but man, it BOTHERS me. It just comes off as sleazy more than anything, even when I know it isn't. I feel like I've tried every 'school' of therapy under the sun and I've yet to find one that just acts like a drill sergeant or something. 'Stop fucking this one thing up, son. Here's your orders. Do that. Stop this.' That's what I need. And I have no idea if there are any therapists out there who get that some people LIKE tough love, because it works for them the best. I really hoped a guy who specializes in dealing with guys would at least kind of pick up on that. But I guess it's an industry standard.  \n\n\nI'm not gonna quit - not yet at least. I'll give it more time to 'kick in.' But my hopefulness has been cut in half. It's just more of the same, it feels like.  \n\n\nDoes anyone else ever get this feeling? Does anyone else get bothered by this? I can't be the only one - I just can't be.", "subreddit": "survivorsofabuse"}

My parents harp me with all sorts of demeaning, nasty remarks of how spoiled I was or how selfish I was for putting my own health before my family... for example, my sister always gets $300 for hair color every month and if I asked my mother for $20 every once in a while for a new game or something, she would go Momzilla and call me a selfish brat who demands too much of the family. My walls are barren, my desk is run down, my night table is almost splitting apart, my bedroom lamp is in shackles, just imagine Cinderella\u2019s bedroom... I have almost nothing besides a used cell phone to call \u201cproperty\u201d. My sister on the other hand, does nothing to contribute to the family, whines about doing any sort of housework and somehow ends up never doing it, and still is rewarded with new clothes, the latest makeup, and she just got a new cell phone too. I don\u2019t understand why. We\u2019ll occasionally take trips to Disneyland for 3 days but all my Mom wants is pictures. She doesn\u2019t even really enjoy the rides anymore... but I digress. My father, whom has abandoned us 3 times in the past, is the secondary target of my mothers absolutely hypocritical and disgraceful language and accusations. She blames him if a house maintenance worker shows up late from traffic, she blames him if my sister acts out over a petty situation, she even blames him for my grandfather needing a metal hip operation. She never seems to be in the wrong however. She condemns swearing, but cusses my father and I out almost daily, she hates the use of technology but almost always has her nose buried in Facebook trying to sweet talk her \u201cfriends\u201d into believing she\u2019s a literal angel. Plus she talks so much shit behind our backs and practically pits the members of the house against each other, as if we were born to entertain her. I can\u2019t take anymore of it! The worst part, when I bring up anything that could bring any negativity to my mother\u2019s private, household reputation, I\u2019m told to shut the fuck up and deal with it. I cry myself to sleep almost every single night. I hate having to survive emotionally in such a primal manner. No person should have to argue with their own family over something as petty as how long someone took a shower the night before or who used the most data on the phone plan. My mother drives the anger train in me and she knows she does. She constantly instigates situations in which I have to argue endlessly while she keeps mimicking everything I say unless it\u2019s a swear word, in which case she\u2019ll slap me dead across the face... I\u2019ve told therapists, counselors, even friends about the situation at home and nobody believes me... I can\u2019t live like this forever... help!

Of course, there's so much more to it, but that's enough for context.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis story in particular is about one of those hours-long, torturous conversations we had after I found out he cheated.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHe comes over to my place and sets the tone early on by telling me that he loves me, that it didn't feel like what he did with the other guy detracted from what we had, that this is the most important relationship of his life and that he'd considered moving in with me.  (Aside: This was amazingly romantic at the time bc I'd never had anyone tell me these things before, but looking back at it now, just, ugh.  He was telling me these things like I'd won a prize and, of course, like it was my fault that we weren't moving in together / having the future I wanted.)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe go back and forth for an hour talking very abstractly about philosophy and the nature of relationships.  He's a word salad type with a background in lit / arts / critical theory so this got wildly pretentious.  I'll spare the details, but after what amounted to a dissertation defense of my right to feel hurt he ended up giving me an ultimatum: \"You need to choose between monogamy and me.\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI was totally baffled by that.  I couldn't understand how he'd said everything he said, listened to everything I said, and then come out with a statement like that at the end of it.  It didn't add up.  I had a flare of anger and excused myself to the bathroom to recollect.  (Of course, he called behind to chide me for walking out on the conversation -- again, ugh.)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhen I came back to the bedroom I laid everything out for him as clearly as I could.  1) I never once said that I wanted strict monogamy and you need to stop putting that on me -- I only ever said that I wanted you to respect where my boundaries are and work with me on finding ones that suit us as a couple; 2) to say that I need to make a choice per that ultimatum is to imply that you're okay with either outcome, which is to imply that you're totally fine with me leaving, and that's my real problem here; and 3) the inverse of that ultimatum could just as easily apply to you: what if I said that you had to choose between non-monogamy and me?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHe gave me word salad in response, because of course he did.  I can't fully remember all of it since it didn't add up to a coherent point, but it included affirmations like \"of course I don't want you to leave\" mixed in with lacerations like \"I used to think I wanted monogamy back when I was insecure too...\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAs I'm processing the word salad the session comes to an abrupt end when -- again, of course -- he realizes it's late and he needs to get to sleep for work.  At 10pm.  So he spontaneously becomes groggy, I wouldn't want to be dramatic and keep him up would I?, no, so I turn off the light and we go to sleep.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNone of that is the breakthrough I had tonight -- it's all stuff I've processed and come to terms with piece by piece over the past several months.  Bear with me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTwo hours later he's snoring, but I'm still reeling with emotions.  I nudge him awake.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\"Max, are you awake?\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\"Yeah, hey.\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\"I wanted to say a few things.\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\"Okay, what's up?\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\"Well... Just, about the ultimatum thing earlier.  If it came down to monogamy vs. you, I wanted to say that of course I'd pick you.  I want you to be your full self and to be happy and if we're just in different phases of life right now and that's what you need then I want to work with that and support you.  And I really hope you'd answer the same about non-monogamy.  What we have is just really, really special to me.  I've never had this kind of connection before, never felt so understood, never had so much in common.  I haven't been this happy since I was a kid.  It just feels so much more exciting and meaningful than whatever hookups might be out there and I want to make sure that we honor it.  To me, that isn't some repressive, heteronormative ideology, it's as natural as anything.  And I don't want us to be co-dependent -- it's important to me that we have our own lives, that we can watch each other succeed and enjoy it, that we can practice trust with each other.  But... it's hard for me to say this, but just, there are definitely ways in which I feel like I need you.  And I think it's okay to need people for things sometimes.  I hope you need me for some things too and I want to be there for whatever those are.  I guess you could say that I've gotten attached, but Max, I really do love you.\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\"...\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\"...\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\"...\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\"... Max?\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\"Huh?  Hey, what's up?\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\"I just... I just opened up and told you a bunch of really vulnerable things, were you asleep?\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\"Yeah, it's the middle of the night.\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\"I mean, I checked first and we talked for a bit, you seemed really alert so it's just a surprise --\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\"Why are you so upset?\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\*turns away, forces self not to cry in front of him\\*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMe: \"... I'm not upset.  You're right, it's the middle of the night.  I just am feeling a lot of very complicated emotions right now and I'm trying to figure out whether I want to attempt to repeat what I just said.\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\"Well, I'm awake now.\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\*Sheepishly repeats the speech.\\*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\"... Jay, I just don't see why this has to be happening in the middle of the night and I can't believe you're upset with me for having been asleep the first time.\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\"How could you possibly be trying to argue with me about that right now?  I don't care about earlier, do you not have anything to say about what I just said to you?\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\"You're the one who's upset, I was literally just sleeping!\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\*I get out of bed and stand up in the dark\\*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMe, after a pause: \"Listen, can I just paint this? I feel like --\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\"Paint?? What do you mean paint?\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\"... I was just saying, I feel like the basic thing that's happening here is that I'm saying 'love love love love' and you're saying 'argue argue argue argue,' and I don't know why that's happening, but can you please just give me 'love love love love?'  Please?\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\"Yes.  Jay, I love you.  Please come to bed.\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\*We have sex.\\*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHim, cuddling after as we start to nod off, under his breath, mumbling: \"Does it feel like I love you now?\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI didn't sleep for the rest of the night, just laid there in his arms feeling violated, not understanding yet why I felt violated, crying intermittently, hating him, loving him, hating myself, hating myself some more.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA lot of things about this exchange stuck out as fucked up very early on in my healing process, 1) because there's just so much classic narc behavior on display here and 2) because it's the night I revisit most often when I'm flashing back.  But, what I just realized tonight, and what I genuinely can't believe didn't occur to me until now, the better part of a year later, is that this fucker absolutely, 100% certainly did not sleep through a single word that I said.  He heard every breath of it and pretended to have been asleep just to fuck with me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThat possibility never would have occurred to me before, because I didn't understand before that he was hurting me intentionally.  I'm gonna post later about narcs and intention, but this is long enough as is.  Just wanted to vent some anger for now, and to say that wow, I still have so much healing left to do if I'm only just now picking up on stuff like this.  It's a journey, y'all.

A little background, we\u2019ve been together seven years, married for five, he wanted to be married before I started university. So I was married really young. \nRecently I was going to spend the day with my mom and he was going to help his dad with something. I was out with my mom and he kept asking when I would be home, apparently something came up and his plans were canceled. I had road with my mom so she was going to drive me home. I live next door to my grandparents so we stopped by to see them real quick. I texted him and told him I was right next door, next thing I know he is pulling out of the driveway leaving our house. So I called him and asked where he was going and he said he had no idea where I was so he was going to eat. I had text him and told him exactly where I was. He would\u2019ve seen my moms truck because we live that close. \nToday my sister called and wanted me to ride into town with her, she had to go to work so we would\u2019ve been gone two hours tops. As soon as he saw she was calling me he was watching me to see what she wanted. So, I told her I couldn\u2019t go. All he was doing was sitting on the couch watching tv, I don\u2019t understand why I have to sit and do nothing with him. \nAnother thing that happened a while back was he completely ignored everyone at my sisters birthday dinner. They would talk to him and he just wouldn\u2019t respond. He does this on and off, sometimes he chats nonstop and others he acts like he hates them. There\u2019s a lot of other little things but these are the main ones I could think of. \nMost of the time he\u2019s overly affectionate, he\u2019ll say I love you so much that it doesn\u2019t have any meaning anymore. He\u2019ll randomly buy me nice things, but gets upset if I buy them for myself. I know this is a lot of word vomit but I\u2019m just curious if anyone else has experienced this. Is it normal?

I had a 4 year long same-sex relationship with a friend from high school. Now, this will come into play as pretty much the root of the abuse, but I'll get to that.\n\nJust a warning, this is gonna be long because I feel like I need to vent a little. **TL;DR at the bottom.**\n\nI was 16 when we first met and 17 when I confessed my undying love to her. This may sound childish but everyone has done dumb things in their youth. She was everything I've ever wanted to have for myself: she was confident, loud, always speaking her mind, had a circle of great friends and she was free (in my definition anyway, meaning, she could get out of the house, whilst I could not).\n\nShe was surprised at my confession and said that if I gave her 3 days, she'll figure out what she wanted with that info. I was so anxious I actually developed a fever and had to stay home from school for the next few days. When the 3 days were done, she told me that she'd date me for 2 months, and then decide if she loved me or not. I accepted.\n\nThings were fine for a while, although she told me to keep our relationship a secret. I wanted to come out because I felt guilty for not telling my parents, but I kept it a secret for her sake. The two months passed. In hindsight, she could've told me not to worry because she wanted to continue our relationship, but she let me cry and get so anxious I felt sick, but she just wouldn't tell me that she'll be with me until the \"deadline\". Looking back I think this is a play on me fearing losing her, and then being so glad that she stayed that I'll just worship her more.\n\nThen came a moment that was kinda the first strike for me, but I brushed it off because she gave a \"reasonable\" explanation. Basically she went out drinking with friends (we're still underage btw) and called me the next day, crying that she's so so sorry, but she kissed with a guy the previous night. She told me that she always goes around kissing strangers at parties while drunk, and beacuse our relationship was a secret, she *just had to do it,* otherwise it'd look weird. I thought that this was a good explanation, and even though it hurt a lot, I promised to forgive her and never speak of this again.\n\nA few months later she told me that in a year, she'd be leaving for college and that at that time, she'd break up with me. I was devastated. I didn't understand and she wouldn't give me a good explanation. She told me she didn't want to be in a long distance relationship, and I argued that she'd still live the next town over and ride the train to college every day, again, I was told not to speak of this beacuse it distressed her. So I stayed quiet.\n\nBecause our relationship was a secret, we only met 2 days a week. We didn't really have too much time with each other. This was a long time ago and I don't remember much of this time, so I'll skip ahead. I'll just add that during this time, I still couldn't tell anyone about us and she publicly denied being with anyone, when asked. Still, I wasn't angry at her, because I felt I was protecting her.\n\nIn the weeks she was leaving for college, I started to get anxious again. On a day I was supposed to go partying with friends (the *one time my mom let me*) she called me to come over because her parents weren't home. I skipped the party and spent the night with her.\n\nThe next morning she didn't talk to me. I asked her what was wrong, if I hurt her. She just told me to leave and pretty much kicked me out of the house. I went home and she told me over MSN messenger (yes, that was still a thing) that last night when we had sex she hadn't felt anything. She told me she was breaking up with me. She told me that I had time to prepare for this because she told me this would happen a year ago. But this time she had a, I guess, better explanation.\n\nShe said that she wants to know what sex is like with guys, and if she's with me, she'd never know. So she wants to go to college, basically to fuck around, and when the term is over and she likes guys better than me, she'll stay with some dude. She was confident she'd have a boyfriend in 8 months time. But, if she doesn't like it and I'm willing to wait for her, once I graduated high school, she'd *let me come back to her*.\n\nNow I see this weird *I'm-setting-deadlines-for-you* pattern that I haven't seen at the time. Again, I accepted.\n\n3 days later she came crawling back to me, telling me how she missed me and that she'll never love anyone as much as she loves me. I accepted her back. I wish I could go back to slap some sense into my 19 year old self.\n\nAt that point, we both came out to our parents and some of our friends. Their reaction was mixed and not very relevant to the story, other than her parents telling me that if they see me, they'll beat the crap out of me. \n\nI thought everything was fine, but then I went to (the same) college as her, and we moved in together. And believe it or not, *this* is when the real shit started to happen.\n\n* First, the jealousy. She was constantly accusing me of cheating on her. She was telling me that I loved my friends more than her and that hurt her. I didn't have many friends, and I pretty much never saw them outside of school (because I had to work part-time), but I saw them less frequently than I would've wanted. They went out for parties, and my gf told me I shouldn't go because I didn't even like parties to begin with. I believed her. For the longest time, I introduced myself as the person she told me I was, not who I really was. Whenever I did go out with friends, she would make me feel shit about myself for weeks. Whenever I would see male friends, she'd turn my phone and laptop backgrounds to gay porn, because she knew I didn't like men (at the time anyway). Even though she knew about my sexual abuse attempt in the past, she'd still do this kinda stuff.\n* Second, she was lying to me constantly, and when I called her out on it, she'd lie again and say I imagined it. On one occasion, she was cutting something with a knife *on the bed* despite me telling her to do it at the table, and *the next day* I found the knife, *STILL IN THE BED WHERE WE SLEPT THE LAST NIGHT.* Immediately, she told me it wasn't her. Then she started making up stories how the knife got there. Nothing was comprehensive, she couldn't talk her way out of this one. I was standing my ground. She gave me the silent treatment, and later at lunch she started bragging to our house-mates how her ex was sending her sexual messages over Facebook and how good it made her feel.\n* On this note, she always tried to make me jealous when we went out. When we met new people, she would never say I was her girlfriend, and she would flirt with guys. One time I pulled her over at a party and told her to stop it. She acted like she didn't know what was going on. She told me that if I thought that guy was flirting with her (and not the other way around of course), I should be more agressive and make it look like she really was mine. Needless to say, after years of telling me that I was only a human being because she made me better, prettier and smarter, I didn't have the confidence, and later was told that if it was my responsibility, she'd be easily stolen from me by some dude.\n* And the humiliation. She\u2019d constantly put me second when it came to friends or family, but would scold me for not being with her enough. Keep in mind, I was working and going to school, she was only doing college and going home to her parents for weekends, so whatever free time I had, I spent it alone. Still, whenever we went out on a date, she\u2019d humiliate me in front of waiters, store clerks, or other friends. She was getting a kick out of how confident she could act and how attractive people found her but not me. I was basically nothing without her.\n\nRealization hit me when I began working at a place which was not an office, meaning I absolutely had to socialize and share me experiences. The people there were baffled how this girl was treating me and they started pointing out the abusive behaviors I was blind to before. At this time, she was starting to panic because I started kinda calling her out and saying no to her more, not agreeing with everything. I was also a bit suspicious that she might read my messages, so I locked my phone and laptop. My fears were confirmed when she jokingly asked me why I would lock my phone and if she could have the passcode. I didn\u2019t give it to her.\n\nThis triggered her to be more defensive and wanted to accompany me everywhere. She came to my workplace, came to school at the end of my classes to walk me home. When I finally could go out with friends, she told me she wanted to come too. She was making me feel crushed under this constant surveillance. She was scared I was talking to people about our \"problems\".\n\nSo one day I broke. I told her I needed more space, that she was too much. She thought for a while, and told me that she's figured it out, my problem is that she's not with me enough! That I felt lonely without her. I thought I was going insane at this point. I didn't see a way out.\n\nSo this time I gave her a deadline and told her that she had one month to give me more freedom, otherwise it's over. Needless to say, in 3 days, she called me when I was at my workplace and demanded to know if I wanted to be with her or not. I told her no, I do not. She told me how no one will ever love me the way she did, hung up, packed her stuff and left our apartment that night. The next day she wrote me a 3 page essay about how heartbroken she was and how much I've hurt her. When I told her how hurt I was in response, she accused me of attacking her when she's so weak and vulnerable. \n\nAs anyone would, I spent the next few months drinking the pain away. This was not my proudest time. I moved into a different apartment and started a new life there. Still, my (now) ex girlfriend would text me bi-weekly. She wanted to know how I was. She was *worried* about me. She wanted to *save me*. She was constantly dosing me with her presence, and I just couldn't let go. So as you would imagine, one day she visited me at my apartment and she manipulated me into having sex with her. She didn't say it out loud, but her body language and the way she was sitting so close to me our faces almost touched, I knew that's what she wanted. \n\nThe next morning she told me that she couldn't do this anymore, because she was seeing a guy and she wouldn't want to cheat on him. I couldn't believe this. Once again, I felt heartbroken and cheated. We went our seperate ways, and later a mutual friend of ours told me that my ex told her that she only had sex with me to confirm that she has no feelings for me anymore. I felt even more abused than before. This time, she literally used my body for her own needs.\n\nShe continued to text me for months when I finally had enough and told her to leave me alone. She agreed to only text me once a month, to which I replied that she probably won't even give me that. She didn't text me at all afterwards, and now I have her blocked on every platform possible.\n\n# TL;DR:\n\nIt's been over 3 years now that I broke up with her, and I've been in the most wonderful relationship for 1,5 years now, but I'm still angry and feel permanently scarred. I do not wish to see her or talk to her anymore, I do not miss her, I'm simply angry and disgusted by how unfairly I was treated. Most days I do not think about her anymore, but when I do, I still get anxious and I want it to stop, but I'm not sure how. \n\n# Conclusion\n\nWhat I'm really looking for is confirmation that my feelings are not invalid. I don't think I've ever told this story in such detail before to anyone, because I still feel like my feelings are invalid and that this may not count as abuse after all. I'm still confused by these feelings. I do not miss her. I do not want to see her. I do not want to talk to her. I cannot think of our relationship without feeling angry, cheated and abused. But, it has been over 3 years since it's been over, and I am still angry, despite the fact that I've been in a great relationship for almost 1,5 years now (with a guy, yay!), and generally I'm feeling pretty good about myself. However, I'm confused as to why I sometimes still feel this way, and I'm unsure if my feelings and thoughts are valid. I've wanted to post this yesterday, but I got scared and figured that my story is not that bad anyway, and that this may not have been abuse, I'm just too sensitive. Even though I know it to be just that, it still *feels* wrong to say it is. \n\nAm I wrong about this being abuse?", "subreddit": "emotionalabuse"}

I was very much a codependent people-pleaser (gradually getting better at saying \"no\" and setting boundaries these days), and I deeply loved this man. He had a very sweet, loving, sensitive side, but a *very* scary side when he lost his temper, which was increasingly often. I've always been a \"caretaker\" in relationships, and I naively thought if I just loved him more, put more effort into the relationship, and focused more on supporting him, we'd eventually have a happy relationship.

I cooked the majority of meals, took care of our pets, worked two jobs, did the laundry and most of the dishes, and random other chores.

I've been within him for over 2 years and I love him, but I'm at a vulnerable place in my life as we're both leaving uni this year and thinking about finding a place to move in together (we already live together, but in temporary student housing). I don't feel like I'm capable of going it alone, even if I could figure out how to stop wanting to be with him despite how he behaves sometimes... To make matters worse, I keep doubting myself because I have a massive and persistent (3-year-long) crush on one of my best friends (the only person I've expressed doubts about my relationship to) who repeatedly suggests that I leave. I don't want to leave my boyfriend if it's just about my feelings for my friend - I'd feel terrible! I feel like I can't trust my own doubts over my boyfriend because of this, as I already feel disloyal just for having feelings for a friend (who also recently became single for the first time since I met them, making my feelings all the more difficult to ignore).\n\nDoes anybody have any advice on what my next steps should be or what I should consider next?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEDIT: For those wondering about context, my boyfriend is quite... volatile is the word, I suppose. He's lovely 90% of the time, but quick to anger. Stress makes him lash out, raise his voice or punch/throw things (not me, he's never physically hurt me).\n\nWhen we have arguments, if I don't back down quickly things escalate and he has called me \"cunt\", \"psychopath\", \"manipulator\", \"bitch\", etc. in the past. I've tried to ask him not to do this, but he genuinely seems to believe it's okay in these situations. He says I'm trying to deny him the ability to express his feelings, as when he says such things it's because I'm making him feel like I really am those things. He claims he has to call me those things to get through to me (when fights escalate, I shut down and \"zone out\" due to the stress of the shouting). This only makes him angrier, and it sometimes escalates to him breaking down in tears and asking me why I'm even with him if I don't care about him. I care about him an awful lot, but I'm not the best at showing it when I'm under stress like that.\n\nIn the day-to-day things are largely great, but he's particular about certain things. I don't think he's *super* controlling, but I do feel like I often have to tell him where I'm going or who I'm seeing. He gets very jealous, and has accused me of flirting when I've got too close to or talked to long with people at social gatherings. I have lied before about who I'm with or where I am because I was worried it would upset him somehow. I've become very nervous, and sometimes my anxiety is unfounded and something I think was going to really bother him turns out not to. Other times it's the opposite; I overlook something and it messes everything up. Today I watched an episode of GoT without him and I'm bricking it worried he'll find out and be upset.\n\nI've never before had a non-mutual break up. I've broken up with two people, but it was mutual, both parties knew it was over. My boyfriend loves me, says he would be lost without me. He's not in a very good place mentally at the moment, and I worry what would happen if I left him. I feel like I can't do that to him, it would be cruel.

I thought it was just because I got dumped because naturally I hated her neurotypical ex  for dumping her too. But she just called me and told me that she slept with her ex, that it helped her find her place with him. She understands that they\u2019ll both always have a spot in their heart for each other, but that they will always respect each other and they just weren\u2019t perfect for each other. \n\nI, on the other hand, haven\u2019t spoken to my nex in months since he sent me pictures, triangulating me, who he led on saying it was just a break, with his new girl. Since he went from treating me like a queen to laying out every single thing that\u2019s wrong with me. Since he abused me emotionally and sexually. But our no contact??? HE did that. I reached out. He didn\u2019t answer. \n\nI WANT what my friend has. A mutual respect for each other as exes. But there was no respect in my relationship. I still talk about him, probably once a week to her, and he\u2019s out living his best life, with no regard to me.

We are both graduate students in an extremely competitive program. After being together about 1 year, I decided to end it in October 2018 because I couldn't deal with the emotional strain - it distracted me from both my schoolwork and myself. I knew who she was, I knew that she took medication for a psychological disorder and I know her mother has NPD/BPD. After being cheated on, lied to, manipulated, drained financially, abused verbally and physically, and distracted from my career goals, I told her NO MORE. But 4 days later she went to NOT THE POLICE, BUT THE SCHOOL and reported that I was abusive, a morally deviant individual, and someone who was responsible for extremely dangerous things that placed hundreds of other students at risk. Lies, lies, lies. I told the school who she was and what she was doing. I told the school I was fearful of my life. Things got quiet. At first she chose not to pursue an investigation but I was devastated. Broken. Humiliated. The rumors she spread went around like wildfire. One student to the next, without them even confronting me. She lied about my parents, my family... I was wrecked and emotionally buried for months but as I started to come out, I thought that the school saw her manipulative and vengeful behavior and decided it was going to be okay.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nUntil 3 months later in January - I decided I wanted to explore the dating world in a city I had only lived in for a short time. For 90% of this short time I was dating this evil monster, didn't even realize who she was... But I decided to make a Hinge account - \"let me see what is out there\" mentality. I ended up matching with one of her friends. Two days later, she decides to move forward with the investigation and reports EVERY weakness she knows about me plus the infamous N-twist on it to make it severely damaging. And since then it has NOT stopped. Not only was she dating a school professor within weeks of reporting this back in October, she was all over every guy in the class making sure to alienate me from everyone. Luckily, my good friends knew her and who she is and have been by my side since day one. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow I find out yesterday that she reported that I was responsible for something extremely dangerous - that I participated in behavior that endangered the lives of hundreds of students. This was not made initially available to me in January but now I see why I was removed from school and forced to learn from home. Forced to travel hours away to complete necessary educational requirements. But at this point, after everything I have provided to the school, after everything I showed - from text messages, to pictures, to stories, to witnesses - they still want to move forward and believe they will find me responsible for things that I never did. I am hopeless. I have multiple attorneys helping me and they are dumbfounded on how the fuck this all got this far. How does the school not understand? I respect the #MeToo movement and I am very supportive of women's rights and I have a mother and sister who I love and adore. I come from a good family, a family with morals, and I was raised to respect and love. I am a good person who got attached to a monster and all my hard work, all of my blood, sweat, and tears are now in jeopardy. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHow can it be her word against mine? How can they just allow her to spread these things without corroboration when less than a week before she reported this, she was telling me she wanted to marry me? I have these texts... Why is it she was engaged 3x before, why is it she has had 3 abortions, a miscarriage, and a child she said is \"a mistake I've been trying to get away from\"... Why is it she is a racist pig who disgusts Hispanics and African-Americans (which I have texts and audio clips to back up), but yet after we break up she goes and befriends the Hispanics and African-Americans in our class. Why does she get to neglect her kid, sleep around with every guy in the city, drink every night, bully and harass, date a professor, have a history of filing numerous orders of protection, accuse every ex of being abusive, and then admit  to the school that she hit and punch me - and then I am the one who faces the system and is being knocked down at every turn.... while she goes on with her life, smiling but hating everyone. Because she is superficially beautiful? She is the ugliest thing I have ever laid eyes on.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI have not spoken to her or spoke about her or spread anything about her. I have kept everything inside and I have behaved myself. I wanted to send these racist texts and videos to her friends of different ethnicities but I held back because I thought it was the right thing to do. Not to be vengeful Because her daughter is 1/2 African-American and the news would be devastating. Her daughter is a charming, wonderful, beautiful young girl who I miss dearly. But I feel awful to know that whenever my nex feels like seeing her daughter (maybe once every 2 months), she agrees to take care of her for a day or 2. I would have given that girl the world, my parents would have taken her in with no questions asked. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis is the most devastating situation I have ever been in... And I am in the process of writing a book. There is so so so much more to this and I am going to share my story. There is a ton here and it is as unbelievable for many but for people like us, who know these people, it is just another day. But for now I have boards coming up and I have to fight for my life.

I know so much more now than I knew at 22. I was an idiot. We met online and he claimed to have Asperger\u2019s syndrome. He sucked me in by telling me how horrible, but beautiful, his ex was and how she had cruelly ripped his heart out. They had also met online and he complained that she loved him over text but not in person. He said a lot of nasty stuff about her but painted himself as the perfect boyfriend. \n\nBeing young and dumb I wanted to prove that I was a better person than his perfect blonde ex. We started dating, long distance, after he begged and guilt tripped me. He didn\u2019t have a job and lived at home. He had started going to college but had failed out after his step brother and grandmother had died in close succession. I thought it made sense that he was taking time to himself and ignored these and other red flags, like that he didn\u2019t have a drivers license and he felt justified in calling his ex a cunt because she didn\u2019t want to be with him.\n\nHe thought very, very highly of himself. He considered himself genius-level intelligent, and would remark after we had been dating for a while about how the stuff that I knew about was all stupid stuff that didn\u2019t matter, but the stuff that he knew was important. He was, in his mind, morally and emotionally perfect. He was the kindest, most thoughtful person in the world, in his own mind. But his actions didn\u2019t align with this, I would discover as we dated for longer. He was just so in love with himself and his own feelings. \n\nWe kept it online for a few months, and then I flew out to meet him, using my own money. He picked me up from the airport with his mom. He was very overweight/in bad shape and not attractive to me but I felt that I had to accept these things or else I was just as bad as his ex. As soon as we got back to his house and were alone in his room he tried to initiate sex, in the middle of the day, after my long flight and with his mom and sister right in the next room. It was uncomfortable. He would do this the other times I traveled out to see him, too \u2014 once I drove, 12 hours in one day, to visit, and as soon as I walked in the door he gave me a big hug and then pulled his dick out! Ugh. \n\nI was visiting for a week and he ignored me pretty much the entire time, except for meal times and right before bed when he wanted sex. He was literally on his computer playing MUDs or Everquest or chatting with other people for 18 hours or more a day. I got to sit in his room and watch TV while he did this. Often at night we would have sex and then he would get up and go back to his computer. Eventually he mumbled something about how he could tell that I needed to rest, and so his being online all day was to help me get rest. He thought I must need a lot of rest because I worked full time and went to school full time, and since he couldn\u2019t do those things, I must be exhausted. \n\nWhen it was time to eat he \u201cborrowed\u201d money from his mom to take me out to crappy chain restaurants. He did this every single day I was there, for a week, costing her probably a couple of hundred dollars. He leeched off her without any remorse. She would ask him to buy her something off of Amazon and he would sneak video games and anime DVDs onto her card and tell me about how clever he was. A year later, when we moved in together (oh god why did I do this??) he would do the same thing to me, and more. All while thinking of himself as the perfect, considerate son and boyfriend. \n\nOne night during my first or second visit we were going to see a movie, and he was trying to print the tickets out ahead of time (this was like 2003 or so). He was having a hard time getting the printer to work, and suddenly started yelling at the printer \u201cTake it, bitch! Take it you bitch!\u201d At first I kind of laughed because I thought he was joking, but he was seriously having a tantrum and that\u2019s what he thought was appropriate to yell. Wtf. It didn\u2019t fit his sweet and innocent persona at all. \n\nWhen we lived together, he still \u201ccouldn\u2019t\u201d work or go to school. His mom would send him money to help with living expenses and he would immediately ask me to drive him to Best Buy so he could spend it on himself. He never gave me one cent for the fucking groceries or rent. He was happy being completely dependent on his mom and on me. He took me for granted big time and expected unconditional love in return. When he talked about the future, it was always about him being a stay at home dad to our future kids (thank god we didn\u2019t have kids!) while I would go to work like a slave. \n\nHe would cry like a baby when things didn\u2019t go his way. I had so much sympathy for his crying for a while, and then I realized how manipulative it was. Like a child, he cried to force me to comfort him. One time after sex he started crying and demanding to know if my past boyfriend had a bigger dick than his. He wouldn\u2019t stop crying until I assured him that he had a big dick. Ugh. \n\nEventually I got sick of taking care of a 23 year old giant baby. I found someone else and he did not take it well. I\u2019m sure I could have broken up with him more gracefully than I did, but I had been taken advantage of for a couple of years at this point. Within a year of us breaking up, he was suddenly driving, going to college again, and living on his own. He even went on to go to graduate school and now has a great job and fully supports himself. It was 13 years ago and he still plays up how much I wounded him by \u201cthrowing him away.\u201d He has zero ability to see my perspective on the situation, in his mind he was a sweet innocent child and I am a bitch who withdrew my \u201clove\u201d for no good reason. He can\u2019t see how unfair it was for him to expect me to always put him first and be a 24/7 caregiver to a fully functional adult human. \n\nA few months before I left him, I was excitedly preparing to travel to Mexico for a week for school. I had never done anything like that before and I was really looking forward to it... only to have him say to me, sadly, \u201cWhat about ME? What will I do for that week?\u201d It was one week, and he couldn\u2019t he happy for me because I was going to do something without him. \n\nI know that my going along with him and dating him says a lot about me, too. I had untreated CPTSD back then. The guy I left him for was actually a thousand times worse, and we were married for almost 10 years. I\u2019ve learned so much from these shitty narcs.\n\nEdit: This guy actually tried hoovering me fairly recently, after we didn\u2019t speak for years. 2 years ago or so while I was going through a really bad time with my mental health, he started sending me his patented long flowery emails. The same self-congratulatory, look how smart I am writing style from when we were dating. Pointedly ignoring anything that I said in my replies about the guy I am seeing. One day I made an Instagram post about getting a new job and he started asking me about it over DM, and it was so...weird. He was absolutely grilling me about the job, sending question after question: how much do you make, how far is it from your house, how many hours a week will you work, etc, like a ton of questions about it. Things that should only really matter to me and my current partner. It weirded me out so much that I blocked him!", "subreddit": "NarcissisticAbuse"}

We'll call him Hex, for Healthy Ex.  It was a real eye-opener and I wanted to share a story that gave me a lot of clarity on whether my Nex acted with intention when he hurt me, which is a concern that I think a lot of us have.\n\nThings didn't work out between Hex and me and we broke up after about three months.  It was a healthy breakup, which was its own revelation.  We respected each other's feelings, cried a lot, decided we'd like to still be friends and made a plan to take two months apart then catch back up as friends afterwards.  We've been consistent about sticking to that plan and we both trust each other to not goad romantic feelings inappropriately going forward.  It's the type of nuance and mutual respect I could never dream of pulling off successfully with my Nex.\n\nBefore we broke up, though, there were a few hard weeks where I realized that I couldn't date someone casually for longer than a couple of months and that I needed to decide how I felt about him as a long-term match -- which was difficult and stressful, since my feelings were still mostly an opaque minefield of triggers as a result of healing from N trauma.  (Hex knew the full story about my history / where I was at in healing, but I still feel guilty for having dated again too soon -- I'm taking at least a few more months to myself from here before trying again.)  Ultimately, I felt like we ended up not having much in common interests-wise, despite him being amazingly kind / talented / attractive and treating me well -- we always wanted to do different things on weekends, hang out with different types of people, watch different things; at the same time, personality-wise we had a lot of the same strengths and weaknesses, which made me feel very understood but not very complemented (e.g. we were terribly awkward at parties, both of us having social anxiety and not having many common interests to talk about).  He had an abuse history as well, and the fact that we bonded over that made our relationship feel more like therapy than romance a lot of the time.\n\nSO, the point of this post.  I decided that I wanted to break up and asked if we could meet up to talk soon.  He said one of his best friends, who he hadn't seen in years, was in town that week and he wanted me to meet him.  I had a panicky moment, because there was no way I was going to spend a day getting to know his best friend just to break up with him afterwards.  I couldn't make an excuse to dodge it since he already knew I was free, and I wanted him to be emotionally prepared for the breakup instead of blindsided, so I told him that I'd rather just the two of us meet up to talk.\n\nHe responded with, \"Wait, is this like a 'we need to talk?'\"\n\nI had knots in my stomach.  'Fuck, what was I thinking, this is practically breaking up over text, fuck, I can't do that to him!'\n\nSo I told him that it wasn't a \"we need to talk,\" just that I wasn't comfortable meeting his friend yet and had a few things I'd been meaning to talk about.  I felt like scum for lying, but I didn't want to break up over text and I didn't want to ruin his visit with his friend.\n\nHe responded with a message that broke my heart.  \"Okay, thanks for explaining!  Sorry, I got really anxious there.  I know that's not what was happening, I just can't help but to get in my head about this kind of thing.  We can talk all about that when we talk and I'll try to work on being more trusting!\"\n\nThat's the message that this post is about.  I think we've probably all sent a message like that at some point.  You can clearly see in it that his head is turning away from being suspicious of me and towards being critical of himself.  It's transparent.  I felt awful reading that text.  It's painful to read, it's painful to remember.\n\nI texted him back immediately to say, \"No no no no no, I'm being weird right now and it's absolutely natural to feel anxious about that, please don't beat yourself up!\"  When we got together the first thing I said was that he was right, this was a \"we need to talk\" conversation and that I was deeply sorry to have lied about it, that I just didn't know how else to handle the situation and that I hated that I provoked anxiety and breached trust.  He said he was glad to have had the time with his friend and that it would've been worse if I'd handled it any other way.\n\nI still don't feel GOOD about any of this, but what I realized afterwards is that I was trying my best throughout to act with consistency and respect, to honor his feelings and to avoid hurting him.  During those days between the text exchange and the breakup I could barely think about anything else, it was just blind, dense guilt and worry.\n\nWhat I realized afterwards is that my Nex saw me blaming myself the way my Hex did in that text.  And he ENJOYED it.  If my Nex had gotten that text, he would've said, \"It's okay Jay, I can forgive you. I'm glad you're working on it.\"\n\nI went back and forth for so long on whether my Nex realized what he was doing to me, but having been on the receiving end of a text like that one, it's just blatantly obvious what's happening when it's happening.  There's no way you could miss it or misinterpret it.\n\nI think about how much I admired my Hex in that moment -- how kind I thought he was, how strong, how much I respected the trust he was displaying.  And I think about how my Nex must have seen me -- weak, pathetic, like clay that he'd worked into the exact position he wanted, like a block teetering on a ledge that he couldn't wait to topple.  I was racked with guilt and remorse to see my Hex exhibiting self-blame even once; my Nex spent months actively pushing me into that loop.  I can't even imagine the level of heartlessness and evil required to do such a thing.\n\nThis wasn't an easy story for me to share, but hopefully it can give some of you some perspective.  For me, one takeaway is that YOU ARE NOT THE NARC.  You wouldn't be able to miss it if you'd consistently provoked these feelings in someone.  The other is that what narcs do is intentional.  They can absolutely see what they're doing, and they do it repeatedly, for fun.", "subreddit": "NarcissisticAbuse"}

cousin cried in another room, nobody defended him; Dad brags and laughs about it monthly ever since.\n\n**December 25, 1976:** Dad slapped Monica full force at 4 years old in front of 20 people, she had asked \u201cis this all the presents I get?\u201d. Apparently, she was the only greedy toddler in world history. Dad has bragged about this one monthly ever since as well.\n\n**October 14, 1985:** We move across the country for Dad\u2019s new job, against the will of all five of us. Eight year old I am saying goodbye to my childhood friend, and Dad announces to everyone that I\u2019m \u201clazy and out to lunch\u201d.\n\n**May 22, 1986:** Dad humiliates Monica regarding the national anthem at a baseball game. \u201cAnthem\u201d is the word she misspelled at the fifth grade spelling bee in November 1982. \u201cLook, Monica they\u2019re playing the national a-n-t-h-E-m, not U, E!\u201d.\n\n**February 26, 1987:** My maternal grandfather had passed away about 36 hours earlier, and I was humiliated in front of 20 people in my grandma\u2019s living room. Four months earlier as a fourth grader, I had tried cooking an egg in the pan in the microwave, not knowing that cause sparks. Mom brought up the four month old incident, called me \u201cChef Boyardee\u201d in front of people we hadn\u2019t seen in years. Nobody laughed except for Monica and her facepalming. Mom never humiliated her other three children in front of 20 people, so why me? My grandpa was a bully, and I suspect my mother wasn\u2019t all that upset about his demise.\n\n**May 20, 1987:** Basketball in the driveway against the kid three years older and two feet taller. I drive to the basket and my shot is swatted away like a mosquito at a family picnic. Dad and Monica laugh hysterically, and Monica says \u201che won\u2019t do that again.\u201d Dad ponders the next five years why I am not aggressive enough on the basketball court. I did make it to the final 24 out of 124 players for the eighth grade team on November 9, 1990. Several classmates remark that I\u2019m a far better player when my father is not in attendance.\n\n**July 27, 1988:** Dad teases 14 year old Rachel about her acne for days, and she finally snaps to shut up about it. He spins her around, throws her up against the bunk bed and her head snaps back; \u201cDid you have hot dogs today? We all know nitrates turn you into a real bitch!\u201d I\u2019m 11 and I\u2019m next if I defend her. \u201cNobody tell your mother about this.\u201d\n\n**December 6, 1988:** My first organized basketball game. I dribble the ball off my left foot with 30 seconds remaining in a tie game, and we lose by two. Cue Monica lecturing how \u201chumiliating it must be to lose the game for your team.\u201d The radio is off so I know my parents heard this. Self-confidence problems in sports continue for years.\n\n**June 26, 1989:** The girl across the street told 9 year old Phoebe about an awesome museum, which turned out to be a disappointment. Phoebe pouts for hours, Dad slaps her to knock it off as dozens of tourists are walking by. She\u2019s in a better mood 30 minutes later. Dad always wins.\n\n**June 27, 1989:** Phoebe (recently completed fourth grade) humiliated me on vacation by telling everyone that I had asked Julie to dance two months earlier, and was rejected. The truth is, I had chickened out on asking Julie, thanks to severely low self-esteem (wonder why?), not your normal middle school jitters like people thought. Mom and Dad just sat there in the van, and Monica whispered \u201cIt\u2019s true isn\u2019t it?\u201d. Not the most mature response for a 17 year old girl.\n\n**August 8, 1990:** Monica is about to go off to college, and has been generally anxious and bitchy all summer. Dad has had enough, puts both his hands around her throat, and shoves her head up against the kitchen cupboard four times at full force. I\u2019m 13 and just stand there or else I\u2019m next. Mom comes home from work, Monica is bawling with a massive headache, \u201cYou know your dad has a temper\u201d.\n\n**March 16, 1991:** Dad yelled at Phoebe at 11 years old at the movies because she didn\u2019t want to see that film and wanted to stay home. Forced her to go anyway and the Silent Treatment towards each other prevails for months. Saturday night is ruined, and Dad just HAS to win.\n\n**July 17, 1991:** College freshman Monica shoves my eighth grade feet aside on the cooler in the van on vacation. I do the same in return, and she violently kicks me resulting in purple golf ball on the outside of my left ankle. Mom says we \u201cneed to try harder to get along\u201d. I have trouble walking for two weeks, but I\u2019m \u201cmilking it\u201d.\n\n**September 14, 1991:** I am grilled with 11 questions about my diet since Friday morning at a Saturday morning overnight cross country meet. What I ate wasn\u2019t good enough, and I told my coach if Dad apologizes, my running career will continue. No apology ever comes, and my last cross country meet is on October 19, 1991. I loved cross country with a passion. We had 87 male runners, and I was 11th best on the team as a freshman, not good enough apparently.\n\n**January 12, 1992:** We all ride five hours to watch Monica compete in her college sport. Phoebe is bawling on Sunday night (picked on in seventh grade), can we PLEASE spend the night and miss school on Monday. Dad says we need to get back, and I said \u201ckarma bitch!\u201d regarding the remarks from June 1989 above. Phoebe is screaming at me, and Mom tells me to stop provoking her; no comments about the behavior from almost three years ago, and I tell her so. Mom sighs to just be quiet and let\u2019s go home.\n\n**February 4, 1992:** Phoebe blows up at Dad \u201cso you think I\u2019m faking\u201d being sick; the only person who mentioned faking is Phoebe. This was followed by two months of silent treatment to each other.\n\n**August 18, 1992:** My contact lens rips in half on vacation. I ask from the back of the van if anyone has tissue, solution, anything at all. Nobody answers me, then 20 year old Monica and 13 year old Phoebe snicker. I\u2019m quiet for the next 400 miles all the way home. I just don\u2019t matter.\n\n**April 8, 1993:** I was reaching for a cassette on the floor of my car, took my eyes off the road, and 16 year old me crashed into a brick mailbox, totaling my dad\u2019s ten year old Chevrolet. Phoebe announces this the next day at Monica\u2019s competition. Monica facepalms, everyone stares at me, and I leave the dinner table crying. I had whiplash for a month, and I was charged with an improper lane change. It was removed from my record 365 days later because of no further violations, and my mentor/academic coach wrote the judge a letter of recommendation. It used to be brought up yearly by one of my sadistic relatives, but I put a stop to it in the Nineties. We haven\u2019t discussed it since.\n\n**January 17, 1994:** I accidentally left behind a bag of toiletries in my hotel room for an academic competition. For two hours one way, my dad lectures me on being more careful, etc. because he had business in that same city and I had Martin Luther King Day off from school. I offered to pay the postage to send it home, but he obviously preferred the lecture. Monica was home for Spring Break two months later, and he told her the story, and she facepalmed. I asked why she wasn\u2019t at Daytona Beach with some friends, and then \u201cOh that\u2019s right, you don\u2019t have any friends\u201d. Mom told me to apologize to Monica, and I refused. The last thing I heard leaving the room was Monica asking \u201cwhy is he so disrespectful to me?\u201d.\n\n**July 13, 1994:** Monica and Phoebe force feed me twelve pairs of sunglasses to try on while on vacation. Try these, try these, and try these. I walk away, which is followed by \u201cdon\u2019t ignore me asshole\u201d in front of a dozen customers. Mom says \u201cthey\u2019re talking to you\u201d and Dad says \u201ctough to blame him for ignoring the two of you.\u201d Then I, at the age of 17, bought my own fucking sunglasses without their help later that day. \u201cHe\u2019s so stubborn, what an asshole.\u201d\n\n**December 22, 1994:** Julie (1989 crush from above) and I are on our sixth date. She dumps me in my driveway. I\u2019m not heartbroken, and we\u2019re still friends years later. Monica asks me the next day at the dinner table \u201cwhat were you two doing last night in the driveway for so long?\u201d in front of everybody. So I looked down at my food, and said \u201cI was getting dumped\u201d. So Monica started pointing and laughing at me. My parents pressed for details, I refused, and they never said a word to Monica about her behavior. Monica was 23, and still four years away from her first date.\n\n**June 14, 1995:** I\u2019m at a national academic competition near Monica\u2019s college, so she and Phoebe tag along (just what I was hoping for). I bought a giant bag of candy at the hotel to distribute to teammates, friends, opponents, chaperones, etc. Monica and Phoebe chastise me in front of everyone:** \u201cAsshole\u201d, \u201cYeah really\u201d, \u201cyou were going to eat all of that by yourself\u201d, \u201cyeah right\u2026give it to everybody else\u201d, \u201csure you were, loser\u201d. Nobody in attendance defended me. I cried recounting the story to my parents when I got home, but they said to let it go.\n\n**August 12, 1995:** Leave for college for freshman year at Family Jock School. Cried myself to sleep because I don\u2019t want to go, but maybe I can solve my awful relationship with Monica. Dad insists that having an off campus apartment and living with her and having no friends is better than fighting with a total stranger and having lots of friends. This is all a charade to pretend we have a great family. My major is chosen for me, and Monica opens an account (VP tells me that she illegally monitors, I refuse to press charges) in my name because she is a bank teller. I have now had no say in my school, my job, my major, my housing, or even my bank. I press on because we\u2019re a \u201cclose family\u201d.\n\n**August 15, 1995:** Monica reveals that I am living with her and attending Family Jock School not Ivy League Dream School because Mom and Dad don\u2019t love me; I somehow always knew but I\u2019m upset anyway. This happens right after I\u2019m fully unpacked.\n\n**Fall 1995 through Summer 1997:** Monica found me a job at the family jock school that I never wanted that I struggled with for 2 years; I was yelled at dozens of times by an abusive boss (her friend) right in front of her, she told me \u201cyou need to pay attention and do better\u201d. I\u2019ve had trouble leaving abusive relationships my whole life.\n\n**November 3, 1995:** Falsely accused of stealing a radio at awful job above, exonerated, no apology. Suicidal thoughts so I head to the University Medical Center for Trip #1.\n\n**November 23, 1995:** Monica announced at Thanksgiving that I stole a radio. My dad talks to my boss\u2019s boss in person a couple weeks later; boss\u2019s boss says \u201cMonica is such a bitch because that isn\u2019t true\u201d and walks away. I spend the rest of Thanksgiving Weekend in my childhood bedroom, mostly crying. But I was defended in December when my dad picked me up after Finals.\n\n**November 27, 1995:** Suicidal thoughts so I head to the University Medical Center for Trip #2.\n\n**February 1, 1996:** Recent birthday with no acknowledgement, so suicidal thoughts. I head to the University Medical Center for Trip #3.\n\n**August 31, 1996:** Monica insisted that I walk a mile past a football stadium to meet up with the family before the game; I asked to be picked up or to meet AT THE STADIUM and she said \u201cbe at the McDonald\u2019s\u201d 16 times in the next 60 seconds and wouldn\u2019t let me talk. Silent Treatment from Monica and snickers from Dad all weekend. \u201cSon, she\u2019s in charge, there\u2019s nothing we can do about it.\u201d\n\n**September 4, 1996:** Suicidal thoughts so I head to the University Medical Center for Trip #4.\n\n**February 3, 1997:** Recent birthday with no acknowledgement, so suicidal thoughts. I head to the University Medical Center for Trip #5.\n\n**November 22, 1997:** Monica meets up with Phoebe and my former coworker, who all acknowledge I am \u201cthe family loser\u201d (Phoebe tells the story a few days later). I suspected that was my nickname behind my back, and now I have proof.\n\n**November 30, 1997:** Bawling in my childhood house because of Phoebe\u2019s revelation from abusive colleagues I thought were out of my life. Freshman Phoebe drives me back to the dorm, I\u2019m bawling the entire way.\n\n**December 2, 1997:** Suicidal thoughts. I head to the University Medical Center for Trip #6.\n\n**May 10, 1998:** Monica spends the entire summer trying to break up Phoebe\u2019s relationship with Mike (a guy Monica had known for a long while who never made a move on her); intentionally spread a false rumor that Mike was a child molester for dating someone younger; Mike is 31 and Phoebe is 18. I was there when Monica said that about Mike, and 30 people are horrified at the restaurant because it\u2019s an engagement party (for people I didn\u2019t know, I was just there because Monica said there\u2019d be extra food).\n\n**August 6, 1998:** Stuck in traffic in downtown Chicago on a Friday afternoon because I \u201chave terrible map skills\u201d; said \u201ccan I see the map please?\u201d 17 times in the next 25 minutes before Dad asked her to stop; insisted on pulling over at 5:**30 on vacation so that I wouldn\u2019t get to see my girlfriend the next day; Monica said she didn\u2019t feel well but Dad insisted we keep going. Mom is puzzled by Monica\u2019s vague symptoms.\n\n**August 25, 1998:** Phoebe\u2019s boyfriend Mike calls me and says he\u2019s \u201chad enough\u201d because Phoebe just gave him a 15 minute lecture about the \u201ccorrect\u201d way to cook mac &amp; cheese \u201cskim milk dumbass\u201d; they break up two months later. Monica is over the moon because \u201cI warned Mike that Phoebe is an awful human being\u201d.\n\n**September 4, 1998:** Monica took me five hours to see my girlfriend on Labor Day weekend and intentionally went through downtown to delay me an hour.\n\n**November 1, 1998:** Monica goes on her first date; two months shy of turning 27.\n\n**November 23, 1998:** College girlfriend dumps me, and I\u2019m puzzled beyond belief. I found out later she had been fucking an ex during our entire relationship. Worst Thanksgiving ever.\n\n**November 30, 1998:** Suicidal thoughts. I head to the University Medical Center for Trip #7.\n\n**December 21, 1998:** Ex emails me that she\u2019s sorry and wants to get back together. I show up at her work (where we met) to talk about that, and she calls the police. I produce the email, and the cop tells her to not contact me again.\n\n**December 24, 1998:** I find out about my ex cheating from her ex on America Online. It\u2019s 5am on Christmas Eve so I went to bed. 36 hours later, my dad tells me I\u2019ve been \u201cmoping and need to get over it\u201d. Merry Christmas to all.\n\n**February 7, 1999:** Monica took me to a concert as a birthday gift, said that I must be cheap because I thanked her verbally instead of taking her to a concert with a $38 ticket. I make $7 an hour at a new job (non-abusive boss though). Monica\u2019s now husband tells Rachel he was dreading meeting me, so the concert was a setup from the start.\n\n**February 27, 1999:** I was the only one not dating someone; Monica asked me \u201cis your hand tired?\u201d in front of about 20 people (roommates, siblings, parents, friends, etc.).\n\n**May 1, 1999:** College roommate\u2019s ex-girlfriend calls me a loser (due to my depression and social isolation) on my college graduation day in front of about 50 people. Everyone laughs, and I walk across the stage anyway because I\u2019m a pussy. I receive a letter the next week that I still have one more class to go, and I won\u2019t be graduating until August. The dean says I \u201cfell through the cracks\u201d. My relatives to this day think my severe depression that semester was due to my college girlfriend.\n\n**July 17, 1999:** My college ex shows up at Julie\u2019s (girl I dated from 1994 above) wedding (the college ex knew the wedding date and location because Julie got engaged while we were dating). I call the cops, then talk to her anyway while waiting for them. The cops show up, tell her to stay away from me, and I refuse to press charges.\n\n**August 6, 1999:** My actual graduation day, but we head out of town. Phoebe humiliates me on vacation in the car in front of Mom and Dad for having a CD collection not female enough to suit her. Phoebe got mad and told me to \u201cshut up\u201d when I named female CDs that I owned; this one was my fault because why was a 20 year old man on vacation with three such toxic people?\n\n**August 13, 1999:** The entire family is heading to my ex\u2019s place of work; I refuse to go because the cops said not to go. My family doesn\u2019t know this, because I don\u2019t trust any of them. Phoebe says \u201cOh, GET OVER IT!\u201d in front of all those people and Dad says \u201cYeah, really son!\u201d. To this day, they still don\u2019t know the truth.\n\n**October 25, 1999:** I come home from my first job out of college, still wearing my necktie; \u201cwhy don\u2019t you take your tie off?\u201d for the 50th workday in a row; I change into a T-shirt and sweats, still wearing the necktie; Dad tells me I\u2019m disrespectful.\n\n**November 25, 1999:** I refuse to go to a local tourist attraction with the family, and you can understand why. Phoebe calls me \u201ca loser\u201d, Monica calls me \u201can antisocial asshole\u201d, and nobody defends me. Thanksgiving is my favorite day.\n\n**January 7, 2000:** I walk in on my ex riding her ex on her living room couch. She and I had agreed to be monogamous a week earlier. I had surprised her with flowers and candy on her off day as a nurse. Lock the door, you idiots.\n\n**March 6, 2000:** Girlfriend of a month confesses to me that she cheated on me with her neighbor. I had suspected something earlier, and she said I was crazy.\n\n**December 8, 2000:** Girlfriend of eighth months confesses to me that she cheated on me with her best friend\u2019s ex-boyfriend, but she wants to work things out with me. I tell her to pay the bill, and then I walk out to my car and drive away. If only Dad knew that her parents were born in Taiwan. He\u2019d never speak to me again.\n\n**December 24, 2000:** Monica accuses me of driving all four of my exes to cheat on me. She mentions this during the gift exchange to nobody\u2019s interest but mine.\n\n**March 3, 2001:** Suicide thoughts. Hospital trip #8 via sleeping pills; I woke up in a cold sweat and drove myself to the hospital; I went to rehab where I was surrounded by people who had lost their homes, their marriages, millions of dollars combined. I told the counselor I\u2019ve been scared straight. I haven\u2019t taken sleeping pills since.\n\n**November 5, 2001:** First date with my now wife Janice.\n\n**November 22, 2001:** Monica and Phoebe get in a huge fight at Thanksgiving because they both think the other puts me down too much. Rachel and I haven\u2019t laughed so hard in years. Monica and Phoebe don\u2019t speak until Phoebe is a bridesmaid in Monica\u2019s wedding a year later. On a side note, I think Monica has trouble making friends.\n\n**February 11, 2002:** A lawyer in a different county called me that my identity had been stolen. I was falsely arrested the next day at my financial analyst job for not returning a moving truck that someone had rented in my name. Mom lectured me (\u201cUh hello???\u201d), after paying the bail of course. The guy was charged with eight counts of forgery, and I successfully sued the moving company for negligence. The checkbook and the signature were too completely different last names. My mom is comfortable bitching at her sister, at my sister Rachel, and at me; nobody else.\n\n**June 12, 2002:** My dad and I get in an argument regarding Janice and I moving 200 miles away for school (my masters and her bachelors). I don\u2019t want him \u201chelping\u201d us move because he takes over instead of helping. Getting my masters is my opportunity to shed the demons of The Family Jock School. Janice and I have pleasant memories of going to school there.\n\n**August 3, 2002:** Dad is bossy and complains we are all moving too slow like I knew he would. I let it go.\n\n**September 20, 2002:** I started shaving my head when I was 25 because I was losing my hair; Monica told me it looked awful. At her bachelorette party (one friend from high school and my now wife), Monica tells my now wife that \u201cChandler has always hated me\u201d. I let it go.\n\n**October 5, 2002:** \u201cCheerleaders are a waste of human flesh\u201d very loud from my dad at my graduate school\u2019s football game; dozens of people turn around and glare at him; he rubs it in every 30 minutes all day because we had walked 100 yards, and I had to go back to the apartment to get the tickets.\n\n**November 16, 2002:** Monica is bossy all weekend for her wedding, especially towards me. I let it go.\n\n**September 18, 2003:** Phoebe is in my graduate school city on business. We meet up for dinner, and it is one putdown after another all night. I let it go.\n\n**November 23, 2003:** Dad is doubled over in his recliner laughing at my wife\u2019s family and their backwards logistics for my wife\u2019s birthday party. It involves driving 20 miles past the restaurant to their house and then coming back to get my wife instead of just meeting at the restaurant. It is humiliating, and I let it go.\n\n**December 12, 2003:** I get my masters even though I should have refused to walk across the stage due to so much up above. I get a speeding ticket after my graduation dinner, and Mom announces from the back seat that Dad and I both need to slow down.\n\n**March 5, 2004:** Phoebe humiliates me as I watch my favorite NBA team down at the end of the third quarter. \u201cDo we HAVE to watch this, loser???\u201d, so I change the channel so she\u2019ll shut up. This becomes relevant in a few years.\n\n**August 14, 2004:** Mom humiliates my Dad on vacation with the \u201cproper\u201d way to load batteries into the camera. Nobody else was there.\n\n**August 28, 2004:** I accidentally reveal to Rachel that Mom has breast cancer; everyone knew but bawling Rachel, who \u201cnow has evidence\u201d that\u2019s she\u2019s not part of the family. Phoebe is horrified when I accidentally spilled the beans *hands on her face Home Alone style* (\u201cOh my god oh my god oh my god you dumb fucking loser\u201d). I\u2019m no saint because I shove her out of the computer chair on to the floor, and punch her in the head four times.\n\n**December 24, 2004:** Monica humiliates middle sister Rachel with FIVE suggestions of \u201cI can see up your kilt\u201d (the first four were ignored because Rachel and her Scottish husband like to dress up in kilts for special occasions). Monica pretended to be the victim and sulked when middle sister Rachel (we are very close) snapped at her to shut up about the kilt. Monica was furious when I told her that she should have curtailed the kilt comments because it's Christmas Eve. Phoebe gives dirty looks to me and to Rachel all night. Rachel cries the rest of the gift exchange, and Monica gives me the silent treatment for two years.\n\n**March 6, 2005:** Mom asked me 17 questions about my diet, and I humored her and answered them anyway. \u201cYou aren\u2019t drinking enough milk\u201d she says after my doctor said I\u2019m at risk for a second kidney stone. The doctor says I should have cheese occasionally, milk never, and take calcium vitamins. It\u2019s humiliating to be interrogated by someone who\u2019s not a doctor, followed by being chastised for doing what\u2019s best for my health.\n\n**May 7, 2005:** I called Phoebe (I don\u2019t know the fuck why) to tell her Janice and I are engaged. She asks if I called Monica. I changed the subject to not give her the satisfaction. Dick move by Phoebe.\n\n**December 10, 2005:** Dad tells Monica over the phone (while I\u2019m there): \u201cYou treat your brother like a child, and he\u2019s tired of it.\u201d Monica gives him the silent treatment for weeks.\n\n**April 22, 2006:** My Wedding day. Dad humiliates my groomsman\u2019s wife regarding my transportation to the wedding. I take her out to dinner a couple weeks later as an apology. Monica, Phoebe, Mom, Dad all make passive aggressive comments all weekend, but nobody responds. Mom told me to make nice with Monica during the Mother/Groom dance, knowing that I wouldn\u2019t make a scene. Dick move by Mom.\n\n**December 23, 2006:** I call Monica to bury the hatchet; through tears she says, \u201cMy heart is ALWAYS in the right place\u201d. I laugh and she hangs up.\n\n**November 22, 2007:** Go back to March 5, 2004. The football game is a blowout, so I change the channel. Phoebe abusively says that Rachel\u2019s husband is watching that. I get up and leave, and then I stay away from Phoebe for months. My parents have Christmas without me and Janice.\n\n**March 2, 2008:** Mom and Janice are done shopping, and waiting outside the store. My dad is in the front seat with me. My mom is 5-10, and my wife is 5-6. My dad says \u201clet\u2019s pretend they\u2019re prostitutes\u2026.how much for the tall one and how much for the fat one?\u201d. I drive the four of us home in silence, and my parents leave. My mom and my wife both want to know why I\u2019m so quiet. So I tell them, and my wife and my mom both say to let it go.\n\n**May 11, 2008:** Janice and I pay for a Mother\u2019s Day day trip for our mothers. The entire day is Dad criticizing my high school mentor for being a loser (because the mentor tells me not to put up with the abuse); mentor is the closest thing I\u2019ve ever had to a father. Dad criticizes my driving, the restaurant, the tourist attraction itself, the entire day is ruined. He closes the day by saying \u201cPhoebe didn\u2019t do anything wrong at Thanksgiving\u201d. I don\u2019t speak to my Dad until Christmas. I see Phoebe at Christmas, but I don\u2019t apologize.\n\n**October 19, 2008:** My father tells my wife over the phone regarding the March 2nd comments from seven months earlier: \u201cYou have to understand, my mother didn\u2019t love me, and I had to pay back her social security debts.\u201d\n\n**January 11, 2009:** Mom sends me a long email that says \u201cyou seem too busy for us\u201d somewhere in the middle.\n\n**May 25, 2009:** The last time I have spoken with Monica and Phoebe; no particular reason.\n\n**May 1, 2010:** My mom\u2019s retirement party at Phoebe\u2019s condo. Janice and I do not attend.\n\n**July 28, 2010:** Janice has breast cancer.\n\n**September 17, 2010:** Janice has her lumpectomy, and I insist that I will not argue with anyone at the hospital. Mom and Dad are not there. Rachel wishes her well on Facebook, Monica and Phoebe do not.\n\n**September 22, 2010:** Therapy with a wonderful shrink named Marilyn begins.\n\n**January 29, 2011:** Janice is cancer free, and she has been ever since.\n\n**May 12, 2012:** Janice, Mom, Dad, and I have dinner for Mother\u2019s Day. I hadn\u2019t seen my parents in over two years. Things go well for a few months.\n\n**December 30, 2012:** Mom and Dad come over for Christmas gifts. I remark to my Dad that I\u2019ve never seen him wear jeans before. He remarks that \u201cyou\u2019d know that if you weren\u2019t gone for two years\u201d. I don\u2019t know why I let him in the house anyway.\n\n**December 31, 2012:** Janice is pregnant and due on September 2nd, we don\u2019t tell anyone until 16 weeks because it\u2019s high risk. I spend her entire pregnancy asking for advice from every good father I know.\n\n**August 18, 2013:** Our son Jeffrey is born at nine pounds, and he is perfect in every way.\n\n**August 16, 2014:** We have 40 people at Jeffrey\u2019s first birthday party. Dad humiliates me when he announces that \u201cyour bald head is ruining all the photos\u201d. It\u2019s hard to regard that as \u201conly teasing\u201d, given his track record.\n\n**February 24, 2015:** My monthly visits to my shrink Marilyn end. The last thing she tells me is \u201cnobody has the right to mistreat you, no matter who they are.\u201d\n\n**December 30, 2017:** I leave the room while Dad tells a story I\u2019ve heard literally 100 times. I\u2019m disrespectful apparently.\n\n**May 14, 2018:** Dad announces the only reason we stopped by for Mother\u2019s Day is it\u2019s on the way home from my in-laws.\n\n**April 19, 2019:** Things are better, we\u2019ve paid off a lot of debt, I start a new job soon, and I\u2019m scared for my future anyway. I haven\u2019t seen my parents in almost a year, and I don\u2019t feel bad about it; neither do they to my knowledge. I\u2019m at a loss for how to proceed.\n\nI know I am some kind of weirdo for remembering these 97 dates, but it's also painful to relive them roughly twice a week. It's so much negativity, so many putdowns, so much emotional abuse, so much sadistic cruelty at my expense. Rachel and Janice are very close, Janice tolerates my relatives, and they tolerate her. I have anxiety about my new job because I have had 27 employers (20 contract, 7 permanent) since graduating in 1999. Depression looks like laziness from a distance. I'm starting to believe in myself for the first time since 1995.\n\nPlease help with any advice, suggestions, directions to other subreddits, analysis.

She has a rough past but I didn't care. I accepted her and her child. She also has some mental issues but I loved her and accepted her. \n\nIt was rocky from the start. Something always seemed fishy or odd but I let it go. It was new love. We were inseparable. Then slowly she started the abuse. From all I want to do is spend time with you love bombing to making comments about me and my size (I'm a bigger guy) to flat out saying she likes this dude or dreams about that dude. At first, I would defend myself. Tell her this isn't cool. She'd manipulate me and make me feel guilty and insecure. Over time I stopped defending myself and started believing I wasn't good enough for this goddess of a woman. I thought we were in love. She said she hadn't loved in 10 years and I was special. She hasn't been intimate in 10 years and I was special. I believe it all. Then came more lies, break ups, love bombing all over again and then... you guessed it! Another break up. \n\nI then found out she cheated on me in February. I was devastated. I tried my best to pull myself together. I had surgery coming up and I needed to stay calm to make it (I was high risk). \n\nA month later (march) she calls me on her birthday and tries to make things right... and she did. For a little while. Was everything I always wanted. Was there for me through out one of the hardest times of my life, my surgery. \n\nThat lasted a month. We got in a argument about fucking video games. She is a gamer and had spent the last 4 days ignoring me. I asked her what was up with that and she snapped. Broke it off. I called her today and she let it all out. She never loved me. She has been with others. She just flat out wanted nothing to do with me. \n\nI don't get it. I gave her everything. Every penny, every emotion, ever single thing I had to offer. It was all a lie. She based our whole relationship on a lie. She knew all I wanted was a family, a wife and she played into it until she realized she wanted to play her video games. I'm so so fucking heart broken. \n\nI believe she changed. I believed we'd finally figured it out. It was all all a lie because she didn't want to seem like a 'whore' if I knew about the other guys. I wouldn't have cared! Everybody has a past! Jesus. I just wanted her and what we had but nope. \n\nMoral of the story, some people don't change. Stay strong.", "subreddit": "NarcissisticAbuse"}

{"post_id": "big5ci", "created_utc": 1556486065, "title": "I just feel like sharing one of the more evil things he did to manipulate me", "author": "Ell-O-Elling", "self_text": "You can check my history to see more of my story but the gist is almost 22 years together and one child. I figured out he was a narc at year 18. I sat him down and told him to get his shit together and change or this was over. He said \u201cCan I think about it?\u201d (This isn\u2019t the story topic still just background). Yeah, I know, I should have left then but I didn\u2019t. I gave him a chance. A few days later I asked if he thought about it and he said he would try. Of course he put in a little more effort but he also began an affair of which he still denies. I have tons of evidence of fishy behavior and interactions but no smoking gun. So things got worse even though he was working more and helping more around the house. I needed answers about this woman yet he kept lying to me about every interaction. Nothing he said made sense. His answers just created more questions. You all know what I\u2019m talking about. \n\nSo here\u2019s his evil doing:\n\nA little over a year after I sat him down and told him to put in effort or we were done, a person very close to me who I love dearly attempted suicide. It was devastating. This dear person in my life put a gun to their own head and pulled the trigger. Amazingly they didn\u2019t die. They almost did and was in the ICU for over a month. Within 3 days I was on a plane to be at their bedside. I stayed 10 days until I had no choice but to come home because of work and finances, but this person was now expected to survive, though how much brain damage was still unknown. Thankfully, this person has fully recovered with only a decrease in how fast they speak. You wouldn\u2019t even know it had happened if not for the massive scar and slow speech. \n\nHaving this happen made me realize just how unhappy I was. Life is short and so fragile and I didn\u2019t want my o my life to be miserable. I was done being treated badly. So I pushed my Nex more for answers and more effort. I was done. I wanted 100% immediately. I had waited long enough. It had been 19 and a half years at this point! Life was too short. Give me what I need or get out. \n\nMy Nex didn\u2019t like this of course so two months after this other person in my life attempts suicide my Nex claims he\u2019s suicidal and needs help. Never before and never since has this been something he\u2019s threatened. And in fact he knew a guy whose wife did commit suicide and he talked terrible about her. Now because I was still so raw from going through it so recently with this person so near and dear to me I took him very seriously. I drove him to the hospital and stayed with him while they admitted him to the psych ward. \n\nI was unable to get any info on him as we aren\u2019t married and the laws are very strict. I didn\u2019t hear from him for almost a week. During this time a nurse (or maybe a social worker or therapist I can\u2019t remember) called me to talk about him coming back here after he was released. They asked if he could even though they don\u2019t recommend them returning to the same environment but asked if there was nowhere else for him to go if he could. I told them of course but that both his aunt and his sister had offered him a room to stay in as they had extra space. We talked a bit more and then it was basically left that he would most likely go to his sister or aunts house. (I had been in contact the whole time with his aunt and she was totally fine with him going there). So when he was released about a week later he called to tell me he was ok but was staying in the homeless shelter! \n\nI felt like he was trying to get my sympathy by staying in the shelter rather than stay in the rooms offered by family. And of course I felt bad thinking that! The poor guy is feeling suicidal and I\u2019m over here thinking the worst of him! He told me he didn\u2019t want to be a burden to anyone, that he realized he had been taking advantage of me and making me carry him through life and he didn\u2019t want to be that to anyone else. How noble, right? I felt terrible but I didn\u2019t offer to let him come home. He needed to grow up! Giving in wouldn\u2019t have been good for either of us. Plus, I was seriously over his shit. I had put up with way too much! \n\nAt this time his Mom had been admitted to the hospital for some serious issues and she was very sick so after talking on the phone he was walking back to the hospital to see her. He calls me later that night to tell me he was going to be staying at his Moms house and helping his stepfather around the house and with the dogs since his mom was in the hospital and the stepfather had fallen and broken his ankle pretty bad the previous week. (When it rains it pours, right?!) I felt much better knowing he was staying with family and not the at the shelter. Plus he could start to regain some dignity by being useful. \n\nIt lasted two weeks before his nonsense caused a fight between me and the stepfather because I got blamed for not meeting a responsibility of which my Nex promised he would take care of. The stepfather was way out of line with how he treated me (the mother was furious and made stepfather apologize to me in person) and it caused huge problems since by this point I was done being a doormat and gave it right back but in a mature and respectable way. So my Nex came back to live with me. (I wonder now if my Nex intentionally didn\u2019t follow through to cause drama and a fight in order to get back home). Though I set a limit and told him x,y and z had to happen within a specific time frame and him living here again was contingent on that. \n\nOf course I didn\u2019t stick to it and those deadlines came and went. He did do more around the house and work more though so there was a slight improvement. However I still couldn\u2019t get answers about this other woman. It was still lies, gaslighting, manipulation and abuse. \n\nDuring one of our subsequent fights he had the nerve to blame me for the medical debt he\u2019s now in because of his stay in the psych ward as we don\u2019t have health issuance! As soon as he started blaming me I shut it down and it was the only time he tried to blame me for it. I did tell him I saw it for the manipulation it was and to not ever blame me for any of it again or he would be gone that day. He knew I was serious and he has never blamed me again. I wonder if he felt shame for it? But what fucking nerve! \n\nI can see it now as clear manipulation. Never before or since had he ever made suicidal comments or anything similar. The only comments about suicide prior to this were derogatory. He saw my reaction to this person so dear to me for their attempt and figured I\u2019d react the same to him. He knew I was done and was desperate to hold on to his toy! It makes me sick! How evil is it to do this? \n\nAs kind of a side note, I have a question for anyone who has spent time in a psych ward. Do you get a diagnosis (even just preliminary) from the doctors in the hospital? Also when they release you, is that diagnosis in any of the paperwork? I ask because my Nex told me he was diagnosed as bipolar during his stay in the psych ward. I can\u2019t see this as his diagnosis though of course I\u2019m no professional. I just know bipolar has maniac episodes and he\u2019s always been pretty even with his emotions (unless I bring up something he does wrong then he will rage). There has never been any outward show of depression or sadness. He doesn\u2019t rage out about things unless someone insulted him but he rarely gets very angry. No other instance of suicidal comments and all the paperwork he had from this time doesn\u2019t have any diagnosis, future care recommendations or anything indicating a diagnosis. When I brought him to the psych ward the nurse pulled me aside to ask what was going on. I told her I believed him to be a narc and that this was a manipulation attempt because of the person close to me attempting it and him seeing my reaction. She just took notes and then I left. He\u2019s super smart so it would be easy for him to manipulate the doctors and nurses. I just wonder why there\u2019s nothing in his paperwork indicating a diagnosis. Is that normal for a psych ward release?  \n\nIf you made it all the way to the end, thanks. I just need to vent and this sub is so helpful.", "subreddit": "NarcissisticAbuse"}

She is generally really great and caring, but she also worries about being alone.\n\nIn my life I can count on both hands how many real conversations we've had. Usually she just talks, and if I try to say anything she ignores it or pretends it isn't important and goes back to her train of thought.\n\nTo make matters worse, even though I was raised in several social environments, I never developed enough self confidence to just open up and talk. I have a physical disfigurement which turns people away, so it is very difficult to get close to anyone.\n\nI had a girlfriend in high school who thought it was cute. Mom would always hover and listen to my phone conversations with her, to the point where I was paranoid to say how I felt, because of what my mom would do.\n\nWhen I was leaving for my first date, mom stopped me as I was getting in my dad's car (I was too young to drive) and she looked me straight in the eyes and said \"Just don't have sex.\" Naturally, I didn't have a great time on the date. I was completely broken and I couldn't enjoy myself. Mom and dad divorced a couple years later.\n\nShe has intentionally publicly humiliated me on many occasions growing up until I became a hollow shell.\n\nShe has done things to undermine my confidence. For example, in high school I asked her if I could get a part time job and she said \"no, you don't want that, you'll have your whole life to work.\" This felt like she was limiting my potential, and she didn't want me to become independent.\n\nIn college I had a tough time making friends. When I called mom for support, she would say things like \"are you sure computer science is what you want to do?\" and she would push me to follow worthless degrees instead. Eventually the pain of not getting close to anyone became unbearable and I gave up, believing my working life would be no different. And I was forced to move back in with my single mom.\n\nAt this point, I was totally crushed. I looked for a job in my home town and got one quickly, but they didn't like me and laid me off in the first 6 weeks.\n\nI was able to get a work from home job and I'm making decent money. I started looking at cities to move to. A city, because it's more likely there are people who would accept me there, even if I'm not perfect.\n\nI told mom I was going to move out in the next few months. I had been living with her for several years and she was paying the bills so I was expecting her to be happy.\n\nAt first it wasn't bad. She said \"are you sure? It's going to be winter in November when you plan to move, why not wait until spring at least?\" I said I didn't want her to have to keep buying me food, internet, etc...\n\nWe kept talking and I stood my ground. I'm leaving, that's it. Then she said, \"If you're going to leave, then I should just kill myself.\" Shocked, I said something like \"what?\" She started to ramble about how her life would be meaningless without me around for her to care for. I don't remember everything because she wouldn't let me speak, she kept going and going. It was terrible.\n\nI am generally very submissive around mom because I don't want to rock the boat. She acts like it never happened. If I stay in line, she doesn't abuse me. But I fear that if I ever have a plan to leave, she'll hurt herself. I am basically forced to spend time with her when she gets home from work every day, because she needs an object to talk at. This also wastes any time I could spend on my own money making ideas.\n\nAfter this attempt to move and receiving a blow to my confidence instead of support for my fears of striking out on my own, I became very withdrawn. I find it hard to work, I only do the bare minimum and I fear I'll lose my job because I'm not really working enough to be valuable to the company.\n\nI fear making money and being successful because if I can't be independent there's no point. If making money means my mom will kill herself then my mind will not allow me to work.\n\nI don't actually believe she would do it, but she gets unstable when she thinks I'm growing emotionally. I know if I just left things would be much better but I can't get myself to work because of these emotional blocks.", "subreddit": "emotionalabuse"}

I'm not sure if my son's mom is a narc but I have a feeling she may me. \n\nI just want to run this scenario by you to see what you think. She has a tendency to do this type of thing often and it's frustrating. \n\nMy son phones me up way after he should be asleep like 11pm. I say night to him on the phone and tell him that he should be asleep by now. I hear his mom in the background and she shouts \"He's been asleep but he just woke up and wanted to phone you\". This bits fine but it's this bit that really gets to me. So the full reply goes \"He's been asleep but he just woke up and wanted to phone you, we don't want to get moaned at\". It's the moaned at bit. It's like I'm wrong for been concerned that my son's awake when he should be in bed. \n\nShe does this often but in different scenarios. I pick him up on a morning for school and if he's late to come out of the house she will say the same thing \"come on quick get in the car cause we don't want to get moaned at\" it's like I'm wrong for wanting my son to be on time so I can get him to school on time then myself to work. It really gives me a bad feeling when she does it. It actually confuses me because it feels like she's accusing me of been a bad person when I'm just wanting my son to be in bed and get to school on time. \n\nShe blames my son for everything to the point that he keeps apologising for things that he's not done. She threatens him with the police if he's misbehaving and tells him to come live with me. I think she takes substances when he stays with me and when I confront her about it she's denies it and says to me \"Are you saying I'm a bad mom?\" \n\nI'm really glad I'm away from her but I still have to communicate with her over my son and it's hard.", "subreddit": "NarcissisticAbuse"}

We live in a small city (80,000), and he's very well known across many social circles here. Some seem to know that he's garbage, but there are many who by all appearances do not. He's popular, he's charming, he can schmooze almost anyone. Of course he has very few friends, save for one or two who might be just as shady as he is. \n\nI find myself having to completely avoid social spots that he frequents (and there are many). I avoid certain grocery stores. I avoid old acquaintances. There are streets I don't drive down at all, and others I avoid at certain times of the day.

So when I met my nex, I had no idea what narcissism was and he seemed like an amazing guy at first until his crazy side started to show. Even then I did not know I was being emotionally abused and kept going through it for quite a while. And I sincerely loved him and I thought he would change so I kept giving him way too many chances and he only let me down time and again.\n\nFinally After tolerating it for over 3 years, I realised he wasn\u2019t worth it and finally cut him out of my life and I have been a lot happier ever since. Considering how much he has hurt me, I do not care about him at all and will never give him another chance. When we were together, he would always create a lot of drama, fight over stupid things, make everything always about him, disregard my opinions, intentionally do things that would hurt me, piss me off all the time \u2018cuz it seemed \u2018fun\u2019 to him, blame me for his mistakes and in spite of all his irrational behaviour, call me crazy/petty. Ever since I\u2019ve walked away from him, it\u2019s been peaceful.\n\nI wanted to block him completely from my life, but that seems like a rather difficult thing to do. We have a few common friends, and they don\u2019t know the kind of guy he really is. (He was a completely different person with me, and different with everyone else.) Also, we both work in the same profession, so sometimes we end up meeting by chance. \n\nIn any case, there\u2019s nothing he can do now to ever make me trust him again or take him back, even as a friend. So, recently I met up with some friends at an event and he happened to be there as well (somehow felt like he orchestrated the whole thing). But I didn\u2019t interact with him much but neither show him any emotion/anger and seeing me so happy somehow made him uncomfortable.\n\nSo I had blocked him on all social media and somehow forgot Instagram. And lately he has been messaging me on Instagram with the lamest excuses to text. After all that he has done, all the ways he has hurt me, I don\u2019t understand how someone can just hit u up and pretend everything is normal. But I\u2019m not showing him any emotion. usually I ignore him and even if I do reply it\u2019s not really the kind of reaction he wants or the way I used to talk to him before. And all this is making him go crazy. I\u2019ve never seen him act so desperate and pathetic. \n\nSo I just wanted to know what should I do? Should I just block him or should I let him keep trying and just ignore it? \n\nAnd sorry for the long post,", "subreddit": "NarcissisticAbuse"}

If you have another place, please tell me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI first met my NEX in freshman year of high school. He was a year above me and enjoyed a lot of the same things I did. He had a nice body and a charming and fun personality. Had. He asked me to date him when we were preparing for a party I was forced to help host because, at the time, I was his best friend. I was put into a position where I couldn't say no, and I did like him. That was the biggest mistake of my life.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLate that night was the first time he did it. I couldn't move, I couldn't think, I could just feel his cold hands on me. I wanted to cry. I wanted to ask for help. I wanted to scream. But I couldn't. He told me that I liked it. He told me that I had to because it was with him. Because it was with his \"wonderful knowledge of the female form\" (creepy, btw). I was weak. I was suffering from abandonment issues. I was self-harming. He took advantage and set himself as the most important person in my life.  I tried to break up. But then he would make me feel guilty. I would always go back to him after every fight. He had me wrapped around his finger.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhen I began to question if I was trans, he began to get mad at me. I would be researching it instead of talking to him and when he found out what I was researching, and then he claimed I wasn't trans. I tried to reason with him, but he pushed it away, claiming he knew me better then I knew me. So I had to follow. I had to agree.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe rape continued. In children's parks, at his house, at my house. I always had to agree. I always had to submit to him. I always had to help him fulfill his sick savior fantasy where he was the problem and the solution all in one. He would choke me, shove things in my mouth, and tie me up. He always did it when there was no one else around. When there was no help around.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHe started to say he didn't love me, but I loved him. And I believed that this horrible thing was love. He claimed he loved a girl that had cheated on him and was engaged. When she found out I was dating him, she sent me a message on Facebook telling me to run from him, that he didn't care about anyone. That he was dangerous. I should have listenedNEX told me lies, all the time. And I believed them. His lies ranged from him making me stuffed animals to crimes. He claimed he had killed dozens but was so good at it that no one could have found out. The terrifying thing is, I don't know if he was telling the truth or not. He insisted that it was the truth. That he was a serial killer, just like his father. He said he did hard drugs, had sex with dozens of women, and killed too many people to count.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhen I finally left him, it was messy. He insisted that he was good for me, that I wasn't going to live without him. That I would kill myself without him. He started to threaten me, telling me to remember his stories. So I had to go back with him or fear for my life. While all of this was going down, he was raping others. They came to me and I told them about how he did the same to me. Together, we told his mother and she helped us go to the police. I told them everything he had told me and had breakdowns over the fear that he would hurt me. His mother said that the stories made sense, that he had been gone when the killings he claimed happened.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHe was never found guilty of the murders. But he was found guilting of raping me and the other girls. He's in jail for life but I still fear every night that he could kill me. He could come out and get me and hurt me.I'm 17 now, almost 18. I dated him for most of the past 3 years and can't afford therapy. And I'm so scared that one day, I will end up dead.TL;DR - NEX is manipulative AF, raped me and others, denied me being trans, and said he was a serial killer.

He also broke my phone by accident during the altercation.\n\nThe full story is embarrassing. We decided we wanted to try having a threesome and invited a girl from Tinder over to see where things went. There was some ambiguity, but she knew that hooking up was on the table and that he and I were more than friends, and him and I decided to see how it went, and if nothing happened, we would at least all have fun together. She ended up leaving around 3 a.m., while I was in the bathroom. No threesome happened. Him and I were upset with how each other handled interacting with her but were poker facing it in front of her. While I was in the bathroom, I heard him talking normally to her and I didn't think he was super drunk. When I came out of the bathroom in the bedroom, he was sitting on his bed with his legs crossed waiting for me. He began yelling at me and I yelled back and we were arguing. I went to pack my bags to leave and came back in the bedroom to grab my phone charger. He grabbed me and held my arms to my body and shoved me down on the bed and then got on top of me. He held me down, and then pinned my arms under his knees and told me it would be easy for him to kill me if he wanted to, but that he's not that evil of a person.\n\nI was struggling and begging for him to get off of me as he called me names and was saying a bunch of things. Then he picked me up slightly off the bed and threw me to the ground off his bed. I hit my face and have a swollen spot/light bruise. My phone screen cracked completely and is now unusable. He continued to yell at me for about three hours. I begged and pleaded and argued with him back. He pushed his body up against me several times but made a point to hold his hands away from his body and was making comments like \"See cops, I didn't lay a hand on her!\" For reference, we are both the same height and he is about 30 pounds heavier than me. He berated me and started playing mean songs and telling me that they all were about me. He told me that he has been \"dealing with me at a level 4 brain, but level 5 brain was aware of all of my manipulation and victim playing and level six brain always had an eye on everything and wouldn't allow it anymore\". At one point he blasted music and began jumping around dancing energetically and going on a rant about how horrible I was for tricking him into dating him, and so on and so forth. That I was \\*lucky\\* that he loved me, that at least I had that going for me. At one point, I begged him to fuck me just to try to pull him back and calm him down. I\u2019m ashamed of this.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis morning he acknowledged what he did and apologized but then brushed past it very quickly and focused on what I did wrong.

I don't know how much he's been doing this, but she thinks I'm heartless and doesn't understand why I make him feel this way, meanwhile I've tried to cut as much contact as I can with him so I don't have to deal with his bullshit and constant gaslighting. I'm not super nice to him, no, and we have definitely argued in front of her which I don't like - but those are the reasons I cut off most contact with him. He hates that I set that boundary and has never accepted it, and continually tells me my decision to do it is terrible parenting and is hurting our daughter. \n\nMeanwhile he's dating a girl over ten years younger (not that there's anything wrong with that, but in this case it might explain why she puts up with him) who also acts as his nanny for our daughter whenever he's working.\n\nI feel helpless to do anything about it because unlike him I refuse to speak negatively about him to our daughter.

The change was finding out my nex was pregnant (I\u2019m not the father).  There was an initial moment of anger, in part because I had a vasectomy after we both decided we were done having children and now I realize she wasn\u2019t done, just done with me.  I felt betrayed and like my bodily autonomy was violated with a lie.  Once the initial anger of finding out about the pregnancy and the implications had worn off, I felt a tremendous weight lifted from me.  It became the moment I felt freed to begin to heal.  I was holding onto hope that she could change and I could be back with my children full time.  However, now that she is expecting another child I can step back because I don\u2019t want to come between that child and their father.  I feel like it\u2019s finally time for me to accept my loss and direct my grief towards acceptance rather than a cycle of anger.  \n\nI am reminded of the myth of Pandora.  She was given a vessel containing evil and, in her curiosity, opened the vessel which unleashed all the evils into the world.  At the bottom of the vessel, and the last to escape, was hope.  Hope is evil because it makes us persist in situations that we should abandon.  I clung to hope knowing that it was holding me back, however I felt I needed hope for the sake of my children.

That probably falls under venting, right?\n\nI was a college freshman when I met this guy. He was about 8 years older. I was at a club/bar with some friends, and he used one of the women in the group to approach me.  He's always had a cult of personality, which seems pretty normal for the narcissists I've encountered. \n\nHe really had these grandiose opinions about himself. He was the best at everything, but he often used his size to intimidate people. Because of my childhood,  my dangersense was easily overridden but for the first few weeks, I declined to meet him unless it was in public. He treated this with amusement. Like \"oh you poor thing, are you scared I'll hurt you?\"\n\nLater, some people who saw through his shit would tip me off that he was isolating me. He'd tell people I was crazy and clingy while he'd blow up my phone at all hours and get weird if it took any time for me to respond. His \"requests\" got weird.  Drive 40 minutes to see him at 3 am, to hang out with a group of friends, only to be banned from speaking, for him to brush aside physical boundaries.  \n\nI still can't say why I couldn't just put my foot down and walk away. \n \nThe moment we were alone, he tried to rape me. Held me down and only stopped when he thought someone was about to walk in. I even drove him home after. I think he said something about misreading signals. I wasn't  alone with him again. I\n took me 5 years after that to cut him off. I don't have a good excuse.\n\nSome of the stuff was just weird. Like showing up to town with a girl who was sworn to secrecy. Nevermind that I was married and not willing to have sex with him, she wasn't allowed to tell me that they were banging. Until she slipped and look shocked when I said \"yeah, I figured.  Just be careful.\" Looking back, he was still probably painting me as obsessed with him. \n\nI spoke to one of his exgirlfriends, introduced by a mutual acquaintance that wanted me to break free of him, who told me how he'd raped her. It wasn't a misunderstanding.  This was his M.O.  He liked to get them while they were young. He liked to own them. He liked abuseporn. She had to move to the West Coast to get away from him.\n\nI moved halfway across country last month and I learned recently that he was in town where I had been. Got sent a ping because he had a meltdown when I cut contact. Apparently,  he's a \"changed man\" now. Talks about feminism and how rape is bad, and how  mental illness doesn't excuse abuse. But that's the same thing he was saying when he was with his ex, when he was trying to rope me in.  Nothing has changed. He's just updated his vocabulary with the newer terms like toxic masculinity and bodily autonomy. \n\nOn one hand, I wish I could warn people, but who would believe me? On the other, I don't want him to remember that I exist.", "subreddit": "NarcissisticAbuse"}

In the last month, I have been questioning myself a lot on people's influence on me and I came to realize that he wasn't such a great influence on me.  He has very negative energy around him and I find that he really has this \"I don't care about anything or anyone\" mindset, which I first I liked but not so much anymore. He has had a tendency to break things randomly out of the blue ( but he says it's to prove the impermanence of objects and that nothing is permanent (???)). He is also quite lazy ( blame it on his meds, which can be true in part but still) and I've kind of been affected by this mindset since he always starts the day around 3 pm. His eating habits have been affecting me (he is overweight and binge eats on junk food frequently) and I have a history of eating disorder. He has this thing with honesty and while it is a value I also hold high and I like for things to be clear and open, he often makes me feel guilty when I don't say things right away- regarding how I feel about him or about what I do. He wants me to be transparent constantly, which makes me feel quite anxious as it can be challenging sometimes. He has been diagnosed with OCD and takes medication for it, but also has a history of drug abuse with opiates (which he doesn't use anymore) and now use kratom regularly.*\n\nHe has helped me moved out to my new place, helped me with music ( We are both musicians and that's how we met ), he has helped me a lot when I wasn't feeling well ( I have a history with cptsd/ being codependent), he has built stuff for me and helped me with manual work. ( even though I didn't ask him to).\n\nIn the past two weeks, I knew I needed to be alone to think about all of this and if I wanted him in my life. This is when things started getting very weird. Basically last Friday I went to see him and I had made up my mind; I thought he was too toxic and a bad influence and I wanted to break things off. When I told him, everything turned upside down. He asked me to explain why I wanted to do this. All the reasons I listed above, he either gave a reason why I saw it the wrong way or how he would work on it. He then told me how irrational and impulsive I was and he didn't think I was making logical. He said I was projecting all my issues onto him , that I felt I needed to change everything because of my own inner shit. He told me \"you should not break up with me. You are making a huge mistake. I am only helping you, all I do is for you to achieve your dreams. You are just pushing me away because you have issues within yourself and you think breaking up with me will fix it.\" After that, I kind of cracked. I starting doubting myself- my deeper self, my sense of truth, my sanity.  I really doubted myself.  We talked some more and he asked me why I just dropped this on him without a warning, without telling him we should talk, which was my mistake. He made me promise to never do this again.\n\nHe then came over to my place and spent the night. We had sex and I felt so mixed up. In the morning, I broke down. I wanted to be alone so badly, I couldn't think with him around. I started having dark ideas, like suicide or hurting myself. I felt trapped. I asked him to leave, but he said he was concerned about me. He said \" see what happens when we don't talk for 2 weeks and you isolate yourself? You get all those kind of dark and irrational ideas\". I told him I just had these thoughts now and I had been doing just fine in the past two weeks. I asked him again to leave. He said it probably wasn't a good idea because how else are we going to heal our relationship apart, especially if I get those ideas. I told him I needed to process our talk of last night alone because it was quite intense. He said he processed it then and he doesn't see why I didn't do it then too, I told him that it's just how I deal with things.\n\nHe then said okay and said he would go in a few minutes he just wanted to lay down a bit. Then I didn't know what to do, so I laid down next to him. Then we had sex again. Then he made himself breakfast and started playing guitar. I reminded him I wanted him to leave. He angrily said that he could sense that I wanted him to leave and that I didn't have to remind him. That he didn't want to rush himself to eat. Then I started cleaning my room. He left maybe 20 minutes later. After he left, I broke down. I felt I was going so insane. I felt I probably needed therapy, because how the hell can I trust myself now? Am I chaotic and put my problems on others? I texted my friend that I needed to talk and he listened to this whole story and told me he was being quite emotionally manipulative and gaslighting me.\n\nThe thing is I have had a history of dating unstable individuals/ narcissists. Am I really being manipulated? I don't want to play the victim here, I just want to have a different perspective on the matter.

I'm 25 years old. I live with my mom and a roommate. My mom is emotionally abusive. I've had bad anxiety and depression since I was a teenager. My 15yo cousin (a victim of physical/emotional abuse from his mom) was visiting. My mom used him to force me to help her out with bringing the laundry up (since I don't want to be a bad influence on him or whatever and she DID technically ask in a polite manner). I take down a couple bags of trash on my way to the car (apartment building on the second floor with only stairs). Whatever. Get back up and resume playing video games with my cousin. Turns out one of the trash bags was actually filled with my roommates weirdly heavy laundry. Oh my bad. I'll go grab it once this match is over in ten minutes. Roommate is completely fine with this. Mom FUCKING GOES OFF YELLING ABOUT HOW THIS NEEDS TO BE DONE NOW BECAUSE WHAT IF SOMEONE ELSE THROWS THEIR TRASH ON TOP OF IT YOU NEED TO GO RIGHT NOW. My mom is a big fan of giving me orders that NEED to be done IMMEDIATELY. Or trying to talk me into doing something as I am in the process of leaving to do something, usually work. Anyway I finish the match with my cousin, shaken from the yelling but I do not give in. My cousin just says to me \"hey man, I get how you feel.\" And it hits me. I'm being abused. This is not okay.\n\nI started researching. Everything I read about emotional abuse and what it does to you, what it's about, how it makes you feel. I just kept thinking \"holy fuck this is it. I thought it was just genetics.\" My dad also has anxiety/depression but he was also abused as a kid AND he did a bunch of drugs on top of it. Super nice guy. He's actually my voice of compassion for working on self-compassion.\n\nI guess I'm a little different from some in that I never \"broke\" in the sense that I never gave into her fully. I'm still SUPER fucked up, but I'm proud that I never gave up. It's like instead of having a broken back, I stood there and had the skin flayed off of my soul.\n\nMy mom has anger problems. She was emotionally abused by her narcissistic mother and the rest of my family didn't treat her all that great either. She has this perfectionistic viewpoint of the way things should be, and most of the time she lets it slide. By \"lets it slide\" of course I mean \"files away into her memory as she represses her anger so that she can verbally accost you about all of it at once when she finally reaches her unpredictable breaking point and decides that you will be the target of her wrath.\"\n\nAnyway, I told her what I realized via email. When I talked to her about it, she went into full-on deflection mode. \"No, it's just because everyone else poisoned you against me.\" So I got together my argument. And I told her. I went into detail of what she was doing and how it was affecting me. She seemed open to the idea, but still not accepting any responsibility. There's been a fair amount of back and forth, and now she seems to be in agreement with me but I'm just apprehensive. I still don't see her actually expressing a feeling of guilt at the magnitude it should be at if she really was as unaware as she claims to have been. She's going to get us a therapy session soon, but I'm doing shitty now.\n\nI had made a lot of progress on my issues over the past few years but couldn't shake them without the root cause. And now I just can't stop thinking about it. I'm getting insomnia. I had a three hour panic attack at work the other day. I could barely fold paper, barely walk at half speed. The same thought just repeated over and over in my head \"I just want to be left alone.\" That's my thought, btw. My root anxiety thought when I'm having panic attacks. It makes a lot more sense to me now.\n\nI want to move out but I can't afford to. I work full time but I'm in the SF Bay Area. I'm getting married in February so it will be a moot point then, but in the here and now my options are live with mom with a comfy bed and a kitchen or live in my prius, which I have done before but now I use marijuana to treat my mental health issues which complicates things.\n\n\"Is there anyone else you could crash with?\" Nope. I've been homeless in the past and used all of that time up. \n\nI feel like I'm simultaneously saying too much and too little. Oh also there's two months until I have health insurance again because this is a new job, so seeing someone by myself isn't an option either because money. I'm not a well-off guy. I got my GED. I've dropped out of college five times. By all accounts, I'm a fucking genius but I just panic when I try to do school. \n\nAlthough honestly I really just want to do music. Music makes me feel the opposite of how she made me feel. It makes me feel accepted. It makes me feel okay. But I have all of these emotional hangups around music that I write because of how important it is to me, how intimate it is to share it. I'm terrified of being hurt. So I've been writing music cathartically on my own for years. I have hundreds of pieces. But none of them are finished. Nothing is good enough that I would feel safe releasing it unless I hire or find instrumentalists to record my ridiculously hard to play music.\n\nI've been wanting to talk to people about it more, but I've been apprehensive about it because I don't want to make people hate my mom again. Then I remembered the internet exists.\n\nOh did I mention that at one point in the past I cut off contact with my mom? That's when I was homeless before. But it was because \"you're being a dick and it makes me feel bad.\" Which looking back I'm really wondering why I didn't realize it was emotional abuse. But whatever. That was before I knew about the anxiety/depression too. Then I converted to Christianity and forgave my mom. We still weren't living together so I rarely saw her so our relationship was fine. I'll tell you the rest of the story later maybe. It's not that important. I've gotta try to sleep. I don't really know what to expect from this but here goes.", "subreddit": "emotionalabuse"}

I mean, she can have my ex-husband, she can have the house I bought and the life I built with him, but she CAN'T have my son. The days when I don't have my son are the hardest because I know she is with my sweet boy and I absolutely hate the thought of her with my son enjoying the spoils of the life I worked so hard to build and lost to her because my ex is an asshole and she ain't the best person in the world either. I mean, we met. We knew one another. But she is just as much of a Narc as my ex - so hopefully they will destroy each other before my son is old enough to be damaged.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt has just been a roller coaster. I had a suspicion he was cheating on me with her. He would deny it. Then friends, coworkers, and people from my church would tell me that they saw them together in ways no married man should be. He still denied it. Then came out officially with her when the divorce was final. They have broken up twice now and are back together again and tend to only get back together around the holidays. First, it was Thanksgiving/Christmas, then Valentines' Day, and now Easter. And when they are together I fall to pieces. Not because I want my ex back, but because that woman is sleeping in MY bed, in MY house, and is near MY child living the life that I worked so hard for. And the thought of her with my son tears me up.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI know I should be happy that she is nice to him, but I would rather her just go away forever. I hate what both her and my ex have done to me. To my life. I know that I am better off, but that was a rough year of my life that I will never get back. They didn't have to deal with the pain of heartbreak and watching their lives fall to pieces and have to rebuild. They get to live as if it was all my fault and I am the villain. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThere are times when I am fine. But as I said, when my son is over there - I lose it. I wish they could feel the pain I have felt. I wish nothing but horrible things for them. I wish my ex-husband would just give up on my son so I could have him all the time and not have anything to do with my ex anymore. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLike, why the fuck would you want to have a child, and then when that child is six months old, abandon the family for some piece of ass and then blame it on me? I just don't get it. I am just so frustrated. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhen will this all just go away?", "subreddit": "NarcissisticAbuse"}

He was an incredibly toxic and manipulative person and this is easy for me to see now, especially thanks to subs like these detailing the red flags etc so thanks I guess. Though a big part of me feels like even if I knew all the red flags I still would've fallen for it. It was definitely a frog-in-boiling-water scenario. \n\nI repressed the rape for a long time and couldn't remember most of it, now I remember it all, all of the time and it's horrible. Sometimes I'll be walking along listening to music and I'll remember it and my knees will give in and my heart starts thudding. Typing this, I'm getting light headed. The worst part is he has hurt other girls since, one of them reported him to no avail and I've been encouraged to come forward but I just don't want to drag it all up again. Is that selfish? I also think he hurt other girls while we were friends - he used a similar tactic as he did with me - after the rape he spread this narrative that I was this psychotic and abusive girl and while we were friends he would be super into girls then turn on them in a similar way - at the time I believed him because I'm too nice (lmao) and wanted to believe he wouldn't lie about being abused. I can't shake the feeling that maybe I am just this crazy fucked in the head person who believes her own lies but I don't know any more. \n\nI don't want to think about it any more. I dropped out of the uni we both went to and moved across the country and it's all chasing me. I just want my mind and my body back. I feel like it's my fault for not realising at the time and  getting a rape k it etc then maybe he'd be locked up or at least unable to hurt anyone else. I have an amazing girlfriend who I love very much but I keep pushing her away because I don't feel worthy. I feel disgusting. The mutual friends at the time did not believe me and it just further pushed that narrative that I'm some master manipulator lying and that he's the real victim, so I stepped back.

It might be a bit long, so thanks for trying to read!This is the first time I've wrote it down... TL;DR at the bottom.\n\nOkay, so this was like 3/4 years ago now.  My mum and dad are not together, and never should have been married for the three years they were (one night stand turned into my older sister). Me and my younger brother are both by-products of rape (if I can trust what my mum said to my sister....)\n\nMum loved horses and rode in her younger years. Sister wasn't interested. Brother was only xbox orientated. I was the \"chosen one\". I spent my life running around trying to impress her. She was one of those that would forever say \"oh you're so fat you need to stop eating\" then tell others \"oh I don't know why she has no confidence!\". If I didn't make her ecstatically happy, or showed her up in some way, she branded me an animal abuser (never was) and essentially taught my siblings to fight together against me (told them I was her favourite for being into horses since they weren't). Then she got a boyfriend and decided I should do every. SINGLE. thing to do with the then SEVEN horses we had (I had technically three, which I was more than happy to care for). She'd open cards in the post addressed to us kids and steal the money out of them to feed her cigarette habit, which she lied to her new boy toy about. Us kids were only worth what she could brag about or get as much money from (i.e \"oh RoundDoughnut taught the horse everything it knows! It was in an abusive home before us!\" kinda thing). I was forced back into college which I hated so our dad wouldn't cut off child support. When she got especially angry, she'd be happy to punch or throw knives and the like at us until we were on the floor.  Wasn't allowed a boyfriend because I'd \"lose\" focus from the horses... Which meant I'd stop being her ready slave.\n\n\nAnyway, eventually I took solace on online dating (wasn't too serious) and I'd vowed to move as far as I could as soon as I could. Cue my wonderful partner. We chatted, he drove 4 hours to drive me around while mum was off glamping with the toy-boy, helping me do the immense job list I'd be left (She could be gone for 7 plus days, and we had to clear the fields of horse poop which we normally did daily).  That's a lot of poop.  He was amazing and eventually I felt comfortable enough that when he asked me to move in with him, I decided I really had nothing to lose.  Even if we didn't work out, I'd be away from her. I planned my escape in secret, bagging the bare essentials and leaving anything she might claim I'd stolen etc. and moved it during the night. Day came, I went to college as normal, bf arrived, and we swung back to the house, where we got my stuff and left. Que Texts from mum. Someone had tipped her off to me having a male in my life, and she wasn't happy. When I said that any \"talk\" she planned would never happen, we had this exchange.\n\nMum; I knew you weren't happy and wanted to move out. But come back so we can talk about this.\n\nMe; No. (I knew if I ever stepped foot back in the house with her, I'd never leave.)\n\nMum; Ungrateful slut! I'll call the police and say he's kidnapped you! Come back before I do!\n\nMe; I'm 18 and legally an adult. (I had waited specifically for me to be 18, UK based)\n\nQue bombardment of texts from siblings. \n\nBro; You're a whore and you're going to get raped and killed by the cunt you're with. More name calling.\n\nSis; Do you know how you've made mum feel? You're such a selfish cunt I hope you die. \n\n\nAnyway, eventually blocked them. Mum did call the police about three days later, lied to everyone (either I'd been taken against my will or was still with her) and when my grandparents came to visit, she took the money meant for me, and then slandered saying how I'd stolen near a \u00a31,000 worth of stuff and rent money...\n\nI don't speak to them. And I'm better for it. Mentally more stable, higher self confidence and more confidence in general, though I'm no where near fully \"healed\" with that. \n\n\nWell, no one got why I up and left at the time,  but they've all come around to tell me they've realised why, because she's an abusive piece of scum. She's scammed a lot of people out of money and many are taking her to court. I have. Thanks for reading!\n\n\nTL;DR;\n\nMum mental abusive, taught siblings to be the same. I did everything and got beat up for my troubles. Moved out against her wishes, got blackmailed and siblings saying I was a slut, should be raped, etc.  Mum told lies about me to everyone, and karma is biting her ass.\n\nMuch better, and expecting a child who will never have that same childhood.", "subreddit": "emotionalabuse"}

I lost my shit and cried like a baby that he didn't want me. What did I learn that night, when I was crying on my dad's lap? He never in his life said that.

I told her I was done with the lying and this would be her chance to come clean if she really lied about my dad. She admitted it. I told her if she wanted a relationship with me, she needed to put in the work. \n\nI was still not satisfied and decided to confront her in person. I was the bigger person and was calm the whole time. I kept pushing for the reason. What was the reason my mom lied to me and isolated me from my father?\n\nI was such a difficult child. From birth I cried so much and I wasn't affectionate enough. In her whole being I could feel she blamed me. I told her that was ridiculous, I pointed out the adults around me had the responsibility, after she asked me who I 'blamed'.

I've shown traits of PTSD and borderline and I'm close to testing as a 'normal' person in the psychological tests. Not because I'm faking it, but because I've put all my efforts into losing that paranoid, self-destructive mind. I've been bullied and isolated extensively, so her severe mental issues had become the template for my impressions and emotions for the longest time. \n\nIt's been a long journey, but I finally feel alive and in control of my mind. The world is not mean and out to get me, but a place where I experience things. Things that don't dictate all my emotions and thoughts anymore, but things I'm in charge of. I decide what I think and do as a response to my environment, not the other way around.\n\nI'm not going to always feel this way, but moments like this make up for a lot of my past. At days like this, I feel everything feels a little brighter than it does to 'normal people'. Not because I'm great, but because I dug my way out of my own hell.

You all know the story, charming and mesmerizing at first (best sex of my life!), soon turned out to be an egocentric energy vampire, constantly complaining on other people and talking about how he could do anything better than anybody, knew EVERYTHING about people and the world and him not being successful in life was society's fault. A constant self-praise. He never ever asked questions about me, not even a simple \"how was your day\". He never paid for a meal and took for granted that I did it for him. He took everything I did for him for granted and I never even received a \"thank you\". And I started to feel inadequate even though he was not doing it overtly. Still, naive me, I wanted to stick with him and show him my support and win his trust because (I thought!) I loved him and I thought he'd change once I won his heart. He started withdrawing and discarding me on the 3rd month and I luckily soon happened to see through his lack of empathy and energy draining that he was causing me and making me miserable, and realized that this story was going nowhere and I had to drop him before he would drop me or we would end in a toxic cycle. To mention: my father died while we were dating and he never showed any empathy, he even blamed me for being \"too tough\" and not signalling that the thing DID involve me (as if my cat had died!!). Also to mention: despise my father's passing I was in a good place when I first met him. I was self confident, had been doing sports for years and had discovered mindfulness one year prior. And I had already processed the fact that my father would leave soon (even though it is always tough when it happens). After having a pretty rough abusive talk where he basically did not let me speak and accused me of wanting to pressure him into having a relationship with me (??), when I confronted him on hurting me with his words and behaviour, I went no contact 3 weeks ago and blocked him on the phone and on every social media platform. I am now recovering, dealing with a kind of mini PTSD and depression. I am starting a therapy soon and I am optimistic that I am gonna have my life back in my hands.   \nMy question is, how do I deal with his ex gf? They are still friends and he always talked good abt her (at the end during the abusive final confrontations he even said he still loved her, to hurt me I guess, because he was also realizing I was about to leave him; whereas when he was trying to convince me date him at the beginning he had said he had been over her for years but still only loved her as a friend). My good friend who is also her friend (his ex's friend I mean) believes my story and also blocked him on social media. Everybody in my circle is shocked that I had to go through all this and are also very supportive. Luckily I do not have any other mutual acquaintances with him. Somehow I am obsessed over her (his ex gf) now..I keep dreaming of her and that she contacts me and understands me and we talk about him, but I think that is unrealistic as they have a good relationship with each other (who knows how the real deal is however!), but from what I see on social media and what my friend tells me (she is more friends with me than with her so she does not have many details abt their relationship) they still are in each other's life on good terms. As a pattern he is probably idealizing her now that I dropped him and that he sees she's moving on with her life. I cannot even imagine what she had to go through being years with him and the level of abuse! Whether she is a super weak person or she also is a narcissist... I have no idea! I am very afraid to meet her randomly because I am also embarassed to have basically dated her ex and I am also at the same time scared he might talk to her and use her as a flying monkey or he might start a smear campaign against me. But at the same time I am craving a confrontation with her because I feel she is the only person I could get a confirmation from and understanding about this evil person! Should I tell my good friend to avoid mentioning everything about me and the N with her (his ex gf?).. Maybe it never comes to me meeting her but how do I stop all these thoughts and worries?", "subreddit": "NarcissisticAbuse"}

I told them I wouldn't go and I'd just like to rest, not really up for a buffet. Then everything went downhill. My dad yelling, my bro shouting, everyone getting angry af because I was lying down on the couch, very tired. My dad told me to never bother coming back here, they attacked me about what I ate during my trip to see my friends and how much boring I should have been, my bro said I was sick because I wasn't healthy and I caught tonsilitis prolly because I'm a whore since his female friend did too and that's what she was, etc.\n\nThey left me alone and went to the city at 15 minutes from the house at some point.\n\nWhen my family came back my parents apologized.

I was cleaning up my wardrobe in my old room to make more space for my parents (the reason why I went down to see them tbh), nobody was talking to me, my bro was in his room sulking.

They all went in the sauna to drink, I stayed inside to play games. I didn't know where I was sleeping since the argument so it was 2 in the morning, I needed sleep, I lied back on the couch and when my family came back, my bro assaulted me verbally and it wasn't really pretty I didn't say anything. I had to call a crisis center. I fell asleep somewhere upstairs with earphones on since I didn't want to call the cops on my family. They were all drunk and very... Rude.\n\nNext day my cold worsened, stomach hurts too badly, not enough sleep. Bro still on edge. We went to a restaurant my bro wanted to go.

I asked him if I can continue my story and he took it badly, shouted I wasn't polite and he should block me and never talk to me again, and what of a bitch I am. So I had to text my dad about the details for the grocery store...\n\nDuring our trip back to our city, I couldn't even stay awake. I kept nodding off to sleep. It was yesterday.

We set up a date and boom, even more chemistry in person. We would talk, laugh, be playful with each other. He was always making sure to tell me that he didn\u2019t feel that way with anybody in a long time, he was in a long therm relationship and that he was trying to be single and just meet people and I said him the same. I caught myself sleeping at his place 4 days in a period of 2 weeks. We were getting more and more closer, talking about personal life etc etc. His birthday is 4 days before mine (June) he was making plans, telling me for us to do something for both of our birthdays etc. We had sex twice and things seemed normal, until the day he got upset with me because I didn\u2019t wanna to his house after a couple texts he sent me telling me he wasn\u2019t in a good mood. \nThen I started noticing his mood swings. He told me he wasn\u2019t ready for a relationship (when in the past he\u2019d be like \u201c what can I do to prove you I don\u2019t want just sex from you? I want to be with you \u201c). That was on the day after we had sex, he disappeared and I got so mad and was like telling him he used me for sex and he only said \u201c if you come to my house I\u2019m going to call the police, stop acting like a fucking psycho\u201d\n\n2 weeks later ( Mid June 2018) he comes back messaging me on WhatsApp saying he wanted to talk to me. Apologizing, that he wasn\u2019t ready for a relationship, that things were going too fast but that he felt like everything we had was organic, he takes to his roommates and they told him I was right to be upset and the has the asshole, that he liked spending time with me but that he wasn\u2019t ready for anything serious. I was so into him that I said \u201c ok, let\u2019s be friends with benefits then\u201d.  He said no, that it wasn\u2019t what I really wanted but that he obviously felt attraction beyond normal for me and that asked me if I was sure of that, I said let\u2019s try and see what happens. \nIt worked until Mid July, we got back talking like nothing had happened, things were going good just like before. Exchanging messages, somehow our sex became even better each time we got together.\nThen he started giving me mixed signals, he would disappear for 3 days and come back like saying \u201c did you have a good weekend ignoring me? \u201c to make it seem I was the one that didn\u2019t wanna talk. \nHe was never making plans anymore, he literally was on my Instagram watching my life and not talking to me. Obviously I knew he was seeing other women and I decided to step out and told him, he seemed to understand and we stopped talking. \nEnd of August 2018, I was craving sex with him and made the mistake of messaging him and we hooked up, again I told him that I didn\u2019t want anything with him and deleted him on Instagram. \n\nThen September came, he saw on Bumble and Hinge, he messaged me right away with screenshots of my profile on it saying \u201c look who\u2019s back\u201d , I ignored.\nHe messaged me again saying he wanted to see me, I responded and he ignored. Then days later he came back saying if still wanted to talk to him and I said yes. \nHe did that multiple times: he\u2019d set up dates and flake on the very last minute and not saying anything.he constantly said he wasn\u2019t in a good mood. He was still on all apps.  When he did it the last time, I exploded over texts saying he was immature, that he never faced me, he would never apologize. \n\nNovember came and he messaged me saying \u201c grab a drink with me this week \u201c. \nI was like \u201c look who\u2019s back\u201d. He goes \u201c this is not a sex thing, it\u2019s repentance \u201c .\nThen I was asking why and him for the first time kinda admitted his mistakes, he would be like \u201c I\u2019m sorry for everything I did to you, I know I fucked up. I used you like an object and you didn\u2019t deserve that. I didn\u2019t want emotions to be part of it, but I know it was dumb of me to think we could detach from feelings , I realize now I was being selfish and disrespectful by getting things my way, if you let me I want to look you in the eye and talk to you \u201c.\n\nI said ok let\u2019s talk, he made me believe until the last minute he was gonna come to my place for us to talk and obviously flaked again. He was saying that wasn\u2019t in a good spot, he had doubts, that he needed to be completely alone for a change and that I was a distraction from that. I got pissed and drove to his place, we talked. He said he was depressed, that he had anxiety, I noticed he had gained weight and somehow we ended up having sex. \nRight after it, he started treating me very hostile. \nThat was the moment I realized he was really just using me the whole time for sex and attention. \nHe never cared about my feelings or my well being. \nHe literally kicked me out of his place. I was in shock and trying to understand why he was treating me that way and on the day after ( Thanksgiving Day) I went to his place again to try and talk to him.\nHe did not open the door for me, and texted me saying \u201c Leave my house now. I\u2019m seriously about to call the police, I\u2019m not letting you in this house, you\u2019re a complete fucking psycho\u201d. \nI was drunk and texting him a bunch of stuff, vomiting all my frustrations about him. \n\nI was in shock, devastated, feeling used and emotionally abused by someone I have always treated nicely. Then my mind was on that loop of trying to figure out what I did, and I started remembering all the situations he very subtle manipulated me to go to his house and didn\u2019t take me out, he would schedule something with me and flake and then try to blame me making it seem that I had understood what he said wrongly. He would make inappropriate jokes here and there and say that he was sorry. I remember of reading a text message on his phone where he made a joke with someone and the person replied \u201c watch your language \u201c. \nI questioned myself so many times of why he did what he did, etc. \nIt has been 5 months I haven\u2019t heard from him. \nI never try to go and seek anything about him since that day. Did not block him on social media because I\u2019m not friends with him on anything, haven\u2019t seen his face since that day, literally. Not even a picture. I just don\u2019t have the courage of even seeing a picture on his Facebook or whatever. I got rid of the apps because I did not want to see his profile on it. It has been an intense emotional rollercoaster, I got better but was wondering (again) why? \n\nCombining his behavior (lack of empathy, taking advantage, selfishness)plus the fact he had told me his dad was in jail for years, I could tell that\u2019s something it was bothering him as insensitive parenting as the cause etc I have come to he conclusion he has the narcissistic personality disorder. \n\nReading a few stories on here just reinforced it even more. \nHe had the issues, not me. \nI made many mistakes too, one of them was to allow him to treat me the way he did many times because I cared about him. I still do to be honest. \nI forgave him, but it still hurts. \nI hope God helps him to be better and not hurt people anymore. \nAnd I pray for God to be okay and to be happy. \n\nThank you for reading all this.", "subreddit": "NarcissisticAbuse"}

However, he never had me completely fooled because my gut was always telling me something was off about him and I could see evidence of narcissism from the beginning, I was just in such disbelief about it that I slipped into denial. I don't believe narcissists are any smarter than the rest of us, I think it's actually the fact that they lack emotional intelligence which makes them so reptilian that it's difficult for a regular person to put themselves in their shoes and truly convince themselves another person could be acting on such cold, selfish impulses.

Losing her would most probably feel like heartbreak. We started off being a normal kind of BFF forever, and eventually, we became close, family type of close. We have been in every part of each other life, all the sadness, joy, anger etc.\n\nHowever here's the issue, I can never quite pinpoint when/how it started - we always will have communication break down over ridiculously lame and simple conversation. It could be as simple as with her ranting about her narc co-worker and superior (every single day, over the same issue, different situation that's all). The first few times, I will feel her anger on how her co-workers are treating her, and I'd advise her to start looking out for other opportunities until she found one so she can leave. (FYI - EVERY company she joined and left, she always have the SAME exact issue to rant about) Or how she could have a professional talk with her boss on how the boss could help them; delegating work to ensure each of them has a clearer understanding of their own responsibilities etc; have a talk with her co-worker explaining how the co-worker's behavior is impacting on her workload/work life. However, never once she even tried any of my suggestion, instead, she will simply brush it off by saying - it's not you that are working here, you don't understand the situation here, it doesn't work this way here... Because of the constant rants, she's ranting/ advice I'm suggesting over the years, at some point of time I got sick and tired of this. I make it clear to her that I am tired of listening to her rant while she takes no action to make her work life better and happier. Here is where she will get angry at me, for saying that she did not do anything to make her life; as if she wanted this life. How I always jump straight into the conclusion of her not trying to be happy at work etc; and all she wants is to rant; she didn't need any advice at all.\n\nOr at any point of time where I voice out my opinion that I actually felt her co-worker did no wrong, how her co-worker actually acted on the situation professionally. Basically what I am trying to say is, whenever I voice out my opinion we will surely get into a huge fight - and it will always end with how \"everyone has their own opinion, nobody is right or wrong, is just a misunderstanding/miscommunication somewhere in our conversation\". I have tried many ways to salvage our friendship, to the extent I had actually asked her multiple time (to prevent future conflict) in a similar situation would it be better if I were to say something like \"option A\", \"option B\" or \"option C\". And with the different kind of approach, which would least triggers an argument between us. But it didn't work as well. I have come to the stage whereby every time I was to respond to her text, I'd filter out the different type of response in my mind and make sure it will be something she would rather hear.\n\nAnd in other situation, there's a few time she would actually ask the same question to me and other few mutual friends. All of us could have answered her the exact replies (word for word, because I copy and paste their respond) and yet, she will rage at me for \"voicing out \"my\" opinion). I'd really appreciate some advice - there was many many more situation that had happened between us, for as long as I can remember, we have been arguing every few days for the past 5 years.\n\nI am really feeling very mentally exhausted and I know she feels the same as well. We had had our share of heart-to-heart talk trying our best to understand what's the issue between the both of us exactly. How is it that it's always just both of us but never to other people. Ps: I also know she is trying very hard to avoid conflict between our conversation but it just always turns out the same way.", "subreddit": "NarcissisticAbuse"}

I've certainly been asking questions in the media because I want to see them do the best job they can. \n\nI recently had to deal with an apologist of the church and have also heard similar stories from other survivors. The situation went like this. The apologist took issue with our groups support of the conviction of Cardinal Pell. The apologist felt that Pell could never have done what he did, they felt it wasn't plausible. Having served as an altar boy, the scenario detailed by the victim is totally within the realms of possible. There was much made of the inability of Pell to be able to expose himself through his vestments. I can still picture one of the St Peters and Pauls parish priests having to nip round the back to the toilet to urinate. He had no trouble doing that. I'm still not quite sure why I was asked to accompany him and stand at the bottom of the steps to guard access. What I do know is that he could stand and urinate with vestments on. Similarly, it was felt that a vestry was a very busy place and you could not get any privacy to commit the act that Pell committed. Certainly, St Peters and Pauls wasn\u2019t a cathedral, but I still vividly recollect a deacon spending far too much time trying to make my robe \u201cjust right\u201d before finally being interrupted by the old man that used to take care of all things \u201cout the back\u201d. \n\nThe apologist then raised the concern that if the victim was shown to be wrong on appeal (which he can't be because the appeal is on technical points around the trial, and not his testimony) then it would do huge damage to the survivor community. Let's shine a little light on that statement. Sure, anyone can lie about something, however in the case of sexual abuse of this type it's highly unlikely. The statistics from Pell's very own Melbourne Response show they upheld 326 of 351 claims brought to them. This was from an organisation that was established to minimise the impact and scandal for the church. It\u2019s unclear why 25 were rejected, but suffice to say we can see where the majority of cases lay. It\u2019s not the survivor community that should have its integrity questioned\u2026. ever!\n\nI believe George Pell reviewed all the claims put in front of the Melbourne Response, so should have gained a good appreciation of the suffering that happened in the Melbourne Dioceses alone. However, someone else got to see an even bigger picture. That was Francis Sullivan, CEO of the Truth Justice and Healing Council. This council was established by the Catholic Church in Australia to interface with Australia\u2019s own Royal Commission. I\u2019m not sure if Francis Sullivan knew what he was getting himself into when he took the role, but he was deeply affected by what he learned. When summarising to the Royal Commission he broke down into tears. \n\nThere seems to be some sentiment in NZ that this stuff didn\u2019t happen, that it isn\u2019t as bad as everyone thinks, that survivors are making it up, that the percentages will be less in NZ or that survivors are trying to destroy the church. I\u2019ll counter those thoughts with this video of Francis Sullivan. He\u2019s read through thousands of testimonies and has a better handle than most on how this has played out to date and what the true reality has been for faith based survivors.", "subreddit": "survivorsofabuse"}

I myself was verbally abusive later in our relationship in response to what I couldn\u2019t put a finger on. I felt hurt and emotionally neglected all the time, but I was a naturally happy person. She would always have phases of depression when I was not feeding her my emotions and drag me down with her, then switch places with me. This story is so complicated and long between our behaviors toward each other but I feel it is possible for someone who is narcissistic to accuse you of being narcissistic after they morph you into someone you are not.

I have been her co-worker, protector, best friend, and therapist at work for years. And yes, I'm sort of the classic empath of always wanting to help people. Met her when she left the abusive fiance literally at the alter; then dated a sad messed up guy on a handful of head meds daily; then her last fiance and now 'abusive' husband. There was screaming, crying, begging, fighting, etc., w/ all these guys, including couples therapy at the **dating** stage w/ two of them, i.e., not like the typical 7 year itch of marriage or anything. With her fiance, now husband, she demanded and received a $20k-$30k engagement ring, cheated on him, found herself pregnant and aborted the baby b/c she didn't know which guy was the father, and somehow all of this was the fiance's fault, not hers. He (his abuse) \"made\" her do this. It's clear to me now that she takes a messed up guy and provokes and manipulates him, so that she has victimization stories to tell her friends every other day. She's seeing a therapist, but he's just an enabler, and an idiot if he thinks for a minute that she's giving him objective facts - it's the abusive fantasy world she's created for herself where she is the victim of her father, her fiance, her boyfriend, her fiance/husband, and her occasional female friends.\n\nI realized she's been provoking me to anger for 3 of the last 5 yrs, was pretty good about venting about her to other friends but not really blowing up at her.

She's cut me off completely, won't even acknowledge me in the hallways, and our offices are two doors down from each other.

I'm in a \"relationshit\" with a narc and I feel like the combination of that and her reaching out have been super triggering/stressful. I always get weird around this time of the month too, which doesn't help. I haven't reached out to NM since January when she offered to take me out for my birthday. I initially said, \"Yes,\", but realized I actually didn't want to go, so I kind of \"ghosted\" her.\n\nShe's been trying to reach out to me non-stop on Facebook, logging onto brother's account to message me (he said she pressured him to since her's \"wasn't working), \"liking\" my posts, and writing, \"Please call me,\" on a Facebook status, when I said I was temporarily going to be deactivating for mental health reasons/to take a break from the internet. she has tried to reach out several times in several ways, but I haven't responded/ignored her. The final straw, I think, was when I went to visit her and Nstepdad at their place. She lied and said he wasn't going to come into the house. I can't stand him, he is a mean drunk with a violent temper and he always ends up grabbing my butt, grinding on me, threatening to harm me, making passes, and drunkenly kissing me on the lips.\n\nThere were times he left knives out on the table and looked at me suggestively, tried to come into my room, tried to watch me change, etc. He is a very violent cop who gets drunk and watches videos of people crashing their cars to \"wind down\". I'm very happy to say I finally moved out over a year ago and the women's shelter helped save my life. My mom has ignored the creepy things he has done to me as a child and has stayed in the room as he has grinded on me and ignored it. He would push up against my butt, grab my shoulders, and say, \"Whoops, didn't see you there!\" She ended up telling me I was crazy/imagining it and that it was my mental illness.\n\nHe would touch my waist/lower back and I even saw this in photos of me as a child. he would play the \"tickle game\" and pin me down tickling me. In a video of me as a two year old he was tickling, \"playing\" with me, and lunging up-and-down over top of me, while I laughed and begged him to do it again. He was putting my bare feet in his mouth. A lot of stuff like this.\n\nhe made comments about my sister's and my breasts, asking where we got them from, since my mom's were smaller. We were teenagers/young adults at the time. They have been together since I was two and her and my bio dad separated after a year-and-a-half. I have memories of being molested by my bio dad as a toddler/infant and experiencing incest with him throughout my life. I am NC with him as well.\n\nI think another straw was knowing that he confessed to molesting three of his sisters and made comments about my genitals as a baby. She left him for that and claimed she left immediately after for my safety. He was abusive towards her and was on a lot of alcohol and drugs, but she says that was the final straw. I tried to tell her that I was sexually abused by bio dad and she claimed that she \"watched me at all times\", was a good mom, and never left me alone with him/without supervision. I recalled staying alone at his place in a crib, after the divorce.\n\nI confronted her on it and she was caught in the lie, she looked very uncomfortable/uneasy. I told her one day when we were walking in the park, \"Mom, I think Bio NDad molested me when I was younger,\" She kept walking forward, ignoring me, and looking straight ahead, uncomfortably. Feeling stuck, I told her, \"It's not your fault and you're not a bad mom,\" She smiled quickly, \"Kay,\" and the subject wasn't brought up again for the rest of our walk.\n\nShe also allowed me to share a bed with her brother over the years and this happened over the years. There were covert/emotional incest moments with her too. I will probably explain some later in the post, but I'll probably write another post, more solely focused on her and the abuse, in the future. So, yeah, when I was living in their house and when I would go to visit, knowing how scary and abusive Nstepdad is, would leave me alone in the house with him (often when he was drunk and/or angry), lie that he was working late and would tell me I was in the house, so we could \"reunite\", and would lie that he wouldn't come in the house. In addition to denying the abuse and gaslighting me and my \"illness\" (a lot of Nfamily does this), she lied on several occasions and would play victim/clueless whenever I confronted her. \"Don't look at me, I had no idea he was coming home early!\" Or \"'Dad' is sad and he misses seeing you,\" The final time, I went over to visit to try and see her and my dog, he ended up being at the house, working in the garden, although she lied and said he wouldn't.\n\nTo my horror, he came in the house, out of it and happy to see me. I also found out she was telling him on several occasions that I was afraid of him and didn't like to be touched/get physical affection from him. He would often throw tantrums over this and for me giving her more attention, telling her I love her and not him, etc. He ended up giving me some \"stuff\" for my birthday. A stupid calender and \"police card\".\n\nMy blood boils and I finally had enough and decided to go NC after realizing she enabled and allowed the abuse, denying it. This lady, this thing has the nerve to act like she deserves my time, love, and attention after all of this and the multiple abuses from her over the years. She uses her Huntington's disease to play the victim and act clueless/innocent, when she's not. My car is still under their name/joint, but the women's shelter is helping me to write a letter to the dealership to try and get a donated car, so I can cut ties and go NC completely or at the very least, get them to stop dangling the car over my head. I just feel so fed up and angry and am sick and tired of being \"accidentally tagged\", on \"Happy Birthday posts, for her and my stepdad showing up unannounced at my place on separate occasions, and for his stalking.\n\nI'm done at projecting and hiding my anger, keeping this all in. I hate hurting myself as punishment, towards the anger I feel for them. I'm done letting them ruin my life. I'm just done with all of this and her \"accidental tagging\" and all of her crap over the twenty-seven years I've been alive. Wow, I think this is the most detailed I've got. Thank you for reading.

It's my grandparents' 60th wedding anniversary this summer and my nMom and her nPartner are hosting at their house. There hasn't yet been a time when there hasn't been some sort of drama when I've been there to visit.  First of all, I'm a grown ass adult and living on my own (for many years now) but my mom has always insisted that her home is my home. Since she has been with her current partner (10 years I think), that has never been the case. I stayed with them when I was between school and work a few years ago and was promptly kicked out after a month for doing nothing but help out and mind my business. My mom's partner's daughter got a free ride there for *6 months* while my mom cooked and cleaned and entertained her and her then fianc\u00e9. It took me a lot of years to figure out that my mom and her partner are the problem and not me. And now my husband and I are taking some of what little time off we get this year to go there this summer. Thankfully, the rest of my family is awesome and they will all be there too. All of my aunts, uncles, cousins, and their kids, plus my amazing grandparents. It is literally only my mom and her partner who are super dysfunctional. If there was a hotel nearby, I would definitely consider staying there but they live in rural cottage country.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI know I need to create and enforce boundaries without reacting negatively to whatever they try to pull on me.

I am a 35f here with a partner, 34m, since 2007. Using a throwaway account for this question. I'll try to keep this story from being too lengthy but there will be a tldr at the end, just in case. I'm also on mobile, so please forgive any formatting errors.\n\nSo, in 2015, I developed health issues that drastically changed my life. I had to quit my job and seek treatment. Just a side note, I have since physically and mentally healed over the years and am doing better. Initially, however, the illness and pain I experienced triggered within me a severe depression and thoughts of suicide. I expressed this to my partner and told him that I wanted to die and asked if he would help me end my life. Now, in retrospect, I know how this sounds, but my thinking was obviously not clear.\n\nUpon telling him this, (note: he has never done this before or since) he grabbed my throat and I forced him away from me. I went home and cried, traumatized, as I have been abused in my past relationships, which he knew. I did not see him for years following this, but he told me that his intention was never to hurt me. He claimed that he was trying to snap me out of it and make me recognize that I didn't want to die.\n\nAs stupid as it sounds, after a long span of not speaking, we began to talk on the phone. I told him I still don't trust him and panic at the thought of seeing him. He has since moved on, into a polyamorous relationship with a girl. He told her about me and that she must accept me if he is to be in her life. So, he wants me to ultimately be a part of their relationship. I honestly don't see this happening, for obvious reasons. She also doesn't know the real reason behind why I maintain a distance from him.\n\nI know, overall, that this is something I have control over, in the sense that I have chosen to reconnect with him. I told him that I am resentful for many reasons, one of them being that his girlfriend feels safe with him. He would never do to her what was done to me because he is too afraid of losing her. She, too has had health issues and been previously abused and he seems to feel sorry for her in a way that he never did with me. He tells me he perceives me as tougher than her.\n\nOverall, I am tired of keeping myself in limbo. When I think of this situation or speak with him, all I feel is angry and bitter. When I take space, those feelings dissolve and there is some peace. The answer seems obvious, but what do you guys think? Was this abuse? Should I fully cut off interaction? Thank you so much in advance for your thoughts and insight.\n\nTldr: Isolated incident of partner grabbing my neck when I told him I felt suicidal and wanted to die. We took space but reconnected.
