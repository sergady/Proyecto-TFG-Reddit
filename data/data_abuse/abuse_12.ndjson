But I'm just thinking that it just because of my abuse that my brain is trying to tell me that maybe with girls it would be simple but yet, narcissism have no genders, I can be anyone... I remember when I was 18 when my first love cheated on me, lie to me I was so heart broken and I slapt him right in his his face... I tried to move on but he would stalk me either way (why would you stalk a girl who slapped you?) he came back after 1 years saying that he was sorry for cheating on me, I was heel at that time I forgave him and said that I was sorry for slapping him and moved on... And then... I started attracring narc... I was 21 and that narc 21 too, din't have any ambitions with life, live with his mother and never step outside of his mall town, he would call me a slut for wearing short clothing and one time he slapped me because I was laughing at a story I was reading, we broke up because he had the nerves to call my mother a whore for not wanting me to see him after that another one but with kids 48  everything was fine at first but then, he started asking me to do the chore for him, taking care of his kids when he would go to the gym and din't care about me when mine feelings were hurt, he cheated on me and when I left, he stalked me and try to ask me to date secretly while being with the girl he cheated on me with, I block him for good and then my last narc of this year... Distance relationship... Yelling, slutshaming me beat me two times (one for tickling him and not listen to him but he would tickle me even if I beg him to stop almost for 30 minute... And the second for slipping the window of his car because we were arguing and he left the house  eventhouth he was the one who started the fight because he hate my job as a stripper and din't like the fact that I don't want to quite it for him) , I left because, one time \u00e0 got sexually harassed at work but blame it on me since, I'm a dancer and should not expect for respect from costumers... A'd then after 30 minute said he was horny for me while knowing that I was sexually harassed and din't bother to know if i was emotionally stable at that moment... We are today now..

He says, while he still has some stuff to work on, I should be satisfied with his behavior change and want to continue in the marriage. However, when I observed the following examples this weekend, I find it hard to respect him. Instead, I feel disgusted and incredibly disappointed in his behavior and cannot believe that any true, genuine behavior change has occurred. \n\nAm I being too critical? Am I overreacting to the examples below and allowing them to paint an overly negative picture? I feel like I just dont like him as a person, but maybe its bc I am particularly sensitive at this moment in time. ?\n\n1) we were at my husband's parent's house for Thanksgiving. My husband was having trouble opening a plastic whipped cream container so his father told him to grab a knife and pry it open. Husband grabbed a large butcher's knife. Dad said \"no not that one.\" Husband ignored dad and began using knife to open container. Dad got louder and said \"not that one. You are going to ruin knife.\" Husband ignored and continued using knife. Dad began shouting for him to stop using that knife. Husband continued using knife until container opened. Then husband said loudly to his dad and in front of many people, \"my wife [meaning: me] cant stand when you yell like that.\" The next day, I explained to my husband that it's hard for me to respect someone who treats their father that way and blatantly ignores requests to stop. My husband said \"I cant believe you are fixated on that. I was just....[some excuse justifying why he used knife]. Plus my dad told me to grab a knife.\"\n\n2) today, we were back at husband's parent's house for a small family gathering to celebrate my husband's 34th bday. His aunt was commenting on her new purse's handles being irritating to her. Husband grabbed her purse and said \"you just need to make them longer\" and started to unbuckle and lengthen the straps. Aunt interjected \"no, please dont. I have already tried that. I dont want them any longer.\" Husband ignores her and continues unbuckling and lengthening straps. Aunt again insists that he stop bc she doesnt want them adjusted. He ignores her and completely extends straps to full length. At that point, I interjected and pointed out that he was blatantly ignoring aunt's request and it was disrespectful. Cant remember his exact verbal response but then he got quiet and pouty. Additionally, later he said he would have done the exact thing again.\n\n3) throughout the entire bday celebration this evening, husband did not build on conversation or actively engage anyone in conversation. Instead, every word out of his mouth was either a) sarcastic or b) a one word response. Both of these essentially shut down the conversation rather than make for a pleasant and engaging conversation. Additionally, he complained over and over that others picked out the bday cake and restaurant and didnt care about his preferences.  After party, I pointed out what I observed to husband and explained that it's hard for me to respect and enjoy spending time with someone who is sarcastic or gives 1 word responses for an entire evening. His response: he doesnt want to be criticized by me any more.", "subreddit": "NarcissisticAbuse"}

Just wanted to ask, because I really can't get to anything so far when thinking about it.\n\nOk, so narc tries to get people around to exact same worldwide roles: flying monkeys, golden child, scapegoats, maybe drama observers. And narc makes statements about people, false claims.\n\nAnd the strange thing is that if narc tells bad things about someone  - everybody around believes it. But when someone says back that \"hey, this is a narc, he tells a lie\" - only best and adequate people hear it, but most of the time nobody believes. I personally didn't try that, and I really don't want to take a risk now, because in my current situation it can backfire me really hard. I learned this phenomenon from sources on narcissism issue.\n\nOk, narc makes mask to appeal as normal. But doesn't codependent really is and appeal normal? From masks perspective it is comparison between two \"normal\" people, isn't it?\n\nThere was a hint on one youtube video that provoking a narc to get angry when everybody gathered may make somebody to doubt, but it is probably another topic.\n\nWhat do you think on why this trust \"reverse\" happens? Why people believe statements one way only? Maybe you have seen some related videos or other resourses? Thank you.", "subreddit": "NarcissisticAbuse"}

I have wanted to see him in concert since I was young and this may be the last chance.\n\nThe tickets had been in the same place since I purchased them in August. (I wanted the real paper ticket for a memory.) I went to retrieve them to put in my purse and they were gone. My daughter and I tore the house apart looking. I immediately knew the narc did this. I had a memory of him seeing the envelope when he stopped by a few days earlier to pick up some items.\n\nWe tried to think of where he would hide them...what would an asshole do with them, basically. We never found them. I called him to confront and got a 20 minute circular argument with him offering to come to the house to \"help find them\". I said no because we all know he planned to bring them with him to plant them somewhere.\n\nThis brings his evil to a whole new level because regardless of how much he hates me, he did this to our daughter too. She has had a flare of her Graves disease and he knows that stress can cause a cardiac incident. \n\nI now know I have to change jobs and never see him again. He had been hoovering me at work so I must move on.

They were both happily playing with them when their dad comes in \"raging\" as he calls it. He starts yelling at our daughter about toys in the floor in a corner when I put them... I told him that and to stop but he continued to tell her he was going to throw them away. Then our son picked up a pill bottle his dad had left on the floor.. He actually smacked my son's hand for it. Note, this was 100% preventable if he would pick things up! He even got onto him yesterday for spilling his soda. The soda I told him not to leave there because our son would spill it. How could you scold a child for something YOU did? I realize that he is going to ruin our holiday regardless of me trying to keep it together until then.

I no longer have access and I our Christmas tree was supposed to go up yesterday so I could hide the elf in the tree with the calendars. Clearly that did not happen.

I was having trouble holding the whole thing up while pulling at the same time. He got angry and pushed it as hard as he could knocking me into the wall and hurting my back and hip.

It\u2019s hard to think back and remember the times when I would be so wound up, waiting for the other shoe to drop, hanging on this man\u2019s every word and action to see whether or not I\u2019d be in the clear to feel \u201chappy\u201d for a few more hours or if a storm was brewing. Hint: it always was. My emotions/CPTSD were on a hair trigger and I felt completely unstable most of the time. I have audio recordings/journals of myself crying and babbling on about how helpless I was and how reliant on the breadcrumbs of kindness I became. I did everything for this person and he treated me like I was nothing, discarded me over and over again until the final discard where he even stole money from me. He left me multiple times for a trashy exconvict drug dealer who wasn\u2019t even prettier than me (low blow, I know), and probably cheated with many other women throughout. I know you know what I\u2019m talking about. The more that I read what you guys are going through and reflect on what I went through, the more I see how far I\u2019ve come.\n\nI don\u2019t cry over any man now and I\u2019ve been working hard to set boundaries with people in my life whenever I feel like someone may be beginning to take advantage of me. I don\u2019t have another relationship and I don\u2019t know if I really want one at all, because I\u2019m perfectly fine being \u201cselfish\u201d and only doing the things I want to do ALL OF THE TIME! It\u2019s peaceful! \n\nI guess my point of this post is, to those of you currently in the thick of it... it WILL get better once you completely fully 100% cut ties with the N\u2019s in your life. My friends and family were so sick of me crying and complaining about Nex that many of them stopped talking to me and as a result I started shutting people out because I felt like I was alienating people. Unless people know about toxic relationships and abuse already, they really don\u2019t get it. I read about Narcissists and NPD while I was with my Nex but tried to rationalize that we were ok or he wasn\u2019t completely a N. But, he was, and I knew that deep down none of it was right or I wouldn\u2019t be looking stuff like that up in the first place. After he left me for the millionth time, I was alone and I knew it was different this time. I cried, I asked whatever higher power... not for the N back, but for PEACE. It got to a point where I didn\u2019t know who I was without the abuse defining me, tbh. But, I made it out. Lived by myself, took epic solo vacations, make positive career shifts, started taking control of my finances and weeded out the toxic friends, too. You CAN do this and it gets a million times easier and better over time. Reclaim your lives and live them to the fullest!

We became friends when I was in seventh grade and he was in eighth.  We were completely platonic up until around six months ago, when he began to develop a crush on me.  He knew that I was trans before pursuing a relationship with me, and told me he wasn't gay, but he had feelings for me.  His friends all hated me from the start because they felt that I was just leading him on and taking advantage of him, which he would often bring up to convince me to be with him.  After a potential s/o who I really, really liked told me he wanted to just stay friends, It was like I had a hole punched into my heart.  Which yes, seems extremely dramatic, but I hate being alone and I'm very dependent in nature, especially since I have BPD (Borderline Personality Disorder).  He came along and confessed his feelings for me, and I rejected him twice before he gave me an ultimatum which was to be with him or to never speak with him again.  Deep down inside I was furious that he could do something so disgusting and unfair to me, and that same part of me suggested that if that what who he really was, maybe I'd be better off not speaking to him.  However, for the most part I was incredibly lonely having just gone through the hardship of someone abruptly cutting off the possibility of having a relationship with me, I felt like I couldn't emotionally handle losing a friend I've had for 5 years.  So I agreed to be with him.  He was very charming at first, which almost made me forget how he guilt tripped me into the relationship.  However, about three weeks in he asked me to come over, so I did.  We watched a movie on the couch and ate snacks until he suddenly got on top of me and started grinding on me.  I was shocked, but as long as no clothes were removed and we didn't go farther than that it was okay.  He started getting more intense, and tried to take off my sweater.  I said no, and he suddenly started sulking, telling me he was a terrible person.  I said it was fine and that he wasn't, but then he started grinding again, pinning my wrists down and whispering into my ear asking if I've ever been fucked on a couch before.  I was scared because of how tight his grip was and I nervously shook my head.  He asked if I wanted to try it, and again I declined and said I just wanted to cuddle.  He sulked again but then started grinding again.  This time I stayed silent because I was just scared to say anything by that point.  He took my silence as an invitation.  He went upstairs to his room and came back down with a condom.  He went as far as to open it and put it on and asked me if I was ready.  I said no, and annoyed, I told him that I said no multiple times and it felt like he wasn't listening to what I wanted at all.  He got angry at me and told me I should've said something the third time and that I owe him a new pack of condoms because that was his only one.  I got pissed off at him and told him that it was his own fault for not listening to me the first two times and he just said \"Oh, so you're one of those people who can't be at fault for anything and constantly blame the innocent party for their own actions.\"  I just stopped talking and to be honest, he actually made me feel like I was the bad guy for entirely blaming him.  The next day, he wanted me to come over again.  When I said no, he started to guilt trip me.  Telling me that it's because of that fight we had the day before and that I need to grow up and admit that I was wrong.  I told him I was wrong so that he'd stop talking about it, and then reluctantly went to his house.  He took my upstairs and told me he just wanted to sleep as he held me.  It actually sounded nice, so I agreed to do it.  He started getting incredibly touchy, grabby, and told me he wanted to have sex with me.  I said I just wanted to sleep and reminded him that's what we were upstairs for.  He continued to touch me though, and kiss my neck, and wouldn't take a hint that it was making me extremely uncomfortable.  He undressed me, and I was too frozen to stop him.  He got up and got a condom out of his dresser.  I turned my back to him and heard him opening the wrapper and then putting on the condom.  I just cried silently, scared to oppose him.  He flipped me on my back and he got what he wanted.  I walked home alone an hour later and I couldn't even cry.  I was just blank faced and crossing my arms to cover what was already covered because I was paranoid and I felt so dirty.  I started to tell him he could only come to my place (because my parents are always home and they're more strict on rules than his parents are).  We were still allowed in my room but there wasn't much to do so I suggested we play a video game in the basement.  I left the door open and my boyfriend just took me by the arm and brought me to the bed.   I was too nervous to dispute with him and I fell asleep beside him.  He told me it'd be hot if he fucked me while I was trying to sleep and I told him not to.  He said \"okay\" which surprised me because usually he would put up a fight or just disregard what I wanted altogether.  He told me he was going to the bathroom and then I fell asleep again, thinking he was telling the truth.  He came back whenever and when I woke up he had pulled my pants down and started having sex with me again.  I started crying loud enough for him to know and hear but he didn't care, and later told me that he thought I said yes and my crying was moaning.  I avoided seeing him for a month after that.  On top of all the sexual and mental abuse, he would also introduce me as a girl to all of his friends and family.  Telling me he would only address me as male when he wanted to.  If I don't answer calls or messages he says something really mean to get my attention.  He'll call me a slut, whore, accuse me of sleeping with other people, call me neglectful, crazy, a bitch, tell me that everything I get upset over is just me overreacting because I have BPD, he often tries to do nice things for me or puts on a nice act right after he rapes or verbally abuses me.  He pinned a condom we used for one of the very few times I've actually consented to sex with him and then got angry with me for telling him to buy me an EC after he confessed to pinning it so that I could get pregnant and feel obliged to stay with him.  I never ended up getting said EC because I don't have money, my parents aren't the best people in my life either, and he refused to get me one.  I literally might be pregnant with my abuser's baby now which destroys me because not only would it be my abusers baby but the pregnancy would also cause me a shit ton of dysphoria.  I know I should've left him a long time ago but I'm fucking terrified of him because of the way he is when he doesn't get what he wants.  I'm starting to get depressed.  I'm mentally and physically exhausted and believe it or not this isn't the first abusive relationship I've had, it's the third.  I feel like a failure, and like this is my fault, and I don't know why so many people hurt me.  If there's one thing I like about myself it's that I'm one of the sweetest, most harmless people you'll ever meet.  I don't understand how it's so easy for people to hurt someone like me when I do nothing but look out for everyone else.  I need out.", "subreddit": "abuse"}

Really started sticking with the medication the last few years and notice an awesome change in my relationships at work and with family.  Looking back at things, I think that my husband and I were codependent.  He is a very heavy drinker (probable alcoholic).  For years he would get really angry with me in the mornings, accusing me of losing his keys, etc.  I would get dramatically upset, then he would be fine in the afternoon.  I never pieced it together until a few years ago that he was hungover.  He would drink in secret and hide his bottles.  I started paying attention after we went on a vacation one year and noticed he drank three fifths of rum in 4 and a half days.  There was no where to hide the bottles in the airbnb we had rented.  He does not acknowledge that he has a drinking problem.  His father is an alcoholic who was very physically abusive to him growing up.  \n\nIn the past he has held me down and forced me to have sex, often with extreme pain.  He acted like nothing happened afterwards or if I was upset that I was just being dramatic.  He would be nice the next day.   He has hidden cameras in the house. I discovered one when we had a plumber over and he unscrewed a thing in the bathtub.  He says, \"did you know there was a camera in here?\"  I was mortified.  At one point about a year ago he got jealous and threatened to call my work to tell them I quit.  He put a tracker on my phone so he knows my location at all times.  I have never cheated, but did flirt when I was manic, about 7 years ago.  I admitted this to him and expressed how sorry I was after it happened.  \n\nAbout 6 years ago we started going to church.  He did change somewhat, trying harder to be more emotionally available.   He wasn't getting as upset with me.  He is studying to be a minister.  I think he intellectually gets the spiritual stuff, but has trouble putting it into practice. I lost my daughter 6 years ago too, and he had been a great step dad to her.  She really cared about him. So I have a lot of guilt about getting out of this.  About 6 months ago I seriously began to consider leaving.  He has been absolutely sweet and loving to me, I'm sure he knows something is up.  I have looked into getting my own apartment.  I also feel bad about letting 18 years of marriage go, because even though he's awful sometimes, there were good times in there too.", "subreddit": "emotionalabuse"}

This is going to be a two part post. The first detailing my personal experience and the second detailing a current situation I am wrapped up in. I'll do my best to keep them as short as possible.\n\nI spent most of my early 20s in a horrible cycle with a narc. We were together for around 5 years and I loved her with absolutely everything in me. She had been a friend of mine for a few years and I confided in her about the problems I was having in my relationship at the time. She convinced me to leave and spent nearly a year love bombing me until I was pretty sure she was the one. What followed were the best 6 months of my life followed by the worst 4 years of my life. \n\nI eventually grew into my own person despite her presence in my life and the relationship blew up. She broke down and had to face all of the horrible things she had done and eventually she came out the other side as an improved (although not fully recovered person). She contacted me a few years later to apologise she her actions and cried for hours. We never spoke again after that.\n\nFast forward to part 2. I found out a friend/girl I dated a few times has been in a horribly abusive situation with the front runner for narc of the year. I mean this guy is a walking billboard for NPD symptoms. He has cheated on her with her friends, brought prostitutes into the home while she and her child were there. Made her sleep in the garage so the other girls wouldn't see her and made her pay rent for the privilege. \n\nEventually she left and called me asking for help. I got her out and spent almost a year trying to work her through her issues. During that time i found out that he had been abusing her for the previous 7ish years and before that there were 3 other men who honestly all looked exactly alike and all abused her. \n\nI got her to go to therapy and she seemed like she was improving, but she wasn't. She had been hiding that she had went back with him again (15th time) and the reason we found out is his co-workers caught him watching hidden camera footage of her and reported him and it became a massive ****show. She ignored everything and pretended the event didn't happen. \n\nThey are now engaged and he's still cheating on her and being an absolutely horrible human being and she stays well medicated with anti-depressants and continues to pretend none of it is happening.\n\nI once showed her proof of an incident and she quite literally went off the deep end, became hysterical and irrational and became dangerous towards herself. It permanently damaged our friendship and I don't try to talk to her about it anymore as I do not believe she can handle it.\n\nSo now my question is what can be done if anything? At this point it's obvious he is far more important to her than anything else in her life including her children (she will actively put them at risk to make him happy). \n\nI hate leaving her in this situation as all she does is cry and try to hurt herself when he does things to her while simultaneously denying that anything is going on and refusing to leave the situation.\n\nSorry for the long post everyone.", "subreddit": "NarcissisticAbuse"}

I hate how easily he can get into my head and how quickly I can fall into something with him. I know logically what he is saying isn't true, but the addiction to him keeps me hooked. \n\nAnyway, he gives me the whole spiel, tells me I'm his only love, how much he misses me, how he thinks about me every single day, how he's still in love with me and cares about me so much. Then, of course, he's still in a relationship. So now this will make it the second time that he's cheated on his current partner, that I know of (I view going behind your current partner's back to tell your ex that you're still in love with them and a slew of other things that you wouldn't say in front of your partner to be cheating, along with sexual comments). He tells me that while he wants to be with me, he knows he can't. He tells me that this relationship he is in is healthy and is good for him. That it's stable and supportive, and for once he's not feeling crazy (whatever that means). And him telling me this sent my mind spiraling. \n\nI keep going back and forth in my mind with logical and illogical thinking. Logically, I know that all of it is bullshit. I think for the first time, he just found someone that is less likely to speak up and call out his bullshit. That is willing to give into him and this is what he views as a \"stable, healthy, and supportive relationship.\" And if it was so healthy, he wouldn't be contacting me and telling me those things and trying to get things out of me. Knowing him, he's bored and he's searching outside of the relationship for stimulation while still trying to maintain that \"stability\" he has in the relationship. \n\nYet, I'm also struggling with the illogical thinking. It brought up a slew of irrational thoughts and insecurities. I have a huge issue with comparing myself to the other women he's cheated on me with or been in a relationship with. I don't have this issue at all outside of him. It's only when it involves him that it reals its ugly head. Anyway, now I'm wondering to myself if maybe this girl really is the one that is right for him? That he will change for her and be in a healthy and stable relationship with her? That they will last and have a life together. I feel anxious that my logical thinking might actually be wrong and I'm just lying to myself. \n\nI spent all last night and today crying, feeling very upset with myself that I let myself give in. When I ended things yet again, I gave into my emotional feelings and wrote him way too much. I hate when I do that because it makes me feel so weak and needy. I feel like he has all the power and it just shows how crazy I am because I'm spilling out my feelings and telling him how selfish it is for him to contact me like that and to not respect me by staying away. I could have just walked away and said nothing, but instead I decided to say too much. I'll bounce back from this quickly, I'm just ashamed of myself for looking and being so weak. Luckily it was only a day and this didn't go further than that. \n\nI just need some logical output from others, because I'm bouncing back and forth in my mind and I need some type of logical reasoning to grasp onto.", "subreddit": "NarcissisticAbuse"}

We connected on a dating app but we actually have known each other for years through a mutual best friend. It was immediate connection, the conversations were quite literally intoxicating. He was (IS) so witty, so smart, and we shared the same taste in music. Which, anyone who knows me, is the unofficial way to my heart. We talked about setting up a first date. This is where I should have known...there were so many signs. But I brushed them off because I was DUMB over this guy. We talked about meeting for drinks for about a week, he was oddly super into it and avoiding picking a date at the same time. (First red flag) Anyway, we talked about grabbing a drink that Friday, he said he may have family things to do but if not we \"definitely should.\" Friday came, no word..I texted him after work to see what the deal was, turns out he did have to do something with family but wanted to \"lock in\" next Friday. I was a little peeved that he didn't feel the need to tell me this and I had to reach out. But again, brushed it off. Next Thursday rolls around,we hadn't made a concrete plan so I reached out on Thursday night....crickets.....No response. I was sick to my stomach. Thought I was being ghosted. Two days later he messages me on Instagram telling me his phone and wallet were stolen and he was so sorry and he needed my # again. Like a moron, I complied, even sympathized. And wow, typing all of this out is so eye-opening. We finally went on our first date, but I made it convenient for him, met him at a bar in his neighborhood. It was an amazing date, the connection was magnified, it felt like cloud 9. I was told it was the \"best first date ever\" for him, among many, many other sweet and romantic things. The next month or two was a cycle of me trying to make plans, him being flakey, we saw each other a few times but I had to do ALL the work. In between all of this he gave me some story about his ex girlfriend wanting him back (he said he didn't want to get back with her bc she cheated on him, which I am now questioning as well) and it was making him emotionally unavailable. He would send me novels about his feelings, of which I completely believed. I thought he was so genuine and in fact refreshing, telling me how he was feeling, being honest. Now I see it was all calculated, ways to absolve him of any responsibility for my feelings. This went on for a few months, the ups and downs, seeing each other sparsely, until I eventually couldn't do it anymore. The intense love bombing and then the canceling of plans or going days without responding. I was so up and down, I was depressed, couldn't eat, had to leave work early on multiple occasions because of panic attacks. I just felt in my heart when we were together that I had finally met my type because of the humor and his certain look and shared interests. But all the while he was destroying me on the inside, I second guessed every move I made every word I said. I hated myself when I would text something and he wouldn't respond. Everything was MY fault.Come Summer I told him I couldn't do it anymore, in a nutshell. He of course gave me a long winded response of how he understood and he was sorry he was just so unavailable, blah blah blah. It was rough getting over him, but I did it, well for the most part. My feelings were still there, just dormant. \n\nSo, of course, he messages me this past September....Saying he couldn't stop thinking about me, I was the one he was supposed to be with, on and on. I ate it all up, thinking maybe with the passed time, he had worked on himself and gotten to a better place. He then proceeded to tell me, HOWEVER he was dating someone....but still wanted to see me, maybe as a friend thing., because he didn't think this person was right for him. Things ended with us in the Summer because he wasn't ready for a relationship...and I come to find he easily got into a relationship with someone else. I was angry and upset and told him I wasn't going to be his testing ground for his feelings for this person. I told him to leave me be. No response to that message....He reaches out a few weeks later and of course I respond. I ask him why he never could respond to my last message and he told me he was broken. I should also mention he told me he is moving across the country in a few months...Doesn't have a date yet, but says he is. And depending on our conversations, sometimes he says ASAP and sometimes he says eventually. Every Friday since then he has messaged me, telling me he wants to see me and how much he loves talking to me. HE would reach out, HE would make plans and then HE would bail. It happened 3-4 times. The first time he bailed he told me he was worried about his feelings and that our casual hangs might become more...and he's \"moving across the country.\" Which I now see was complete bull, as he was just laying the foundation for himself to be absolved of any responsibility. We did see each other...a week ago..We met for drinks and he came home with me...only to leave around 1am, and when I got upset he told me \"we talked about this\" and he told me to \"put that nonsense thought away.\" This is where that earlier convo comes into play, where he was so \"worried\" about his feelings. All complete nonsense. And I can see all of this, I'm just a ball of putty when he messages me. I have no strength with him. I know that I have allowed these patterns..And he is completely toxic. He uses me and discards me and he knows exactly what to say to get what he wants. I feel like an idiot for even agreeing to see him last week...but he's like my drug. A habit that I need to kick..it's destroying me. I came here to share my story and ask for advice and thoughts and support to finally say no to him and go no contact.

I love reading these posts and other therapy and self help, but I\u2019ve found that coupling that with a practical approach is making this process much easier. \nThis time around after the discard I\u2019ve taken some very basic and practical steps to feel better. It\u2019s important to stress that narcissistic abuse over a long period of time  CHANGES you at a neurochemical level. I\u2019m not an expert, by any means, but here are some tips I\u2019ve been swearing by that are helping me. \n\n1. EXERCISE: Hear me out, revenge body is obviously also a motive, but after a narc, you\u2019re most likely going to feel weak and vulnerable. You are neither. Working out, and finding a work out that feels good for you makes you feel strong. You ARE strong, you\u2019ve been through hell. Exercising helps you associate the acquisition of endorphins with something other than your abuser. I promise you, this is so simple and so basic, but this has helped me SO MUCH. It\u2019s helped me feel worthy, and it\u2019s a promise that I keep to myself every day. \n\n2. TAKE VITAMINS. EAT HEALTHY: Again, you\u2019re probably like *eye roll* but please hear me out. I had a really unhealthy relationship with food when I was with my narc. I had a secret eating disorder. I didn\u2019t make any healthy choices when it came to food whatsoever and it was terrible on my body and self image. Recently, I consume anything and everything that I am confident will make every cell in my body feel good. This includes taking a multivitamin, taking probiotics (a lot of serotonin production takes place in the gut), drinking PLENTY of water,  and eating everything green and leafy and full of life. I\u2019m sad and broken, but if I have to eat big salads every single day to feel better, I will, I deserve to be happy, you do too. \n\n3.  BREATH WORK: tension and shortness of breath became my norm because of my narcissistic relationships. I couldn\u2019t take a deep breath to save my life, seriously. Learning about breath work and actively checking in on my breath has made my tension and shoulder pain near nonexistent. My body has never felt this good. I still cry, sure, but I can breathe deeply and not shake and that is PRICELESS. \n\n4. FIND A CREATIVE OUTLET: this step is just as important as the others. You have a lot to say, I\u2019m sure. There were so many times you were probably silenced or times you silenced yourself to keep the peace. I hear ya. Finding a creative outlet like music, painting, or writing will do wonders for you and give you a medium through which you can express yourself, read back your own words and validate your own emotions. It\u2019s time to say everything you haven\u2019t been able to say now. \n\nMy tips sound so basic, and I\u2019m questioning my own post, but sometimes reframing how we think of basic self care can really make a difference. I\u2019m just trying to put out there was is helping me empower myself and hoping that it can help someone else too. You\u2019re a warrior, you\u2019ve been through a lot, and you should treat and carry yourself as such. I\u2019m sending you love and luck.

My parents were very abusive to me and my  sister and i always thought fuck it i have at least my sister who loves me but i realized that she abuses me too. She always insults and yells at me for little things. I dont do something for here because i want to make her happy, i do it because im scared. She apolgizes after she yells sometimes but few days later she will do it again. She also sees things as self explanatory, my mother gives us not much money for  food and i give her every week 10 more but she never says thank you and when i dont want to give the money and spend a little bit for myself she yells at me again and makes me feel that im a bad person. But my actual question is do i deserve it? Because when we were younger i remember that i also was sometimes abusive to her i was just a stupid kid back then she also was mean sometimes when we were younger but that dont justify my abuse. But i dont do it anymore and i did apologize. I just dont know what to do i stant up for myself and talked a bit about it and now she dont talk with me for 2 days. Is this even abuse?

Having A Hard Time Dealing With This And Finally Letting Go. 29/M", "author": "bonbon_3589", "self_text": "I left for medical school a year ago and was partially relieved to be free from living with my then-girlfriend.\n\nWe eventually split up due to distance, the lack of resolution in disagreements, depression, and a lot of other issues. She initiated the breakup last year and I agreed. I finally picked up the last of my things from our apartment (that we shared for four years) and she's moving out of state tomorrow.\n\nSeeing her face-to-face again churned up a lot of feelings and I feel like a wreck.  I've recently come to terms with the fact that she's been abusing me, and, like a typical victim, I've been blaming myself  for where things ended up. I keep flipping between acknowledging the abuse and punishing myself physically/emotionally for screwing up an 'ideal' relationship. Last night I wanted to commit myself to a mental health facility but a friend talked me down.\n\nIf anyone can point me in the right direction in terms of coping mechanisms, healthy habits, and personal epiphanies I'd really appreciate it. I can also answer any necessary questions.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFor the people who need to know what I went through, I'll provide that below just so you can get a better picture of the emotional abuse I endured:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\-Blocked mutual friends on facebook and refused to be around them if she thought I discussed relationship issues with them\n\n\\-Withheld affection, both physical and emotional. It was never implied to be a punishment but after 6-8 months without so much as a hug or a kiss I felt like I was losing my mind. This went on for years. One night I grabbed a bottle of whiskey and sat it down between us and opened up, putting myself in a vulnerable position. I said 'sometimes I just need a goddamn hug' as I was crying, and she sat there stone-faced. I'll never forget that.\n\n\\-When I got emotional during arguments or got upset about things she told me in general, she told me multiple times to 'man up' or to stop being so sensitive - even we've already discussed and agreed to eschewing gender norms/roles.\n\n\\-Despite wanting to avoid the traditional man/woman father/mother roles in a couple she would make a sarcastic comment if I didn't open a door for her or pull a seat out when we were on a date. This went on for the entirety of our relationship\n\n\\-Constantly criticized and pushed around in the bedroom, lots of rolled eyes, frustrated sighs. I felt inadequate and for the first time in my life developed a PE disorder. (I've never had sexual issues before or after this relationship)\n\n\\-Accused me of gas-lighting often, and it became clear at the end she was projecting\n\n\\-In an argument she's told me she could 'find another n\\*\\*\\*\\* in a second' and made me feel entirely replaceable. Said she could take care of herself easily, that men would jump at the chance to care for her, etc.\n\n\\-Made the accusation that the only reason I fell in love with her was because I fetishize black women.\n\n\\-Punched a hole in the wall during one argument, which she patched days later. She got physical and put her hands on me to shove me just once. I'm 6'3 so that didn't really concern me.\n\n\\-Screamed about how much she hates my guts when I'm leaving the apartment after an argument. That happened multiple times\n\n\\-Called the police on me in an attempt to intimidate me out of the apartment we're co-tenants on - We were arguing and she felt hurt and told me to leave. I said I wasn't finished with what I was saying and she threatened to call the cops with claims of harassment. Once she got the local PD on the phone I left.\n\n\\-Rarely apologized for anything I brought up, no matter how important it was to me.\n\n\\-When i would bring up issues in our relationship and things she does that upsets me she would immediately counter with 'well when was the last time this happened', as if I had a date in mind, and my pause would give her satisfaction.\n\n\\-Asking for financial assistance and never paying me back. I would actually be shamed and guilted for bringing it up, and told that 'we should've just had a more formal arrangement' when I gave her the money, as if her not paying was my fault. She would say 'fine', I'll pay you back ASAP since that's all you care about, and then I feel like shit and she never pays me back.  She's actually turned this idea of me being a greedy asshole into a narrative so I was always afraid to ask her to pay me back.... Thousands in rent money, hundreds in money she 'needed' and then forgot to repay. Asked me to venmo her 20 to buy a drink for a friend one night.\n\n\\-In addition to the previous note: would randomly call me for emergency favors, financial or otherwise. If I do them there's a minor 'thank you' and then silence. If I don't she acts like she never needed my help in the first place.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI hope this doesn't come across as an 'emotional dump' of a post, because I really am seeking guidance.

One of his favorite things to do is to call me controlling ...after all I told my counselor she told me I was grasping at straws for any semblance of control bc he had all of it.\n\nToday, I also realized after numerous situations (bc he pulls this shit alllll the time) he is also projecting his rude attitude and behavior onto me.  He makes a super rude or degrading remark-I shut down and become dismissive toward him-he accuses me of having a bad attitude and being rude.\n\nI\u2019m starting to piece things together and actually write down and track his behaviors should I ever need to use it in a consult with a lawyer.  \n\nIt took me a while to see my husband\u2019s projection bc he is so good at manipulating it to make me feel at fault.

Is that wrong?\nI met him in November 2016. We became boyfriend and girlfriend almost immediately and he got me to start experimenting with drugs. It started off as mostly weed. I was staying at his place constantly and lost touch with my best friend/roommate. He was controlling. He wanted me to be a certain way, do things his way, take the drugs that he said. He would organize medications and pills for me to take every morning. He injected me with hormones in an attempt to increase my sex drive. He always made me feel guilty if I didn\u2019t drink or do drugs or have sex with him. I stopped talking to all my friends and my family. I would ignore every time I got sick from taking too many pills. Eventually I had to start crushing the pills and putting the powders in a drink. It was horrible. By March, I was living at his place full time and decided to move out of my other place because I didn\u2019t want to pay rent there anymore. We had been dating for about three months and were very serious. We talked about marriage. But it was seriously costing me money. He was barely working, complaining about needing to be on disability for many different things, and I was footing the bill for a lot of things. Even when I didn\u2019t want the drugs, I was buying them.\nThe sex was the worst part. He liked to watch porn together and have us touch ourselves, then eventually each other and turn into sex. Then it turned into us never having sex and him just wanting to get jerked off or use his toy. He would make me take drugs before we got sexual. Started as caffeine, moved onto harder stimulants. He wanted to make me orgasm over and over until I was light headed, dizzy, exhausted, begging him to stop. Then he would expect me to do the same for him but I had no brain cells left to do anything it felt like. This wasn\u2019t what I wanted. I felt forced into it every time. \nAt the end of March, I had a seizure. This was caused by him cutting up my antidepressants (Wellbutrin) in quarters to break the time release. As a stimulant. However, an overdose on Wellbutrin = seizure. So I had one at the top of the stairs. Yet I didn\u2019t leave.\nIn June, we had no money. No drugs. Nothing. We were getting desperate. I\u2019d always been struggling with mental health issues, and so was he. I said \u201clet\u2019s Romeo and Juliet it.\u201d He took it seriously. We booked a hotel room for a week, leaving our apartment a mess. We did lots of drugs - so many I can\u2019t remember the week. Apparently the place was in \u201cirreparable shape\u201d but I wouldn\u2019t know because I can\u2019t remember anything. The last thing I really remember clearly was months before. I knew I wanted to die, because he made me miserable, but I loved him. I couldn\u2019t live with him, and I sure as hell couldn\u2019t live without him. I guess he felt the same way. Anyway, at the end of the week, we each took a handful of benzodiazepines. My credit card declined and they were forced to come into our room. They found me barely breathing, 14% or something like that. They found him already gone. If it wasn\u2019t for me throwing up all over myself I probably would have died sooner. I remember thinking last minute, \u201cthis isn\u2019t what I want.\u201d But it was too late.\nI spent two days in a medically induced coma while the drugs left my brain. Four days in ICU in total. The worst part is that when I woke up, I asked for him. \nSo I need opinions and stuff, idk. What do people think?

I explained that he should be more curious about me than he was. I explained this many times as carefully as I could. He always pretended to be confused and would remind me in so many words that he was doing me a favor by being in contact with me at all. There was no big falling out at the end, he just went MIA for a while (not unusual) and I quietly blocked him while he was not communicating with me. \nHe never tried to Hoover or contact me in any other way. making me feel even more insignificant although I know it\u2019s for the best.\n\nAt first I knew I was angry but was not sure why it was justified. Then the anger passed and the loss and sadness settled in. I\u2019d play it over and over in my head, \u201cif only this, if only that it would have all been different.\u201d each time I\u2019d try to remind myself that he had more than three years to make a real effort and it was going to go on the same way it had been forever if it was up to him. I had to remind myself how sick it was making me and what an agonizing choice it was for me to give up on the hope for a real connection. I had to remind myself I didn\u2019t take any of it lightly. I had to remind myself that even if I could get him to listen he would not be capable of changing. I think the loss of potential/hope/dream (however false it was in the end) is the hardest part for me. My mind wants to romanticize it and keep the trauma bond alive. This is how I learned the concept of self talk. When I feel the waves of sadness and anxiety I say to myself, \u201cit\u2019s ok to feel that way, you just aren\u2019t over it so let it happen. It\u2019s no wonder that you aren\u2019t over it when it meant so much to you. Of course you still grieve..\u201d usually the waves pass by somewhat quickly.\n\nWe have to be careful not to punish ourselves for making a choice we never wanted. I still love the person, it was excruciating to just disappear when I was still so bonded. I didn\u2019t leave because I did not love him. \nI left in spite of my love. And any discussion would just end with me deeper in the game. He wasn\u2019t going to be the one to stop it. It\u2019s taken literally 8 months to forgive myself for doing this to myself. Or to stop looking at it that way. Now when I wish I could talk to him there\u2019s a certain comfort in there is literally nothing to be said. I felt like a terrible person for disappearing. And not in his \u201cmaybe a few days, maybe a few weeks\u201d way. But permanently. He really liked causing me emotional distress and then getting me to forgive him. I think it is how he feels loved or valued. It\u2019s pretty sick. I don\u2019t look at his social media because it will cause my such sadness and anxiety. I removed him from my physical world.

I left his house that day feeling the most numb is ever felt in my life, and this was several years ago now. When he was done, he told me that now I\u2019d never forget him, which seemed like a pretty sick thing to say to somebody after something like that. But I guess he was right. Things were purely sexual after that, and I broke up with him about a month later after I realized I had no more respect for him. I\u2019m not fully sure if it constitutes as abuse, but Years later, I still feel kind of numb about the whole ordeal.", "subreddit": "survivorsofabuse"}
{"post_id": "e4v90l", "created_utc": 1575269623, "title": "Are these signs of potential sexual abuse?", "author": "edoctuo", "self_text": "I've always had a very strange relationship with sex since I was a young kid. I've always had an aversion towards it and I don't know why I had this before certain things happened. I vaguely remember certain aspects of my childhood that I felt uncomfortable and just have weird feelings about in regards to situations with some cousins of mine. I don't know if its normal things to happen and I'm overreacting but I just feel really weird about these situations. I'm going to talk a little about them and let me know whether you think about it.\n\n1. A first thing I remember that was alarming is when I was around 8 to 10 years old I remember my older female cousin kind of forcing me to watch porn with her. I never watched porn at the age and didn't care for it and felt really uncomfortable and weird that she was showing me and just watching it with a family member in general. Like she didn't touch me or herself even, like there wasn't any sexual behaviours alongside it but she just felt compelled to watch it with me when no one was home? idk? it was really strange and it changed the way I viewed that cousin since it happened and I distanced myself for the most part after that happened.\n2. So the same cousin also would go on online chat rooms when I was around and would essentially talk to guys (we were both underage, I was maybe... 10-12 years old around this time while she was about 13-15) sexually? Like she was essentially sexting them while I was there with her and would talk about it and try to get me to sext or whatever and I just felt weird about it too. I think at that age I thought we were being bad and wasn't extremely alarmed or uncomfortable but when I look back I just think it's weird.\n3. Same cousin. So from this side of this family there's two sets of twins, all older than me and I would hang out with them often and whatnot. They were all pretty sexual from what I remember, I remember them often talking about porn and sex and trying to get me to talk about it with them even though I was 3-4 years younger than them and nowhere near thinking or wanting sex. Let alone talking about it with family, I just feel really uncomfortable during these moments. I was around 11-12 years old again while they were all around 13-16 years old. I just thought it was also weird that they were so fixated on sexual things under 15 too but maybe it was just a difference in maturation? I just felt like they were trying to make me think or be sexual despite being young and not being there and idk.\n4. This moment is something that I don't remember well and even question whether my memory of it is accurate. I remember one time we were all hanging out when the parents were out and they were, again, talking about sex and whatnot and even talked about making out with eachother? I think they might have kissed eachother (two female cousins) or something and I think I remember someone asking if I wanted to kiss them? But I was super uncomfortable because they're my cousins and did NOT want to at all. I remember also distancing myself after this. Again, I have very blurry memory of this situation so I'm not entirely sure what happened exactly and I could be mis-remembering it but it's always been something I remembered frequently after alongside the other situations I mentioned earlier.\n\nI stopped hanging out with them when I was around 13 years old because I didn't like being around them and I started learning more about family drama from that side and frankly didn't want anything to do with them. They got into drugs, didn't really care for school anymore and some of them got pregnant super young and whatnot. I was more of a follow the rules, go to school, etc kind of kid during that time and thought they were terrible influences on top of hearing about an uncle on that side of the family actually molesting a couple cousins. That whole family has an issue with sexuality and after thinking back about how they acted I actually wonder if they were also groomed or assaulted by that same uncle and were that way around me because of it? Idk is it normal for cousins to talk about sex and porn with each other around that age? I just remember having an unsettling feeling about those times and I feel like I've held onto it for awhile. I don't mean that they were joking about it either or it was just curiosity it was more like seriously talking about it and whatnot. I wonder if I might be not remembering more things that may have happened that has made me feel super uncomfortable around them and never want to be around them again. I think I've talked to one or two of them maybe twice since 13 years old and I'm 23 now. My mom always wonders why I don't and I did recently tell her about the cousin making me watch porn and she was weirded out by it but I didn't mention the other things because I just feel uncomfortable about it and don't remember everything well. I could be overthinking and I definitely would never accuse them of anything if I don't have clear memories of it but I do have my suspicions. I have two younger cousins right now that are around 8-10 and I would NEVER talk about those things with them or show them porn at all, to be fair I am a lot older than my cousins were when they did those things but it's just so weird to think about doing those things with family? I would pissed off if I found out anyone made them watch porn with them or whatever. \n\nTLDR; are these situations that could hint towards sexual abuse or grooming? Do you also think that they may also have been abused sexually to explain these behaviours?\n\nEdit: idk if it makes a difference but I have no blood relation to these cousins. They are from my uncles side of family that married my blood related aunt. However, I saw them as family and cousins nonetheless.", "subreddit": "abuse"}

Although I did not think I deserved his abuse, I had many regrets about what he did not find good enough. I began dating a poly couple that reminded me of my marriage before it went so wrong. I wanted that chance to do many of the things I regretted not doing for my ex-husband before he totally went off the deep end. I've never made so many personal improvements or changed so much for anyone, but I'm sad to say it didn't matter.  Our ex was his first love, he excused and ignored every horrible thing she did that did not fit his vision of her. I had doubts, he talked me out of them, and so she preyed on both of us.\n\nWhen my exbf and I left our narcissistic partner, I thought we'd finally get a chance to be happy. I was so confident in our love and compatibility. It's still so hard to write, but without her, he completely changed.  He did gaslight and was abusive in the end. He threw things at me, told me things about myself that were not true, tried to convince me I was doing the same things he was doing as he was doing them, he called me pathetic and a quitter although I stayed at his side through 3 years of abuse at the hands of our ex. He would not listen and he alienated me because my emotions and my devotion were no longer helpful or convenient for him. After we left he reconnected with his estranged family she had isolated him from, he decided he didn't need me anymore, and discarded me. I miss his family so much, too.\n\nDuring and after the breakup I sent him many (so many-- like, 100s) angry messages about how hurt and used I felt. I am am still full of regrets about sending him the messages full of anger, although there is probably not much I said that was untrue or unfair. I reflect on how he ignored and complained about everything I was trying to tell him and feel guilt about the pain I caused fighting for one who didn't want to be fought for. I wish I had been able to be more patient and give him more time to regain his trust, but after putting up with her shit, I couldn't let it go when he told me lies.\n\nLosing him has effected me more than any of the objectively worse treatment I have endured. Since I saw him go through the same thing I went through with my ex-husband, I never thought he'd turn around and do any of the same kind of thing to me. I never thought he'd become incapable of apologizing, or expect me to read his mind, reduce me to my utility, or treat me as a burden. I thought he was the antithesis of all of those things I so badly needed a refuge from.\n\nI'm trying to eat, sleep, and seek medical help, but I feel so hopeless. I look around me and see a sick society just perpetuating the false hopes and stereotypes my narcs embraced. I want to break down every time I see represented the same kinds of lies and insecurities that my exes could not face within themselves and had to project on me instead. I feel so trapped and everywhere are well-meaning idiots and assholes alike each making the same promises they made and saying the same things they said.

I realize that a lot of people my age use Venmo for it's convenience but I really never needed to use it like that. Seeing as I usually just pay for myself when I go out.\n\nSo I go on my old Venmo account and the first person I see on the feed is my Nex. For those who don't know how Venmo works. It's a money sharing sight where you can send and receive money. It connects with your friends and is more of a social site than anything else. So there is a newsfeed outlining who is giving money to who. And you can put reasons in for sending or receiving money that everyone you are friends with can view. \n\nAnd I had my Venmo linked up to my Facebook. Even though I have my Nex blocked on facebook, there he was, all over my Venmo feed. So that's the accidental part of it all. \n\nMy doing was that I looked. And I was not suprised at what I found. During times that we were dating he was sending and receiving money to and from a lot of different girls for various reasons like going our drinking, going out to eat, rides and unidentified reasons. \n\nAnd this is all during the time frame that he specifically was accusing me of cheating all the time as well. \n\nWell, well, well.

He\u2019s always been very selfish and toxic. I apparently saw him as a project to fix. It\u2019s been 8 years, and all that\u2019s changed is his comfort with verbally abusing me. I know it\u2019s affecting our children. I have an 11 y/o from a previous marriage, and I know it affects him as well. I\u2019ve endured physical abuse, emotional and verbal abuse from 6 months in. Long before we ever had any children. we split up and I moved out in October of 2017. Within 3 weeks he had a new girlfriend. Told her specific flaws about my body, showed her videos from mental breakdowns, just all around smeared my name. Regardless, I tried and tried to get him just to come back to our daughter and I. Six months in, I move on. I ended up dating his ex best friend. They hadn\u2019t spoken in 5-6 years, but I still chose to keep it quiet, I didn\u2019t want him to think I was just seeing this guy to start trouble. I just desperately wanted to move on. Somehow, he catches wind of this. Loses his mind. \u201cBreaks up\u201d with his new girlfriend and tells me he made a terrible mistake giving our family up. This was May of 2018. He never broke up with the other woman, and I didn\u2019t find out until December  of 2018, the day after finding out I was pregnant with our second child. He told me he was sterile (this comes up later). He was leading a totally double life. I was shown proof from the other woman, as she didn\u2019t know he was carrying on a relationship with me as well. He was asking her to call my job and help get me fired, asking her to call CPS and falsely report that I was high on meth around our daughter, despite knowing I only smoke weed on the nights she\u2019s with her grandparents. He would come to my house to see my daughter and I. He\u2019d leave to go \u201cwork on his car\u201d, but instead would go pick this woman up. Because I was pregnant again, I tried to work through it. I believe he coerced me into getting pregnant. Obviously it takes two to tango, but he sat me down in tears one day telling me he was sterile. He cried because he\u2019d never get to have a son. When we\u2019d have sex, id tell him to pull out and he\u2019d say \u201cno eff that, I\u2019m going inside you\u201d. I remember very vividly one night we were having sex and he literally held me down and finished inside me, despite me asking him not to. He said \u201cwhere you gonna go now?\u201d And I gave him a \u201cwtf?\u201d look, he laughed and said \u201csterile remember?\u201d... well I end up pregnant. And because he told me the \u201csterile story\u201d, he would get angry and say the baby wasn\u2019t his. Even now, at 3 months old, if he gets mad at me, he refuses to help with her and says \u201cthat\u2019s not my f\u2014king baby\u201d. He gaslights me constantly. Physical abuse was reason enough to leave, but the idiot in me forgave it. Forgave getting staples in my head. Just to be told every day at least once \u201cI didn\u2019t say that\u201d, to the point where I\u2019ve began recording every phone call I have with him, not to provide proof to him, but for my sanity. He makes me legitimately feel insane each and every day. He badgers me for sex constantly. Then makes me feel guilty for not giving in. Every single day. Says I\u2019m not attracted to him, even if we had sex earlier that day. I got to the point where I was just doing it at least one time every single day, like a chore to shut him up for a few hours. Wondering if it\u2019s me. I have inherited very abusive traits since being with him, and I\u2019m scared I\u2019m just another abusive narcissist. I would never treat anyone the way I treat him. Is it possible I developed these tactics as a means of survival? I\u2019m not sure, but belittling and name calling just isn\u2019t who I am, but I\u2019m doing it constantly. To the point where I feel like this whole situation is my fault. Just last night he said \u201cdon\u2019t worry, I\u2019ll wake up with the baby tonight\u201d and when said baby woke up, he threw a fit because I expected him to get up with her. His words were \u201cI said that like seven hours ago. Why does everyone have to wake up to do a one man job?\u201d  Called me every name in the book. And something inside of me broke. As if everything else wasn\u2019t enough. I\u2019ve barely scratched the surface telling you all the things he\u2019s done to me. It\u2019s just like I realized that raising two kids with him is only giving me a third (him) kid to care for. My struggle here is, the \u201cfamily\u201d aspect. We have a 4 year old and a 3 month old. How can I move on from him with the kids in the picture? How do I ignore when he says \u201c8 years and 2 kids and you\u2019re going to throw it away because you\u2019re mad at something stupid?\u201d I\u2019ve already failed my kids by sticking with him for so long.. but I feel like leaving would also be failing them. I just need advice. Support. Anything. I\u2019ll answer any questions, as I know I may be missing important details.

It's the same person, but it feels like he is two persons. You never know which dad you'll deal with that day. The one part of dad is kind, caring and easy to talk to. The other one is terrifying, violent and hurtful. I don't know what to think of him anymore. When he is in a good mood just one thing can push him into being the angry furious dad.\n\nI don't know what to classify my dad as. I remember as a kid me and my little sister chatting in the backseat. Dad was in a bad mood. He screamed if you dont shut the fuck up I will stop the car and leave you two there. A few minutes pass and me and my sister started whispering instead. He didn't take it. He started driving fast as hell and turned on the radio on max until we got home. We had tinnitus hours after that.\n\nAt the same age mom and him had a fight, me and my sister hid in my room while they screamed and glasses were thrown at eachother. This was normal but still horrifying for us. Dad removed the outside door so we couldn't leave the house without risking someone walking in, and left for work. Mom left anyway and took us to a women's protection shelter. I have no idea for how long we stayed. Most of these memories I've suppressed because they are basically the same. Dad fighting with mom, breaking things or when mom was at work he would scream at us and threaten us. I always protected my sister because it was her my dad often went for.\n\nOnce he burnt my sister with hot water, he has yelled horrible things at us and pushed me into a table. Once I had to break up him from yelling and throwing things at my sister that I stabbed myself in the leg so he had to take me to the ER instead of terrorizing my sister. Of course I got hell for that, but I'd rather take it then let my sister have to take it.\n\nThrowing and breaking things isn't the worst things, but it's the way he screams, the things he screams and how fast he can snap from being the nice dad to being the other dad. You always gotta be careful around him. Last time there was a huge family fight, bigger than normal. Things broke and to make things short he was about to do something to mom, I went between and defended her and some punches were thrown between us. And I spat in his face. That was the cherry on top. He absolutely lost it. I can take if he starts fighting me, but not my mom or sister.\n\nBut I don't know what to do. He's a fantastic dad if you look away from all these things. Supportive, super friendly. Everyone likes him. I don't know how to deal with this. He is like two persons and as I know he is abusive he isn't like that all the time. I don't know if I should report him to the police. I don't want to, I love my dad. But at the same time this isn't right. I hate this. As soon as I'm financially stable I'm leaving this hell hole. My sister who is under 18 is going to stay with mom.\n\nI did wrong to get violent, and I hated that so much. I never want to do that again. I'm never going to be like him. I'm going to go to therapy to manage my anger I've built up over the years so this won't happen again. I will NOT EVER become like him. That my worst fear \n\nDear dad. You'll never read this. I love you, but it's very hard to do that. I don't know what kind of childhood you had, but you've scarred my sister and me for life. We will have a hard time trusting men, always asking ourselves if what you've done is justified. But now I've seen through you. Even though you say it won't happen again you let it happen. Again and again. If you loved us you wouldn't do this to us. I have conflicted feelings about you. On one hand I never want to see you again but on the other hand I love you and don't want to break our contact. But I can't ever forgive you for what you've done to my mom and sister.\n\nTL;DR: dad is unstable. One second he is a great dad, the next he is terrifying, screaming and breaking things. He have abused me and my mom and sister ever since I can remember. Me and my sister and mom went to a protection home. The fights escalates the older we get and last time it got violent.

He has cameras in both of our cars watching us to listen to our conversations, and he used to have them inside the house (I think there is still one in the living room) and we have them outside too. My mom is not allowed to go shopping or leave the house without his permission and she cannot spend money over a certain budget that he creates. He has rage fits quite often and will slam the doors and walls and bang furniture. He also is very bipolar and has OCD and will rapidly change moods.

Right now he is complaining that he spends too much money on me and my siblings for Christmas, but I did not even ask for a single thing yet.

Honestly I've been feeling like quite the coward.\n\nSince last update, I've packed a \"bug out bag\" and have it stashed in my apartment garage. I've also got dog food stored there. This is done in case she won't go away when we split. I'll be able to have clothes and keep my dog fed. I also got her a new service training harness that's in my apartment garage. That way I can still take her in stores with me if we have to disappear for a few days after breakup.\n\nNow for the coward part...\n\nWe were supposed to leave for Thanksgiving trip to see her family (and have Christmas with them) Tuesday night. On Monday she went into a rage yelling at me because of how I worded something (\"come back here and I will help you load the car\" versus \"come back here and I will load the car\"). I couldn't work up the nerve to walk away when it was happening. I tried 3 different times, but I couldn't make myself do it.\n\nTuesday morning we had it out. I told her she was emotionally abusive (even though I know I'm not supposed to). She got all serious and apologized for the outburst Monday. It was honestly the first time I've ever heard her apologize for anything. I told her we were done, and then she worked me back in to going to her parents' house anyway. Again, coward.\n\nWe had a good time with her family. I really like them, and they really like me, so there wasn't any weird tension or anything. She changed the passcode on her phone \"just to make it something different\" for the first time in 3 years, so I suspect she's been chatting with her BFF about us. I didn't push it with the passcode...just said \"oh, whatever.\" She doesn't know my current phone passcode (work requires I change it frequently), so I didn't push the issue.\n\nShe's been posting stuff online trying to get attention. Today she posted some image that said just because someone carries it well doesn't mean it isn't heavy. Yesterday was something about sleep doesn't help when it's your soul that's tired. I haven't commented on any of this type of stuff (online or in person).\n\nIn our discussion Tuesday, when she wasn't accepting the breakup, I told her that she's wasting her time with me. In order for us to get married, I have to find a job that give me about a 50% pay increase. (Either that or she has to go get a job, but she's obviously not considering that option.) Given that I'm near the top of my range already, a raise that substantial, even when changing jobs, is not likely. She has 3 years alimony remaining, and then she has to figure out what she's going to do with herself. I told her the raise wasn't going to happen, and she's going to end up in a position where she has zero income at all. That didn't budge her, but I don't know why. She just said I can't know for sure that I won't get a huge raise with another job; I agreed but told her the likelihood is very, very slim. She didn't seem to care, like it's a problem for another day or something.\n\nAnyway, right now I'm fighting feeling like quite the coward over this. I've moved almost everything out of her garage that I can, but I got a bunch of orders for Christmas gifts over the weekend, so my woodworking needs to keep moving forward. I can't afford to leave it unused in my apartment garage for any amount of time.\n\nMy next steps...I don't know. We've made tentative plans to go see my family at Christmas, so unless it all hits the fan before then I don't know what will change.

There is no way, why would you even say that!\n\nIt\u2019s my own fault for wanting to get what I experienced written down, I have it in journals and memories, but I wanted HIM to know.

It felt so good to hear him say \u201cwhen you laugh I love you so much\u201d and to see the messages about \u201creconciliation\u201d. I have never brought it up, it just makes me feel good that he is \u201cthinking\u201d about me. In whatever weird shitty way he can...it just means it meant something. And even if it didn\u2019t, the fact that he is thinking \u201creconciliation\u201d and I am not...that helps me feel stronger \n\nI know I have a lot of healing and self care to work on, but damn, that made me feel good.

I have been gas lighted so long. AND KNEW IT BUT IGNORED IT.

She\u2019s gay, I\u2019m straight. \nI could type a freaking novel all of the things she has done to me but I\u2019m going to ATTEMPT to water it down to the main things.\n\n1. She\u2019s an energy vampire, she has to talk constantly. Good luck watching a movie with her or trying to have a conversation with her.. bc she\u2019s dictating it. \n\n2. She knows everything. Fuck your opinion, what she says is the only way to go! You can speak your view point and how you feel, and totally disregards it and says what you should do. Has an explanation for everything. \n\n3. Does not respect boundaries. You tell her not to touch your thermostat in YOUR house and she does anyways. You tell her you don\u2019t feel like hanging out, she shows up anyways and knocks on your door pretending to never have gotten your text that said \u201cI don\u2019t feel like hanging out\u201d.... she doesn\u2019t roll down  or crack her window when she decides to light a cigarette in my car. She shuts doors to rooms I tell her not to shut bc my cat uses them. \n\n4. She\u2019s always broke\n\n5. She is constantly the victim. (Mind you, she\u2019s 35 living with her mom and son (who her mother raised), she worked at Arby\u2019s but got fired, she has a suspended license, she alwayssss has a tall beer in her hand, she smokes cigarettes too much.  She\u2019s never attempted anything in life other than conning people, using people, and working restaurants)\n\n6. She makes non Challant insults towards me.. I am slightly knock kneed so my shoes wear out loosely faster than other people, so she always has to talk about peoples shoes \u201chitch hiking\u201d or leaning... I also have flat feet that look wide when I stand, so she makes the comment about \u201clet\u2019s watch shrek 2 with Fiona\u201d.. but I remember one time awhile back she said my feet look like fionas... idk guys, it\u2019s just comments narcissist make that you may not catch on to buy they\u2019re shady!\n\n7. She\u2019s clingy, she does not respect boundaries once again. There\u2019s been several times I did not agree with her and was tired of her behaviors and would ask her to leave or get out of my house and she would just sit or stand there. If I tried moving her she would still stand there. I could push her 5 feet away and she\u2019d go right back to the spot she was in... if I say get out of my house, get out of my house!!! \n\n8. We\u2019ve had physical altercations because of her not getting out or leaving my house or car. \n\n9. She lives 4 streets over so I\u2019ve seen her numerous times riding by slow to see if my cars home. \n\n10. If you call her out or even try to speak to her like an adult about what she\u2019s doing. She somehow either plays Victim and makes you feel crazy or either she projects it back on you. \n\nAt this point I want absolutely nothing to do with her. But have not told her.

Caution.", "author": "changenme", "self_text": "I had never heard of a covert narcissist. I have to admit I was clueless. \n\nMy husband of 15 years. He was my hero then. I never snooped. I always forgave. He lied a lot. I believed in him and our marriage.  I believed in us. I used to say \" he makes my sun rise and sun set.\" \n\nSummary:\nThis July on my birthday. I found out about his affair. \nMy world ended. I told him get out. He convinced me to work on our marriage etc. \n\nBy Sept.  I saw no change. He still denied. Still lied. Really insulted my intelligence . ( he got away with it before, so why not now?)  I disassociated from the relationship. I cut his supply off !  He would not leave. \nOn the 14th. He drove so aggressive.  He almost put the horse trailer in ditch. He would not slow down. So I started video taping him. He threw my phone out the window. Screamed at me \" I did not cheat\". My reply  I threw my 32 oz. Pepsi at him .I said \" it's a felony to toss my phone out. Better go back and find it.\" He tried kicking me out of truck. Nope it's in my name . \nGot my phone, broken of course.  Got home. Got the silent treatment. I went to bed. \nThe 15th. \nHe yanks pillows out from under my head. Screams \" I did not cheat\" My reply \" liar. You murdered your marriage and a part of me. I hate you. You make me sick. \"\nHe got up and went outside.\nA little bit later . I went to feed my horses. I opened the door to find my husband had taken his own life. He hung himself . Facing me . Eye level.  I first thought.. that's a sick joke and slapped him. Realizing it was no joke. I ran got a knife. Cut him down. Dropped him. I could not catch him. Split his eyebrow open. Started cpr. Ran to get a phone. Mine was broken. Found his. Couldn't run his. Returned to CPR. Tried calling again. A friend pulled up. Her husband called 911. She started compressions. I did breathes.  I could not get a good seal.  He had thrown up. Anyway. Sherriffs came then ambulance. \nThey worked on him 30 min or so. They got heart started. Took him to hospital. Flew him to trauma center. He was dead when I opened the door on sunday. They pronounced him on Tues. Turned off machines on sat. I lost him 3x. They turned him off on sat because I allowed him to be an organ donor. \nThey took all but lungs and pancreas. He could help up to 50 people they said. \nAnyway. That's when I learned about a covert narcissist. My counselor counted off the top of his head 7 traumas in a short period. My husband was a textbook narc. His suicide I was told was a spiteful suicide. \nMy life was an illusion he created. I was unaware of. He murdered his marriage by his actions. I fulfilled my end of the marriage. He failed his. I lost everything I thought was real in a blink of a lie. Talk about a shock to the system !\nHe had no insurance. He left me 2 months behind in bills.$11.  The hospital Bill's for 6 days ICU. Well let's just say they scare me. I am financially ruined. \n\nMy brain now misfires. I cant Express thoughts easily anymore. I have panic attacks . He destroyed me. My soul feels like it is hiding. Etc  My memory is disappearing. \n\nDaily I find letters from women. #s. Porn strippers etc. I have a waiting list for pain. \nI use his phone. Women text from sex dating sites. On Thanksgiving. \n\nHe couldn't lift a finger for me. But would move mountains for others. \n\nI am so full of hate. It is the only feeling I know right now. Counselor says too much hate is pushing my memories out to make room. \n\nI do not miss him. I have not dealt with his death. \nI'm still swimming in the lies, deceit  and betrayals.\n\nI see his face everywhere.  Especially in the security camera monitor. Counselor says it's due to lack of closure. No where to point my anger. \n\nHis girlfriend calls says she is pregnant. \n\nI lost so much weight. I dont sleep. \n\nBut I will survive !!!\nHe took his own life to punish me. I refuse the punishment. His actions murdered our marriage. Murdered him and a part of me.  \nI did my part . He failed. \n\nDont get me wrong. He took me to my knees. I am in process of brushing my knees off and standing back up. Tall and confident and alive ! He made me a nobody. One day he will be less than a memory to me. \n\nI will be changed. I will make sure it's a change for the better. Not the worse.  He does not get to change my heart. Like he said it should be changed. \nI made him an organ donor. So hopefully others can live a good decent life. \n\nHe can keep his punishment. I dont want it.

He would constantly talk about me coming to visit him a few weeks before he was leaving, and he would talk about things we would do together when I got there, but I knew they were all empty promises, and deep down I didnt want them fulfilled anyways. \n\nA day or two before he left, we made plans to see eachother the day of and of course that never happened. He ended up texting me before he boarded his plane and told me, \"I just couldnt stomach seeing you to say goodbye in person. I've had an emotional morning with my family. It would have been too much.\" I was upset at first, then angry. It was too much? We had been together almost every damn day for a year and he put me through so much again, but I didnt deserve a goodbye...? I was almost happy he didnt, looking back, because it did really show me how much he \"cared.\" He had used me and I had let it happen, again, and now that we were going to be living in completely different provinces, I was no use to him anymore. \n\nFast forward to now, and it's been hard.

So I'm going to do the same.\" So, that's what I did. I'm feeling so fucking stupid about it... We ended up talking for a few days but it went nothing past \"sexting\" really and he had brought up the fact he was coming to visit this month for Christmas, but I just ignored that when he told me. I didnt want to give him any satisfaction - I was trying to be a \"tease\" and talk some shit, and I thought it was working in my favor, but now I just feel like a fool because of it all. \n\nI feel like the Narcissist today. I have been hoovering his social media, havent I? I have hoovered him over text, etc now, right? Because that's exactly what it looks like to me... I've never been angrier with myself.

I was always taught to never speak to men or boys, which is why i can't form any friendship or relationship till this day. he always threatened me that he will beat me up after my mom left the house so I dread the time waiting hiding in my room. I'm diagnosed with depression and anxiety. MY mental health is at it lowest. my school schedule was from 8 to 12 and then come back from 14 to 18, he didn't allow me to change my clothes even if i had my period or smelled funny, i wasn't allowed to close the door, he even tipped his friends to keep an eye on me in front of school, he beat me up once because i stole from him a peanut, out of my instincts i protected myself and hit back, i remember him saying \"how dare you you protect yourself\" i ended up with a bruised lip and due to him hitting me on my stomach i didn't have my period for a month or two. My mom was working at that time and my father was at his sister house. keep in mind that he is 7 years older than me. he once trapped me between the wall and my bed and he just kept going and going and going. It's embarrassing to say but every time he beat me up I pee myself till this day. he also abused me mentally when I fail a class, calling me stupid, he tried to get me to drop out of school as well (which i did after not passing senior year). in high school, a guy liked me and out of fear i told him to ask my brother for permission if we can go out, the poor guy got beat up in from of school,never to speak to me again. the last beat up i got was him getting home drunk before getting married by three months and beat me up repeatedly almost killing me in the process, it was i took a picture in PE with then my best friend and he put his hand on my shoulder, he called me a slut and spit on me. fast forward to now, he's not home often so i'm glad but yesterday  he accused me of following another religion and threatened me. this abuse had a major impact on my life, i signed up to the gym (he always calls me fat) and went one time with him and my sister in law but the moment a coach talked to me i left for the bathroom fearing that i will get beat up at home and the coach, even going back twice i couldn't speak to the coach only by nodding and I didn't return since (November 2018). I can't speak to anyone and I can't physically bring myself to leave the house, I'm afraid of everything that surrounds me.\n\n(my mom try to protect me but she can't do anything) I'm not here for help, i'm here to vent my heart out and thank you for letting me", "subreddit": "abuse"}

{"post_id": "e5jopc", "created_utc": 1575391122, "title": "This narc could have a Lifetime movie based off her life", "author": "graveyard_woman", "self_text": "We live in a small city that thrives on gossip. A few years ago, some people we knew came across Narc's profile on several sugar baby websites. I'm frankly unsure how she expected to keep this entrepreneurial endeavor under-wraps in a city where everyone knows everyone, but I digress. I also want to make it clear: I have no problem with sex work to earn a living. And if you want to lie about it, that's your business. But, my friends and I all had a good laugh looking at these screen shots being sent around because of the creepy, weird way Narc talks about herself and her sugar daddy prospects.\n\nAND we all assumed her current partner had no idea about this, which was amusing, because he's \\*almost\\* as vile and abusive as she is. He cosigns on her narcissistic lies and behavior, and has no idea he's been supporting and defending someone who has been essentially cheating on him. He's meek, very awkward, kind of creepy and desperate, doesn't really have any friends -- a perfect target for a Narc to overpower. So, sometimes I feel bad for him, knowing he is likely experiencing the most abuse of all, but then I remember all the horrendous things he's said and done to women for his Narc-partner and I do not feel bad at all. I do wonder, however, how she explained earning so much money being completely unemployed.\n\nAdditionally, as nothing on Reddit is ever truly deleted, we all looked at her Reddit profile and discovered she'd been posting about (and has since \"deleted,\" but the content is still visible on Removeddit) several sugar daddy encounters and experiences in sugar baby subs for months, all while engaged to her current spouse.\n\nFast forward to about a month ago, out of the blue, Narc starts messaging people we know and posting on social media that my friends, partner, and I (using our full names) made these \"fake\" sugar baby profiles to mess with her? I guess this has happened because word that she is a sex worker finally made its way back to her spouse? And instead of coming clean and fixing her marriage, a true narc can never admit to a lie. She instead blames the peoples she's been stalking, harassing, and victimizing for YEARS. That makes sense. I don't know how to get on sugar baby websites (I think you have to pay for some of them), I don't talk like she does, I don't view sex work negatively, I don't have time for any of that, I have a life, friends, family, and a career; she does not. She not only blamed us to her spouse, she also proceeded to harass and engage in yet another public and humiliating smear campaign against us.\n\nOne of the tools of manipulation my narc LOVES to use is triangulation. It wasn't until I connected with an ex of hers, and we began exchanging screen shots of her behavior, that we both discovered all of the many horrendous lies she'd been telling to several different parties. So in this situation, at some point it was discovered that she replaced all of her own photos on one sugar baby profile with the photos of a woman much younger and more attractive than she is. I had no idea who this girl was, I thought she was some Instagram model from across the country or something. The girl in the photos actually reached out to me! Narc had been messaging this poor girl nonstop, begging her to call her OWN SPOUSE and tell him that I was the one who created the sugar baby profiles, not Narc. When the girl refused, Narc's spouse began barraging this girl with messages, calling her \"crazy.\"\n\nWhat is wrong with these people? Why does this narc feel the need to involve dozens of people in her lies? Why does every negative occurrence in her life somehow end up as my fault? Why does her spouse enable her? Does it not grow tiresome? Wouldn't it be easier to have an honest relationship with your partner and leave your victims ALONE? It's infuriating, because I have truly done NOTHING to her. I never have. She slept with my now-partner a handful of times YEARS AGO and has now become utterly obsessed with the two of us since. I wish I could understand or explain why.\n\nIt seems like she's lost her touch with her word salad though -- when people sent me the screen shots of her MANY lengthy posts about me, her \"explanation\" of how I did this, with a \"team\" of \"hackers\" who have been \"following\" her was so far-fetched and out of left field that no one really believed her whatsoever. She sounded like a person truly unhinged. She always has a myriad of explanation for her lies, I'll give her that. I guess doing literally nothing but stalking people all day gives her a lot of free time to get creative.\n\nOne of the Narc's many flaws is that they will give you a LOT of evidence to work with. She will write literal essays, multi-paragraph messages to people, full of lies and inconsistencies and will attempt to essentially blackmail us to prevent us from sharing them with anyone that might disprove her BS. The girl in the photos and I exchanged all the screen shots we could, and she finally began to realize that she was involuntarily forced into a narcissistic hell.\n\nWhen Narc first began harassing and smearing me, everyone told me to ignore her; people will see the truth one day. One day, she'll harass enough people that everyone will see her for the abusive bully she is. \"One day\" felt so far away. I was so confused, hurt, and angry at her and the people who believed her insane lies about me. But I kept ignoring and still do. And her internet \"friends\" slowly trickled away, after witnessing how much of a lunatic she is over time. And all the women she's chosen to harass and bully have connected with one another.\n\nNow, not a soul will associate with her, and many of her \"supporters\" actually reached out to apologize to me. Many people have fessed up to entertaning her only out of fear and/or entertainment, which I don't agree with -- giving a narc any attention is detrimental to their victims. Women I connected with over narcissistic abuse rallied around me and I didn't feel so alone and rejected any longer. And she has no one, not even her own partner. She attempted to ruin me, and ruined herself.", "subreddit": "NarcissisticAbuse"}

Before I get into this I want to describe how I am. I am 100% honest, I don't like to exaggerate, and I don't want sympathy, I think. \n\n I'm 30M. I was physically and verbally abused starting around 5 by my sociopathic father. The simplest way I can describe what I feel his motives were is how Michael Jacksons father may have been towards him.\nThe abuse was countless and the things he said to me almost seems fake regarding my age. I will jump around alot and I'm sorry but you might be able to piece the events in my timeline.\n\nI'm going to share two specific abusive memories of him that keeps popping into my head. It will also be easier to understand stating that I have never once felt protected around my father.\nWhen I was a child I almost never spoke and I loved Pokemon, I was 11 and I was going to miss an episode because my father wanted to take me and my brother to the mall. I got teary eyed knowing I was going to miss it but I kept my head down however my father noticed while I was walking to the car. I was lifted by my ear and thrown to the ground. When I got up I was vocally crying and he proceeded open palm strike my legs while yelling at me \" Stop being weak, if you keep crying I'm going to keep hitting you til you stop!\". I had images of other children scraping their knees, crying and having their parents come to aid them and I'm here being hit for being a weak child. He kept hitting me until I made completely no sound with a straight face. It was finally during this moment that I decided everything is my fault. Then I got into the truck and we went to the mall.\n\nParents divorced the same year, me and brother moved from NC to MA with our mother. From 11 til 16 I was suicidal and had panic attacks everyday but kept that away from everyone. My brother moved to TX with my father because he was out of control. My older brother was the light of my life. He was the only person in my life that has never tried to oppress me. When he moved I made a suicide note and I partially stabbed my stomache, bled but nothing fatal. Knowing I was getting closer I decided before I go I try one more time. I called my father, told him I was depressed and wanted to move down to see my brother.\n\nI move down and that whole year from 16 to 17 was hell, as expected. My brother was becoming suicidal from our father making us work 60+ hours a week at his resturaunt. One night I overheard my father and his wife talking to my brother in the kitchen, they were saying I was manipulating him and was the reason he's becoming sad. I didn't have the heart then to know that was a lie. I stupidly blamed myself somehow and the next day we usually played soccer but I told my father I wanted to move back north. He took offense to this and said \"You fat fuck, go back to MA and fucking die, you're stupid and useless!.\" No one knew I overheard them last night and he thought I was trying to avoid soccer, and I didn't tell my brother til much later in life. Me and my brother was saying our goodbyes in our room until my father ran up behind me and kicked the back of my head(we're all athletic). I fell on my bed facedown and he proceeded to mount my back and punch the back of my head the same way you see them do in cage fighting except in cage fighting it's illegal. My brother had to pull him off or he was never going to stop my brother claimed. \n\nThe year with my brother inspired me to become a normal person so I went and learned how to do things like speak to strangers etc, literal work from the ground up. I eventually became the most charismatic and empathetic person I know but I still struggled. I was going to off myself last year at 29 until I involuntarily cured my depression from a shroom trip. I'm not here to advocate that type of thing but it happened. No more self hate.\n\nNow I'm born again however I still am very hard on myself and there is still something I want to get off my chest but that's another time here.

However, over thanksgiving vacation he told me how they met and what's going on. She was not present at holidays and didnt want to see us after.\n\nInitially Rose asked if he was interested in her. He said she was pretty but he was not ready for a relationship.\nShe responded to this by saying he thought she was ugly and must be interested in someone else.\nNot wanting to make her sad he said that wasn't the case and she was pretty. She kissed him and said they should date and he said okay.\n\nMy brother is also a devout and practicing Christian and wants to wait until marriage until being intimate with someone. He told me he is rebuffing her advances but she keeps trying to get him to sleep with her or do things he isn't comfortable with, arguing with him that it was fine if they just pushed a little further.\nI told him that regardless of your religious viewpoints, no means no and consent matters to both parties. Literally \"I'm not Christian and no still means no. That is wrong.\"\nHes torn because he says no and it usually means she cries and leaves or gets angry.\n\nImmediately after Thanksgiving, Rose \"rapid fire\" texted my brother demanding he come back to the campus and to take her to the malls for Black Friday. He left in a panic not wanting to make her angry.\nMy mother has access to his bank accounts due to him being conned before and saw he was spending money left and right but when asked he said he got nothing for himself. \n\nWhen we first brought up her behavior, he listened. But now he talks to us less and less and I fear Rose is isolating and controlling him. Everytime we try to check in and ask if hes okay and to tell us hes alive and well he doesnt respond for a day or more. When we do get responses, we get extremely vague answers. We want to give him his independence and room to grow relationships but how do we approach this without losing my brother??\nHe is absolutely not the type of person to be able to breakup with someone even if he feels wronged.\n\nTl;dr: I think my autistic brothers gf is manipulative and possibly abusive due to the stories my brother has told me. My family hears from him less and less and we are extremely worried. How do we fix this situation??", "subreddit": "abuse"}

Let me preface this by saying that i\u2019m writing this to find out if i am overreacting or not. I (18F) have had four times where i felt i\u2019d been assaulted. they range from being groped in the back of a car to being held down by my neck by my prom date while he did what he pleased to me (i would also like to add that i have never been raped and am a virgin, when speaking in terms of penetration and my only \u201cgood\u201d sexual experience was over a year ago when both of us were drunk).  \n\nNow i need to give some backstory to the situation in question. I\u2019m a freshman in college and since day one i\u2019ve had this weird flirtatious friendship with a boy (18M) in my dorm building. he\u2019s kind of been my weakness all year, despite everyone around me (my friends, even his friends) telling me that he is, basically, a shitty person.  \n\nHe was clearly at least a little interested in me and a few weeks into school, i told him that i was into him but wasn\u2019t sure what to do about it since we lived in the building, have classes together etc. We agreed to let it go since there was too much potential awkwardness if we didn\u2019t last, and we left it at that but still continued this flirty friendship. \n\nBetween then and now, there have been a few times where he drunkenly asked for a hookup, which i said no to each time. finally, flash forward to exactly a week ago, he asked if he could come over since my roommate had already left for thanksgiving break. i said no, because i didn\u2019t want to hook up with him. I MADE THAT CLEAR. despite part of me definitely wanting to, i\u2019m still trying to recover from the prom date assault, that one really fucked me up for a long time (it happened 1.5 years ago). i just didn\u2019t trust this boy enough to lose my virginity to him, and i knew that that\u2019s what it would have led to if i said yes to a hookup. i hope that made sense, i\u2019m getting a bit scatterbrained writing this all out. it\u2019s hard to put into words. \n\nanyway, he (still over text) told me that he just wanted to cuddle and that he would never do anything to make me uncomfortable. i\u2019d also like to add that he knows i\u2019m a virgin, he knows i\u2019m not super comfortable with intimacy, and HE KNOWS I HAD BEEN ASSAULTED MULTIPLE TIMES. \n\nhe eventually convinced me to let him come over with the one rule that nothing would happen between us. this is where it gets graphic, so be warned. \n\nhe came over, and immediately started kissing me. i was hesitant at first but eventually became okay with it because, hey, i\u2019ve been a little interested in this boy since moving here right? \n\nafter moving to my bed, he started getting handsy and putting his hand under my shirt despite my trying to move his hand away multiple times. after he kept trying, i explicitly told him that i didn\u2019t want that and that i might just want to fall asleep. he says okay and pretends to fall asleep. \n\nafter about 30 seconds of silence, he tries to put his hand down my pants until i sit up and tell him \u201ccan you please just stop?\u201d \n\nhe looked super offended and shocked and says  \u201cyou know i\u2019m not going to touch anything bad, i just like feeling your skin\u201d or something like that. i told him that i don\u2019t fucking care and just let me sleep please. but when i lay back down he started to play with my underwear between his fingers and when i tensed up he told me again that he promised he wouldn\u2019t do anything, just to let him feel my skin. \n\nso i did because i figured there was no point arguing. i should\u2019ve just kicked him out then. \n\nas he was still playing with my underwear, he said a few times (and i\u2019m so sorry you have to read this) \u201ci know you don\u2019t want to, but i could make you feel so good right now if you let me go down\u201d\n\nthe first time he said this, i told him no and that i couldn\u2019t stop thinking about my past experiences at this point. \n\nthe second time he said this, he turned me back over and started kissing me again, more forcefully. this is when i told him to leave. \n\nit took a few tries, but after raising my voice at him and saying that he was being pushy and making me uncomfortable, he finally went back to his room, but not before pulling me in to kiss me again before he left. \n\ni texted him the next morning and told him that he made me so uncomfortable and he said he was sorry and that was that. \n\nthis is the part where i ask, am i overreacting? i had a class with him less than an hour ago and it was the first time i had seen him since he was in my room. i thought i would be fine, especially since i have two of my best friends in that class (both male, both hate this boy) to keep me distracted, but it felt like i was being suffocated around him. i really didn\u2019t think it would affect me this much, i\u2019m not upset or torn up about it all, just kinda mad. \n\nbut in class today, i got the same kind of anxiety that i felt whenever i saw my prom date after the night he assaulted me, like i was about to cry and vomit at the same time. \n\nbut i\u2019m not sure why i\u2019m feeling like that? i left my class because i felt like i just could not be around him any more. when i looked at him, i felt pure disgust and horror. \n\nam i overreacting? i just feel so lost.", "subreddit": "survivorsofabuse"}

I couldn\u2019t figure out how they get us to miss them, but then it clicked. \n\nIn the beginning, we are perfect, and they present a false self that is everything we ever wanted. They shower us with affection, we are the same person, they are our soulmate. \n\nThey get tired of pretending eventually and show themselves. Not understanding what is happening, we speak up. This is when they turn it on us. We are hurting our relationship, ruining the perfect future they promised us. \n\nThis continues. They act out and we speak up and are met with anger and the blame is shifted to us. We are the problem. They continue this until they say that all we do is complain and criticize, we are ruining the relationship. \n\nWe start to doubt ourselves. We have been complaining a lot, we do make them mad, they used to love us before, we must be doing something wrong. \n\nOnce we begin to apologize, and take the blame, they treat us with disdain and disgust. We are the bad guys, and they treat us as such. \n\nWe doubt ourselves, feel like we made the mess we are in, and we try hard to fix it. We want to make them happy again, we want to erase everything we did to push them away. We keep quiet and try harder to please them. \n\nWe seek their approval. When we are good, they tell us that we are beautiful and perfect. When we are bad, and mention their behavior, we are punished. We work hard to make them happy and our survival depends on their opinion of us. \n\nSome of us get sick of it and break up with them. So they send the perfect soulmate in to smooth things over. They\u2019re back! We are so relieved that the person we fell in love with is still in there that we stay and give it another chance. \n\nAnd the cycle starts over and repeats until one day we can\u2019t take it anymore. The once beautiful, kind, loving person that we were only exists when we are good and we get rewarded. When we are bad, we are monsters who deserve to be punished. We no longer have a sense of self because they convince us falsely that who we are depends on how they see us. \n\nWhen we finally do leave, we are making them so unhappy that we punish ourselves. We leave, not as the beautiful person we came in as, but as the ugly one they told us we were. \n\nWe feel broken and unsure of ourselves. We ruined the relationship with our soul mate, we must be the monster. Without the narcissist in our lives to tell us we are good, we feel bad. We seek approval from others because we no longer trust ourselves. \n\nWe are alone, and they have moved on, happy with a new supply, their real soulmate. We are a disappointment, self-loathing and depressed. We either jump right into bed with another narcissist (the only ones who can give that soulmate feeling from day one), or we are scared to move on for fear of what we have become.\n\nWe miss them because they have convinced us that their opinion of us matters more than our own. Our self-worth is based on their words, not our own. \n\nIf I\u2019m right about this, all we have to do to get over them is make our opinion of ourselves the important one. Toss out anything they told us, tricked us into believing. We are still the perfect person we once were, and we don\u2019t need them to tell us.

I'm new here, and for the past few weeks I've been coming to terms with ending a five year on again off again relationship with my nex. I have a lot of down time at work and find myself staring into space replaying every moment between he and I. When my family and friends would ask me, what is it about him that's so special? Or even when I would ask myself, one thing I would always say is, \"no one understands me like M. No one loves me the way he does\".  And for the longest time I thought that to be true. Throughout these five years I've dated other people when we were off, and always felt that \"something was missing\". While I don't think anyone else I've dated was truly the right person for me, the truth is I was comparing the love they were giving me to that of a mentally ill person. Yes, nobody loved me the way my narc loved me, because THAT WASN'T REAL LOVE. That was love bombing. The gifts, the long texts, the promises, the romantic touches, the flowers sent to my job, the pda, the notes, the dramatic gestures and proclamations of how we complete each other, long winded narratives of what our future will be, I could go on and on really...but all of the things that I felt made him so special were really just signs of a mentally ill person, (subconsciously or not) manipulating me into what was to eventually become the codependent narc/empathe relationship. I am trying my best to look at the situation from outside myself and my own emotions. Nobody in their right mind would act the way he acted so early on in a relationship, and to the extent that he did. But because it felt so damn good, and it was such a high, and you feel like you're finally living out every romantic movie you've ever seen in your life, and you really believe that this is the guy for you and you have to jump on the train because he's right- all this time the universe was just guiding us towards each other.....because the feeling of that fake love was so intense, it's almost like everything else pales in comparison. I hope one day, very far down the road I will be ready to date again and hopefully meet someone and have a family.

When I heard the word abuse I immediately thought physical abuse. I had no idea about the world I was about to enter 8 years ago. Mental abuse will consume your entire life, your entire being, you will lose that spark that you once had. I would hear the word psychopath or sociopath and think of a serial killer. Took me 8 years to figure out that they live all around us. Manipulation was never a word that crossed my mind, it was never a word I thought about. I was 22 years old when I fell victim to his abuse. It didn\u2019t start out as abuse because it never does. At first he was the sweetest boy I\u2019d ever met. He loved me like no one ever had. Bought me flowers, made me cards, bought me gifts constantly. He fell for me hard, I was a little more reserved as I wasn\u2019t used to such love bombing but I ignored the red flags. After the months went by more and more red flags were popping up. I got warned by his ex but I chose to believe his story of \u201cshe\u2019s insane and obsessed with me\u201d I always knew in the back of my mind that it was him. He became possessive and jealous. I hated that about him most so I would constantly break up with him but he would somehow swindle his way back into my life with his love bombing and handmade cards. At some point he brainwashed me. \u201cHow could anyone else ever love me this much.\u201d I think back now and laugh at what an idiot I was. Abuse comes in all forms even when you don\u2019t know your being abused. He cheated, lied, was aggressive, threatened me. And I stuck by him and dealt with it. Always thinking it\u2019ll get better one day, he\u2019ll get better. People like that don\u2019t get better, they are sick and 9 times out of 10 they don\u2019t want help. I ended up getting pregnant and had a beautiful girl. I moved in with him and it was a pretty horrible 4 years of living together. He was incredibly possessive, jealous and manipulative. I felt like a prisoner in my own skin. He ended up leaving for a sober home due to his other issues he has. He was there for a month and I caught him cheating on me. When I found out I was of course so angry but the little spark that was left of me was partially relived that it was finally over. I now had a reason I could leave him, if only it were that easy. Of course his relationship went super fast paced because that\u2019s how abusive people are calculated. They move onto their next victim before ever leaving their last victim. Every week or two throughout the entire year I would receive calls, texts, or him showing up confessing his love for me. Did I fall for it? Yes the first few times he did it I did fall for it. He claimed he was better now and he\u2019d done the work on himself and has always loved me. I believed him. It doesn\u2019t take long to realize he hadn\u2019t changed at all and was still the same manipulative psycho. Everytime I wouldn\u2019t give him the attention he needed he\u2019d go back to his girlfriend. Moving on was the hardest part and it wasn\u2019t because I missed him, I missed the \u201cwhat could have been.\u201d I missed a person who wasn\u2019t real. It was never him and it was never going to be him. I tried to block him out of my life on everything but that would only make him angrier and he\u2019d show up and not leave for days on end. The thought of me moving on made him absolutely insane. How can I be happy if he\u2019s so miserable. No one will ever make him happy because he doesn\u2019t even know who he is. Still to this day he tries to manipulate me. He tries to sweet talk his way back. Promises me the world but I\u2019m done believing it. I found someone who genuinely cares about me. Someone who doesn\u2019t manipulate me and harass me. That scares him more than anything in the world. Everytime he says I love you, he is abusing and manipulating my mind. He is trying to brainwash me again and again. I went through 8 years of this. I pray no other girl ever has to recover from the damage he causes. He will lift your spirits up so high only so he can crush them as hard as he can when he\u2019s ready to. I\u2019m still trying to get my mind and soul right but I\u2019m grateful I figured him out or else I\u2019d still be getting recycled for a long, long time. \n\nGoodluck we will all recover \u2665\ufe0f", "subreddit": "NarcissisticAbuse"}

I had a fireplace video on the TV (don\u2019t have an actual fireplace) and was reading and he finished playing piano and sat down next to me, I was happy to have him near me, but also wondering why he hasn\u2019t acknowledged that I was reading a book as he grabbed the remote and was about to turn on a TV show. He then looks at me and says \u201cdo you want to read out here or...\u201d I just sort of looked up from my book at stared at him, he weirdly asked me if I wanted him to go watch on his phone in the bedroom instead... I didn\u2019t really know what to say because, no, I actually wanted to be next to him, but I was clearly in the middle of reading so I felt a little disrespect from him for interrupting me the way he did. I ended up closing my book and he started putting a show on. I was a bit annoyed honestly and I sighed and stood up, grabbed my book, my phone, and my tea and walked out of the room, it was a bit obvious I was annoyed but I wasn\u2019t storming off of anything. But of course he thought I was and tried to make it like I was mad at him, so he starts turning off all the lights to go to sleep (He\u2019s been sleeping on the couch) I came back out and asked why he\u2019s doing that and that I wasn\u2019t necessarily leaving (I don\u2019t know what I was doing but I ultimately wanted to be near him which is shitty and confusing because he continually treats me like this) and then we argued. All I remember was repeatedly saying to please stop being mean to me and that he sort of made me feel like I had to stop reading, he defended himself saying he asked me if he should go in the room. He just puts me in these positions where I end up looking and feeling like I\u2019m causing all the problems. It\u2019s fucking bullshit because I KNOW I didn\u2019t cause any of this (I\u2019m not perfect and I have played my part in many arguments, but this was just unwarranted). Eventually he was swearing at me and telling me to fuck off etc. I asked him why he is even still here when he has his other place now, his response was to ask me why I\u2019m still here. Wtf. I\u2019m sickened by him. I told him that I am simply standing up for myself and that he needs to stop treating me this way and all I want is for him to be nice. More \u201cfuck off\u201d type responses from him follow. I tell him that he\u2019s broken my heart multiple times yet I still put forth the effort to be fucking kind to him as long as were cohabiting and he treats me like absolute trash, I told him he\u2019s acting like a narcissist and everyone else is wrong except him.

I am hopelessly addicted to the fantasy he gaslights me into believing - that he loves me and would never intentionally do anything to hurt me. I hate what he is purposely doing to me; deep down I really hate him and everything that he stand's for. I live in a world of never ending insanity. He has gotten so far under my skin that he is all I ever think about. Where is he, what is he doing, who is he with, why is he not answering my calls or texts after telling me to get a hold of him and the most unanswered question of all - why is he doing this to me?\n\nHe is a liar, a user, a manipulator, a cheater, a deceiver, a womanizer, an asshole, a loser, a confuser, a lowlife, a no job having bum that trolls girls on the tinder app and uses them by telling them what they want to hear to extract money out of them to survive.\n\nThe sad and pathetic part is I have caught him more times than I can count and my dumb ass has stayed around for this bullshit for over 6 years now.  He has admitted to all of it and is very proud of himself that he has made it 50 years living this way; he claims God has given him a gift, the gift of gab to do or say whatever he needs to to get what he wants by manipulating females. He calls it survival. He thinks because he's not out on these streets illegally selling drugs trying to survive that he is justified in getting money any way he sees fit. And get this, he actually said to me if he has to have sex with them too then so be it, he will do that too because \"it's available\" - he doesn't even want it -  that sex makes him sick but if he has to do it to get what he wants he will. SERIOUSLY!\n\nI tell him that is just sickening to be such a rotten person that karma is going to catch up with him and bring him a female that's going to blow his world to pieces. He doesn't care. He won't change - because it's worked so well for him for so long.\n\nI usually get the chance to snatch up his phone and go thru it when he's passed out in a drunken stooper. I actually make myself physically sick reading what he says to these women. He says things to them that he's never even said to me and when I confront him he tells me he's not using me like he is using them. I feel like I owe each and every one of those women a fair chance to escape his web of deception - I will actually take a picture of him passed out naked in my bed and send it to them proving what I am saying is the truth. I explain to them that he is a piece of shit manipulator and that they better run far and fast away from him or they will end up like me. Most of them at this point have been so love-bombed by him they choose to not believe me.\n\nHe got his claws into some real damaged ones, within a week he is already having sex with them, telling them that he is in love with them and each and every one of them fall for it time and time again.  They start forking out money to him just to get him to spend more time with them. To me he is nothing short of a fucking whore. He is having sex for money, straight up fucking prostitute.  He claims he doesn't even have to ask for money they just offer it to him. WTF!\n\nI can't keep doing this to myself! I have to get away and not look back before I end up in the insane asylum or jail.\n\nHe has pushed all my friends away and I have no one left to talk to about what is going on in my life. The friends I did have are so tired of hearing me say I'm done only to return back to him time and time again. I'm so lost, scared and alone - how did I allow this is happen to me. There is so much more to this story but I don't want to rehash it.\n\nI NEED HELP!\n\nDoes anyone out there have any encouraging words of wisdom that could possibly help me snap out of this funk I am in.

I asked him to stay sober for our tiny little wedding ceremony. He wouldnt even do that.\n\nWe moved in together, and it got worse.\n\nHe realized I wasn't lying when I said I was very sick and struggling.

He kept raping me until I moved into the other bedroom shortly after our first anniversary.\n\nI left March 2014.\n\nHe filed for divorce, and I told him to go ahead and file for a default because I was living on the streets homeless.\n\nHe didn't.

Control over undocumented family members?", "author": "silent_feeling", "self_text": "I'll try not to make this post too long but a very close friend of mine and her family entered the US a couple years ago and overstayed their visa. The father obtained a green card (through his US Marine son, my friend's half brother) and is now a US citizen. Since my friend was an adult by the time her father obtained the citizenship, he wasn't able to petition for her.\n\nThis is where things get sticky. She has told me several events where the father's treatment towards her and her mother is alarming to me. Allegedly, he isn't physically violent in the present, although he strangled her mom once about 15 years ago in another country, she called the cops but didn't press charges; since then he hasn't laid a finger on her. But he has broken dishes and cups out of anger, broken the mother's hair dryer so she's stop doing her hair, ripped a cookbook that she had, etc. Those are few and far between but what goes on on a daily basis is his yelling, saying things like \"in this house, we do what I say,\" \"you have nothing in your head,\" \"you're only useful to clean toilets,\" etc. He will also yell at her in public, embarrassing her and calling her stupid. When she was pregnant with my friend, he would go out drinking with his friends, arrive at 1am and demand that she wake up to make him food, and many similar situations. He has cheated twice (if there has been more, they don't know) and blamed her for it, saying \"one can't live off of beauty,\" implying that the mother had nothing going for her except her looks so he deserved going for other women. He doesn't let her go out when she wants to and she has to ask for permission to buy thing, he has alienated her from her friends (when they lived in the previous country), and has badmouthed her family (and of course can't visit them whenever she wants). He has told her he can get her deported if he wanted.\n\n This is only the treatment of the mom and there's much more. Now, my friend, who is 24 years old, didn't have much problems at first since she was seen as the \"princess\" of the house. She had always been a lonely person with not many friends, never went anywhere so there was never an issue. Until she got a boyfriend three/four years ago. She wasn't allowed to see him because her father didn't approve so she would see him behind his back. She then decided to leave the house but she was physically pushed into her room and onto the bed, called the guy and said he would shoot him if he came near. Eventually the guy broke up with her because it was too much. At that point, she felt like she betrayed her parents and that her ex never loved her.\n\nFast forward to today, she has another boyfriend whom she seems to be serious with. At first, her father let her be out until 9pm, but as time went by, he would demand that she be back home at random hours (2pm, 6pm, etc) to attend to their small business. He has specified that she is not to go to her boyfriend's house, she can't go on trips with him, etc. As time goes on, the situation seems to be worsening. He said if she messes up, not only she but her mom would face the consequences (get them both deported). On 4th of July, she planned on spending it with her boyfriend's family but as she was leaving, she was yanked back by the arm and was told not to go or never come back. Since she was fed up, she agreed, that she would leave and attempted to pack her things in a small backpack as fast as she could. When she was about to leave, he blocked the door, begging her to stay, when she wouldn't listen, he pulled her into the living room and pushed her onto the sofa (all the while my friend was screaming and crying uncontrollably), he yanked her backpack (causing her glasses to almost fly off), when she tried using her apple watch to call help, he grabbed that too and hurt her hand (which she felt for the next two days). There's more to this story, but I think you get the point by now. She's scared to leave bc she or her mom may get hurt, they're forced to work many hours daily on the business or else they'll get deported, their time is controlled by him, he yells and belittles them on a daily basis if they don't agree with him or do things his way. \n\nDo you think this is emotional abuse? What should she do about it?\n\nNote: My friend and has moments where she isn't sure if she's being emotionally abused and feels guilty for finding help or even thinking about leaving the house. She also feels leaving would be the end of her future and career (as her father has said).", "subreddit": "emotionalabuse"}

It was purely emotional manipulation for four years (with lots of cheating I didn't learn about until years later), followed by daily physical abuse for three years. Then another year of separation, manipulation, and infidelity. Then two more years of dishonesty, emotional and physical abuse. My body will never be the same; I've lost a lot of my hearing, and I'm living with injuries to my spine that make it difficult to function, but healthcare is completely inaccessible. I will never be the same; I find it impossible to believe that there's anyone out there who can be trusted. I find it impossible to believe that anybody cares about me, because I have been isolated almost this entire time. I had so many friends that left because they were tired of dealing with the fact that I wouldn't just up and leave-- that at the time, I wasn't even given any information to understand that what was happening was wrong. I had already been severely depressed for years when the relationship began. In the beginning, I was easily convinced that the problems were mine. It would be 7 years of paranoia, gaslighting, and blaming myself before I would find evidence of infidelity that had occurred with many people over several years.\n\nIn the time that we have lived together since our separation, I tried to end the relationship many times. I was physically unable to end the relationship. I cannot flee the relationship because I just can't leave behind everything I've worked for. In 2017 I lost my home and nearly everything I owned in a flood (the same month my partner started cheating on me again). I rebuilt my life, got this apartment, took two years to vaguely furnish and decorate it. I don't care. I built this life after my last one fell apart again, and I refuse to be forced out of my own apartment.\n\nThe abuse is much more rarely physical these days. Some people think I should send her to prison again, but I know one arrest at this point would actually ruin her life forever (her last one was her third strike, also felony DV because I admitted she had strangled me). I know I shouldn't care about that, but the only way I've survived what has been done to me is by trying to be a compassionate person. I don't know how else to cope.\n\nI just really wanted to rant a little bit about what some people in this group already know but I always have to remind myself not everyone understands.

I hope everyone is well and continuing their healing. As far as mine, I\u2019ve been NC for 2 months shy of a year! I\u2019m so proud of myself. I\u2019m a lurker on the sub but still cheering everyone on from behind the screen. \nI recently ended an extended relationship with a very, very kind man although his lack of boundaries, codependency and insecurities were becoming too much for me to deal with. Especially as I\u2019ve learned more and more about myself from continuing my trauma therapy. Who I am now wouldn\u2019t recognize me at the beginning of the year if we met on the street. I\u2019ve been single since September and have spent my time enjoying being alone for the first time in 5 years. I\u2019m finishing my last semester, about to graduate from college and move to a major city to find work. I\u2019m also emotionally unavailable for a relationship and am not looking to date atm. SO ~ here\u2019s the scoop:\n\nMy friend introduced me to her younger brother last month during homecoming, let\u2019s call him J, and we hit it off. I felt crazy on the inside around him.   I wanted him inside me. Literally said he could be my husband/soulmate. We had a lot of fun. Big group of mutual pals and a drunken, hazy, sleepless 3 day weekend of partying and hooked up. I knew that I was super attracted to him but couldn\u2019t understand why. He has a charm about him when he\u2019s in a group but it\u2019s literally... just....narcissism. He\u2019s confident, if I looked like him I\u2019d be confident but Jesus..humility is still cool. Initially, my senses around him weren\u2019t that sharp. The weekend we met he got extremely drunk &amp;amp;amp; coked out of his mind on game day and ended up finding me, screaming in my face, calling me and my friends trashy (cause he couldn\u2019t mooch from them) and making me cry. We spoke the next day and he apologized, chalked it up to just being drunk though and that was that. Over the holiday, he played a cat &amp;amp;amp; mouse game commenting on my IG stories trying to get me to beg him to hang out with him, I literally did not entertain and eventually said \u201cjust ASK if you want to take me on a date dude it can\u2019t be that painful\u201d. So he did. I went to dinner and to a bar with him last weekend, ALONE, and realized what it is about him. He\u2019s:\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2022CHEAP ($15 drinks, complaining yet kept ordering $70 worth and expecting the bartender to not charge him? Who is he??)\n\n\n\n\n\u2022Attention seeking (insisted we go to a bar after he had spent Thanksgiving not really drinking with family and then invited his \u201cfriends\u201d)\n\n\n\n\u2022Nonstop talking (looking back over Friday night, it was a blur and I only had 3 beers. He had me dizzy he talked so much..about himself... I maybe said 16 words)\n\n\n\n\u2022Sexually inappropriate/lusty/whorish (yknow the type, checks out most women in the vicinity with no discretion and talked about nudes on his phone from other girls, bro..)\n\n\n\n\u2022LITERALLY said he plans to \u201cmarry rich\u201d (almost vomited on the bar, no really)\n\n\n\n\u2022Delusional (thinks he\u2019s the \u201cchillest\u201d when it\u2019s so obvious he\u2019s an insecure try hard little boy who needs a hug from his mom, also has \u201cmajor commercial development plans\u201d with \u201cinvestors\u201d that he claimed to have \u201crubbed shoulders with\u201d) \n\n\n\n\n\n\u2022LIAR (I caught him in a few, like telling me his birthday was in February when it\u2019s really in May, but didn\u2019t call him out. Just clocked it. And other small things. Literally wrote in my journal \u201che be lying\u201d)\n\n\n\n\n\u2022Amazing in bed (let\u2019s just not)\n\n\nI see him for what he is. I had to check in with my best friend to see if I was cray. I am not. The feelings I guess, are the bells in my gut saying RUN FOR YOUR LIFE GIRL THIS MAN IS PSYCHO, THIS WONT END WELL. The worst part is, his sister has a huge upcoming birthday trip to Colorado and I\u2019m invited but in light of this epiphany, I don\u2019t want to spend 4 days stuck looking at and listening to him. I\u2019m done hooking up with him, and plan on ignoring his future contacts. HELP", "subreddit": "NarcissisticAbuse"}

I remember the look in his eyes so clearly. I held on to my stuffed gorilla, which was bigger than I was, and cried until I fell asleep there. He would not let me out for more than two days. I had to go to the bathroom on a bath towel - that I remember very vividly. He would not allow my mother to come in to comfort me, nor would he allow me out of my room, so that gorilla was frequently my only source of simulated comfort.  \n\n\nMy dad didn\u2019t take care of me. He didn\u2019t take an interest in me. My mother told me, even as a young child, that my dad never even changed a single diaper of mine. She would have babysitters come watch me while my dad was home, because she couldn\u2019t trust him alone with me and he refused to watch me. I was in ballet, played piano, and played soccer as a child. I had school plays and programs in elementary school. My dad didn\u2019t show up to a single play, soccer game, piano or ballet recital. Not a single one. He wanted to stay home and watch the game. That was something he COULD NOT miss. More important than my childhood, he could not miss a blazer game. My mom made excuses for him or simply didn\u2019t give a response at all. After a while I stopped asking, I just accepted that my mother would be there for me and that\u2019s all that mattered.  \n\n\nIn the third grade, I attempted suicide. I tried hanging myself in my room, but my lamp wasn\u2019t strong enough to hold my weight, so I tried to strangle myself from the top handle of my dresser. It didn\u2019t work and I gave up.  \n\n\nWhen I was in middle school, I started figuring myself out. I started my first relationship in the 8th grade. It was with a girl. Up to that point, I had a computer in my room. It was an old one, while my brother enjoyed the newest apple desktop and an iPad, I had a Microsoft computer from the 90\u2019s because that\u2019s all my parents were willing to spend on me. That computer was tapped, I always knew when my dad was watching me because my mouse would lag a certain way. I got thirty minutes a day of internet time while my brother had no limits.  \n\n\nMy second suicide attempt was in the 8th grade. I took about 30 Advil. I didn\u2019t know what was actually effective and what wasn\u2019t, I didn\u2019t know that all it would do is give me a massive stomach ache. I told my best friend at the time, she was upset. I think she cried. She told me she didn\u2019t know what she would do without me. I don\u2019t think I felt much when she said that. I tried again a week later.  \n\n\nMy dad surveilled everything I did. There were cameras hidden all over the house and he watched my every move online and listened to every phone call. He found a site I visited once, it was like some freaky fan fiction, I was a young teenager, of course I was exploring my sexuality. My dad shamed me in front of my entire family, read some of it out loud, called me disgusting. I tried to say it was a pop up and I exited out of it and he exclaimed, \u201cyou were on this site for exactly 16 minutes. I timed you\u201d. Imagine being 14 or so, trying to figure yourself out sexually, then finding out your father was watching you, and having your entire family laugh at you and shame you.  \n\n\nMy dad found out about my relationship while spying on me as I was having a conversation on AIM with my girlfriend. I must have said something incriminating, called her \u201cbaby\u201d or something, and my dad very quickly put it together. I remember how my heart dropped and my stomach churned when my mouse suddenly started to lag. My internet connection immediately ended and I could hear him stomping up the stairs. He broke down my door. That was the first time he ever beat me. From then on, I didn\u2019t have a computer or a phone. I wasn\u2019t allowed to use the home phone, either. I would sneak on my brothers computer to talk to her, or call her on the home phone when my parents weren\u2019t home. They caught on to that, though, and eventually stopped allowing me to be home by myself.  \n\n\nThe only way I could see her is when I skipped school to take the train out and see her, or she would do the same for me and we would hide in the forest near my house and talk. I got caught on multiple occasions sneaking out, each time my dad carried out my punishment. I was hit and thrown so frequently it misaligned my spine and one shoulder sat higher than the other, noticeably. I finally got that fixed in my early 20\u2019s. I think because my girlfriend was the only one in my life that made me feel loved, I became extremely attached. Which is why, in my freshman year of high school, when she cheated on me and broke up with me, it sent me into the worst depression I had felt up to that point. I spent my whole childhood in isolation and without affection, and then someone came along and showed me what I was robbed of for the first time, and that person abandoned me too. I developed an eating disorder - I was so depressed I couldn\u2019t eat. I lost a lot of weight. My mom noticed and she put me in a treatment center. I got kicked out not too long after for not participating. Over the course of the next couple years I would be hospitalized about three times for weeks at a time for heart conditions caused by malnutrition. I couldn\u2019t eat. I wanted to die.  \n\n\nMy third suicide attempt happened around this time. I took 3 blister packs of NyQuil - about 24 pills total. I didn\u2019t wake up for like two days and when I did, I was not coherent - I told my mom what I did and she immediately committed me to a psychiatric ward. I don\u2019t remember much of what happened there but I do remember how mean the staff there was. When I got out, I was watched even MORE closely. My mom would come to my school during lunch and make me spend my lunch in the car with her, because she didn\u2019t want me socializing. She wanted to watch me eat my lunch and then make sure I went straight back to class. How did she not realize this was only making me want to die even more?  \n\n\nMy dad went into my room while I was at school and searched my things. He found a journal of mine with a suicide letter written in it. When I got home I saw the notebook on my bed, and my dad came in and beat me again. That\u2019s when my door, already broken and unable to close from him breaking it down, was taken off it\u2019s hinges completely and permanently. He told me that he wanted me to be permanently institutionalized because he didn\u2019t want to deal with me anymore, and he would do anything he could to make sure I was locked up for the rest of my life.  \n\n\nI was sent to the same treatment center for a second time. I still didn\u2019t participate. I was kicked out for a second time. I went back to high school, and decided to run away one day. I didn\u2019t want to be locked up for the rest of my life. I didn\u2019t even prepare. I saw an opportunity to leave campus and get on a bus, and I did it. I turned off my phone and destroyed the battery so I couldn\u2019t be tracked (obviously my phone had a gps tracker my parents required me to carry so they could watch me even further). I can\u2019t remember where I went, I think to clackamas for the night, and I was in northwest Portland at Washington park for part of it. I remember becaus I called my mom from someone else\u2019s phone to tell her I was safe. I hadn\u2019t eaten in days and I was just drinking and taking drugs. I hardly remember it and I don\u2019t remember how I was found.  \n\n\nWhen I finally returned home, I was immediately put on a plane to Arizona. I didn\u2019t even have time to process what was happening to me. My dad didn\u2019t say goodbye. I was sent to a ranch in the middle of nowhere called Rosewood center for eating disorders. That place was a fucking joke. The \u201ccounselors\u201d had no college education, and there was one clinical psychologist that came once every two weeks to talk to you for thirty minutes. The counselors were verbally abusive and nasty. The only way you got out was by faking being \u201ccured\u201d, because otherwise you would stay forever and that was terrifying. I was 17 when I got out. I stayed healthy until I turned 18 because that\u2019s when they couldn\u2019t send me back. I remember when I finally got discharged from that program my mom made me call my dad and tell him, and my dad cried on the phone because he didn\u2019t want me back. That\u2019s the only time I have ever heard my dad cry.  \n\n\nA day after I turned 18, I moved to Miami to be with a girl I had met and was in a long distance relationship with. My time there was hell. She ended up being abusive, big surprise. She is to this day the most selfish, childish, deceitful, dishonest person I have ever met. I stayed with her for five years and two more suicide attempts. I was heavily manipulated and threatened if I tried to leave. She tried to kill me once, but she had such a small frame that I was able to get her away from me. Another time she pushed me out of a car on the freeway at night because I spilled coffee in her car. Again I was isolated, controlled, and constantly surveilled and grounded when I was \u201cmisbehaving\u201d. She took my independence from me so she could trap me. She wouldn\u2019t allow me to have a job, or get a car in my own name. She took almost all my belongings when I finally got the courage to leave her, including stealing my car. I didn\u2019t care - I wanted to be free. Up until then I had never experienced freedom in my life or had anything that belonged to me.  \n\n\nI moved to New Mexico and tried to start a new life with someone new. I still struggle with feeling like I have anything in my life that is mine. I have a car which is nice. The house I pay for and live in doesn\u2019t belong to me. I\u2019ve been reminded on more than one occasion that I\u2019m a guest here. It makes me so sad. It\u2019s only when he drinks. But Jesus Christ, he is mean when he does. I\u2019ve given him a lot of chances to change, he only turns into a monster when he\u2019s had too much to drink, that\u2019s when I turn into a target. I try to help him and I told him to seek therapy because I didn\u2019t know how to properly help him. He didn\u2019t really listen he just said he didn\u2019t have the money and he\u2019s not ready. I wonder if I am again being tricked into a cycle of abuse I can\u2019t break away from. This one doesn\u2019t feel the same, we don\u2019t fight when he\u2019s sober and the fights that happen when he is drunk occur only once every three months or so. But they are really bad. He feels bad afterwards and I am convinced that he will never do it again every single time. It feels like he loves and respects me most of the time, until he doesn\u2019t. He doesn\u2019t know if he wants to get married or have kids. I\u2019m not embarrassed to admit that I do want those things. Maybe I just don\u2019t deserve them. Maybe this is what I get and I should just be happy with it because at least I\u2019m not being beaten up, cheated on, or thrown out on the side of the freeway anymore.", "subreddit": "abuse"}

I didn't want him to take on that pretty intern--she seemed *off* to me, shades of disrespect thrown subtly my way. When he told me she'd be his apprentice, I paused. I took a breath. I told him I was uncomfortable with it--yes, it was irrational, yes it was petty jealousy. But I'd never had any problem with any of his former female friends, not once. Not when he ditched me on my birthday to go watch one perform in a band, not when he met up with a former friends-with-benefits, never.\n\nI understood all that, but I wanted to have a simple discussion to see if he would be willing to perhaps have her apprentice under one of his co-workers, so he wouldn't be spending every working hour on top of her. He also had a whopping EIGHT MONTHS to find her a different mentor.\n\n\"You don't trust me,\" he accused me. \"You're being crazy. You're being irrational.\"\n\nIt wasn't a conversation.

Hmm, he hadn't noticed her attitude--would we all three like to go out and have dinner, and then see if I still have those concerns? \n\nThat \\^ simple conversation would have been all it would have taken to lay to rest my insecurities. That's it.\n\nInstead, we fought for months and months and months. I worked hard to lose weight, to be the best wife possible, to ignore their constant texting, to ignore the red flags he was waving around. To ignore how hurtful it was as he compared me to her, all the time.\n\nSo, she interned for him. He became obsessed with her. They texted all the time, about everything. He visited her after work at one of her hobbies, even though the thought of him watching her dance filled me with agony. And then he started lying--he was meeting friends he never had hung out with before, he told me. He decided to go out to dinner by himself and GASP she just happened to be there! And then, when I was away on a trip, he took her out to dinner, drinks, all the works. Who knows how long it would've lasted or if that is all that occurred--but I caught him. I caught him and he lied. through. his. teeth. until I presented the damning evidence.\n\nI shouldn't have shown him the evidence. I should have left that night.\n\nI blamed myself. I had been months of agony, of trying not to let it destroy my self-esteem any further, of sobbing outbursts from me--I was the crazy one, I was the jealous one--but now I understand that it wasn't the case.

And when I start to talk about myself he literally goes almost silent, maybe will just go..uh huh, oh, but he doesn\u2019t ask a lot of questions. \n\n2. He is pushing hard to meet up, and he lives about 90 miles away. I have been pretty nonchalant about it, because I have done the LDR before and space doesn\u2019t bother me. I have told him that I have some anxiety issues from a past relationship and need to take things slow.\n\n3. He mentioned that he hasn\u2019t really had a long relationship. His longest relationship was maybe 2 years he said and that was 15 years ago. Also mentioned that his last relationship was 5 months long and she was \u201ccrazy\u201d.  Said she was \u201clying\u201d to people and saying he was stalking her and wouldn\u2019t quit texting/calling, etc. \n\n4. I was talking about a movie I watched called \u201cUs\u201d by Jordan peele. He kind of went out of his way to say something that gave me pause.  It was something to the effect of \u201cboth Key and Peele are half white/half black\u201d, and I said, \u201coh really, hmm\u201d.  Then he goes on to say \u201cyeah, but you notice how they really play up the black side, I mean they are white too, what\u2019s wrong with being white\u201d.....something about that gave me a twinge. It was a little too trumpish for me, there just seems to be an entitlement in him. \n\n5. He talks about himself and his interests constantly. And he is one of those \u201cI only watch sports and ESPN\u201d guys, and that is literally all he says he watches.  Maybe this is just more of something that is not compatible with me. \n\n6. I think he is testing the \u201ctriangulation\u201d waters. One night mentioned he was at a bands thing and there were young girls there.  Then mentioned a couple days later that he had some girl trainee with him all day, etc. idk if he was testing to see what my boundaries are, or if I\u2019m just seeing ghosts. \n\nThere are a few other things, but those were the main ones. I just think I need to find a nice way to say thanks but no thanks.  And last question, would that be crappy to do over text? I haven\u2019t met him in person yet and we have only been talking like a week. \n\nI just don\u2019t want to make a mistake and get into a relationship with another Narc.", "subreddit": "NarcissisticAbuse"}

Also: the good ol' \"english isn't my first language\" disclaimer\n\nWell, title says it all. Last weekend was my 2 years break up/NC anniversary with my not-at-all-missed NEX. Last year, my friends and I decided to make a thing out of it and get absolutely hammered yearly, and i couldn't feel better about it!\n\nI guess it helps me remind why I'm celebrating. Went stone cold NC after the break up, not knowing how hard it would be not to break it. 1 week in, she went and talked with all my close friends to share \"her side of the story\", saying I'm a good boy, but I need help and as soon as I get it i'd realize the mistake I'm making and so on. 2 weeks and she reaches for my family, sets up coffee with my aunt so she can talk about my problems and texts my mom to say I should come back to her. Cuz, you know, fights happen and i should really take care of my problem. \n\nWhat problem? Oh, right. The anger management issue. You know, the one I didn't have untill I met her. Actually, the one I didn't have untill I started doing things that she didn't like. Like not being comfortable when she grinded with other dudes in front of me at parties (\"what? That didn't happen, you're going Crazy\") or not admitting to something I didn't do (\"I KNOW you cheated on me, just TELL ME!!!\")\nWhenever I spoke up, I was the crazy, out of control one. And I almost bought it. I mean, I did. After a particularly nasty fight, and smashing my phone in it, I went to therapy. She sat me down and said she believed me, that I wasn't who my NEX said i was. \n\nGod, I got lucky. She picked so many fights with random people that i'm baffled I never got my ass kicked. Tried so many times to push me to the edge and make me beat her. Tried to put our life in danger having jealous episodes behind the wheel and almost crashing. \n\nBut there's a happy ending to this story. I survived. I fucking lived - and better yet, I saw what went wrong and learned from it. I found an awesome gf who knows and loves me for who I am, nightmares and all lol, and I have friends who supported me through all that shit, and they were all there drinking cheap beer with me saying how glad they were I was there. I have you guys, that helped me realize narcs are all the same boring shit no matter where. I'm me, the real me, not the psycho that i once thought i was. And that's priceless!\n\nSo: don't break NC. Trust yourselves. Get help. Stay strong. And finally... Let's drink to that!", "subreddit": "NarcissisticAbuse"}

I think its too long to go into incredible detail, but right now I just feel that gross disgusted in myself feeling. I was avidly on the internet ever since I was in middle school and was often in chat rooms, on different social websites, and got really involved in several online communities. One of these that i got closest to was the straight edge / hardcore community. It meant everything to me to know that there were people out there with the same values and interests as me. Being 15 and wanting to be a part of this group, I found myself talking to all sorts of people of different ages, genders, etc. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOne of the first people that was particularly popular ( had a straight edge clothing line / was in bands) ended up reaching out to me over instagram after I had bought one of his lines shirts. At first, it was pretty innocent chatting. It was just a nice dude talking to me about music, video games, and spending lots of time complimenting me on how cool I was for being so young and having so many similar interests to him. He lived far away so all we did was talk over KIK or Skype, thankfully I never had an in person encounter with this man, but our relationship lasted 3.5 years. He reeled me in quick, telling me how special I was and the connection we had. I think its called \"love bombing,\" where the whole 'getting to know you' stage is skipped and you basically end up married to somebody in a short time period. We talked every day, all day. Every night we would exchange nudes / sexts. I became closed off to some friends and most of my family so that I made sure we had enough of \"our time\" every day. All the while I decided to ignore the fact that I was only 15 falling down this rabbit hole of an online relationship with a man twice my age. For some reason my adolescent brain thought \"he loves me, its special because we have things we only share with each other; hes going to be my first and only lover; he asks me for these pictures and videos because he wants every part of me.\" \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI feel grossed out by that. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLots of these memories feel hazy so I am doing my best to remember where it started to get abusive, but its easy to see the red flags right? It got to a point where I needed to share my location with him at all times (he needed to know I was where I said I would be), I had to constantly update him of what i was doing, who with, what times, etc. Every night I had to send him new nude pictures, we needed to talk on the phone when I got home from school and I needed to stay up all night with him and keep him company. (he online had the online business so he basically just was home all the time). On the other hand, these tasks were hard to keep up with everyday. I had just gotten my first job, was on the varsity golf team, and was in multiple honors classes at school. Most days I woke up at 6:30am for school, went to work or practice then talked to him until about 1-2am. God forbid I fall asleep texting him or took too long to respond. It got to a point where I was so scared to mess up because of how he would lash out at me. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf I forgot to text him good morning / goodnight, it was \"You don't love me! You're all I have and I make you a priority, you can't even give me a text in your day?!?!?\" or constantly questioning my faithfulness, my love, the relationship if I didn't have time to give him a phone call one day. It was so hard to keep him happy and also keep this a secret from my family. He always gave me tips on how to lie about who I was talking to all the time to make sure they didn't know it was him. (at one point they found out, but that's a whole other story I don't want to type out rn). I think I feel particularly fucked up about how much I stressed out over trying to not make him upset. He would make me feel bad if I wanted to see friends or go do things with my sisters, and if I did participate in anything I always had to send him photos or some form of proof, i am not sure why, but he never trusted me. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis lasted from my Sophomore year of high school to my freshman year of college. Lots of stuff happened in that time, but overall I spent most of high school scared to make friends, scared to post online (without permission or approval), scared about my choices and if he will approve or find a a reason to think i hate him for things I wanted to do. I think back to all the gas-lighting, all the threats, and how much he tried to convince me he was only acting erratic because he was so in love with me. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhy was a man in his 30's so content with doing this to a 15 year old girl? All those things he made me do, lies I told, I even hurt some people because that was easier to do than try and calm down his tantrums. Once I got fed up to the point of being brave enough to break up with him, he didn't even believe that I was just trying to leave him. He texted me about 100 times saying \"Your cheating aren't you???\" Well I wasn't, but guess what? I wanted him to leave me alone so badly I just said yeah I am cheating so he would go off on me and then at that point leave me alone after name calling me and trying to gaslight me. Side note: To this day I worry about what he has done with my nudes.... \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis man made me hate myself, question my decisions, hate my body, lie to my family and friends, and miss out on so much in high school. I fucking hate it. He controlled almost every move I made for years, I feel like I was and am pretty smart, why do I look back on this and just feel so disgusted and upset with myself? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNot sure where I was goin with this or what I want out of posting, I guess I have never told anybody this before.

Very often, you will be living in the same city or region, may be you are working for the same company etc.\n\nNC is truly a mindset. A mindset to dominate. A mindset to naturally show the narc that they really don't matter and that you came out of the relationship much stronger than before.\n\nTheir game is to manipulate you and take over your life. Don't care about them and their game. Focus on yourself and your own game.\n\nBad things have to be replaced with good ones, otherwise chances are high to fall into the dark hole again.\n\nIf you are doing NC right, it does not matter if you see pictures of that person, if you bump into that person while doing groceries or anywhere else, because they simple don't matter.\n\nNo one can bring back the past, but we can learn from it and grow from pain.

Cold, unfeeling, passive aggressive and petty.\n\nI tried to bring this to her attention and I don't know if she is really oblivious or doing it on purpose.

Yes, I've made my mistakes, but I'm not the only one at fault.\n\nIf anything, I 1) have to remind myself on the daily that I am *not* crazy and what I went through and my opinions are fucking valid, and 2) that not all friends have the EQ to understand and empathize and that's okay and to only go to those who are safe.", "subreddit": "NarcissisticAbuse"}

Much of it was very well disguised as concern, as \"just low self-control\", as \"I am just so into you and care about you so much\" etc.\n\nProbably, many of you share that struggle: \"He was mean but then he was often nice to me too\", \"He actually did some things for me, how can it be abuse then\", \"He was usually not super-outright evil\" etc. That's also the cognitive dissonance at work, the however small part of oneself that still believes their fake portrayal that they care(d) about you like a normal human being does.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWith  some articles/videos and lots of endless rumination, I feel I just reached some insight about an aspect of emotional abuse that I overlooked before:\n\n*Abusers explicitly and/or implicitly tell you that you are selfish. Repeatedly and basically all the time.*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAny time you do something for yourself, i.e. not for them, you are \"selfish\". You \"only think about yourself\" etc. Even if they don't say it outright, you can feel this accusation, in their demeanor, in their emotional aura, in how they punish you for it later. The never-ending frequency and how they say it tells you that they see you as a selfish *person* \\- it's not just some *actions* of yours.\n\nAnd we in this subreddit are the ones who unfortunately started to believe them at some point. That's how we forgot how to care for ourselves: Abusive people have convinced us that we are bad people when we do things for ourselves, when we don't do things for them. It's such a simple concept, but I'm amazed how much I'm struggling with it and how near impossible it seems to overcome this inner barrier. Yeah, it's been trained into me all my life. I am optimistic though, as now is the first time ever that I really recognized the abuse as such.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm curious what's your experience with people in your life:\n\n* How many people have really told you that you are selfish, as a person?\n* You yourself, have you told people that they are a selfish person? How many?\n\nIn my case, if I remember correctly, the only people who did that to me were the 2-3 abusers who I had close to me in my life. Other people certainly told me when i did something stupid/bad/shitty. Some might even have said that I did something selfish. I got the message and hopefully grew by it, and i never felt personally attacked as I felt with the abusers - they really attack you as a person.\n\nI think I never told anyone they are selfish as a person. Not even the nex, not even when he discarded me to instantly get together with a sudden new dude and expected me to stay in the friendzone as basically a backup plan and be a happy cheerleader for him (after he told me I was his everything and made me believe we would marry for life, during our \"relationship\"). The most I could get out of my mouth was \"That's a pretty selfish thing for you to expect of me.\" (When he really was one of the 2-3 people in my life that would have deserved to get an explicit rock bottom character judgement.)\n\nAnd I do think the main problem with that nex or really with any abuser is not that he was selfish. Being selfish is not abusive in itself. The abusive part was that he enjoyed to see my emotional pain and my submission to his wants against my own, and that he vomited/projected all his negative inner stuff onto me, just so that his disordered toddler self wouldn't need to feel any of it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI believe the following to hold truth:\n\nAs a healthy adult, you don't tell someone else that they are a selfish person. You recognize that it's actually entirely normal to be selfish, i.e. to do things for oneself. You might tell to someone that they did something stupid/bad/shitty, but you won't attack someone else's character for doing things for themselves. If you dislike a person's actions, you don't even have to say anything, you can just remove yourself from that person.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThat's also why I think *if someone tells you that you're a selfish person, that's a huge red flag*. Only people who think you are not allowed to do things for yourself will tell you such a thing. That is, abusers.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, I hope I'm not entirely off here. The following as a TLDR takeaway:\n\n* Being selfish is completely normal. Healthy people recognize that and will decide for themselves if they want you and your wants in their life  or not.\n* Pretty much only abusers tell you things like \"you are so selfish\" to make you disregard your own wants and serve theirs. And they do it regularly. That makes it a red flag.\n* Abused people might actually need to relearn how to be selfish, and how to be that in accordance with other people's wants.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nGlad to get any type of feedback!", "subreddit": "NarcissisticAbuse"}

He told me about her because she had been texting him, frantically. He told me she was crazy, that she was obsessed with him even months after they broke up and wanted to marry him. He even showed me the texts to show me how \"crazy\" she was, where she was begging him to come back, saying that she realized now that they were meant to be together.\n\nAt the time, I took it at face value. Okay, he has an ex who isn't over him. Sucks for her. But he texted her (and made a point of showing me), \"Too late, I'm with someone else now and I'm finally very happy, you missed your chance.\"\n\nLooking back with what I know now about the cycle and the harem of supply they keep on the backburner, it's clear as day to me what was happening with her. He probably recently discarded her or they were \"taking a break\" like we so often did, almost bi-monthly. Though when we would \"break up\" it would only take me a few days or less to start begging him to come back.\n\nI would not be surprised at all if, after he showed me the text he sent clearly shutting her down, he texted her more malicious things, guilt-tripping, instilling jealousy and insecurity, comparing me, the idealized brand new supply, to her -- the disheveled, emotional mess, as a result of his torture, of course. Perhaps he continued to leave bread crumbs for her, keeping her at an arms length. Or perhaps she was the girl he was staying with, after I helped him buy an apartment but never got to come over and see it. (My theory is that he pocketed the money I gave him and moved in with one of his other victims.)\n\nI think he did this for many reasons. As an attempt to prove to me that he was trustworthy and loyal (he showed me these texts, then we both went through each other\u2019s phones once to \u201cestablish trust\u201d, and then he never let me go on his phone again). To set up for a potential comparison between his ex and I (almost as a warning of \u201cyou better not be like this crazy chick\u201d). As an attempt to instill jealousy in me, and perhaps even to make me feel that he was valuable and wanted by other girls.\n\nI wonder who he showed my texts to, to show them how erratic and crazy his ex was when I was that emotional mess panicked by the thought of losing him.

I wasn't personally punished very often, I was the \"good kid\", but my brother was. It seemed like for any little thing that he did wrong he got spanked. I remember listening in on his spankings from my bedroom and wondering what it was like to be hit. I used to burn my feet on the radiator to test out how much I could withstand pain, if I could take it like my brother did. A couple more vivid memories are of my dad spanking him for things like talking (arguing?) with me too much in the car, pushing and hitting other kids, and small things like throwing a soda can to him and having it fizz all over, for accidentally spilling powdered sugar downstairs and making more of a mess by trying to clean it up, for drawing in marker on his carpet when he was 5, things that are accidents and normal for a kid. In a lot of these instances, I was involved as well and somehow glossed over. I rarely received punishments, only a couple of times for things like sticking out my tongue or talking back (whatever that means), but I remember feeling small and afraid. I think my dad hugged me after and it wasn't usually too bad or painful, I guess they disciplined me \"the right way\", but there was always this fear because I saw that my brother was punished for every little thing. And I don't think that it was often done with the kind \"discipline\" that everyone talks about, it often felt very scary and very uncalled for and extreme for the offense.\n\nMy dad stopped spanking us when we were 10 or 11. I guess that's pretty normal. From then on, we fought mostly with shouting matches and occasionally being physically attacked. My brother had a ton of behavioral issues, always fighting with other kids, misbehaving and getting into mischief. He was labelled as the bad kid in school, and each time he did something my parents would respond drastically. After we turned 11ish they started grounding us, taking away privileges, things like this. That seemed pretty normal. Although I always had the feeling that we were punished more frequently and for lesser things than anybody else I talked to. My brother was almost constantly grounded, so much so that he didn't have friends or a social life, but instead was kept isolated. They often would lock him in his room for a week or more and feed him only bread and water. This happened to me a couple times, but not longer than a night or two. He was always locked up and there was always fighting between them.\n\nMy mom was the shouter more often than anything. She could be set off by any small thing which would begin a tyrad of how ungrateful we are of her, how she gave up everything for us and we can't even respect her, that we are disrespectful and bad kids and on and on and on. She would work herself into an absolute rage and just keep going and going, and if you ever tried to say anything for yourself or showed some short of reaction she would sometimes get physically violent or come up and shout right in our faces, belittling us. One time she was flipping out and I made the mistake of laughing a little because I was about 13 and it was just too funny how angry she was getting. She ended up throwing something at me, I think it was a cucumber, which didn't hurt at all but definitely scared me. From then on I remembered that whenever she was going off I had to remain stonefaced and hide absolutely all my emotions. I would respond only with what I thought would end things. I never stood up for myself, because if I did things got worse. I had to always say \"You're right, I'm sorry for.... \" and then take whatever punishment. This happened all the time, I always felt on edge in my house like something was about to go off at any moment.\u00a0\n\nMy dad was more of the silent, stoic disciplinarian. You always wanted to tell him what went wrong because he could handle things better. It was the same thing, always saying \"I'm sorry, you're right Dad (we always had to call them by Dad or Mom or else it was disrespectful)\" and stonefacing while they told you what you did wrong and what would happen now that you had. The problem with him was that every so often he would absolutely snap, and then god help you if you're in proximity. The first time it happened I was maybe around 13 and we were fighting about something or other and he just snapped and slapped me hard across the face. Then he paused and did it again. And then he did it again. It was very deliberate and hard and it was entirely done out of anger. He apologized later, but I never forgot it. I was always a little scared of him. He'd get this look in his eyes and his face would go red and he'd clench his teeth and then you'd know you'd done it. He would either start shouting or hit you, often both. I saw this time and time again with my brother as we were growing up. I can count each time my parents hit me, but I can't count how many times they hit him. I found little ways of resisting them that were safe but made me feel like I still had a little freedom. They called me sassy and insolent, which I definitely was sometimes. I would just stoneface all the time, keep all my emotions at how unfair or excessive something was down, go along with it until I would explode one day and just get into these huge fights. To this day these fights are why they think \"I deserved it\" because I would sometimes provoke them. That is unfair because I took so much. It's impossible to keep all those emotions suppressed.\u00a0\n\nI read a lot of books about abused children. I would specifically seek them out in the library. Maybe I was looking for consolation. Part of me realized that something was very wrong with my family. The only problem was that a lot of those books had examples that were very drastic, like breaking bones and strangling/drowning people. This made me think that my situation can't have been abuse because I didn't fear, like, dying or anything. Then there were books where very similar things to what happened in my house went on. I often would reject these as abuse narratives, possibly because I couldn't accept what was happening to me. Over time I began believing that I had made up this narrative of abuse because I was \"dramatic\" or \"negative\" and that they had done everything out of love.\u00a0\n\nThe punishments started getting more and more drastic and bizarre because \"we hadn't learned\". For me this usually meant being locked in my room for long periods of time, sometimes denied food. They would make me take out all my electronics, books, anything so that I felt very truly \"punished\". I think at some point they took my door entirely off so that I had no privacy whatsoever. We had to ask to go the bathroom or else... (I don't really remember what happened, longer time in your room? getting hit?) If we were caught out of our rooms there was hell to pay.\u00a0\n\nAround the age of 15 my mother refused to continue buying me clothes because I was \"too hard to deal with\". If we said something to her that she didn't like while in the car she would pull over on the side of the road and make us walk home, wherever we were. The first few times I assumed that she would eventually come back for me, but she didn't. One time she did this I ended up staying in the woods well past nightfall. When I got home I was berated for how long I took because she was so worried, which always struck me as interesting. She often seemed more worried about people finding out what happened to us then she was with us. A couple times when I got older friends of mine drove by me walking around town and would offer rides. I never accepted because I was scared that it would anger her more because I wasn't \"punished\". One time I accepted the ride but halfway there saw my mom driving the car towards us. I flipped out and hide in the back of the car while my friend drove, and then when she passed immediately got out because I was so scared of her finding out.\u00a0\n\nAround this time, things between my brother and my parents got worse and worse.\u00a0Again, I wasn't nearly the recipient of so much punishment as my brother, and even now I will never know everything that happened between them. He started acting out more, got into drugs and alcohol, started stealing things from them for money since they never gave him any. There were so many shouting matches. Since I had two younger (like, babies) siblings I would often take care of them and keep them occupied while they fought downstairs. A couple of memories really stick out. One time they were fighting in the living room while I had the two kids in bed with me upstairs. My mom I think started getting violent, pushing or hitting my brother, and he pushed her back to defend himself. My dad punched him in the face. I think he had a pretty huge bruise. My dad also would occassionally hit my mom I think. I remember one time they were having a shouting match downstairs and she went for him with some sort of utensil (a spoon? a knife?) and he hit her really hard \"in self defense\". She left the two kids with me (because my dad couldn't take care of them) and stayed for three days in a hotel somewhere. We thought she was gone forever.\u00a0\n\nAt some point my mom threw a glass of wine at my brother which shattered on the ceiling (the stain is still there) and the glass broke all over him. They would lock him outside overnight on the porch no matter what the weather was. This was my mother's way of punishing us usually, telling us that she was taking away our \"privileges\" like a house and food. I told my dad that she was crazy and he yelled at me that if I said anything else I would join him. At this point I got my drivers license and a car so I stayed out as much as possible. The air was toxic in that house. There was tension everywhere.\u00a0\n\nIn my senior year of high school my parents locked my brother outside for over a week. He would sneak in to shower and take food when they weren't home. He lived in the woods out back of our house in a teepee made of sticks and leaves (he was a Boy Scout). I worked in a bagel shop and so would bring him food after work (if my parents weren't home, we weren't allowed to talk to him) or sometimes a hot pizza. He wasn't allowed back inside until he had apologized for whatever it was he had done. To this day they still think this was okay because the only reason he stayed outside so long was that he was not humble enough to apologize.\u00a0\n\nAt this point I was terrified of my parents. Even though they rarely actively hurt me, from what I saw with my brother they could flip at anytime and were capable of really hurting us. I started staying over at friends houses as often and as long as possible. I rarely went home. When I did, something usually happened, some fight or argument. It was impossible.\u00a0\n\nCPS was called on us when I was in senior year of high school. At this point a lot of my friends and their parents suspected something was wrong. Whenever I let slip something that happened to them I got the feeling that something about it was wrong. At some point parents started approaching my parents and us about things which just made them more angry. They would claim that nobody could understand how far we pushed them and just how bad we were. If they had to deal with us, they claimed, they would be pushed to do the same. My brother was in therapy at this point. He mentioned at some point that my mom hit him and the therapist called CPS. I came home that day to my mother packing her bags and the bags of the two kids and wailing that my brother had once again ruined their lives by getting CPS involved and that she and the children were likely to be deported (she's a citizen of another country). I loved my baby siblings so much and I remember getting so angry and yelling at my brother for taking them away, that our parents didn't really do anything that bad. That was the thing, they always made it out to be his fault for everything, for their behaviors. The therapist (because they were friends with my parents) ended up retracting a statement and CPS never showed up. I still wonder what would have happened if they had.\u00a0\n\nI remember one time I saw a commercial for CPS on TV and my mother explained to me that some children call CPS for bad reasons, like they didn't want to take a spanking after they did something wrong or were mad that their parents punished them. I had to understand that sometimes the punishment was for me, even if it hurt. I had to understand they loved me and was doing what was best for me, so there was no need to call CPS.\u00a0\n\nI was glad to leave for college, but things between my brother and my parents just kept getting worse and worse. I had started keeping secrets for my brother from my parents, like who he was dating or whatever, because I knew they would just get mad and hurt him if they knew. He was basically not allowed to have any relationships because he was \"punished\". One time while I was in college they found out I knew he had a girlfriend and my mom didn't speak to me for months. When I went home for the holidays things were just awful. My parents would snap at the smallest things. A couple memories... One time my dad threw me down the stairs, tackled me, and hit my head against the wall over and over until I almost blacked out. Then he kicked me out of the house. I had a friend pick me up. I stayed with them for a few days until my parents called to tell me that if I apologized for whatever it was I did I could come back. They called me insolent for not apologizing earlier. Once I had a panic attack and my dad asked me to empty the dishwasher. I asked him to give me a minute so I could calm down and he got all up in my face and yelled that I was lazy and whatever. I started crying and told him to fuck off. He ended up choking me against a wall. I don't think he apologized for either of these things. He made me apologize instead. I also was kicked out of the house that time and pulled over on the side of the road crying. A police man stopped and asked if I was okay and if someone had hurt me. I couldn't tell him anything. I was too scared. After that I stopped going home for the holidays and made sure that I always had a job so that I never had to rely on them for anything.\n\nThere are other stories. After I left the house for college I'm sure that my brother experienced more violence than when I was there. He started drinking and smoking weed constantly which caused even more problems. He was kicked out of the house permanently twice, then allowed back after a couple months only to be kicked out again. They claim they let him back because they didn't want to set bad examples for my really young siblings. I stopped going back unless I was with my boyfriend, I moved across the country so I only saw them once a year. The distance has made it hard to remember certain things accurately and I still think to this day that everything that happened to us was somehow my fault. Sometimes it feels like I will never heal. I can see how deep these scars run and how the years of pain still have very real effects in my life now.\u00a0A lot of the time I convince myself that none of this is abuse, that they did the best they could. Most of the time I'm just confused and angry.\n\nMy youngest siblings are now approaching their teen years, and I worry what will happen to them. I want to believe that my parents have changed but I know deep down that they probably haven't, and that the same things will start repeating themselves. I wonder if I will have enough courage to call the cops if they lay a hand on either of them.", "subreddit": "survivorsofabuse"}

I mean, I was thrown through walls, tossed around the room, punched, held down, suffocated with body weight, and my mother held knives to my throat and tried to light me on fire. My dad stopped hitting us when I was 12 because I threatened his life. And my mom got worse. And my dad still broke everything. And then my mom was no longer stronger than us, but she still stalks, harasses, blows up everyone\u2019s phones. \n\nI feel desensitized, like it\u2019s just normal and whatever you live and you get through it.

So sweet that I had one for you, \"Babe\". I wasn't a perfect spouse but I loved you Babe. I was always there for you Babe, loyal and honest. I did anything and everything to make you happy Babe. Why? Because you worked so hard to take care of us Babe. You took care of us alright...\n\nYou lied to me Babe. Isolated me, controlled me, humiliated and degraded me to everyone you knew from the very beginning of our relationship. Of course I didn't know that because I trusted you Babe. When I got sick and needed your support Babe, you decided to take revenge against me for that and cheated on me for the remainder of our relationship. When the cheating started you became emotionally, verbally, and financially abusive to my son and myself Babe.\n\nYou increased your cruelty as much as you possibly could have stopping just short of committing a crime Babe. You took off without any notice and ran out of state expecting me to pick up the pieces of the mess you left behind Babe. You continued to mentally, verbally, and financially abuse me from 1,347 miles away Babe. You even decided I was not allowed to talk to anyone else while you started seeing someone new Babe.\n\nYou will never have any remorse for what you've done or genuine feelings for anyone other than yourself for as long as you live Babe. I feel sorry for the future spouses that blindly walk in to the horrible situation that I once did Babe. YOU were the MONSTER all along Babe.\n\nI used to think I drove you to this behavior by getting frustrated, lashing out, and wanting to be away from you. But I realize now I was defending myself fighting off your possessive and controlling nature. You played the part of an innocent doormat taking advantage of my ability to hold myself accountable for my actions and capitalized on it by shaming me in to guilt. The more guilt I felt, the more control you gained and the more egg shells I walked on.\n\nYou were never a victim of me. You always had the ability to leave the relationship and chose not to. Not because you didn't want to give up on me but rather you didn't want to give up total control over someone you knew would never abandon you. You truly are a lonely soul. You slowly created an environment that trapped me as your prisoner. Every insecurity you felt was taken out on me in one way or another making you feel powerful and in control.\n\nYou lift yourself up by putting others down. You have portrayed yourself as a victim of every relationship and friendship you have ever had and always will. For that, you will always be lonely. You're not capable of giving unconditional genuine love to anyone. I pitty you because you will never experience true love or true friendship. Everyone in your life merely serves an egotistical purpose to you.\n\nI'd like to give you words of wisdom or advice on how to get help and change, but I can't. I can't even wish you well because I know you will continue to exploit and hurt others for your own benefit. I CAN say that you didn't conquer me and you didn't ruin our lives. We are stronger than ever after what you put us through. We will move on and love again with freedom and happiness.\n\n-See Ya Never \ud83d\ude18", "subreddit": "NarcissisticAbuse"}

Once I start, I only stop when the other person stops arguing. \n\nSomeone in my circle of friends is quite distant and often yells and acts annoyed, which I know it's their personality, but one time I got extremely annoyed at the fact that they called me names and started yelling at me because I mixed things said in a convo since I had to leave for a bit to take care of something important. I apologized for my mistake and they kept yelling, so I yelled back and if it wasn't the intervention of other two friends to end things there, we would've probably kept going.\n\nIs this a normal trait showed by abused people?

It took me two years to even consider that they could be right. My parents are emotionally abusive, and I don't know how to deal with it. They constantly belittle me, and make jokes about my weight (I'm 118 lbs and 5'4) and the fact that I find it hard to express my feelings. There have been some occasions where my dad will lose his temper, and hurt either me or my brother. I've been hurt a lot less, due to the fact that my dad believes that men shouldn't hit women, but there have been times where he's lashed out at me. They make fun of my brother's intelligence (Who is 9 as of now) and my dad constantly \"play fights\" with him, even though most of the play fights result in my brother sobbing and begging my dad to let him go. He only stops because he either gets sick of my brother's sobbing, or I tell him to stop and he storms off. We have no privacy, either. My parents constantly barge into my room, take my phone and go through everything, even my personal conversations with my friends, and they've even discussed taking my door away because I wasn't working as fast on my homework as they wanted me to. I want to get help, but I'm scared to. Not only am I scared, but there's also almost no way I can get help. I'm 15, live in the country, and I've been recently home-schooled by my parents and don't really have any contact with my friends any more. They've stressed me to the point of getting into a habit of self harming. But It's more anger and stress induced, to the point that I feel like I'm not in my right mind when doing it. I hate myself for what I'm doing to my body, but it helps me. It almost immediately relieves my pain. But then I think about how my brothers would see me and I become deeply ashamed of myself. I don't know what to do, I feel like we're trapped. I may be out of the house in three years, but my brothers are going to be stuck here probably having worse treatment than me. And the thing is that they can be incredibly loving and compassionate when they want to be. My mom may not be physically affectionate, but she can be so loving. My dad can also be very loving. I love them so much, but at the same time want to escape them. I'm so conflicted and I would like some advice.

(Long)", "author": "Scared_Perspective", "self_text": "So heres a little backstory. I'm a 14m who has been diagnosed with depression and has been going to a therapist for almost a year. When I was 6 my father was diagnosed with terminal brain cancer that he died from within a year. Being such a young child it didn't really hit me like it should have and I don't think I ever came to peace with his death. Immediatly after my father passed my mother married a very manipulative man. He managed to convince her to marry him within a few months dating him. Once they got married we moved in with him so I had to leave my friends and switch schools. He had 3 kids who were all older than me and never talked to me. I would try to start conversations and they would ignor me. I would try to tell my step father about that and he would lie and say he would talk to them about it and then he never did. I would try to talk to my mother about it but she was either too fixated on the fact that she was married or too drunk to care. My mother got a divource almost a year ago and we have since moved back home. We still had our old house but my brother and his family were there so we kicked them out and now I barely see my brother or his children. Only a few months after we moved back my house flooded and we have since been moving from apartment to apartment every month until it is fixed.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow to get into the actual abuse part of it. My mother has gone through two different phases of abusing me. When she married my step father she became like him and ignored me. It really hurt my self image and made me feel like I wasn't even worth the attention of my own mother. Now that we have moved out she has gone from 0 straight to 100 and become the most agressive person I've ever met. Obviously I don't have a lot of respect for her because of everything that has happened, but I do my best to be as civil as I can to her. She will pick anything out of something I've said and use it as a reason to yell at me. She brings up past mistakes I've made and yells at me like I've just done them. When I don't do exactly as she says she will either threaten to call the police or threaten to hurt me. I don't yell at her, but god forbid I use a stern tone to get my point across. If I do that then she actually hits me. She claims that when she does she just gets worked up and doesn't actually want to hurt me but I call bull on that. She knows what she is doing. when she hits me she only hits me open handed and she only hits me on my chest or back. She is trying to inflict the most amount of pain without leaving marks that would indicate that she hit me. She also throws stuff at me to scare me, but she will only throw my things. She intentionally will not throw things that she doens't want broken. People throwing things in the heat of the moment don't think about that.And if I try to push her away, she yells as loud as she can that I'm attacking her. She justifies yelling at me and hitting me by saying that she has a lot on her shoulders and she can't be expected to act like a normal person. She lies to almost everyone in our family and says that she never does anything, I always start things. She has bascially turned everyone in our family against me. Everyone who doesn't side with her and instead wants to atleast hear my side of it, she will bar them from ever seeing me. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMost of her abuse is emotional but it's been going on for years and I'm at the point where I'm almost constantly contemplating killing myself. She has even told me multiple times that I either make her want to kill herself, or that she would be happier if I didn't exist. It's also really hard to pinpoint if she's even in the wrong or not when everyone in your family is telling you that you're wrong and she's right. I just want to be happy but I don't even know how to be happy or what I did to deserve to be unhappy.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo do you think I'm being abused by my mother or am I just a bad person?", "subreddit": "abuse"}

It was some born-again group where around 80% of the congregation were single/ divorced mothers.  I remember thinking they were odd at the time but had no idea how creepy the whole thing was.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI had been masturbating for a while, and one night had a wet dream.  I tried to hide my soiled underpants but some cum stains were on the sheets and this really tipped mom over the edge.  When I got home from school she belted my ass and lectured me for ages on the evil sin of playing with myself - in front of my younger brother!  I was too scared to do it that night (I was jerking off 2-3 times a day at that point) and she told me before bed that she \"would take steps to ensure I didn't do it ever again\".  I had no idea what that involved.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe next morning - and I will NEVER forget this, she summoned me into the bathroom.  Told me how she had to get the evil seed out of me and make sure that I didn't play with myself or \"soil my sheets with my filth\".  I was told to lower my pants and bend over the sink in the bathroom - and being an obedient 13yo boy I did.  She explained that she was going to \"milk the evil out of me\" and do this every day to ensure I didn't sin anymore, or think sinful thoughts.  She sat behind me on a stool and I felt a cold wet finger at my rear - which she worked into my butt.  I had no idea what she was doing or why, and was too shocked/ overwhelmed to even protest.  She said that I was not to touch my penis no matter what, and keep both hands on the sink or I would get a spanking like nothing before.  Her finger went in further and hurt at first, but eventually touched a spot that felt VERY Good (of course I now know that it was my prostate).  I don't know how long she worked it for - maybe 2 minutes or maybe 15 it's all a blur, but she pressed and rubbed on it and it felt good until eventually I came and spat my cum into the sink, gasping and nearly crying.  I felt really emotional in a way that I never had before when climaxing.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe did this to me 2-3 times a day, morning and night, from the age of 13 until I was 17 and she had a complete breakdown and was put into an institution for a while.  We still don't speak.  She also did it to my brother for a few years once he hit puberty, and would make him wait outside until she had done me, then send me out so she could milk him.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow I feel really weird about this but I really looked forward to it most of the time because it felt so good.  She never touched my cock or balls, only put her finger in my butt.  Nothing \"sexual\" ever happened.

{"post_id": "e6yjyn", "created_utc": 1575637774, "title": "Narcissists and financial inequality?", "author": "polkadottedfox", "self_text": "\nI read a lot of stories about narcissistic partners either earning all of the money and controlling it, or being financial leeches. Mine makes 3x what I make, but still has me paying for half of all our living costs. He had me believe for a loooooong time (nearly 10 years) that any other way would be very unfair and wrong. Here\u2019s part of my story, and I\u2019m curious if this is something more people experience with narcissists in some form.\n\nWe bought a house together only 6 months into our relationship. I didn\u2019t want to buy it at first, I actually didn\u2019t want to buy a house together at all that early in the relationship, and this was a house way over my budget, on my own I could have never in my life afforded it. But an important detail, this house was my childhood home that I had very fond memories of. \nHe eventually convinced me, saying it was a once in a lifetime opportunity, and he assured me that together we made more than enough to pay for it, which is true. Plus I thought I had found my soul mate! We did talk finances and eventually agreed we would pay an equal portion of our income monthly. He kept reassuring me everything would be fine.\nI did have some money at that time (some 30.000 euros from the sale of a previous house). Since he would be paying more monthly I used that to pay for all of the buyer costs (around 6% of the house price here), and what was left I used to pay more than we agreed for the first few months. I still felt guilty that he would be paying substantially more than I would in the future, so in the first 6 months after buying the house I paid 50% of all monthly costs with the money I had left. \nWhen this money ran out I told him, and got a big shock. He acted very surprised and said we had agreed to each pay half, and that he had been afraid for a while this would happen. I was very confused to say the least, asked him if he didn\u2019t remember talking about this a LOT, and me being concerned about him having to pay more, etcetera. He told me that perhaps in my enthusiasm I had heard what I wanted to hear, that my memory of it was different from his, and that it seemed I misunderstood what he meant. That his understanding was that I meant I was going to make more money by now, and that he understood that I hadn\u2019t been able too do so yet, but that I really should start working on it, because he wanted an equal relationship (he did always talk about equality, just not in this context!). He also said that I had wanted this house soooooo bad, and that\u2019s why he agreed to buy it (it was his idea!!!). Even \u2018confessed\u2019 to feeling pressured. Now he hadn\u2019t been anything but easy going and understanding up to this point, so I seriously started doubting myself. Especially because he didn\u2019t get angry, he actually managed to act very understanding and hurt at the same time. The anger later did surface, although he\u2019s mostly very passive aggressive, and whenever I bring up any money issues I get the \u2018fact\u2019 that I made him buy a way too expensive house he didn\u2019t want thrown in my face. Or that I think I have a right to someone else\u2019s hard earned money. \nI paid. And continued paying. I make *just* enough to pay my half of the bills, the rest goes to groceries/food (which I buy mostly), and I have zero spending money. He has, after paying his half of everything, some 2000 euros left every month for spending money. He lives like a king, I live like a beggar, but he calls it equality. I haven\u2019t been able to buy clothes for myself in years, he has more clothes than he could ever wear. He spends every dime he earns. Buys me some nice clothing (no basics, *nice* things, like an expensive dress or coat once or twice a year, and then throws it in my face I don\u2019t appreciate it and everything nice I own is paid for by him. \nHe has gotten really good at preventing me from working any more than just enough to pay for my half, anything more gets sabotaged. Cleaning, cooking, laundry, everything around the house is my job. And it\u2019s my fault. Because he has tried to do things sooooooo many times, but I don\u2019t appreciate it and only comment on it. And that HURTS him. If I comment on anything or even suggest he does something different he\u2019ll never do it again. Says he works soooo much more than me, so I should do the cleaning. If I say that\u2019s not equality either then I should try to work more and then he\u2019ll clean. Then when I work more and he eventually does clean or do laundry it\u2019s me commenting on him again and I should do it myself if nothing else is ever good enough. Oh and I did try not commenting on it and telling him I appreciate it, but then I\u2019m either being sarcastic, or I\u2019m not happy enough about it. Whatever I do, I can\u2019t get out of our financial \u2018agreement\u2019.\n\nSorry for the very long post, but it feels good to write it down.", "subreddit": "NarcissisticAbuse"}

There was always something that felt like someone is making joke out of me, being ignorant, living wih other people, not just by themself. It was both of my extroverted flatmates. \n\nWe figured out that while one fletmate was constantly away traveling, other 4 have 2 kind of personalities: 2 extravert that are ignorant to others and 2 introverts that are too sensitive and have higher sense for empaty as others two. \n\nWhen me and flatmate ( the introverts ) figured this out was hard but easier at the same time since we knew what are we dealing with. I have talked to the reasonable extrovert which didnt know how to think, but at least tried to meet me/us half way by understanding of meeting the standards of living with other people ( tiddiying up for yourself). \nBecause of the pressure of unresonable extrovert, which I recognise as a narcisisst, the introvert flatmate moved out. And we got anoher which is amazig but doesnt know what he moved into. Before he did there was a bigtime drama of relationships in appartment when we figured out that I\nAm the target of the narcissist in WG. I am not sure if everybody got it as I did literarly, but for sure all felt the vibe except he, ofcourse. He blamed me for being the worse person while he is the weakest, the bedt intention, the smartest and most powerful person at the same time. \nEveryone else lost hope or didnt want to deal with it, while I decided to try not to care and just ignore. \n\nBit because previous flatmate moved out, I am now the only target of the narcissist. \n\nOf course I could move out, this would probably be the easiest. But I dont want that. I have a lovely room, with all of my stuff I dont really want to move out anywhere, I dont want to deal with searching new appartment because I love this one. I dont want to be attached to appartment too, but the most i dont want is to me, having to deal with all this moving sh** because one person having power over me or situation. \n\nSo I am trying to be better then this in to gigured out different ways. \n\nI am interested in mental illness and psychology overall and I find this as a personal and professional challenge. I allready noticed that I have changed a lot and I am stronger as I was. \n\nTrying to read as much as I can about narcissisem, and trying to ignore whatever narcisist does seems like a good plan in theory, but sometimes I too am only a human and I fall this practice being triggered by him. \n\nWhat is there for me to do?\nShould I really just ignore him and wait for him to give up and move out? Is this the only good plan I vould have?\n\nShould I play the rough game and try to piss him off to move out asap?\n\nI tried to be patient and to believe that we will sort things out as humans with didcussing and comunicating but apparently thats just spending my hope and energy.  Its not worth it and some times is ok if you decide to not solve every prblem in the world to save yourself. \n\nI really dont want to move out and I believe everything would sort out if he moves out. \n\nBut saying all this I am scared he will not just become verbaly agressive as he is but psyhical too, or that he will broke or steal any of my things from my room or appartment. \n\nDoes anyone else experienced anything simmilar?\n\nWhat have you done?\n\nIf you find yourself in my story, be strong, you got this \ud83e\uddbe", "subreddit": "NarcissisticAbuse"}

Whoever reads this first will be the first person to know about this aside from my father and I.\n\nI'm 25 now, and some recent stresses have caused my least favorite set of memories to resurface. I've been willfully ignoring them until this point, only recalling little bits and pieces but choosing not to go further each time. I usually have a spotty memory of my childhood (which may very well be the result of natural memory culling, I'll admit), but these memories have always been vivid. I've been doing a lot of self-reflection as of late, and they're starting to come up so often that I need to address them.\n\n**Context**\n\nI grew up in what my school called the \"Christian Bubble\", meaning we went to Christian school every weekday and church every Sunday. (Please don't turn this into a thread about religious abuse, by the way, because that's not related to my question here. My school was actually pretty cool and progressive compared to stereotypical Christian schools.)\n\nFor some reason, my parents decided to circumcise my brother but not me. Because literally every person I knew as a child was a Christian, I was the *only* boy I had ever seen who had foreskin. (In Western Protestantism, it's believed that being circumcised is a sign of belonging to the first covenant of God.) My parents also brought us to Christian medical practices, so the only other people who saw my penis were people who told me I would need to eventually get my foreskin removed.\n\n**The \"Check-Ins\"**\n\nFrom a pretty young age, my dad would check in on the health of my penis. He would find a time things weren't too busy, pull me aside, and ask me if I've been pulling my foreskin back. I was never able to get it all the way down because it hurt, but it was important to clean it so he would ask relatively often. It's hard for me to gauge how often, though, because I was a kid and kid time moves much slower than adult time.\n\nI would tell my dad I was trying but that it hurt. (And it really did, by the way--as a kid, the sting of touching the exposed glans was terrible.) Eventually he started asking me to show him I could do it. He would bring me into the bathroom when things weren't too busy, and he would ask me to pull down my pants and prove I could do it. Sometimes he would sit there and coach me on how to pull it back if I couldn't get it or if I complained about it hurting. I hated doing all of this, and I would usually put up a fuss. I never asked my mom about it because it was too embarrassing. Bear in mind, I was the alien with the weird penis.\n\n(Edit: at the beginning he would sometimes hold it and try to show me, but I started reacting poorly to that so stopped touching me as I did it. One time he did say \u201cif it will help, I can take off my pants too\u201d. I can\u2019t tell if he said this to make me feel less alone or whether it was something different.)\n\nIt's hard to say how long this continued because I started forgetting the instances deliberately after a while. It could have been until I was eight, or it could have been until I was ten. I have no clue, but I'm absolutely sure these memories are real.\n\n**Other Stuff**\n\nI've always been the weird kid, and I've always feared physical intimacy. I had my first kiss at the age of 21 with my now-wife. This is a surprise to most people because on the surface, I'm actually pretty good-looking and well manicured. (Not bragging, just being honest.) I was diagnosed with ADHD at a young age, and I've always displayed OCD symptoms which were officially diagnosed a year ago. (Edit: the ADHD is probably unrelated. I brought it up because maladaptive daydreaming has always been an issue for me.)\n\nThroughout my life, I've never felt fully human. I hate admitting it, but it's true. I've especially distrusted men because I'm somewhat effeminate. I don't feel safe around them. My first \"crushes\" were physical objects, and I had some weird sexual behaviors I'm not sure were normal. I also had to wear Pull-Ups until I was 10 because I would wet the bed frequently. It was embarrassing.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI don't know. I love my dad. Aside from those encounters, he's never been unkind. He's supportive and loving. I just...I don't know. I still hate thinking about it. I don't know what's normal. I still struggle sexually with my wife because I fear the physical discomfort of sex.

Any advice or encouragement appreciated", "author": "threetwentyfizzle", "self_text": "First off, I'm new to this sub. I came here after a revelation that the woman I was seeing off and on for the past year was putting me through a cycle of narcissistic abuse. I want to share my story and hope somebody who may have gone through something similar could share any wisdom or encouragement for me to gain the strength to put this behind me so I can finally move on...\n\nA little background on me.. I'm (31M). I would describe myself as being an empath, semi introverted. I was in a bad marriage for 4 years that ended after I discovered my ex wife cheated on me, and was rarely intimate with me. Took me a while to move on from that and I didn't start dating for nearly a year and a half. I'm only mentioning these things for added context. Being cheated on numerous times by my ex wife, and becoming somewhat introverted made the idea and process of dating and meeting people seem like a nearly impossible task for me.\n\nI eventually put myself out there, and met the woman this post is about on Bumble a little over a year ago. I found her to be very attractive and was immediately smitten by her. She had a couple pictures showing off her ass, but I didn't think much of it at the time because of the dating app. \n\nWe immediately hit it off, we shared great chemistry, seemed like we had a lot in common, the love, sex, her affection towards me seemed to be perfect. But there were some things that didn't add up that I naively overlooked that were red flags that she did admit to me early on.. \n\nShe did webcamming to make money. She lived with her ex bf. He was abusive to her. They both were recovering addicts and she was on methadone. He used her for her money. She also posted a LOT of very over sexualized and revealing pics on Snapchat and Instagram, stuff that I wasn't comfortable with. She stopped posting them for a while for me. She was VERY attentive to me, told me she loved me very early into our relationship, and would constantly ask me if I was going to leave her, would get upset with me if I didn't text her back fast enough, stuff like that. It was becoming a bit too much for me, so I broke up with her after a few months. \n\nThis is when the cycle started. And it has gotten worse and WORSE each time. She would reach out to me after a month or 2 of us being broken up. Tell me she missed me, still loves me, asks for another chance. I always give in, because I legitimately fell in love with her. I always fall for her sweet words, like an idiot.. The first time we got back together, things were good, like we never broke up. We spent a lot of time together again. But she gradually started posting more provocative pics of herself on Snapchat, essentially naked, talking to  guys, accepting gifts from them, so many things that I have tried to suppress and forget. I broke up with her AGAIN for this. \n\nBasically, the cycle keeps repeating. She reaches out to me, I can't stop thinking about her, I give in cuz I loved her and wishfully think she's honest and serious about what she tells me. But it had gotten so much worse and emotionally abusive to me. She would start flaking on plans with me, disappearing on me and ghosting me at night, never answer the phone when I called her, never tell me what she's up to, post her naked ass and tits seeking attention from guys, yet still tell me she loves me and wants me and really mess with my head. I get fed up, even angry, and walk away. And the cycle has repeated on and on and on. I haven't even physically seen her or spent time with her since July and she's still playing these games with me.... \n\nI have barely scratched the surface on everything that she's put me thru, all the lies and things that doesnt add up and seems off, there is too much that I can't list it all. Im convinced she's either still with her \"ex\" or sleeping around with other guys. She gave me an STD in the spring and tried blaming me. When I call her out on her bullshit, she always has a poor excuse that doesn't add up.\n\nI need to move on, I need to heal. I need to stay strong and not take the bait... It seems like a sick game to her, and I'm pretty sure she's just playing me for attention.", "subreddit": "NarcissisticAbuse"}

I don't respond, and the few times I have I've been cold and not inviting any further conversation. About two months ago my NEX had a baby with a random hookup and they are now trying to date for the child's sake. (NEX obviously doesn't make good decisions) This new girl and I have never met but she came into my place of work. \n\nI work at a bar and was bartending when she sat down. Immediately she was rude and aggressive even rolling her eyes at me and at times not even answering me. I tried to shrug it off as just another drunk asshole but when I'd turn away she'd whisper 'stupid ass bitch' ect under her breathe. It was at that point I started to feel mildly threatened and worried it was gonna escalate. Thankfully it didn't, she left, didn't tip, and threw her bill at me. I had to take a break to calm down because I thought this was a random person but I had the thought that I should look this person up online since I had her name from the receipt. Sure enough it was my NEXS baby mama, or new supply. \n\nI reached out to my NEX for the first time in a year and half and basically said: 'I've done nothing wrong to deserve feeling threatened where I work. I'd appreciate you taking care of whatever is going on immediately'\n\nAnd boooy did his lackluster response remind me why he's literally fucking terrible. \n\nHis said he had no idea why she would do that and they don't even talk about me.

I scrolled up to where literally a month before he sent me how much me missed me ect. It just brought me right back to the rollercoaster of never knowing what he really meant or felt.

THERE WILL BE SOME TRIGGERING STUFF IN THIS POST SO IF YOU ARE SENSITIVE TO SUBJECTS OF SELF HARM OR ABUSE PLEASE STOP READING\n\n\nSo yeah I am probably a really bad person for even thinking of my mother in such a negative way. And more than that. I feel that I want her to get hurt. I know that this is a terrible thing. But what would YOU do when your own mother calls you a mistake, a problem child, a suffering, a disappointment, a whore, slut, idiot, dumbass, retarded bitch and that she wishe you were dead. And then goes back to praising you.\nWell recently things have been getting worse.\n\nEver since I was young she would always tell me she was tired and that I was tiring her out. And she was really really clingy and anxious. She does have anxiety disorder and mania. One time I remember she faked her death when I was 5 to teach me a lesson that I can't depend on her and what number to call for an ambulance in case we need it. I just now learned the number at age 19. For years all I remember was the sheer terror I felt of her dying. \nNow I won't deny I was a tough and clingy child myself. I must have been a PAIN to raise. And for me to turn out the way I did? No wonder she is disappointed. My mom was in and out of hospitals for health issues for YEARS. And that really left me wondering why this was happening to me. To her. Ironically enough I hated and despised hospitals growing up but I work in them now. Well, I will cause right now I am studying to be a nurse. However idk how my relationship with my mother however will affect my work. I mean I am just writing about this and I am crying.  \n\nSo long story short. A few years back she went through a really tough surgery. She was in a lot of pain for weeks and idk know what to do other than study. She was already in her menopause phase so that made things even worse. Even though my dad was always taking care of her and helping her get through this she despises him and blames him for all her problems. For her health issues, for her surgeries for me. She blamed me for her previous formed cancer. When I was 15. But here comes the real kicker.\n\nAfter years of bickering and fighting with my parents, despite me never getting in any trouble in school etc etc and in general just trying my best to be a model person they still kept finding new things to nag about. That is a parent's job sure. But it got to a level that I would practise self harm. Eventually I stopped but now after scarring my mother. \n\nSo in general I am a terrible child and she is an overprotective mother who just adores her child enough to emotionally scar it for life and make her extremelly scared of violence because you never know when she is gonna struck you. And let's not forget goody ol father.\n\nI sweat that bastard doesn't know anything about me. He doesn't know which school I went to for primary school, he doesn't know my past times, my friends etc. He never bothered so I never bothered with him. If he wants to be distant then I'll be distant. And let's not forget his constant need to comment on my weight, attitude, hair, look, clothes, way of sitting, way of talking, way of thinking, way of eating and lack of self care. Yeah I tend to neglect my self a lot recently. But i don't care anymore. \n\nBut here's the kicker in case you didn't already think I was an entirely trash person, as my sweet sweet mother says. When she was ill and was in the first stages of cancer (she is better now thank god) I didn't feel anything. I didn't know what to think. I didn't know how to feel. All I know is that I wasn't even shocked, if I was it was not as bad as I had thought. \n\nI am a bad child, a terrible person and a god awful everything.\n\nBut hey my parents aren't any better either. One of them doesn't care about me and the other cares too much about me. Either way we always fight, I am always in the wrong for being too slow/fat/dumb/moronic/childish/petty/wrong/naive/lazy/bulimic (according to my mom the \"expert\" in mental health issues)/ stoic/boring/angry/sad etc etc.\n\nI hate myself as much as I hate my parents folks. And that says a lot.\n\nAnd the question is... Which one of us is the abuser? Because as of recently I start to feel like I am the abuser and that I caused all the problems in the family with my fucking existence. Like the moment I come in somewhere or get involved with someone, their lives get significantly worse. Idk anymore. \n\nAm I the abuser? Or are my parents? Or am I just overreacting? (Probably the third one according to some friends and etc etc.)\n\nSorry for the long, angry post guys. If you took the time to read it this far I really appreciate it. No joke. Either way you can answer my question if you want or not idk. Depends on you. Either way have a good rest of the day/month/year. See you later.", "subreddit": "emotionalabuse"}

My ex and I were together for almost two years and it was the most toxic relationship I\u2019ve been in. It takes being out of the relationship and looking back to realize how bad it was. It started out well of course, like they all do, he was 19 and I was 27 at the time. He was smart, fit and good looking. When the emotional abuse started it was small and it was controlling. I have 2 kids, I have tattoos, and I of course have had previous sexual partners, all of which he didn\u2019t like and would put me down for. He would make fake phone numbers and text me pretending to be my ex boyfriend to test me and see what I would say. He asked me to laser off my sleeve because he never saw him being with someone who has tattoos. \n\nHe did the classic \u201cno one will ever love you the way I love you\u201d and \u201cI am the best you will ever get, do you think you deserve the best after everything you\u2019ve done\u201d. He broke me down mentally till I was just a shell of the strong woman I once thought I was.\n\nWe would fight very often, probably every few days. I\u2019d wake up to breakup texts from him and beg him to stay, to love me. There were times I\u2019d tell him to leave and try to get him out of my house. He\u2019d pin me against the wall till I no longer had the energy to push him out the door. One time I told him not to come to my house and I put a heavy couch against the wall blocking the door and he forced his way in. He threatened to burn everything he ever got me. But in my mind none of it was physical... so I stayed.\n\nThere is so much more that happened but this post isn\u2019t about that. Just recently I found out that he murdered someone. He was out drinking and someone he didn\u2019t know was helping him get an Uber. He shot him in the face and the shot him again in the head when he was on the ground. When they asked him why, he said he disrespected him. There was a flood of emotions when I read the article, but the biggest emotion was relief. Relief that it wasn\u2019t me, that he was off the streets and I never have to worry about him dropping by the house again. It could have been me, honestly, it probably would have been me. \n\nI wanted to share this for anyone who may be going through this.

He knew how to reel me back in no matter how much he destroyed my sense of self worth from the last discard.\n\nNo more. Never again. \n\nI have blocked his phone number, Snapchat, (he doesn\u2019t have Instagram), and unfollowed him on Facebook. I know the best thing to do would be to block him on Facebook, but for some reason (probably not a good one) I want to stay friends with him on FB. I think part of the reason may be because after the first discard I did unfriend him on Facebook and he thought I was being really over dramatic and crazy. He didn\u2019t know why we couldn\u2019t remain Facebook friends and really thought I was overreacting. I told him it was because it hurts too much to be reminded of him every time I go on Facebook. I still feel this way but now I almost want to prove to him that being reminded of him doesn\u2019t hurt me, so I don\u2019t need to block him. \n\nLet me know your thoughts. I know most of you will definitely support me blocking him, and I am open to hearing why / getting convinced. \n\nI appreciate this group so much, every time I am doubting or questioning myself regarding my relationship with my Nex, this group reminds me that I am NOT CRAZY.", "subreddit": "NarcissisticAbuse"}

If these disagree with him, I\u2019m accused of \u201cdisrespect\u201d. As the biblical leader of our home, I am supposed to be submissive. But this means I\u2019m supposed to be meek and gentle and compliant with his every whim.

And when he does a big \u201cfuck you!\u201d to me, I have a hard time not giving it right back. And so we fight because there\u2019s a spirit in me that isn\u2019t broken and a realization that I still share a 50% stake in this relationship. But at the end of the fight, I\u2019m always the one who made him do and say what he said, and I\u2019m evil and horrible for cussing back, fighting back. There\u2019s never been a time where he can admit he started it, or even admit that he contributed to it or that we\u2019ve both been assholes. I\u2019m always the one with the problem. I\u2019m always the one who is crazy and out of control. \n\nHe calls my mother when I won\u2019t back down or agree and manipulated her into agreeing with him and scolding me. He involves my father too sometimes for good measure. Then they call and text and fuss at me and tell me I\u2019m wrong. \n\nHe won\u2019t call his own parents because he is \u201cprotecting me from them seeing who I really am.\u201d\n\nI am his third wife. The other two marriages ended he claims because of the women, they were terrible and selfish and evil and he just has the misfortune of picking terrible women. \n\nWhat\u2019s my only recourse? Shutting down and avoiding triggering him? Becoming numb and it having opinions or emotions? I gave up my city, my apartment, my job, to move into his house and his city and get a job here. He so often threatens to kick me out and that he will tell my parents to come get me. He loves to remind me how this is HIS house. But I\u2019m the villain when I get fed up and say I can\u2019t do this anymore. And he only tells me to get out he says when I say it first. Not true. \n\nRecently we were in bed and I started whining that it was cold in the middle of the night when I was half asleep. He decided to argue that no it wasn\u2019t cold and I wasn\u2019t cold I was being a child. This made me angry because how is this an argument? I was half asleep so I didn\u2019t realize I was angering the beast by insisting that it was indeed cold in the room by getting up and turning on a space heater and sitting in front of it and he grabbed me by my hair and threw me across the room, shaking me, pushing my head into the ground, holding his fist back like he would hit me. I started sobbing and he told me to stop crying or he was throwing me out of his house in my bathrobe in 20 degree weather. He stormed out of the room and I just cried because I was hurt and shocked and he stormed back in and grabbed and shook me again, started dragging me by my hair and robe, telling me to get the fuck out of his house, that he was throwing me into the cold. This is when I started apologizing and saying I was wrong and sorry I upset him, that I shouldn\u2019t have been complaining. He apologized too for doing that but it was my fault for pushing his buttons. \n\nI\u2019ve been in relationships before with this kind of man who hit, shove, rough up, when argued with. They always say the same thing: you pushed my buttons and if you hadn\u2019t pushed my buttons I wouldn\u2019t have done that. \n\nI just feel alone right now.

If so, how?", "author": "[deleted]", "self_text": "Hi all, I don't really have anywhere else to ask this, I don't know what I can do and I'm worried about my friend. Please excuse this essay I'm about to write but I want to outline in detail the pattern of behaviour to make things as clear as possible.\n\nMy friend and I used to be really close. We would share our problems,  lament past relationships, talk about life and the state of the world  as it is and so on. We hung out *a lot* and we propped each other up when one  was down or on hard times and life was good.\n\nBut a few months ago he just ditched. He stopped talking to me practically overnight and if I tried to talk to him all I got were a  few dismissive sentences that didn't allow for much further conversation. We stopped hanging out and he stopped lifting. I soon found out it was because he'd met a girl.\n\nI was quickly introduced to this girl (N). As she quickly pushed her way in and announced herself as my friends closest friend and the one person in the world he can talk to and rely on. Fake, high pitched voice that disappeared when she spoke to me. Promises she'll never keep, and she's isolated him from his  friends and family. Everything she says is with a sneer and behind a thin layer of faux politeness.\n\nWhat's worse is that not only was she in a relationship when they  met, but she openly admits and brags thats she has another 6 guys on the go, but describes it as 'broadening her horizons'. She doesn't have sex with them she assures everyone, they just buy her things for 'no  reason'. At least 4 of these guys are overseas (including friend and  myself), as she's careful to check they don't live too close to her  before she starts trying to get in their wallet.\n\nHer pattern of behaviour is to join an online group, usually on something like Discord, and take over or control the conversation. She will filter out the people that pay her attention and start with the love bombing. If no one pays attention to her or she finds she can't control the conversation, she leaves the chat and says everyone was stuck up or nasty to her. Then she'll start love bombing these guys until they start buying her gifts and paying a little too much attention to and then she'll discard them when she's found new supplies.\n\nShe posts pictures and screenshots of chats from these other guys and makes fun of them. When she was trying to get into my wallet she spent a large amount of time showing me pictures of my friend (not lewd) and making fun of him. His weight, his accent, his tattoo, his hair, his laugh. Literally everything about my friend she would make fun of. And I spent the whole time sticking up for him and telling her that the things she was saying weren't fair, and if she didn't like anything about him, why is she spending so much time talking to him? Her response was \"because he's nice and he needs me, he has no one else\".\n\nShe tried to add me to her harem but since I wasn't offering her attention, sex or money I served no use to her, so she went out of her way to make my  life difficult and worked to destroy what remained of the friendship  between my friend and I. When I tried to step out of the situation, she started bombing my friend harder with fake concern about hoping I was okay and \"I don't understand why Sky has left\". Every time my friend and I would have a conversation, she would jump in, change the topic to something that was centered on her, and then disappear.\n\nShe  openly makes fun of my friend, she belittles him, and treats him like  he's some kind of child. She tells him what to do and calls him  a 'Good boy' when he does it. I've been completely astounded that the  spine my friend had when we were hanging out has just completely gone now that he's got this girl ordering him around. He's stopped lifting,  he stopped trying to write his novel, he stopped trying to get his  education back after his ex girlfriend screwed him over (gaslighted,  cheated, aborted his baby and ran off with the guy she was cheating  with). All he does now is play video games and if she demands it, he  will play whatever she wants. All motivation he had for life is gone.\n\nLast time I tried to tell him what was going on and that his new friend makes fun of him, his response was  basically 'Okay lol' and we've stopped talking or hanging out since then. We've hung out once, where he stuck around playing video games for  about 2 hours before he told me he needs a break and we haven't spoken  since.\n\n2 weeks ago he messaged me saying it's been a long time and asking  how it was going. When I responded that I was okay and asked how he was  doing I've had no response.\n\nI'm worried about my friend, I know this gold digger/narcissist has her claws in  somehow but I don't know what to do. She's since broken up with her  boyfriend, and now just seems to be clinging onto my friend, even though  she openly told me she can't stand anything about him.\n\nIs there a way to tactfully tell my friend what's going on, or show him what she is? I'm worried that he's going to get hurt by another one of these people and it's destroying me to watch. What baffles me more is that there's no romantic connection going as far as I know. My friend just knows this girl online but will do anything she says because he's a people pleaser and very trusting.\n\nOr do I just stick around and help support him when she's finished with him?", "subreddit": "NarcissisticAbuse"}

I sort of just poured my heart out on this one letting everything out. \n\nI'm a female in her 20's. I've only been in 2 relationships ever in my life. My ex and my husband. I'm 5'2 if that matters and have tan skin. I'm European mixed with black, thus speaking Russian, and Ukrainian were my first languages as I have no affiliation with the black side of my family at all in any way. I look very much European as well other than having a tan colored skin and dark hair and eyes. (Forgive my errors, English is not my 1st language and don't type in English much since high school. I primarily type in Japanese or Russian to friends.) \n\nAnyways, my first relationship was with a white guy that has dirty blonde hair and blue eyes. Average size, 5'8 We'll call him J. J is 2 years younger than me and I met him a few days after turning 18. I took his virginity after a few weeks of dating, in early September. The odd thing is the day we met he asked for a cookie and I gave it to him not thinking much and he moaned and then ran off. Later he went back to my table and followed me since very closely and that's how we became attached. \n\nThe relationship was fine. I did notice quickly he had anger issues and punched my bed and I told him to talk about it with me and that I'm there. Then on Halloween we did stuff as we participated in our school stuff like I did haunted house for the Japanese club. We had sex in the school hallway underneath the stairs. I have no idea how we weren't caught. Teenage hormones and reason of where sex logically goes away lol. Later that day I notice he was going to go visit someone and he said he was sorry and stuff. So I went with his brother to McDonalds and we ate a meal together. His brother and I are friends. We later went to my house and got changed into other clothes and trick or treated (People mistake me for a middle schooler all the time so I can always pass off as younger than I actually am even still to this day) After that his brother and I bonded more as I noticed my bf payed more attention to other girls than me but then got extremely jealous when his brother kept me company. I thought maybe it wouldn't work out and we should stay friends. \n\nI then see he forgot to log off Facebook and I see messages between some girl we'll call Z. I was going to tab out as I'm not the type to sneak on other peoples stuff, but then I see messages written in a way that something happened but they were very careful with words. I then scrolled up and saw on Halloween that he and her had sex and he asked her how it was and all this stuff and if she felt good. I nearly lost my shit as he later came over and I told him I knew what she was doing with him. I then asked what he did on Halloween and he said he was with his mom. Then admitted to be with her, Then said she was too fat and he couldn't get it in. He game so many excuses and I was more mad of him lying than cheating. \n\nI then said we were done. He begged no and I told him to get out and that we were done. This made him go from sobbing to suddenly him saying he refuses to let me leave him. He looked mad and shoved me while saying he's been watching me and liked me before we met. He even said \"If I can't have you, no one can.\" Before beating me and raping me. Ever since then J would beat and rape me daily. Sexual things took up like 90% of the relationship we had. He lied about everything so much to the point that I never believed in anything he said. I didn't love him. I was miserable always making excuses of why I would have a bruise. He began taking me to church because his dad is one of those obsessed crazy Christians that go to church literally 4 days a week and chooses Church over his children and work. While there a few boys from the youth group who were in my high school. J convinced me to go in a closet with 2 of them and a third one saw us and then laughed and turned off the light and shut the door locking it. The closet is weird like hallway with props. The three of them touched me sexually and I was nervous and said no and not to do it in a church at all. After that they would often tell me to go in there and I'd hesitate and they would always threaten me or just drag me in there. They forced themselves on me around 2 times a week. J would sometimes record it but always liked finishing last as he said it was to \"reclaim me\". He also started selling me to a few other people. J also says I'm too skinny. I know he likes big girls and I was normal size. I was actually anorexic until I was 16 my average weight was 87 pounds. At this time I was like 120 pounds at 18. He always told me to eat more and got angry if I didn't. I began gaining weight fast because if I didn't finish the huge amount of food he gave me and sugar or sweets all the time, he would always hit me. \n\nIt wasn't until a year later J beat me so bad that I was hospitalized. He went to a mental institute because as police questioned him he pulled out the \"The voices tell me things\" move which made everyone think he was crazy. My eye was black and shut and my lip busted badly. After he got out he went to see me again where the first thing he did was do me after saying he missed me and loved me. I was pretty much a na\u00efve puppet of his at this point and emotionally dependent on him. July rolls around and on the 4th Z gets invited by his sister. I notice that Z is a good 300 pounds or a more which is what J likes. At this point I'm hitting around 200-210 pounds. I notice the two are gone and I needed to walk. I go behind the building on a side I typically don't take and there I see J and Z at it. His hands in her pants as they are both about to do the deed. I pretty much gasp getting their attention, he says it's not what it looks like. I walk away feeling my heart torn. I call my best friend we will call Ty. Ty is a Japanese guy who I've known for well over 10 years now. We met in elementary school and are super close. \n\nTy tells me that he always had a bad feeling and can't stand the guy and I should have left him the second Ty told me he didn't like the guy. He wants to fight the guy. (my friends are 99.9% male which is why I don't call any girls btw) J hates Ty as Ty and his eldest brothers were my first sexual anything, but that stopped. I get off the phone with Ty just as J walks around and says I saw nothing and he never cheated and he doesn't cheat. Then he says I'm the cheater, and how he's seem so many guys do me I'm pretty much a slut at this point. I yell at him that I never wanted any of that at all and he knows that. Then he said I deserved being ruined like that and how me crying and just giving in was the best and made it so much easier to make me just cling to him as he just consoled me after. I then get a call from 2 of my guy friends in a group call. we'll call G and W. I say hi and their names and suddenly feel nervous when I noticed J look at me with anger and haltered as he noticed it was guys who called me. Before this day, he had absolutely no problem with me being friends with any guys at all. I walk away while talking to them and go to the front of his property where no one was at all. The party moved to the back yard. \n\nI suddenly had a sinking feeling and told G and W that I had to go. As I turn off the phone I see J's shadow. I get so scared and hide behind the trees. This is in the North west pacific. So tree's here are HUGE. I then move bad and a twig snaps and I hear J suddenly run for me. He grabs me and tries to drag me but I scream I'm done with his cheating and lying and forcing me to do things I don't want to. I told him I'm leaving now, and that we're done. He slaps me so hard my glasses fly off my face. I push him away and try to run. He grabs me and I accidentally elbow him in the face. I chipped his tooth. Not much, it was just barely noticeable. He did almost a demonic sounding growl of anger before going after me again. I tried to run more but he grabbed me and punched me and kicked me repeatedly for maybe a minute. He only stopped when he was panting too hard and tired. I was sobbing and he was laughing and saying how much of a monster he became. I managed to get away from him and run into a bunch small trees using them to block and put distance between him and me. \n\nHe chased me out eventually and then pinned me again before suddenly getting on top of me and raping me. He told me to enjoy the fire works, then said something about him making sure I can never leave him and tie me to him forever. He came in me on purpose as I tried to fight and cried no and for him to stop and not finish in me as he revealed he will get me pregnant so I can never leave him. About a month later I found out I did become pregnant. I got an abortion after 10 weeks. I still have the ultrasound of the baby. I can't seem to get rid of it as I feel so bad and like I felt so wrong doing this, But I had no choice at all because I can't keep in contact with J and be abused like this. \n\nI finally managed to break it off at January of 2018 after he stole alcohol to try to frame his sister.  My family banned him and he convinced me to secretly meet up with him. Ty finally convinced me to stop meeting him and all this stuff. He said if I don't stop he wont stop and he will kill me. Ty said he doesn't want J to kill me as I'm all he has and the most important person to him. Me and J are beyond extremely close btw. During that time I guess Ty and me dated. I don't really know. Then in the middle of October J came with some random guy and they forced themselves in the house. The two of them raped and tortured me for hours. They would take their turn to rape me. Then took a break by either torturing me or talking to each other, then rape me again. This lasted a good 4 hours I think. My phone has a partial recording of it ear the last 40 minutes of it. \n\nTy called the police and I was taken to the hospital where I was in the emergency room for 2 days. I was cut, burned, had a concussion, and my vagina was torn and in a lot of pain. My grandma never left my side at all during the hospital visit. My mom was out of town and when she came back she grabbed a gun and was going straight to J's house to kill him screaming in Russian about how she doesn't give a fuck if she gets deported this time. My grandma had to grab the gun from her hand and take it away while screaming at her to not be ridiculous and all this stuff. 2 months later I meet a Asian man off tinder whos like 6'1 almost. I feel super tiny compared to him. He's extremely handsome and super fit. Like six pack abs and perfect in every way in my eyes. \n\nI was extremely nervous that he'd not be attracted to me because I'm 260 pounds at this point. I lost a good 30 pounds before meeting this guy. I was going internship at a veterinarian hospital as I did my vet assisting classes a year prior. I was so happy without J. My life was all the best at this point. I marry this Asian guy after 34 days of meeting him. He's super kind and nice. Always calm. His parents came from China for the wedding. I then notice he has anger issues as well as he suddenly one day yelled at his mom in Mandarin. They don't speak English at all. \n\nOne day while I was on the phone with TY, my husband suddenly acted weird and yelled at me in such a loud tone I've never heard him before. He slammed his fist on the bed and screamed at me over wanting to talk to me. He since then acted strange. Later I notice how (lets call him T) T starts throwing things when mad. We get in a few arguments here and there. He always says he's never hit a woman and never will. I eventually get a job in an Animal Hospital a few months later and one day he had a complication and couldn't take me to work. I can't drive. (No license). I was going call them, but T grabbed my phone and then suddenly grabbed my hair and shoved me hard onto the floor. I curled into a ball as he then pulled my hair back and forced me up and swung me. My face slammed into the wall and he then threw me to the floor. I was so shocked and he screamed at me in Mandarin. \n\nI don't think he's abusive. I didn't think he would get worse. Eventually I wasn't able to go outside. If I tried he'd react violently, by grabbing my hair and slamming me to the floor or carrying me back to the house if I did manage to escape. I was like 225 LBS now. So he can now carry me because of how strong and big he is compared to me. Eventually he hits me for the first time when I was visiting my parents and I accidentally snagged T's shirt and stretched it while we were wrestling. J finds my address somehow and breaks in to rape me one last time before my husband decided to move. We moved to the great city of Seattle that I was born and raised in almost my whole life. I actually live less than 5 blocks away from my first house my mom used to live in. I also had to leave my work because of it and be a house wife, thus making me completely dependent on him. \n\nThe first 3 days in a row of moving in he would punch and beat me for a minute because I would piss him off. Then everything was fine for a while. Our life became perfect as could be. He did slap me a couple times once if I yelled at him or started arguments. Then one day while he was washing dishes, I walked over to him to give him some more dishes. We had an argument because I was sick of him being a mama's boy and prioritizing her. He would talk to her for like 5 hours a day. They were so close it was borderline incest. They are like literally doing everything other than kissing or fucking. I almost left him because of that at one point and he stopped all physical interaction but the phone calls were ridiculous. He thought it was normal and didn't realize until I told him. \n\nSo anyways he was doing dishes (This was maybe a month ago) I called him out for talking to his mom for the 6th hour that day when I asked for help but he wanted to only talk to her. I never understand what they say since it's always in Mandarin. He ignored me and I just went to the sink and my hand slipped and I dropped the dish in the sink. He looked at me fast and he has this expression he has and sort of half freeze just before he attacks me and I knew right away I was going to get hit. I ran away and his hand grazed my hair just as I run away. He chases after me and slams me to the floor before I curl into a ball. His mom is screaming over the phone and he stops. \n\nThe next day he was talking to his mom and I was watching him cook as he's really bad at it. (He literally set pasta on fire), and I tried to talk and he ignored me and continued talking to his mom. I then just grab the piece of meat he's beginning to burn and it falls off the fork as I'm placing it on the plate and falls on the counter. He thought I did it intentionally and loses his mind. He ends the call and punches me right in the face before hitting my head and hands that I now covered my face. He then grabbed my hair and threw me against the fridge and things on it fell next to me as he then kicked me as I curled into a ball and cried and screamed. He then yelled at me that he can easily replace me but I can't replace him because I'm 100% dependent on him. I ran upstairs and he chased after me and kept wrestling me. I was getting clothes on to walk out, but he literally tore them off like the clothes were a napkin or something. He stripped me naked even breaking the hooks on my bra as he ripped it off me and yelled at me to stay. After that everything was fine. He always acts like it never happens. \n\nI don't think even he knows or realizes he's being bad. He hasn't hit me or insulted me for a while until 3 days ago while I was making food I accidentally dropped it while transferring the food from the pan to the plate. I began crying over it and he picked the food up and took it to his table. He told me to eat it. I was like wtf and asked why he doesn't care if I get sick. He just looks at me blankly and tells me to eat the food then he'll pay for the hospital bill when I get sick. This started an argument over him yelled at me that I made the mistake of dropping it and I need to eat the food off the floor. I screamed no and then he hit me in the face again. Then he shoved me making me fall sideways with the chair. I clime away from the chair just before he grabs me and pins me to the floor. He screamed at me demanding me an apology for yelling and refusing to eat food off the floor. I refused to and he put such a strong pressure on my wrists while holding me down I began screaming and begging him to stop. I then was putting on my clothes to leave after he get off me. He right away then began acting sexual and loving saying no and that he loves me and to kiss him. \n\nEvery time he tried to kiss me I would turn my head away and he looked at me with a smile. He eventually pinned me to the floor and began touching me and sucking on my breasts while kissing me as he told me to stay in the house and all this stuff. I finally said okay and pushed him off me. He then followed me upstairs and laid in bed for a few hours just on his laptop while I was on my computer. He then wanted to cuddle and sleep with me. Since then was the first time I realized what he is doing is abusive. Like... who gets mad at a person for refusing to eat food that was on the floor. \n\nI did forget to mention for a while I would often wake up with my underwear taken off or with me in awkward positions or sometimes with tissue between my legs. I took heavy sleeping pills at the time and T got mad if I refused to take them and even forcefully shoved them in my mouth and made me take it. I stopped taking them a few months ago and then that's when I noticed him getting on top of me at night and having sex with me. I was pretty perplexed at first but over tine got used to it. I rarely ever said anything about it. When I first asked him he would often deny it so much and get very defensive or just avoid the topic entirely. One time while I was visiting my parents trailer, (They have a huge camping trailer on another property in the middle of a forest) and they told us not to have sex because of how sensitive the trailer rocks. I said okay, so did T. Well... During the night I get woken up with him getting on top of me. I told him no, and he covered my mouth. I tried to push him off, but he pinned my arms down and then leaned his upper body on me. \n\nWe have such a huge height difference that if he lays on me during sex while he's on top, My face will be on his chest. He leaned on me to cover my mouth which awkwardly worked. And I struggled and tried to say no, but he did me. He didn't get off until he finished and was satisfied then rolled over like nothing happened and passed out less than 1 minute later. I couldn't fall asleep as I was shaking and wondering if he raped me or not. He did this a few times more but at home. \n\nThat's my abuse story. I never told anyone. I just wanted to talk about it, nothing else. Just letting it all out. With my husband things are actually much MUCH better than with my ex which I don't register it as being abuse or severe abuse because of it not being as bad. He and I also click too well together. Like all my flaws are his strength and vice versa. We are a perfect team. And most of the time are generally always calm and quiet. He's a very soft spoken man. T is 2 and a half years older than I am. No one knows he does this other than TY as I still regularly talk to him. \n\nThere are some mental stuff going on. Like my husband wanting me to lose weight, but then doesn't let me go anywhere or let me do anything to help me lose weight. Just everything he says he's doing out of good, he then prevents me doing it, then promises next time, then complains that I don't do it. It's just that cycle over and over again. I do know triggers he has. If I refuse to cook he gets extremely mad because he cant cook at all. Also if I don't let him sleep when he wants to he will snap. Then he calls me selfish and all this stuff if I try to do normal things or go against his schedule. I sell art, If I want to stay up later to finish a drawing he yells that I'm selfish and is mad that I want to stay up an extra 5 minutes. But omg if I want to go to bed he doesn't care or just says okay and I have to wait for even over an hour at times. Then says what he does is more important than me and I'm just a house wife so I should just do my woman's job. I don't have any issues at all doing women's job and being a house wife at all. I actually enjoy that very much. Its just that he prioritizes himself a lot. \n\nHe does think of me first a lot too. But some things he can be extremely selfish in then turns it on my basically saying I'm a monster if I even try to do the same thing he does back to him. I am very happy still. My husband did pull me out of depression and I'm very happy all the time. But I just don't know what anything is anymore. Like reading this over I realize that its absolutely horrible and bad, but when experiencing them and seeing my husband I can't see him as bad. I love him. He helps me. \n\nI have a skin condition that makes it extremely painful to move my arm above the elbow. So he helps me get dressed, and showers me. I generally walk around naked all the time because he says why wear clothes in the house since my skin condition makes all my clothes smell like rotting flesh and also its painful when clothes rub against it. Another reason is its just easier so I don't have to ask for him to put on and off clothes every day. I can't find anyone else other than him and TY who would ever do anything like that. But Ty is my best friend and we are platonic now. I wonder if I should have chosen Ty. I've known he's had feelings for me since 6th grade but I don't know... He's always been like a sibling or best friend more than a partner to me despite us matching so perfectly. I have gotten feelings for him and are definitely attracted to him too, but always afraid of ruining our friendship. \n\nAnother issue is Ty and T hate each other. They have severe issues due to both knowing of each other's love for me. As obviously T loves me because he's my husband. But also they are sort of racist to each other. Ty is Japanese. T is Chinese. The two say insults about each other's countries. Like T always calls TY a \"lil fucking Jap\". and Ty always calls T a \"fucking commi\" (since china is Communist).  So often times I'm not even allowed to see Ty, but are allowed to talk to him in phone calls. Ty keeps ruining T's plans of keeping us separated by going to my college as I'm starting to continue studies. And we are in the same class, so it makes it physically impossible to not see each other. I really don't know anything or what to do anymore. T is a very hard worker and has a good work ethic and makes a lot of money so we have a roof over our head and don't run out of money. I can't go back to my family or tell them anything. I don't want to anyways. I do want T to do something to work on his temper. If that's fixed then nothing is an issue at all. I want to have a future with him. At least after a long talk T stopped being so obsessed with his mom and talks to her like an hour a day. Which is much better and manageable. I don't want him to stop talking to his mom, I just want him to make time for at least me or other things and after talking and explaining that he understood and has been good on that.", "subreddit": "abuse"}

I felt really ashamed, especially being a psych grad and helping women out of physically abusive relationships, that I couldn't see my own situation so clearly for so long. I wrote a letter expressing my feelings, how I felt undervalued and unloved because of his particular actions and poor, moody forms of \"communication\" ( stonewalling, criticism, backhanded jokes and compliments) and how he has chipped away at my own sense of self that I need his input before making any decision, even choosing what clothes to wear in the morning or how to do my makeup (I used to have a very distinct sense of style, more gothic and \"edgy\", but he would always say I looked homeless or like a try-hard so I stopped dressing the way I liked). He received the letter very poorly, saying I was attacking him and how could I do this after all he had done for me and how much he has to put up with. He spins it around so much that I typically end up crying and begging him to forgive me. Every time he's gone or I'm out I feel like I can think clearly again and try to build myself up to confront him again. \n\nTo be fair, he had done a lot for me. He cooks every night (I have/had a restrictive type eating disorder and cooking gives me massive anxiety). He does all the grocery shopping for this reason as well. He puts on the washing and does the dishes in the morning, while I do them in the evening. He works full time while I work casually and continue my studies. Without him taking on these tasks around the home and financially I would really struggle to complete my studies and do well. \n\nBut he tells me that I'm lazy, that I'm too comfortable and I have it too good with him, that I sit back and let him do everything for me and I need to nagged to do anything. And I just don't think that's true, I think I contribute equally with cleaning and looking after pets, taking rubbish out, but he says it with such conviction and pain, like I really am using him. He says he can't help his angry outbursts because he feels so used and taken advantage of, then I feel like a lazy sack of shit because he clearly does hurt from it. He says the clothes and hair and makeup bagging is for my own good, because I can't dress or present myself the way I used to if I want to be taken seriously in my field.\n\nI guess I'm just left confused.

Then told me he feels under appreciated and maybe I should go stay at my parents.

I'd just block. \n\nI've been getting phone calls from restricted numbers and when I pick up the phone no one is there. \n\nAnd today he messaged me through a Facebook messenger app game we used to play a long time ago.

I know he'll always resort back to the manipulation and the gaslighting. It's like clockwork. So I know the begging was the most genuine part of him. He only wants me back because he needs to have someone to do those things to. And the most ingenuine part of it all was that he'll change. Just this one more chance he says. Funny, because if I let him in my life he wouldn't even be capable of admitting to all the wrong things he's done to me. Now all of a sudden that he's starting to realize that I am serious about being broken up he knows he messed up? But it's worse, because he doesn't actually mean it. \n\nHe basically said he was going to come drive to me. I live 3 hours away from him now. And he knows where I live. I really really really don't want him to show up at my place. And if he does, what do I do? \n\nIn the messenger app I made it clear to him that I wanted him to stop reaching out.

I screenshot them and send them to my friends for a good laugh at his absolute InSaNiTy. My friends and I have literally adopted his insults and use them to make fun of each other because we find him just that laughable at this point. Almost all of my friends are people who have known me over 20 years. In those 20+ years of friendship, I would like to think, these few people who have stood the test of time from middle and high school, who have seen me through some highs and lows, would see through a facade and know if I was a shitty person at the core of my being. They have assured me, it simply is not the case.\n\nWell this morning's tirade was some shenanigans about him knocking his new girlfriend up. I laughed until I just sounded like whistling tea kettle and immediately had to offer my congratulations to his mom and SIL. His SIL was confused af but she told me she still loved me, she was sorry he was so awful to me and she was always there for me. His mom never replied but I doubt I will hear from her. Definitely not my finest moment, but the snark took over and I could not help myself. The thought of a dude, who at 36, had never even had his own place until me, having a 5th kid, was a fucking joke to me. I didn't even care if it was true or not. It was sad either way.\n\nBut I digress... My biggest accomplishment today was spending time researching text blocking apps. After the texts I woke up to, I was like, \"Listen here Ms. Blunted, tomorrow is Sunday and that is the Lord's day. You don't need to be getting that mess on God's day.\" (Read: NOT TODAY SATAN.) So, his texts are now lost in the technological abyss never to be seen by the light of this Super AMOLED display. I also downloaded a call protection app so his calls are legit blocked and he can't leave me anymore voicemails either. I went right back to no contact without even shedding a tear this time around. And I didn't have to lose my kickass new phone number I got the last time I went no contact with him. All of this had me walking on cloud 9 today. I was legit giddy at work. I think it was just the relief to have removed his negative presence from my life once again. I feel lighter and much more at ease again.\n\nSadly though, the last few days of tirades have made me realize that our entire relationship was built on his lies. It was never real. He didn't ever love me. I don't know if he is capable of love. Someone who had even the slightest modicum of love for someone would never treat that person how this man has treated me. I feel like I made a huge step forward today in going back to no contact and in my realization that things with him just weren't real.", "subreddit": "NarcissisticAbuse"}

Immediately after my mother and seven years older sister began being hostile and agresssive with me. They made me feel guilty for my dads death and that I didn\u2019t deserve to get into a good university which was my way out, making my sister jealous. \n- They began forcing me to sleep with my mother and one night she put her hand on my stomach and I felt uncomfortable and pushed her hand away and then she placed her hand back on me. The atmosphere was strange and it was like she was going to have sex with me and I felt paralysed. Nothing happened. \n- They began forcing me to drink alcohol on many occasions against my consent. \n- They ultimately forced me to work in a bar serving drunks all summer as some punishment, against my consent. They were relentless and aggressive in making this happen. My sisters friend is a bar manager and my sister would come in to work to ensure I had not left. \n- I got into a good uni so I thought this would end, but it continued and continued and now I just want your help or guidance. \n- My mother didn\u2019t support me getting help from my uni in the first semester refusing proof of my dads death so they could help me.\n- My mother did not support me living in a flat with friends and instead isolating me by putting me in a one-bed flat that is free to live in as it was purchased with my dads apartment money from his death. \n- Lonely in the flat, I bought a rope for attention to wake my mother up and have heart-to-heart and feel compassion. She did the opposite and forced me to go the GP and forced her way into the meeting against my consent, and forced the NHS to provide a service called IHTT which administers drugs to people at home, despite the GP being very surprised at IHTT being offered and reassuring my mother  that I am fine and not to interfere I was 20 at the time.\nThis is where my story gets worse and I became a victim of institutionalism of psychiatry and my mother in collusion with the doctor forced drugs on my against my consent for a year, drugging me out of university for a year and traumatising me with myofaschial pain. She beat me, shouted at me and made feel guilty for my dads death. I bought her \u00a3500 worth of Christmas presents under the subordination I was in and to make her stop.

I posted this on r/depression last night, only just discovered this group existed today. I wanted to share this with you all here as well.\r\n\r\nI'm a 29 year old male that was physically, sexually and emotionally abused by my ex girlfriend 5 years ago.\r\n\r\nIf you wish to read the following story below do so with caution due to triggers. TL;DR I was wondering if anyone can talk to me about how to manage this whole ordeal. Has anyone here managed to survive their abuser and live a functional life? I have been on and off different types of medication, therapy (cognitive behaviourial and talk).  I've tried everything in my power to avoid and distance myself from the past but its always there festering in my mind. I cannot function, I'm unemployed, even trying to look for a job makes me feel physically sick. The simplest of things remind me of her and the abuse. Doctors have diagnosed me with PTSD, depression and anxiety. \r\n\r\nBackground: Fresh out of university in 2012, naive as ever. I met a girl online through friends in early 2013. She lives a different country (I won't mention which one). We hit it off immediately, it was your typical online romance, you have everything in common with each other, everything felt and seemed right to me. We talked for several months getting to know each other then she invited me to visit her. So I did just that, worked hard, saved money and visited her for 2 weeks in September 2013. Everything went supremely well, we were inseparable. She wanted me to move there someday so we could start a life together, to do that I had an idea to study one of those EFL courses so I could teach English and settle there. Met her again in January 2014 and April 2014. Everything was normal, no issues she was the ordinary sweet girl you'd hope to expect when you love someone. From that point I was sure and ready to make the move, I completed the EFL course by that point so I applied for teaching jobs and was accepted for one. Her parents were kind enough to allow me to live with them for the first few months until I could save up for a place of my own. Moving day happened in early October 2014 with my first day of teaching starting soon after, right off the bat there were issues with the school in regards to visa documentation. Left the school after the first week and found another in late November 2014. During the unemployed phase I was giving all of my time and energy to please her, our love life was optimal. But cracks were beginning to show, she began sleeping in late, refusing to attend university she only recently started, getting irritable with minor issues. She kept obsessing about getting married and having children. Something I agreed with but in due time, I still needed to get my life together, learn the native language in more detail, understand their culture and traditions, importantly satisfy her parents by showing I can provide for their daughter.\r\n\r\nWhat happened (trigger warning): 1st December 2014 beginning my first week of teaching after a weeks trial. Normally I would wake up and see my ex still sleeping next to me but she wasn't there. I thought maybe she went to university early. I went to open the bedroom door and it was locked from the outside. I knocked and shouted out, no answer, her parents had gone out and assumed the worst that she was as well. Proceeded to shout and bang harder at the door, no response. Looked for my phone and laptop, it was missing from the room. Heard a shuffling outside of the room, looked through the keyhole and my ex was sat on a chair facing the door. She had a strange smirk on her face, cigarette in her hand and my phone in the other. \r\n\r\nI said \"What are you doing? Let me out please, I have no time for games as this day is crucial.\"\r\n\r\nShe said \"No. Have sex with me.\" \r\n\r\nMe: \"Can we do that tonight? I really need to get ready. \r\n\r\nHer: \"No.\" Walks off. \r\n\r\nI start yelling at her, demanding her to let me out, banging at the door but by this point she had already disappeared. 10 minutes passed, time was running short to get to work. I caved in. Yelled for her to come back. She was there in an instant, opened the door and pushed me to the bed. After she got what she wanted the grin on her face disappeared returning to her innocent smile. \"Have a nice day sweet heart.\"\r\n\r\nManaged to get to work on time. A normal day, came home and she was acting as if nothing happened that very morning. Her parents were home. I tried talking to her about it, she kept ignoring me, changing the subject saying she had no idea what I was talking about. \r\n\r\nDay two, woke up and again she wasn't there. It was a repeat of yesterday. Door was locked, phone and laptop missing. She was waiting again outside the room. I gave her what she wanted. This time being late for work, to the disdain of the school. When evening came I told her not to do it again she denied and ignored me. I thought it was a game of hers at the start but the next day changed everything.\r\n\r\nDay three. She did it again. Waiting there with that grin on her face from previous days. I tried negotiating with her saying it was going to affect my job if I continued being late. I refused to give her what she wanted and she disappeared. Banging at the door and yelling out to her. Tried opening the window but there was a mosquito guard bolted onto it. I couldn't get out of the room. Tried pushing the door open and unlocking it with whatever I could find in the room. No luck. So desperate for the toilet at this point I resorted to pissing in a bin. I was in the room for 3 hours, banging at the door. Starting to feel like a prison at this point. I heard the front door to the apartment open. It was her, she had gone off to university. She was standing at the door with the grin on her face she had previously. \"I phoned your school today, told them you are sick.\" I argued telling her this was disgusting behaviour what if there was a disaster and I couldn't get out? No response. She opened the door, I tried barging past her while at the same time threatening to tell her parents, she punched me in the nuts, pushed me back into the room and threatened me. I will never forget this line.. \"IF YOU TELL ANYONE ABOUT THIS I WILL MAKE UP A STORY SAYING THAT YOU RAPED ME. YOU WILL END UP IN PRISON OR MY DAD WILL KILL YOU FIRST. YOUR CHOICE.\"\r\n\r\nBacked into a corner of her room she slapped, kicked me and again demanded me for sex. Forcing herself upon me. \r\n\r\nNumbness ensued that day. I was a hostage in love with my captor. She controlled everything I did, watched my every move and I was relying on her to survive, keeping her parents impressed so I can keep a roof over my head. Too scared to reach out to anyone I kept silent, gave her what she wanted when she demanded it. I regret not defending myself against her. \r\n\r\nThis continued for 3 weeks. Every morning I would be late for school, which damaged my prospects with the school. I even I woke up earlier to try and avoid her but she would hear and discover my every move and blackmail me into submission. Everyday I would wish for her parents to be at home so she would be unable to do anything abusive to me. Those days were salvation. I would at stay in the school for as long as possible to avoid her but she would turn up to check on me almost daily. Whenever I talked to friends or family online she would be there watching over my shoulder.  \r\n\r\n25th December 2014 was a day off from teaching. Christmas day is supposed to be the happiest time with family and the ones you love. She spent the majority of the day in bed, meanwhile her parents were out meeting some family friends for some party. I had the opportunity to talk to my parents on skype, I saw my whole family sat there eating a glorious meal my mother and grandmother prepare each year. They all told me how much they missed me and wished me a Merry Christmas. From there I came to the realisation that I needed to get the hell out of there. I broke down and admitted to them that things were not working out here. I never told them exactly why but they told to come home. I hid in the bathroom, booked my flight for the 27th December 2014.\r\n\r\nAs I completed the purchase I heard her running down the corridor towards the bathroom, she unlocked the door from the outside, snatched my phone then isolated herself in her room. 20 minutes later she came out, threw the phone at me and walked off. I was lucky enough to delete my emails and archive my flight confirmation. \r\n\r\nAn hour later she returned, she had been drinking and smoking a lot. Approached me and began pushing me to have sex once more, after coming to the realisation that I needed to get out I kept refusing, her blackmail escalated into violence. She pushed, kicked, scratched, punched me wherever she could reach, avoiding her I tried making my way to the front door of the apartment but it was locked, she kept the key hidden. I spent the next few hours avoiding her as much as I could, trying to isolate myself in a room but she had taken all of the keys and it was impossible to barricade in time. Hours passed and by night time I had no clothes left, covered in scratches, exhausted. She had me cornered beating me while I was curled in a ball. She kept saying \"Have sex with me, stop resisting, make it easier on yourself.\" I kept shouting No doing all I could to hold on. \r\n\r\nAfter some time after got what she wanted, I lay there on the floor from exhaustion. I begged for her mercy while she sat on me, forcing herself upon me. I won't go into anymore detail on this.\r\n \r\nI couldn't remember the 26th December. The entire day was numb and surreal, I had been raped, humiliated, exposed and destroyed. I lay in bed for the entire day counting down the hours until I could escape. She spent the entire day in bed as well, with a huge hangover, this was lucky as I was so close to lashing out at her or committing suicide at this point. I was at wits end. What was also sick and twisted was the fact that I was still in love with her. There was a strange feeling, a force in my mind telling me to stay telling me that we could work it out between us. Love really makes you blind in these situation, I'm glad of one thing and that was escaping her physical grasp.\r\n\r\nI prepared a small bag of belongings which I stashed in the airing cupboard the night before. It was early morning on the 27th December, I sneaked out of the apartment with all the possessions I could carry. Left everything else behind, didn't even tell the school that I was leaving.\r\n\r\nI made it to the airport vigilantly looking over my shoulder in case she followed me. I only felt partially safe as I landed back on home soil. My parents were there to greet me at the airport and took me home. There was a feeling of relief, I never said anything to them apart from \"We argued a lot.\" (Up until 5 years later I have told my mother of what really happened just recently.)\r\n\r\nChecking my social media that evening I had over 100 messages and missed calls from her asking where I was, I replied saying I left the country. Told her how disgusted I was by what she did to me. She denied it all using her sweet words to try and convince me. Stockholm Syndrome is real because she knew everything about me, knew how to tune into my emotions and tap out what she wanted to hear, I was still saying I loved her and wanted to be with her. I spent 3 months in bed trying to figure this all out in my head, I would argue against her, hating her in the daytime by the end of the day falling in love with her once more.\r\n\r\nBy April 2015 she claimed she was pregnant with my child and that she had an abortion. To my knowledge her country did not allow abortions, there was no evidence of a first scan or documentation whatsoever. I asked her closest friends, they all said they didn't know.\r\n\r\nI found out also by this point that she was also dating other men. This made me click and realise she wasn't worth it, I ended up deleting her from every social media platform along with her number. This happened in June 2015.\n\nI may write up more later.

A real place where there are adults who won\u2019t throw knives or bricks at me. A place where I could eat at a table. My high school even had showers in the bathrooms where I could be clean. \nThe abuse had such a horrible impact on my brother. He completely started mimicking my mother\u2019s violence and I was sent to school with more bruises. I was considering suicide as a viable option at 12. My brother used to chase me around the house with knives. Now that I\u2019m 18 the beatings don\u2019t happen that often anymore but every once in a while it does happen. And the fear of being killed is once again real. That I could just be stabbed right now. I think about how I would bleed out and just die. To be surrounded by my own family and to die truly alone. Unfortunately I can\u2019t cut ties with my family yet. I still live with them but I opened a second bank account dedicated to earning enough money so I can be prepared when i move out and restart my life. \n\nWhen I was 16 I was diagnosed as bipolar. Please don\u2019t worry, I have support, I\u2019m seeing a psychologist as well as my psychiatrist and I am taking my medication. everyday I go to work, come home and every night as I go to sleep I say to myself. You are ok, You are a survivor. And someday you will be free. That\u2019s all I have to hold on to now but for right now it\u2019s enough.\n\nEdit: was ranting and forgot to mention that my parents are in extreme debt and my dad has a drug addiction. \nSo yeah Thankyou for reading. I guess I just needed to vent.", "subreddit": "abuse"}

That was my mistake. That and believing we could have a professional relationship. We talked casually at first, with him occasionally hinting at \"us\" while I pretended not to notice. I'm just going to put the details here before I delete the messages and while the memory is fresh so I can look back at this and confirm that I'm not crazy.\n\n1. He's one of the most ornery people I know. Always has to find faults in everything. Has had at least one heated argument with every single person at the office. Jokingly call him a moody old man? \"You're the only one who's ever called me moody. I'm really laid back but you just can't see that.\"\n2. I said \"I just wanted to have a casual conversation but you keep bringing up our relationship.\" he replied \"You were the one who brought it up! You always do that. So tiresome.\"\n3. He blamed me for the break-up. \"You never do what I want you to do. Never make any effort to satisfy me.\" This coming from the man who always blames me for being selfish.\n4. He said \"You were constantly texting me! When I go quiet, I expect you to do the same.\" I said \"When I need space, you never give it to me. Always calling me begging for attention when I'm obviously busy. Double standard much?\" His reply? \"I'm allowed to do that. I'm the man. You're supposed to follow my lead.\"\n5. He *demanded* I send him the location to my new flat. When I said \"I don't want to have to call the cops this late in the evening. Just let it go.\" he pretended he was joking. He was obviously also joking when he threatened to find out where I lived and make me \"regret playing these games\". \n6. Of course he tried to play the victim again. \"You never try to understand me even though I know you inside and out. You're so blind to who I am and what I need.\" When in reality some of the saddest parts of the relationship were when he'd distance himself from me for no reason and totally ghost me as I tried to understand what was happening and what he was feeling. He would never ever share anything with me. I'd ask each time. I wanted to know. I cared about him and wanted to get close to him. He just wouldn't let me.\n7. When I DESTROYED that cuck with facts and logic, he claimed he was busy and stopped texting me. When I called him out on his habit of starting a confrontation and then running away,  he came back to call me stupid. The truth in what I was saying hurt his little ego so much that he also had to call me a schizo.\n8. I told him to delete my number. Exactly as he did when I broke up with him, he accused me of \"being obsessed\" and \"coming on too strong\". Motherfucker you're the one texting me from an unknown number saying you've missed me. You're the one asking if I found someone else and then getting mad when you couldn't get an answer.\n\nWriting this down made everything clearer. His ego got hurt when I broke up with him and this was his attempt at a payback. I feel like a damn fool. Of course I blocked him now but I feel like I stooped to his level. His gaslighting efforts were effective. Everything he claimed couldn't be further from the truth but I still felt like maybe he was right. He knows where to hit to make the most damage. I can see it's impossible to get along with him unless you're willing to overlook all of his faults which make up the majority of his personality. The good people of this sub: I'll take all the help I can get. Tell me I'm not crazy. Share stories from when the narcs in your lives made you believe you were crazy. Even a simple \"Me too.\" would do so much. I'd like to not feel this alone right now.\n\nTL;DR\n\nCouldn't resist a hoover. He played all of the ol' narcissistic tricks on me.

I've been abused a lot from my teen years forward; I've been raped multiple times, I've had the lives of my friends and family threatened if I didn't comply, I've been stalked, I've been drugged,I've gone home black and blue and there are certain parts of my body that have been so damaged I no longer feel sensation in them. I didn't grow up in a very supportive family, my parents weren't abusive but very image based. We had to look like the perfect family and because of that they were very strict with me and kept me from being able to develop a healthy social life. Because of that I was desperate for attention and fell into the abuse cycles above. I blame my parents  for that honestly and we are healing but slowly. They don't really understand me but I can't talk to them about these things because I am still angry with them and can't speak constructively about it. There is one thing I think I can talk to them about.\n\nMAIN POINT: I was sexually abused as a child (I think), I have no memories other than a lot of red flags. I mean  A LOT of red flags and they all point to a specific person that I happen to be terrified of, but I don't know why I'm so afraid of them. I really want to open up to my parents (I'm an adult now) and find out if they have any knowledge of this or if looking back they notice red flags. I also just want them to understand why I am the way I am. I don't blame them for this like I do the other things.

I look back and I start thinking about all the times that I should have had more empathy, I should have been more caring and understanding and how much my partner sacrificed for me. Then since my wife and I are not talking she talks to my parents and says some pretty nasty things. For instance I was the victim of a violent crime and was beaten with a baseball bat and suffered a traumatic brain injury and during that time we elected my parents as guardians of our children. My wife and I had separated for a brief time and we got back together. She told parents that the only reason she got back with me was she thought that way she could get the kids back. That hurt a lot to hear that.  She would pick fights and then call the police, they would come out and tell her that they can\u2019t just make someone leave when there has been no violence. She did this three nights in a row. When they wouldn\u2019t grant her an EPO she went and filed a temporary restraining order with the court with a move out order. I was forced to move out and she wouldn\u2019t let me have any of my belongings. I asked for a jacket and she said she would put it outside and when I went and grabbed it she called the police and I got arrested for being within 100yrds of her. When I went to the hearing on the temporary restraining order the judge denied it and dropped it and ordered her to give me one of our vehicles and to give me my personal property. She has yet to do so. She has stated I can only have what I had before we got married which through the years has dwindled down to mementos, pictures, etc. I have an entire shop of tools and other things. She told my parents I\u2019m not getting anything. I\u2019ve been forced to move into a Veterans Transitional Housing for homeless and at risk of becoming homeless veterans. Our relationship has been rocky and drugs have been the catalyst for almost all, if not all our problems.  I\u2019ve stopped the drugs she is still using and very vicious and mean. I keep thinking about the horrible things I\u2019ve said and done and it makes me feel horrible. I want to blame the drugs but I know I still said some horrible things drugs or no drugs. I also realize that just because she hurt me doesn\u2019t make it right to hurt her. \n\nI\u2019ve read post after post and I see so much of what has happened in our relationship happen in other peoples relationships. I\u2019ve seen myself in some of the posts and it scares me. Then I see her in the posts as well. I want to blame it all on the drugs because we were so happy when we were clean and sober at least I thought. I feel like a lot of things were just a facade. I feel like she can\u2019t be a narc because she always seemed so concerned about others and extremely fixated on us. Then I think about the love bombing and how she was either all in for us or she is my enemy. In her mind your either on her side or your against her.

I compiled some excerpts from an online forum. All of these are from diagnosed ASPD or NPD.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;I went through 25 years of life almost entirely convinced that I was the good guy, no matter my actions, often being completely obtuse to how my actions and dispositions affected others. As far as I was concerned, my \u2018true\u2019 intentions were always good. I truly grew up trying my best to see the good in everyone, probably because I had hidden away how little I actually thought of myself.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Also, a very odd thing about NPD is that somehow, the disordered mind is capable of also righting any wrongs like that and sometimes overwriting history/facts (either temporarily for convenience or permanently basically gaslighting one\u2019s own Self) to set the record of intentions always to the side of the narcissist. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;.. I don't go out of my way to have good intentions, but I do assume that I've not caused any harm, mainly because I under-estimate how my behaviour has affected people combined with a refusal to accept responsibility for it.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;I'll assume that people like me and that if they say that a problem isn't a problem I'll assume it's all over with and everything's back to normal.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;It's the grandiosity and narcissism. I know that I do it; sitting here and thinking about it, I know it happens, as there's too much evidence to deny it. But, I still don't really believe it. I still have the belief that people have over-reacted and I've been judged too harshly.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Having someone in hospital because you've driven them to attempt suicide, I still think, \"It's their choice, they didn't have to stay,\" etc.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Even as I write this, I still can't see it as my fault. Well it's not; we all choose.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;I believe I usually have good intentions that are thwarted by my defective brain, anxiety, narcissism, etc., although sometimes my intentions are to impress others at their expense. For instance, I sometimes tell people I'm going on a vacation for 10 days and talk about the details of the trip. I get angry if they don't appear impressed. And I know (or assume) it may make them feel jealous, insecure, or feel bad, but I do it anyway.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;So my intentions are mostly good, but colored by narcissism and insecurity. And sometimes if I'm retaliating against someone, my intentions are to right a perceived wrong and put myself back into the superior position. The intention isn't bad, per se; it's not sadistic just for the sake of sadism, although it can have the same effect. But mostly it is due to insecurity and the need to be the superior one.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;.. I take some responsibility when I hurt someone, but I always try to find a way to blame them for some part of it, because responsibility is painful and exposes my imperfection and weakness. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;In full honesty, I'm apparently so delusional and narcissistic that your \"even if they don't see you as the most attractive person they've ever encountered\" triggered the familiar panic and narcissistic rage in me at my false or at least desperately wished-for reality being questioned, even of course in your case inadvertently/unintentionally and even though I know intellectually that I'm not the most attractive person in the world.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;For example, I'll think, \"I'm gorgeous,\" to which I'll cringe and think \"I can't think that,\" and I have to think \"I'm not gorgeous\" to neutralize the inevitable disappointment of walking around thinking that and having it not be confirmed by the world.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt; I hate rejection with a passion; it makes me question my worthiness, my attractiveness (above all), my personality, etc. It makes me hate myself and hate the person who rejected me and put me in the inferior position.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;..I think anger at rejection is probably one of the most normal responses. Ignore correct societal behaviour and look at how all animals behave. Their behaviour is based on finding a mate, conflict with a rival, anger, violence and then winning or losing. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;When I'm rejected, the next few days are anxiety-, shame-, and anger-filled, and I can barely function. I ######6 hate this.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;I'd been fired from a job where I was the manager of a department. I used to have someone who'd do most of my work for me and I'd just do the front-man job of talking to people, which I have an uncanny talent for. When that person left, my incompetence in the role became quickly obvious.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;I'd 'work at home' and spend all day taking drugs and playing computer games. I sacked a contracting company in favour of a company owned by a friend of mine, because he owned a villa in France I could use whenever I wanted.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;I'd make blind decisions which affected people and switched them back when it suited me.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Years later i went to a reunion for that company and the same friend came to me and said he was surprised I'd turned up. Then he pissed himself laughing when it was clear that I had no idea why that would be.   \n&gt;  \n&gt;I sometimes speak to people I've known as if nothing's wrong, when I have wronged them but have had no idea that it upset them. I forget things that I caused that were devastating to them, which makes them feel ignored, I guess.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;Do you not even like playing with people and making fun of them?  \n&gt;  \n&gt;This is why I really enjoy them but then I've also had to learn to run fast or at least duck.", "subreddit": "NarcissisticAbuse"}

I was terrified but I did it. Of course scary and awful fight ensued. Then he said he\u2019d try and wanted \u201cus\u201d to try. Thought it was both of us tearing down the relationship..... but he at least admitted to some of his stuff though which I could tell was hard for him.\n\nIn September after another just awful vile terrifying infuriating fight when I was literally trying to make things better, I went and got my stuff from his place. After refusing therapy forever he finally now said he\u2019d do it. But then I lost my job so we couldn\u2019t afford it.\n\nThrough most of September and October he was obviously being more loving and sweet and actively trying not to act on his bad behaviors. Especially the temper and shouting. October he was relatively ok. I have been in a mind set where I\u2019m done and have been finding strength to leave for good. But when the person you\u2019re closest to in the world (for good or bad) is now being nice a lot of the time it makes it more difficult to say peace out forever. It also makes it difficult when I know he\u2019s going to lose his shit and it\u2019s going to be terrifying. I\u2019ve never in my life been scared to say end things with someone because of their reaction. I\u2019m terrified of what his will be and how it will psychologically affect me. He won\u2019t hit me. But he may as well when it\u2019s that bad verbally and he\u2019s screaming. I\u2019d rather be hit than what he does. His temper is something I cannot physically and emotionally endure when it\u2019s at its worst.\n\nSo I\u2019ve been in limbo. He\u2019s been actively trying to make it work but I haven\u2019t been seeing him that often which makes it easier for us to not fight. We almost had a really bad one, I could feel it coming the other night after a movie. I braced myself to physiologically react to him screaming, or getting into it. Impressively enough he really did stop himself. I was pretty shocked. And relieved. But I saw it was brewing... and we HAVE had some arguments.\n\nAnyway getting to my point to how I\u2019m now the asshole? I feel resentful, I feel mad, I feel pushed away. I haven\u2019t officially said \u201cI\u2019m done with this relationship and you\u201d out of fear and selfish reasons because I bonded to him right after my dad passed. He\u2019ll always have that advantage over others honestly. He was my person for my grieving the hardest thing I\u2019ve ever grieved. I have an emotional attachment. But I\u2019m not in love anymore. And I honestly don\u2019t think he\u2019s in love with me? He thinks he is or he wants to be? I really don\u2019t think he is.\n\nOur sex life has never been satisfying. Because he\u2019s a narcissist he doesn\u2019t care about my needs. He\u2019s the only guy in my entire life that hasn\u2019t been obsessed with satisfying me no matter what. They\u2019ve always made it a priority or automatically part of the experience. Except for those unfortunate early 20\u2019s one night stand mistakes where you realize what it\u2019s like to be used. Even some of those cared more. Any guy who\u2019s really loved me and he so claims has all used the phrase \u201cthis isn\u2019t over until you come\u201d so in the entire year and odd months we\u2019ve been together I think I\u2019ve O\u2019d like 5 times? \ud83e\udd14 4? Because he never asks if I did. I can\u2019t from just sex alone. I told other guys that as well and it\u2019s never stopped them from making it happen. And he\u2019s not very good at making me O in other ways when he does do it because I don\u2019t think hes done it much in his life and also never done it with me enough to learn what works. He *knows* I can\u2019t from sex alone. He typically just stops once he\u2019s satisfied or he\u2019ll go some more for fun (not as much anymore) but I always have to basically ASK for him to do it and that really got old so I stopped. And our entire sex life became so underwhelming and made me angry. I even told him this. But of course it didn\u2019t matter. It didn\u2019t change anything. \n\nHere\u2019s where I\u2019m now the asshole. And I need to know if I should feel as guilty as I do. No, we never really see each other as often. I haven\u2019t slept over there and vice versa in months. I told him we needed therapy and to hit refresh if we had any chance at all. Yeah, he\u2019s been trying but at the same time he\u2019s been distant emotionally. We never really have sex and that was one of my biggest issues and the other night as usual I was the one to initiate. And I did this because I wanted to feel intimacy, he was being sweet, and I wanted to see if we could connect. As usual he rejected me. I didn\u2019t fight with him, I didn\u2019t flip out. He knows this is a problem especially for me and my past but I just sort of said \u201cI\u2019m gonna go\u201d feeling depleted and hurt and embarrassed as usual. He said he was sorry, he tried hugging me a million times and I pushed him off me gently and said I\u2019m gonna go I just wanna go. He said please don\u2019t be mad and I said I can feel however I want. I could tell he was trying not to get angry and he didn\u2019t. He let me go.\n\nI\u2019ve been ignoring his millions of texts. I blocked him on my phone.\n\nCut to last night I went and met up with this guy I know from grief group. We are just friends. We barely talk. Or text.

I do enjoy time with him.\n\nIt feels like both cheating and not cheating. My \u201crelationship\u201d has been rocky as hell forever now. I\u2019ve been unhappy and unsatisfied forever now. I\u2019ve dealt with abuse forever now. And now, when he\u2019s been consistently nicer, however more emotionally distant and still not as sexual, I went and made out with someone. I never do this. I don\u2019t do stuff like this. I feel incredibly guilty.\n\nShould I?? My mom says after everything he\u2019s put me through and the last time I saw him I left his apartment because he once again rejected me when we never have sex to begin with that I shouldn\u2019t feel guilty. We aren\u2019t engaged or married. I don\u2019t even know where I stand.\n\nHowever to save his own ass he\u2019s never told me he\u2019s thought about breaking up except once. When we talked in August finally. That upset me. He said he did question us around the time I was saying I felt a shift from him and he denied it. That was last January. But all the messages he\u2019s been sending me since I left are about how he wants to buy a house and have kids with me and get married. That I\u2019m the one. Stuff he spewed at the beginning of our relationship then he back pedaled and denied doing that. (January-feb he was really different) Then spewed it when I got my stuff from his place. Is now spewing it after I left very mad and hurt the other night. So it makes me feel more guilty but he could also just be manipulating me.\n\nI don\u2019t plan on sleeping with other guys. I was tipsy and I kissed him and he kissed me back. It was short and most people could prob write off they did it but I\u2019m different. \n\nAm I now a horrible person? Has he turned me into that? I\u2019m so resentful and lonely and broken I\u2019m now being dishonest?", "subreddit": "NarcissisticAbuse"}

The next morning I flew my corporate office for the first of my week long work trips I do monthly since we moved cross country for SO\u2019s new job. That was a really sucky week.\n\nOf course, the next three months have continued to suck pretty hard too. He\u2019s dieting hard-core and exercising after work, getting in shape for my replacement - who is one of his direct reports. We also met at work.\n\nIt\u2019s amazing that after so many years (over a decade, really) of not being willing to get off the couch. or bathe regularly, he is spending a lot of time and energy on his appearance.\n\nI stopped being able to sleep about a month ago. I have a hard time  getting to sleep, and when I do sleep it\u2019s like a light doze where I\u2019m aware of my surroundings and the passage of time. Tonight I couldn\u2019t stop the tears so I just came downstairs and I\u2019m alternating between crying and listening to the frogs in the creek.\n\nThe Coronavirus could not come at a worse time. My company will go under because of it. I\u2019m trapped even longer with this horrible person who thinks he\u2019s getting away with cheating on me and the kids. And to top it off, SidePiece traveled internationally and most likely infected him, which will infect me and the kids simply due to proximity.\n\nMy heart continues to break from what I learned in December, and the lies he tells me daily. I want this to be over so very badly.\n\nORIGINAL:\nWorking on child\u2019s iPad, needed to access her email that SO had set up.. found all the email alerts from a dating website. I freaked out, tried to set up a fake profile to find his profile before I realized I could just go into the email, change the password and see what was going on.\n\nSo I did that. No picture. Said he was divorced, had partial custody. Listed a bunch of BS interests that didn\u2019t include \u2018laying on the couch for days\u2019. Poster 2 weeks before my birthday he barely phoned in.\n\nThe password change triggered a notice that he received, so he asked me about it. And I asked him about it. Which triggered a 3 hour conversation, highlights including:\n- he thought we were heading for a divorce \n- he never contacted anyone\n- he doesn\u2019t want to be alone\n- he just wanted to see \u2018what\u2019s out there\u2019\n- I\u2019m the one person in his life that doesn\u2019t sure\n- I\u2019m a saint\n- great mom\n- under appreciated \n- will get therapy to deal with traumatic childhood \n- wants couples counseling \n- will do anything to make it work\n- we\u2019ve had a dead bedroom for years\n\nBasically said everything I would have wanted to hear... 10 years ago.\n\nBut here\u2019s the thing, he\u2019s going on about how bad things where and how things are so much better now - nothing has changed!!!\n\nI really need support to stay strong in my resolve. This isn\u2019t repairable. I can\u2019t believe him and get sucked in again and get hurt, AGAIN.\n\nTLDR: found SO dating profile, got mad apologies, he wants to work it out.", "subreddit": "NarcissisticAbuse"}

It\u2019s infuriating.

But then when people react or stand up to him, all of a sudden they\u2019re the problem and the narcissist is the victim. \n\nSee how that works?

She is married and her husband has a girlfriend as well . Up until a month ago we lived together for about 11 months and everything seemed to be fine with obvious growing pains with 4 adults and 4 kids ( 3 my gf and hubby's and 1 his gfs )all under 1 roof . \n   My girlfriend has low self esteem is a pleaser and can be self deprecating when she feels less than . I thought this behavior was driven by a previous boyfriend before being married but I found out in the last few weeks how wrong I may have been .\n   About 2 months ago things seemed to flip upside down . Arguments started happening between my girlfriend and her hubby's girlfriend and sometimes even her hubby and of course I would somehow get dragged into these moments and always tried to stay out of the arguements but somehow drive more communication between the 4 of us and solve the issues at hand . \n     Unfortunately hubby and his gf started concentrating their frustrations to me and at one point threatened to kick me out and actually made me sign an eviction statement . We worked through that and they changed their minds after seeing what I actually did around the house and how I helped the kids , but towards the end of the month more arguments and fights were stirring between the hubby and his gf against my gf and eventually myself . This resulted in them making me leave the home for erasing the prior months calendar and staking the kids homework on the kitchen counter where I thought it went later saying I didnt care and should have asked what to do with the kids work . The calendar was a family calendar and it was a new month and i just wanted to start a new and hope the new month was smoother than the last . I then was accused of erasing the calender to be malicious and vindictive and I didnt own it so I shouldn't have touched it . Everyone used the calender and added monthly events so we knew what was going on each day so I told them it wasnt intentional and I just was done with that month but out the door I went and my gf was made to leave for the weekend as well .\n    On my gf returning home she sat down and talked to her hubby and gf and discussed what had happened and what they expected from her and they wanted to do nothing with me for a while . \n     Through all of this I suspected they wanted to get me out of the house and they succeeded ,my next suspicion would be they would want my gf to break up with me in which she did about 2 weeks ago or so the other 2 think but my gf and I have been communicating as much as possible under the radar .\n   So I share this to explain a little and to share about  and ask for advice . You see I now see and know my gfs hubby is a narc . amazing how clear it is now that I dont live there and through a friend how found this group and in the last 2 days I've read and researched and my gf has been manipulated , used , tortured menatally for years and the worst is their kids have as well . It is so crystal clear but I dont know if my gf will accept this epiphany because he has brainwashed her that everything is her fault and she screws up all the time , that shes dumb and doesnt know anything . To her credit she is a sweetheart and kind ,unselfish and would do anything to help someone if she could which I now know he takes advantage of her good nature and belittles her for being gullable while along he is the one using that to overshadow the fact that he is the asshole treating her like shit . \n     My question is how can I get her to see him for what he really is and to get her and the kids away from him before he does more damage to them ?", "subreddit": "NarcissisticAbuse"}

I feel like I have to get this out of my mind and I want some assistance. I don't know what comes next. I want to help her, I want help for us. I want to create a safe environment for her.\n\nFriday night was my company holiday party. Like almost anytime we have an event, my In-Laws who live across the street were going to keep our girls overnight. It was, for us, an ordinary event with grandparents my children loved.\n\nThe next morning, I walked still in my pajamas to gather up my babies and hear stories about the night before. These stories are usually about the quantity of candy and cartoons they consumed - generic spoiled grandparent stories.\n\nNothing out of the ordinary at this time.\n\nWe get home and I ask my oldest, who is five, if she'd like to help me wrap presents. She is over the moon to help, and proceeds to chatter with me while we sort and wrap gifts to put under the tree. She keeps yawning, so I ask her if she's tired.\n\n\"Yeah. Grandpa kept me up last night.\"\n\nI'm not on edge at this point. The guest room they stay in doubles as an office of sorts, and my father-in-law is an avid computer gamer. I ask her if he was playing games.\n\n\"No, he was laying down next to me. He wanted me to play with his toy. But it's not a toy you know, it's like ours but it's different. You know, like to go to the bathroom?\"\n\nMy heart stops at this point. My husband, who had been rocking in the recliner with our two year old on his lap stops rocking and asks her to clarify. I don't hear her answers, I'm already enraged and shaking but find enough courage to walk into the next room.\n\nI call my sister. I don't know what else to do, and in the moment I can't think. She thinks for me, helps me breathe and points me to the hospital. \n\nWe thank her for telling us and let her know she didn't do anything wrong but what he did was wrong. We scoop them up and get down to the closest ER. They admit us to a room and my two year old is picked up by my sister. The cops arrive and talk to all of us separately, they call in the specialists (the fact that they have specialist for this crushes me) and we are taken to a crisis center.\n\nThis is also the first time I get sick. I hear her tell the doctor her \"grandpa\" was trying to lick her down there.\n\nAt the crisis center, we are met by a Crisis Intervention Specialist, a nurse, a forensic specialist (? Her exact title escapes me) as well as the detective and Sergeant assigned to the case. At each point more details are discovered and the case is clear that my daughter was the victim of ongoing sexual abuse perpetrated by her \"grandfather\". The detective gives provides us with some specific incriminating information, including a hand movement she made.\n\nThis is the second time I get sick.\n\nMy husband agrees to do a staged call with the detective to get him to admit on record. He doesn't directly admit, but we have enough evidence at this point. A judge signs the warrant and he is arrested.\n\nI know we did the right thing. We believed her, we got her help.

He would emotionally neglect me and withhold love. He would gaslight me and tell me my feelings weren\u2019t valid or that he had never done or said the things that he had abusively done or said. He would yell and yell and berate me. If I ever tried to express my feelings, he would get defensive and angry so I learned to just bury everything I was feeling.

We\u2019ve been through this before, and I took him back, and it never got better for long.\n\nI can\u2019t help but think MAYBE someday we can start again.

I\u2019ve only discovered that there\u2019s a severely wounded child stuck inside of me, I have trust issues, social anxiety, constantly begging for validation, excessively empathetic, extremely loyal. I overcompensate in a lot of ways but still perceive my existence as minimal and feel incapable and don\u2019t think I can achieve anything. I don\u2019t trust men and I\u2019m terrified of strangers and interacting with them. I never had a problem with this until college and I hate it. It\u2019s not me. This is more of a subconscious thing, I don\u2019t tell myself that I\u2019m not capable of doing these things but it manifests itself in my life. I want to turn things around for myself so I\u2019ve been getting help (started on meds and I\u2019ve seen a couple therapists but I\u2019m still looking for the right fit) but the fact that my mom is still in my life and she tells me that our relationship is fucked because of me and I have shit twisted in my head has me question myself and it just drives me nuts. I hate her so fucking much I almost wish she\u2019d die. I despise her and she knows it and uses it against me. I desperately crave a parent figure that I can trust and love and know that they love me unconditionally and although I know she can\u2019t be that I still want to try. Anyways because I\u2019m financially dependent I have to talk to them which means constant conflict, continued abuse and invalidation. I\u2019m getting to a breaking point. I really want to finish college, so badly. I have $5000 in my savings account which is enough to like get by for a little if I quit school. I just don\u2019t want to do that but it\u2019s getting to an excruciating point and when it\u2019s bad it\u2019s really bad. I feel so fucking alone and my friends can only help so much. I need help. I don\u2019t know what to do. If anyone has been in this predicament and could give me some tips, pointers, or ideas I would be so fucking grateful. This is actually terrible and I\u2019m so ducking sad and angry and frustrated at the fact that this is my reality.\n\nBtw I am getting a therapist but I\u2019ve also had therapists my entire life and I\u2019ve done residential treatment in Utah for 8 months upon my parents sending me away so I know that therapy is helpful but I need some further advice.

It was a great relationship to start off with, he was my first boyfriend, first kiss, first time having sex. but then slowly after time I started to realize he was a good for nothing narcissist. Then much later into the relationship, and it was too late when I discovered something else about him.\n\nHe told me that for three years he had committed beastiality with his dog, his argument was \"she liked it\" and my response was \"oh god...... no....\", he still owned this dog, and he wanted her to be our family dog when we got married. But before I knew about this, he had a sex fetish where he wanted me to wear a tail and ears sometimes. Now I was incredibly uncomfortable with this and I told him that, but I did it a few times for the sake of him because he told me that I needed to be open to doing things sexually.  And he insisted on calling me puppy as a nickname, and especially during sex. No matter how many times I told him I didnt like it. And he continued to do this stuff even after he told me everything \n\nI'm a person who believes that if someone is truly sorry for something and that they want to repent and want to do better, than I believe that they deserve a second chance. I gave him so many chances to change. He fucked up everyone of them. Finally the last chance I gave him I sat him down and told him how much he meant to me and how much I loved him, and I told him to pick me or his dog. All I wanted him to do was to find a loving home for the dog he sexually abused for years. I wanted her out of his grasp. I wanted him to grow as a person... he chose to keep his dog over me, he said the thought of her with someone else made him sick... he told me he didnt do anything with her while we were together, but I find that hard to believe.. but I see now that I was ignorant and blinded by love.. please dont question my morality, no one knew about this situation and all I had was the internet to go to for advice, and the internet told me that if I truly loved him I'd stay with him..... \n\nAfter he told me everything I would stay up till 5am googling ways to forget things, googling if I should still love him and why I still loved him. \n\nThere is so much more that he has said that were red flags, that I just wasnt able to see at the time. I was blinded by how much I loved him, I just didnt want it to be true, I wanted to feel whole and normal again. \n\nThis has messed me up so bad, when he told me everything, I dont think it quite processed how bad it was, like i knew what he was saying, but the dots didnt connect, then finally one day things started to click more and more... and they havent stopped clicking to this day...\n\nI feel so dirty, Gross, stupid, and ashamed in myself. I cry all of the time and there's not much I can do to feel better. I just want to forget about him. But that's so hard because for a year I devoted all of my time to him. He wanted me to get away from my family to be with him for 13 hours a day everyday of the week. \nI am so ashamed of myself, I just would rather die at this point. He wasnt a good person. And I know I deserved better, he even told me that. I'm the one who broke up with him. I've gone to therapy but it's really hard to find someone who has reached something like this. \n\nBut I just feel so dirty and broken, and I dont know what to do...

I'm sure you all know the blame game, the name calling, projecting and other things narcissists do to get back at people. At first I was trying to defend myself but quickly realized/remembered there was no way I could make him understand me. So I just stopped talking and let him go on with his accusations. One thing really stuck out to me: All my faults according to him can be summed up to me being a complete person with her own life, obligations, boundaries and desires. He thinks he's the best I could do and to get him back, all I have to do is: Forget my own worth as a human being, idealize him and overlook all his flaws, spend all my energy on trying to satisfy his every desire. Oh and I also need to apologise, nay, beg for forgiveness for all the things I did wrong. Well I'm sorry I was only your girlfriend and not your indentured servant. You sad, insecure little man.\n\nPs: I did end up calling him an insecure little man to his face and it felt SO GREAT.

They also missed a lot of work days cause they didn\u2019t fell good or other reasons. I would go to work everyday barely ask for time off and always do what I am told. I never said anything about it because he would always give us gifts and it seemed like he had a temper but still good heart but also a little afraid to say anything. \nLast Thursday I called in because I couldn\u2019t sleep after personal problems and felt the need to stay home and not drive while sleep deprived as work was 40 min away. He got mad saying that I couldn\u2019t do this to him and that there was a lot of work to do, when I know for a fact that Thursday\u2019s are our slowest days and there would be no problem.

Going through a divorce and have been separated for 7 months now.\n\nI (32m) and she (29F) spent the weekend together. \n\nTwo weeks ago (which now seems like such a blur) she wrote me saying she wants to work things out. She was tired of our 3yr having to go back and fourth between two places and she realized I\u2019m a great guy and always had everyone\u2019s best interest at heart. I wrote her a letter 2 months into our separation explaining where I fucked up in our relationship and was taking accountability for my actions. She said she has been reading it over and over. So last week we did lunch twice, which went well. We communicated and enjoyed our time together and she seemed to want to really open up to me.\n\nMy life is going well (recently rented a house, have a car that I fixed up myself, and always have a smile on my face and keep my cool around her). Her life however, is fucked. She spends her nights drinking and being lonely...except when she was with a guy \u201cfriend\u201d, who she thought would be ok to bring around our son even though they aren\u2019t dating or plan to date.\n\nSo this weekend we decided to spend time together and see how it went. The first night we went to the bar and had a great time. We were laughing, talking about uncomfortable things and saying that we would be happier together. Tons of cute texts and I miss you texts and her admitting she was the problem. I stayed the night with her and we had awful, awful sex. No passion, no touching me, no kissing and weren\u2019t weren\u2019t that drunk.\n\nThe next night threw up such a red flag. She started pulling away, the texts almost suddenly dropped off, but she still asked me to come out. I met her at the bar again and then the silent treatments started all over again (like she did when we were together). I thought we were just hanging out and being chill. Went back to her place and went to bed. Didn\u2019t talk about anything and no sex this night. Her other dude also text her \u201chi\u201d while we are at the bar...she didn\u2019t respond to him. \n\nWoke up in the morning and still got the silent treatment while we laid in bed watching TV. Got up to smoke and asked her about our weekend and if she was still into it. She looked at me with a huge smile and said yes this is going excellent and I\u2019m glad you\u2019re here. I then asked if I could trust her since it\u2019s been broken so many times. She laughed and said yeah you can. That was it. \n\nI left and then started getting messages like \u201c I\u2019m sorry, I don\u2019t know what I\u2019m doing, my mind is fucked up\u201d and ignoring anything I wanted to talk about.\n\nWhy did I do this? I can\u2019t believe I started to fall for it again, but glad that I recognized the warning signs. She\u2019s so damn good about manipulating me and playing into the marriage and our child. I hate this so fucking much and it rips my soul and heart into so many pieces. She knows exactly how to get a rise out of me and make me feel so lost and confused in every situation....ugh, fuck all this stupid shit and I wish she would just go away and let me be in peace.\n\nSo here\u2019s to starting my healing process all over again and going NC...again.

Four days after finding out about her 31-year-old lover (she's 48) she was openly flaunting him before my daughter and I. I was absolutely shell-shocked. \n\nFrom that moment on she turned into a different person: completely unempathetic and full of hatred. After four months of this toxicity I left her in absolute despair.\n\nDuring one of our subsequent email exchanges I'd happened to mention that the therapist I'd been seeing had told me I had 'empathetic qualities'. I never heard of such a thing before. Next day my wife contacted me demanding to know if I thought she was a narcissist. I'd never mentioned the word to her. This is her rebuttal of the notion. \n\nAs always I'll never be sure if she is a narcissist (although she matches som many of the traits.). I wondered if anyone here would care to offer an opinion on her logic. Here it is:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\"I think you need to calm down and stop being so dramatic. It\u2019s easy to paint me as evil and you as the victim and so on but these phrases are ludicrous. We have different views of the marriage \u2013 and we are unlikely to agree \u2013 not surprising. I\u2019d love you to come up with neat answers on why it happened but so far your theories are very imbalanced in your favour with no recognition of any of the support and love I gave you or how good things were between us most of the marriage. I\u2019m the wicked witch who from early on took your mojo from you by controlling you and you\u2019re poor snow white, just the kind and giving empath being taken advantage of. Fake news again. I\u2019m sorry but I\u2019m not buying it. You should know that people are complicated and multi layered and hard to figure out.\n\nI think part of the problem is that you are talking to these therapists and they don\u2019t know me, they just hear your version of events \u2013 you have no one to challenge your thinking or put another perspective. They have their boxes to fit people into \u2013 Empath, Narcissist etc and they shoe horn everyone into something and the receiver loves that as they have a label and it makes them feel better \u2013 especially the label of empath \u2013 the lovely sensitive person who gives and is taken advantage of \u2013 who wouldn\u2019t want to buy that? it\u2019s a fairy tale and its not you \u2013 it\u2019s part of you but you are so much diverse and complicated than that. you\u2019re a person of vastly different and diverse traits. But you\u2019re not actually that objective about yourself and never have been/ so it\u2019s easy to sell you this label. \u00a0\u00a0Who wouldn\u2019t like being called an empath!\n\nAnyway\u2026 my thoughts are\n\n* I want you to be well mentally and physically and to thrive\n* We should talk and keep communication lines open as each of us has clues to recovery for the other. We don\u2019t need to meet but we could. You can\u2019t view me as the monster you now clearly do if you see me face to face. Hating each other is not the road to recovery.\n* There are no \u2018real version of events\u2019 there are perspectives. You don\u2019t have a monopoly on the truth and nor do i.\n* I\u2019d like us to one day be true friends if at all possible \u2013 for us, for our daughter, and because it\u2019s the right thing and the best way.\n\nAt moments I\u2019ve hated you but not really.

She blames me as the oldest daughter for the divorce; calling me my dad\u2019s wife or that I was stealing her husband. The fits of rage were becoming worse and it was often. Once she had brought a knife in the car and told us if we weren\u2019t quiet she would use it. As I grew older I realised this was wrong and my dad didn\u2019t divorce my mum but they were arguing a lot. Again she would take this out on me and my siblings saying that we were the reason their marriage were falling apart or saying things like I should have never had two more daughters, only my two sons (we\u2019re four siblings). It all stopped when I finally got strong enough to catch her arm as she was about to hit me. My dad never did anything about this because he was always at work. She went to therapy and stopped hitting us but she still tells us that we\u2019re snakes or compares us all the time. Now that things have calmed down my parents say that it wasn\u2019t abuse and that she was just in a bad place. A couple of years ago I had gotten into the habit of arguing with her a lot, maybe the pent up anger. And now she accuses us of mentally abusing her. My family and my dad tell us to forgive her and move on. She even apologised but I can\u2019t seem to truly move on. I still live with her but next year I\u2019m going to university and I\u2019m scared because she calls my younger sister, who is of a perfectly healthy weight, anorexic and I don\u2019t want my sister to have such a bad image of her body. Sometimes when I get angry I bring up what happened and I criticise her a lot so I do feel bad but is it mental abuse like my mum says it is? I know she\u2019s done bad things but is it truly abuse and how do I forgive her and move one and not end up taking it out on her in turn in a negative way? I truly want to rebuild our relationship as she is getting better but how do I do this without the memories or the occasional flinching when she tries to hug me?

I see all the patterns but I can't seem to break free of any of them. I think I just need to vent about the most recent frustration. Some of the things he says to me are written down in books about abuse as direct examples of verbal abuse- I mean to the letter- things like \"you're so sensitive- I'm just joking. You should know that by now\" or \"that didn't happen, you're crazy\"if I stand up to a hurtful criticism. So when it happened the other night I pointed it out- that is, I told him his language is textbook abuse. He responds with: \"well you're abusive because you are always criticizing me by telling me I don't help enough around the house\". So I ask \"Asking you to help around the house is abuse?\" He says \"it is because it makes me feel bad, which is the outcome of abuse so it is definitely abusive\". I love him, I don't want to leave. He is not physically abusive and most of the time is pretty neutral (I would love a little more positivity rather than neutral, but I will take what I can get I guess), he tries to give me anything material I ask for and we have fantastic conversations; he is an incredible fur baby daddy and his ideology matches mine in all the right ways while still challenging me to think more. I just want him to recognize that the way he treats me is not ok. I know he KNOWS it, but how do I get him to care? How does one even argue with a statement like the one above when you know that he can't possibly believe that? Or if he does, well, how? After years and years of psychological study, how can you know all of these things and still treat the person you love so horribly? I know deep down this is manipulation to get me to ask even less of him and I am afraid its working. I feel so confused and constantly anxious. I rethink every word that is about to come out of my mouth as to whether it is \"worth it\". He says I have a victim complex so I constantly research how to be less of a victim. The problem is, in every other aspect of my life (except perhaps with my very demanding parents) I am assertive, confident, take responsibility for any mistakes and work to reduce future mistakes. I don't think I have a victim complex until I start thinking about our relationship, then I just feel beat down, defeated.

Since I\u2019m about to be 17, a.k.a, the age of consent where I live, I didn\u2019t feel like I was doing something wrong. No one knew we were dating. At least I think he didn\u2019t tell anyone.

I don\u2019t like force of any kind, it makes me feel horrible. But what he did next is just. Brutal. One night, after I came back from a long and exhausting research session in the library. I walk in to the living room, and I see that the television is still on. He\u2019s sitting on the couch, and I see two empty vodka bottles. I walk up to him and tap his shoulder. He turns to me, and all of a sudden gets up, starts telling how happy he is to see me. I laugh, as I saw him drunk at least three times, and he\u2019s usually really soft. There wasn\u2019t even a hint of what was coming. Or maybe I didn\u2019t see it. We laugh a little bit, then I start to take him to his bedroom, telling him that he needs to sleep.\n\nThis is where it gets, just messed up. He pushes me onto the bed and starts touching my private places. I scream in fear, telling him to stop. But he just shrugs it off and says \u2018It\u2019s fine. You\u2019ll see just how good it is.\u2019 I start yelling and trying to get away, but there\u2019s a huge difference in our sizes, as well as our strength.

Things were great. Talked/texted daily, sent photos often. Told them many of my insecurities, one big one being men hitting on/flirting with my child when they find out age/gender (19F). I (43F) was open about how awful this made me feel and that it had happened on more than one occasion. Unboyfriend (we were together at the time) promised he would never do that. I believed him. Probably foolishly. \n\nAt one point he says he loves me and I reciprocate the feelings. I truly love him even now. Even though my heart is about to be splintered beyond repair by upcoming events. \n\nA few months go by and we have dated and broken up but still text daily. I\u2019m left not knowing where we stand. Some days he is flirty and super complimentary, others like he barely knows me. Never wants to share personal information about himself. \n\nMy daughter has his phone number for emotional support as we had gone to an event that was highly sensitive to us both and I wouldn\u2019t be able to be there for her like she might need. He had offered to give her support if I would share his number. I trusted him. I trusted that he wouldn\u2019t do anything questionable. \n\nCue last weekend (after US Thanksgiving). He texts my daughter a meme and mid convo states that he feels their chats are flirty on occasion. My daughter asks who\u2019s? He states the two of their\u2019s. Says he feels \u201ca lil bad about it lol\u201d Daughter replies that she would never do that to her mom (me) and that she has a boyfriend. He says similar like he\u2019d never do that either. Daughter says she does have a flirty personality but it\u2019s not directed at him. He \u201cfeels a lil less bad about it now lol\u201d. \n\nIn the meantime, he has continued to text me. Calls me cute, beautiful, sexy, etc. \n\nOver this past weekend, daughter feels compelled to tell me about the odd flirty comment. I am visibly upset and at the same time do not hear from him for three days after leaving me on read. Think about the comment all weekend and try to not breakdown even though I feel broken and used. \n\nThen today happens. He finally texted and asked how my weekend was. I was honest and said \u201cnot great tbh hbu.\u201d He asked why. Told him I received information that hurt me very deeply. He asked \u201cohh what\u201d. Took me awhile to decide to lay it out there straight that he had said to my daughter he felt Thor texts were flirty sometimes. He said \u201cYa I told her that\u201d. No apology. Not a hint of remorse. I left it unread trying to decide what to do. He texted again that he mentioned it once he noticed and he didn\u2019t feel right about it. Still wasn\u2019t sorry. \n\nI then bluntly asked if he flirted with her. He said it was unintentional. At some point said it was unintentional and they had agreed to text less often. I asked my daughter if this was true. She said no. They had never agreed to anything regarding the amount of texting. \n\nI asked if being unintentional made it okay. Was then told to basically check my attitude. Followed up with a longer text that it was already dealt with and if I still wanted to talk fine. If I didn\u2019t, also fine. I was so shocked and trying not to breakdown (I was walking through Meijer at the time) that I couldn\u2019t respond. By the time I made it to go the car, my daughter had contacted him and said I deserved better. Next text from him was a hey sorry blah blah blah cannot keep limping this along have a great life here as a friend good luck. \n\nI thought I knew pain before today. I was wrong. Have never hurt this bad in my entire life and I have survived some horrendous traumas. I am not surviving this. Was my one last ditch effort to find love. I cannot go through this again. \n\nIf you\u2019ve read this far, thank you. I don\u2019t deserve it but I appreciate it. Have a merry Christmas y\u2019all.

Me, J and D proceeded to become close friends.\n\ni ended up going back to S because, my mother was an abusive alcoholic and i thought S was better than being with her. i saved up money and moved in with S. during this we had sex once, but i was shaking the whole time and refused to touch his skin directly, so i just got him off as quickly as possible. \n\nthis ended up not working, we broke up and J and D took me in until i got on my feet. during this time, D asked to cuddle me, was very affectionate and at first i got scared and said no to these things, but then idk, i guess i wanted to be close to someone so i started reciprocating. J told me i had to earn his trust because i had betrayed him and D by going back to S. \n\nafter awhile i lived on my own, D accidentally left his hoodie he lent me with me and said \u201che wanted me to keep it so he could comfort me while he wasnt phsyically there\u201d about a month later, out of the blue, he asked for it back which made me sad but i didnt say anything.\n\nafter a few months i started making new friends and began dating someone new. i was really..idk, just didnt feel like being friends with J and D was good for me at the time, and that i wanted to get therapy to proceed our friendship, so i told them this and they said ok and we stopped talking. i was content.\n\nabout maybe a month or a little under they basically started drama with me, and when i asked them why they said it was because they were mad i cut them off and basically implied i was ungrateful to them. which i wasnt at all. i honestly loved these people dearly, but i felt like this wasnt a healthy friendship with all the past things that happened.\n\ni ended up starting to get high a lot to forget a lot. i ended up having a really bad breakdown and moving back in with my parents because i wanted to continue my education without feeling like i had all this weight on my shoulders and because i could go back to where i had insurance and get therapy.\n\nthe thing is,  i feel like i peaked with S. i feel like that was the first time i ever experienced happiness, and it wont ever happen again. i feel pathetic, because when other people leave bad people, usually theyre hopeful and maybe even happier. but i wasnt. im in pain and wish i could go back.\n\nbut i also look at this situation and think, HOW FUCKING DUMB was i to let this all happen to me? im literally an idiot. no sane person would let this happen to them. im so fucking dumb and feel like i deserved it. i hate it. i looked at photos of me and S and feel like thats the last time i felt happiness. im so dumb. i cant emotionally connect with anyone anymore, i did this to myself. why? i know im pathetic and pity myself and wish i could stop.", "subreddit": "survivorsofabuse"}

She wanted to get bubble tea, and we\u2019ve been wanting to play LEGO Star Wars so I suggested that we go to GameStop too. She said it would be in the evening because she had studying to do, which was fine cause I had stuff to do as well. She also said she\u2019d only have a couple hours to spend, alright whatever. Not a big deal. \n\n6:39-7pm rolls around, haven\u2019t heard from her. I text her and she\u2019s not replying. I check her location and she\u2019s... at a Mexican restaurant?

I\u2019ll be like 45 minutes to an hour and then I\u2019ll pick you up\u201d.

And if you take a step back to calmly assess the situation, you can tell those hurtful comments are coming from a place of pain? I've always known that about my ex. While we were still together, I did my best to make him feel comfortable so he wouldn't feel the need to attack me. But in the end nothing I did was good enough and everything was my fault. Of course.\n\nOne thing my ex seemed obsessed with was my upbringing. Even though I went through some extreme trauma as a child, I was lucky enough to have a mother who loved me and had enough money to ensure my safety and keep me in therapy almost all my life. As a result I'm very sensitive to other people's pain and my closest friends tend to be those who have been through some serious stuff and came out on the other side. Trusting someone enough to be able to be vulnerable around them is very important to me in close relationships. I don't hide my emotions and I'd like to think I make people feel safe enough that they don't feel the need to hide either.\n\nMy ex was an island when we met. One of those people who were taught they had to be tough no matter what. Over time he felt comfortable enough to share some stuff with me. I comforted him and let him know that I cared. We got a lot closer after that. He was a lot more relaxed around me. I don't think he gave me a single snarky comment or back-handed compliment for a solid month. Then he suddenly pulled away and I was left questioning why. Things got a lot worse after that but I stayed. Any time he was being unreasonable or downright abusive I could still see that broken child standing in front of me. Maybe I was fooling myself. I don't know what to believe at this point.\n\nHe tried to hoover me the other night and I guess it worked because we argued for a solid 20 mins before I had enough and blocked him. The things he said keep popping into my head and bothering me. Like his weird comment about how I'm \"completely open and never hide anything\" while he likes to \"keep it mysterious\". He somehow tied this to my future failures in the workforce. In reality the two stressful things about my job are deadlines and people. I've proven to myself that whatever's going on in my private life, I can distance myself from it and be completely professional whenever I need to be. So why are his dumb comments getting to me? It's not so much that I'm afraid of failing at my job but I'm afraid that being this open to people is somehow the wrong thing to be. Even though I know his walls keep him nice, cozy and utterly miserable inside. And looking at people close to me, I can see that I've had a good influences on them and they trust me. Hell, I'm even friendly with all my other exes! Like, genuine friends. Meanwhile I've been in contact with two of his exes and one is scared of him while the other one still gets upset when she remembers him.\n\nI can't understand this. The whole hoover was so transparent. He feels entitled to me and he's upset that I took his toy away. It's like he's tapped so far into my emotions that I can't access my logic anymore. When will I stop feeling like the bad person, guilty of things I never did? I hate this so much.\n\nTL;DR: My ex tried to make me feel bad about who I am and it worked and I'm sad.", "subreddit": "NarcissisticAbuse"}

I can't think of how I got the soap to play with if not from her. The basement stairs led up to the kitchen and my dad spent a lot of time down there, I remember seeing his eyes rise up the stairs, seeing me making a mess and getting mad, he used to turn red, and yelling. I ran to my room and tried to hide under the blankets because I still thought that was something that kept you safe from.monsters or whatever and he came in and grabbed my ankles and shook me hard back and forth to keep slamming me into the headboard. I don't think I've ever trusted him since. \n\nI remember a hole in the wall from him picking up a Barbie house and throwing it. I remember him pushing the cats face into her vomit as a way of telling her not to do that. I remember drawing on the wall of the basement when I was a little older, a tiny purple heart because that was my mom's favorite color and I was proud I had just figured out how to draw hearts. My dad saw it and picked me up by the collar yelling and shaking me and my mom told him to put me down so he threw me onto the floor. I think I was probably 2 or 3. I remember coming out of my room that night after crying for a long time and asking her for a kiss goodnight. She told me she only missed good little girls goodnight and told me to go to bed.\n\nI remember them fighting a lot. My bed was on the opposite wall from their room and I would stay up as long as I could to make sure my mom was ok because I didn't trust him. I remember once her fingernail getting bent back or something and her running into my room late at night thinking I was asleep and crying on the end of my bed. \n\nI remember telling her she should divorce him when I was 8. I remember playing run away from home and sitting under my neighbors bush two houses down and trying to imagine a life there. \n\nI remember them getting Hooked on Phonics and being so excited by all the new books to read that I opened it up and started reading. I remember getting yelled at and being told that was for my brother. \n\nI remember my dad driving erratically when he was mad and my mom being scared. I remember once the door to his car in the back opened and I almost fell out but grabbed ahold of my seatbelt and my mom reached back and scooped me back in. \n\nI remember him driving me and my brother to McDonald's to get Happy meals and being excited and talking about what kind of toy I might get and getting out of the car and him yelling that we were there to get food not toys and to get back into the car and that we were going home. \n\nI remember at Texas Roadhouse it was when we were little and started ordering for ourselves. I was scared and didn't know what sides to pick and said mashed potatoes and corn. My dad turned red and got angry at the table about me choosing two starches, I remember the waitress being visibly uncomfortable and me turning red and trying really hard not to cry and looking down for the rest of the night. \n\nI remember having a hand me down bed and an old firm mattress that hurt my back so much that I slept on the floor a lot instead. I remember my brother getting a new red bunk bed. I remember getting an old hand me down pink bike from my grandma when my brother got to pick out a new one. I remember getting my mom's old car while my brother insisted on a BMW for himself. \n\nI remember my mom saying they weren't going to have any more kids because she had me and my brother at once, twins, and it was perfect because they got a boy and a girl. I remember her saying that parents liked boys better because girls could get pregnant. I remember her saying I would have more girl friends if I stopped wearing such low cut shirts when I was like 14. I remember her laughing in the car while on the phone with her friend when I told her I got my first period and telling me she thought that must've already happened a long time ago. I remember she didn't hang up and kept talking to her friend instead of me and I looked out the window while we drove to the grocery store. \n\nI remember being afraid all the time. I remember being made fun of at school because I was quiet and would blush bright red when I got embarrassed, frequently. I remember crying at school a lot and not knowing what to say to people. I remember my brother and his friends making fun of me. I remember when I first started sweating, I was in elementary school and would sweat all the time because I was always nervous so I started only wearing hoodies since you couldn't see it. I remember my dad getting upset any time anyone was sick and singing the word \"quarantine\" while keeping us in our rooms and being scared of the phrase \"I hear a cough\" so I would stifle them with towels and pillows. I remember getting a rash on my arm and being afraid to tell them, then playing some game in 2nd or 3rd grade where we sat in a circle and put out our arms in the middle and somehow my sleeve fell up, when I was only wearing sweaters, and my teacher asked to see my wrist. I remember her rolling up both my sleeves and gasping and turning red because the class could see my arms, they were covered in ring worm. I remember my mom yelling at me for not telling her. I remember being so itchy but not allowed to touch my skin that mosquito bites didn't itch for years. \n\nI started cutting myself when I was probably 12. I talked about it in a chat group and a creepy dude asked for pictures so I took and sent them, my brother slid a printed copy under my door. He wasn't asking if I was ok he was letting me know that he knew because he would leverage things he knew about me against my fear of our parents to have power over me. He would hide around corners and tackle me and start fights, he would go into my room and take things. \n\nWhen we got older he would go through my phone and try to beat me up if he found anything about weed on it. He was smoking weed and doing coke in highschool but convinced our parents I had a drug problem. I started lying a lot while they all kept calling me a liar and a victim. I heard the word victim a lot. Once I was hoping to brush my teeth before school and asked him to scoot over in the bathroom while he was combing his hair and he whipped his fist back into my face and gave me a bloody nose. We were like 16, I ran downstairs crying to my mom and she believed him when he said he was combing his hair and his hand had slipped. \n\nI got raped 3x in a row by my first ever boyfriend freshman year, the first time on the floor of a bathtub with the lights off and door locked and shower running and me screaming so loud to try and get the neighbors to hear. The second time after he cried and apologized and said he didn't realize it hurt and wrapped me in a towel and carried me to his bed because I was too shaky to walk and then told me the second time didn't hurt as bad and did it again. I cried after and he talked me down, apologizing, until he wanted to again and I managed to say no, I stuttered the word no the entire time probably 40 times, he didn't even stop when his mom called, he held my mouth shut and answered his phone and talked to her for a few seconds. No one had ever talked to me about sex before, I didn't know what rape was until three days later when I told a friend and she told me I should call the cops. I was afraid my parents would think I was a slut and I was embarrassed I had lost my virginity but knew it was kind of important and didn't think anyone else would want me so I should probably just date this guy. He was abusive, we dated for over a year. \n\nIt was so bad my band teachers took me into the office to talk to me about how he treated me at school. My English teachers did too. I eventually smacked him so hard in front of the marching band that his lip ring went flying across the room, I think he was making fun of me to a girl he'd cheated on me with, and the whole marching band actually applauded. He was an asshole to a lot of people. \n\nGoing to school with him was really hard and it motivated me to pursue and art boarding school. I told my gram it was my dream, which yes I loved art class but really I wanted more than anything to get away from this guy. He and his friends had started using heroin and I felt like if I stayed there I would end up on drugs. I didn't tell my parents that, I said that they were talking about cutting the arts at school and I was good enough to get a scholarship to a really impressive place. \n\nAfterwards my mom would always say my dad thought that Interlochen ruined me. I really wanted to tell her that getting raped a bunch was probably it but I never trusted her enough to be that vulnerable. I resented them a lot for never talking to me about sex or preparing me for how guys can treat women. \n\nI would sneak out of the house to hang out with friends late and generally do mundane things that felt cool because it was midnight. Once, my dad caught me sneaking back in and lost it. He drug me into the house by my arm screaming about where I was, he pulled me up the stairs and threw me into the floor of my room and told me to clean it. I was running track at the time and after a few minutes he came back with my shoes and told me to put them on. He drove me to the track and made me run for a couple hours, I puked, at one point I told him I had to go to the bathroom and he told me I could pee down my leg. I held it and eventually he let me use the porta-potty that was out there. It really just sucked because it made me hate running when I was actually kind of proud of it. \n\nI remember my cousin's Christmas party where my extended family kept asking me how I was. I remember my cousin Jeff being the only one with the balls to ask if I was doing heroin. I have never, I'd had it cut and offered in front of me but no I had standards. I had an anxiety problem not a drug problem. My mom had already told my entire extended family that I was on heroin without saying anything to me.\n\nI didn't want to go to college because I couldn't figure out what I wanted to do. My mom insisted and I went to OSU but cut classes to do hoodrat shit with my friends. I had started hanging out with party people who went to music festivals and sold drugs and were really nice and fun, that I wasn't intimidated by to the point of silence and honestly the music scene probably helped that since like everyone had something in common by all being at the same show. When my mom found out I was failing she cried and my dad cornered me and said if I ever made my mom cry again he would \"nigger-beat me down the street\" and since I was 18 CPS couldn't do anything about it. I bagged up my things and threw them from my window that night and ran away. I didn't talk to them for 8 months. \n\nI lived in a trap house bathed in drugs and started painting to try and make money since I couldn't even handle a basic job interview, I would start shaking and be unable to look people in the eye. I smoked weed for anxiety and tripped occasionally but I wasn't doing anything extreme. My boyfriend at the time did get blackout drunk and take my favorite painting off the wall, break it over his knee, and chase me trying to stab me with it until I grabbed a can and hit him in the shin and my roommate came down and clocked him. They threw him out that night.\n\n My grandma convinced me to come back in a tense reunion where I was so scared I couldn't stop crying and my mom said such memorable things as \"I don't care about you any more, it hurts too much.\" My mom has always been dramatic. I remember holding her when I was ten and her dad died and when I was 11 and her step dad died. \n\nMy gram convinced her to chill and I stayed there for a month or two before college in Chicago, SAIC with a big scholarship and all the promise in the world. Mom shortly after lost her job and art school seemed like too much. My parents talked a lot about how they never 'got' art, at my senior thesis they didn't even read my artist's statement because they thought it would be \"too personal.\" My mom talked about money every time we talked and I felt like such a selfish burden that I dropped out after a semester and came home to Columbus to live with a guy I had met so I wouldn't be my parent's problem anymore. \n\nWe lived in the actual hood, gunshots every night, hookers in the alley behind our house, I had at least 2 guns pulled on me over three years, my brother's guy friend actually got gang raped after getting off the bus on our corner, a meth lab blew up a street over....like seriously it was a shit show. It blows my mind that I stayed in that situation for so long and my parents never objected or wanted any better for me. \n\nMy friend Cali saved my life. The guy was toxic and would belittle me so frequently I'm not sure how it blended into my concept of love. His life became my first problem, class didn't matter if it meant I didn't have time to clean the house before he got home because then we'd be up until 3am as he listed all the reasons I didn't deserve to live there and how much he did for me that I didn't appreciate. He crashed my car twice, got into a police chase while drunk with me in the passenger seat, got a DUI so I would drive him to work at 6:30 every morning when my classes started at 10 and if I was even five minutes late to pick him up he would call me screaming. I took him to court, I did the household everything, when his mom let his little sister drop out of college I spent a day driving her to the principal, her mom's work, and the board of education to make sure she could get her GED. I loved them really, at least they were a family, and I knew he had a lot of shit to work out in his past which making him my project helped me ignore my issues, but he was genuinely pretty terrible to me. \n\nI moved in with Cali's basement at a cheap rate and worked at a grocery store and reconnected with a highschool best friend who is always felt pretty strongly towards. We vibed heavy and could laugh at dumb jokes for five hours easily. He accidentally got me pregnant and his first response was to make a joke about scraping out my ovaries with a coat hanger and to let me know if I wanted child support I'd have to sue him. \n\nWhen I worked up the courage to tell my mom I had gotten an abortion months later she was a little shocked and I said since it was early I was able to just take the pills and then she blew it off as plan b despite me crying in the mall parking lot and her being a pharmacist. \n\nI'm 27 and about to graduate from community college with an associate degree. I've been working on a 2 year degree for 6 years. In school growing up I never scored below the 92nd percentile on standardized tests and MIT actually wrote me a letter senior year asking to apply. But it's taken me almost a decade to complete an associates and I don't want my parents anywhere near it because I think the systemic down talking wrecked my head for a really long time and became a major barrier for me because I was unable to set boundaries for myself in how people were allowed to treat me. \n\nI've worked really hard to turn my life around. I work in a restaurant that is easily one of the best in the city and own a condo I am renovating that is already estimated at 30k above what I bought it at in only 3 years and that's without the renovations I've done. I failed like 20 classes but after retaking them I am graduating on Friday. I got the news from my admissions counselor, she actually called me herself to let me know, that I got into CCAD for the spring despite my absolute shit GPA. \n\nI talked to my mom for an hour today and the first time I mentioned it she didn't hear me, I mentioned it again and she said \"oh, that's exciting, when do classes start?\" \"The 13th with orientation on the 10th!\" \"Oh I have training for work on the tenth...\" And then she goes into talking about work again. I probably emailed this counselor 20x to make sure I put my absolute best foot forward on this application and had to explain those years in an abusive relationship that were embarrassingly visible on my transcript, I've never wanted anything more in my life than this, I actually cried and called my boyfriend who was just thrilled for me and never doubted it. My mom hardly even acknowledged it. \n\nI'm honestly not upset at this point but it has forced me to look at all this family shit I haven't forgiven. I know my past is my fault but I think it's fucked up my dad always had me afraid of my own house and my mom never stood up for me. I think it's fucked my brother could grab me by the ponytail and throw me down the stairs when we were 16 and not get in trouble for it. I think that lowered my self esteem to the point it left me vulnerable to shit people that took advantage of that and I didn't know any better until I had some sociology and psych classes.\n\nMy brother flips if I ever say our dad was abusive, he says things like since he didn't molest me I have nothing to complain about because people have it so much worse. I just have always resented so much that lack of bond or safety or care and when I first heard the phrase \"neglect is child abuse\" a lot of things clicked for me. I remember being locked in my room a lot, crying and trying to push open the door while my mom held it shut reading a book or something. I remember my favorite baby sitter's boyfriend coming over and taking me to the grocery in his truck and putting his hand on my lap when he got a frantic phone call and drove back to find my parents firing her. They never talked to me about it. I remember washing my bits obsessively with a bar of soap and not knowing why when I was little. I remember hating myself more than anything and being suicidal at a very young age. \n\nI want them to apologize. I don't want to hear \"congratulations\" when they talk down to me so noticably that every partner I've brought home has commented on it after. I feel like I've accomplished anything in my life despite of them and honestly I never want to see my shit head father again because even though it's been almost ten years, I don't doubt he'd still throw me across a room if inclined. I keep having panic attacks, reliving those childhood moments that scared me so deeply, that everyone else in my family has just completely ignored. It pisses me off that I've spent so much time crying about the past because I would never treat a little kid like that and I just don't know if I can ever really forgive him, if it's worth the effort to try, or if he would ever acknowledge that he hurt me.\n\n\nTLDR: My first memory is my dad throwing me around for playing with soap on the face of an oven, he's historically had anger issues and made me feel unsafe, and now that I'm graduating I'm having panic attacks before bed about things from childhood. By diminishing my feelings and making me feel powerless over myself, I think it contributed to rapes that took me a long time to process and move past which also led me to various abusive relationships since I felt worthless. He's coming to my graduation but I wish I could tell him to stay home. Should I try and reconcile or blow up my family by letting him know he's a piece of shit.", "subreddit": "abuse"}

My narc ex left me three years ago and I got over it without getting psychological advice. However, my family tells me I'm still traumatised by this relationship. The subject of my narc comes up in many conversations, and I see that especially my mother is a bit tired of hearing me talk about him. I think she believes that I'm exaggerating and that I also was to blame for the toxicity of that relationship, because I stood up to him and I was angry all the time. I've never told her that he once sexually abused me because I don't want her to suffer.\n\nWhen this POS dumped me, I wrote a list of the things he did to me, so I wouldn't forget, and so in the future, I would recognize the red flags in other men.\n\nReading this sub has helped me a lot, because now I really know I was gaslighted, and that you can be an intelligent, worthy person and still be mistreated by a narc without even noticing it.

I stayed in hotels and shelters with the kids for the first week and a half then I got a car and a roommate. He was mad about that because he specifically said he wanted me to not sign any leases and basically sit in the shelter and let him sort his head out which I could not do the two children. So at the children's pick up/drop off yesterday, I had an interview earlier in the day so my hair and makeup was done and I had a really nice outfit on. He had always obsessed over my looks always told me I was out of his league I hadn't really thought about this setting him off because he doesn't seem to have any feelings at all. Since the pickup/ drop-off yesterday he has been blowing up my phone about how for the last 6 months I was always with the baby I never did my hair never did my makeup now a month after our divorce I'm doing my hair and my makeup dressing pretty so that must mean I have a new man in my life. He keeps telling me all I had to do was sit and wait for him to figure this out and we would have still been a family and been in our home that we had just bought.

I said no. You said you will trust me. So stop it. \n\nHe got mad. Started throwing tantrums. Calling me names and 'disobedient'.

So he would never reply to my messages, just went cold turkey.\n\nFinally a week later after me begging him to reply back and talk to me.. he said \"only after you send me the screenshot I asked you for\". Me being so desperate to talk to him at the time, I gave in. Sent him the stupid screenshot of all of my conversations.

Violating my privacy. They read my journals and then told me that they were \"obsessive\". Threats. My mother continually threatened to look through my phone (even after I became a legal adult) - then set herself up as the savior when she described herself as too merciful to do that. From the earliest age I can remember, I have walked on egg shells - always afraid to show them who i really was. Cause i knew I would just get criticized for it.

It even occured that we didn't communicate at all for several days. But when we were together it was just perfect. She told me that I was everything she ever looked for. We did so many things together, went to vacation it was just great. But after a while, she tried to change me. First of all, she told me I don't know how relationships work because my last relationship was several years ago. So in every disagreement she took this card and told me how it had to work and what I had to do. If I did something \"wrong\" she treated me with the cold shoulder. There were even occasions where I clearly made a joke where she didn't talk to me until I apologized. She in contrast told me my flaws right into my face but said, that this is \"not a problem for her, because she likes it that way\". Mostly all of her compliments were like that.\n\nSeveral weeks before she moved to my city we agreed that she can leave her cat at my place so she can be a little bit more relaxed packing up her stuff, moving and all those things.\n\nOur relationship began to break when we had a game night with friends and I touched a female friend in a friendly way on her shoulder. She demanded me to stop that, I told her that this is to much, why should I stop touching people in a friendly manner just because they have a specific gender. Aside from that she demanded already weird things from me in the relationship which i gave in to (for example, not wearing a specific type of pants because it irritates her?!). Over a course of several weeks with no contact, very mean things said by her, ultimatums by her to stop touching other females at all, more no contact it seemed like we found an agreement that she is now fine with me touching my female friends (for example patting their shoulders). She already moved to my city and I thought, if we found an agreement, it would be nice if we've seen each other again. I asked her several times to meet each other, but except for breadcrumbs and bad excuses over a course of 3 weeks, we didn't meet, after that I broke it off with her. She did not acknowledge my break-up via text. She just answered with something completely out of context. This all happened at the end of summer. I was so hurt, confused. For several months, I had the hardest time ever, no sleep, no appetite, no productive work. It was horrible...\n\nNow the weird thing, her cat still lives with me, after all that time, and she does not seem to be interested in picking her up. I'm so confused.\n\nIs that some kind of tactic?

But the thing to understand is the ONLY reason that narcissist did not discard you before and discarded you later is that the situation for them at a particular time was FAVOURABLE. As we all know, narcissist have to be in control of EVERYTHING. They also need to have control over when the relationship ends. It solely depends on the circumstances of the narcissist. \nThe narcissist POSTPONED your discard because breaking up at the time was not favourable to them. \nNow, there is a contradiction in my above statement. We often say Narcissist are always backed up with supply, which is true. But, guys we overestimate their capacity. Not all supply can be enough for the narcissist. At a particular time, one supply will be favourable while one might not. So they keep jumping from one to another. The moment the supply balance tilts towards the new one, the old one is discarded.

During this time he mostly kept his hands to himself, although some touches made me uncomfortable, as did comments about my body. One result of growing up in this environment is that I don't trust myself to recognize normal father-daughter interactions. I ended up cutting off contact with him sometime in college for a variety of reasons. However, I have maintained contact with my stepbrother.\n\n(I can add aliases if the lack of names is too confusing)\n\nI feel very sure that my former stepdad was sexually inappropriate with me. Lately, though, I  have been reevaluating my relationship with my former stepbrother. When I was a preteen (again, this time period is a blur, not sure of my exact age) my stepbrother and I engaged in a series of sexual encounters, mostly exploratory touching, although on a few occasions he had me give him oral sex. At the time I felt like I was willing and it was mutual since we were so close in age. Years past and we grew up and both moved on with our lives and never spoke about it. Lately I have been wondering if I was taken advantage of. My feelings are also influenced by something that I heard as a teenager. A woman that my stepdad dated while I was living with him during high school told me that my stepbrother had told her \"\\[sister\\] and I aren't related by blood so we can do whatever we want.\" The fact that he was thinking along these lines when we were teenagers, he probably around 18 at this point, made me a little sick.\n\nRecently I blocked him on Facebook rather impulsively. He reached out and I lied and said it must have happened accidentally. We exchanged addresses to send Christmas gifts and he said \"I miss your face\" which gave me the creeps, though I can't put my finger on why.\n\nTL:DR sexual abuse as a child has made me question what's normal between family members. Can an older brother take advantage of a little sister if they are only a few years apart? Should I cut my stepbrother out of my life like I did his father? I don't know what to think but continuing with the status quo doesn't feel right.", "subreddit": "abuse"}

There were more holes punched in the walls of our house than I care to admit. He\u2019s broken or otherwise seriously injured his hands multiple times from lashing out when angry. He used threats of suicide or divorce toward me when he wasn\u2019t getting his way in big arguments, even in front of the kids. He used sex as a means to hurt be because \u201cI was mad at you\u201d a few days before he had the last big fit. He took pictures and videos of him hurting me. During his fit, he showed those pictures and videos of me during that encounter to our male neighbors. He told me if I didn\u2019t want them to know I was a whore, I should never have cheated on him...I didn\u2019t, by the way. He\u2019s done and said unforgivable things to me, and now to our children by abandoning them and his responsibilities to us in the separation.\n\nBut I miss him. I miss him so much it\u2019s like a piece of my soul left with him. When he wasn\u2019t having those bursts of anger he truly was the perfect husband and father. He was so present with our kids and I, he made me feel safe, he made me feel equal and loved. He did the dishes when I cooked, he cleaned up the messes I inadvertently leave places while distracted. We danced in the kitchen, we sang on long car rides. We kissed and held and loved each other in front of our kids. He talked to me and understood me, he shared his secrets with me and I kept them safe. I loved him so much, and for the first time in my life I felt unconditionally loved back. It was only in these awful moods he would get in that he was so horrible or ever even a semblance of abusive. I was happy, truly happy in my marriage.\n\nI\u2019m in a difficult place mentally now. It\u2019s only been 8 months, the divorce isn\u2019t finalized, and he\u2019s already \u201cmoved on\u201d with someone new. I can\u2019t get there. I miss him so much. I can\u2019t properly get intimate with another person. That encounter where he hurt me was the last sexual encounter we had together. I don\u2019t know if I can\u2019t move on and I\u2019m as injured emotionally as I am because I am so broken hearted, or if it\u2019s effects from the trauma, or both. I\u2019m so confused all the time because of how he treats me now; like he\u2019s disgusted with me all the time. I don\u2019t understand where my husband went mentally, or if he ever really existed at all. I\u2019m scared that maybe he\u2019s right and I am crazy, and so crazy that I made him up; the vision of who he was that I had. Maybe he was this guy all along, and I had a monster in my bed, raising my babies with me. \n\nI keep praying that this was some sort of psychological break and that he\u2019ll go get appropriate help and come home. It keeps not happening though. His family has taken his side, and is perpetuating that I am crazy and made up the abuse instead of getting him the help he needs. I can\u2019t shake the idea that if he just got the right help, we could be okay again. I\u2019m also kind of stuck in this \u201cin sickness and in health\u201d mentality where I feel like I\u2019m abandoning him to his sickness by accepting defeat and letting it have him. I feel like if he could just clear his head and be himself as I new him, we\u2019d be fine. We all wouldn\u2019t have to go through this divorce. We\u2019d be safe. We\u2019d be loved.\n\nI\u2019ve been feeling really empty and sad lately from missing him. I\u2019m wondering if anyone else is dealing with similar issues. Is it just from the brainwashing on my end? Does it ever go away? Will I ever get to feel \u201cwhole\u201d again? I feel like I\u2019ll never feel whole or be able to love again, and like my one soulmate I get this lifetime is gone.", "subreddit": "survivorsofabuse"}

With my nex I basically learned that any conflict that occurred would somehow be used against me. I had not realized at the time that this was what made me so anxious, but basically while I was with my nex - and for quite some time after - I was hardly able to function whenever there was a conflict occurring. I was obsessing over ways how to voice my point of view in a way that he could finally understand and respect. I wasn't able to let go. Waiting for the fight to properly start (\"we'll talk about this when I get home\") or continue (\"I'm tired. Let's talk about this tomorrow.\") was pure torture for me even though the requests in themselves are perfectly reasonable. \"Don't go to bed angry\" was used against me, just as having a good nights sleep to cool down - whatever suited his agenda better. When I wanted to resolve things he would suddenly get very tired and I was wrong for keeping him from sleeping, when I was tired myself I was wrong for wanting to go to bed angrily.\n\nBut it was not only that. It was the same with \"enjoying romantic moments\": with him there was a certain way romance worked. When there was something remotely symbolically he expected me to be in a good mood and enjoy it, no matter what. If I even dared to be sick or annoyed I was ruining his complete day and had not a bone of romance in me and didn't care for him. \n\nOr with visiting friends. If we took the car I was completely dependent on when he wanted to leave. Was I tired I was expected to just find some place to sleep a little - even if I was getting sick and we had agreed to some time I wanted to be in bed. Would this be a time frame he would take about half an hour past the latest moment possible and then I was overreacting, because it was \"only half an hour\". If we took the subway and I wanted to leave early on my own, I was told that I was ruining everyone's party. Because if I left, I would \"give others the idea to leave, too\" and therefore would break up the party. So I started excusing myself from parties with \"not feeling well\", but even that was not okay. What were others supposed to think about me if I was \"again feeling unwell\"?!?\n\nOr when I told him how I needed him to handle a sensitivity of me, I wasn't allowed to change my needs. \"You told me three years ago that you wanted me to do this.\" Yes I did. Now I'm telling you that I need something else. Please adjust to that. \"You can't expect me to remember that if you change your mind every other day\"... He changed his mind about our future every other day and I was expected to deal with that but I wasn't allowed to change how I needed him to handle my needs once after a few years?\n\nThey use something completely normal - something that should be positive for you - and they twist it up and set you up for failure until you can't handle it anymore. And then you are \"unreasonable\" and \"overreacting\" while they \"only wanted a nice evening with you\" or \"only did what is right/expected from them\", so they obviously can't be held accountable.", "subreddit": "NarcissisticAbuse"}

I'm annoyed but not surprised at how slow are judicial system is and how utterly unfair it seems.  Even with pretty strong evidence and independent reports from DCF the DA still is pushing for a trial.  Lawyer tells me it's normal procedure yet it angers me to be put through the ringer when the evidence clearly shows shes lying.\n\nOver the last few months she's emailed me and called me several times even with the no contact order that she initiated - seeing her name on my display makes me sick to my stomach - it's an instant reaction even now.  Lawyer says her contacting me is good continues to show that her actions contradict her statements.  I haven't answered or replied yet she continues.  Part of me wants to pick up.  What could you possibly have to say after everything you did.  Sorry for lying to the cops, getting you arrested, and hurting your children.  \n\nShe completely disgusts me yet on occasion I know I miss her.

Rinse and repeat that same cycle and down the rabbit hole you go.  Deeper and deeper you fall and it's pretty crazy how fast everything happens.  \n\nFor everyone who has started the journey out I can tell you firsthand it's a difficult one but worth it.

She was my first same sex experience and so many things about it were so much more than I thought a relationship could be.  I loved every piece of her, every hair on her head and freckle on her face and I thought she felt the same. I\u2019m in the process of ending a 20 year relationship/marriage and never in my life had I experienced being with someone I was passionate about.  Now I know what it is like to have that kind of desire for someone. \n\nShe became really distant a couple of weeks ago.

I finally demanded an explanation which she claimed was needing time to \u201cfigure things out.\u201d \n\nY\u2019all, I have been so dumb. So fucking naive. I\u2019m so embarrassed to admit she told me at the very, very beginning she was a sociopath but because she is an \u201cempathic sociopath\u201d she was capable of love. But this is classic, right? I would love her through it. I would be the rare exception. She loved me as ardently as I did her. We were planning a future together. \n\nI have never experienced a more intense emotional pain than what I experienced after our conversation yesterday. I did the most awful thing. I literally begged her to take me back. Begged her to flip the switch back on that made her love me.

Still trying to get those fully out of my system, I guess.\n\nMaybe you are trying the same, so I'm gonna type some thoughts on that out here. And in doing so, can maybe get some of it further into my brain as well :) \n\nThese myths might not always get told in those exact words, instead they can be conveyed differently, even non-verbally:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* *The big myth above them all:* Abuse is normal and acceptable.  \n*Truth:* You have been conditioned to believe your abuser(s) in that their behaviour is loving, good, considerate, and that you are somehow faulty - you wouldn't accept bad treatment otherwise. In fact, however, they do nothing but use you, without emotional regard for you as a person.  \nIt doesn't matter if they do it in a consciously planned way or in an instinctual way or both - the reality is that they are \"broken\" and stuck in an emotional and developmental stage below that of mature people. (Huge thanks to the admins for getting that point across again and again, also concerning inverted social reward!)  \n\n* *Myth (it's a version of the big myth above):* Emotional abuse is not really a thing. It's just the game of life and you are a loser, you are too weird/weak/sensitive to play it. It's just how \"normal\" assertive people behave in life to reach their goals, and you aren't fit for it.  \n*Truth:* Emotional abuse is a big thing. Quite many people - though probably not a majority - are in fact abusive personalities, and they will try to get what they want from you. They will verbally twist and bend the truth to pretend that what they do is the opposite of abuse, that they just care for you so much, that there really is no such thing as abuse, precisely to make you question yourself and do what they want.  \n(Most) humans are not just reptiles though. We are mammals who care for their close ones, and even more we are humans with the capacity for creativity, for sprituality, for satisfying desires AND more than that, for creating things big and beautiful together. Try to remember when you were the happiest - when you got what you wanted, possibly against the wants/needs of someone else, or when you contributed to others in some way and felt how you made things better for yourself AND others? Would you want a life without the latter? You are not a loser for enjoying the latter and seeing through the bleakness of the former - you are the opposite really.\n\n* *Myth:* There is a difference between actual narcissists/cluster B personalities/high-conflict personalities/broken people/abusers and just \"garden variety jerks/assholes\", the latter being good people who just behave badly.  \n*Truth:* The two are basically the same thing. There are no people who consistently hurt/mistreat/attack one or more persons around them, deny this hurtful behaviour, and still magically they themselves are healthy, happy, nonbroken. ALL mature people have the spark of empathy, and that is enough to make their actions nonabusive. Sure, they are still humans and can make bad decisions, criticize, hurt and/or leave you, but you can feel they feel bad about hurting someone else, that it's not meant to attack you at your core. You are emotionally considered as a person.  \nWith abusers, however, even their \"nice\" actions are not nice in order to connect with you in a healthy way, but in order to tear down your boundaries and get what they want without emotional regard for you. In that sense they are always abusive and attacking you.  \nYour gut is actually quite good at detecting the difference, but if you're like me, your conscious mind has been conditioned over decades to disregard your own gut. I believe that \"asshole\", to a large degree, is just the word instinctively used by healthy people who haven't (yet ;)) been through abuse to describe abusers.  \n\n* *Myth:* There is a narcissistic spectrum, and the amount/severity of narcissistic traits determine how much of an abuser a person is.  \n*Truth:* Not really. It seems more accurate to me that there are two spectrums (and again, the inspiration for that comes from the awesome admins and some other sources).  \nThe first spectrum is that of narcissistic traits, like how grandiose one is, how entitled one feels to receive special treatment, how much one needs admiration, how envious one is etc. This is a real continuum. And there can be people who have lots of strong narcissistic traits (Im thinking showbiz for example) but they do have emotional empathy, and while they do indulge in their traits, they are still in touch with the emotional reality of others around them, they do not disregard other people at their core. If you have to do with them, you can openly perceive their narcissistic traits as such, they can acknowledge who they are and you are not deceived to believe they want your best like you are by abusers.  \nThe second spectrum, and this is the more important one, is really just an either-or thing: A person is an abuser or not. If someone is an abuser, they don't have emotional empathy, and with it comes that host of abusive aspects - they enjoy to submit others to their wants, even hurt them, want to exploit, are envious, can lie and cheat without remorse etc. On this second spectrum, there is only normal/empathetic or 180-degrees-disturbed/inverted social reward. There are no people who are \"just 90 degrees\" on that spectrum. So there can very well be abusers who are quite low in (some) narcissistic traits from the first spectrum. They don't need to be super grandiose etc., they are really lowbrow. Still, they are abusive in the sense of the second spectrum, they are content with just you around to destroy for their own pleasure.  \nI believe the DSM criteria are not differentiated enough in that sense. Need for admiration or some other traits really describe nonpathological things that many people have to some degree, and they are not by any means as abusively destructive as no empathy, a want for power over others, to exploit and put others down etc. (and again, the latter really are either-or traits).  \nThis \"nondistinction\" contributes to victims believing they are abusers themselves when they just recognize some of the \"nonpathological\" narcissistic traits in themselves.  \n\n* *Myth:* It's okay in some interactions with others that you feel completely disregarded, because sometimes you are really THAT wrong to deserve bad treatment.  \n*Truth:* That's never okay.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOh heck this turned out long... thank you for reading through it all and for any kind of feedback.

He mocks my crying. After he\u2019s done going off on me he wants to work things out and make things right between us. He refuses to leave me alone. We live in a small studio apartment. The only room with a door is our bathroom. I often lock myself in there. He will bang on the door, try to pick the lock, and unscrew the door handle. The other day he claimed he needed to pee and that if I didn\u2019t get the f*** out he was going to pee on the floor and have me clean it up (he didn\u2019t actually). On the day of our worst fight he desperately wanted to have sex. I told him I did not want to.

But I keep re-reading the message as being \"too nice\". It was detached which Im proud of but I should have went off and told him he never loved me or cared about me. He's just gonna think that I think he took me for granted. Hell, I told him I wish him well! Wtf!!? It comes across as so weak and nice to me. Sigh. At that point I owned up to the fact that I was being abused but until 2 days after I sent it, did I start having the REAL memories of the sheer torture that went on and I got so angry and wanted to send him another message to inform him of the severity of his abuse but I didnt.\n\nMy final message read: \n\nHi,\n\nI just want to let you know that I wont be using this e-mail address after today. I have focused a lot of my energy on the outcome of will it or wont it in terms of whatever it is we are doing and a large part of that has been waiting for a conversation that I never received when I asked or has been up in the air.  I choose to no longer do that.I realized a lot over the last few months and realize what is best for me. I will be putting my energy in myself and put myself first because I will always have my back, I will always listen to myself and never take myself for granted and I will be doing so by myself (ie: as a single person). I am no longer going to wait. I choose me. \n\nI wish you well.\n\n-Advicewhatz", "subreddit": "NarcissisticAbuse"}

Thing is she will go a day without responding to me and I don't assume anything negative. I just figure shes busy and tired and will get back to me when available or ready. (she has a kid, I don't) One of the reasons I'm sticking to the no contact. I'm tired of being her therapist and hearing every detail of her life on a daily basis giving her constant reassurance and compliments walking on eggshells to make her feel better about her insecurities on a daily basis.

Sorry in advance for the bad grammar, English it's not my mother tongue.\n\nI'm  a 21y/o girl, I live with both my parents and my older brother. My  house has always been a pretty tense environment, since my father has been retired for 26 years because of a car accident and my mother was faced with the responsibility of taking care of her two younger sisters and my late alcoholic grandma since my grandpa died when she was 16. My father has all his junk around the flat, it has cracks and  holes, we do not live confortably. This year the arguments between my father and I started to rise.\n\nOn  june I finished my job as a graphic design intern and the company wanted to pay me, in that moment I didn't have a bank account so the money was temporarily deposited into my father's account. I asked him via text if he could withdraw this quantity. When he came back home I asked about  the money and he said I didn't tell him anything about it, and my  response was that I thought he knew since the text was marked as read. He then **accused me of calling him a liar in his fucking face and in his own fucking house, stood up really close to me and** **screamed that he wouldn't smash my fucking face in but he was close to**, I got up and screamed that I wasn't doing that, he told me to fuck off  and left the room. I spent the evening with my boyfriend, crying, and I  went to therapy. The next day he tried to talk like nothing happened, showing interest even in my studies and what was I going to do after I  finished school (sth he never does) but I wasn't reciprocating like he  wanted me to, I answered his questions and nothing more and told me to **\"fix my face because I looked sick and had a problem\"** and left.\n\nThree months later we had an argument over frozen pizza in which he said to  my mother that he wasn't arguing at all, that I started it and when I answered that I wasn't the one screaming he told me **he would pack my shit and throw it out, myself included**.\n\nYesterday my computer wasn't working after a five days trip, my father said he  decided to switch it off from behind while I was away, when I started the computer, it made a weird noise, he accused my mother of moving the computer and she denied it, but anyway. The point is that it didn't start, he tried to fix it but wasn't working, he told me it was my fault  for opening it, cleaning the insides and overall touching it, accused me of accusing him of being responsible and threatened me again because  he didn't like me face (I obviously was angry and serious all the time  and he ordered me to stop looking like that), he said **\"I will not kick the shit out of you because your fucking mother is right here but next time you say sth I'll mess you up**\".  My mother only reacted to the \"fucking mother\" thing. I was furious and  whispered \"leave\". He kept saying that I should've waited for my  brother to come back from work even though he helped me open the  computer and when I told him let's wait for my brother he responded **\"It's my fucking house, deal with it.\"**  I left home and spent again the evening with my boyfriend after my  brother came and fixed the computer. Before that, I talked to my mother  and she told me that I should not talk to my father like that and that I  should be grateful for everything my father has done for me.This  morning I was scared, I tried to avoid my father at all cost, hid in the  bathroom, waited til he left the kitchen to have breakfast, shaked all  the time, tears came to my eyes with every noise he did. He put a table  in front of my room to do his botched job (sth he never does, he has his  own room for that) and I waited till he left to get dressed, get money  and leave to buy groceries. I was going to leave until he approached me  from behind, said **\"do I not deserve even a good morning? Are you going to ignore me now? I'll  take note\"** I only responded with \"taking into account what happened yesterday it's normal, and you ignored me as well\" and left.\n\nI've  just  brought forward the next therapy session, I cannot live like  this, I don't want to live in this house anymore but I don't have any  other choice nor the money to move out, fuck, I don't even have a job  yet, do you guys have any advice for me? I sometimes question if it's my  fault or if my parents are abusive.\n\n**TL;DR:** Need advice, arguments with father increased, scared and incapable of doing my daily tasks, unconfortable and threatened to get beaten up by father, how can I deal with it without leaving since it's not an option?", "subreddit": "emotionalabuse"}

I'm here because I'm trying to figure out what went down between me and my expartner. I once posted on the breakup sub and one girl told me what I was going through was definitely manipulation. The break up took place back in May so a while back but as you can see, I'm still not moving on. I guess what I want to figure out if my ex is a narc or if I'm just projecting something to explain the situation to myself. So sorry if this is going to be all over the place. It's also going to be tremendously long as I need to, pardon me, word vomit. I will focus on the negative aspects because I remind myself I need to remember this part too, and not only the lovely memories I have of him...\n\nTL; DR: I recently ran into my ex, he reached out then ghosted me. Now I'm trying to figure out whether he might be a narc or was it just an asshole and I'm going crazy.\n\nOnly last week I ran into my ex six months after I've seen him last. He was oh so glad to see me, came over to talk to me. Good thing is I told him I was doing ok and didn't ask him any further questions when he said he was only doing so-so. For all I know he might be upset cause a new girl left him or something and I just really wouldn't want to know that! But still I left the place thinking why would he be upset. Was he doing alright? Were his parents healthy? I just found myself worrying about a person who's decided not to be in my life. He texted me afterwards saying he was really happy to see me and that if I'd ever want to see him, he was there. I've not been in touch with him for six months (I'll get to it later) and thought, that's ok, I will talk to him now. So a couple of days later I wrote him that we responded to that encounter very differently. He became happy, and I became upset. I told him I missed him but wanted to focus on myself, wished him and his family well. I was probably thinking that's when a message like \"sorry, I didn't know you'd be this upset\" or \"my parents are fine/not fine\" or \"I understand\" would come, but no. He just ghosted me. So for the last couple of days I've been tripping about why would he ignore me again. Now, I found Dr Ramani's videos on youtube and there are some things my ex did you could consider narc traits... but the other one's just don't much. He is, for instance, a very generous person and as far as I know has not been by any way abused by his parents (I never got to meet his family though).\n\nTo begin: I met my ex through a flatmate of mine, he would be the guy that hung out a lot in my flatmate's group of friends. He's 11 years older than me, I was sort of the youngest of the group and he the oldest and everyone else was just somewhere in between. I'm entering my 30's and he's almost 40 now. I remember at some point my flatmates would talk a lot about him to me, implying he'd be interested in me but he's never reached out to me personally. The first time we spoke in person he asked me \"how love was going\" which I thought was a rather uncomfortable question to ask (it was to me at the time as I was actually going through a heartache and did not feel like telling a \"stranger\" about it). Anyway we'd hang out more and more and one day he kissed me. He actually suggested we'd go to his and I was like erm, no. But I was also flattered, single and figured eh, what the heck, my friends speak so highly of him. So when a couple of days later we all went out and he asked me if I'd like to go to his I said sure. What I remember made me uncomfortable that night was that his ex lover was there and he'd spend a large chunk of time talking to her while I was talking to his friends. I never wanted to be the girl who's wanting someone's full attention, plus we were not even dating so it's not like a could be jealous.\n\nAnyway, after this things developed rather calmly (which makes me doubt his narcissism as there was not much over the top action going on). Yes, he did lovely things for me, cooked for me, bought me flowers, when I told him I wanted to take things slow as I had been hurt in my previous relationship he said he understood. So there I was, going out with a person who'd understand! I told him I didn't need much from a partner and he said he'd change that, he'd spoil me the way I should be spoiled which was lovely for my self esteem I guess. A couple of months in I told him that I wasn't looking for anything casual, that I wanted a relationship and he said that's what he wanted from me, too so we were now officially together.\n\nWhat I knew is that all of his expartners had cheated on him and left him for another person. I emphatised with it as I've been through some traumatic experiences myself. But we had a totally different view on how a relationship with an ex should look like, I said I was cordial with my exes but didn't really consider them friends, and he was kind of in touch with all of them.\n\nThere were episodes I thought were weird. I remember he went out once and came back with some girl's number, \"for his friend\". He'd end up meeting her a couple of times, sometimes on his own, never with me however. I thought it was hella weird but then again, he was super upfront about it and I thought right, I have male friends too, so...? Things got way worse in the last half of our relationship, he works at a bar and suddenly his mail and phone were just exploding with messages from regulars, always females obviously, which he didn't hide from me but again, I never met any of them and he didn't seem to think they were inappropriate (I remember that one time when he received a mail from a girl asking if he misses her and he just told me she was always so dramatic. Or another time when after work he and his coworker went to some girl's house for shots at 5AM, or that time when I was staying at his for the weekend, he was supposed to work but half an our before leaving for work he said he was actually off that night. And then added that his ex invited him to a bday party so he would go, and he went, without asking me to go with him.)\n\nIt's worth saying all this things happened at the period of time when I was walking on eggshells around him. At about this time last year we had a massive fight. We had been to that thing a week before where his exlover, too, was. I had been very open to him about her making me uncomfortable, I have witnessed them as a couple even if they were nothing serious, I just didn't feel good around her and I was definitely not enjoying being the jealous one. I only asked him to please not leave me feeling uncomfortable. So what happens, we get to that party, she's there, I'm reading a book on my own in another room. Go figure. We get out, I tell him how upset that made me, he apologizes. Next day I find out he texted her the very moment we left the party. Again, don't want to be the crazy one, he reassures me I'm his woman plus tells me that maybe if I'm so afraid of him cheating, it's because I've cheated on him. Anyway, a couple of days pass and we run into his friend who've I only met at that party. We get to some talking, just me and her, she invites me over to go to her party. I say I would love to go, but I won't as I knew the girl who makes me uncomfortable is going to be there and I don't want to kill the mood for anyone. And then she, the woman I've only met tells me that she's seen how inappropriate both of them have behaved that time and that she felt very sorry for me not even knowing me. And that was it for me, realizing that I was not the crazy, jealous one, that other people saw that too. That was it for me and I confronted him about it once again... Unfortunately I was quite drunk at the time so made way more scene than I'd like to but yeah. He tells me that I'm obsessed, crazy, not trusting, and yeah he had noticed that girl was always around him but what should have he done if it was not him seeking her attention. So suddenly we're fighting in the middle of the night, he leaves me there, I get home to an email from him never to speak to him again and give him back his house keys. And to be honest that's what I should have done... \n\nBut no. Instead, I find a therapist to work on my anger issues and jealousy. He doesn't speak to me for three weeks and I'm going crazy (until now, after smaller fights he'd silent treat me for a couple of days but now it's weeks and I'm loosing my mind). Afterwards, he comes back and I'm just there apologizing over and over again for having yelled at him and him \"not understanding what would make me so mad\". But he sticks around. Doesn't want to be with me but calls me every day. Comes over, hangs out, takes care of me. Casually forgets about my birthday but hey, at least we're in touch and maybe he'll forgive me. Until one day, he kisses me and says he'd missed me! I'm so happy that we're getting back together (only to find out later he was just \"checking whether we could get back together or not\"). So we're together but I feel like he's so distant, that if by any chance I will make a mistake, raise my voice, say something makes me uncomfortable, he'll leave again. He uses the \"you're jealous\" card often. Later he even tells me he's not inviting me places because he's not sure I'll know how to act. I have to travel between two cities for work at the time so I'm only in our city for two weeks each month. And suddenly he tells me things like \"it's enough for me if I speak to my partner once a week\", at some point he doesn't want to have sex although when I bring it up the next day the sex goes back to normal. \n\nAnd then he leaves me two days before my master thesis exam. And then he continues to just mail me, call me up as normal, we go on a holiday together, he's lovely as in the beginning and so interested in me and I just don't know... are we together? aren't we? \n\nI cut it about a month later when a friend of mine tells me my \"ex\" who told me \"he wanted to be alone\", \"is probably going to be in a new relationship soon\". \n\nMy ex reached out to me three more times after the break up. Once, all lovey-dovey. When I replied, he ghosted. I once called him and he just asked \"why are you calling me\". So I stopped reaching out. Then two more mails came, one asking me if I still work out (????), the other one telling me \"he's here if I need to talk\". I ignored both of them. But now that I run into him and find myself worrying about him once again, and he ghosts be once again, the person I loved because I thought was so loving, sensitive and caring, I think how much power he still has over me.", "subreddit": "NarcissisticAbuse"}

I don't know if they are a N but the tendencies are there.\n\nThis person genuinely loves their friends, family and pets. Their romantic connections have all been a shitshow. For me this was a relation-shit (Dane Cook). It left me in distress much of the time. My distress didn't seem to show up on the emotional doppler of this person. I had to explain to her that it's strange when you're causing someone distress to not be worried for them. Cough: it's strange to cause someone distress in the first place.\n\nThey do suffer iatrogenic injury and have OCD so that definitely factors into this. Perhaps I can leave some traits here and people might chime in. I just can't be alone with this shit.\n\n**Things that stand out:**\n\nWhen we kissed she would sometimes leave her eyes open. Her eyes almost looked hollow (this might just be me being mean-- so I struggle with this one). But I've never seen anything like it. She was passionate, but I eventually always felt like an object being acted upon. I had to teach her to talk to me like a person in bed. I also felt like she was keeping some kind of sexual score card of how well we were doing together. (I'm getting the willies just writing this out).\n\nI felt like I was being acted upon. She buys me a gift = the gift reminds me of someone else. She make a plan = totally ignoring my chronic illness and major disability.\n\nHer energy was spastic. Like if she stopped she would die. She would take in all the information around her, but move too fast to enjoy a moment together, apart from sex where I felt like an object.\n\nIt takes her way too long to arrive at the right thing. IMO the right thing is *usually* obvious.\n\none of a million examples: I use a walker to walk. I need it. It's not a causal thing-- it's a NEED. She had to **work through** her feelings on this. She is blocked from calling me. A couple days ago (after marinating on it) she tells ME that I should be totally cool with using it. Like I needed permission from her to be okay with something that I need so badly that I don't have the luxury of worrying what anyone thinks about it. WTF?\n\nAt 12am after sex one night she spilled cold water on me. Who does this?\n\n**General Problems:**\n\nListening but not incorporating my truth into her reality. (example: clutching onto motives for things I've done when I've clarified my actions several times. \"You call me more often when you know I'm with my family.\" **FALSE**\n\nIgnoring my boundaries (calling me, sending stuff to my house, following me around online)\n\nIgnoring my boundaries around the relationship dynamic. I have never committed to this person. I never felt safe enough to lock it down. I was constantly CONSTANTLY taunted and guilted over this fact. It was also *totally* ignored at times and she would act like I was committed to her\n\nAsking me if I want to do something 5 times. Having to say no 5 times to the same idea\n\nAsking repeatedly to get off the phone when I wasn't feeling well\n\nGuilt tripping (Endlessly. As if guilt was going out of style)\n\nWhen I tried to leave she would: word salad (jut into other topics with no relation to the main topic... almost like her brain was misfiring and I really believe it may have been : ( She would also regress into a child-like state when I mentioned breaking it off. She has on several occasions lied to me to a pathological level to emotional maim me for trying to leave.\n\nAccusing me of lording control over the entire relationship when I have only ever tried to honor my limitations as a disabled person\n\nNo appreciation for space or ending things = a show of respect for the wellbeing of both parties\n\nI never felt safe receiving anything from her. I always felt like there was quid pro quo\n\nShe spoke in belittlements and constant sarcasm and then play it off like that's just how her people talk (To be fair, it is)\n\nShe would speak down to me with total conviction in a moment where I was at peace or being playful. Pulling the legs out from under me.\n\nHer OCD made me afraid of things I don't want to be afraid of\n\nHer sense of empathy is not easily readable. Like astoundingly buried\n\nAfter I've ended things she speaks to me with a disproportionate sense of love to the situation. Or acts like this great romance has ended when we've spent half the time fighting. \n\n\\-------------\n\nA year of my life banging my head against a wall. I was life-threateningly sick to begin with. Hoping this person could change and trying to edit who they are just made me feel like the bad guy. There's genuinely something really troubled here.

But, i need to understand it and get feedback from others. If there are any questions, I\u2019m happy to answer.\n\nI\u2019m 19, I\u2019ve been homeschooled my whole life and my parents are devout Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses (for those who don\u2019t know - you can find information in r/exjw). My early childhood happy, but I was a very lonely and isolated child, even with other children in the Jws. At age 12 i was doing some dangerous things on the internet. i assumed family love was something inherent, but i felt empty, so clearly what i was missing was sexual affection. The dangerousness of that thought is obvious. \n\nAt age 15 i ran away from home to my grandmother\u2019s. I was self-harming (biting and hitting myself) and my mental state was deteriorating. A lot happened - it\u2019s almost a post in of itself, *however* the end result was: \n1. I was manipulated into going home (i was promised everything was going to better, and that the real problem was that i was chronically sick)\n2. I was diagnosed with a chronic autoimmune disease my parents blamed for every single negative feeling i had.\n3. I was never allowed to talk to my grandmother again. I\u2019ve been sat down numerous times for them to tell me she never loved me, only helped me to \u201cget back at\u201d my mother for a vague reason i still don\u2019t understand.\n4. Counselling i received while i was gone was immediately stopped after i came home. I have since gotten in trouble for asking to get counselling. \n5. I went 3 years without wifi. When i finally asked for it back my parents acted very confused as to why i wanted it at all.\n6. My parents cornered me about things on my phone they had gone through when i gave them my phone to get a new texting plan on.\n\nIn the current times, i am suicidal, self harming, and have constant panic attacks. I both don\u2019t want to be a JW and i\u2019m a non-binary gay. Both of those things I dread having to confront with my parents. It took me a year to do want i want on the internet and outside home, and i still get severe anxiety about eating things they wouldn\u2019t approve, watch things they wouldn\u2019t approve, and talking to people about my home life feelings. I can\u2019t get counselling - because any whisper that their parenting might be lacking sets them off on how i need to be more grateful, other people have it way worse than me, they deserve help and respect from me. \n\n I don\u2019t do anything on social media or on non-incognito browsers that i think they wouldn\u2019t like because i\u2019m scared of how they\u2019ll react. \n\nOutside of special cases, i am not allowed to have friends outside of the religion. \n\nI often feel like they have little to no sympathy for my emotions or how i feel. They\u2019ll often scoff at me for being overdramatic or being too in my head - like i just should get over it.\n\nIts hard for me to define any of this because i often go into denial, and it is cripplingly stressful to think anything other than everything is fine. They never say anything outright that name-calls or shames and they always have a polite and caring upfront persona, so its impossible to say \u201cthey said this and it was a obviously bad thing to say.\u201d\n\nI\u2019ve been working towards moving out, but it is a hard process and sends me into suicidal lapses every once and awhile.

Well, that\u2019s when he decides to come around. \n\nDuring our year long relationship, there were so many red flags. He has a kid from a previous marriage and me not having any kids at the time, didn\u2019t understand what he was doing. He often flirted with girls and his exes. He had a thing with keeping his past flings around. We got into plenty of arguments because I was catching on. \n\nOn top of being a narcissist, he is also an alcoholic. During the last month of our relationship, he managed to total his car from being drunk and then got a DUI two weeks later. The deal breaker was me catching him talking to another girl one night after a concert and I threw him out of my house. I was a little more than 7 months pregnant. The girl he was talking to was someone he claimed \u201clooked too much like a guy to find attractive\u201d, but there he was.\n\nSo, after the breakup, we didn\u2019t talk. I had my son a month early from the stress of having to move and the whole ordeal. He was healthy. My nex wasn\u2019t there for the delivery because I didn\u2019t want him to be and he later found out where I was, then showed up. \n\nAfterwards, we tried working out a visitation schedule, but it never worked. He was always \u201csick\u201d (aka hungover) or didn\u2019t have money to go visit because he didn\u2019t have a car or license. It got to a point where he texted me about giving up his rights because he didn\u2019t want to go to court for a custody order. So I filed paperwork to take everything away in regards to custody, like he asked, and he posted the paperwork online to have people bash me. \n\nAfter the post, he never responded to the paperwork to get custody. Months later, he is telling people i took his son away when he was just trying to be a good dad, so i put him on child support since he claimed these things. Once the application went in and he was notified, he called me. 5 months of no contact and he Claimed it was too much money to file a response and then wanted to be in my sons life. I agreed.\n\nWe tried a schedule, but of course, he went back to his ways. I never changed the agreement and I told him that when he\u2019s ready, he can file the paperwork. That was October 5th. Our court date was on Halloween for Child Support and he never said anything to me until a few days later.\n\nHe text me telling me off and what not. I just responded with short answers, but that made him more mad. He called me every name in the book. Now that support is being garnished, he\u2019s even more pissed. \n\nI\u2019ve started therapy to help with healing in the beginning of October and it has helped a lot. It\u2019s normal to be angry, but I always tell myself that he is not happy and the girl he\u2019s with (the one he cheated with) is just another supply because he\u2019s cheated on her, but publicly. \n\nThere are still some things I have a hard time with like my son not having his dad and the guilt of giving my son the dad I did because I was too blinded by his ways to notice he was a crap parent, but it\u2019s getting better. I wish things could be civil, but they just can\u2019t. \n\nSorry for the long post/rant. Thanks for reading.", "subreddit": "NarcissisticAbuse"}

Think about that. The person we fell for and had so much fun with was fake. And it\u2019s made worse by us keeping those memories in our heads, because we keep pushing those memories onto them and keeping up their fakeness for them. \n\n\u201cYeah, they cheated, gaslighted, and triangulated me, but what if they come back as who they were and I can be happy ever after again?

I sometimes think to myself... What if I was that stereotypical bitchy girlfriend when we first got together... Would he still treat me like this?  \n\nI use to think that my ability to not let others get to me was one of my biggest strengths.  I remember in 8th grade a bully had me cornered my back against that wall. A group of kids surrounding us.  I decided then I wasn't going to give her a reaction. So I didn't.  I stood there looking at her. At one point I thought how ridiculous she looked and I smiled. That was the moment a teacher broke it up.  He pulled me a side and told me how proud he was of me for not giving in.  \nThe following year in High School that bully and others she recruited took it a step farther.  I had a friend with me who was very small for her age.  She was 15 but looked 6.  We found out later a tumor in her brain stunted her growth.  She was with me when The bullies found me.  They took us down an ally way.  Told me If I fought back they would hurt her.  Out numbered by 5 to 1. I knew I had no chance at fighting my way out. I let them beat me up.  Everytime they kicked my legs and I fell I stood back up. When they bashed my head against a tree I didn't cry.  \nThis same attitude served me well when I became a security gaurd for new student housing on the university campus. Young and dumb college kids  with liquid courage looking for fun could never ruffle my feathers as much as they tried.  \nThis personality trait was what my Husband (Narc) was what first attracted me to him.  I know now he saw it as an opportunity and not a strength.  \nWhat I once was so proud of I feel now is just a curse.  I didn't let him get to me.  I thought to myself that he was more sensitive then most guys so I would let him take his emotions and stress out on me because I knew I could handle it.  As the years have gone by I realized that he wasn't just sensitive that he was a narc.  that he had used my greatest strength as a weapon against me.  \nI sometimes wish I could be different.

I'm not concerned in the least what or when or how she drinks, just not here around me.\n\nThen she's home and her friend is there and she's quiet and huffy and puffy, and angry expression on her face. I eventually texted her (not no make her friend feel awkward) and said she can drink as long as she can promise nothing bad will happen.\n\nNothing did so that's good.\n\nBut I asked her the next day if we could talk about her statement. She just asked \"Why?\". I said because I don't feel good about something that was said. She sighs, rolls her eyes, angry expression, and gestures a motion as if to say \"shoo\" and said I was being controlling by not letting her drink.\n\nRemember that compromise? I asked her if we could talk about it eventually. She said she doesn't know/can't tell me. \n\nI told her that if that compromise doesn't work for her, then I would like it if we could come up with a different compromise that works for us both.\n\nShe said I'm just trying to make her talk when she doesn't want to. And then got quiet and refused to talk to me, saying there's too much going on in her head because of when I lost my temper and some other stuff.\n\nI told her I'm going to be seeking therapy. That I wonder if I have BPD. She rolled her eyes, interrupted abruptly, and said in a semi-angry tone \"with narcissistic tendencies\".\n\nShe said that I lack empathy and that I don't apologise enough or when I should, saying the other day was the only time I've apologized to her first. And I swear I remember those times differently, I swear there's many many times I've apologized first, but now I'm doubting whether that's true or if I'm remembering correctly.\n\nI'm in doubt right now about writing this because maybe I'm just doing this for attention because I'm the narcissist. I never really want to talk about it.\n\nShe specifically asked me to take a test on narcissism multiple times throughout our relationship. I test mid/average and she asks me if I trust the results or not. And I have no idea if I do or not. Did I score mid/average because I know how to fool the test? It feels like she wants me to think that because she doesn't seem happy about it if I imply that I don't think so. It's not neutral.\n\nI currently feel like I'm incapable of stable or healthy relationships and like a monster and broken person.\n\nI'm not talking to her much today/yesterday and I feel like I'm doing something wrong by doing that.", "subreddit": "NarcissisticAbuse"}

Sort of just casually not really thinking anything\nShe didn\u2019t answer which really got me curious and then eventually just sent me a GIF of a wrapped present, a GIF of Santa and a GIF of Christmas related decorations\n\nSo I just thought oh someone got her a girl nice and casually but also curiously asked who it\u2019s from\n\nTo which she refused to answer like she just changed the subject I started getting bothered at this point thinking wth why is she being so funny about this\nSo I asked a few more times, among them she laughed and said \u201cwhy are you so worked up about it?\u201d \nThen I said (stupidly and I know it\u2019s wrong) \u201cOkay whatever I\u2019ll assume the worst and throw them out - fuck you\u201d \n\nThen she shouts \u201cI bought them myself!

Literally, the cocktail dress was exquisite. I wasn't very confident when I showed up, but somehow I managed to walk gracefully and it was only when I hugged people that I realized my arms were shaking. Someone gave me a drink and my nerves got better after that. But it was during the initial exchanges that I realized how little everyone knew about my Nex and I. My friends purposefully put me at a table on the OPPOSITE side of the venue and kept up a physical shield of their own bodies throughout the night as he kept trying to get close to me. We didn't talk. I ignored his new love supply. Eventually, I got so many drinks in me I wasn't even aware of where he was, I was having too much fun. It was really good. So many people that remembered me said they hadn't seen me in forever, it was eye opening, I was *remembered*. So many people hugged me and I've been affection starved for months, touched only when he was trying to pressure me into intimacy and I kept refusing. It was so uplifting to be touched just for a hug, to have people tell me I looked so good in my dress and my friends to tell me it's the happiest they've seen me in forever.\n\nThere was an after party at a bar where I apparently had too many drinks in too short a time, plus no food. I got to learn there genuinely ARE good people out there because between my friend and my Nex's boss, I ended up in good hands until I sobered enough to change into another set of clothes and was tucked into a guest bed at his boss' house. I woke up to being babied with water, medicine, sprite, a steam cleaned dress, bland breakfast for my stomach, patience and reassurance I didn't do *anything bad* and that I was probably one of the most polite drunks they've ever seen.\n\nI didn't sleep back at my shared living space with my Nex on Sunday, choosing to recover at another couple's home. Monday when I made it back I realized he had retaliated by taking the vehicle so I couldn't use it. He later sent me a message that night apologizing if it seemed like he was being 'hostile' and 'retaliating' by taking the car, he 'just wanted to explain' that he wasn't being malicious... etc, etc, and then he shared an album of travel pictures with me, which I haven't accepted.\n\nI don't get why he's lying to people about breaking up with me while being with a new person, hiding it from his peers, and why he still has us together on FB, which I found out after the party, because I stopped using it way before all this. Some people told me he's keeping me as a backup supply, but I just don't get anything anymore. Why he kept trying to engage with me at the party and such.", "subreddit": "NarcissisticAbuse"}

Finally ended things with N fianc\u00e9e and today he is moving out and I\u2019m feeling really confused / not as strong in my decision", "author": "tokyojuniper", "self_text": "Hello! I recently broke off an engagement with a narcissist and I\u2019ve been really strong and able to maintain my decision making but today am feeling very wavering in my boundaries and decisions. \n\nThis is very long and I\u2019m very sorry there\u2019s just so much. \n\nTW: sexual assault / suicide attempt\n\nSome background, we met and started dating about 15mos ago and became engaged this May. I was caught off guard by the engagement because he had insisted he never wanted to marry anyone or have children and although we had plans to move in together and were talking about life partnership the engagement came somewhat out of the blue. Our relationship was very strong at the time, however, and I happily accepted. \n\nAfter we moved in together things were great. He was loving, supportive, helpful around the house etc for the first two months. After that, however, he started getting a lot more antagonistic towards me and suddenly stopped providing the love and support and partnership he had been giving and began communicating with me in an unhealthy fashion (namely getting drunk and high-volume arguing with me about anything at all). I\u2019m very sensitive to men yelling from past abuse and am very forthcoming about that to partners and kept articulating my concern for the dynamic and that it isn\u2019t something that I will be a part of and that I needed it to change. All of this coincided with a lot of other red flag behavior like financial dependency on me when he was supposedly making more money than me, name calling / otherwise malicious comments, and total inattentiveness as a partner while bragging grandly to friends and acquaintances about everything he does for me. \n\nA few weeks ago he went through my phone while I was asleep and read messages between myself and some close friends about his behavior and discarded me immediately but in the discarding kept saying \u201c*I* don\u2019t want to do this it\u2019s because *you* want to end things\u201d and stonewalled when I tried to get any deeper with it. It was so callous that it shut my heart off from him and I was totally fine with us ending it. \n\nBut then the next day he said he didn\u2019t recall breaking up but if that\u2019s what I want is to give up on our partnership then okay. I told him he wasn\u2019t going to gaslight me into believing a full on conversation I was a part of yesterday didn\u2019t happen and he told me that I\u2019m the one gaslighting him and that it\u2019s really fucked up for me to pretend like I\u2019m being gaslit when that\u2019s something that actually happens to others. But I still held firm in my boundaries. \n\n4 days later he came into the guest room where I\u2019ve been staying and wanted to talk and did so by getting into the bed only in boxers and then proceeded to tell me that every issue I\u2019ve been raising with him about his behavior is actually things that I am doing to him (No, YOUre the one who yells at ME etc) and how hurt he was by my treatment of him and that he expected it because I\u2019ve done it before in relationships (I suppose referencing other abusive relationships I\u2019ve been in? Not nice at all) and also peppered in some name calling (I was in the ICU for a week last month after having a nervous breakdown and overdosing while he and I were in a terrible place and a lot of other stressers in my life were happening and was in psychosis for days and he kept the information from my friends and family even though I came very close to death and when I brought up that that was troubling to me he said I was a \u201cbed pissing lunatic\u201d when I was there). By the end of the conversation I was so mixed up I couldn\u2019t think straight and was trying to run my mind over every conversation to find what he was talking about in regards to my toxic behavior but when I asked him for any details at all of what I\u2019d said and where and when it was \u201cI don\u2019t remember\u201d.\n\nConversation ended with him asking if he could kiss me and I said yes because ?????? And instead of kissing me he pulled up the dress I was wearing and started going down on me and I didn\u2019t stop it and was still so confused and it turned into this weird sex that I didn\u2019t understand and then without asking or saying anything he finished inside of me knowing I am not on birth control which is not something we have ever done without explicit consent and protection in some other way. \n\nBut I ended up keeping my boundaries and insisting that this was over and he needed to move out. Today he is moving out and something about seeing all of his things packed up in this house we moved into together and him taking his dog and just all of it is so sad it\u2019s the first time in this that I\u2019ve felt real heartbreak and this morning when I was heading to work he stopped me and said he didn\u2019t want this and I said I didn\u2019t either but I didn\u2019t have another option and he said he\u2019s going to find a therapist today and get into therapy and work on himself and he\u2019s sorry he hasn\u2019t been better and wants this so badly and loves me so much and now I\u2019m all mixed up. \n\nIs it possible for him to get therapy and be straightened out and be able to be in a healthy partnership? Is this just another false promise preying on my sensitivity? Should I even entertain the possibility of reconciling this down the road??? Am I stupid for being this confused? I\u2019m so confused and so sad and so exhausted by this process and he has been so hurtful but then always followed it up with sad eyes and saying he loves me so much and doesn\u2019t want me to leave. I feel like my ability to differentiate between love and hurtfulness is getting really weak and tonight I don\u2019t know if I can maintain my boundaries and I\u2019m nervous to even go home because I\u2019m so delicate and prone to changing my mind right now after all of this intense back and forth. I feel stupid because if someone else was asking me this about their partner I would tell them to stay the course and cut them out of their life because that person, as a narcissist, doesn\u2019t have the tools or insight to be capable of that kind of change but actually being in this position it feels way muddier than that.", "subreddit": "NarcissisticAbuse"}

Took me on expensive trips before marriage. I thought it was too good to be true. \n\n- has grand idea of life and what it should consist of. \n\n- says I should be a mind reader. Gets angry when he says one thing, but has an edge on it that I get confused but listen to what he says but tells me that was the wrong thing to do.

He mentioned that she has a new puppy so when I saw dog related items I asked if it was a good gift, he said no a few times until I came across a self heating dog bed. He said wow that\u2019s a really good idea OP and asked me to order it. It came yesterday and looked quite sad and flimsy. I started laughing and said that\u2019s not what I expected. I showed my mom the gift and she started laughing because she thought that someone had got my SO the gift. He got annoyed and said it\u2019s shit and that it\u2019s my fault as he only bought it because I said to get it. I was annoyed because he chose this out of multiple options I gave him and was only trying to help because he was struggling to find something. I thought it was dealt with but when we went upstairs we were messing around and he said again how shit the present was and that it was my fault. I thought he was joking around so I jokingly said it wasn\u2019t my fault again. He then slapped my face, I was stunned and pushed him away. It wasn\u2019t painful and I would\u2019ve shrugged it off as play fighting but he said \u201csorry you were annoying me\u201d. I couldn\u2019t believe that he just told me that he intentionally slapped me BECAUSE I\u2019d annoyed him. \n\nHe apologised straight away, he said he doesn\u2019t know why he did it but that he was extremely upset because he felt everyone was laughing at him because of his gift and lashed out. I said we were laughing with him not at him and that I was just trying to lighten the mood, he has autism and sometimes misunderstands social interactions but I didn\u2019t believe that was a reason to slap me. We went to bed and he asked me to slap him back to make it fair because he felt awful, I said I\u2019m not going to do that and that I was uncomfortable sleeping with him so he said he\u2019ll sleep on the sofa.

He is usually wonderful and has never laid hands on me before, I had just come out of a physically and emotionally abusive 2 year relationship when I met him and he knows this so despite feeling minor I worry it\u2019s going to happen again. \n\nI googled experiences of people being slapped by their partners and came across a list of signs of an abusive relationship and was horrified he fit around 5/15 things scaring me more. When he came home from work he apologised and explained he didn\u2019t mean it and can\u2019t understand why he did it, he also apologised for asking me to slap him in return as he said he realises this may have seemed manipulative. I said I\u2019m not sure I can continue the relationship.  He said that he feels he may have underlying anger issues and would try to seek therapy but told me he\u2019ll move out after Christmas and understands my decision.\n\nI feel confused because part of me feels like I\u2019m overreacting and it was a genuine mistake and not really abuse.

{"post_id": "e9gumx", "created_utc": 1576115040, "title": "Just Need to Get This Off My Chest", "author": "SuperiorSperg", "self_text": "My mother was an addict, so from five to eighteen, I was raised as a foster child by my aunt and her family, who adopted my when I was eight. My aunt was my mother's sister, and already had three kids, my adopted brothers. From ages five to thirteen my aunt was incredibly abusive. I recently started seeing a therapist to unpack some of the issues I have as a result, and we've gotten into some of the specifics of what my mom did. For a long time, forever, really, it was hard for me to conceptualize it as abuse because I was conditioned to think that I was overreacting, that it was my fault, etc. It was so normal to me that I didn't even think about a lot of it. As an adult, I mostly block it out. My therapist was in shock when I told her some of the stuff that happened and told me that my aunt was basically systematically torturing me. Every time it comes up, she will gently correct \"abused\" to \"tortured.\" So I guess the point of this post is to help me decompress from that and get this stuff off my chest, and, I guess, hear a third-party perception of what happened, because even now I don't know if it was \"that bad,\" you know?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo here are some highlights from my childhood:\n\n\\-Physical abuse: From a young age she would beat me with a wooden spoon and hit me with her hands, spoons, whatever was around. As I got older she transitioned more into just paddling, with a spoon, books, and a wooden cutting board with a handle, to avoid leaving marks. When I was younger (under nine, maybe) I often had bruises, but as I got older actual marks were rarer. She did make me bleed on occasion (I have a scar on my wrist from when she hit me hard enough with a wooden paddle to make the skin split open, she gave me a gash on my head, etc.)\n\n\\-Verbal abuse: She would yell and berate me constantly. She swore at me and screamed at me from the age of five onward that I was nothing, that no one would save me, that my mom didn't want me, that no one cared about me, that I was evil and selfish, that I was a dumb fuck, stuff like that.\n\n\\-Isolation: She singled me out--she had three other children, but I was the only one who was punished like this. She said it was because I was a bad kid (that I was sneaky/dishonest/selfish). I was extremely isolated; when I was in trouble/\"on the shit list\" (often for something as small as mishearing her or being annoying) I was not to look at or talk to my siblings, and I would get in trouble for not \"acting the part.\" My brothers were raised to believe I was lesser and that I was \"bad.\" They would often participate in my abuse and get me in trouble for their amusement. I was also homeschooled, so I did not have an outlet anywhere.\n\n\\-Overeating: This is a weird one, but my aunt has serious food issues and used to be sort of anorexic. Her thing was that she was going to get me fat. So she would mix up things for me to eat that tasted bad, like forcing me to eat an entire bowl of straight mayonnaise, or a package of cream cheese. She made me eat a pinecone once. This was the most common punishment. She basically wanted to make sure I was always suffering without having to be there to administer the punishment. Often I was locked in my room for long periods of time, but NEVER just left alone, I was always eating something awful that she had concocted. Often she would force me to eat until I vomited, and then force me to eat my own vomit in front of her.\n\n\\-Exercise: Another weird one, but also very common, she would force me to exercise for long periods of time, sometimes until I collapsed. Generally she would force me to do jumping jacks for 10 minutes straight, but would add more time if I was too loud. Sometimes she would have me run or hop from one end of the house to the other.\n\n\\-Exposure: I would be locked in the garage to do chores without shoes for hours at a time most days, and locked outside for hours every morning without a coat (regardless of the weather), usually in my pajamas, to walk the dog around the yard or pick up trash. She once made me go for a hike for miles in the snow with no coat and I got hypothermia.\n\n\\-Sleep Deprivation: I was often not allowed to sleep. I would be locked in the garage overnight to do chores, or told to sit on the floor and eat whatever she had made me all night. She would check on me to make sure I didn't fall asleep. I also, from the age of six or so, had to wake up at 8:00 am everyday for chores, regardless of when I went to bed, without an alarm clock.\n\n\\-Control: Every single aspect of my life was controlled. I was not allowed to play during the week, and was either in trouble, doing chores, or doing homework. When I finished my chores I was to ask for something else to do. I guess what I'm trying to say is that it was systematic. It never ended, like I didn't just get beat in rage and it was over. There was a structure to it. One slight meant I was in trouble for days. I was always watched. I was a second class person.\n\n\\-HUMILIATION: This was the biggest one and the hardest to talk about so I won't get into it that much. My aunt was huge into humiliation. She would come up with games for me to play so she and my brothers could make fun of me. They would all gather around while I played them or exercised or whatever and hit me, trip me, make fun of me, and everyone, my whole family, would laugh at me while I sobbed. She would not allow me to go the bathroom for long periods, sometimes until I wet myself. She would make me wear silly outfits, force me to be naked (I once couldn't find my bathing suit and when a girl from our neighborhood came over for a play date, she forced me to be naked the entire time, she predictably did not return), things like that. I was constantly degraded for sport. This is too hard to talk about so I will stop there, but humiliation and degradation were huge, defining features of my childhood.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThat's most of it. I don't really know what I'm trying to accomplish. A lot of this is coming up for the first time in years, and I guess I just needed to vent. The rest of my family has moved on from this, and we don't talk about it. When it has come up my aunt just says I got what I deserved. It just feels unfair that I have to live with this, alone, while they don't even think about it.\n\nThank you for reading, if you got this far.", "subreddit": "survivorsofabuse"}

Daisy and I knew that letting Brenda move in wasn't the best idea as she was much more of a \"small doses\" friend, but she had nowhere else to go.\n\nRight after Brenda moved in, something happened in her personal life which, when combined with some other stresses, caused a massive breakdown. Daisy and I helped her though it, talking her through panic attacks and vomiting episodes and sitting with her until she fell asleep a couple of nights in a row. After this, our relationship pretty much deteriorated. I knew she was going through a tough time so I didn't want to bring up any of these things to her as each incident felt too small to make a fuss over.\n\nShe is often upset with me over small things, and she's said some pretty hurtful things like \"I wouldn't have done what you did to my worst enemy\" and \"I took that as an indication of how you felt about our friendship and wanted to give you space to think.\" I basically have to admit I'm in the wrong so that the tension in the apartment dissolves.\n\nIt got even worse about 2 months ago. Every time Daisy walked into the room, Brenda would say \"get out. go away. I don't want to see you.\" If Daisy spoke, Brenda would say \"shut up. shut up I don't want to hear you speak be quiet.\" Sometimes she would say \"I'm going to beat you up\" or \"I'm going to kill you,\" which at first seemed to be the nature of their relationship: teasingly mean. Eventually it started to get to Daisy, and she asked Brenda to stop as it made her uncomfortable, to which Brenda replied \"I'm clearly joking! You know I don't mean it I've never said it seriously.\" She didn't really stop afterwards.\n\nShe constantly has breakdowns and cries in our living room until one of us comforts her. She constantly asks for validation and attention ( I don't believe that friendship should transactional at all) but I truly get nothing in return and constantly having to ease her breakdowns is exhausting, but I feel awful just letting her cry. \n\nUntil recently I never would have called it abusive. My boyfriend sent me an article about abusive friendship and I had basically said everything in it word for word about Brenda. I think the part that stuck out to me most was\n\n&gt;\"If you do want to speak out about your dynamics, you don\u2019t feel safe. You feel like it might make it worse \u2014 you\u2019re concerned that trying to speak honestly will motivate further victim blaming or gaslighting, and you can\u2019t imagine it will be productive. You feel like they won\u2019t take you seriously, or they won\u2019t make an effort to understand. You fear it will leave you feeling worse, that you will have to make it up to them. You refrain to protect yourself.\"\n\nI had basically expressed that sentiment word for word the day before over another situation that Brenda was upset with me about.\n\nUltimately, Brenda was my friend and I don't want to lose her even though I know what she's doing is hurting me. I know I haven't been the perfect friend and Brenda deserves to be mad at me sometimes, but I think she handles it really poorly and never tells me when she's upset so we can talk it out. There's obviously times where I'm in the wrong but it just feels like there's no healthy way to resolve these issues with her. I'm scared of confronting her when she's mad at me since she is very good at twisting things to her advantage and I'm not sure how far she would go (getting me or Daisy in trouble with the university, the apartment complex, etc), but when things aren't bad I'm scared of stirring the pot again because the apartment is really unbearable to be in when she's upset. \n\nSo here's the biggest issue: moving isn't in the cards for us. There's no way for us to kick Brenda out as all of us are on an individual lease for each bed in the apartment. The apartment complex isn't university housing, but it was designed for university students so the only way for us to get out is to move within the building, but there's no availability. There's no way to break the lease unless we sign it to someone else, but neither Daisy nor I can afford other housing options. How can I stay in this living situation without being completely miserable until my lease runs out? How can I stand up for Daisy because I know she's getting it worse when I can't even stand up for myself? I'm really at a loss on how to handle this whole situation. It's kind of the first thing I've really had to deal with as an adult with no other adults to help me. Any advice would be appreciated.", "subreddit": "emotionalabuse"}

I\u2019ve endured this for 4 years, although the first year was the honeymoon phase. I didn\u2019t understand how the relationship could end at the drop of a hat. Gone. All because I wanted an apology from him. No remorse. Just laughed at me and said I was the dumb naked bitch on the bed and if I didn\u2019t like it, then I should leave.  And that he was going to sleep like a baby and could careless if I left. So I left. And it hurts immensely but I\u2019m sitting in my new apartment 10 days later. \n\n\n\u201cIt is ok to be hurt. It is ok to breakdown and cry. You are well within your rights to feel everything you are feeling right now as a woman and a human and as someone who has invested your time , family, money, and heart into this relationship. Do not feel sorry for feeling any emotion you have. Feel everything. Feel it, have your cry, and then be productive. That cycle will continue. Then you will notice that your breakdowns will become less and your crying won\u2019t be as much. Give yourself time. \n\nWhat\u2019s not ok is to give up on yourself. You are going through a big transition right now and everything is going to feel different because your decisions are going to be based on you and no longer do you have to take into consideration anyone else\u2019s feelings or well-being other than Natalies. \n\nWhen you go through losing someone, You will find yourself being sad about all the good times you had when things were good. But you won\u2019t be thinking about what happens when the times were bad. You should never be with someone and feel like you can\u2019t speak your mind or truth, your feelings, emotions, or second guess any natural action because you don\u2019t want to anger  someone else. That is not healthy. No one can say they \u201clove\u201d you and throw things (no matter how big or small the object), call them you of your name in any situation, kick you when you\u2019re already down or say anything to you disrespectful. And the most bitchass thing he can do is disrespect you, physically emotionally mentally or verbally violate you while you are vulnerable (while standing in front of him naked). You didn\u2019t want to have sex with him and he violated you in all those ways. That\u2019s not ok. Ever. \n\nDon\u2019t go back and think, \u201cwell if I just had sex with him then this wouldn\u2019t have happened\u201d. Because if you could have brought yourself to have sex with him when you didn\u2019t want to, then you would have. You may not remember exactly what you were thinking/feeling in that exact moment a week or two down the line...but know that if you would have been up to having sex with him, then you would have AND this situation STILL would have happened later down the line just on another day of the week. \n\nFor him to see you sad and hurt and to laugh at you while you pack, call you out of your name, insinuate or hint that no one will want you or to deal with you child as if your a burden and not a human being is more of a reason to fucking leave. \n\nHe should be treating you and \u201cN\u201d with the most respect. He should be protecting you as a man. He can protect random strangers and put his life on the line for random strangers in the community but can\u2019t protect the women he calls his family? In his own home? He\u2019s a punk ass bitch for that shit. And for everything else. \n\nYou deserve respect. You deserve to be happy. Nothing you have done is wrong. You could have called him every name in the book, cheated on him, ignored him...yelled at him. Whatever. But none of that is grounds for him to kick you while your down. None of it is grounds for him to treat you that way. You do not deserve to feel like you can\u2019t be yourself in your own home.  Like you can\u2019t say what\u2019s on your heart and mind in your own home. A home that should be a sanctuary for you.  \n\nThe cycle would have kept going. It\u2019s not healthy. Treating you like shit and abusing you, then saying I\u2019m sorry is not healthy. You hang on the small good things for verification that things are going to get better. That confirmation bias is shattered when things get bad again. That\u2019s not healthy. That\u2019s not ok. \n\nYou have shown growth by even acknowledging that a factor in your guys dysfunction is alcohol. You are going in the right direction. You will have many emotions. Feel them, just don\u2019t live in them. You will get through this. Let people help you. \n\nYou are going to be sad. You are going to cry. You are going to feel like you don\u2019t want to get out of bed. You are going to want to give up some days. That\u2019s ok. You deserve to feel that way. Just don\u2019t live in it and make it who you are. Don\u2019t let it stop you. You have someone watching your every move. She is going to see what you are going through and see what you are feeling. She may even feel some of it. But she is also going to see that you are handling your shit and not giving up. You are low right now but there is no limit to how high you can go from here. You got this. Just don\u2019t forget you are human. People will say that \u201coh you\u2019ll get over it, it will pass, you\u2019ll be fine\u201d. That shit doesn\u2019t help. That shit means nothing. It makes you feel like you don\u2019t have the right to feel what you are feeling. and that\u2019s not true. You feel it. Just don\u2019t let it become who you are. You will win this. Maybe not now, or tomorrow, or next week. But you will win this. And you will do it by finding happiness in yourself and with \u201cN\u201d . Not through a man.

(There were a lot of other issues. this is just the one that is still getting to me) he pressured me into getting physical before I was ready and our relationship after that kind of resolved around sex although I didnt see it at the time.

He let me into his insecurities and I considered him a best friend and loved him.\n\nHowever I noticed the past month, he was a bit offish, but he was like this with ALL of his friends. \n\nWhat I had learnt from my break up, is NOT to chase anybody. And he was lieing about his whereabouts, and so on. But I was not saying anything, and just getting on with my life. He even organized a night out together with friends, and was doing the silent treatment to everybody. I didn't let it phase me. I asked someone what time and where we were meeting, and headed down to the bar with our mutual friends. \n\nUsually I would chase him \"have i done something to offend you? whats wrong?\" but he was like this with everybody. And rather than be insecure and chase I let him do his usual routine, as he was doing it with everybody.\n\nTo cut a long story short, he was fine with everyone, we had a laugh, all together, drinking and so on. For me it was a very important evening. I had not gone out much since my split, and it was nice to drink, dance, and let my hair down. I was thinking \"its great to just let loose.\"\n\nWe were leaving the venue early hours of the morning, and my godbro asked me to come back in a cab with him. As we were leaving, some girls were outside and he built up the courage to speak to them. I just sat alongside the girls laughing, joking, not offending or doing anything. Feeling comfortable and happy as myself. He pulled a face and said \"cabs here...\" and had a stern look on his face.\n\nThe second I got into the cab, he let loose at me;\n\n\"I hate the way you talk to girls and women. Its dreadful. You are not coming across well or cool.\" - bear in mind I have been in a relationship four years, he hasn't.\n\n\"You are overweight. Look at yourself.\" - he weighs more than me, and is bigger than me.\n\n\"You are a loser in the way you carry yourself.\" - I was the happiest I had felt in months.\n\n\"You dont wake up early.\" - He wakes up 6am to train in the gym. I wake up 7am. But ok.\n\n\"You havent amounted to anything in your life.\" - I am self made, he has had everything handed to him on a silver platter.\nThen more personal attacks on my looks, etc. He also through a very personal thing back in my face which I confided in him about and he knew it hurt me.\n\nLets make something clear, I have NEVER EVER insulted him or his family. I idolize them, and look up to them all as inspiration. His dad was self made.\n\nI also didnt ever respond back with insults, I remained silent. \n\nHe claimed \"I AM TELLING YOU THIS BECAUSE I LOVE AND CARE ABOUT YOU.\"\n\nWith tears in my eyes I simply said \"how long have you been feeling like this?\"\n\nHe said \"for a number of years.\"\n\nThe cab pulled up to a red light and I walked out of the car in the rain to catch a train. I couldnt take anymore.\n\nI was balling my eyes out, my heart broken. I was texting him exactly what I had felt for years \"I am obviously NOT good enough for your company.\"\n\nHe replied \"you are blowing things out of proportion.\"\n\nI said \"you think I am a loser, cant talk to women, overweight.\"\n\nHe replied \"so you agree? DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT.\"\n\nI then proceeded to suggest \"I have always felt that you looked down on me. I am glad to have that confirmed. I will never stop respecting or loving your family however.\" \n\nHe replied \"call me tomorrow\"\n\nI said \"no. I have no reason to. Sorry.\"\n\nHim \"oh you have blown this out of proportion!\"\n\nI then sent more messages saying how much i loved him, and how heartbroken I was with what was said. But with my experience with my nex, it was the lowest I had felt. And I had no choice but to cut contact.\n\nHe eventually TWO DAYS later decided to text me saying \"i had work issues, I was drunk I shouldnt have lashed out on you. But there IS elements of truth to what I said.\" \n\nI can only interpret his apology as backhanded. And my family like myself are disgusted by his behaviour.\n\nI have no choice but to completely distance myself, and no longer speak to him again.\n\nI feel lied to, abused and utterly dreadful. My family are in utter shock.\n\nTo have two narcissistic abusive people my ex and my godbro both in the space of months do what they have to me, have just taken me over the edge.\n\nBut im staying strong, and would love some feedback.\n\nThank you.", "subreddit": "NarcissisticAbuse"}

One of them was my father kicking me several times on the ground when I was like, maybe 9. The other was my aunt (Died years ago, only saw her every year during the holidays in another country) acting in a inappropriate way toward little me. Like, kissing my face multiple times when I was alone, so that I had to hide and she would search for me. My father is now 65, he's old and has gotten calmer and more \"nice\" (Seemingly forgot about what he did in the past). My parents, while not 100% only abusive, would always beat me with a wooden spoon if let's say, I said I wouldn't be able to eat anymore or said something they didn't like. My father is from a big family and had a strict father (I wouldn't know, he's been dead before I was born), so he inherited those characteristics. He always talks loud, has anger issues and would use me to take his anger out. School was always hell for me. I suffered from insomnia so I would always be hella sleepy in school, had acidity, was bullied cause I was calm and shy and I guess a easy target. I have eating problems since my Depression started and have been underweight since then (170cm, 50kg). Due to that, I've always looked frail and young. I always had a young face in general, but if you see me you'd think I was 13 or 14. A female sexually harassed me when I was 16. Basically in every school I was in, I was bullied. I don't really have anybody. Had some internet friends, but they abandoned me a year ago and my mental health is kinda at a hold at the moment. I self harm since I'm 13 and opening up to my parents about it was the worst mistake. I would always get punished for it in the past. I've never seeked therapy. I don't really know what I have, from what I looked up so far, BPD seems to be it. Mood changes several times during the day. I often have headaches and my vision gets blurry, then I suddenly wake up when I don't even remember that I was going to sleep. My parents often talked about things to me which I can't remember, but apparently was there. Crying..feels weird since years? I remember a time where I was so depressed I couldn't even cry anymore and since then crying has been weird. I'm like, really sensitive and cried for years every day. I'm not sure if my voice even broke yet, I genuinely come off and sound like I'm a teen. I thought of and attempted suicide multiple times, though never succeeded and would then just forget about it. I'm bi, though probably 90% into dudes haha. I'm scared about the memories. It took so long for them to come back and I don't know why and I'm scared if there's anything else that I forgot and will remember. Englisch isn't my first language so I'm sorry for the bad english, just felt like needing to write this.", "subreddit": "abuse"}

(TRIGGER WARNING)", "author": "LapTheGreat", "self_text": "So..I'm feeling weird, and I want to write down what happened to me as a child and up. I dont know why, but I feel like letting it all out might be helpful somewhat. \n\nI have been physically, emotionally, and sexually abused in my entire lifetime. I am 15 years old and it's been the last 2 years that the PTSD from these events have really been catching up with me. Often, I trigger myself of purpose because it makes me dissociate, and that is a way I can escape reality for just a while. \n\n\nI was told it started when I was 2. My father and mother were both alcoholics, and my dad was very violent as one. I have no memory of this, but was told from my mother. This lasted until I was 14, in on and off intervals. I remember being chased around the house, walking on eggshells. I had mapped escape routes by the age of 8 and honestly my twin sister was all I had then. I was beat and cussed out regularly. I had no idea what i went through was abuse until age 12, when a friend confirmed my suspicion. My mother was an alcoholic until I was age 7, and that was when she quit. \n\nBefore then, though, I believe I was sexually abused by one of my uncles. I have very vague memories of it and honestly am terrified that it's real. I dont know if it is or not but alot of things point for and against it. I was a very sexual child even at the age of 5-6, where my cousin who was the same age used to touch me and my sister. Even after the abuse ended, I went on to seek approval from older men. I was age 10 when I sent my first nudes and stuff, and this lasted until I was 14. During this time, it became an obsession and I must have messed around will dozens and dozens of men and woman. All who were older, all who exploited me and my body. \n\nThe last time my dad drank was when I was 14, and now he is sober. Hes been sober for half a year and my biggest fear is him drinking again. He has caused me so much pain in my life that I just.. he loves me, but how can I love someone who is one of the main sources of my trauma? When he is angry, the hypervigilance comes back. The pounding heart, racing mind. I remember one time he stood up when he was angry and it was like something snapped inside of me. I ran out the door and cried so hard that I couldn't breathe. I was 14 then. \n\nI was also bullied at school, mostly verbally. This, along with the abuse and repressed trauma, caused me to fall into a deep depression around age 12. This lasted for 2 years and I developed an eating disorder that I still struggle with, along with self harm. \n\nI think that's all? I typed this out because I CANNOT say these words out loud. I will choke up. I physically cannot. I'm not ready yet. \n\nThank you for reading, if you got this far. My PTSD has been bad lately and I dont know what to do. I have a therapist, but again. I cant say these words out loud. If anyone has suggestions, tell me please. Thanks. \n\n- Lapis", "subreddit": "abuse"}

A little info on him: grew up with an abusive father who left, but he doesn\u2019t seem phased by it on the outside. He is very charismatic and outgoing. Everyone loves him. He\u2019s always there for his friends. He hasn\u2019t had a real job in 12 years so he\u2019s free to do what he pleases. Ever since he lost his sister he\u2019s been different.\n\nWe are currently \u201cseparated\u201d but still together...for the last year and a half he\u2019s had a pretty heavy cocaine problem and he\u2019s been a heavy drinker since we met 3 years ago. When we first met we were both emotionally unstable and we partied a lot. We got extremely close, very fast and we made each other very happy. We have all of the same interests, we can talk for hours. My family absolutely loved him and everything seemed perfect. We slowed down on the partying after about a year.\n\nTime goes on and he starts to get into the drinking/doing blow thing again. We fight at least once a week and it results in him staying away for 1-3 nights a week at his shop, or so I\u2019m led to believe. Sometimes he doesn\u2019t contact me or show up when we have plans. But when we aren\u2019t fighting and he\u2019s actually there, we are so happy.\n\nHe makes friends with this girl we both know and they both assure me at different times that I have nothing to worry about...out of the blue both times! Well, after one of our fights he messages me around 7am saying he\u2019s stuck at his shop. I saw the message and decided I wanted to make things right...I show up to his shop and SHE is there. I go inside and she is laying on his couch asleep and he\u2019s at the other end of the couch holding her hand. I get upset and walk out. He follows me and tells me it\u2019s \u201cnothing\u201d and why would he tell me that he was there if he was doing something wrong? Well, I\u2019m assuming he didn\u2019t know I would be up at 7am, that is unusual for me on my day off.\n\nFast forward one week exactly: he has lost his phone and can only communicate through some stupid app on his laptop. I haven\u2019t heard from him in over 24 hours. A couple of (then) friends invite me for dinner. One of my friends says they just saw my BF with that girl at the bar and they tried not to be noticed by him. I get upset and end up drinking too much and sending nasty messages to BF and girl. Friend goes outside to see that his car window was smashed by a cheap wine bottle (find out later for sure that it was BF and girl). Friend and I go down to the bar where we know they are and get into a fight...it doesn\u2019t go anywhere and honestly I don\u2019t even know what we were doing due to my intoxication. I go back to friend\u2019s house and fall asleep. I wake up at 3am and decide to go home, which is where I find art torn off the wall, money missing, my things missing and my cat is freaked out. \n\nI go down to his shop to find him and girl AGAIN. He comes outside and we scream and  fight and don\u2019t get anywhere. I\u2019m mad and decide to go in and talk to this girl, he pulls me back so I try again. This time when he pulls me back I fall to the ground and land on my foot. Now my foot is broken in 3 places. There is a LOT more to this whole story, but I\u2019ll spare some of the details.\n\nI don\u2019t know what to do. I stay with him because I feel hopeless. I live upstairs. I can\u2019t afford to live alone. It\u2019s only my name on the lease, but I have 7 more months. Sometimes he cares and takes care of me. Other times I\u2019m a burden.\n\nTwo months later, it\u2019s Thanksgiving...we\u2019ve been fighting, shocker!!! We play it off for the day. He leaves to go to his shop for a short time and says he\u2019ll be back, he doesn\u2019t come back. It\u2019s Friday and it\u2019s my family\u2019s Thanksgiving which is an hour away and he has to drive because my right foot is still broken. I take an Uber to his shop at noon, which is when we were supposed to be there. He doesn\u2019t know what time it is or care because he is high and drunk with one of his friends. If it hadn\u2019t been so late I would have had someone come get me (I should have done it no matter what). He spends the day outside with the guys and it\u2019s fine. I am upset so I get black out drunk (I\u2019ve quit drinking since). We leave and I come to while we\u2019re screaming at each other in my car and he\u2019s driving. He parks in the middle of a business\u2019 driveway and walks away. It\u2019s late, I can\u2019t find my phone, the contents of my backpack are all over the car. I see a bar across the road that is still open and I manage to drive to it. The bartender let\u2019s me use his phone to get ahold of my family to come get me. BF is there passed out. Bartender wakes him up and he goes out and gets in my car. Family shows up and drives me and my BF and car back to their home. We had been gone for over 2 hours and we made it 1 mile from their house, I don\u2019t know what happened for 2 hours but I\u2019m bruised bad, like I fell. What happened?? I still don\u2019t know and it scares me. My family sends him home in an Uber.\n\nOne week later and we\u2019ve only texted because he\u2019s extremely sick and doesn\u2019t want to get me sick. He says he\u2019s sorry over and over. He says I don\u2019t deserve the way he\u2019s been treating me. He tells me that he owes his life to me. He tells me he loves me more than anything. He says he needs me. He says that his brain has been unbalanced for a while and it\u2019s from the drugs and alcohol. He said he knows he needs to change. I decide to wait, why not? When he\u2019s sober things are amazing.\n\nTwo weeks later, he\u2019s still sick. I know he\u2019s been around people, so why can\u2019t he talk to me? The last excuse was he\u2019s having an \u201cemotional\u201d and exhausting day. Well, that\u2019s what every day is for me. I have a hard time taking care of myself and I\u2019m trying to heal.\n\nAm I crazy for waiting? Am I being abused? Manipulated? Is it time for me to move on? Does anyone have a similar story?

The thing is that it wasn't forced or anything.

A little background second.\n\nI am enrolling in an online class that is a professor led live feed. Found out today I am not allowed to have my children in the vicinity while I am logged in. I was honestly relying on them being allowed to be in my care as I had no choice.  After a brief but hard breakdown i remembered that id seen a post on FB about an opening at  a daycare down the road that is affordable enough that I can put my 3 year old daughter in. I'll have to hide the 3 month old from the cam.\nHow do I explain to my narc that 3yr old will be attending daycare for a while?  I mean like what possible reason can I justify this with?  I obviously cant hide it, she'll be talking about it. And point it out if they drive by.\n\n\nSo the details.  I am getting the hell out of here. Im doing it secret squirrel style. I have to.    He has sabotaged everything in my life.  The company i have been with for 9 years is selling off all their properties. My last paycheck will be in January.  I mentioned just to see what hed say, that since i was loosing my income that i was gonna take an online class so i could continue doing what I've been doing but with a company in our area.( property management)  figured this might go over well considering i wasnt making a change to anything.  I Did Not mention daycare or anything.     He immediately ignores what i said and instead tells me....I cant make this up.....(we live in BFE).....he tells me that I am to start trapping hogs and selling them.  Inside im like wtf mf???!!! But I reply \"well um i dont think thats safe for me to be doing with a 3 yr old and a 3 month old\" then he just repeats himself.  Hes freaking serious! The look on his face tells me hes been thinking about this for a while. This is what he thinks his wife and babies should be doing to earn money. He does not dip, does not wear his jeans inside his boots, he has sleeves, his truck isn't louder or dirtier than yours, this is a respectable looking man. I only include this because one might imagine if he did fit those characteristics then it might not be such a surprise.\n\nI can have the ability to make good money that I can support myself on and all my kids in a matter of 5 months and hopefully have saved enough for a lawyer if I can just get my 3 year old into daycare for 3 weeks.   Please i need help.  Ive been planning this for weeks/ months and was so excited, i finally felt hope and peace and now i jist feel like a rock was thrown ontop of me.

The narcissist in my life was a best friend and roommate, not a partner or family member. It makes me cringe thinking of all the things I did for him. \n\nLong story short, he took advantage of me for 3-4 years. It got steadily worse as time went on. I paid for his groceries for a year because his family was struggling and he, of course, couldn\u2019t hold a job. He was an insufferable know-it-all who threw temper tantrums from Hell. I lost friendships because I defended him to people who (correctly) pointed out he was taking advantage of me. Then I graduated, and because he failed multiple classes every semester, he was still two years behind me despite us starting uni at the same time. \n\nI think the absence of my enabling caused him to get significantly worse. He started abusing another roommate and mutual friend. He expected her and their other roommates to wait on him hand and foot. When they put told him he had to contribute to the household chores \u2014 dishes, trash, cleaning up after HIS pets \u2014 he threw another tantrum that resulted in him moving out. He blocked his roommates, me, my partner, all our friends\u2014 even though none of them were involved. He dropped out. Last I heard, he was unemployed and technically homeless. \n\nHe absolutely did it to himself. Once he was out of my life, it was like someone pulled off a blindfold. In hindsight, he\u2019d been abusing and manipulating me for years. I feel so stupid. Especially because, despite knowing ALL of this, it still hurts. I still miss him! \n\nWe had so many good times in that apartment. Me, him, our other roommates, and my partner were like a family; we did everything together.

We were together 8 years, and I broke up with him after a really difficult and confusing year with some of the highest highs and lowest lows of our relationship. I started realizing he may be a narcissist shortly after I ended things, because he was a serial gaslighter/emotional abuser and his behavior post breakup was baffling. \n\nWe last spoke a year ago, when he asked to get coffee with me only to announce that he was dating someone new. At the time I was still trying to make sense of everything while also navigating my own new relationship (bad choice; I had never dealt with a breakup before since my ex was my first. I\u2019m trying to be kind to myself about it). \n\nWhen I broke up with my ex, he was professing his eternal love for me, over and over. He stressed that he\u2019d be alone for the rest of his life, that he\u2019d never find someone he loved as much as he loved me, I\u2019m too unique, special, blah blah blah. When we met up 6 months later (last December), he was incredibly cruel and sent numerous mixed messages and it left me reeling. I went NC shortly thereafter and ignored a couple of super mild/indirect hoovering attempts early in the year. \n\nWell, a couple days ago I got an email from him (I thought I had blocked him everywhere) asking whether he could send me a letter in the mail (???). I messaged the only mutual friend we have left and asked whether he knew what it was about, and he was horrified. Apparently, my ex is asking his new supply to marry him over the holidays. Both of our guesses were that he was likely contacting me to make another \u201cannouncement\u201d, potentially also including some string of condescending/backhanded apologies (like he had done last December) or more mixed messages. \n\nI have decided to ignore the email, but it\u2019s so difficult. The part of me that believes in universal order and \u201cdestiny\u201d (that he played so well) wants him to be realizing the error of his ways and trying to rekindle things.

This is my way of calling you out, because I don't know your last name or what you're doing now, and this is all that remains of you - your first name. If I knew your last name, I'd have reported you years ago. You should feel damn lucky I can't remember.\n\nI was eight or nine when it started. So young that I don't even recall the exact age. And you were eleven. See, you were smart. You guessed, correctly, that people (namely, I) wouldn't take what was going on as seriously because we were both kids. And surely abuse can't happen between kids, right?\n\nYou were living in the house my parents were renting out. We were neighbours. Your mother would send you and your brother to my house to play with me and my siblings. One time when we were all in the same room, you said you thought that I looked pretty. Or something along those lines. I asked you, \"do you have a crush on me?\" I remember this like it was yesterday. You were sitting on my chair by my desk, right next to the window, spinning a little. You said, \"kinda.\" It was enough to pique my attention. I told you exactly what I thought. \"Wow...no one's ever really told me that before.\" I didn't think I was pretty, and I definitely hadn't received any attention from the boys at my school.\n\nYou hooked onto that sentence. I don't remember exactly what you said next but you encouraged my admiration.\n\nOne day, you and your brother came over to my house. You told him and my siblings that the older kids (us) wanted to hang out together in my room, and that they could go and play in my sibling's room. I was happy because I was one of the big kids in this situation. Even your brother didn't get to come in the same room as us! I must have been special. That's what I was thinking.\n\nYou closed the door. It started slowly. On the first day, you told me you wanted to play mums and dads. I said sure, because I'd played it with my friends at school. I never really saw the point of the game but I didn't mind. You said, \"you be the mum, I'll be the dad.\" Then you climbed to the top of your bunk bed and said, \"mums and dads sleep next to each other. Climb up.\" I did it. I climbed up and lay next to you. Why did I do it? I thought it was fine, in all honesty - we were just lying next to each other, nothing untoward about that, at least in my eyes.\n\nSometimes, you would get your brother and my sister to pretend to be our children, and include them in the game too.\n\nThis first day, you told me it was our secret. I was kind of excited that you had entrusted me with a secret. I said I wouldn't tell anyone. \"You promise?\" you asked. \"Yes,\" I said.\n\nThe second time, we were playing in your backyard. You asked me, \"do you know what humping is?\" I said no. So the next time you came over to my house, you took me to my room (alone, again) and you went ahead and decided to show me. I don't think I moved at all during it. You kept pushing yourself up against me. We were standing up and you had your hands around my waist to keep me in the same spot. I knew it was wrong and I knew I didn't like it. Why didn't I ask you to stop?\n\nThe third time, we sat under the doorway to my room whilst your brother and my siblings were busy playing in the other room. You said you would teach me to kiss. I was apprehensive but said okay. I thought you meant kiss as in a peck on the lips. But you said, \"tilt your head to the right and open your mouth. Then, you have to swirl your tongue around with mine.\" I remember thinking that sounded disgusting, but I did it anyway. You took my first kiss at the age of eight or nine. Why didn't I just tell you I didn't want to do it?\n\nThe fourth time, we were in my room, door closed, and you said you wanted to see my boobs. This time was a very firm no. I told you, straight up, \"no.\" There was a line and I knew that of everything we had done, if nothing else, this definitely crossed it. Then you started doing what you did every time I said I didn't want to do something. You said, \"come on, please. Please? Come on. It's fine.\" And you would keep badgering me until I said yes. And so I lifted my shirt up. You gasped a little when you saw what you wanted to see. By the way - I was a little kid. I wasn't even in my double-digits stage yet so there was nothing really there at all. You lifted your hand and tried to touch my bare chest but I pulled my shirt down before you could.\n\nThe fifth time, you were humping me and told me to take my clothes off. I said I didn't want to. You started the begging again. \"Please? Come on, it'll be fine. Please?\" And this is where my memory is blurry. I don't remember whether I took my clothes off or not. But I have faint memories which make me believe that you convinced me to take off my top and my pants. Why can't I remember?\n\nEvery time you came over to my house you would do these things to me. The thing I remember you doing the most was the humping. You would always get me alone in your room and push yourself on me. As I write this, some memories are coming back. I think one time you told me to lay down in the bottom bunk and you got on top of me and started humping me. I always said no or at least showed some sort of apprehension. You were eleven, not three. You knew what you were doing. I don't know any eleven year old that would tell me doing what you did is an acceptable thing to do.\n\nYour mother was lovely. And I remember thinking that's what was so sad - that your mother was lovely, and so was your little brother. And your dad wasn't in the picture but the family you had was beautiful. And I loved your mother. She was so kind to me. I don't completely remember her face anymore but I remember her kindness.\n\nYour family moved out about six months after they moved in. Before you all left, your mother came over to tell us what school you would be moving to. I remember the feeling of my stomach dropping. It was like I had just reached the peak of a massive drop on a rollercoaster. The name of the school was the school right next to the school I would be attending in a couple of years. And I thought there was no escape from you.\n\nThankfully for me, I only ever saw you once more after you moved away. Our schools (a brother and sister school that often held joint events) were planning yet another event together. We were in a crowd but I spotted your face. There was a new mole on your left cheek that hadn't been there when you were living next door to me. We made eye contact. And what did you do?\n\nYou smirked.\n\nYou had the *audacity* to smirk at me. I remember the feeling of intense rage I felt at the time, and I glared back as hard as I could. And then as quickly as I had spotted you, you disappeared back into the crowd. Since then, I haven't seen you for at least five years.\n\nI remember your face. I remember your brother's face. And I have looked for you, but I haven't found you. If I do find you, I don't know what I'll do yet. I don't have much in the way of evidence. It's probably too late to report you now anyway. But I hope you know what you did caused a lot of damage. I've had really nice guys show interest in me and I have to say no because I'm worried they're going to do something I don't want them to do. I feel like you gave me a pair of glasses and they're stuck permanently to my head, and these glasses are blurry and I can't tell the good guys from the bad. I'm paranoid whenever I see a guy, and even more paranoid when he's nice to me, because I don't know whether he's being nice just to be nice, or being nice for an ulterior motive. I'm scared that guys are trying to be my friends just as a stepping stone to becoming something more, which in my eyes is nefarious. I just can't trust any man.\n\nIt's not just that. I told my parents what you did, about a year after you moved away. Yes, I broke our promise. The promise you made me make to not tell anyone about what you were doing. I came home from school one day and just broke down crying. I had told a friend in school earlier that day about what you did, and she told me I should tell my parents - and that whole day, the guilt had been eating me up inside. So I burst into tears. My mum came to pick me up and was so worried. She asked me what was wrong. All I could muster up the courage to say between sobs was, \"Do you remember when that family lived in our other house? Matthew would try to kiss me.\"\n\nWhen I got to the car, one of my siblings asked why I was crying. My mother just said that something had happened at school. I sat crying in the car until we got home and my parents called me into their bedroom. They asked me what happened. I could tell by their faces that they were angry. Not angry at you - they were angry at me. But it was a quiet anger. They didn't yell, but their faces spoke loud enough. So I said, \"he humped me.\" My parents grew up in a very conservative culture. They asked me, \"what is humping?\" And so, at the age of about nine or ten, I had to stand in front of my parents and explain what humping was. I said, \"It's like hugging, but you put your arms down by your side, and you move back and forth.\" I did not speak of the french kissing, you looking at my boobs, or anything else. Especially not the looking at my boobs part. I thought that was my fault, because I was the one who had lifted my shirt, and I felt that I was complicit in this, and so I didn't want my parents to know. I felt I was as much a perpetrator as you.\n\nThey sent me back to my room, and never mentioned you again. I know they still blame me for not telling them earlier. But what could I have said? The first time they found out I had a crush on a guy (when I was about seven), they slapped me in front of my entire family and humiliated me by reading poems I wrote about him (that they had found while snooping through my room). So I sure as hell wasn't going to tell my parents about you, Matthew.\n\nI started counselling a few days ago. I WILL get over what you did to me. It wasn't okay and I never saw it as abuse until recently because we were both kids. I have repressed this for over ten years and I will repress it no longer. I hope you feel the same pain I feel now, knowing the truth. I hope you regret it all the time. But most of all, I hope you never do this (and have never done this), or worse, to anyone.\n\nI know a lot of people who are victims to these sorts of things say that they forgive them. It may just be early days, but - I don't forgive you. Not now. Maybe not ever. I don't know whether I have to forgive to heal. Maybe I'll forgive you of my own accord one day. But right now, I hate you. I hate you with every fibre of my being. I don't care that you're older than me or taller than me or stronger than me. I want to punch you so bad. And I know I shouldn't say that but it's what I feel. I want you to feel pain.\n\nSo, Matthew - whether you read this or not, writing this has been a big help to me. The friends I've told about what you did to me have been so much more supportive than what I could ever have asked for. One even had a similar experience as a child, too, that I didn't know about until recently. And my heart aches for him, as it does when I think about what happened to me. You may have been eleven, but you knew what you were doing.\n\n\\*Matthew is his real name. I don't think he deserves to hide behind a pseudonym.", "subreddit": "abuse"}

I'm writing this for me, not you. I couldn't care less about you if I tried.\n\nI'm sure you think you did nothing wrong. Or maybe you know, but you're just so cocky you don't care. This is my way of calling you out, because I don't know your last name or what you're doing now, and this is all that remains of you - your first name. If I knew your last name, I'd have reported you years ago. You should feel damn lucky I can't remember.\n\nI was eight or nine when it started. So young that I don't even recall the exact age. And you were eleven. See, you were smart. You guessed, correctly, that people (namely, I) wouldn't take what was going on as seriously because we were both kids. And surely abuse can't happen between kids, right?\n\nYou were living in the house my parents were renting out. We were neighbours. Your mother would send you and your brother to my house to play with me and my siblings. One time when we were all in the same room, you said you thought that I looked pretty. Or something along those lines. I asked you, \"do you have a crush on me?\" I remember this like it was yesterday. You were sitting on my chair by my desk, right next to the window, spinning a little. You said, \"kinda.\" It was enough to pique my attention. I told you exactly what I thought. \"Wow...no one's ever really told me that before.\" I didn't think I was pretty, and I definitely hadn't received any attention from the boys at my school.\n\nYou hooked onto that sentence. I don't remember exactly what you said next but you encouraged my admiration.\n\nOne day, you and your brother came over to my house. You told him and my siblings that the older kids (us) wanted to hang out together in my room, and that they could go and play in my sibling's room. I was happy because I was one of the big kids in this situation. Even your brother didn't get to come in the same room as us! I must have been special. That's what I was thinking.\n\nYou closed the door. It started slowly. On the first day, you told me you wanted to play mums and dads. I said sure, because I'd played it with my friends at school. I never really saw the point of the game but I didn't mind. You said, \"you be the mum, I'll be the dad.\" Then you climbed to the top of your bunk bed and said, \"mums and dads sleep next to each other. Climb up.\" I did it. I climbed up and lay next to you. Why did I do it? I thought it was fine, in all honesty - we were just lying next to each other, nothing untoward about that, at least in my eyes.\n\nSometimes, you would get your brother and my sister to pretend to be our children, and include them in the game too.\n\nThis first day, you told me it was our secret. I was kind of excited that you had entrusted me with a secret. I said I wouldn't tell anyone. \"You promise?\" you asked. \"Yes,\" I said.\n\nThe second time, we were playing in your backyard. You asked me, \"do you know what humping is?\" I said no. So the next time you came over to my house, you took me to my room (alone, again) and you went ahead and decided to show me. I don't think I moved at all during it. You kept pushing yourself up against me. We were standing up and you had your hands around my waist to keep me in the same spot. I knew it was wrong and I knew I didn't like it. Why didn't I ask you to stop?\n\nThe third time, we sat under the doorway to my room whilst your brother and my siblings were busy playing in the other room. You said you would teach me to kiss. I was apprehensive but said okay. I thought you meant kiss as in a peck on the lips. But you said, \"tilt your head to the right and open your mouth. Then, you have to swirl your tongue around with mine.\" I remember thinking that sounded disgusting, but I did it anyway. You took my first kiss at the age of eight or nine. Why didn't I just tell you I didn't want to do it?\n\nThe fourth time, we were in my room, door closed, and you said you wanted to see my boobs. This time was a very firm no. I told you, straight up, \"no.\" There was a line and I knew that of everything we had done, if nothing else, this definitely crossed it. Then you started doing what you did every time I said I didn't want to do something. You said, \"come on, please. Please? Come on. It's fine.\" And you would keep badgering me until I said yes. And so I lifted my shirt up. You gasped a little when you saw what you wanted to see. By the way - I was a little kid. I wasn't even in my double-digits stage yet so there was nothing really there at all. You lifted your hand and tried to touch my bare chest but I pulled my shirt down before you could.\n\nThe fifth time, you were humping me and told me to take my clothes off. I said I didn't want to. You started the begging again. \"Please? Come on, it'll be fine. Please?\" And this is where my memory is blurry. I don't remember whether I took my clothes off or not. But I have faint memories which make me believe that you convinced me to take off my top and my pants. Why can't I remember?\n\nEvery time you came over to my house you would do these things to me.

His \u201cgood girl\u201d praises, like I was a dog, sent my heart soaring, but it also stirred a deep anxiety within me. Attached to the \u201cgood girls\u201d were \u201cbut next time, do this.\u201d The bar was ever higher. \n\nWe\u2019ve always had terrible fights filled with silent treatments, calling me a liar, and cussing. He told me things like \u201cI will fucking hate you if you make me leave\u201d when I wanted to go home one night, \u201cshut the fuck up\u201d when he didn\u2019t like what I was saying, and \u201cyou just like to act like you\u2019re smart\u201d when I voiced an opinion opposed to his. He would throw away my flowers during fights, pick and pick at my words until I was a foggy mess crying on the floor, and tell me I\u2019m too sensitive and that all couples fight like this. He would claim I wasn\u2019t spending enough money in the relationship, even though he made 3x as much as I did, and I paid for half of the household expenses. \n\nFive years later, I\u2019ve called off two weddings and left him at least seven times, but he always comes after me, tells me he will be different. I remember one of the times he proposed to me, he told me in the morning that I was unfit to be a mother, and in the afternoon, he proposed, wanting my children.\n\nI recently tried to initiate another breakup. I told him we were fighting too much and that I was unhappy. He told me come home and we would talk, lay it all out. I did, except for telling him he was a covert narcissist, and he picked at my arguments until I felt my claims were baseless. \u201cI don\u2019t even remember these things happening.\u201d \u201cFor some reason, these events burn in your mind.\u201d \u201cI told my mom about our arguments and she said \u2018why is she so sensitive?\u2019\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t think you will ever be happy in a relationship - everyone fights.\u201d \u201cMaybe you will be happier alone.\u201d \n\nI ended up crying, and that\u2019s where we left the conversation, and now we\u2019re just avoiding the topic .

I would make up fantasies in my head about me winning an argument with him if I ran into him, or me walking right past him in public to enstil NC. The last time I contacted him was to respond saying that I mailed the keys back in November 2018.\n\nThe months following that, he had sent me a few angry emails that I wasn't talking to him. Then followed by a bunch of sappy \"Merry Christmas\" and \"what I wish I could have done\" hoovering emails. I never responded to any of them.\n\nFastforward to last week, my friend and I were going on a nature walk and it was raining outside. There was no one on the trail. We turned around to head back to the car after about 45 minutes, and we were quite deep in the woods.\n\nWe are walking back and we hear some people approaching. My friend was a little ahead of me and he turns to me and says \"Dude, it's him\". I froze. I thought about turning around and walking away so they didnt see it was me. Now that won't work. I thought about avoiding them by walking behind some trees. That wouldn't work either. I stopped, took a breath and we continued towards my nex and his friend. This was it. I have to face this now.\n\nMy nex, his usual fake self with the overbearing \"hey man!! how's it going?\" and hugs to my friend was the main focus. And then my nex turns to me. \"Hey, (my name)....do wanna...ehh?\" with his arms out asking for a hug. My initial reaction was to be civil so I started to say \"yeah\" and had my arms out and then before I could blink again I said \"ehhh, actually... nah\". The nex said \"aw okay.\". Then what proceded to feel like a long time listening to his word salad such as \"wow, out of all the days to run into each other, it's December 1st!\" (the day was actually December 2nd, and even if it was the right day, what does that even mean?).\n\nEventually we went our separate ways and after 15 seconds of walking away from them (we were going opposite directions) I hugged my friend. We were both shook, but I had never felt so strong in my life. Here I was, thinking it was going to destroy me to face him again, and when I actually ran into him, I felt calm and grounded.\n\nI want to thank this community for helping me on my journey of healing and rebuilding strength after the discard.

I\u2019ve had a very hard time opening up about it and thought that maybe sharing it here would bring me support and comfort...\n\nI was in a three year relationship with someone who I thought I loved. I was in 9th grade when we began dating. As we grew up things began to turn sour. He began to not respect my body, he would finger me until I bled despite me telling him to be careful and telling him it hurt. At the age of 16 I was raped by him. It was my first time and I was nervous. He took me to a secluded lake. Toward the end I told him to stop, I said it twice and told him he was hurting me. He didn\u2019t listen. I felt helpless as he was on top of me. I felt sick to my stomach. Once he finished I began to cry, I lied and said I liked it because I did not understand what just happened to me. Later that night I called him and told him I thought he raped me. I remember crying in my bathroom, bleeding and sore. I stayed in the relationship, convinced it was just a mistake and a misunderstanding. He continued to gaslight me, he made me believe I was some horrible bitch who was never good enough for him. During this time he would also continued to finger me until I would bleed. During senior year I was in pain and had some kind of infection, after visiting my gynecologist I found out that I had an infection and a tear that required medication. I was told it was from sex and to be sure to use lubericant, I knew it was from how rough he would finger me. In January after my senior colors day school dance he brought me home and began kissing me. I told him I needed to go inside as it was very late. He grabbed my wrists and continued to kiss me holding his hand around my neck. He pulled my hair so hair I began to get a headache. I felt scared and as I tried to get out of the car he began to unbutton my flannel shirt and put his hands down my pants. I continued to tell him to stop and that I needed to go inside. That night I felt broken, and I had enough. I finally got the courage to end things when I did he asked me \u201ccould we not have had sex one more time?\u201d Later on he sent me a horrible text message about how nobody could ever love me, and that nobody will ever treat me like he did. After the intital pain I felt relieved to finally be free, but also very confused. I knew everything he did was wrong but was it abuse? I continued to suppress that though as I finished out my senior year. Seeing him in school made me angry. My peers constantly questioned why I broke up with him, and some of them even felt bad for him. At this time I met my boyfriend, who is now my fianc\u00e9. The people in my class who were friends with my abuser began to harass my now fianc\u00e9. They would call him, text him, and poke fun at him. One night my abuser even snap chatted him a picture of him having sex with another girl. In my confusion I tried to make amends by doing stupid things like picking up his book and putting it away when he would leave it behind in class. On graduation night, I even felt the need to be friends with him on Instagram, I was so overcome with confusion I felt that I had done something wrong and needed to be kind to him. I regret that so much. I am finally healing and recognizing what he did was wrong. I still question if I was raped and abused, but I truly believe that is from PTSD. I used to not be able to recall any details from the abuse, hell I couldn\u2019t even feel any emotions when I would try to think about it. I was numb. As I have processed this, I am able to cry, I am able to feel angry, and I am able to accept what happened to me. I still have nightmares, and I still have bad days but I am healing.

I thought she wanted a real relationship with me.*\n\nThat person you\u2019re missing is a lie, because she didn\u2019t really mean any of the good things she said or did. That\u2019s why she was able to change so abruptly and abuse you, leave you, and never come back. How could she have treated you like that if she meant all the things she said to you in the beginning. She switched out of nowhere, kept you around to abuse you, then left after putting all the blame on you and never came back. That\u2019s why it seems like two different people, because the second her is the real one. The real her can\u2019t bond and can\u2019t have empathy. The real her is the abuser, the liar, the manipulator who gaslighted and triangulated you. She\u2019s hallow inside, miserable, and only treated you well at first for the validation you would give her by reciprocating the feelings. You don\u2019t miss that, do you? \n\n*Well I\u2019m still sad because I see her on social media with her boyfriend. She looks so happy, they look so happy, and I think they\u2019ve dated for months now. They\u2019re holding each other and smiling. I wanted that exact thing with her. I thought she wanted it with me.*\n\nSocial media is another way for her to get validation, just like her never ending pursuit of romantic partners. She lies on social media just like she does about her personality, identity, and when she love-bombs. She is with him in the first place for validation and because she can\u2019t be alone, just like she was with you. He is her accessory. She is posting it on social media because it gives her validation. Look at all the likes from friends and the comments from her mother. She doesn\u2019t mean anything with him just like she didn\u2019t with you. Remember, the real her is the abuser. The real her is someone who cannot love, empathize, be happy with herself. How could someone like that give genuine romance to a partner? She will grow tired of faking and show her true self eventually.

Another time when we were not dating (but were talking to each other romantically again) she slept with someone at her friends wedding. \n\nI really don't know what I am doing wrong. She makes me out to be a sex-crazed monster when all I want is to have an intimate moment with my partner. Of course whenever she's in the mood we can have sex, but if I even want to make out its never the right time. Again, I know she's a victim of sexual assault so I know that this could very well be why she has no sex drive. But it just seems like its only an issue when it comes to me. \n\nIf anyone has any advice on how to handle this, I would really appreciate it. I want to do my best to understand where she is coming from and I don't want to make her trauma worse. I just do not understand what I am doing wrong.", "subreddit": "NarcissisticAbuse"}

I\u00a0 really wanted to have some questions answered and see if anyone has had similar experiences. Also, I guess this would need a trigger warning for sexual assault/abuse and incest, even though I have a hard time seeing it like that. This may be lengthy so thank you to anyone who fully reads through. And even more so to those who answer.\n\nTo start off, my cousin has always been very touchy with me. He is three years older than me, and these incidents happened when I was around 6 and he 9. He has always been a kind of messed up kid and had a hard childhood, his younger sister passed away, parents divorced, stuff like that. Because of this his mother was always super lenient and allowed him whatever, so he got very into violence at a young age. This always lead to games when we were young of shooting, and mafia, but it always ended in him tying me up in some way. He would always very harshly push me down onto a chair/bed and lay or sit on top of me. This always lead to him touching me in inappropriate places and kissing me. Of course, me being young and naive I believed him when he said I'd get in trouble if I told anyone.\n\nThis course of action lead on for a few years until I was around 10. At that point, I was very sick of touching and kissing and would do everything to avoid being alone with him. He grew to have an unhealthy obsession with getting me alone and even had and the idea that we were going to get married when we were older. When I told him we couldn't, as we were cousins, he insisted and asked my mother if that was true. Stuff like this just continued to happen whenever he came over to my house or stayed the night. Even when I tried to get him to do normal things with me, like play barbies, it would always turn back into something sexual. I assume my cousin finally realized this was wrong, as he stopped touching me when I was around 13.\n\nHowever; incidents like this happened again but with my older brother. In some cases, this was worse, and others better. A few incidents of my brother touching me happened when I was younger, similar to my cousin but it never escalated until we were older. My brother is only a year and a few months older than me, so we would always be 13 and 14 or 13 and 15. My brother mainly sexualized me like an object though and didn't really touch. Asking me to send him nude pictures, showing me porn, or asking me things about masturbation, or telling me how he would get off to me. Sometimes doing it in front of me, and forcing me to watch. The only incident where he kind-of touched me, was when he humped me over my clothes until he came. Once, I went to take a shower and found his phone set up on my dresser to record me getting dressed. That's when things finally stopped, and I guess he grew out of it.\n\nThis being said: he and I are still very close. Our relationship was somehow not damaged by this. We have never talked about it, or mentioned it and act like completely normal siblings. He's honestly my best friend, and I trust him completely. Things cant be said for my cousin, however, as I still feel like he would touch me if given the chance, and generally makes too-friendly of comments. I have never spoken about this to anyone. Not my parents, friends or even therapists. My brother especially is a good person, and very respected in our family. I would never want to say anything to make people look at him differently, especially after all these years.\n\nI guess I'm just looking for clarity, as this situation happened twice with different family members. Has anyone else experienced situations like this with older brothers or cousins? Is this just a normal hormonal thing for young boys? I'm seventeen now and honestly don't know if I was even traumatized from this. I suppose I'm just seeking some clarity. On some base understanding, I realize what they did was wrong and manipulative. But I can't seem to look at them as abusers. Even making this post, is strange because I have to word it as \"sexual abuse\", even when I have a hard time even acknowledging that's what it was. I guess I'm hoping someone will tell me that this is a normal thing for boys to do to girls in their families. \n\nThank you to anyone who read this far down.\u00a0\u00a0", "subreddit": "survivorsofabuse"}

{"post_id": "eaepcv", "created_utc": 1576294742, "title": "Drug-Induced Narcissism?", "author": "PsychologicalPenguin", "self_text": "Sorry for the length, just wanted to share my story and see if anyone else has had experiences with narcs that are created through drug use.\n\nIn February of 2017, I was working at a grocery store and had a customer come in. We instantly hit it off and I found out he was homeless and unemployed, so I paid for his groceries. He gives me his number, we make plans to meet up again during which I found out he was a meth user. The relationship evolves pretty quickly, to the point where I choose to be homeless with him. I had a large sum of money saved up at this point, which had been disclosed. It's also worth noting that he had recently went no contact with his own narc, which he had been involved with for 6 years, and the aftermath involved him doing a full nose-dive into researching narcissists and psychopaths.\n\nIt first began with him claiming that I'm his angel and was sent to save him. But despite this, he's hesitant to put the boyfriend/girlfriend label on us, as \"it's just a word.\" I quickly go from being his \"savior\" to being \"evil\" and a \"psychopath.\" He wants me to admit to being evil and list the reasons why I am. I learn that he despises lies, and begin to be accused of lying constantly. I learn that he's basically a sex addict and he begins demanding a threesome from me and to keep an eye out for possible candidates. He has too many storage units and hoards things, for which I begin paying the bills. I get accused of purposely sabotaging him into leaving late, which gets him in trouble with management. I get accused of wanting to destroy his stuff.\nHe has a parasitic infection, for which there is no cure, and he self-mutilates to get rid of the worms. I get accused of enjoying his suffering, as I haven't found a cure. I become a \"time-waster\" and he complains that he is unable to get any work done when I'm around, which I do purposely to sabotage him, of course. Meanwhile, he claims he's empathetic and sent by God to wipe out evil. I stay.\n\nThen the physical abuse starts. I had started using as well within about 2-3 months of meeting him. It started suddenly and unexpectedly. I was laying on him in his truck while he was scrolling through my Facebook, asking me millions of questions about every single person and how I knew them. He had found that I still had an ex-boyfriend's number saved in my contacts, and suddenly I'm slapped in the face. Completely caught off guard, I start crying. He starts once again berating me, tells me the relationship is over. He takes me to his storage unit, puts a pocket knife to my throat, and forces me to give him a blowjob if I want to stay in his life. \"But stop crying because it's a turn-off.\" I stay. \n\nI had confided in him that I had been molested as a child by my own brother. This becomes his favorite ammunition. \"Brother-fucker,\" \"you liked it,\" \"you would have told someone if you really wanted it to stop,\" \"suck my dick and pretend that I'm your brother.\" I stay.\n\nHe begins making me pay him for my \"screw-ups.\" He decides on the price based on how bad he deems it, everywhere from $500 to $2500. I pay. \n\nHe begins basically using sex against me. I'm one who associates sex with love, and will have loving thoughts while having sex. I'm accused of being a liar, he \"knows I have dark fantasies I'm hiding.\" He convinces me to commit sexual acts I'm uncomfortable with. He forces me to watch porn with him, and I have to pick the category. He flirts with other women in front of me, even having me take nude pictures of him that he was pretending to send to someone else as \"payback.\" If I cry, he gets mad. I do what he says.\n\nI can't sleep because if I do, he doesn't want to disturb me so he can't get any work done. I can't stay awake because if I do, he'll talk to me and won't get any work done. I can't let him sleep because he's on a tight schedule and needs to work. If he falls asleep and I wake him up, I don't care about his well-being. If I do nothing while he sleeps, I'm accused of being lazy and a sloth. If I touch his things while he sleeps, I'm purposely hiding things he needs so that he won't be able to find them. I LITERALLY CAN'T win, but I stay. \n\nEight months in, we get a dog, my first dog. I love him to death, he's the most innocent creature ever. I'm \"a terrible dog mom\" and \"the dog is gone\" becomes a constant threat. The dog HATES fighting and shouting, he'll run away in fear if a fight, verbal or otherwise, begins. He knows this and purposely instigates fights with the van or trailer door open. I have to spend hours looking for the dog because he claims no ownership of the dog. \n\nThe abuse gets worse, both sexually and physically. I eventually begin to defend myself. I've learned to walk on eggshells and essentially disregard how I feel, but there are times where I'm incapable of hiding my true feelings. If I disrespect him, it's validation for him to \"discipline\" me. However, he can say whatever cruel, terrible things he wants to me. He dumps water on me in the middle of winter. He throws a bag of the dog's poop at me. I'm \"lazy\" because I haven't done laundry, even though he's the only one who can drive and doesn't make time to take me to a laundromat. I start washing our blankets in a parking lot, per his suggestion. We get kicked out that night. It's my fault for not having it done yet. He drives a few parking lots over and I have to bring back the dripping wet laundry by foot. The crate it was in had broken due to the weight of the wet clothes. I bring it all back silently. \n\nThere's a lot I've forgotten due to time, drug-use, or simply chosen to forget. But it continues. \n\nIn mid-July of 2018, my snapping point comes. We had just been kicked out of yet another parking lot and the business owner had given us a specific time to be gone by. Of course we were spread out like crazy and had to strategically place things in order to fit it all in our trailer and van. Any \"error\" I made was \"purposeful sabotage.\" I eventually give up and go in the van. He mocks me by asking \"stupid questions\" and calls me names. He eventually finishes and we go to the recycling center and park there. He creates some elaborate lie about how he had planned all of our setbacks and was puppeteering everything. I call him a liar and explain to him for the millionth time that we're on the same side. He comes and lays down with me and begins to imply that a blowjob would appease him. I snap. I fucking snap. I kick him in the leg, HARD. He calls the cops. They couldn't really hear anything besides fighting, I assure them nothing was wrong. I tell him he's like his narc, who would always threaten to falsely call the police on him, and that I'd never call the cops on him despite his abuse. I urge him to drive before the cops come.\n\nHe is absolutely livid that I had kicked him. He grabs my entire face, hair, whatever he can grab. He yanks my glasses off my face and snaps them in two. He starts driving like a mad man, screaming his head off, nearly driving off the rails of the highway. He eventually parks, I blindly begin grabbing my money, documents, clothes, etc. I tell him I'm never talking to him again. I call the dog, as he's mine, right? He slams the dog against the wall because he's starting to come to me after I asked if he wanted to go outside. I eventually get the dog leashed up and leave with him and the two bags I had. I call some friends from work, they pick me up and help me. \n\nI went no contact for a month, despite daily harassment and stalking. I informed my place of employment that I wanted nothing to do with him. I get sappy texts telling me he's nothing without me, I get threatening texts, I get accused of leaving him for a co-worker, I get more love-bombing. I ignore it all until,  eventually, I snap and contact him and tell him I want to see him. He arrives and tackle-hugs me onto the grass. I tell him to look me in the eyes and admit he's a narcissist. He does so. I have him repeat this three times. \n\nEverything was fine for the two days we spent together. Then, it flipped to the way it had been. I was shitty for ghosting him, blah blah blah!!!!! Shut up! I tell him if he can't be civil with me, I have no choice but to go no contact again. He spams my phone to the point where I can't even reply because I have to delete his messages (bad government phone). I tell him about 50 times not to spam me. He doesn't listen. It's back and forth until I again go no contact. The stalking and harassment continues. Then, about 3 and a half months after leaving, all communication on his end stops abruptly. \n\nI hear nothing for one week...then two....then three. I start to panic. Is he okay? Did he get arrested? Did he lose his stuff? Is he okay? One month turns to two. I'm depressed, confused, worried, alone. Then, in the beginning of January, I get called in by my HR manager. He had been left a note by a woman, my ex's mom, with her contact info. Apparently he had recently undergone surgery and was asking for me. I was reluctant, but contacted her. \n\nApparently his \"parasite\" issue was actually severe sepsis, which had resulted in him nearly dying and needing open heart surgery. He was currently in a care facility, clean, and wanting to see me. I agree. It goes AMAZINGLY well. We both cry. He had made me a heart-shaped card booklet with a heartfelt poem. \n\nSince then, we are living together and our relationship is surprisingly healthy. He hasn't laid a hand on me. The verbal abuse is gone. He's no longer addicted to sex. I can speak my mind. I've been VERY observant of his behavior and any red flags or possible masks. The one major thing I've noticed is we can't bring up the past, as he still dislikes that I ghosted him and some of the other  decisions I made. And he has bad memory and can't recall most of what I can, which is even shitter because I remember almost all of it. Hell, I could remember all of it if I really dug deep and dwelled on it. But I don't want to. I want to move on.\n\nThanks for anyone who read all of this.", "subreddit": "NarcissisticAbuse"}

If I remember correctly from what he told me, they were removed from the basketball team and suspended. They certainly deserved a more severe punishment as that was oral rape. Plain and simple.\n\nThis got me looking back at an incident that occurred about 13 or 14 years ago. I'm 24 now, so I would've been 10 or 11 (this guy is two years older than me). A friend of mine who used to be a cousin of mine by marriage and me were hanging out with some friends who lived just down the road from me. We were friends with three of the boys who lived in that house and we spent a lot of time playing in the backyard.\n\nOne day, we were playing on the trampoline there. For some reason, Aaron (my ex-cousin) forced me down in front of the other kids on the trampoline. He then proceeded to whip out his penis and slap me in the face with it. If I remember correctly, everyone else was laughing and I was angry and shocked by it. Of course, I was humiliated too.\n\nI didn't really view it as a huge deal, although it always struck me as really bizarre. We continued to be friends until we just naturally grew apart. In the last couple of years as sexual assault has become more and more of a public topic, I began to wonder if maybe that was sexual assault. It wasn't until tonight after my nephew told me about it that I realized it was.\n\nI don't really know if it traumatized me in any way or not. I have a lot of depression and anxiety issues. I go through periods of very flared up social anxiety. Aside from masturbation, I don't have much of a desire for sexual activity. I'm a virgin and have only had four girlfriends but haven't dated since 2008. I worry sometimes (but with great intensity) that new friends secretly dislike me or are annoyed by me. I've noticed recently that when people touch me from behind it startles me. Once I actually instinctively elbowed a guy in the face when he came up behind me and covered my eyes. After re-contextualizing this event, I've had a little anxiety and a bit of a pit in my stomach, but I'm not in absolute despair.\n\nI don't really know what else to say. I considered making a throwaway account but decided against it. I've told three trusted friends. I also want to clarify that I copied and pasted this from another post I made in another abuse subreddit.\n\nEDIT: I remembered earlier today that in 7th grade, Aaron actually came up to my table at the school cafeteria and  he mockingly asked me if I remembered that time when he slapped me with his wiener.

Because some things have gotten better over time - until it goes back to zero. He goes from that this matters the most, to that nothing about us matters and everything is ruined forever. Its white or black. Never in the middle. - And I love him. Right now he is at the point where he truly thinks this is justified, completely swollowed up in his own ego that nothing beyond that is worth anything. Eventually he'll feel something again. Maybe its love, maybe its regret, maybe years from now its selfreflection. And its always way too late. We have been here before. The other times Ive panicked, freaked out, acted desperate for him to tell me he does love me. I still want to talk to him about it. We live together. He told me he doesn't love me and that he never wants to speak with me again, because he doesn't have to. In a different sort of relationship, you don't have to talk about a breakup either, but it's the right thing to do. Ive learned enough about him, to know thats not the rules he follows.\n\nThe story about him and me, are long and complicated as these relationships goes. Last night I lied to him, and I shouldnt have. I hate lying. He is somewhat a pathological liar, and trust has never really been a functioning thing. I told him it was a lie, and that I am sorry. I wanted to hurt him in that moment, which is true. I wanted to lie and make him feel like shit, like he makes me feel like shit. He leaves me, which is of course hypocritical, since Ive been expected to accept his lies, as well as Ive been blamed for all of them. I make him lie to me, etc. (Imagine if I even dared to do that reverse.) In the past I would freak out and beg for forgiveness, but things are more clear this time. I should feel bad for lying, and I do. But Im not to be blamed for a ruined relationship. Earlier on I would get angry about the unfairness. Why was I feeling this bad, when he seems to feel no guilt at all. I know now that this is not personal. And thats truly what have changed my perspective, that I hope I can hold on to in this transition.\n\nHis cold discard, and empty eyes are because of who he is. Im not being thrown out like trash because Im not worthy of love. I make mistakes but dont deserve this. He is doing this because of his own issues. It doesnt mean it doesnt hurt, being looked at like a stranger by the person who you still feel is your friend and partner messes up so much inside, and is traumatic as hell. Its something I'll probably always have to work with now.\n\nIve only just moved In. I havent even really unpacked. He never really showed interest in it. Didnt make room in the closets for me. I wonder if he ever really meant we were going to try and make a life together. This is the second time Ive moved all my things, furniture, clothes to his place. Last time I got discarded too and had to move. He promised me it wouldnt happen again, and I had to trust him. And here I am again, only short of a year later. My life is all fucked up again, as it has been with the other discards. Im tired of starting over, but will have to this one last time. I know for me this is the last time. I told him before I moved in, this would be the last time. And it has to be. Either we work through it, or its over. There is no more back and forth. Nobody can live well under those conditions. He told me how happy he was that I moved here (different country, so its a big thing for me). Last night he told me he havent been happy in months. Had I known that I wouldnt have moved across borders and willingly put myself in this situation. I dont understand he thinks thats okay to do, twice. I can only imagine how furious he would be was it the other way around. I would get the \"i dont love you fuck off\" talk. We have both been verbally abusive. He is a very severe gaslighter and liar. Troubles with empathy has made this harder, and sexual abuse has occured because of that. That would change forever how I see him though I chose to try to move on with him after. Im trying to look at my own life, and the pattern of our relationship. It is a cycle, and one Ive taken part in, enabled and been a toxic part of myself. And everytime I break down, and neglect aspects of my life worth holding on to, like school, friends and work. Making the relationship work becomes my life. My codependency makes this very hard.\n\nHe is in the other room. And I miss him already. I miss him because he's already not here anymore. And thats a terrible way to feel, that I know everyone here have experienced. You can see their physical body, but everything else is gone. The love in their eyes are gone, and are left with an empty stare that look at you as you are less than human, a ridicoule and embarassedment. I think thats been the hardest part for me, because in someway the person you love dies, you grieve it as someone have died. But they are right there at arms length. If only you could reach out and bring them back. But it doesnt matter what you say or do at this point. Reasoning wont help, it only agitates. You can take the blame for everything. You can beg. You can cry. It doesnt matter, because you are no longer personified. You dont exist to them anymore. They could care less about you. They might come back, when you are moving on but things will never be the same. This time I cant go back to my ghost.\n\nLast night I told him Im in contact with a womenshelter and I think that have made him very angry. Its incredibly upsetting that I qualify to get help at a place like that, and its not really something I wanted for myself, but thats the situation. His way of handling this has only made me more sure that I need that kind of help, so I can find my inner compass again.", "subreddit": "NarcissisticAbuse"}

I saw that she had been horribly emotionally abused and was basically living in a garage. \n\nShe was crying and said she wanted out but didn't have the means to leave the situation and that she just wanted someone to believe in her and that she could get better if she could just get out of the situation. So me being me (read:idiot) I tell her she's not staying there anymore and move her out into an apartment. Which I pay for and let her work for me to cover the costs.\n\nI get my lawyer and my accountant involved and we get her debt under control and get her on a payment plan. I also manage to talk her into going into therapy to help her deal with everything.\n\nDuring this time we become very close friends and she confides a lot in me and I become extremely protective over her. She gives me weekly updates about her progress and how she's working on herself to become a stronger person and that she's staying away from toxic people. I'm extremely proud of her.\n\nExcept, she wasn't. What she had been doing in secret for the better part of the year is using the things I gave her to help the guy that abused her after he got kicked out of his house and his literal crackwhore of a girlfriend left him (he could no longer afford the drugs that kept her around).\n\nI confronted her about it once I found out and all she said was \"he needs my help\". I honestly don't want to keep her in my life anymore. Does that make me a bad person? I'm just tired of the lying. I cut my own salary so I could hire her because I was so disgusted with the conditions she was living in with her young children. I didn't want their lives ruined because of the situation she had gotten herself into and I had hoped by giving her the tools that she would be able to make a good life for herself and her family, but instead she put all of it to the narc and I have no words to express my disappointment.\n\nTL;DR: I spent the better part of a year supporting someone who was horribly abused only to find out I had actually just been funding her narc addiction the entire time.\n\nLast night I find out she's gotten married in secret and put down a deposit on a house that's in his name (basically, she just set that money on fire) and I'm extremely upset about everything.", "subreddit": "NarcissisticAbuse"}

(He was my first boyfriend or anything else and I married him). Even when he was in the psych ward for a week for one of his many suicide threats, he would cry on the phone to me every single day. He insisted I visit as frequently as possible. During our most recent fights, when I suggest maybe trying a trial separation he tells me that if he leaves, he's not coming back. Then he says that he'll go live in the woods and die of exposure if I kick him out. He used to tell me that he would burn down the house with himself inside (because who cares if his kids have a home, right?). \n\nHe used to tell me that if he didn't have a threesome by the time he was 30 that he would kill himself. In my late 20s I managed to seduce a friend from work and we ended up being in polyamorous relationship for a few months. That's how and why I was finally able to admit to myself that I'm bi. When I went to the pride festival a few years ago, (by myself because he's homophobic of gay men/trans people) he called me and asked why I had been gone so long. I told him I found an old friend there, someone I babysat almost 20 years prior. I was hanging out with said friend and her brother, whom I also babysat, arrived. I was having a good time catching up and got ANOTHER phone call. He said he couldn't hear me with \"all of those dicks in my mouth\" (I was in a noisy restaurant) and that if I wasn't home in the next hour that he would barricade the door shut, then hung up. I was gone for a total of 2 or maybe 3 hours. If he sees me typing a lot, he'll casually walk past and look at my phone or just straight up ask who I'm typing so much at. If I try to go out to dinner or a movie with a friend, he tries to tag along. Says he doesn't get out of the house enough. He tells lies to get out of social interactions with his friends (whom he later talks trash about) and uses me as the excuse. \"Anonoods says I can't. Sorry!\" He chooses to remain unemployed, while I support the family. He constantly asks for new video games, alcohol, weed, other stuff for various hobbies, etc. He only recently (within the last year or two) started doing chores and cooking food after I mentioned divorce during a few arguments. He now uses that against me during arguments, saying \"I've been trying so hard! I've gotten so much better than I used to be!\" as if that justifies the ways in which he is still awful. He yells at the kids over accidents or forgetting things. Minor things. Things that don't need be be yelled about. Sweeping the floor around the litter boxes, spilling something, or forgetting to throw away a candy wrapper, for example. My oldest child wants to move in with grandma once reaching adulthood because he's so mean to her. He's way harder on her than he is on my youngest. He puts holes in my doors and walls when he's mad at me, even though I bought him a punching bag so he wouldn't do that sort of thing anymore. He's manipulative - he'll withhold affection to get what he wants. If he asks for a game, or anything else, and I say no, he'll go to bed. Even at 2 pm. Until and unless I cave. He's always going on about how much smarter he is than everyone else. He thinks so highly of himself, while simultaneously putting himself down and fishing for compliments. Years ago he mentioned the fine, peach fuzz sort of hair on my upper lip. He told me that the way my stomach hangs down during sex grosses him out, because of all the stretch marks (from bearing HIS CHILDREN!). He mentioned something about me having a double chin. Things that stuck in my mind for years, that I still feel subconscious about to this day. Things that other people have assured me I DON'T need to be worried about. Any time he actually DOES leave the house, he comments about all the ladies that were staring at him and/or his crotch. \n\nDuring our most recent argument I told him that he's a narc. He didn't know what that was and when I showed him the definition he accused me of being one. He likes to use my memory problems against me during arguments. I have a lot of trouble with forgetting things (I'm told ADD, anxiety and depression can all cause memory issues). If I can't recall EXACTLY what he said/did, I shouldn't be upset about it. If I'm upset he accuses me of being on my period, PMSing or even just \"being crazy\". \n\nHe HAS gotten much better than he was... he stopped using pills, doesn't play his loud, annoying video games or musical equipment much, when I'm home. He doesn't let me do ALL the work, chores, cooking and child rearing completely on my own anymore. He does a little under the table work during the warmer months. He doesn't threaten suicide anymore (used to be weekly). He's cut back on drinking. I just don't know if it's too little, too late. I need a break. A vacation. ME time. And I just can't get it. Not even on the table for discussion. Any time I even try to mention a separation, he goes back on the defensive and tries to guilt trip me and make me feel sorry for him because he has no car, no money and \"nowhere to go\" (because he's too proud to stay with his mother).

They've ended up getting together and now they're virtually inseparable. But I'm seriously starting to worry for the girl because I'm starting to get suspicious about the guy.\n\nBackground on him: we first met and initially hit it off really well. We suddenly got very close very quickly (red flag in hindsight), but then he suddenly distanced himself a bit. We were able to still be friends after I managed to calm down my triggered abandonment anxieties, but it still didn't seem completely normal. Then he met the girl he's currently with. They got very close very quickly and they're still basically attached at the hip. What makes me worry about him are small instances of things I know to look out for after my own dealings with narcs. \n\nFor example: he convinced me to leave my old group and join his new one due to some drama where imo both sides weren't completely innocent. I still keep in touch with the old group, but I had a hard time switching since I've known them for a bit. He basically tried telling me that they haven't done anything to support or 'value' me and that I was making the right choice 'since I know my worth now'. I still expressed that I was struggling with it and how does this 'supportive friend' react? He tells me to calm down. He tried to be manipulative and then went right for 'you need to calm down' when that didn't fully work.\n\nAnd even more recently was an even bigger flag: there's this girl who he really liked despite her basically stringing him along. He eventually got fed up and blew up at her, but they still talk. As it turns out, she got assaulted pretty badly. I could've sworn when he told me about it, he said something to the effect of 'karma' and 'she really regrets going to her cousin's now' (half jokingly), and 'despite what she did to me (??!), she didn't deserve that'. \n\nSmall, fleeting moments like that make me all sorts of uncomfortable.

Because we broke up, I had been so excited to be home for Christmas (for the first time in five years!). And I still hope to be home for Christmas. But I've been too weak to outright tell her no; partially because it feels selfish, partially because I know she'll blame my family for slandering her, and partially because I am afraid of what she will say when I do tell her no. \n\nFor the last week (and upcoming week) she has been on a cruise in the Caribbean. She's having a great time and that has translated into her being really nice to me. The last few days have felt...good. But last night I did something bad and it's eating me up inside. She went tanning yesterday and ended up slightly burnt. She said it wasn't too bad, but her chest was definitely pink. I offered my sympathies and asked how pink. In response, she sent me an almost completely naked picture of herself, saying that that was easier than describing it. \n\nI know this may not seem big to many of you, but in all the time I've known her she has been extremely against the idea of sending anything even slightly revealing. My love language is physical/sexual affection and I've mentioned before that I like the idea of getting stuff like that. But she's always refused. Once she sent me a picture of herself when she tried on a bathing suit but the moment she made a decision she told me to delete it and watched me do so. Obviously when she sent the picture last night it took me totally by surprise. This morning, however, she made a comment about how it was a fair deal that I get pictures like that one in exchange for my spending Christmas with her. I feel horrible, like I've misled her into sending something she wouldn't have otherwise sent. I know I need to tell her and plan on doing so today, but it doesn't change that I feel like a monster now. \n\nHas anyone else been in similar circumstances? Am I as bad as I think?", "subreddit": "NarcissisticAbuse"}

I thought \"ok, this guy is taking accountability, great...perhaps some feminist views too? awesome. BOY WAS I WRONG. (He's a raging misogynistic demon who hates his mother)\n\nAfter those smaller scale disagreements came his first big test which I shared with y'all this week about how he tried to convince me that he might have an std which he started going on about AFTER he convinced me to have unprotected sex with him. He said \"I guess you're done with me now?\" LORD WHY DID I NOT SAY \"YES I AM YOU SICK FUCK!!???\" I SOMEHOW FORGAVE HIM SMH\n\nWell after this I guess it showed him that I didn't value myself that much because why would anyone stay with someone after that? \n\nSteady after that happened whenever I brought up things I didnt like I would get dismissed, straight up DISMISSED y'all!

And I'd be the one apologising to HIM in the end!\n\nThen for the next year after that I was trained to not say anything when I felt angry about something because I was always the one that was in the wrong for having valid feelings.

I might actually be really quiet because we are having a silly argument like what product to buy in a shop and I try to explain why we need it and he will say \u2018don\u2019t make a scene.\u2019 I don\u2019t mean like frivolous spending, I mean because he doesn\u2019t mop the floors so he would never consider buying floor cleaner so I have to justify it. When he says I\u2019m shouting, I end up shouting no matter how hard I try because it makes me angry when he makes me out as some monster. \n\nHe always seems so perfect. He\u2019s quiet, he has a good job, he seems normal.\n\nIt\u2019s happened gradually. First it was when he saw someone when we were..well anywhere. Like a girl he knew in a shop or a friend he bumped into when we were together. He would drop my hand and speak to them like I wasn\u2019t there.\n\nAt first I thought, we don\u2019t know each other well maybe he\u2019s not ready to say girlfriend. But now it\u2019s 10 years later and I\u2019m thinking maybe he\u2019s not ready to say I\u2019m his wife. \n\nThe ignoring happened here and there, then every time we ran into someone. \n\nNow I\u2019m sitting in a bus stop because I had to get some air. \n\nAll day he ignores me. We could be having a normal conversation and whatever was the key information it would be up to me to remind him what I said. He couldn\u2019t find his sock or his laptop or his numerous cables, now can\u2019t use the washing machine and doesn\u2019t know how to turn it on or read a simple text that says \u2018rapid\u2019 and push it. It doesn\u2019t matter how many times I show him or tell him.\n\nNext it was things like when I speak he would look through me. I do something similar though, I have ptsd from a rape as a teen and after a head injury experience what appear to be tiny tiny seizures here and there. It\u2019s like I\u2019m there but then I\u2019m not, just for a second. So I always excuse him. I mean it must drive him nuts when I miss bits and pieces of conversations every now and then. \n\nThen it\u2019s full sentences. Today he ignored me twice in front of his brother while we decorated our new home. Simple things. Things he could easily have said \u2018no\u2019 to or \u2018give me a minute I\u2019m busy.\u2019\n\nWhen I am fed up of being ignored all day and having to repeat myself (like my Nan to my deaf grandad...it\u2019s constant all day necessary things. \n\nSometimes I stop responding. I\u2019m aware it can\u2019t help but it gives me time to consider what is happening to me. It then it makes me look like the bad guy.\n\nWhen he\u2019s ignoring me he will go to the toilet and pretend he\u2019s poking for 20-45mins. I know, men poo a lot and for long, but I\u2019m 30 years old and I know what it sounds like when he is poking because he does it everyday. This is just silent punishment where I\u2019m locked from speaking to him. I literally can\u2019t get a response to a question and sometimes I need my own space. Just a few mins to walk by myself and clear my head. I\u2019m not allowed to be outside alone it seems.\n\nIt turns into a manhunt and I have to leave and ask him not to make a scene just so I can be outside. \n\nI don\u2019t actually leave the house unless I am with him so when this happens it\u2019s like a touch of freedom. It makes me so anxious to go outside and I don\u2019t even know why. I might go to the shop when he needs milk and has requested it but otherwise it\u2019s become difficult unless I\u2019m ignored for so long I need to hear the rain or my feet on the ground. \n\nI managed to skip away, it\u2019s been 13mins, probably 13 days of ignoring since the last time I tried to beg him to stop.\n\nHe ignores me for a while and now he\u2019s calling me so that means it\u2019s time to give myself up. Go home. \n\nIt happened when I was young with my mum. She would tell me she didn\u2019t care and kick me out and I\u2019d be shoeless and wandering the streets but manage to find a friend to let me stay and suddenly there would be police looking for me because her beloved child is missing. I would always be really confused when they would return me, shoeless and cold and she would open out her arms or there would be 999 missed calls after wasting my battery trying to find a warm place to stay til she calmed down. \n\nGod I hope he doesn\u2019t call the police. It\u2019s only 16mins now but he will run around looking for me like he\u2019s some hero. I just don\u2019t get why he always likes me to make him look good and me bad. I just like to be outside sometimes.\n\nAm I crazy?", "subreddit": "NarcissisticAbuse"}

Some are more pathological liars then others, some are in a solid state of denial that they will go to the grave with what lie they have told and WILL never go back on it! \nIn my sad case, my (F35) exNar was an extreme case and must have other undiagnosed and untreated mental conditions. So I was never getting the truth out her EVER! \nYou could catch her fucking a creep in your bedroom and she would look at me and say \"I don't know what your talking about\" and then you could say... But wait, I have you on video... and she would say\" that footage was from before I met you\" or whatever, I never caught her IN THE BED... but the point was made... Total denial, total gaslighting... \n\nSo really the only way I could ever have any kind of idea what was happening was when she accused me. I started figuring her out a lot more when things started making sense. \nAlso another thing I noticed was when she got really sarcastic and made it like it was outrageous... it really happened!!! For example...\"yeah while you were gone for 10 mins to get coffee creamer I had the neighbor over for a quickie\"\nI had no proof at the time, but that sarcasm WAS IN FACT MY EX-NARC's straight confession! I later found out that there was someone there while I was out getting the coffee creamer she begged me to get, otherwise she wouldn't have enough time to put on her make-up and be late to work! She doesn't even know that I KNOW and never will because after that along with a few other major things I had no choice but to NC her toxic ass for good! \n\nAmazing how she unconsciously let's out the truths. That's the devil's confession working in mysterious ways. \nI do believe that the devil gets inside these people when they were at the hands of their animal abusers, mostly as children. A narcissist is the outcome and reminder of evil existing. I know evil now unfortunately at it's purest form and it's scary when they are in your life. But you also know what to look out for, so I guess that's like the ONLY good thing that you can take.... Defensive measures to not put yourself in harm's way ever again. \n\nWould love to hear if anyone got their confessions by means of accusations or sarcastic, outrageous references? \nBlew my mind that I was able to put some of those pieces together, after I knew how to catch at least some of what she did to me and my kids. \n\nThanks for reading everyone!", "subreddit": "NarcissisticAbuse"}

You believe them when they say, \"no-one can love you like I can\". \n\nHe was so sweet to me. Treated me like a princess and said the most beautiful thinga to me when he was around. Told me I was the most special and beautiful thing in the world. Promised me he would marry me and we would have the most beautiful life together. \n\nThe first time he ghosted me I was worried sick and it made me feel crazy.  I thought since he was deployed he was in real trouble. 3-4 months later he said he couldn't deal with his problems well and didn't want to burden me. I accepted this answer. \n\nThe birthdays and holidays he disappeared too. Same answer, and because I loved him, I trusted him. \n\nThe ghosting became more frequent. Its obvious now, he was growing bored of mirroring me. \n\nThen I became pregnant. I was very happy. I loved him dearly, and I was proud. \n\nHe told me if I didnt get an abortion he would leave me and if I kept the baby he wouldn't support us. He was a naval officer, he could have easily.  I didn't know what to do. He promised he would be there for me and we could have another baby \"when the time was right\". I was scared and alone. He wasn't there for me when I did it.  I was alone. \n\nI quit my job of 7 years because of the depression and shame. I now work a shitty call center job I loathe. I cried every day. I still do for my baby. \n\nTook about 6-8 months of hovering and gas lighting but then he ghosted me again. I was really alone. \n\nI stayed away for 3 months; I got tired of begging him to love me the way he says he does. Tired of asking for the promises he made. \n\nI thought this was the worst pain I could ever feel, giving up my baby and losing the love of my life, until I found out about the other women. The women he was doing the same thing to when we met, and all through our relationship. He never used condoms and to think of all of the women he was with and then me makes feel disgusting. Then the vasectomy. He led me on in between the ghosting for about year telling me what I wanted to hear about having another baby. \n\nI am 33 years old, that is a cruel thing to do to anyone, especially a woman of advanced maternal age. What if I dont have the chance to have another baby? It breaks my heart. \n\nI am emotionally scarred. I have gained 60lbs from the pregnancy and depression, and I have serve PTSD.

Needing advice", "author": "middaystaticmusic", "self_text": "Reddit, I need your help. \n\nI\u2019m coming to realizations that I\u2019ve been the victim of narcissistic abuse, and that my ex girlfriend is a covert narcissist specifically. \n\nI\u2019ll start from the beginning but try to keep it short and comment any details you all may have questions on to help me figure this thing out. \n\nBack in August I met a beautiful, charming, somewhat shy but also social woman. We talked for a few weeks before finally meeting and hitting it off. We then talked for another few weeks and then went on a very nice date which I preceded to ask her to be mine and without hesitation she said yes. \n\nThings were going amazing, too good. I truly was in love, and she claimed the same. Saying things like \u201cyou\u2019re my person\u201d \u201cmaybe we\u2019re soulmates\u201d etc. \n\nAbout a month later another woman I briefly saw but then just became good friends with showed up at one of my bands gigs where my new girlfriend was. \n\nShe was destroyed by this even though my friend and I didn\u2019t even look each other in the eye in fear of hurting her or causing drama. I was always open to my girlfriend about this friend and it wasn\u2019t a problem until then. \n\nBit by bit things unraveled and I was given the silent treatment various times until she did finally break up with me saying \u201cwe moved too fast, she ruins everything, she needed to work on herself because she has insecurities she needs to work on\u201d\nI let her go, saying I wished her the best and truly meant it. It was clean cut. \n\nShe still would reach out and want to talk. We even had sex a few times after the break up. Until she saw a Facebook post I made the night she broke things off that simply said \u201cI know my worth\u201d and that set her ablaze..\n\nHateful screaming phone calls saying \u201cI hate you\u201d calling me stupid etc. \n\nA huge chain of texts wanting me to forget about her, delete her naked pictures and just kept going and going until the next day she claimed to have hurt herself physically. She then \u201ccalmed down\u201d and said she had no energy to fight. I didn\u2019t either so I just let it go, she then said I could \u201ccome over if you want..\u201d\n\nAfraid that she was hurting herself I did. She bawled in my arms for hours in her dark room and proceeded to thank me for being someone who was truly there for her no matter what. \n\nThen after weeks of playing cat and mouse she said some cold things that finally made me say \u201cscrew this\u201d and I left her with a long text saying how I felt about the situation but in a calm and straight forward manner and proceeded to block her on everything including her number. \n\nShe text me from a text app almost immediately saying she was going to come over but I\u2019m basically not worth the energy and she\u2019s thankful for the memories. \n\nAnd that was it..I kept my cool and went no contact for 3 weeks until this last thanksgiving, she text me from another text app being vague and saying happy thanksgiving etc. I was baited back in and she said all the things I wanted to hear about missing me, how much she loved me, how our memories where her happiest she\u2019s had. Yet she didn\u2019t want to get back together. We even had sex the day after thanksgiving if that means anything. \n\nHere I am a few weeks later and feeling like a fool. I\u2019ve allowed her to love bomb me and I\u2019m turn I truly love her so I\u2019ve done things to \u201csupply\u201d her. \n\nThen out of nowhere she \u201ccrept on my Facebook\u201d and saw that I basically wasn\u2019t letting the break up hold me down. Was talking to female friends and enjoying life. Whatever she saw something set her off again and she deleted me from Snapchat and proceeded to tell me she needed to take a step back again and focus on herself. \n\nShe\u2019s apologized for many things and seemed sincere, she\u2019s still saying she loves me and whether we end up together or not wants to just know I\u2019m okay and cares about me supposedly. \n\nWe\u2019ve still been texting but no I\u2019m person contact. She will be distant at times and at times love bombing again. \n\nI\u2019m very confused as to what is happening. \n\nI can\u2019t tell if she is in fact a covert narcissist or just an insecure fragile woman that doesn\u2019t want to be with me yet can\u2019t seem to let it go. \n\nWhat course of actions are best here? \nWhat can I do to still try and be caring yet not give her the supply she craves? \n\nThank you for any advice and help.

When I was 24 I met my Narcissist but I had no clue. It was the late 1980's. I had met him through a mutual friend. We hung out at the bar and talked one evening for a few hours. Then I met him for a coffee. So we had seen each other two times. Then he asked me out on an official ate. He arrived at my door, looking all sheepish with a card in hand. I opened it. It said I love you. I felt a twist in my stomach and what was \"that voice\" whispered this isn't right. I ignored it. He looked like he didn't want to be rejected and so I accepted it. He read me well.\n\nWe dated for 3 years, engaged after 9 months. There were SO many warning signs, but I ignored them because he was the underdog, the victim, he told me story after story of being hard done by. His father lined him up against a wall with a hammer in hand and saying to him and his other brothers \"okay whose going to get it\". He went to Adult Children of Alcoholics with me (now that I think of it I don't fucking know why because he had no parent that was alcoholic, but I did). It was for the attention, ofcourse.\n\nWe fought and then I'd apologize. He was addicted to porn and joined sexhaholics anonymous. He couldn't help himself, he had a \"illness\". He deadbedroomed me time and time and time again. It was all about control. He made me think I was the problem, that I had to go to counselling. His head was on a swivel and whenever we'd go out he'd be checking out other women all-the-time. He quite his job. He didn't pay his taxes for three years. He threw us into bankruptcy and poverty. He told me to ask my Mom for money because his Dad (who was just like him) wouldn't give him any and neither would his Mom (on welfare). His Dad was filthy rich by the way and his parents were divorced. \n\nHe wouldn't do housework well so I wouldn't ask him to do it again. He didn't take care of our dogs properly and abused my shepherd - I caught him assaulting her and THAT almost did it. I was SO ANGRY. But, like the good permanent victim he is he blamed it on his childhood, his abusive father, who didn't pay alimony to his mother so after 5 years she just packd up the kids and left the on the father's doorstep and left. Blah, blah, blah. He knew how to manipulate me, where I hurt, what I needed to hear. \n\nI married him. For 13 years we were together. I finally woke up and divorced him in 2001 and I STILL DREAM ABOUT HIM!!! The damage he did, he fucked me up so bad, I didn't know which way was up, who was safe, who wasn't, that I didn't trust myself. I was an emotional wreck and I developed C-PTSD though I didn't realize it at the time. I was able to recover to some degree because I got my life back together, went university (he wouldn't let me do this) and met a beautiful, loving, kind man. BUT IS STILL DREAM ABOUT HIM and the emotional damage, the alienation of affection, the cruelty, the financial violence, the lies, the lies, the lies, cheating, plugging into me and draining my life force until I had to quit my job (I was working two jobs because we could NEVER get out from under the bills that HE accumulated). I could go on and on and on. It's the same story we all have. \n\nHe found me, figured out where I hurt, where I lacked love and then gave me that, alternating then raking that wound open constantly, and, he enjoyed it.\n\nThat was 18 years ago. 18 years ago I divorced him and I STILL DREAM ABOUT HIM. If you are in a relationship with a narcissist, there is no hope for it. You MUST leave and the sooner the better, the less damage you'll have to clean up. I've spent thousands and thousands of dollars in counselling and health care. Now I have C-PTSD due to being in a relationship where the man I love, his family were a nest of narcissists, the mother a full blown psychopath. I thought we could deal with it but after 18 years, the damage has been immense. Me and the love of my life are now in couple's counselling because of his narcissistic family. Narcississts destroy - your - life. There is no safe way to be in relationship with them. \n\nThose like us, with a conscience, with a kind and caring heart, we don't stand a chance. The safest way to deal with a narcissist is to LEAVE AND NEVER SPEAK TO THEM AGAIN.  \n\nSo if you KNOW you are in a relationship with a narcissist get help to get yourself out of there, whatever it takes. I'm 56 and I met my narc when I was 24 - I left when I was 37. Don't do what I did, don't stay, don't listen to the sob stories and don't try to fix him or her. They are what they are, like the story of the frog and the scorpion. If you've never heard of it, google it. Stories exist like this for a reason. THEY DON'T CHANGE AND NEVER WILL, but you can, and in doing so, you will create a beautiful life for yourself and they will be the pieces of shit that they are.

{"post_id": "eaysxk", "created_utc": 1576415660, "title": "Does this sound like emotional abuse or am I overreacting?", "author": "nrs1987", "self_text": "My boyfriend and I have been together almost 4 years now but have known one another for close to 8 years in total. Before we got together we were good friends. During this time he had an on and off girlfriend of close to 10 years. She was overbearing, manipulative, condescending, jealous, etc. She treated him like absolute garbage but because of the nature and length of their ongoing \u201crelationship\u201d I believe he had become codependent by the time we met. \n\nAs his friend, I learned a lot about him over the years. His relationship issues, his health issues, previous struggles with addictions and mental health concerns. He was very aware of all these things. He showed so much potential to overcome them, he just didnt have the appropriate support system in his personal relationships (both family and romantic) \n\nFast forward from that mess to when he and I actually got together. We had been friends for several years, we had the same hobbies, enjoyed the same music, everything seemed like we would be the perfect match. I knew about his previous relationships and he knew about mine.  He was still in the beginning stages of overcoming addiction, he had gotten help for mental health concerns and he had finally had enough of his yo-yo relationship with his ex.  \nWe hung out a few times, and eventually just ended up becoming a couple after spending so much time together. \n\nIt was great for the first 6ish months. Then slowly, his anger began to rise to the surface. As if he had kept it hidden the entire time. He was frustrated more often, his depression seemed progressively worse week after week. As the seasons changed and the world got colder, so did he. On top of his standard depression he was experiencing Seasonal affective disorder. Combine that with his addiction therapy and he was unpleasant to say the least. \n\nHaving come from a family with mental health issues as well as a long line of addicts, I felt that this behaviour he was executing was a result of trying to overcome these obstacles. He needed my support. So I ignored the signs and kept moving forward. At this point, the outbursts were just small, kept at bay by the antidepressant medication. \n\nOnce the seasonal depression wore off, everything was back to normal. Just basic depression that was being treated via medication and the addiction therapy. (Also treated by medication) we enjoyed months of outdoor activities, had a healthy relationship. No fights, no arguments, a healthy dialogue if there was something bothering us and he began tapering his dosage of medication down (the addiction one, not the antidepressant)  we were in a good place and he knew I was there for him.  \n\nWinter rolls around again. The season follows the same pattern as the one prior to that. But knowing what I know from the previous year, I\u2019m more equipped to handle it.  Over the next few months, He begins to get increasingly frustrated with where he is in life. Begins comparing his accomplishments or lack there of to his friends who own homes and have families. His depression and self esteem gets worse. \u201cHis life sucks, his job sucks, our apartment sucks, his car sucks, everything sucks, he has debt and is in a hole he can\u2019t get out of\u201d \n\nSummer comes, all is well. Occasional little outbursts but not that severe.  Doing incredible work on overcoming that addiction and beginning to talk to his doctor about lowering his antidepressant dosage. I\u2019m so proud of his progress.  \n\nThe days get shorter and the cold pushes in. With the cold brings his misery. At this point I\u2019m used to it. But this year it gets worse than I\u2019ve ever seen him. He begins to blame me exclusively for everything bad in his life. He\u2019s sick? My fault. Broke? My fault. Shit job? My fault. Slipped and fell in the snow? My fault. Hungry? My fault. Sad? My fault..... literally everything was my fault. \n\nEarlier that year, a late family member left me a small inheritance. With that money, I paid both of our debts, and made some purchases, new entertainment items... etc.  \nSo one day he lashes out at me. Tell me I\u2019m \u201cignorant, selfish and inconsiderate\u201d that I \u201cdon\u2019t give a shit about him and only think of myself\u201d and that I\u2019m a \u201cfucking bitch and he was better off without me\u201d (this is all a result of him being tired and hungry) \n\nThis was when I started to realize that maybe his outbursts weren\u2019t 100% a result of his medications and health issues. That maybe he was just toxic, maybe I should run for the hills. I started looking for a new apartment, began throwing out things I didn\u2019t think I would need and discreetly packing up some of my belongings. A few days later he apologized. \n\nThe following year, the outbursts started becoming more frequent. There was less time in between them. They were slowly becoming a year round occurrence. The blaming became worse and year round. Nothing I could do was or is ever good enough. Maybe it\u2019s because he\u2019s essentially off of all the medication now? Maybe it\u2019s because he\u2019s feeling like he wants to have fun again now that he\u2019s out of his major depressive funk and feels like I\u2019m holding him back from living his best life. Maybe he just used me for the support I offered and now that he\u2019s medication free, he doesn\u2019t need or want me anymore.  Who knows. \n\nI\u2019m just so exhausted now. I don\u2019t know what to do. It\u2019s winter again. It\u2019s getting worse again. I have no family, I have nowhere to run to. But I don\u2019t think it\u2019s healthy for me to do this anymore. I\u2019m afraid of confronting him because whenever I tell him how I feel, his response is that I\u2019m pathetic or overreacting. I\u2019ve literally done everything I possibly can. I just want to run off in the night any never look back but I can\u2019t leave everything I own behind. \n\nI know this is not a healthy relationship. I know I need to do the right thing and walk away. But how do you walk away when you\u2019ve been broken to the point that you don\u2019t know who you are anymore? How do you walk away when you\u2019ve invested so much of yourself into someone else that there is no strength left in you?  \n\nSorry this was so long.... I need advice.

It began with love bombing and I thought this was everything I wanted. I didn't see the red flags in the beginning and I dove headfirst which was my mistake.

It became a cycle where we would argue and he would call me names and Id be hurt but then he would come back.  It escalated to him calling me worse things further on. I have been there for this guy through the process of medical school and was emotionally supportive through many hard times. Through his first year I spent a lot of time traveling and visiting him and when i would ask him if he would visit me he used the excuse that he was too consumed with medical school. ( I was in pharmacy school). Finally, during this past summer he decided to break it off with me because apparently I was fighting with him too much. He ended it through text, and went on a verbal tirade calling me garbage etc. It hasnt been 5 months and he recently told me he was talking to someone new at his med school. It completely tore me apart with the healing I have been working on. Not only did I feel like i never mattered and what I did for him was never appreciated, but now that he got into med school and was well on his way to becoming a doctor that he discarded me like i was nothing.

They went home that same night.\n\nDecember 13th I wake up and feel fine, nothings wrong, no parts of my body hurt aside from the usual knee pain, but I'm good.\n\nOn December 14th I woke up and I felt fine until I went to the bathroom. The pain I felt was identical to penetrative pain from a lack of lube or being to rough to early and not giving my body time to relax, but from my beginners experience using toys and understanding how to control my body I also recognized the pain of being forcefully entered.\n\nToday is December 15th and I checked again and the pain is still there. In the past when I would mess up during my own private time I would feel fine by the next day, but for it to have lasted an entire day and into the next is crazy to me. I tried inserting a finger in and it went in like I had used a toy 2 nights ago.\n\nNow on the night between the 13th and 14th I had used no toys on myself, I didn't even touch myself that night. I've used my toys enough to recognize how my body responds to the activities and in the days following and I'm uncomfortably confident in what I think happened.\n\nNow I have had a history of being sexually abused in the past. Between 3-9 I was molested by an older cousin, 8-15 I was touched inappropriately by my biological father, 15-17 I was molested and raped by a girlfriend and groomed by a 27-28 year old Canadian and a 17-18 year old Swede.\n\nMy ex-gf who raped me did so anally on one occasion and that occasion along with the third and final time left me a body memory of pressure around my wrists, but no body memory was left from the time mentioned above.\n\nThe only people in the house on this night were my step-dad, my mom, and my step-sister.\n\nI highly doubt that it was my mom just because I've spent the majority of my life with her and never experienced any sexual abuse from here. \n\nIdk how I feel about the idea of it being my step-dad since I'm unsure if he can even get aroused anymore and how I'm a trans-woman.

The main thing is that she is rich but doesn\u2019t wanna hand out money to her son since she paid in full his entire Ivy League college.

We were in a LTR for over five years and have been broken up for several months.\n\nSome context: He strongly resisted moving out of the house I own, so I\u2019ve been hopping around a bunch (traveling, staying with family and friends, etc.). I\u2019ve finally convinced him to move out at the end of the month. This, however, means that we\u2019ve been in touch throughout the breakup so far because I\u2019m essentially his landlady.\n\nNow that he\u2019s about to move out, he\u2019s trying to \u201cfight for us,\u201d in his words. He says he\u2019ll do anything to get back together, and while I\u2019m grieving the relationship we had, I\u2019m trying to keep all the red flags in mind:\n\n-He\u2019d constantly tell me he didn\u2019t believe my intentions. Often, he\u2019d say I was \u201cmaking my feelings up\u201d or \u201cfake crying\u201d to manipulate him.\n\n-He used to call me a bitch and a cunt all the time. I told him I found that wildly inappropriate, so for the last few years of our relationship he would just tell me to go fuck myself instead.\n\n-He would never hit me directly but got physical in other ways (i.e., pushing my chair, throwing my phone against the windshield while I drove, wrapping me in a sheet and dragging me off the bed, smashing things, taking photos of me while we fought and then calling me ugly, etc.). Once he threw a drill against the wall, and it ricocheted and hit my leg.\n\n-He doesn\u2019t have much of a relationship with his family, and he spent time with friends (excluding the double-dates I set up) maybe once or twice in the last year of our relationship. When I traveled alone or went out with friends while we were together, he would accuse me of \u201calways flitting around\u201d or \u201cneglecting things at home.\u201d (Mind you, we don\u2019t have kids, I make double what he makes, and the house is in my name only because he couldn\u2019t contribute a cent to the down payment. I spotted him money more times than I could count during our relationship.)\n\nToday he\u2019s telling me he still loves me. He\u2019s begging me to reconsider severing ties, and he\u2019s asking me to go to therapy with him so we can work on \u201crebuilding what we had.\u201d\n\nBad idea, right? I know it is. I\u2019m about to sell my house, sign a lease in another state, start fresh, etc. And this is what\u2019s scaring him. So I guess I just need strangers on the internet to tell me that ending things was the right decision. Because right now, knowing that we\u2019re about to go full-on no-contact, it hurts a ton. And I miss the good times and the closeness, despite all the toxicity. \n\nNote: I\u2019m embarrassed to have posted about our breakup in here about a year ago; we ended up getting back together, and I really don\u2019t want to let that happen again.

She never had sexual intercourse in her life and was very insecure about me having a 4 years long relationship before meeting her, ending up being downright controlling at times. It eventually got way,way, better after a lot of discussions and reassuring her. Before her, I had a few relationships, never LDR, never neuroatypical, never without frequent physical intimacy\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI quickly noticed something was weird about some of her behaviors and was convinced she was on the spectrum. She had consulted multiple psychologist before but never got a diagnosis and I turned out to be right about that after she saw an autism specialist who was absolutely positive about her being aspie. She was also a victim of sexual abuse when she was young. Physical intimacy is very complicated for her.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBecause of that, we didnt really have a sex life. Things were going very very slow (IE: It took us basically one year just to kiss), but since I really loved her I never ever pressured her about anything, and was fine with that, even tho I really would love to cuddle more often.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n3 Month ago, she moved far from her parents (who used to help her a lot in daily activities) for her studies, in a city where she doesnt know anyone and which is even further from me (6 hours of bus instead of 3). She then asked if she could go on tinder to look for girls. I knew she had girlfriends in the past so this didnt surprise me.I would have prefered an exclusive relationship but she assured me it would just be physical, to explore things, as she didnt have any sexual experiences, and that it would feel safer to her since she was abused by a man. She was very thankful to me for letting her try this, and told me it wouldnt change anything in our relationship, since i was her boyfriend and would stay that way.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAfter 1 Month, she met a girl (lets call her Jane) and soon became close with her. It was difficult but I was eventually able to accept it. She ended kissing her 2 weeks ago. They havent went further then that yet (it is extremely hard for her to lie even for minor things so I trust her on that). I am still somehow afraid that she ends up replacing me, seeing how fast things are going compared to how it was with me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThey basically see each other once a week now (compared to the once a month at best i see her). Since she has absolutely no friends in this city, struggles a lot to make some, and is alone most of the time, I can understand this and i try to never bother her when they are together. She however would never be fine with me having this kind of relationship with another woman.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSince she moved in this city, I'm the only one who travel so we can see each other. Again, i understand because taking the bus for her is very stressful (they are always late, they involves physical proximity for extended periods of time with strangers, and she got a pretty bad experience with one driver sending an sms alert wrongfully and making her miss the bus) Every time I come, I help them with chores/ groceries shopping/ her homeworks and we tend to have less physical intimacy than before because she is always tired. We do however make sure to have a little time for enjoying each other each time by going out to a museum, a restaurant etc...\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe is very reliant on me for her work bc she also has severe dyslexia and her studies involves a lot of writing AND non explicit statements by teachers who can't seem to grasp at all that she needs clear directions as an aspie girl. She is subject to very strong anxiety crisis and I support her emotionaly every time she has a work due. I even wrote once basically the whole thing for her.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n2 weeks ago, I Had this massive week of work, far from my hometown, that was very important to my career. I was exhausted at the end but she had an important exam right after and so I did 12 hours of bus to see her instead of coming home. I went on cleaning her appartement, correcting her spelling mistakes, reassuring her when she felt down etc. Again, we didnt do anything sexually bc she was tired and stressed out.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAfter I went back home, I had a catastrophic situation at work and became very distressed. : had a huge amount of work to do for monday and any mess up would damage my carreer. Told her i needed her emotionnaly to support me this weekend and she basically said it would be difficult for her bc of how tired she was. She then nonetheless procedeed to be kind and supportive.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAs i woke up this morning, she told me she would see Jane for diner tonight (and that she might sleep at her appartement) but that she would watch her phone if i needed anything. It felt so unfair to me as she was basically tired for me but not for her, and I needed her very bad on this particular night, and she knew this. Her reasonning is that since she can't help me on my work it wouldnt change anything for me if she was eating with someone instead of on her own while texting me. (it does, everytimes she is with Jane she takes one hour to respond to anything)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI spoke to her about how i felt and she got very mad, and exagerated the whole thing pretending i was asking her to be entirely devoted to me (even tho i allow a one sided open relationship basically) She sent a message to cancel her date but is angry and refuse to talk to me now. I didnt ask her to do that but honestly didnt expect her AT ALL to plan such a thing at such a time in the first place. I felt shitty for ruining her evening and having her change the day she had planned which is a great source of stress, but this is litteraly the first time in two years i had her cancel one thing for me. She also can see Jane basically anytime since she lives 15 minutes away from her. AND as i write this, in the end Jame still came for \"5 minutes\" (been one hour already) bc she \"had a bad day yersterday\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI trust her when she tells me she loves me ; I however feel like i Am no longer her lover but an emotional support. I told her about this and she said it wasnt the case at all, and that Jane basically was just a friend with a physical part in their relationship. She said that she had absolutely no reasons to leave me, which seems to translate to me now as \"why would I, since you will accept everything out of love and never demand anything\")\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThere are a lot of things I would never had accepted in a \"regular \" relationship but went along with bc of her particularities. She isnt an autodiag asperger (no offense meant here ) and I've come to witness the fact that her dyslexia and asperger syndrome really does impede her daily activities greatly and is a source of great stress for her.  She tries very hard to overcome her fears and is very brave about this but I know how hard it is for her.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI however feel like she could, on that ONE time, accept to not plan to spend the evening with Jane for my sake since i've been very present for her when she faced this kind of struggles. I love her with all my heart but I've been feeling completely stupid and naive this last days. She is supposed to come on the 31st at my home but said (probably out of anger) that since I mentionned It was only me coming to see her lately she will not come.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI am entierely lost. I feel like i'm going to be the guy being there when she feels bad and Jane the girl being there when she is fine. I've never loved anyone like I love her and envisionned to spend my life with her. She helped me growing as a person tremendously and she says she loves me. I know she cannot lie AT ALL about anything and is fully honest with me about her feelings, but i think this might be a case where she is telling me a lie she believes herself.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I being a controlling and over-demanding idiot there ?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThanks to anyone who bothered to read this, and please excuse my rather poor english\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTL DR; My gf, which relies on me for a lot of things including mainly emotional support and help on her homeworks, wasnt there for me at a time I needed her badly. Since she has asperger syndrome and was a victim of abuse, I tend to be very patient with her, but I think now that I'm just an idiot who made her my priority whereas i'm clearly not hers anymore.", "subreddit": "survivorsofabuse"}

But after my conflict with her 6 months ago, I also suspect that she may also be a covert Narc. I want to know if I am overthinking.\n\n1. She was really really friendly when we first met and she immediately tried to integrate me in her friends circle. \n2. Few days later, she quickly opened up about her traumatic past (abusive relationships and various incidents of sexual assault) which led to her clinical depression.  She also shared how her family, how all of her friends, relationships treated her horribly despite what she did for them every time. She shared that All her friends shunned her. \n\n3. I also understood why she was being self-destructive most of the time--getting excessively drunk, hurting herself, getting easily irritated or agitated who didn't agree with her and had conflicts with several people around her. Most of these people had a different story from what she said, but I always believed her.\n\n4. I didn't have any conflict with her until 6 months ago, where a mistake on my part, triggered a traumatic memory and she exposed all that I've shared with her, to everyone, along with major lies (me taking money from her, sharing bitterness, lying to people and etc). She genuinely believed these untrue parts, I think.\n\n5. She humiliated and vilified me to the point of mental breakdown (and I lost my friends as a result because she managed to convince them), accused me of things I never did or would do. Once she apologised (because she was outed on the lies by another friend) and asked for a second chance, she did  it again by sharing another lie about me. I blocked her since then.\n\nLike now, as I read more about covert narcissism, I realise more that she displayed several symptoms of of it--self-victimisation, counting-favours, persuading others to be vulnerable, always . I don't know if someone with depression would do these. Help me out here, I'd like to understand why she did what she did. Whether this was something she couldn't help or there was something really malignant. I am still going to therapy and trying to get better, but I would like to know more.\n\nTitle Edit.

I was the number three in the triangle.  I never slept with her but I did fall for her hard and she nurtured that and took all that emotional energy and ate it right up.\n\nWe worked together and she was awful always creating drama like narcs know how.

I was rehired four months later because I'm an awesome guy and the boss liked me because I gave him a rifle for his birthday.\n\nAnyway's today at work my boss referred to her as my girlfriend when we were casually talking about old coworkers.

WTF.", "author": "runningoutofrope", "self_text": "I thought it was me. I\u2019m still not sure I\u2019m not the N or something and trying to shirk responsibility. \n\nI have been completely disassociated. Went to therapy and I needed a feelings wheel every session because I had no idea what I was feeling. For years. \n\nSomething was really wrong. I had struggled with depression and anxiety my whole life but it was manageable. This was completely different. My marriage was struggling but my husband was a support, not the cause of anything. No matter what I did I could not put my finger on it. \n\nI attempted suicide. Other circumstances outside my marriage contributed to it so I made zero connection between being able to handle whatever life threw at me and then being so helpless and alone I wanted to die less than a year after being married. \n\nI\u2019m pretty sure this set me up as the crazy one for the rest of my marriage. It was undeniable proof that no matter what, I was the one with issues. \n\nI became a complete shell of a person. I just existed. I did things completely contrary to who I was. \n\nOne of my husband\u2019s friends pursued me after finding out that I tried to die and I cheated. No one knows, but I have carried the guilt all day every day. \n\nI couldn\u2019t figure out why I had done it. Even though I had made the decision and I know I was in the wrong, I had this feeling that I was victimized and I couldn\u2019t shake it. Which doesn\u2019t make a ton of sense, but maybe it does and I had blinders on. I don\u2019t know. \n\nI became focused on narcissism and had this idea that the man I cheated with was one and had sought me out for some reason and I wanted to fix that in myself. \n\nBut then I read about infidelity as well and thought I was trying to find an excuse to be a victim to excuse my behavior. Which was it? Both?\n\nIn retrospect, I don\u2019t think he was the guy I should have been worrying about.  \n\nAt parties, my husband\u2019s friends would approach me and ask why my husband and I weren\u2019t having sex. At gatherings with his family, his mother would make comments about my mental stability. At things like a BBQ for my birthday he would drink and sit with his head in his hands and divert all attention to him, crying how cold and mean I was to anyone who would listen. \n\nThen he would deny he had said a word about me to anyone and tell me he was absolutely not doing that at my party. I blew it off. \n\nI defended him for acting like that. I started omitting anything that made him look bad. \n\nI talked to him and wrote texts about how much this behavior hurt me. \n\nIt kept happening. \n\nHe constantly told me what everyone else said and thought about me and none of it was good. But that was smattered in between how much he loved me and such. \n\nHe convinced me that my depression medication was ruining our sex life and it sounded like it was coming from a place of concern and plausible so I stopped taking them. This was exactly what his mother brought up (minus the sex) when I was around her. Like to a t but I never put two and two together, that maybe a lot more talking was going on behind my back than I realized. \n\nDirectly after stopping my meds I became catatonically depressed. I always suspected he almost liked me better like that, always home, not talking or communicating to the outside world and tame. I actually knew that but either didn\u2019t have the insight or the energy to explore it and again blew the feeling off. \n\nWe limped along. To my face, he was my biggest supporter. \n\nWe messed around with drugs, drank a lot and never connected on a meaningful level. \n\nI struggled to keep us afloat. I actually said to a friend that he was so passive it was borderline abusive. No matter how I approached him about simple things that adults take care of he would either say he would do it and never take care of it or become unreasonably defensive that I didn\u2019t love him unconditionally and only did if he did what I wanted. Then sulk or leave. \n\nIf friends or even acquaintances asked for anything, no matter the inconvenience to our lives he would be there in heart beat but code enforcement would be at our door for everything he neglected at home. \n\nEverywhere we went together was miserable. He would sulk most of the night and regale anyone who would listen with stories about how much he loved me and how cruel and rejecting I was, just out of my earshot of course, but people would ask. It was humiliating. \n\nI begged and pleaded with him to stop airing our personal issues to everyone. He denied that he did and if he had slipped it was only because he felt so deeply for me and I kept hurting him. \n\nWe separated, tried marriage counseling and I put my foot down on the drinking and drugging. Got back together but the extreme passive aggressive shit continued.  Anything we had talked about stopping and he seemed to agree with just went on behind my back. \n\nSoon, we were absolutely bleeding money. I pinned him down to talk about it and he told me we had gotten into this together and would work it out together.  We agreed to both work two jobs for a bit and get back on our feet. \n\nI set up everything to begin an online source for a second income and was ready to go. I checked in with him. Nothing out there, nothing he could do about that. I looked at Indeed and found three different jobs he could easily do on the side. And cried all night. When I asked him about it the next day he blew up about my ridiculous expectations of him  \n\nI was in intensive therapy, still wondering what was wrong with me that kept me from connecting to my husband and being such a shitty wife. Guilty for the cheating, still trying to figure out why that\u2019s the type of person who sought me out or why I sought him or whatever went on, to stop anything like that from happening again. Made up my mind that it was a mistake made during a horrible time and not something I would repeat and since it was a friend, would not disclose it to my husband. I\u2019d just have to live with the guilt and I deserved it, especially since he loved me so much. It would kill him. \n\nThis entire last year I have become someone I don\u2019t even recognize. If I\u2019m not completely dissociated I have been raging pissed. I have isolated myself and become completely paranoid about what people think of me. I tried to create a normal persona on social media to counteract what my husband told me everyone thought about me. I stopped being invited to anything by his friend group and that made me even more paranoid. We didn\u2019t go to any family functions on his side at all anymore. I knew I was being actively avoided but couldn\u2019t figure out exactly why. I read and read about why I would feel like this and emotional abuse kept coming up. My childhood of course was not perfect but I couldn\u2019t imagine that some hidden abuse was just now manifesting itself, especially since I had been treated for depression for years and nothing like that had come up. \n\nIt kept nagging me though. \n\nHe accused me of cheating after I went out one night. I didn\u2019t, there wasn\u2019t much for him to actually assume from where I was and who I was with but he would not drop it. Constant fights about this particular night, which didn\u2019t really make sense to me because there were numerous times I had a better opportunity to cheat. I thought I was going to have to disclose what happened years ago if he asked directly, but he never did. Just fixated on this random night. I couldn\u2019t figure out what was up. Then the story became so ridiculous I knew he was lying about something and decided to check our cell phone records to follow up on one detail. \n\nHe did lie. But it was far beyond that little detail that peaked my interest. An affair with someone we had met as a couple six months ago. It was blatantly obvious from the phone bills. Also blatantly obvious was his other main constant contact was his coke dealer. \n\nThat\u2019s when the mask came off I think. \n\nHe denied and denied and denied. For a little bit, and then he became the most vicious, ugly, horrible person I have encountered in a long time. He attacked me on any level he could get at. I was floored. Absolutely floored. This was not who I married. My mind could not wrap itself around what was going on. I had no point of reference of who I was talking to. \n\nThen the character assassination that had gone on for months came out. It was so far beyond what I had complained about before. I could not believe what I was hearing. This was my husband. I had been struggling for so long and thought he was in my corner but I was wrong. So wrong. He had been my worst enemy. Again, I could not wrap my head around what I was hearing. \n\nHe went to stay with his family and it got even worse. I was told I was in a manic episode. I was told I was a meth addict and had been for at least a year. None of this was even a possibility but they were completely convinced. I was told he would never cheat and if I did it was my fault for being such a failure as a wife. \n\nThen I heard from all the other girls he had hit up. \n\nThen I had the police called on me. \n\nThen we tried to talk and I got a speech on how he had to cheat because I was such an awful and disappointing wife. If I felt bad I obviously was extremely selfish because he was going to have to live with this the rest of his life and imagine how that must feel? \n\nI begged him for an apology and said it was something we could possibly work out if he was sorry. After all, I had my infidelity as well and things had obviously been rough. \n\nThis guy that I had lived with and heard every version of I love you from fixed me with this cold, dead, stare I did not recognize and could not comprehend. Zero empathy. Nothing. He said I should feel lucky anyone would stay with me after attempting suicide. He told me I was the one who needed to apologize and left. \n\nJust this week he has since decided he doesn\u2019t want a divorce and loves me. My phone has been blowing up with texts about how we used to be and his love for me. He insists that everyone has thought I was crazy and on drugs, despite no one really interacting with me in person most of the year. \n\nNow, I have been reading about covert narcissism and passive aggressiveness and it\u2019s all there. All of it. He had me on a pedestal and when I wasn\u2019t the idealized person he expected his annihilated me behind my back. Not just having sex with someone else but systematically destroying me. \n\nThe flying monkeys. The victim mentality. Undermining by agreement then never following up. Telling me I was crazy over and over again. Inserting that \u201ceveryone agrees with him and they actually brought it up\u201d all the time.  The character assassination and devaluation. Isolation by telling me people thought terrible things about me. The constant and blatant lying that I don\u2019t think I have even scratched the surface of.  The sense of entitlement not just around deserving sex no matter from who or when but literally everything else. The months of me trying to figure out what was going on with me for seemingly no reason, and now the symptoms all add up. \n\nThe more I question, the more it seems this has all been happening for years and I just had no clue. \n\nThis has been the most vicious and confusing experience of my life. I thought I had a handle on what constitutes abuse or a personality disorder but I don\u2019t know now. \n\nI have absolutely no idea who the hell I have been living with for 6 years. I have never seen anything like it. \n\nI don\u2019t know what is up or down right now. I can\u2019t figure out if it\u2019s me or if it\u2019s him. Am I trying to pin this all on him as some coping mechanism or did this really just happen? Have I been this blind for this long?", "subreddit": "NarcissisticAbuse"}

My parents were never there for me from the ages of 1-5, I was practically raised by my aunt on my moms side, and my uncle on my dads side. During those years , my parents couldn\u2019t afford to raise me because their small brains didn\u2019t think that money would be an issue before having me. During that 5 year period, every time that my parents would send me over to my aunt and my uncles house, the other members of the family would laugh at me and point fingers because I was crying and crying in asian culture, no matter what the age is a sign of weakness. Asians have to repress all emotions even as a fuckin child. I have hated my parents since then.\n\nWhen I finally reached the age of 6 to 9 life was starting to look normal again. My parents were finally stable in their career and they were not switching jobs after jobs anymore. But then all of that changed when we had our home country in 2009. Our trip back to our home country lasted 3 weeks. In our culture (it\u2019s an unwritten rule), you aren't allowed to refuse a drink from someone who is \u201csuperior\u201d to you as it is considered disrespectful. So my dad, surrounded by his opportunistic brothers and sisters that only wanted all of our money since the beginning of time would offer him drinks after drinks to get him piss drunk. Eventually, when we returned from the trip after those 3 weeks, my dad ended up being a severe alcoholic. He turned verbally abusive and slowly one upped his manipulative side until he is the way that is is today. Extremely manipulative and controlling towards me and my mother to this day.\n\nFast forward to my third year of high school, my dad tried to kill my mom. It was an attempted murder that failed. The knife instead had slipped and cut my dad\u2019s right hand open. There were lots of screams and all I could do was hide in my room and hope that everything would be ok. It wasn\u2019t ok. My dad called form the hospital while I was crying in my room and ordered me to clean all of the blood on the floor. Not exaggerating, every single tile in the kitchen had at least a drop of blood on the floor. To this day, blood still remains on the wall in the living room. I have decided not to clean those because it was getting too long and tedious. This was a huge turning point in my life because now, my dad was getting more and more abusive day by day and my mom became the stereotypical submissive asian wife that will follow every order that my dad tells her to do. \n\nI finally had a bit of room to breathe when I dated M in college. He was my first boyfriend and was extremely supportive of me going through hard times with my bat shit backward conservative parents that refuse to divorce because divorces are considered shameful in asian culture and you gotta \u201csave face\u201d. My parents were constantly shaming me during this period because I had premarital sex (but let\u2019s not pretend my parents arent living in a dead bedroom relationship). My mom would constantly interrogate me on how much sex was I having with M a week. She would go through all my backpacks, find condoms and throw a tantrum. She would read my messages where I would text with M. The reason that I know this is that she would constantly hide behind my bed during the night and open my ipad to read my messages with him. My mom was and is a shit human being. I eventually broke up with M because we had some huge deal breakers that we couldn\u2019t resolve. Upon hearing the news, my mom was ecstatic. She was so happy that I finally broke up with my boyfriend because she wouldn't have to stalk him anymore. I was \u201cbecoming pure\u201d again.  Yayyy. This is about the same time that I started ignoring my dad. I barely talk to him. He\u2019s simply an existence that abuses my mom in this house now. I\u2019ve stopped giving a fuck about my dad. Honestly, that has improved my mental health for a bit. Unfortunately I can't cut them out of my life completely as I still depend on my parents financially.\n\nFast forward to now, I am finally in university. Things are finally going well but I had the chance of meeting this wonderful guy named J, who treats me well. We do have sex and of course my mom is scandalized again. She still checks my texts, my bags, my room every night. To avoid us having sex, she has set my curfew at 10pm and I\u2019m 21. Thankfully, he doesn't have facebook so it saves us all a headache because my mom only knows facebook. \n\nSorry mom, I don't plan on marrying the first guy that will go on a date with me like you did AND I don't plan on making the same mistakes you did by marrying that deadbeat man that you consider a husband that won't even touch you anymore and will manipulate you by feeding you lies. I hate that the only reason why you had me was for me to \u201ctake care of you later on\u201d. You\u2019re so fuckin entitled, it\u2019s sick.  I hate the life that you're living. I hate both of you. I will never have children because of you. I will forever hold a grudge against you. And believe me I will finish my degree and then sever all ties with the toxic parents that you two are. You deserve all the bad things that will come to you. You both are perfect for each other and frankly I wouldn't even shed a single tear if you both died tomorrow.\n\nIf any of yall are still here, thanks for listening.

It may be long and ranty but I\u2019m really confused.\nI (18/F) moved out from living with my parents less than a month after turning 18 because I was tired of the screaming fights multiple times a week, being grounded a month at a time constantly, being guilted, shamed, made fun of and put down. Recently I opened up to my aunt who I live with now (I moved across the country from them) and told her a lot of what went down and she cried for me and told me it was abuse, but I can\u2019t get myself to truly believe that? I feel like it was my fault and I deserved this \nMe and my father we\u2019re never close, I always preferred my mom over him which would make him jealous and he\u2019d constantly make fun of my mom to me who was a YOUNG child at the time. My father also married a woman who would make fun of me as a young child telling me I would never be loved because my head was too big? And telling me I talked too much just weird stuff. When they divorced my dad decided to take me away from my bio mom telling me she didn\u2019t want to see me, giving me no way to contact her, driving me 3 hours away to live with my grandparents and left me there while he went to live in Chicago and honestly now that I\u2019m older I really can\u2019t see why he\u2019d do that? He told me his parents treated him horribly, but was fully willing to leave me there. We really didn\u2019t have too much contact hed visit/call occasionally but I saw him once a month max, but then suddenly when I was 13 he wanted to move me out of state from my grandparents with his new gf and it was all downhill from there. \nAs soon as I had to live with him again my brain went back to this always on edge feeling I had felt living with him as a child.

My dad and stepmom decided the solution was to hide all soap from me and make me ask permission to use it and I could only use it if they deemed it necessary which to be honest they are unhygienic even by normal standards so it wasn\u2019t pleasant. They did this along with forcing me to do \u201cdirty\u201d stuff and not allowing me to wash my hand sending me into panic attacks crying on the floor and then they\u2019d get mad at me for it. Shockingly, this caused my issue to get way worse. Even my germaphobia aside we\u2019d fight all the time about anything and everything. I\u2019d never been grounded in my life but my dads new gf decided she knew better on how to raise a child (she had none) and that I needed grounded to correct my behavior. It was not used in moderation and in my opinion they abused this power. I was grounded for two weeks at one point for putting my shoes on wrong. We\u2019d fight So much when I was home I started spending as much time out at friends as possible. Being around my dad and his girlfriend was like walking on eggshells. And I felt so lonely, i craves affection so badly and it did make me act out sometimes. I had a really short temper because I was only ever told of how bad I was, how I\u2019m a bad person, I don\u2019t do well enough in school, I\u2019m a liar etc. I never got praise I rarely was hugged and it really took a toll on me. I had my first suicide attempt around this time when I was 14. My dad said I lied about how much of what I used to overdose on I took. My life consisted mostly of crying at this point. I started looking to boys to get validation it was pathetic. A few years later my dad let me move back to my grandparents because I caught his gf cheating (which I apperently lied about or didn\u2019t know what was happening because they \u201conly kissed\u201d) and I got so much better? My germaphobic problem went from being life controlling to almost not there. I was a lot happier, did still deal with depression but not so much that I couldn\u2019t get out of bed. \nI had to visit them once during this time and got into a huge fight because my dad purposely upset me, laughed at me while I cried and I did admittedly end up throwing a blender at him but he\u2019d been being shitty to me the entire visit. I know I shouldn\u2019t have done that and I felt bad but I didn\u2019t even know how to control myself anymore sometimes.\nThis changed again when my dad decided to move back too. I don\u2019t know why, but I panicked and immediately got super depressed. My grades went to straight F\u2019s I started experimenting with drugs and I stopped talking to half my friends. I ended up attempting suicide once again but this time it was much worse and I ended up 1 week in the hospital and one week in inpatient. When I got out I was guilt tripped for costing so much money, told my grades were so bad because I was lazy basically and I was now on antidepressants and in therapy (loved therapy but had a hard time being honest with her). From this point on (I was 16) until I moved out was hell. My dad and his gf had a baby. I also had an extremely toxic relationship at this point because I honestly did not know it was bad because i just wanted that little bit of affection. I was grounded minimum once a month. When I was grounded I was isolated for the most part. No phone, no internet, no friends. I went to school and came home that was it. I was mainly grounded for grades or for having \u201cmelt downs\u201d which I was always pushed into I feel like. The psych meds I was on as well as my depression caused me to sleep too much and I had a really hard time making it to the bus in the morning and would frequently miss it which I was grounded for as well. Around this point when I\u2019d bring up things they did wrong I was often told I remembered wrong or I was lying. My dad made fun of me a lot. I\u2019m still convinced I\u2019m stupid because of it honestly. Around this time I started self harming again which I haven\u2019t done since I\u2019d moved back to my grandparents originally. \nI had a lot of problems being overly sexual around this time too and I don\u2019t know why I just felt like I wanted to be liked so badly. I was a minor sending nudes frequently to anyone who asked (my relationship was never official for reasons I don\u2019t want to get into). I even would post them on social media. I don\u2019t know what was wrong with me. \nThen I did the worst thing imaginable. When I was 17 I accidentally got pregnant. I told my aunt first who promised she wouldn\u2019t tell my dad because she trusted me to do it herself and she didn\u2019t think it was her place to rat me out. She wanted me to feel safe with her because she knew I didn\u2019t really have anyone to feel safe and comfortable with. I eventually told him when I was 7 weeks. 2 weeks after I found out. I waited because I was scared and I still regret telling them. I didn\u2019t want an abortion because I personally didn\u2019t think I could mentally handle that so I was punished and given ultimatums. Yelled at, insulted, just in general treated like shit and cried 90% of everyday. I finally said I\u2019d get an abortion just so they\u2019d stop treating me that way. And was immediately rewarded. I was going to try to secretly not go with through with it because I really didn\u2019t want to but when we got to the planned parenthood I found out I had miscarried at nearly 10 weeks and was devastated. And they were still shitty to me. My dad even made a joke about it on the way home. I ended up having to have an abortion because the fetus didn\u2019t come out of me? It just didn\u2019t have a heartbeat. I opted for the pill kind because my dad told me it would just be a heavy period. The planned parenthood doctor told them someone would need to watch over me for a day or two. Nobody did. There was so much blood it got all over everything and I could barely take care of myself it was the middle of the night and I was just crying, it physically and mentally horrible. \nMy relationship with them got worse after this they\u2019d constantly guilt trip me for it. My dad would get mad at me for feeling sad I\u2019d lost my child I had an attachment to and told me I was never a mother to which I replied fuck you and was grounded for a month. I was also put on an antipsychotic that I didn\u2019t want to take. (I\u2019ve now been off it for months and feel better than ever and still believe I didn\u2019t need it) and since I wouldn\u2019t take it they\u2019d grind that and my birth control pills up, put them in water and make me drink it in front of them every night and if I didn\u2019t I was grounded. I tried to run away, but they said they\u2019d call the police on anyone I went to. And at this point I did start being horrible to them too, I was just so fed up with them. I didn\u2019t like them even slightly anymore. \nMy best friend then moved in with us and my dads gf immediately made everything worse. She told my best friend really personal stuff about me that I don\u2019t like people knowing, told her I was crazy, made up a bunch of weird shit about me, and told her any and all mental illness struggles I had were for attention. She slowly made my best friend hate me and continues even when I asked her to stop. This ended up fucking up the whole family my grandparents included. \nFound my stepmoms diary as well full of her saying I was an abusive manipulator and that she thought it would be better when I left. Half her diary was mainly just how much she hated me honestly and maybe they were right like I might\u2019ve been the one causing all out problems toward the end I was so upset all the time. Around this time I ended up developing and eating disorder which I struggled with until I moved out at 18. I was grounded for 3 weeks after I turned 18 for missing an assignment in class, buying tabaco products, and for not obeying rules about going out. So I just left.\nI cut contact with them shortly after because my dad defended what my stepmom wrote. The last irl conversation I had with my dad he told me I was a worthless loser like my mom. They tell people I\u2019m a diagnosed compulsive liar, sociopath, and have bpd. I requested all my documents from the mental health clinic I went to and was diagnosed with none of these. They started telling people this when I started telling people what happened. \nI just feel like it is all my fault. I feel like I missed a lot but I guess this is the gist of it. Am I at fault here? I sometimes feel like when I tell people I\u2019m just being manipulative and I cry so much because I\u2019m a manipulator. I\u2019m so confused. Remembering stuff that happened has started affecting my daily life and I\u2019ve been having nightmares.", "subreddit": "abuse"}

It is the first time in a really long time that I have woken up with joy and happiness on my birthday.  \n\nMy birthday has always been hard.  Being born close to christmas it is easy to feel overshadowed by the holiday. When I was little I seldom had Birthday parties because winter break at school had already begun, and most of my friends were busy with family events.  When I got older and was in college somehow my Birthday always ended up being during finals week, and understandably no one was up for celebrating.  \n\nOnce I moved into adulthood and meat my Nex. He was wonderful for my Birthday, at first.  In the beginning he made me feel special for my day.

There was always this underlying feeling of wrongness to it.  For example, he would take me and our kids out to dinner and make it clear he would rather be anywhere else in the world than at that dinner.  Head buried in his phone, texting with his friends, big sighs and dirty looks.  Constantly asking if everyone was done yet, asking for the check when the food arrives so we can leave faster.  When I couldn't properly hide my feelings of wrongness with the situation, and wasn't happy enough, I would get berated for being ungrateful, for being self centered and selfish.  I would buy right into it.  He did get me things, and do things for me, so why did I feel awful?  Everything he said about me must me true. \n\nAnyway.  That is how it used to be, but not this year.

I started to say that I wanted a lil attention and he immediately got angry with me, blamed me for ruining things because I expect too much and I can't just let things be nice, and ended up calling me a bitch. I stormed out of the room and played Assassin's Creed on my PS4 for an hour or so. I came back into bed and went to sleep, feeling very sad. He woke me up a few hours later to tell me \"Babe, I'm going out for a bit with my mate, I'll be back soon\" and I asked him if he was going to apologise for calling me a bitch? He then lost it at me again, said I never let him spend time with his friends (not true, and not at all what I was complaining about), that I'm controlling, delusional, he even called me a psychopath, all whilst I laid in my bed and cried.

About 8 months ago he broke up with me, slept with someone else, and then got back together with me all in the space of a few days. I didn't trust him.

He called me a cunt, an asshole, a bitch, delusional, mentally ill, and embarrassing. He said \"have fun being used for sex\".  He told me he hated me, repeatedly. He said I'd subjected him to the worst of the worst emotional abuse all the while pretender he was the abuser. There was a lot more but I've sort of blocked it out of my mind, and the messages are gone now. When I told him he was really fucking upsetting me and I wasn't coping with it, he said \"your mental disorder isn't my problem\". He continued to hurl insults at me whilst I sat alone in my flat crying hysterically. I banged my head against the wall repeatedly. I cut myself for the first time in months. I loved him more than anything in the world, I tried to give him everything, and this was what he truly thought of me. He then said he never wanted to speak to me again and blocked me on every platform. \n\nNow, about 2 months later, he's sending me massive paragraphs about how amazing I am, how much he misses me, about all the little things he loves about me.

It hurt but I knew when I challenged him he would explode so I let it slide.\n\nDuring his idealization phase he lovebombed me a lot and called me beautiful and pretty every day. I can pinpoint when the devaluation phase set in because the compliments stopped and everytime he saw me he looked irritated and displeased. \n\nIt was always something, could be absolutely tiny. He didn\u2019t like the pattern on my dress, he didn\u2019t like my makeup, my eyebrows looked a bit uneven etc. He could always find fault in anything, he could turn a paradise into a cesspit with his negativity. \n\nHe would tell me what to wear and how to do my makeup to his liking. He made me feel like a project.\n\nAt the end he pulled the rug out from under me. Boasted that he had cheated on me, could do better than me, was only going through the motions, didn\u2019t want to see or talk to me a lot of the time we were dating (he was the one who would call me for 6 hours when I asked him to call me for 5 minutes, lol) \n\nThe thing that hurt most was when he said I was just a practice partner and that he\u2019d always intended to marry someone from his home country and keep the bloodline \u2018pure\u2019 and that the thought of us getting married or having kids was unrealistic, even though he talked about it so many times. \n\nHis negative comments still go through my head and I am struggling to recover my self esteem. Even though I know nothing is ever good enough for him and he is projecting his self hate onto others, I still doubt myself and question myself. Sometimes I wonder if blaming him is just cope and that maybe if I had become better and changed myself to suit his needs he would still be with me. \n\nBut even if he was dating the perfect woman he would still get bored and find an excuse to cheat on or devalue her. Nothing is ever good enough. All his exes were stunning and treated him like gold, yet he had nothing but narc bitterness and contempt for them. Dating him is casting pearls before swine. \n\nHe identified all my fears and weak spots and exploited them.\n\nI just want to be able to love myself again.", "subreddit": "NarcissisticAbuse"}

So, I feel like our damaged psyches have pretty much conspired to fuck everything up (I've become super emphatic (a high level of empathy helps you avoid triggering a violent outburst) which makes me come off as a \"nice\" guy and she is obviously wired to distrust folks who come off as \"nice\").\n\nSince I didn't really understand how living with a narcissist may have changed her worldview, I just assumed she wasn't interested (and she very well may not have been but was afraid of a violent reaction). So, I told her I didn't think she was interested and wished her the best (and haven't talked to her since).\n\nWould my behavior have triggered a \"narcissist warning\" and if so, am I fucked?

The first time I was at work and when I got home my front door was wide open and my disabled cat was missing. When I confronted him about it he at first was very apologetic and \u201cshocked\u201d that the door wasn\u2019t closed but then started getting aggressive about how since he has paid his share of rent this month he still has full rights to the house regardless of the fact that he has moved out and we are broken up. By the end of the long crazy-making conversation had accused me of trying to sleep with his friends while we were together and threatened to harm himself. And kept insisting he would come over to help me look for the cat when it was 2am at that point (I work late). The next morning he said he made posters for the cat and sent me one and it had HIS phone number on it! I asked him why on earth it had his number on it and he said because he can let me know if someone finds him. He then showed up at my house maybe 5 minutes after I left for work and somehow immediately found the cat. \n\nThen he came by and while he was getting his things texted me that he changed my air filter, changed out the litter box, and did some other weird things around the house which felt very violating. I haven\u2019t even been responding. But then today he came by (again, unannounced) when he knows this is my one day off a week and I was in bed asleep with the door open to let the cat in and out and was going past my door and doing things around the house and once again gathering just a couple things to take. At this rate he will be coming by for weeks and weeks. \n\nWhat do I do? Tell him I need to be notified in advance when he will be coming by? Give him a deadline of when to be out? Gather everything else he has and put them in the garage so he isn\u2019t traveling through the house so much? Change the locks??

At first it was words. Telling her to get out and that she couldn\u2019t treat him like this. Then just screaming. No words. I grabbed my wallet and ran. I was gonna run away, but I ended up just sitting in my car barefoot, having a panic attack because I couldn\u2019t leave my dog and cat here with him alone. He then came into the car acting like he was the victim. And he said if it weren\u2019t for me and my brothers he would kill himself. That seriously traumatized me.

I don't know what else to do.\n\nMy sister and her ex-husband have been divorced for about 3 years, and separated for a full year before that.  What is known is that he had a history of verbal abuse to her and both her kids, was financially sketch, and then became violent when my nephew (her son) was about 5 y/o (he is 10 now).  That was when my sister drew the line and started her process of separation and eventually divorce.  They had shared legal custody but she has full physical custody, allowing him time on weekends, if their schedule permits.  He often favored my niece who is now 17, and kind of tolerates my nephew, often making fun of him or making him feel left out.\n\nDuring Thanksgiving break she and my nephew had separate celebration with his side of the family, and because many family members were in town, their sleeping arrangements were different than usual and he and my niece and nephew were put up in one room.  Strangely, he had my nephew sleep in a hammock while he had my niece sleep in the bed with him.  In the course of two nights, while my nephew slept (he is a heavy sleeper) he ran his hands up and down her thighs, cupped her buttocks, tickled her waist and tried to reach under her shirt to fondle her breasts.  She was confused about what was happening and only tried to squirm around so he wouldn't touch her.  Not sure how it ENDED but only know that one night he did masturbate while he held her upper thigh.\n\nI am disgusted, and heartbroken that a person could do this to their own child, who trusts them so completely, who is supposed to be able to look at this person as a protector and a provider but who is actually a monster.\n\nMy sister is in shock and disgust, and possibly a little bit of shame (that she was married to this man for so many years).  She is concerned this may have happened before to an extent but it never went this far to make my niece speak up.  My niece had a mental breakdown in the spring where she had to have an evaluation and was later put on anxiety meds and weekly therapy.  She had just been cleared to stop therapy and this happened.  BUT because of that episode, she had a safety plan in place that she followed.  The Monday following the incident, she was at school and she was upset and she spoke out about what happened to a counselor.  Long story not short, the douche bag has been arrested.  After stressful days of reporting this to the school, the police, CPS, they caught him on a phone call admitting to it all.\n\nI openly sobbed when my sister told me everything, because I too, have a history with him.  I knew him when I was young and he was dating my sister, he even used to buy me Barbies, and when I lived with them for 2 years right out of high school, he said inappropriate things to me, implying he wanted to have sexual relations with me.  I was openly upset and responded with HELL NO.  Afraid I would run to my sister, he was defensive and said that I was overreacting and he was just talking and that he never touched me.  My sister was pregnant at the time (with my niece) and because I was also confused and didn't want to cause problems while my sister was in such a delicate state, I said nothing and just moved out.  I had thought of him like a brother and it broke my heart at that time to know he was a snake.  I kept up a friendly front with the family but never let myself be alone with him again.  Later during her divorce my sister was made aware of it.  Now I feel like I made a mistake, but don't know if I had spoken up earlier if it would have made a difference.\n\nMy sister tries to be strong but I can tell she is struggling with coping with this.  At one point she said that per the court the kids will not allowed to see him and that my niece doesn't want to anyway but for her son, she thought it cruel because he already struggles with feeling rejected by his father, and maybe they can facetime eventually.  I WAS SHOCKED that she would even think this way - why would she want this monster to see either child anymore?   while I am trying to remain supportive, I questioned why she would want to expose her son to a father who she no longer is sure of what he is capable of?  Our eldest sister stepped in with better words, and suggested that she speak to people in CPS and also in therapy on how this situation is typically handled.\n\nAnyone know how they handle issues like this when there is a sibling involved, and how does the parent cope?  Or what is appropriate behavior on my part, as a concerned loved one?  Do I just stay quiet and give hugs?  I have a lot of emotions about this, but I don't want to add to my sister's stress, I want to help support and comfort.  Any advice or insight into this is greatly appreciated.\n\nIf you read this far, thanks.", "subreddit": "abuse"}

He\u2019s gone without a care in the world. Blocked me and ignored me. It\u2019s been almost a week, maybe two. This weekend I think he was with someone new, but I don\u2019t know. I can\u2019t stop ruminating on it.\n\nI\u2019ll be fine for a while when I\u2019m distracted, but then I\u2019ll suddenly remember him and think about where he is, what he\u2019s doing and whether he\u2019s with her. It hits me hard and the wave of anxiety is overwhelming each time. It goes away after a few minutes. Once I distract myself again basically.\n\nI truly just hate him. I didn\u2019t know they were capable of this. I don\u2019t even have the words to express how manipulative and terrible he is. He gave me nothing but breadcrumbs for two years and I stayed. The lies never stopped. He actually believed his own lies I think. He had no remorse or empathy. If I cried he became annoyed more than anything. After all I did for him, he left. We were apart for some time, and I was doing great. Then he came back. Decided to give it another shot, and I started trusting him again. For almost 8 months we talked every day and he was planning on moving to live with me. But then slowly but surely communication got worse and worse. It already sucked, I never felt like a priority, and I never felt like he reciprocated the same amount of attention I was giving him. I finally gave up on him as I was so unfulfilled. I told him I was done. He said I would never find anyone better and hung up. We didn\u2019t talk for four days and finally I broke and called him. He told me he has a new job and is working hard, and he seemed like a new person. Like he had started a new life. I couldn\u2019t help but wonder why he so easily gave in to the breakup. But that\u2019s just his way of manipulating me. He couldn\u2019t respond with apologies or asking me to stay, because that would admit guilt. Instead he made me feel like it was my fault for being clingy and needy, and he wanted something healthy. All because I told him I wanted him to be more attentive about our phone calls and picking up the phone. He was totally unreliable and inconsistent. He was inconsiderate of my schedule and only called when it was convenient for him. Now I\u2019m stuck here while he\u2019s with someone else already. I didn\u2019t think he\u2019d ghost me a second time. I called him on Friday to ask him what he wanted to do. He said prior to that, that he\u2019d be there if I changed my mind. So I asked him to tell me whether he wanted to make it work or not. He had to go into work and I told him to call me by the afternoon that day. He never called. The next day I tried calling him and it rang but no answer. His phone is supposedly \u201cbroken\u201d and has been for weeks now. I called again and he sent it to voicemail. I tried one more time and realized I was blocked. I sent him an email begging him to just call me and he never responded. It\u2019s been two days since then and I still haven\u2019t heard. I told him via Facebook that I was done if I didn\u2019t hear from him that night and he never responded to that either. I could see that his location was in Maryland all weekend, even though he\u2019s from Jersey. I have no idea why he\u2019d be there but I think I can guess. Who knows. He\u2019s a lying piece of shit and I\u2019m going to fail my finals because of him unfortunately. He destroyed my mind little by little and I\u2019m stuck. I\u2019m paralyzed by the pain. The idea that he can toss me aside yet again, after ripping my life to shreds the first time. And I still gave him a chance.\n\nI hate him so much. For everything. I don\u2019t know if he\u2019ll ever reach out but if he does I\u2019d like to scream at him. And make him feel the way I felt. I just can\u2019t take it anymore. How can he (35M) choose someone else over me (25M). I have everything going for me. Looking back now I can see all of the signs that he was a textbook narcissist. I won\u2019t even get into the reasons because they\u2019re so annoying. Obsessed with money, power, nice things, appearances, etc. Pathological lying, extreme manipulation, silent treatments, stonewalling. Never letting me get a word in. Never letting me be right. Never apologizing. Acting like everyone owes him something such as special treatment. Becoming furious with waiters, salespeople and even friends. Talking very crudely about innocent people walking by. Insulting anyone he saw as a threat. Being sneaky talking to his ex, but always asserting that he was too hurt by his mom\u2019s a affair to ever cheat. Meanwhile he\u2019s probably been talking to another girl this whole time. It\u2019s killing me because I don\u2019t know for sure. I don\u2019t know if she exists. And I want to so badly. I want to catch him so I can finally know that I did the right thing by leaving. I want proof that my suspicions are correct so that he can stop denying them every chance he gets.\n\nAnyways, today is day 3. I\u2019m barely holding on. I have finals and because of this asshole I\u2019ve barely been able to focus. I\u2019ve spent my time begging for him back and pleading with him just to call me. It\u2019s so embarrassing. I hate him. He ruined me. I really hope he suffers and I don\u2019t feel bad saying that. He\u2019s deserves it more than anyone I ever met. He\u2019s truly evil.", "subreddit": "NarcissisticAbuse"}

I'm mad at believing in prayer and religion and people who I couldn't trust. \n\nI was on the right path to having enough money to leave my narc. I was finally getting all my bills paid each month and getting money put away. A friend told me to just pray about it. I have always been against prayer because I have never had a prayer answered. When it comes to religion I've had a totally different experience from other religious people. \n\nI listened to my friend who assured me that if I ask god for help then I will receive help. I did just that. Less than 12 hours later and I received a fraud alert from my bank asking if I authorized a check for an amount greater than what was in my bank account. I said no and thought that was over. \n\nNope. The check was still processed and now all my money is gone. The bank opened a second checking account for me and I had no money to put in there since the fake check took it all. I thought this wouldn't be a problem since direct deposit was in 2 days and I'd have money. Another big nope. Instantly all the automatic payments from my old account started being charged to my new account. I didn't have any money in there and I got charged a bunch of overdraft fees. The bank refused to remove the fees. Less than 24 hours later and I closed the account and let them know  I will not pay the fees. Last night I went to transfer money into my checking account with my new bank and I accidentally put it in to my old account which caused me to reopen the closed account and I paid the fees. Can't take that one back. And I still can't close my fraud account so all the money I have in there is unable to be touched. \n\nRight when I thought I had this all figured out and then someone comes along and takes it all away. \n\nAlso, I hate this bank. It is a huge bank that can afford to not charge me a bunch of fees but they won't.

I was  and my cousin was 7 (his mother passed at this time). Now my cousin has always been a very strong boy that I\u2019ve seen him hit a grown man off his feet. Anyways, I was really startled as he started to put his hands on me and feel my body (this is when I developed fast I had quite big boobs for a primary school child)\n\nNow please believe me when I was really upset even though I was older I was nowhere near strong as him I tried to run out of the room but he got in front of the door he started to punch and kick me and threw me on the bed I started to cry he then climbed on top of me which I tried to push him off which I couldn\u2019t because as I said he was strong this has happened for a few years I couldn\u2019t tell anyone due to being terrified that I\u2019d get the blame seemingly as I was older than him. \n\nThe second incident a family friend invited me to stay over at his and I didn\u2019t want to but my grandmother said I should also I shouldn\u2019t let my friend down. I slept over the night. Now I was around 10 by this age and this man turned on porn with his two sons aged 2&amp; 7 and he was in his 40s. I fell asleep scared to death wanting to go home. I then woke up to his hands down the back of my pants trying to pull them down but I remained faking sleep silently crying. This man had an interest with me over the years watching me get dressed when my mum was putting the dress on me, trying to peel on me upstairs when I gotten out of the bath, winking at me and putting his hands inappropriately on my legs. I told my grandmother about this and she believed me after these years and I was so relieved. \n\nThe third event now read carefully I\u2019ve never ever been attracted to kids I don\u2019t find them sexy or attractive because that\u2019s just wrong they\u2019re just kids getting along in their lives. But what I did will change my life now I\u2019ve never myself molested a child but I will tell you this I thought at a young age 11 I had gotten revenge for the years that\u2019s happened to me to this family friends son by scarring him for life but of course didn\u2019t work it\u2019s haunted me for life and I wish for god I could take it back. Another time we had family friend twins please god forgive me for what I\u2019m about to say here as I said I didn\u2019t understand the whole sexuality thing I didn\u2019t know what my part downstairs was as nobody explained to me or taught me what it meant or what boobs were and why I had them I just knew I was a girl. \nI took out one of my boobs and let the twin touch it but I never touched them back I swear on my life. I just know somewhere I\u2019ve caused damage to others somewhere down the timeline and to repair it will take massive guts and I\u2019m sorry if it\u2019s hard to swallow or not enough detailed it\u2019s just too hard to go through. It always creeps into my mind that I\u2019ve done these things and I\u2019m in massive amounts of shame that I committed these things knowing how it affected me.\n\nI know it wasn\u2019t an excuse and that I was a kid but I honestly didn\u2019t understand what I did and why I just know it\u2019s what I was taught through my abuse and passed it on in some disgusting manner. I\u2019ve vowed to myself I\u2019ll never go through that again and that I\u2019ll never let anyone harm my youngest cousin or any children I have to harm by what I\u2019ve experienced. I\u2019ve never known that dark side I\u2019m still suffering with that I did and I know what\u2019s in the dark will come to light and when that day happens I\u2019ll be prepared I\u2019d rather tell the truth instead of be a coward and hide in the shadows. It\u2019s onto telling my family now... \n\nI\u2019m extremely sorry if this has upset anyone who\u2019s a survivor and is dealing with this I hope you make a full recovery goodluck godbless and peace \n\nIf you\u2019ve been through this tell an adult straight away don\u2019t end up like me and suffer for years it really damages you in ways you can\u2019t imagine", "subreddit": "abuse"}

Tbh it feels awkward to use it for a human but i respect people's pronouns no matter how badly they behave. I'll use the letter E for it.\n\nFiancee, referred to as L: partner with E, partner with H, my fiancee\nMe: partner with E, fiancee of L\nH: partner of L and partner of me\nE: partner of L alone. metamour of me and H\n\nSo, about a month and a half ago, L met E. and within 3 weeks, despite L claiming i would always be her primary partner (we've been together for 5 years and extremely close for 5 prior to that), E had inserted itself into my spot. E was very friendly to me at first, but slowly it decided it didn't like me, apparently it hates almost everyone, and started becoming increasingly abusive. Eventually E made a really horrible comment to me that was exactly like my nmom, showed no remorse so i blocked it. It decided to pester L daily to make me unblock it after that. Additionally when it met H, i have no idea what happened because i haven't heard the specifics but H flipped shit because of something E did. Now, H is 99% of the time extremely sweet, passive and kind towards everyone. Both H and i  are extremely suspicious of E, it's behavior is full of red flags and it's extremely rude. Everyone else who meets E is to some degree unnerved by its behavior......\n\nNow, i must admit i have autism and C-PTSD beforehand, this causes me to have violent meltdowns that are dangerous for me and at minumum extremely distressing to L because she can't handle yelling or loud noises due to her own PTSD. Another part of my PTSD, is due to a specific trauma, if someone who is EXTREMELY important to me hangs up on me intentionally, or blocks me on some communication format, i will have a SEVERE panic attack, to the point that this happened today (L has her own problems with being cruel), and it just so happened BPDmom's therapist called me looking for her, right in the middle of the worst part of it, and it resulted in her repeatedly offering to call emergency services or mobile crisis, and she sounded VERY concerned. So it's pretty bad panic attacks. \n\nOne day i unblocked E, bad choice but whatever. it immediately started a fight, and i really can't recall what happened to cause this, but L had a panic attack/flashback, and at one point had her door tied shut. E knew she was having one, i guess L told it she felt it starting or she told it after i had calmed her down. E was spewing some BS about my fiancee not being my fiancee, and said i was taking advantage of her panic attack to lie to it about us being in a relationship which.... why? Also i told it she can talk now, because i had spent a good 30 min trying to help her, and it accused me of lying. It then demanded proof that i was able to get to her (she had tied the door shut, but also had untied it a while before i came to help her) And sometime while i was walking up the stairs it blocked me, with the message \"I wonder what would happen\"..... It knew i have panic attacks when L blocks me on shit, it assumed it was important enough by default to cause a panic attack or a rage freakout or something???? Lucky for L's fragile mental state, i laughed it off because i hate E by this point.\n\nWhat worries me is, L can get suicidal and harm herself during panic attacks, i assume E knows this, i end up harming myself during meltdowns, sometimes i lash out at people who try to touch me, hit objects, throw things, etc, i scream a lot. Like there's a huge reason i'm actively working on preventing these meltdowns from ever happening at all. Please note that i've almost eliminated them entirely, none have happened since at least October or even before. See the thing is, it KNEW L was in a fragile mental state. i imagine it foresaw a chance to intentionally set me off, make me look horrible and dangerous and then coerce L into leaving me. But it risked L's mental and physical wellbeing to hurt me. If it didn't consider the risk to L's health and safety that's honestly WORSE.\n\nAdditionally, lemme know if this is more of L's problem, or if you think E might be manipulating her into behaving this way. L just looks the other way when E abuses me and H, and does nothing to prevent any of it, and often makes excuses for its behavior. I finally confronted her on it today and she said, verbatim, copy pasted (she's out of state right now): \"I'm not unconcerned with it, but it's literally a matter of someone who improves my mental health consistently, and people who... don't.\" So her excuse is that me and H aren't useful enough to her to defend? Or is it that E is somehow coercing her into letting it do whatever it wants to us?\n\nI'm worried for my fiancee's safety around E. E is absolutely lovebombing the shit out of her, and although literally everyone else can see E's NPD traits, she insists she sees nothing wrong with it. Also replacing a partner of 10 years in 3 weeks is extremely red flag right?\n\nEdit: I've been reading articles about grooming and E has been grooming the everloving fuck out of her, since the moment they met. I have to save her, she's done so much for me over the years before she lost her shit. I can't let this happen to her. If i overtly try to split them up i'm afraid she'll turn on me. but i've been telling her for weeks that E is not sincere, i just haven't had the resources to back myself up. And she is taking my concerns seriously, she certainly trusts me to a degree, cos she'll occasionally ask me if a certain thing E did is problematic or not. If me, our mutual very close friend, and H all get together and confront her on this perhaps we can stop this before it goes too far?\n\n\nUPDATE: I confronted her. She listened for a while, I use that word fucking lightly... And then she got tired of me caring for her well-being and told me that she sees this thing happen with everyone who gets to know me a little. Apparently they see how incredibly violent abusive and aggressive I am towards people all the time and they are so petrified of me that if they disagree with me they always lie because they are afraid I'll start abusing them.\n\nYes. I am so incredibly terrifying that literally nobody is willing to disagree with me for fear of retaliation. You see she knows me very well and she knows that's the kind of thing to stick in my head forever.\n\nWhat the worst part is, she included a few names of my closest people who provide the most support (who frequently tell me I'm wrong btw) but hyperfocused on one of my longest lasting friendships which has given me the most support.\n\nShe spent extra time informing me how terrified he clearly has been for years of me and was afraid for his life or some shit.\n\nFor some information on this guy, he's a first degree backbelt, and I've never taken any kind of martial arts lesson in my entire life. If he wanted to he'd have 0 issue fucking ending me.\n\nThen I dissolved a server I spent a ton of time on setting up because the way she just tried to ruin my ability to believe any kind of emotional support basically indefinitely, made me not want her to have it.... And you see it contained 6 people, and both she and I had all sorts of ways to contact everyone in there, and literally 2 out of 6 people were the same persons 2 accounts. L knows a narcissist parent and ex have really done a number on my mental health. And knows it hurts to be compared to my abusers. Despite showing a grand total of 0 symptoms of NPD that don't also show up in 75% of psychiatric issues across the board, she's started insisting that there's this big group of people who are certain I am extremely npd and she sends me this shitty email attacking me for destroying my server and accusing me of intentionally isolating her just like all narcissists do.... I am definitely doing a great job isolating her when I delete a server full of people she can contact all sorts of other places that was almost never used (almost never is too frequent to be accurate)\n\nShe also spent a lot of yesterday trying to convince me that I'd be much better off dead, and that she believes in euthanasia for intractably mentally ill and that she wants peace for me. I kept saying how I want to live.... And she kept saying it would be better to die", "subreddit": "NarcissisticAbuse"}

I finally lost my temper after he disrespected my boundaries. First I told him gently that he said he would text if he was going to be over an hour late for dinner (he was 3 hrs late and this topic had been a big roadblock before) and I was disappointed he hadn\u2019t done this. He started yelling at me and followed me upstairs when I tried to get some space. I got into bed and pretended to look at my phone and stay silent. I finally said something sassy so he yelled for a bit then walked out. I didn\u2019t hear from him for a week, so I just blocked him on everything. \n\nI was doing well with nc (been 10 days) and put phone on \u2018do not disturb\u2019 too (just in case he pulled the old \u2018no caller id\u2019 trick). But, and here\u2019s where I need to have a word with myself, I contacted him (he\u2019d still not picked up his stuff; at this point I\u2019m still being polite). He asked me to leave them outside for him to pick up \u201clater\u201d but they\u2019re just left on the pavement outside my house for 2 days (I don\u2019t have front garden, so it\u2019s a public walkway). I ask again when he\u2019s coming as they\u2019re a hazard, he just texts \u201cdon\u2019t know what the problem is\u201d. I lost my temper and put it all in the bin and stupidly texted him that. I knew I\u2019d regret it.\n\nFirst it\u2019s texts calling me crazy etc. asking if I\u2019m \u201cunwell\u201d (I understand the implication), then a call. It started ok, I admitted I\u2019d taken the bait and also wanted to know why he thought I was lying about something (in a previous text he\u2019d said I was \u201ctalking nonsense\u201d to put it politely, but wouldn\u2019t say anything else). Then the gaslighting started, saying I\u2019m going mad (I certainly feel that way) and that he had no idea what he\u2019d done wrong in the first place. The phone call got heated on my end- the rage and frustration seemed to come out of nowhere. I swore at him and generally behaved like the crazy person he was describing. He swore at me, then hung up. \n\nThen I sent a barrage of crazy texts, basically telling him I was really hurting (tho a lot less rational than that). Then I panicked and blocked him again, I thought I\u2019d done enough damage. \n\nMy brain is now like a pillowcase full of angry wasps, I\u2019ve gone through my mindfulness techniques and I\u2019ve booked to talk to my therapist first thing tomorrow. I just don\u2019t know what to do about feeling so stupid at inviting this- I contacted him! I\u2019m trying not to dwell, but I can\u2019t shake the shame feeling. \n\nNutshell: I chose to break no contact, now I\u2019m really angry with myself. Does anyone have similar experiences, or have any different techniques to calm down afterwards please?", "subreddit": "NarcissisticAbuse"}

This is a man who I had NEVER even so much as second-guessed before D-Day so, to go from that to literally not even knowing who I was looking at, was the most traumatic thing I\u2019ve ever gone thru.\n\nLittle by little, he\u2019s told me more and more of his decade-long double life BUT it ALWAYS had to be told on HIS terms and HIS timing(regardless of how much I was suffering and needed to put the pieces together to try and wrap my head around it all) BUT my gut has never failed me and I\u2019ve known that there\u2019s more to his stories, especially since his actions never matched his words.\n\nTwo weeks ago, he \u201cdecided\u201d to do a full disclose(after 9 months of putting me thru hell and slowly watching me wither away) BUT the thing is, aside from a few small details(like dates he met up with women) he didn\u2019t really disclose anything new that I hadn\u2019t already gotten from him(little by little these last 9 months).\n\nI guess I\u2019m just VERY confused as to why he felt the need to continually lie if it\u2019s ONLY been dates/times and had already disclosed the rest of it...I just don\u2019t get it.\n\n\nThat said, He\u2019s been going to marriage counseling with me, he\u2019s sworn that he\u2019s not done a single thing since D-Day, he\u2019s vowed to NEVER hurt me again, he\u2019s been communicating with me more than he EVER has and he seems SO God Damn sincere BUT...this Is  also a man who has lied to me over and over and over again, while looking me DEAD in my eyes.\n\nIve dealt with his verbal abuse, silent treatments, being used for sex, never being considered, him treating other women(or other people in general) WAY better than he\u2019s ever treated me and I\u2019ve dealt with with him having a HUGE sense of entitlement towards what HE wants, for YEARS....\n\nYet- I SO badly want to believe him when he begs for my forgiveness, apologizes over and over again  and tells me that he wants NOTHING more than to be the husband that I\u2019ve deserved but haven\u2019t had.\n\nHe\u2019s ALWAYS been the BEST \u201ctalker\u201d for sure.\n\nI have severe relational-PTSD, I have these triggers ALL of the time and I\u2019m in individual counseling for myself because I was also diagnosed with severe BPD(a narcs DREAM personality type btw).\n\nThat said, since I\u2019ve not been able to properly heal, due to his continuous lying, making me think I\u2019m crazy, changing his stories etc...I know that I\u2019m VERY vulnerable, have low self esteem and I truly don\u2019t trust my own judgement(I mean, I went over a decade and never suspected that he wasn\u2019t who he portrayed himself to be) how could I trust my judgement right now?\n\nI want to believe his \u201cfull discourse\u201d and move on BUT something is holding me back(along with having to question my past, present AND future) I\u2019m just TERRIFIED that he\u2019s doing ALL of this, in order to keep me around and I don\u2019t know HOW I\u2019m going to EVER truly believe that he loves me and wants to be with me for reasons OTHER than what I can do for HIM.\n\n\nI\u2019ll never in my life understand how he could watch me slowly break down into NOTHING, watch me slowly die inside from the pain, KNOWING that ALL I need in order to heal(and have some security), was for HIS honesty and for him to put ME first for ONCE.....yet...he still let it go on for months and months.\n\n\nHow can you do that to someone who you claim to love SO deeply??\n\nAll that said:\n\n\nHOW do I know for 100% CERTAIN that he\u2019s not just \u201choovering\u201d me in a desperate attempt to keep me as his \u201cmain supply?\u201d\n\nHOW do I tell the difference between him being genuine OR him using his \u201cperfected acting skills\u201d?? \n\nMore importantly, HOW do I know that once he\u2019s \u201ccomfortable\u201d he won\u2019t get bored again and allow his own selfish wants/needs to win over?\n\nCan someone like him TRULY change, or is it ALL temporary??\n\n\nI know that healing takes time and mine has been severely delayed (since he hasn\u2019t wanted to be honest until recently) I am just SO damn scared that, I\u2019ll let my guard down to work on things with him and BOOM 5 years down the line, it happens ALL over again(Lord knows he\u2019s also perfected his ability to hide shit and could teach a class on it)\n\n\nIf ANY of you have advice, or input(regardless of whether it\u2019s positive or not) I need to hear the truth and from folks who have already gone thru this, who are currently going thru a situation like this, OR even from an actual narcissist themselves.\n\nI don\u2019t know where to turn and would appreciate it more than I could EVER convey\u2764\ufe0f", "subreddit": "NarcissisticAbuse"}

I moved out 2 years ago. However, I haven\u2019t been able to fully escape, because we have two small children together. Two small children I now realize were both a part of his plan for control. If I go against anything he says, he leaves me alone with the children, in spite of knowing how anxious I become with them. If we fight, he calls me the most terrible things I have never even heard from my worst enemy. Things get physical when the children aren\u2019t around. Thing is, I feel like I\u2019ve adapted several of his narc traits. When we argue, when he screams at me to shut the fuck up and listen, I begin name calling and belittling. I feel like I\u2019m no better than him, however part of me believes I\u2019ve developed these traits as a means of survival. He constantly tells me I need to seek help because of my \u201cepisodes\u201d. However, I only treat HIM this way. I feel like I\u2019m treating him as I am treated. I caught him on Tinder. Multiple times. They were all MY fault because I wasn\u2019t giving myself to him multiple times a day (I was). I set simple boundaries, such as DONT wake me up for sex in the night. I have to be up when baby wakes, and also up early for work. Of course he says it\u2019s his right to have sex with his girlfriend whenever he sees fit. I know I need to get out. I want to be free of him. I have my own place, work a full time job at the daycare my children attend, and get no monetary support from him. I just can\u2019t seem to get a jump start on it because I know NC isn\u2019t really feasible because of our children. The guilt weighs heavy on me anytime I do try, and I always lose to his hoovering. I\u2019m extremely weak. I feel hopeless. It\u2019s up to me to leave and I\u2019m choosing to stay because I know he won\u2019t help with the kids if I end it completely. The logical side of me says okay, they\u2019d be better off without him in that case. But the trauma bonded monster side of me says I can\u2019t do this without him. I know I deserve better. I know the kids will grow older and recognize his behavior. The trauma bond is so strong that I\u2019ve looked past him having a year long affair, a meth problem, beating me so bad I wound up with staples in my head. Anytime he\u2019s hurt me, it\u2019s always always \u201cself defense\u201d. I know for a fact I\u2019ve never laid a hand on him first, but I have fought back. So when he hurts me, and doesn\u2019t leave a mark, but he has a black eye from me standing up for myself, he tells people I\u2019ve been beating him for years, and that he\u2019s the abused one. I\u2019m sorry this is all over the place.. I just so so badly want my peace and happiness back. I\u2019m a shell of who I once was. I bent until I broke, molding myself into the person he expected me to be. It was never enough. He\u2019s a textbook narcissist, and I\u2019d even go as far to say a sociopath. 2 years ago we \u201cseparated\u201d. We were to work on ourselves then move back in together. 20 days into this separation, he met a woman and discarded me. For 6 months, I was drinking so much I blacked out at night, just to avert my thoughts from focusing on him. I met someone after that 6 months. I didn\u2019t reach out to my narc anymore. Someone was making me happy. He caught wind of it and lovebombed his way back, telling me he made a mistake with this woman and just wanted his family back. All while never even leaving her to begin with. Told me everything I wanted to hear, made sure I ended my new relationship, and cheated on me for a year. I didn\u2019t find out until towards the end. He was asking his affair partner to call my job and try to get me fired, asked her to falsely report me to DFS, was telling her he had to keep her a secret, otherwise I\u2019d take our daughter. By the time all of this came to light, he had already gotten me pregnant with daughter number two. He had sworn he found out he was sterile. He was and still is, telling people out four month old doesn\u2019t belong to him. She 100% does. I stayed even after the affair came to light, thus showing him no matter how wrong he does me, I\u2019ll never go anywhere. In fact, his affair partner showed me a text of him blatantly saying \u201cshe\u2019ll never do anything, she won\u2019t go anywhere\u201d about me. I\u2019m so ashamed of myself for allowing this treatment for so many years. The thought of my children being in a relationship a fraction of this abusive, brings me to tears. If we didn\u2019t have any children, I would be gone no problem. But he knows that I know he won\u2019t be around for his kids if I leave, so he banks on that to keep me around. I cry to myself every single day because I\u2019m settling for way less than I deserve, because we have these children. I know I\u2019m doing them more harm than good by staying. I know who he is and what he\u2019s about. He\u2019s shown his true colors. He once told me he hopes I crash my car, smash through the windshield, get decapitated, and somehow remember it. That no one will ever want my nasty ass. That I\u2019m a no good whore that will suck any swinging dick that comes my way, as long as they tell me I\u2019m pretty. I know I don\u2019t deserve this, and I know there\u2019s men out there that will never make me feel like a fucking toy on a shelf. I need help. I want my life back. I\u2019ve tried therapy, but had bad luck. My situation was so extreme, that even the therapist kind of acted like I was an idiot for being unable to leave. I know there\u2019s other therapists, but I have no insurance of any kind any longer. It\u2019s an awful feeling being ready to go, ready to experience life again, knowing what I have to do, but being scared to execute anything. I know I\u2019ll miss him and reach out. I always do. Always chasing that high of how he made me feel in the beginning.. even though I know that was never real. That he knew I\u2019d be chasing after that. That he knew it was just a mask until he was sure I was committed and in love. But when I do leave.. the guilt he lays on gets me every time. He threatens to keep the kids from me if I dare end the relationship. I just want my fucking peace. I want to breathe. Any words of wisdom.. anything helps. I try to listen to these calls between he and I that I\u2019ve recorded... but end up just blaming myself for how the conversation went. Most of them are me crying and trying to explain something and being told \u201cblah blah blah, shut the fuck up and listen to me, bitch. We aren\u2019t talking about that right now so cut your fake ass crybaby bullshit out\u201d. The crazy making is real. I\u2019m scared to death that I myself am a narc. When people cry or get visibly upset, I don\u2019t know what to do. I don\u2019t feel empathy for them. I feel numb. I don\u2019t even offer hugs or comfort when i see someone other than my children crying. I call my narc names all the time, belittle him... it\u2019s like I try to treat him as I\u2019m treated. I try to make him hate me so much that HE leaves, because I know he won\u2019t feel any guilt about it. If you\u2019ve read this... I truly appreciate you.", "subreddit": "NarcissisticAbuse"}

Narc wants to take credit for everything I've accomplished after leaving him, my love of cause and effect is seeing his \"logic\" as logical.", "author": "vampedvixen", "self_text": "I recently saw my ex again. He's a mess. An absolute mess-- he doesn't talk to anyone anymore (even family and neighbors he used to get along with so well), he has lost over $100k because of bad financial moves, he has a really shitty job driving a golf cart around a flea market that's only open two days a week, he's depressed as all fuck, no love life for several years now (if you discount me popping over after year or so to \"catch up\" like I'm an idiot), his house is a mess because he can't be half-assed to do anything about his hoarding, he isn't motivated to do anything to change and basically is resigned to just give up at the age of 49 because he kinda knows he can't fix anything easily. Now he just drinks, smokes, goes on racist rants, hoards guns and weapons, only leaves his house to go to work or go to the shooting range, has gone pretty alt-right in views and is just completely washed up. When I left him the first time many years ago I would have laughed if I knew he was going to end up like this-- now I just pity him. A lot. I'm also like... really afraid of him lately. The way he talks about his weapons and of how much the world needs to be destroyed just gives me goosebumps. He was always verbally/emotionally violent (with some physical violence in minor ways like grabbing or keeping me from leaving or being violent towards material objects).  \n\n\nAnyway, when I was there a few months ago, he went on this rant about how everything good in my life was due to his actions. He \"let me go\" when I moved several states away after living together (note: this was because I was afraid of his abusive nature). By letting me go, I had been able to create a good career for myself, grow up (I was very dependent on him when we lived together and happily I've figured out how to adult now), create new friendships, go on lavish vacations (I was on vacation when I met up with him this past time and since I wanted to be nice and knew he was down on his luck I treated him to a lot of dinners/theme park tickets/ect). And in his rant, it was all because of him. Because he didn't even try to \"win me back\" when I left. He had \"made the right call\" and \"let me go\". And I apparently should be grateful to all he put me through because I had come out of it a strong woman (funny thing is he's completely misogynistic except when I'm the one picking up the tab) and without him \"pushing me\" I never would have succeeded at anything in life. All my sacrifices were things that he put me through.   \n\n\nI want to be like \"well, fucktard, yeah, I succeeded because I left you, I didn't want to end up being abused every day and treated like shit as you spent all our money in this podunk town in Florida\" but my head keeps leaning towards the cause and effect route of thinking that if he hadn't been in my life things would have turned out so different. I've always believed even the smallest chance meetings with people can change your world forever. And now here I am feeling like everything in my life is the result of him. I hate it. I feel like any success I have now will always be tainted with the feeling of it being his success because he made the choice not to try to win me back and let me go live my life.   \n\n\nAlso, just on a side note, I ended up talking to his neighbor recently. I was trying to return something his neighbor had given me because I didn't want any ties to my ex anymore. His neighbor and I (who have only really met briefly) ended up getting into a conversation about my ex. Turns out the neighbor (who used to be good friends with my ex) is done with him too. Apparently, when the neighbor saw my ex screaming at my ex's mother the neighbor realized how disrespectful my ex is towards women. The neighbor (who is 77 year old man from Florida, so I thought he was way more conservative than this) pleaded with me not to go back to my ex again because he actually feared for my safety. Again, I reiterate that the neighbor only met me twice but he was so afraid for me that he continuously said that my ex was going to eventually explode and hurt someone \"very badly\" and the neighbor didn't want that someone to be me. The neighbor told me I deserved someone who respected ANYONE. I ended up crying and the words \"he's not well\" just fell out of my mouth and the neighbor was like \"well, obviously. Yeah.\" It meant a lot to me that after years of living next to my ex, after only meeting me twice the neighbor was completely on my side and trying to actually protect me. My ex is like an addiction and I've often said that I know he's going to end up killing me someday, but I'm really going to try to remember what his neighbor said to me. Okay, this last part is probably just ranting, but I have very few people I can talk to about this lately and I needed to put it in writing.", "subreddit": "NarcissisticAbuse"}

It also implies how to get better if you happen to be affected: Remove assholes from your life.\n\n\nRealizing this makes me feel a little more understood by humanity in general again :) If this saying could get so popular, it probably means that many people can intuitively understand what we are going through.", "subreddit": "NarcissisticAbuse"}

Absolutely. I wasn't about to bring my past to a new relationship like that, even if I did have trauma, and believe me I have.\n\nI've never been more anxious or depressed in a relationship because of my partner. I've never had a partner make me feel like such shit before. I always told her how I felt and I think she took that as me trying to manipulate her into staying when I was just trying to express my feelings.\n\nLook, the sex was incredible and I felt like I could really be with her. I had my own shit with booze (never aggressive just comatose, sometimes manic).

I really hope you can stay with me because I really need some clarity on what happened to me.\n\nHello, I \\[M27\\] was in a long distance situationship with a girl\\[F27\\] from my country but from a different state. We broke 4 months ago because she suddenly got into another LDR with a guy\\[M23\\] from another country.\n\nWe weren't really exclusive but at the same time we weren't really looking for someone else. There were \"I love yous\" and we spent a lot of time together watching videos, movies, chatting, sexting... She was aware that I didn't want a serious relationship because I really needed a proper job and I didn't have enough money to completely reciprocate the amount of things she wanted to do for me. She was the one who came to visit me and with the money I had I paid the food and the fun things we did together. In fact, she was the one who proposed to be in this type of relationship and I agreed with her because I really liked her and always had a good time whenever she came to visit.\n\nOn september, she decided to end our situationship. I understood the circumstances she explained to me and agreed with her. We decided to stay as friends because, in her words, \"she still considered me her soulmate and her best friend\".She didn't talk to me as much as she used to, though. I didn't either because it was kind of akward after all the time we spent together. I was trying to get used to all of this.That same week, she posted a pic of herself in a videocall with a guy she met in an online game on her twitter. Then I kinda realized what was happening: She started ignoring me not because she felt akward like myself but because she was spending her time with another guy.I know we weren't exclusive but all of this was so sudden and hit me hard. Just some days ago we were still saying \"I love you\" to each other, spending time together and having fun like nothing, and suddenly she is now focusing all of her attention to this guy she just met. I decided to block her and go no contact because I couldn't be her friend when I still had feelings for her and apparently she feels nothing for me anymore just like that.\n\nI didn't know about love bombing until recently and realized that my ex did that when we met.She wanted to buy me gifts all the time. She even offered to have sex with me because she wanted me to be her first time. She said she could use her mouth only if I didn't want to have actual sex. At that point in time, we haven't even met once. She was still planning to come to visit because she was coming to an anime convention and tried to have sex with me on that same visit. She was aware that I was still recovering from another break up, my first ex cheated on me and I was trying to heal. I used to tell her all the time that she needed to value herself more, to save money and to focus on herself, but she never listened.\n\nWhen we broke, she put the blame on me. She told me that she sacrificed a lot for me and I didn't do the same for her. She was aware of my personal issues and the problems I had at home, and still blamed me. She used to tell me stuff like \"I don't care about the money I spend because it makes me happy to see you\", \"I love to buy you things because it makes me happy\". After reading those lines, I just realized how it was always about herself. She did all of that because it made her happy, she idealized me because she found value on herself by being with me. And still, she blamed me, even though she specified she did all of that on her own, not because I told her to or because I asked to...\n\nThen she started saying things like \"I need to value myself more. That's why I'm dating someone else who actually loves me\". I was the one who told her to focus more on herself, to value herself more, to stop wasting money on me like it was nothing, and suddenly I am the bad guy who made her sacrifice a lot and she is the one \"healing\" after all of that, not me. She is healing with a new love. She is now finally enjoying the happy life she always wanted, even if she haven't met this new guy in person yet...\n\nI don't really know if she is a narc or not, but I think she is really codependent.Sometimes she contacts me through telegram asking if I'm fine because she is worried about me. She says she still wants to be my friend. I just... can't understand how after all the time we spent together she can be like \"let's be friends, but I'm dating someone else so deal with that\", as if I didn't feel a thing...\n\nThe funny part is she decided to give a chance to this new guy because he love bombed her too... This guy promised her to move with her if she gave him a chance on the first week they met, he says she is perfect and says \"she is the girl of his dreams\", \"you are fun and play the games I like, you are perfect!\". She says she wanted to give him a chance because of how much he reminds her of how she used to act with me.\n\nI don't really know what is happening. Is she a narc? Is she just codependent? Is the guy she is dating now a narc too? Can a narc date a narc?Was it really my fault? I tried to make her happy even if we weren't exclusive. I gave what I could in the relationship. She was aware of my situation, she was aware of my problems and I tried to give her gifts too, tried to make her happy, tried to make her feel loved, and it wasn't enough... How can she start dating someone else like nothing? How can she want to stay as my friend as if everything that happened between us had never happened?\n\nIt has been 4 months already and I still feel so fucking broken inside. I can't sleep properly, I wake after 5 hours feeling cold and anxious, every single day since that... I feel so replaced, I feel like all the times I spent the night chatting with her when she felt sad or when her parents mistreated her meant nothing. All the help and fun times we had together mean nothing now that she is dating someone else. How can she say I was her soulmate and then treat me like that? What is going on? Was I really that bad of a person?\n\nI'm really sorry for all this venting. I can't currently pay for therapy. I already paid for one a month ago but I think it didn't help at all, and right now all I can do is vent here. Thanks for reading this if you did.", "subreddit": "NarcissisticAbuse"}

Not going to lie, I was nervous, but as I sat in the waiting room an immense feeling of strength washed over me. I am so proud that I am putting myself first now. It\u2019s an odd feeling to have to introduce yourself to... yourself. But this is where I\u2019m at at the age of 29 and I\u2019m doing the best I can. I\u2019m living with my parents and trying to rebuild my life after being abused by my STBXH for the past 6 years. I have been brain washed to think that my feelings, opinion, and view on reality either didn\u2019t matter or simply did not exist enough to have any bearing on my own life let alone his. \n\nI didn\u2019t think I was going to get much from the first session because I figured it would be me just regurgitating everything that I\u2019ve gone through in a semi coherent matter. As I was trying to justify that I needed to know if I was going to walk into a room that was full of broken glass, even though all he had broken was a glass straw. And when I was in my court hearing for my permanent protective order I was recounting my experience of him lighting a stream of propane on fire and pointing it towards me and our house, I thought it was a 5 foot long stream of fire but he said in the court that it wasn\u2019t possible. (The point in his mind being if it wasn\u2019t possible to be 5 feet long then all of her statement is a lie, therefore letting him off on everything.) she finally asked me to stop and said \u201cit didn\u2019t matter if you had walked into your house and he had shattered every glass in your home or you walked in and he had shattered JUST a glass straw. It didn\u2019t matter if the stream of fire was 5 ft long, 3 ft long, or 2 ft. His actions made you feel unsafe. The details don\u2019t matter. He made you feel unsafe and that\u2019s what matter\u201d\n\nIn that statement so much pent up anxiety was released because i could finally let go of justifying things endlessly in my mind. The gaslighting is brutal because in that court room when he lied in front of the judge, it made me question my feelings again. Even after being no contact up until that point. I know it may sound simple but for someone like me, who has been made to feel insignificant, it was significant. \n\nHis behavior, abuse, and rages - they made me feel unsafe. I am justified in divorcing him for that. Even though he thinks the statement of \u201cwell, I never hit her\u201d invalidates my leaving and justifies everything he did, and he thinks \u201cShe is blowing things out of proportion.\u201d I am justified in feeling angry. I have a right to feel safe in my own home even if I don\u2019t have one right now. \n\nI\u2019m very much so looking forward to the rest of my sessions and the rest of my life where I will always choose my life over his.", "subreddit": "NarcissisticAbuse"}

Their goal was to hurt you.\n\nIt can be so hard to heal the connection to the abuser(s) because you keep replaying the trauma in your head over and over again. You, especially, imagine yourself making different choices or doing something else to avoid the abuse. If only you could have said or done this the abuse would have stopped. It would have never happened. \n\nI just want to hug you and tell you not to critique yourself so. You were your natural, loving, generous, optimistic true-self. You generously gave your attention and space to this person because you believe in the beauty and opportunity for openness and sharing in the world. You never would have imagined that someone would take advantage of that in such a malicious, covert way. There is a reason why the abuse happened, and it\u2019s not because you made the wrong choices. You were targeted by someone whose goal was to hurt you. They would have done it to you or to the next person just the same, no matter what choices the subject of abuse made. You were sought out for your beauty, wisdom, intelligence, kindness, patience, and love. You were sought out as the disease-carrying mosquito flies furiously to the glow of white light, the pulse of warm, red blood, life force. You are the light. So do not exhaust yourself so, wondering how you could have covered the bright beams that emit from within. Forgive yourself. It was not your fault. You did not cause or inspire the insidious nature of the abuser.\n\nThe best way to let go is to forgive yourself and life for what you\u2019ve been through. It brought an awareness that will not go in vain. Realize your worth and your truth. Value  that which makes up your uniqueness. You are worthy of respect and love right now and have always been and always will be. The more you forgive yourself and make central the good nature that you posses, the more you will align and accept the truth. The truth is that you are free and safe to be yourself. You have a right to exclusively align with those who match your true-self. Connect more deeply to your nature without shyness and without apology. Those who are in line will signal out their presence like beacons. Be proud of yourself. Be kind to yourself. Others who can respectfully relate will follow.", "subreddit": "NarcissisticAbuse"}

I believe my ex might only have been temporarily a narc during our LDR. I was with my ex for 6 years and half of those years were unfortunately some of the best years of my life. He was kind, honorable, honest, generous and everything I could hope for in a guy. Our families got along. Every friend I knew loved him and would vouch for his character. He was even admitted to a hospital once for intervening when a gang of bullies was harassing a woman on Christmas day. He did charities and led many church groups. But we went LDR when he pursued a PhD, and after half a year, he displayed many symptoms of narcissism. He complained he was cut off from his friends and family. He would constantly complain of loneliness, and that I should move over. That a lot of women kept contacting him. And that his work was stressful. He blamed his loneliness on me. We broke up after I found out he was cheating on me with a number of women at his Uni. He was apologetic and eventually confessed to every thing when I confronted him. I pegged him for a narcissist which I read was incurable. He checked nearly all the boxes for narcissism in the three years we were apart.\n\nIt's been more than a year since and I found out from a mutual friend he's been seeing a therapist who happened to be an expert in narcissistic partners. While the therapist wouldn't share any information with me about his case, she says people with narcissistic disorders do not seek help on their own volition, or want to change. She laments that Google is good for diagnosing simple medical disorders, but not for complex mental disorders. It's a spectrum, and most of us are narcissists to some extent. She says it only becomes a disorder when it's on the very high end of the spectrum. She says that we often try to label exes to explain terrible situations but that thinking denies the complexity of human emotions, and prevents us from learning from our past because we don't take responsibility for our own failures as well. The idea that a good man can also be deceptive and evil scares us.\n\nI was so sure he was a narc during the LDR. Every horror story others told reminded me so much of him. But now that I think back, he took all the blame for our break up and confessed to everyone that he cheated on me. He was actually the one who told my parents, although it was an accident as he thought they knew. I was tearing his reputation apart and he never retaliated and just kept apologising to me. I thought it was a narcissistic game he was playing. Finally, after I refused to get back together again, he apologised one last time, wished me all the best and blocked me from all communication. I thought this was a hoover, but he has never tried contacting me once after the break up, and friends say he just wants to move on as talking to me only reminds him of the pain. He's with someone else now. I don't know if they're happy.\n\nCan narcissism be temporary? Or did I diagnose my ex incorrectly? Are we maybe too quick to rely on Dr. Google for diagnosing our partners? If so, should I apologise or move on?", "subreddit": "NarcissisticAbuse"}

We dated from the end of July '18 to mid December '18.  \n\nWe met via OLD and things went 0-60 in record time.  Looking back,  I was just following his lead.  The love bombing was so over the top but I let myself drown in it because it was incredible and like nothing I had ever experienced before.  I even ignored blatant red flags.  \n\nA month into it I was his soul mate.  2 months into it he started talking about moving in together the following summer when my lease was up (but I'd have to move to his town, transfer job sites and commute everyday). I wasn't on board with this but he continued to bring it up once in awhile saying \"we both know where this is going...\"  He was subtly controlling. \n\n3 months in the love bombing continued. I had started to feel smothered - he wanted to be there for me all.the.time. When I expressed my frustration,  it was met with the ol \"I just love you SO much and just want to be there for you\" followed by \"if you want me to go and never contact you again,  it will break my heart but I will do it for you\". I made a mental note of that red flag but we talked through it and all was good.  A week later a rediculous jealousy?  issue caused him to have another melt down.  All because I joked that if Ed Sheeran knocked on my door I'd let him in.  Holy shit.... he spun that into me thinking a bar tender at the local watering hole was cute and wanting to sleep with him.  It was so over the top ridiculous.  He apologized profusely the next day,  saying he was embarrassed and didn't know why he reacted like he did.  I was pissed and started pulling away.  \n\nThere were lots of good and fun times with sprinkles of wtf reactions and comments.  He even began to talk about engagement rings,  asking what style of rings I like etc.  Just so he had an idea.  I told him this gave me anxiety and I was no where close to wanting to get married again. Needless to say that didn't go over very well. \n\nA couple weeks later I had been feeling under the weather.  I told him this and just layed low for a few days.  He became very persistent with texting me constantly,  wanting to know what he could do to help.  I snapped back at him. This brought on meltdown #3 and I said and ended the relationship. I went no contact. \n\nHe continued to blow up my phone for a month.  At one point even reaching out to my friend to find out what caused me to break his heart and shatter him like I did. \n\nIt wasn't until a couple months after this that I heard the term \"love bombing\" and read about Narcissism.  It described him and what he did to a T.\n\nI can't seem to let this go and put it behind me as an important lesson learned.  I'm angry at myself for seeming allowing him to manipulate me.  I'm angry that I didn't defend my boundaries when he pushed right through them.  I AM glad that I did remain somewhat guarded during the relationship and didn't share certain things with him.  He kept pushing to meet my adult children and my Father and Brother.  Something kept me from making that happen no matter how much and hard he pushed for it.  \n\nSooooo back to the title of this... HOW do I once and for all put out behind me and move forward.

A week later, he suddenly wanted an Apple Watch after spending years denouncing them and being uninterested. \n\nHe would still claim that my daughter was being left in her crib and I would say that\u2019s a serious charge, we should buy a Nanit or some other video baby monitor. (I eventually told him I never wanted to hear him say that shit to me ever again or I would leave him. For some reason it worked.) He\u2019s a tightwad unless it\u2019s an electronic device for himself or impress someone so he wouldn\u2019t agree to buy a fancy camera. I finally repurposed a camera we had as a baby monitor and only saw my daughter waking and self soothing back to sleep as she went through different sleep cycles overnight, sleeping perfectly developmentally appropriate amounts of hours. Strange how he didn\u2019t want to get proof of his horrid lazy stay at home wife neglecting their baby. (I realize it\u2019s probably a dig at my hearing loss for which I wear hearing aids, as well, but the sound of my daughter\u2019s cry electrifies something in me and I couldn\u2019t ever sleep through it. But he doesn\u2019t feel that. Scary.)", "subreddit": "NarcissisticAbuse"}

He was really manipulative, emotionally abusive, verbally abusive, and sexually abusive. He\u2019s also incredibly immature and childish.\n\n[Context] So before we broke up, we were on a \u201cbreak\u201d. I had been wanting to break up with him for months, since prom and my birthday (stories for another time), but I never could because he would constantly tell me how he wanted to kill himself every time I told him when he hurt me. I could NEVER talk about my feelings around him, because it would turn into a pissing contest of sadness or him getting overly upset that I was upset. He also struggles with his own mental health issues and problems, which is fine, but he would weaponize them against me(also stories for another time). I sacrificed my own mental health so many times for his bitchass, 9/10 times I was there for him even if I felt like I was fucking dying inside. I always put him before myself, which is not healthy. Like he would guilt trip me if I didn\u2019t want to have sex with him, AND IT WORKED! He struggles with a little bit of substance and addiction, nothing *super* serious like heroin, but HEAVY pot smoker and nicotine user. While we were dating, he was cutting down on both of those, he wanted to quit nicotine completely by our anniversary (11/13), but we broke up before then. He didn\u2019t quit lol. \n\nAnyway, after we broke up, he would text me a lot. I\u2019ll try to post some screenshots, but tl;dr the first one was \u201cbe my friend\u201d. I didn\u2019t respond. The second one was \u201cok well I tried to be your friend but you don\u2019t want to be an adult and talk to me. Blah blah blah I\u2019m removing you from my snap and deleting your contact info blah\u201d. I responded with something along the lines of \u201csorry I just thought we broke up. Have a nice life tho\u201d. End of that, right? Of course not. Dude says something along the lines of trying to be nice or whatever, I don\u2019t respond from that point on.\n\nLater that night, I posted a meme on my spam that said \u201cjust because you\u2019ve been traumatized doesn\u2019t mean you can traumatize others. Mental illness doesn\u2019t give you an excuse to be shitty\u201d \nHe texts me AGAIN. Writes me a goddamn novel. Claims I\u2019m trying to fuck with his head, that his therapist told him to try and be my friend but I won\u2019t be an adult (guess she didn\u2019t tell him to respect my choices lol), how he doesn\u2019t appreciate it, etc. He makes a post on his spam, caption says something like \u201cif you\u2019re out of my life it\u2019s for a reason. I been quiet about a lot of shit blah\u201d I didn\u2019t even think it was about me, like first of all, bitch, I broke up with you. Second of all, I made you a much better person. I pushed you to achieve your goals. Finally, ok fine say some shit then. What dirt do you have on me? You barely fucking graduated high school, got busted with a shitton of weed, you\u2019re going fucking nowhere, your mom takes responsibility for everything you do, what the fuck do you have to say about me? My ACT score is higher than your fucking IQ. \n\nI ignore it though. I don\u2019t say anything. However, one of my friend\u2019s friends is starting to fuck with my ex. My friend warns her, like \u201chey. This dude is crazy and manipulative.\u201d I didn\u2019t even know about this. The night before thanksgiving, ex sends me a scathing message, telling me to \u201cget out of his life\u201d and stop telling people he\u2019s crazy and manipulative, best of all, that I\u2019m \u201cno better then one of his school bullies\u201d (his grammar has never been...amazing). He ALSO texts my mom! I didn\u2019t really see what he said to her but it was basically \u201ctell your daughter to stop talking about me\u201d. Both my mother and I blocked him at that point. \n\nHe makes me livid. He\u2019s so fucking entitled it\u2019s laughable. Imagine what a nice life it\u2019d be to live being THAT unaware of yourself. He acts like he deserves my fucking friendship or some sort of niceness from me when he deserves to get his fucking tires slashed. He made me cry so much. I forgave him over and over and over and over again. It got to the point where I was severely depressed. I probably would\u2019ve killed myself had it not been for my therapist and support network. That\u2019s not an exaggeration, it got to the point where I was dragging a toothpick across my thighs hard enough to scar for a month or so, but I still have some. It was bad and I hate him. \n\nIn our relationship, it was always what he wanted and after our relationship he was mad because I wasn\u2019t doing what he wanted. He deserves to rot in hell. I want vengeance so bad, I feel like he\u2019s getting away with it. Obviously I won\u2019t do anything, but I have some pretty serious dirt (like he\u2019d get charged with a felony) I could use if I need to. Realistically, I probably won\u2019t, but the sinking feeling in my stomach won\u2019t go away. I want him to feel some sort of consequence for his actions.", "subreddit": "abuse"}

You make me feel like crap. You know you are wrong. You such a bad human being. You make me not trusting you anymore. You hurt me. You such a bad person. All those words make them that they are narcissistic, instead of asking questions with compassion. \"Honey, do you have any reason why you di that? That's ok, we will figure something out. Let's work this together.\" As a compassion person, I will do that to him. And try to understand him. \n\nOne time he told me that I'm mentally ill. I need to go to the hospital and see a doctor. It break my heart that someone that I love would say that to me. It makes me lose myself. When I react on something because he made the decision without asking me. Or disrespect me as his spouse around his friends. He is crossing so many boundaries that I already said. He would make decisions that involving me without asking me first. How can someone be so self-center? That's the question I asked myself everytime. When I made decisions, I would asked him first if that's something that he will be comfortable. I put him first on a lot things. Because I believe if you love someone you put them first. That's how you love someone. But doing that to a narcissist is worst.

My choice, my feeling, and myself don't matter.\n\nI finally out of that life. I'm too exhausted. I'm too tired. I'm out not because I don't love him anymore.

I tried to find the answer to this searching online, but I had no clear answer.\n\nIll try to give a short backgroung and I hope someone can answer my question.  Many years ago I met a guy, we had a 3 year relationship during which he constantly put me down. In the beginning, things progressed very quickly, I felt like I was being rushed and there was something he wanted from me. I just felt empty being with him, but I was also both overwhelmed and really wanted that feeling of being loved, I guess.  Anyway, I stepped into the relationship. I was also very naive,  and really shy - they shyness was probably one of the reasons why I did not really have a relationship till then. He was the first one who was really bold with me. I now realize he was a Red Piller.  He made fun of everything about me,  called me an idiot and used a lot of curse words which I am unaccustomed to. Me trying to explain my rationale only ended with \"you are so stupid\". Im actually a pretty decent, intelligent and attractive  person who was perhaps lacking socially.  I've always felt that I dont need a ton of people around me, just a few good friends.  Also, shortly after we met, I emigrated to another country to continue post grad. in science. so I didnt really see many aspects of him, except his intermittent messages.  My first trip back home, even though I was struggling financially I bought him a lot of expensive stuff (camera, laptop, iphone). which he was supposed to me pay me back for. He never did. Me calling him and asking him for the money because I really needed it only ended in being shouted at and blocked. Eventually he did give me a third of the money back.  At this point we had stopped talking, so I was surprised and thanked him.\n\ntwo years later I heard back from him about how he was missing me, and his life was not going well. He called me and I listened to him, gave him my advice and we started talking.  I realized that he had never changed and gradually phased out of the friendship. But I would still hear from him every now and then. always messages of not doing well. Now,  7 years later, these messages have turned to messages of ruin. - that I had somehow ruined him. And begging me for forgiveness and telling me how much he still loves me, and he has tried to hate me, but he can't.  i decided to end this once and for all. and get things straight with him, and have a real talk.  (In all the years he avoided any talk of confrontation with \"im not well, Im not doign well. I have a thousand worries, my business is bankrupt, etc\". So I would just end up listening to him and counseling him on his affairs.) I asked him to call me so we can go over everythng that happened and why so he can get his head on straight. he refuses to talk to me, tells me he is terrified of me. I decided to just go no contact, but I still get these messages of  how badly he is hurting but he is terrified of me every few days.\n\nThis really puzzles me. In all of my memory. I have been really gentle with this person, giving them advice or just talking.  I can't ever remember doing anything other than just ending the relationship with them.   But if I force myself to remember, I remember the hurt and confusion I had and dealing with it for many years after I ended things with them. He really put me down emotionally so much that I had to seek therapy.  Luckily, Im a person who bounces quickly.   I now realize he was an immature person with very low self esteem, despite the act of braggadocio.   But why do they keep telling me they are terrified of me?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nPlease excuse the rambling post.  I'm happy to answer any questions people have.", "subreddit": "NarcissisticAbuse"}

But it just keeps coming back. I think the \"accept we are all different\" culture in its most radical forms is triggering it in my daily life now. I have taught myself persistently to build boundaries, but sometimes I feel I become too strict and lose my open-mindedness and trust in life with it. Many of my peers say I'm no fun just because I don't want to take risks on their terms but my own, or don't get into social games very often. I do feel I've lost big part of my sense of humor just for having to guard myself for most manipulative people all the time. Those who test my boundaries constantly and excuse them as innocent jokes, or do things that would compromise my sense of security, while for them it's just living according to different values and not caring how their actions or words affected my well being. If it were just innocent jokes, but some, at least in my past, have escalated into very long-lasting slander campaigns I'm no longer willing to put up with.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOne of these excuse makers was my former friend, whom I feel being a narcissist. They knew I'm more.. stability seeking person, although I have my own occasional mood swings. Usually slowly building ones. I'm more mindful about thrill seeking and relishing it, I still think how my actions could affect me or people I care about, while the narc friend didn't care if their actions made me feel confused, insecure, belittled or that they pulled the rug from under my feet.In my dreams, it visualised as in me driving a car on mountainhills for excitement and when the narc friend came into the picture, they'd suggest me to drive the car into a nearby muddy river for more excitement. \"Trust there will be a crane to pick it back up for you.\" they said. \"But how will my car work after it's been in the muddy water?\" I wondered, which the narc friend wouldn't respond to. I was boring to them apparently. In the dream I saw a flash of \"if I drive this car into the water, the friend will just walk off unimpressed before any crane shows up, not providing helping hand or anything after seeing the entertainment\". So I didn't do it but continued following the narrow mountainroad. But I feel the dream described my and the narc friend's relationship perfectly. The narc friend would excuse all this bad advice, manipulativeness and reckless thrill seeking with different life values and that I was just too narrow minded, boring and judgemental of difference. But I would've lost the car while they wouldn't have lost nothing! How's that boring, narrow minded or judgemental? Would they drive their own car into muddy water, figuratively, I wonder...\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe other example is another... person. This one felt like an abusive one although we share some values. This one is about honesty.\n\nFor me honesty is to mean what you say, stick to it unless proven wrong and trying to see outside your opinion without necessarily having to change it. It also means if someone tells me about something sensitive, I'll drag those secrets to grave. I don't mind if people disagree with me as long as it's not used as an excuse to pressure or manipulate me into doing something I don't want to do. I also let people speak their mind even if it didn't always please me or make me feel good, but certainly I don't want to take any shit like disrespect or outright dismissal.\n\nThe other person... well, is very extreme about freedom of speech. If someone calls me honest, they gotta be brutally honest. They would let their words sting, like they will publicly dismiss, disrespect and shame people in situations where it's not really called for. I met them on forums and tried to \"raise cat on the table\" about something that had been making me uncomfortable. This freedom of speech extremist has always thwarted my efforts by coming in provoking me about my known sensitive spots, or just shaming me about not getting it and how my attempts to be heard are in vain.. while saying little to the actual point I was trying to make. Ofc they wouldn't want their opinions to be evaluated the same way they are evaluation my opinions. I felt this was verbally abusive but they excuse it with freedom of speech. I never tried to silence them though, just to be heard and have my boundaries respected. I felt they were trying to silence me with that provoking and shaming... like totally mindfucked there. It took me a long time to even realise what they were doing. I left the community so I wouldn't have to deal with them anymore, although I had equal right to be there. Of course this abuse did eventually also make me act in abusive and provocative ways... those I will own. But not having acted in shameful ways. They should've specified why my ways were shameful at least...Sorry I'm rambling here.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOkay, so yeah. I do try keeping an open mind, but the security of doing so with other people is totally drained away. Although there is no absolute universal right and wrong, I feel some shared sense of right and wrong are needed to create sense of unity and repel abuse of freedom and difference. Feels like many people want freedom with no responsibility, benefit for self without consideration of fellow living person. after abuse I've found people who have helped me to heal that faith in life and common understanding, but while still processing...

Our conversation flowed easily, we met quickly for a date, and we were both hooked. We were seeing each other multiple days a week and exchanging long text messages throughout the day, getting to know each other. She wasn't sure what she was looking for since she was in grad school and would likely be moving after the Summer, but I really enjoyed her company so I went with the flow. Eventually she opened and told me she was living with her ex, who she'd broken up with a little over a month before we met. She assured me there were no feelings, the relationship had been dead for a long time, and that she had a separate bedroom; they were basically just roommates. I appreciated that she was honest, and it made me comfortable trusting her that she was able to be upfront about it. I have trust issues from previous relationships and infidelity is a major worry of mine. Everything was great for a couple months. \n\nThere was only one real event that bothered me, which happened in early December. She had a friend who had graduated school already coming into town to visit, and a bunch of people were all going getting together to make dinner at another friend's house. She told me about it and invited me. She also told me she was picking up this friend from the airport. At this point I knew it was a guy, because she would always use \"she\" with a girl and \"they\" for guys. I didn't mind. She was definitely texting way less than normal that day, and I figured it was because she was with the friend she hadn't seen for a while. I go to meet up with her and everyone at the house that night for the dinner. The first thing I notice is that this guy is being confrontational; not in a direct sense, but he's cold and giving the minimal amount of courtesy to me. He's extremely focused on my ex, and doing things like asking her to get him stuff even though other people are already closer. During the dinner conversation, it comes out that during their day, she took him to an ice cream spot in the city with the airport, where I took her on a date recently. She left that part out when I asked what she did all day, and quickly changed the subject when he brought it up at dinner - acting sketchy about the situation. It also came out that they had a planned one-on-one coffee trip planned in the morning, and the guy shut down another friend that asked if he could join up. When we both had to leave, we were talking in her car, and the guy was messaging her right away asking her to come back in. I had worries, but I didn't want to seem insecure and controlling, so I didn't bring it up.\n\nAfter that, everything was great until January. We were happy, officially together, and had exchanged \"I love you's\". She had issues opening up, and sharing her feelings, which I was trying to work through. I did push too hard for it, probably to the point of making her uncomfortable, but I believed open communication is an important part of the relationship. One day she was shutting down and wouldn't tell me what was wrong. We started talking about it and she told me there were things she didn't feel I needed to know and she didn't share them with me because of that. For some reason at this point, I asked about the guy from the dinner party back in December. It turns out that he did have feelings for her. At the coffee shop date, he'd given her a gift and a note expressing his feelings for her. She says she didn't realize what he was saying at the time. She said she later turned him down in her text messages when he asked about it, that she didn't reciprocate the same feelings. They still hung out that weekend, went to a bar and went dancing as a group (she said she was too drunk to remember if she danced with him), and she tried to meet up with him one more time before he left to talk about the note, but it didn't work out. This is where my anxiety over infidelity came online. I got upset about the situation and not being told, and then asked if she had ever cheated before in a relationship. She told me she had cheated during her last relationship, on her ex that she'd been living with. They had been together for 4 years and she ended up sleeping with another guy within the first month of going to a Summer internship. She says her previous relationship had been on and off, that they were growing apart; that it was loveless - but it was still cheating to me regardless of reasons. She didn't want to end it with him over text so she continued sleeping with the guy and ended it when she got back. She said it was the biggest mistake of her life, that it made her miserable, and that she would never make a mistake like that again. That all happened less than two months before we met.\n\nI was crushed. I told her my trust in her was severely broken and how much it bothered me to find out that not only was she a cheater, but she'd already pushed inappropriate boundaries in our own relationship. She said she felt at the time that it was too early to share her friends note and confession, and that she'd handled it, so I didn't need to know. I asked her to see her texts with the guy who gave her the note so I could see whether I felt there was anything else going on there. When I read the texts, I saw that she didn't directly shut him down; They just kind of played it off and he even told her \"Don't tell [me] or [her ex] about this\". She had told him she wouldn't, but then she said \"I'm still keeping the note ;)\". I blew up. To me, that said she still had some sort of feelings for him and wasn't willing to set a hard boundary that his behavior was inappropriate. She was keeping a note from him that he expressed his feelings for her, and was given as an intentional attempt to break up our relationship. I spiraled from there. One night at home I looked at her social media and found the guy she had cheated on her ex with. This \"biggest mistake\" that \"made her miserable\" was still on her Facebook and Instagram, and regularly liking her pictures. I asked that she remove him, and at first she said she wasn't comfortable doing that because he may be a colleague in the future. She did eventually remove him at a later point.\n\nAt this point I should have ended it. With my past, I couldn't handle her past. I would always be on edge, and most of all I would yell and start fights with her over her past out of nowhere purely because those feelings would come up again and I couldn't handle them. I had severe insecurity, jealousy, and anger issues.  It was hard for me to reconcile the person I'd been falling in love with being capable of the things she'd done.\n\nAfter that our relationship got hard; it was extremely hot and cold. The highs were high but the lows were super low. She'd tell me she wanted to work on it, but I'd feel like her words and actions didn't match up. She went from showing up for our planned dates early, or even showing up with a little gift if she was late, to showing up 30 minutes late and not texting me at all about it. A lot of the time she'd be extremely cold when she came over. I no longer got kissed at the door when I welcomed her in, she just kind of... showed up. Trying to talk about it would cause her to shut down, and in my desperation for a resolution I'd push and she'd get even more upset. \"Nothing's wrong\" she'd say for the 10th time after sitting on the couch for an entire movie, not even wanting to cuddle. The coldness when *nothing was wrong* became a regular trend.\n\nWith her pushing, I started to go to therapy for my trust and anger issues, and put a lot of effort into becoming better. It was slow, but I felt I was making progress. We went from fighting multiple times a week, to once a week, to less than that, but she would always hold the past fights as proof that things weren't getting better. Even fights that she started would become a mark against me in my efforts to improve. Sure, I didn't start the fight, but in her view I didn't de-escalate it so it still got put on me. Everything was on me. At this point in the relationship, I was almost exclusively the one giving affection, I was the one making plans, I was the one trying to hold this together while she just spent time \"hoping things got better\". In her words, just being there was showing she was trying.\n\nI was miserable but I loved her, and I *just knew* that if we could just get past it, we'd be able to get back to the relationship I had before, with the girl that I loved so much from before. It didn't happen; things kept going downhill. Eventually, in July, we had an argument after she was acting completely disinterested in me during a night out, and then a fight when we got back to her place about it. I left to let her cool off (which she always told me she needed) after she said \"We'll talk about it later\" and waited for her to reach out to me. I took a trip to another state to go hiking and hit some breweries to take my mind off of it.\n\nDuring this time, she spent time with another guy I had expressed worries to about before that she told me was \"just a friend\". In their time together, they drank a lot and apparently held hands the night after I left. When I got back on Sunday, I messaged her asking if she wanted to talk and she said it was over. By the way - she had already set up a date with this guy for that day, unbeknown to me. Later that night she messages me and asks me to meet her for a drink and I go. She went a date with this guy and then felt sad so she reached out to me, and me, like an idiot, thought maybe she wanted to reconcile. After the bar we talked a bit, but she was insistent it was over. I got the feeling that there may have been something else going on so I kept asking, and she insisted there wasn't. I went to meet her after she broke up with me, because she told me she was sad, and she still lies right to my face just hours after going on a date with another guy. Two days later it was my birthday and I was drunk and alone, so I asked if I could see her like I'd gone to see her the past Sunday. She didn't see my message until late that night; she had been spending it with him. She had been drinking with, and kissing him on my birthday. Once again when I asked her she said there was nobody else. I asked so many times, and gave her so many chances to be honest with me about it, but she kept lying. Eventually I found out that there was someone else. At first she tried to say it was just a friend, then she said that they were just hooking up and weren't having sex, then later she came back and said \"of course they're having sex\" and denying that she ever said they weren't; constant trickle truth and gaslighting. At this point I couldn't take it anymore. I couldn't take knowing that she'd been lying to me and seeing someone else behind my back, someone she started seeing while we weren't technically over. Someone she jumped to and slept with a week after she did officially end it. I felt worthless and meaningless that she could move on that fast. We went no contact for a while, and she moved to another state that she'd gotten a job in.\n\nA while later, I got an interview for a job I really wanted that happened to be in the same state she was in; I had been applying before when we had been talking about the move. I missed her and reached out to say hi, and we agreed to meet up and see each other. It felt amazing; things clicked, and we were happy to be around each other. She held me that night and was crying, saying \"I love you so much, I miss you so much\", and we ended up having sex. We were both drunk, but in the morning she said she had zero recollection of the night before. We spent the rest of that next day together before I had to go back home. I was feeling a little dejected that the night we spent together wasn't even a memory for her since it felt like she opened up to me so much. After that, we saw each other a couple more times when I had to come down there for work stuff, and once when I flew down just to spend the weekend with her. It was always me making the effort to see her. Especially for the past two months, she would be a lot less communicative than normal. The long texts that we normally exchanged throughout the day would be met by extremely short responses, sometimes just a sentence. I would ask if something was wrong, and she'd say her anxiety was acting up, that she wanted to talk to me, and that she wanted me to keep texting her. It became draining for me, being long distance and having such poor communication from her; it felt like she didn't want to try, but if I backed off on texting to match how she texted, she'd get upset with me. The pressure was all on me to be happy and keep a sense of normalcy while she made minimal efforts. On top of that, at times she would be unnecessarily cruel out of nowhere, making snide and petty remarks. She would become accusatory over past issues I'd proven weren't me time and time again, to the point of interrogating me one night for hours while saying she couldn't trust me no matter what proof I showed her. Another time she began accusing me *again* at a function with former colleagues, to the point that I had to get my old supervisor to unlock my account so I could access my emails and provide evidence. No matter what, she would always try and believe the worst of me.\n\nIt all came to a head this month. We'd been talking about me coming to visit for Christmas since I'm currently working remote and can be anywhere for that. I wanted to try and spend a week with her so we could do the Christmas date activities she'd been telling me she wanted. The first time I asked, I provided a couple different time frames that fit with both her and my schedules - one the weekend before Christmas, and another after Christmas but I could stay for New Years. Her response was \"don't bother coming\". We had an argument about it, and she admitted that it was a petty response because she wanted me to visit earlier. Why didn't she just say that? No idea, but she apparently considered the fight my fault because I didn't defuse her childish outburst properly. Two weeks ago, after we'd been talking and happy, she told me how much she wished I was there to help her decorate her apartment with Christmas stuff. I took this as a chance, once again, to ask about coming to see her. She said she'd love me to, and that she wanted to try and have me there ASAP. I told her we could watch a movie on Skype that night and then talk about it after. When we did eventually talk about it (after she reminded me and asked to) I offered to come down any week/weekend she wanted, and gave her two specific sets of dates that may work best, as we're both traveling for multiple times this month. Once again, she says \"I don't think there's a good time\". Less than four hours after telling me how badly she wants me there, and wants me there ASAP, she's telling me not to bother coming because there's no good time.\n\nAfter how she treated me the first time, I went into this conversation with a promise to myself - that if she turned me down again I would have to stop trying so hard to be with her since she can't make it clear she wants to be with me. After she turned down my second attempt to visit, I told her this. I said \"I can't make so much effort if you're just going to reject me every time I try, you need to make an effort\". She started crying and said she had to go, so I hung up and I gave her a week to reach out to me, to show me she cared at all. She never did. After the week was up I reached out and told her I was blocking her everywhere, because she'd gotten mad at me before for blocking her without letting her know. I did, however, still leave Skype unblocked hoping that just maybe she'd try and reach out, but she didn't. I got in my head again during this time that there was someone else, I had the same feeling from before when she was hanging out with the other guy the first time. It was my only explanation for why she would be so hot and cold, and tell me not to come see her. This past Friday, I saw she added a guy on Facebook and I just knew. I reached out to her and asked her who he was. At first she played dumb, and said \"Who?\" as if she didn't just add him that day. Then she told me he was just a friend. Eventually, it came out that he was a guy she'd gone on a date with Monday night, the night after rejecting me. She's also gone on other dates with other guys since then as well. So she can't plan for me to come visit her when she says she loves me, but she'll make a date with random guys from Tinder to get drinks with less than a couple hour's notice?\n\n--\n\nNow here I am, with her blocked on every platform, but feeling like absolute shit. How do I mean so little that she can go out on dates, and spend time with them, and kiss them, so quickly after things end? I tried dating a month after we broke up the first time, but I couldn't do it at all. The one time I did start liking a girl was before I went to see her for the interview, and after seeing her again and us talking about trying again, I cut it off. She actually got jealous and upset at me for getting a text from the girl while we were together. That's twice now that she's just discarded me and replaced me instantly with other guys. The worst part is, I have a new job that's in a field that I love and have been so excited for, but now I'm dreading it because I'll be moving to her city. I'm uprooting my life and I'm just going to be living in a place that constantly makes me think of her and how I was supposed to be here with her. Just a few weeks ago I was looking forward to getting to see her almost every day, and hold her at night, and go out on fun dates and see the city together. Now I just don't have any feelings at all. I drag about the day and just barely get my work done, and honestly hate what I had to look forward to.\n\n--\n\nThroughout this whole relationship I've been made to feel like I'm the only problem, with few exceptions. She admitted her fault in the beginning about the letter and the guy, and I fully admit my fault for not handling the situation well; the yelling, the name calling, the fights.\n\nSince then, however, it's usually been my fault. She doesn't miss a chance to call me abusive, and try and find a way to make me apologize. She never misses a chance to remind me of when I've fucked up, even if it has minimal relevance to a situation or happened a long time in the past. I feel she constantly wanted to beat me down into submission. Every time I would apologize, and say \"I know\", and try and remind her of how much I've been trying with therapy, and controlling my temper, and improving myself. Meanwhile, she hangs on to her same behaviors, and doesn't see them as a problem/something that needs to change.\n\nShe has an inability to admit fault. A few months ago she came out and told me she'd thought about going on dating apps. After pressing, it turns out she'd actually gone on dating apps, and swiped and matched with people. First of all, I believe going on dating apps while we're trying to make it work is completely unjustified in any situation. I also pointed out how she'd lied to me, by saying she was \"thinking about it\" when she'd actually already been matching people. She tried to argue that what she'd done was still \"thinking about it\" because she hadn't gone on a date. It took us making an anonymous post explaining the situation and asking opinions for her to realizing it was lying, and apologize. But she still came back and said \"I don't agree with what those people said\" and later acted as if she didn't do anything wrong.\n\nShe'll sometimes apologize and agree that something needs to change, but takes it back later. When we were trying to work it out, she refused to stop talking to the guy she cheated on me with, because he was a \"friend\". We had a phone conversation where she told me how platonic the friendship was because they could talk about people they were dating. It came up that he didn't know we were talking about trying to make it work, and I asked why he didn't, since they were so comfortable talking about it and there weren't any feelings there. She told me she didn't want to tell him because it would make him uncomfortable and he probably wouldn't talk to her anymore. I pointed out how hypocritical it is that she's worried more about his feelings than mine, and she agreed and said she'd stop talking to him if we were trying to make it work. Later, she took it back and said that me not wanting her to talk with him was controlling behavior.\n\nShe has very little appreciation for the things I do for her. She tells me I don't put her feelings first, and that I don't care about her emotions. She says I don't comfort her when she's sad. She says I always make it about me. She says this ignoring the fact that for the past two months I've been spending every day trying to create conversation. I've spent months comforting her about her insecurities - that she doesn't feel close to her family, that she's worried her friends don't want to hang out with her, that she's not doing enough at work; every time she'd come to me something I'd try and talk her into feeling better about it. So many times I would feel bad, and then she would turn it into her being upset, sometimes when I didn't even bring anything up to her. One night she told me about a new run club she had joined, and how it was just her and a bunch of guys. I know how a \"boy's club\" is when a new, attractive girl joins up, and I got a little anxious about it. I didn't express this to her, I didn't get upset, I didn't tell her I didn't want her doing it; I had been working hard on my insecurities and instead of letting it bother me I focused on other things and reduced my texting (to her normal level) . She asked me about this later and I was honest that I was anxious so I was focusing on other things. That turned into her getting mad at me for my feelings, even when I didn't take them out on her in any way. She also decided to add it to her running tally of times I'd started fights that she kept, even though she pulled it out of me. I had to apologize to her that night for feeling bad and handling it in a healthier way than I would have previously.\n\nShe always tries to make me out to be in the wrong, even when I'm the one that had a right to be hurt. I was never allowed to have feelings about, or be hurt by her actions. Even before I blocked her, when I told her she needed to show me she wanted to be with me, she took that as me abandoning her. She rejected me twice for coming to visit, and because she was upset that I would no longer make all the effort, I was the asshole for not comforting her. She even mocked me when I told her I didn't block her on Skype because I was hoping she'd reach out to me. To her it was always about winning the argument, not resolving it, and admitting fault meant she lost. She would get mad at me pointing out behaviors of hers that were hurtful, because it would \"make her feel bad about herself\". She would never appreciate things I did. I went above and beyond for her so much. She had depression and anxiety, and I would constantly be reassuring her. It was difficult during her time at the end of her PhD when she was working on her dissertation; I would try support her and comfort her when she was stressed. I didn't always handle it the best, and got frustrated with her when she would just complain at me for days, but other times I went above and beyond. She would constantly be stressed because she felt like there was too much to do, to the point that she couldn't bring herself to work at all. During the final push, I made a to-do list for her in Google Docs with all of the things that she had left to do, in small chunks just how she liked to work, so it would seem like manageable tasks rather than an overwhelming one. Each day I would update the document with what she'd done, talk her through working on it throughout the day, and even leave cute notes and citations throughout the checklist; telling her I loved her. Her response to that was \"You're my boyfriend, that's expected of you\", but she admitted that she'd done nothing like that for me. Through all this she would do nothing to support me, but would always make it seem like my actions were nothing and that I didn't care about her feelings at all. The most ironic thing about that last image was that I would ALWAYS ask what was wrong when she was acting off. She would actually get mad at me because I would ask her what was wrong so much. She would just never tell me and shut down/shut me out. No matter what I did, it would never be enough for her.\n\nI finally had enough. I deserve someone that acts like they want to be with me and appreciates me. Even now, at the end, when I finally decided to open up with how unhappy I was in the current situation; how it wasn't fulfilling for me, and that I needed more from her and this relationship - she took that as (in her words) \"my shit\" that she was done putting up with. I told her what I needed, she told me she had to go. I sent her a message after that further explaining my feelings and she saw it later that night. She didn't reach out for an entire week but she *still* told me I was the one ignoring her. She had a week to reach out and she still got mad that I didn't come crawling back in that week even when I'd specifically told her I needed her to come to me to show I mattered. All of the initiative was put on me, along with all the fault. I'm so emotionally drained.\n\n--\n\nAnyways, thanks for listening to my rant.

How do I cope?", "author": "Pvineappless", "self_text": "Its a long story but a common issue I notice with the ones who have abused me: they all deny it and make me apologize for my reactions to their abuse. Most of my reactions have been crying, but I have yelled back to them. In one case I left an abuser an abusive phone message after she had called me. \n\nOne abuser was my close friend, she often would talk ill of me, yell at me, beat me only a couple times...she masturbated around me, mislead me, and I didnt underastand she didnt want me. I loved her like a friend but she did a couple things once in awhile that made me think otherwise and I was coming off of heavy medications so I did not have nor know how to socially act around her I was, at times, awkward and she would bash on me for it. She knows I am lesbian. She made me think I could live with her. \n\nI RARELY check her social media. Last time I did it was 3 months ago, after I cried about night terrors I *still* have of her. Then 5 months prior, 7 months, very very infrequent. I am in therapy trying to heal from what she did to me. \n\nBut what made me upset was seeing her re tweet some toxic bullshit saying \"theres people who wronged me out there saying im a terrible person!!!\" ... I know she is refering to me, what SHE did to ME was terrible and... you're damn right ive been speaking to therapists and people about this! What she did to me was abuse. And she goes and denies it, sent her sociopathic friends to call it false slander, and now shes got a massive support circle of friends who have NO clue what she did to me, because I don't dare tell them. I've told enough people but the fact still stands...\n\n\nI wish she realized I tried to commit suicide because of what she did to me. She never gave me the proper closure. She never will. I am trying to live with that. I dont dare reach out because shes going to do what she did last time and make me apologize. I want her to change. I want her to feel remorse and not label me the bad one. But she won't. I've apologized for my piss poor reactions to her abuse but all in all my yelling back at her was NOTHING compared to the pshychological torture she did to me.\n\nIts not even a matter of whos right or wrong: objectivley she IS the wrong one, I apologized for the threatening voicemail I sent her after she called me weeks after she abused me the final time just to boast about sex with her boyfriend. (Who the fuck calls their ex best friend they just abused to boast about \"awesome\" sex??? Thats sociopathic.) \n\nIf you read this, and know who you are... please for the love of god. Im TIRED of these night terrors about you. I am TIRED of going to trauma therapy for the pshychological abuse you gave to me. I MISS SO BADLY THE TIMES YOU WERE SWEET TO ME. I don't want those back, but I remember them, sadly what you did to me damaged me permanently and you have no position to say I am the one in the wrong. I wish so badly you would realize you harmed me in ways that made me try to end my own life... and you fucking laughed about it. Thats fucking gross.

You don\u2019t know how much it has helped with getting this abusive asshole out of my life for good. I can\u2019t believe how similar my story is to many others here. So here goes: \n\nMy nex met me online at a time when I was very vulnerable. He started love bombing me immediately and messaged me non stop. It seemed we had everything in common and became \u201cbest friends\u201d. Within 3 months of starting to talk to him romantically he asked if he could come visit me. (He lived on the opposite side of the country). I agreed and when we met in person he gently took my face in his hands, looked into my eyes and told me he loved me. I swooned. I was such a dumbass. What a huge red flag! He didn\u2019t even know me. There were many other red flags. This was only supposed to be a visit but he ended up staying. \n\nBefore he came he was very ambiguous but at the time I just thought he wanted privacy. He told me and gave the impression he was financially stable, he had a good resume. I even did a background check on him. He was in the service and a former police man and dare officer.  But after he got here information started trickling out little by little. He didn\u2019t have a car, had been living with his mother (he had flat out lied about this saying he had a roommate!), had no job and no money or credit. I know it sounds crazy but it took a while for everything to come out because he had some savings and seemed financially stable at first. \n\nLong story short he ended up moving in with me and the abuse started soon there after. The first time he verbally abused me was when I asked for some attention. He had started being cold to me after he moved in. He ended up telling me that he was tired of forcing himself to touch me because I was so fat. I am not fat. But boy did that start the mind fuck. In the last year I have been called dumb bitch, fat, disgusting, pathetic, and a whole slew of other things. Each time he would cry and apologize and I would forgive and end up apologizing myself! \n\nLuckily I have a great support system and after a year and half of this abuse (including one time when he actually got physical and choked me) I had the strength and the clarity to tell him to leave. He is back home at his mom\u2019s. And I am the happiest I\u2019ve ever been.  Whenever I\u2019m feeling a moment of weakness I get on here and read these stories or read back over his abusive texts. 2020 is our year! Stay strong everyone!", "subreddit": "NarcissisticAbuse"}

First of all, I apologize in advance if I make any mistakes and if my style of writing isn\u2019t too good, as English isn\u2019t my native tongue (I\u2019m French :^D ). I originally wanted to post this in r/LetsNotMeet , but figured the subject didn't fit that subreddit.  So yeah, gonna get this off of my chest.\n    \n    \n        This happened maybe two or three months ago, I can\u2019t remember exactly. I recently moved in my dad\u2019s apartment in Paris, after my mother\u2019s passing (peace to her soul). One day, as I was sitting on a bench and drawing in my sketchbook, a man approached me : he was a scrawny old man with almost no teeth, wearing a red raincoat. He seemed friendly enough, so we started to talk. He asks me if I have Maghrebian origins \u2013 I tell him I\u2019m half Algerian; he tells me he\u2019s Algerian too. (N.B. : there\u2019s is a high population of Algerian people in France !)\n    \n        At first, I thought he was just a sweet old man : we did some small talk and he told me how much of  a good, smart person I am and that \u201ckids like you are so rare these days\u201d.  \n    \n        A few weeks fly by, I had seen him a couple more times. A big red flag was that he was very clingy, and I just did not have a good \u201cvibe\u201d with him. One day, as I was going home from uni, he stopped me from behind. I was startled, then I recognized him, then I was like \u201coh, uh, hey\u201d. I was annoyed, but I put on my friendly mask. We talk a bit, then I tell him that I gotta go home, but he insists that we hang out. I comply, since well, if things go south, I\u2019ll just stand for myself.  \n    \n        As time goes by, I get an increasingly bad feeling about him. I tell him several times that I gotta go, but he insisted again that I \u201cstay just a little longer\u201d. I figured there\u2019s no arguing him, so I was like \u201ceh, whatever\u201d.  \n        That is were things started to get really weird. Remember when I said that he\u2019d compliment me and stuff? Well he kept doing just that, telling me how intelligent I am, how successful I would be, and how nice and polite I am. I just kept getting weird vibes from those \u2013 I kept feeling like there were innuendos, for some reason. Especially when there were slip ups where he would misgender me (another N.B.: I had told him that I\u2019m actually a guy, but hadn\u2019t went into detail about, you know, trans stuff)\n    \n        He asked me to follow him to his apartment, which I complied with \u2013 I can\u2019t remember exactly why  I did that, I just didn\u2019t want get on his wrong side, I guess (who knows, maybe if I had ran away, he would have followed me home, and I did not want that at all). On the way to his \u201chome\u201d, he would insist on holding my hand, and he even forcefully kissed me on the lips \u2013 \u201cas a joke\u201d, he said, but I didn\u2019t believe him. When we had arrived to his building, we entered the elevator. Instead of going to his supposed \u201capartment\u201d, he tried to get me to the building\u2019s basement. Upon arriving on that floor, the lights were all out, and he kissed me again. This is where I had enough. I told him I am out of there.  \n    \n        After that, he sat on a bench, and I told him that whatever his true intentions are, I just find him really creepy. His response? \u201cI\u2019d never do that to people, if I wanna get off, I just do *that*\u201d accompanied by a masturbation gesture.

We met online, went on a date, and hit it off right away. He was charming, confident, and made me feel special and like I was the the best thing to have ever entered his life. On our first date we both made it clear we were looking for a long term relationship. We quickly began dating and learning more about each other\u2019s lives and meeting each other\u2019s friends. I fell hard for him and he fell hard for me. He was always complimenting me. Throughout our relationship though there were issues that bothered me and I felt like I had to walk on eggshells to bring them up or he would quickly go on the defensive. Things like him not responding to me over text for hours on end, or me feeling like he was keeping me at arms length, or everything always being done on his terms. I know he put in an effort to get better in some aspects, but didn\u2019t in others. What bugged me most was that he would point out other people he found attractive, or commenting on other\u2019s bodies or appearances and how \u201chot\u201d they were in front of me. I didn\u2019t understand why he did this, other than to make me feel inadequate or not enough for him or that I was easily replaceable. He dismissed my concerns and said he was just the type of guy that appreciates beauty. Ok, I thought, I can get over that, he\u2019s loyal to me\u2026\n\nOften times when I\u2019d bring up things that were irritating me or things that were on my mind and feelings, I would often have them dismissed and then I\u2019d end up being the one apologizing.

I was just trying to communicate my needs in a relationship to him\u2014respect and loyalty and kindness. \n\nOther times he\u2019d tell me I\u2019m being inconsistent or unclear about what I want. This was especially relevant when he\u2019d talk so openly and freely about random hook up and flings and people he\u2019s hooked up with in the past. I told him that made me uncomfortable and that he\u2019d stop doing that and bringing it up. However, when I found out his ex, whom he had dated for 5 years had contacted him, and I asked him about it, he told me he didn\u2019t tell me because he wasn\u2019t sure how I\u2019d react and I\u2019d be angry and jealous and break up with him. But in my mind, an ex of 5 years vs. a random fling is different\u2014I think that definitely should be brought up and disclosed to a person\u2019s significant other, but maybe I\u2019m just crazy. \n\nOn the flip side, there were times when he\u2019d be ok to talk to me about how I was feeling, but he still seemed guarded and didn\u2019t want to share too much of his own feelings beyond that he loves me. Getting to know his feelings was a struggle\u2014I think he struggled a lot with his own insecurities, maybe internalized homophobia (that\u2019s a shot in the dark, I\u2019m no psychologist), that he couldn\u2019t verbalize or express, which was confusing because he always carried himself with confidence and charm. A lot of times I felt like I was always the one to initiate any intimate moments between us\u2014I didn\u2019t feel wanted physically a lot of times, which sucked and made me feel worthless and contributed more to the feeling of inadequacy. Getting to know his feelings was a struggle\u2014I never really knew the reason why he said he loved me other than that I brought positivity into his life (ice cream brings positivity into life too, but that doesn\u2019t mean you fall in love with it!) I felt like I was just a convenient person by his side to ensure he wasn\u2019t lonely and feed his ego (I was always complimenting his looks, his success). I went out of my way to do things for him, plan dates, but he never did that for me. I felt like I was pouring so much love into him but it wasn\u2019t being reciprocated. \n\nThings ended in November when we were both out drinking with friends when I saw a dating/hookup app on his phone. Yes I was drunk but I know I saw it there. I left the bar and he started gaslighting me\u2014telling me I\u2019m seeing things, I\u2019m crazy, that I\u2019m insecure, that I need to \u201cget over my bullshit insecurities\u201d. I regret the way I ended things ended after that. I didn\u2019t give him any chance really to explain himself or to talk, I just ended it and iced him out. I\u2019m the type of person that values respect above all else, and I definitely didn\u2019t live up to my own standards then. At the same time though, I wasn\u2019t always shown respect in the words he said to me (he once told me to fuck off one time during an argument\u2014I\u2019m sensitive maybe but that is not a way anyone that is in love with another person speaks to them). I was so hurt and wounded, I couldn\u2019t handle getting more hurt. I definitely could have handled that breakup a lot more maturely. \n\nIn the time since we broke up, we met in person to talk and I expressed a lot of what I was feeling to him. I wrote him a long letter with a lot of my feelings and how I felt\u2014he took it as an attack on him and how shitty a person he is. That was never my intention, more to just make him aware of my feelings and sadness and hurt, but he couldn\u2019t understand that. I recognized that I had hurt him and wounded him, but he didn\u2019t recognize that he hurt me. He also declared his creed of living life \u201cunapologetically\u201d. That\u2019s fine with me, you can do what you do, but I asked him at what point does he live unapologetically and forget the feelings of those that love him? \n\nMost recently I received a text from him saying he loves me and listed things he\u2019s never told me about, like how he liked to watch me peacefully sleep, or how he loved thinking of me smiling at him, or how he would always crave spending time with. I responded back with a heartfelt response saying that I definitely still loved him too but there has been so much hurt going BOTH ways between us. I told him that there needs to be change. I told him there needs to be growth. He read the message and never responded. \n\nI know that there\u2019s a lot I need to work on\u2014I hold people to a really high standard and expect perfection from others and myself which is unrealistic. But I\u2019ve also learned that what I want in a relationship is sensible and rational and I\u2019m definitely a person that deserves a relationship with love and respect.\n\nI\u2019m just so hurt and confused and want to hear thoughts and opinions. Was I dating a narc, or just an immature person? Both? I wish he could change and I know I can\u2019t change him. I have so many emotions and thoughts going through my mind and its hard to keep them all straight and organized and make sense of anything that\u2019s happened. \n\n I love him and was always telling him reasons why I love him. It hurts so much that we\u2019re in this place now. \n\nI believe him when he said he loved me but did he love me for me or for just being a body by his side?

Not sure how much help I can get with this other than putting this out there.\n\nI'm not sure where my dad falls on the scale, but he's definitely a guilt tripper and has some other worrisome traits. My whole life he's been one to critique, but never to praise. I was actually afraid of him for a long time as a child, as he was prone to get mad and grumpy for simple mistakes and nothing seemed to be good enough, whether it was homework or chores I did. I learned early on that he only speaks with earnest emotion when intoxicated, and then has no filter. After a lifetime of alcohol abuse and smoking, his body is no longer cooperating and he's not in a good place any more, physically or mentally.\n\nMy mom divorced him some five years ago now, as well as my sister refusing to interact with him any more, leaving me as the last contact he has. He lets me know quite often how lonely he is, but refuses to change his ways - plenty of people offer to help, but it has to be on his terms, never theirs. Christmas is coming up and he's so sad that \"no one\" wants to be with him. Except that at least two other family members offered to celebrate with him at their place, even offering to pick him up. Oh no, he couldn't do that. His health is so bad he can't be social, he claims. Yet, somehow that doesn't exclude me from coming? Oh woe is me, he cries.\n\nI live about four hours away and work full time, so it's rare I get to visit. And to be frank, I don't even want to most of the time. We have almost nothing in common, and he doesn't speak much at all (unless he drinks, then the words spew forth, but it's mostly about how people are so unfair to him and how bad his life is now). He never calls, and if he does calm it's because he's drunk and wants to complain about something like my sister ruining his life.\n\nI'm sorry dad, but you brought this on yourself. You have chosen to distance yourself both directly and indirectly. I feel bad for him, sure, but it's hard to feel much sympathy for a person that doesn't seem to want to improve either. I don't know what to do about him any more. Or if anything can be done. I don't have the heart to completely cut him out of my life.", "subreddit": "emotionalabuse"}

I always believed that he couldn't control his impulses, but the kind of manipulation and pain he's put me under, that requires control. \n\nHe chose to hurt me, he enjoyed it, he still had me there for him and yet he found an excuse to hurt me even more, to push me away while making sure I stayed hooked onto him. \n\nToday I tried once again to make things right. I don't know if it was the right thing to do, I keep thinking that every time I express my feelings, it means losing the possibility of him learning to love me on his own.

But everything goes to the same point: for me to have his \"love\", I need to be submissive. \n\nI told him that I didn't believe he ever loved me. That he only faked love when I gave him something good; that's why everytime he dared tell me he loved me (I could count them with one hand), it was followed by \"you bring me more good than bad\". It was always about what I gave, not because of who I am. No wonder why I spent these years blaming myself for feeling useless. I wish I hadn't learn to live through sacrifices.\n\nHe agreed with me. He's cruel enough to agree and smart enough to do it in such a way that he will be able to dismiss it if I dare to mention that to him.

A couple of days later, my friend told me he was asking people, who I was.\n\nA week later we went on a date, and we immediately connected. I felt like I could be myself 100%, and that he adored me for it. Right after the date ended, like 10 minutes after I was dropped off at my place, he texted \u201cI wanna see you again ASAP.\u201d And I felt so lucky that he felt that way about me.\n\nWe spend 7 days and nights in a row together after that. He would tell me how beautiful I looked, point out little things that he liked about me, how special I was, and how he hadn\u2019t felt like this or been interested in any girl this was since his only and first love, who he had broken up with a couple of years earlier. I felt so special. Right after I left his place, he would text me how much I ment and that I deserved the best in the world. I felt sooo lucky.\n\nThen, 1 month into it, we went out together one night and had the beeest time, where we really got close to each other. We went home that same day, and met up later in the evening - and by that time he had changed 180. He asked me, if we could slow things down, cause he wasn\u2019t really sure about what he was looking for, so he wanted to do casual dating. \n\nI was SO confused. I thought we were casually getting to know each other, but that everythin was just naturL and easy. Anyways, I agreed to do that, but his behavior changed so much after that.\n\nI would no longer get the sweet texts all the time, he would say that I was needy for wanting so spend time together, he no longer prioritized me when I asked him to go out, but whenever he wanted to, I would find time because he was a priority in my life. \n\nIt was hard. He made me feel like I was the most annoying person in the world. One day I confronted him and told him how I felt. I said \u201cYou put me on this pedastal the first month or two, and suddenly you just tore it down\u201d. He said \u201cNo I didn\u2019t\u201d, and when I mentioned all the things he had said to me in the beginning and what he had written, he said \u201cThat really doesn\u2019t sound like me, I don\u2019t think, I\u2019ve done that.\u201d Like, completely like he didn\u2019t know what I was talking about. But EVEN AFTER THAT CONVO he told me, that he wanted to see where this could go and that he just wanted me to be honest with him.\n\nI tried and tried, but in the end it was too hard. I broke it off, and he took it like I meant nothing to him. Then a couple of days later, he invites me to a gathering with our friends. (WTF??) I showed up.\n\nWhen I showed up, I just ignored him and had a great time with everyone else. But by the end of the night, we got into an argument. I told him, that I wanted him to know, that I didn\u2019t end it with him because I stopped having feelings for him, but because I felt I gave more than what I got back from him. I wanted to let him know, that I cared for him. But in that moment, he replied \u201cYou will never be good enough to be with me, because you can\u2019t be honest with me.\u201d It hit me so hard.\n\nAnyways... it\u2019s been 7-8 months still, and I feel like even though I ended it, it\u2019s still affecting me. No one is interesting to me, and I don\u2019t even wanna date anyone. I\u2019m exhausted after this. He could never apologize - cause he never thought he owed me any. Or any explenation. Oe anything at all.\n\nI recently saw him after 8 months. And I ended up with him. I don\u2019t feel like it hurt me, because I see who he is now. But I still get disappointed in him because of how he is - does that make sense? Like, I\u2019m annoyed that he couldn\u2019t just be the \u201cgreat part\u201d that I see of him, all the time.\n\nDoes anyone else feel this way? Is it normal to be THIS affected after that long?

Until Thanksgiving (not sure what he\u2019s done since) he was drinking a lot and doing a lot of cocaine and his sickness had been coming on for months.\n\nEarly into this separation he was very apologetic and said he knew that he needed to make some changes because the path he is on will either lead him to trouble or death.

{"post_id": "ecmafw", "created_utc": 1576720519, "title": "Just Want To Share My story", "author": "jaram22m", "self_text": "I'm 23 years old. I'm a first-generation senior college student at a prestigious women's college. I have always been confident, I'm the oldest child and I come from a family that loves me a lot and has always believed in me. I grew up very poor and college was always a distant, intangible dream. When I arrived as a first year, I was very overwhelmed, it was the first time I was away from my family. I had never been in a relationship or even really on a date before college because I was just always focused on school. First semester I met the person who would eventually become my first partner. At the time they were still with their girlfriend from high school and were carrying on a long-distance relationship. I never saw them as a potential love interest because I knew they weren't single, plus I didn't even know I was gay. We became best friends and did everything together, we were in the same friend group but they were often initiating one-on-one hangouts. We started having sleepovers after we'd come from a long night of partying and wouldn't want to walk all the way home in the snow and cold (my dormroom was next to the bus stop). One night after heavy drinking and partying, they were feeling really upset and opened up about all the emotional abuse they'd endured from their mom growing up and how suicide was a constant thought for them. I felt terrible for them and hugged them as I drunkenly fell asleep. The next thing I remember is waking up with their fingers inside me, they had a ton of rings on and I was in pain and bleeding. The next morning they told me they were in love with me and thought of me as their soulmate. I truly had never thought of them that way but I felt confused and enjoyed how intensely they seemed to love me, I was 20 at the time and had never been with anyone so I wanted to believe this was a good thing. They wanted to continue hooking up without telling their ex and I told them I couldn't support that (my dad cheated a ton on my mom and I felt so guilty I had participated in doing that to another person). They eventually ended things with their ex and we moved too fast. We became roommates and started living together. My friends at the time were shocked and told me that this all seemed very weird, that they felt like this person was treating me as their personal emotional support pet. I was really insulted by this and stopped being their friend and focused 100% of my energy on my partner. They were constantly anxious and I rejoiced in being able to cater to their every need. I went from being the chair of multiple clubs, a member of student government, from having a ton of friends, to someone who lived for their partner. Things made a turn for the worse whenever their mom would visit or we'd go visit her. Our school is a 90 minute drive to their home, while my house is over 1,200 miles away. I truly believe their mom is incapable of feeling love, she's an alcoholic and would often be passed out on the floor drooling. She had my former partner when she was a teenager and I think she blames my former partner for ruining her potential career. I tried so hard to be liked, I'm latina and their white and they were always making slightly racist comments as jokes and I would laugh with them. My former partner would complain to me all the time about their mom and how they hated her and how she was awful and I believed them. I began to blame and hate their mom for how terrible she made my partner feel. After 3 years of being together, their family had never invited me to a family vacation, while my mom had overcome her homophobia (we are a very devout catholic family while my partner is not religious at all) and welcomed my partner into our home and vacations. I finally put my foot down and said I was gonna go to their annual trip to the Cape. Their mom was really hesitant but eventually \"caved in\". When we got to the cabin at the Cape there was a ton of constant tension. The mom was constantly drunk (and hiding it, my former partner and her played this game where she would get drunk, hide the bottles, my former partner would find them and put them on display on the counter to shame her). I am an easy going person, I'm not awkard and very good at keeping a light conversation (I am a trained campus tourguide after all). I would take all the insults she threw at me and laugh them off but when I brought them up to my partner they would tell me I was making it up. My former partner is trans and at the time had recently started taking hormones to transition into a more masculine person. This is a lot to take in for a parent and this vacation was not the time for this but she found out. One morning my former partner and I went to walk on the beach and when we got back to the cabin, their mom was hurt that my former partner had chosen to go on a walk with me instead of her. She started to cry and I said I could leave to do some groceries. I said I would go alone but my former partner decided to come with me. When we got back there was no one at the cabin and I told them to go find their mom and brother at the beach and try to smooth things over while I made pina coladas for everyone. As I was making the drinks I began to hear terrible screams and realized they were insults about me. She called me a \"fucking psycho\" for coming on the vacation and after an hour of yelling they returned. When she got back, I was tanning in my bathing suit and she said I was \"the cutest thing she'd ever seen\" ( this was a very twilight zone moment for me after hearing her spew so much hate). I handed her the pina colada and smiled and tried to pretend this was normal but I could still feel the tension. I was brought up around very open lines of communication and calmly asked if we could clear the air and apologized for making her uncomfortable but tried to point out that I really really wanted to feel accepted into this family. At this point she lost it, started to yell at me, called me a spic, kicked me out, said I was attacking her and needed to understand her culture. I felt so humiliated, my former partner didn't say a word to stand up to me and I just left. I got a hotel in town (I already had the week off from work and I didn't want to drive 5 hours back by myself so I decided to wait till their vacation was over, have my own solo trip and try to move on). I was very disappointed by this rejection but understood that my former partner was terrified of their mom and would never say anything to contradict her. I started to feel really scared when my former partner stopped responding to messages and eventually said \"you need to get over this, we have, we're not even talking about you anymore\". I got this message while I was out at a bar and some guy had just asked me if I was a prostitute and I was just feeling so alone and unsupported, I ran out of the bar and saw my former partner with their family getting ice cream (we were in a very small town). I wanted to run to my former partner and just hug them, I missed them so much, I was in a very different surrounding to what I'm used to (I'm from Miami).\n\nWhen the trip ended, we were planning on driving back together. After being kicked out and experiencing such cold and shunned reactions from my former partner, I did some questionable irrational things. I showed up at their cabin one night at 2 am, after not hearing a word from my former partner (we were together for three years and lived together! so this sudden distance was hard to cope with) and begged them (through text) to come out and speak with me, their mom was drunkenly passed out so she didn't have to know. Then, the night before my former partner and I were supposed to head back home, I got a call from my former partner saying that their mom was under the impression I had already gone back and said I was \"psychotic\" for staying and thinking I could drive back with my partner. When I heard this I couldn't keep quiet any more and sent her a text message calling her a toxic and controlling narcissist ( which is something my therapist had described some of her past behavior), I also sent her a link to a youtube video that describes narcissist parents and it described her to a tee. After I sent that message, my former partner told me that my behavior was unacceptable, that I was a danger to myself and to them and there was no way they were coming home with me, they needed \"time to think\".\n\nI was very hurt and confused and they were ignoring all my messages and calls after they said that. I drove the 5 hours back home and made a meal with our roommate and drank myself to sleep. The next morning I wake up to them showing up with the police and starting to pack their bags. All they said was \"our relationship has been bad for a while and all our friends agree\". I started to sob and their mom began to videotape me and laugh at my face. They said I had a history of being violent and thats why they had to bring the police (i swear I have Never gotten violent, that is just not even something that crosses my mind).\n\nThey leave, completely ghost me and I'm devasted. I'm crying on the phone to my mom and she buys me the first ticket available to Miami. I quit my job over the phone and go back to miami. There's a month left before school starts again and I spend it all drinking and crying in bed. I stop eating and lose 25 pounds. Then I receive a call from our shared storage unit saying that my former partner is threatening to sue me claiming that I have stolen their stuff and I'm keeping it hostage. I'm so confused because I'm not even in the state, I was never allowed to keep the keys to anything because my former partner always framed me as being ditzy and irresponsible and I specifically remember them keeping the keys and because they were afraid I would lose them. A week before school starts, I get an email from the administration informing me that my former partner has taken out a restraining order against me. I finally reach out to my friends, because after being discarded like that I was a shell of a person, I couldn't get out of bed or talk to anyone. They tell me that Im a crazy abusive person and that I should never talk to them again. I beg them to tell me what it is they think I did and they just ghost me as well.\n\nWhen school finally starts, I am terrified to leave my room for fear of running into them. I feel like everyone believes them and hates me and  I feel like a pariah on our tiny campus in the middle of nowhere. I've been going to therapy since I was a teenager for an eating disorder so I still have my weekly sessions with my therapist but that is about the only contact with another human I have. There is only one large cafeteria at my school so I avoid it, keep losing weight, since everyone is busy and as seniors everyone already has their social circles in place, the only place to bond with people outside of class is really the cafeteria and since I can't stomach the thought of entering that place, I continue to isolate myself.  Not only that, but because of the restraining order, I can't be in any room or space where my former partner is there first. We are a very small campus and basically, wherever they are, I will end up running into them so I just avoid leaving my room altogether.  My therapists refers me to a psychiatrist and I begin taking antidepressants. I'm doing a lot better now,  the semester is over and I'm home for the holidays. I have slowly began to make new friendships by practicing daily positive affirmations, meditation and anxiety medication. I now have constant psoriaris flare ups. The most recent things they're doing to hurt me are: they cut some cables from my car's engine and destroyed it, stole my car keys, spread a rumor that I was distributing a sex tape from a student that graduated two years ago (the story is I lent her my camera for a project, she shot some nude scenes for her movie, never told me or deleted them and one day I found them on my sd card and shocked mentioned it to my partner but i never saw it myself, just saw a image clip on the file and certainly didn't show it to anyone else and then I deleted it. I went to a party with my new friends, I knew my former partner and former friends would be there but I ignored them and danced the night away with joy and feeling love from my new friends. Then I woke up to an email from the school administration asking me to go to a meeting with a dean to discuss a potential break in the restraining order. After hearing my side of the story, they agreed that I didn't break any rules since I stayed in a different side of the room (I personally never even saw them at the party or think about them). It's hard to move on because I feel like whenever something positive happens or I'm feeling comfortable in my new life, they do something to break me down. It breaks my heart because I still love this person and their vindictive behavior is unfounded since the only thing I'm guilty of is finally standing up for myself after three years of verbal abuse from them and their mom and constant gaslighting. Now I'm going back to so many moments in our relationship and recognizing ways I made myself smaller for them. Dropped my own social circle, when my grandmother died I was crying at night (she dies at 3am) and my former partner yelled at me saying that I always planned my tears to align with the night before they have an exam because I wanted them to fail by not getting enough sleep, I couldn't sneeze in our room because \"loud noises trigger their anxiety\", I apologized for every single fight because they never would and it was easier for me to end the fight because I treasured their happiness and it genuinely broke my heart to ever see them upset.\n\nWow this is longer than I meant for it to be. If you've read this far, thank you! Also tell me your story or tell me about you and how you're coping! Because this is so! hard!", "subreddit": "NarcissisticAbuse"}

I remember when he first told me they were together I started crying for hours on the phone and of course he didnt care. He just added some more salt on the wound by bringing it up and calling her my girl in front of me with no concern for my feelings. The reason I talked to him for some long is because when I talked to other people about it honestly they took his side, so I thought I was the one overreacting. \n\n\nI cut contact with him a few days ago and basically told him I was tired of the games and the whole \"friendship\" between them is weird and that I'm cutting him off permanently. I think he's going to put her through the same thing I went through after a while, but I don't know.I don't want to be associated with it anymore. He didnt even care. He never cared about me being out of his life. He seems to care so much about her and I dont understand what I did to be valued so little and her so highly. I don't get it and no I don't feel bad for the new supply. She's not some innocent little angel that doesn't know what's going on. She knows what she's about and doesnt care. She talks about the girls he messes with. I feel like she likes the attention he gives her and doesn't care how he treats other women. \n\nThe whole situation was weird, but I guess I should be happy I'm out of it, but I'm not.", "subreddit": "NarcissisticAbuse"}

That no matter how we responded, the same thing would have happened and we'd be discarded anyway. Is that true for all cases?\n\nFor backstory I(22F) gave my ex (23M) the benefit of the doubt multiple times because it was his first relationship and mine too. Since being \"discarded\" 8 months ago I feel like I have awoken out of a coma and have now realized I was emotionally abused as a child, before even meeting him. I hate that I wonder whether he is partially right because he is/was so adamant about how negative and controlling I was - so adamant that he even blocked me. Because my mother, who is just like my ex, has now decreased her gaslighting/manipulation and in my eyes respects me more, I wonder if my inability to clearly state my abuse was the reason I was \"discarded\". I wonder if I inadvertently was passive aggressive and controlling?\n\nIn sum, my ex was touchy from the start and one day he went way too far. When it happened I was scared and froze. I was really quiet as I tried to remove myself from his grasp. I eventually moved but when I tried to bring it up later he'd deflect with jokes/ excuses and one time he told me it was because I didn't say no. I should have left then but I didn't. I suppose I was used to people not listening to me and I also blamed myself because I should have seen it coming. Because I didn't leave and explicitly say that I would not tolerate it, he kept doing things and would pretend to not know why I was upset. So that's how our \"relationship\" progressed. He'd push a boundary, I'd get silent because I was honestly scared sometimes, and he would make up an excuse. I always knew he was lying and in many ways I tried to get him to be accountable. But on the same note I believed what he told me and empathized with all his stories of bullies and parental abuse that always seemed to be apart of the conversation whenever I wanted to talk about how I was hurt by his actions.\n\nIn other instances I'd say no to his requests and he'd keep asking or he would say something rude or do something rude and I'd get reasonably hurt. As far as the sexual stuff I try not to be hypocritical because sometimes I wanted to be intimate, but I always felt like he would take advantage of the situation. Not often did he acknowledge his actions, but when he did he said \"I kinda feel bad for pressuring you\" or \"I feel like I've corrupted you\". Because he didn't listen to me or take me seriously early on, I got in the habit of bringing up issues later when I had more courage. He'd cancel dates, not talk to me for three days, or just be distant whenever I wanted to talk about things and he'd act seriously upset like I was manipulating him. However, twice I tried to break it off and he would again act so distraught and tell me I had it all wrong etc, so I'd believe him. He'd temporarily agree to treat me the way I asked but would also act like I had forced him into doing something he didn't want to do. That is where I am confused because I'd say we need to talk and I saw an article that said that phrase puts people on edge. And was me trying to leave seen as an ultimatum? I never said, if you don't do x,y, and z I will leave, but I did suggest that maybe we shouldn't be dating because from what I've observed you do not care because x,y, or z.\n\nIs that passive aggressive and do you think he was as oblivious to my feelings as he said he was? Is that negative and \"controlling\"? Although he \"discarded\" 6 weeks after having sex for the first time, I wonder if that was the problem.", "subreddit": "NarcissisticAbuse"}

My brother and sister in law, who I havent seen in three years,  are coming down in a couple days for christmas break.  While I'm excited I'm also kind of nervouse because they are the only people in my life that still have contact with my Nex. My mother cut off contact about nine months ago when I finally broke down and told her the truth about how he had treated me and that knowing she was talking to him hurt me. (He uses people in my life to try to get in contact with me or to try to turn them against me depending on his mood). I never really explained to my brother what all happened or that my ex is a narcissist, just said he didnt treat me well and I'd prefer my ex not have contact with my family. My Nex has a child I raised from a baby until 5 basically, that he doesnt let me have any contact with. He let's my brother have contact tho so I  dont feel right laying it out because then my brother could lose contact with the child he sees as his niece and I dont want that to happen. I still feel awkward about it though because I dont really want my brother bringing him up and things between us have been strained since I ended the relationship. My brother moved out of state before I ended the relationship so he wasnt here for the massive disaster that was the break up. So he didnt get to see my Nexs true colors the way some people did. I think hes kind of still under the \"nice misunderstood guy\" spell my Nex likes to put on people. My \"new\" boyfriend (weve been officially together for a year but basically have been together for two) will be at christmas morning this year (like last year) and this will be the first time they meet. I'm excited for my brother to meet my bf, I think theyll really get along and my bf is a truely amazing and kind man. I'm so nervouse that my brother will bring my Nex and make things uncomfortable, especially in front of my bf.  Im also scared that things will be strained between my brother and I in person because he doesnt see my Nex for who he is and I know my Nex has spent the last two years filling his head with excuses and talking bad about me. (He openly refers to me as the devil) Plus honestly holidays are still hard for me because I did raise my Nexs little girl as my own daughter. it still hurts alot to remember past holidays with her and know I'll never have contact with her again. My Nex wont allow it because it would directly expose his lies about our breakup if he did and make him look bad. Thankfully at this point I think his parents are raising her more than my Nex is so at least I know shes actually being taken care of. \nSo if you have any advise on how to cope with seeing family who still has contact with your Nex for the first time in person since the break up I would be super grateful. Or advise on how to deal with holidays missing a child that you'll never see again... honestly I would really appreciate that alot too.", "subreddit": "NarcissisticAbuse"}

How people won\u2019t make an effort anymore, and how people flee at the smallest hint of trouble, or at the smallest indication that they\u2019d have to accommodate and make changes to their activities or behavior to make room for the person they\u2019re with. They criticize those who walk away as cowards, saying they gave up.\n\nMy ex used to swear by this philosophy. The relationship turned abusive, I became reactionary, in the sense that I defaulted to anger and defensiveness when the accusations and suspicions arose. She made me feel like I never did enough, that I didn\u2019t make her feel loved. She would say that her friends and family could do what I did for her, so what was I bringing to the table? She was convinced that I would cheat on her, that I was interested in other people. But she never broke up with me. She said that not sticking by each other and breaking up would be giving up, that only cowards did that. That people gave up on each other very easily, and that it was a very common thing for people nowadays and it was wrong wrong wrong; but not us, we were going to be different. She was unhappy by my side but she never left. I felt like I was the worst, but she wanted me even if I was the worst? It made me feel like I owed her the effort of taking her abuse and holding out for things to get better. After all, those in love should never give up on each other, because love conquers all, and we loved each other very much, right?\n\nBut they never did get better. We were almost five years together. I left after the feeling of worthlessness and inadequacy became too much, and at that point I resented her more than I loved her. I guess she thinks I was a coward for opting out, and that I gave up, and that still messes with my mind a lot. I feel remorse when I think about it, remembering how gung-ho she was about \u201cnot giving up\u201d. But almost six months have gone by and I\u2019m the happiest I\u2019ve been in years. I can feel my self confidence coming back to me little by little. \n\nI guess it\u2019s all about striking a balance in how we approach making an effort in a relationship, but within reasonable limits. I get where these claims about this thing I\u2019ve come to call in my mind \u201cdisposable culture\u201d come from, and I do think it\u2019s a problem when people just ghost after a few days of talking, or take minor disagreements that can be traced to miscommunication or mismatched expectations as gigantic red flags that warrant breaking up. They\u2019re a problem that I think is valid and warrants addressing. But I wish I saw more of this other side in the conversation about \u201cdisposable culture\u201d about the times when it\u2019s necessary to give up on someone and walk away. I\u2019m used to seeing an overwhelming majority of people condemn those who leave, and I think it generated doubts that even now I\u2019m having trouble shaking off, and made it so I waited far longer than I should have to leave.\n\nI\u2019d love to hear any thoughts and experiences you\u2019d like to share about this. \ud83d\ude0a Cheers\\~", "subreddit": "abuse"}

Over the course of the last year I managed to escape my abuser. What happened a year ago has caused dissociative episodes. Today I\u2019m fighting off the same emotions I went through last year.\n\nI was already suicidally depressed. I had been in therapy for 9 months and was getting better. I hadn\u2019t felt suicidal for 3 weeks before this happened. The thing that very few people I have told don\u2019t understand is that he used everything I told him in confidence against me. I didn\u2019t want to die. I didn\u2019t necessarily want to live, which may sounds like the same thing but it isn\u2019t. \n\nI knew he was going to gaslight me into fighting with him since he had a work party he was attending the next day. I set boundaries as I was supposed to. My biggest one was not to give him ammo he could use later. When I wouldn\u2019t break my boundaries he called me weak, pathetic, worthless, useless, not the person I used to be, too crazy for therapy, unlovable, disgusting, perpetual victim. He repeated himself over and over. I begged him on my knees to please just stop. Stop talking. He wouldn\u2019t. I said he was pushing me closer to the edge and I didn\u2019t want to harm myself. So he continued. He followed me room to room repeating himself as I tried escaping him...So I attempted to kill myself with a knife that was too dull. When I went to get another knife he asked me if I wanted him to call the police or the suicide hotline. I said yes. He didn\u2019t look away from his video game but got enraged. \nHe made it about himself when he brought up an ex who committed suicide when he broke up with her and is the last person to have spoken to her. As far as I know, every one of his exes had attempted suicide while they were with him or after they broke up. He called me selfish and then repeated the cycle of hateful things. I begged him to stop. He got more and more angry. I walked away so I could try to hurt myself again. He called me back and said, \u201cno one will blame me if you kill yourself.\u201d I hadn\u2019t even suggested or alluded to blaming him. It made me think of how from the very beginning of our relationship he would say, \u201cno one can make another person kill themselves.\u201d Bizarre. \nI ended up leaving, though he tried to stop me. Kept calling me selfish for leaving. I called the suicide hotline where the person I spoke with said I was being abused. I was shocked. I didn\u2019t see it as abusive at the time. I had nowhere to go. I tried to reach out to friends but no one could help. The part of the story I leave out, probably the most painful for me, is that I had to apologize to him so I could go back home. After like an hour and 15 minutes of apologizing he blurted \u201cI\u2019m going to kill myself now\u201d. I was like wtf are you talking about? I remember thinking I must deserve all of this.\n\nA week later I brought up the fight \u201con neutral ground\u201d as my therapist suggested. However, it ended with me in a fetal position sobbing on the ground, pleading with him to stop. While he screamed at me with a balled fist how lucky I am he isn\u2019t the kind of guy who would hit me, because I deserved it. \n\nRight now I feel empty. Vulnerable. Like I want someone to say, \u201cyes, this did happen to you. Yes, he did push you. Yes, it was purposeful to suit whatever his needs were.\u201d I still don\u2019t know why he asked me if I wanted him to call the police or the suicide hotline if he didn\u2019t intend on doing so. I wish I knew if his plan all along was to get me to commit suicide or if he got pissed that I wouldn\u2019t break my boundaries and therefore didn\u2019t care what happened to me. I guess it doesn\u2019t matter but to some degree it matters to me. \n\nAnyway, thank you to anyone who reads this.", "subreddit": "NarcissisticAbuse"}

It's a medical condition, I have other brain symptoms beyond the sleep ones. The sleep ones are important for explaining this though. A few things can trigger it, one is sounds early in the wee hours of morning that wake me up. \n\nThere's two main symptoms. #1 is sleep paralysis. Mine is worse than a lot of peoples, it usually lasts 4 hours. Thankfully I usually don't hallucinate, but I do get the terror feeling that people get when they hallucinate. Due to other brain symptoms, I also get muscle spasms that can happen in my sleep, and sometimes I'm spasming and get paralyzed that way. It feels like holding a stretch or a flex for four hours, it hurts a lot. It's bad enough that the paralyzed spasm can sublux bones. I have to go get them moved back into place. I've also cracked two teeth in the past month this way. I'm trying medications but they've only reduced the frequency so far. \n\nThe other is called confusional arousal. It can happen by itself (not as bad) or after paralysis. (very bad) I wake up and I'm very impaired. I don't recognize things I see everyday. Everything is so confusing and hard. My muscle control is impacted to varying degrees, sometimes I can't talk and making cereal is difficult. It happens because part of my brain is literally \"off\" by mistake, so I can't understand/process emotions. It's really easy for me to get scared. Like, primal mortal fear. I can't use reason, I don't understand the emotion, I can't make it stop. Sometimes I can't control it, I just start bawling like a baby and don't know what to do. I don't understand or remember conversations. If I have enough muscle control to talk, I will say nonsense or untrue thing and have no memory of it. \n\nThe abuse is that they're being triggered knowingly. These symptoms are awful, but I understand that noises in the morning will happen. I'm going to have these symptoms happen to me sometimes. That's life. Maybe I'll find a med that helps them happen less? The problem is that my grandfather has a history of severe schizophrenia in his family that sets in during old age, and he's developing it. Mind, this guy is like my parent. This is unlike him, I think he has a real problem and actually believes the things he's thinking.  \n\nHe keeps getting up at 5am, making a bunch of noise in the kitchen, slamming things sometimes (Not out of carelessness, he's agitated. Does it in the daytime too.), and then sits at the computer in a swivel chair and tries to nervously rock and fidget in it while reading stuff about the government for hours. It pops loudly and squeals because it's not meant for that. To be clear, he's nervously rocking the whole chair itself. It's an old metal one. Then he'll abruptly get up like there's a fire and stomp down the hall like he's furious, slam some things, stomp back, fidget, rinse and repeat until noon. Occasionally a car will go by and it sounds like he's actually scrambling to the window for his life, knocking things over and falling in the process. Gives me a heart attack even when I'm awake and expecting it. It's worse the more agitated he is. Among other things, I think he believes that everyone and everything is trying to control him. (He'll say so. Doctors, big pharma, scientists, car dealerships, news, media in general, the TV companies, me, my grandmother....)\n\nMy confusional arousal can last for several hours, and I'm not completely normal after so I can't drive, I might slur words and some things might still be mentally hard. But sometimes I'm functional by afternoon. If I get paralysis though, I can't do anything all day. I told my grandfather about this (Kindly, casually, without mentioning schizophrenia at all. I made it sound like I thought he just couldn't tell how loud he was because of hearing loss maybe?) because I was starting to have like 2 or 3 days a week like this and medication isn't helping. I'm developing some scary depression because of it. He went off the rails. He thinks I'm controlling him. He started stomping louder (Only some days? It's like he forgets?) and yelling/instigating things with me when I'm confused and can't stand up for myself on purpose. I think it's possible he thinks I was trying to control when he could speak? That being said, I'm unclear on that because I'm confused and having a fuzzy memory at those times too. I know he knows how bad these symptoms are. He would drive me to the chiropractor when I was in too much pain to drive myself to get those bones put back in. He knew about both broken teeth. He knows what sleep paralysis is and that I'm having literally 4 straight hours of it multiple times a week. Because of him. I don't know what's going on inside his head anymore.\n\nI'm using my disability status to get out of here and get a gov apartment. But, you only have so long after it's awarded to find one and he keeps triggering my paralysis on days I need to go see apartments or make calls. I'm getting kind of scared and hopeless. I can't do anything to move my life forward, I'm just suffering all the time. I think there's a number I can call to see if a social worker can help but it's for abuse and I've been having a hard time seeing it that way even though I'm devastated and miserable.", "subreddit": "abuse"}

This may not make much sense but I\u2019ll fumble through it in the hopes of getting some support. I\u2019m currently tangled in the web of two handsome, charming, and brilliant narcissists. I started dating A (my ex narc) a year and a half ago, on and off.  I\u2019ve known my best friend, B, about 5 years ago. I trusted A and B with all my heart and up until a few days ago and creeping through this sub, did I realize that you\u2019re both raging narcissists. A is more subtle. With B, you know right away. The first time I turned to my best friend, B, about my problems with A, he latched onto that ammunition. He continued to push it and bring it up more, the things that bothered me about A and our relationship. I look back now and he twisted my fucking thoughts and tore them to shreds. He completely pit me against my boyfriend and I believed every last word: that he only uses me to watch his kid, that he\u2019s fucking more than one women behind my back, that he treats me like garbage (all of this is still debatable). I pushed my boyfriend further and further away until I let it slip that I was confiding in B about our relationship issues. He was furious and ended things.

I am constantly splitting. I don\u2019t even know what\u2019s true anymore. I do know that my ex boyfriend no longer wants to be with my but still has his claws in me.

He told me he loved me very fast. I remember he told me I dressed like a slut. He told me to quit drinking . I got injured trying to punch him and falling because he told me I was dressed like a whore for a party I went to. It was shorts and a tank top . Like a flowey blouse type top. It was very hot out. He told me he didn\u2019t want me working my second job in a bar anymore . So I quit . His best friend at the time told me he was cheating on me and when I asked him about it he FLIPPPED OUT. punched his steering wheel cried . Blah blah . I found used condoms in his truck and we didn\u2019t use them at the time . He said they were old . I always believed him. I met a girl at a party that said he sexts her and shit. He said she was lying . Years have gone by with us fighting a lot . Me always feeling like the crazy one because I was honest about my past. I have ptsd panic disorder and depression also past drug abuse. His parents don\u2019t like me. I\u2019ve got in several fights with his mom. She told me tattoos are for whores and why am I so skinny and why do I always wear black and I should be over my past trauma and I\u2019m not good enough to marry her son. Lots of things . His dad stays quiet . I always felt inferior to them. All of them. Now I\u2019ve lived with him for about 5 years the house is in his name. I pay every single bill but the mortgage , I\u2019m a hairstylist I\u2019m not rolling in dough . He makes almost 100k a year. I cook I take care of the pets . I buy the groceries . I make sure I pick him up something to eat if I am not home to make something . He goes out with his friends a lot , goes to the strip club with them , plays hockey and softball and golfs as much as he can. He will ask if it\u2019s ok if he does these things and if I were to say no he will say \u201c ok fine I just will stay here all day everyday and not do anything \u201c if I don\u2019t fold the laundry or do the dishes right away it will just pile up. I\u2019ll leave it on purpose to see if he will do it. Then he will make passive agressive comments about it.

He told me I couldn\u2019t sit and freeload and going to school is stupid and I\u2019ll be in debt and maybe I should work more days ( I work 5 days a week) he kicked me out. Which he\u2019s done a few times but I didn\u2019t end up leaving. I left this last time. Went to my moms . He begged for me to come back. I brought a list of things I wanted to change . He tried it for a few days. And now it\u2019s back to how it was except he slapped a ring on my finger . There\u2019s much more I could say but am I being crazy? I want out.

So, I'm just looking for insight on a current situation. I have been in a narcissistic relationship in the past for about 4.5 years, and you would think I would be better at seeing the \"red flags\" However, I've been seeing someone for almost a year on and off, and for the last six months he's been deployed. So our main form of contact is over the phone and face time. There are times where he seems to be caring, and attentive but I almost noticed a pattern where as I get comfortable he seems to pull back. For instance the other day, he read my text and didn't reply for hours, and told me he was \"sleeping\" when I saw him actively online on Facebook for for a decent amount of time. I brought up the situation to him and he kinda brushed off what I said and how I felt.He said that he doesn't want to make this a big deal since \"we're figuring each other out\" and how he would \"never bluntly ignore me\" but this isn't the first time this is happening. If he's busy that's one thing, but the day this happened was his day off. After this happened, he then began to blow up my phone, and if I didn't respond he would keep sending me anything (literally anything at this point). Then it eventually progressed to overly sweet talking me which I took it almost as \"love bombing\" but I could be wrong. I told him that I don't feel comfortable with the overly sweet talking especially after an argument that wasn't solved/settled. He then preceded to say \"I'm always trying to sweet talk you\" \"Even when you're my gf I'll sweet talk you\"  \"Can I be sweet to you babe?\" I began to pull back at this point because I felt uncomfortable, and tried to explain how I felt and he eventually tried to tell me how the issue I brought up (the not replying for hours) began to bother \"him\" all day and how it's been upsetting him ALL day.. when he wasn't even mentioning anything regarding the situation until I said I am uncomfortable with the excessive texting and sweet talking. He then began to make me feel as if it was my fault somehow because I brought up how I felt about the  situation. As if it was a major inconvenience to him and that it was upsetting him apparently when not even once did he mention his feelings to me until after me saying I said I didn't enjoy the excessive sweet talking. I feel as if my gut is telling me he could potentially be a narcissist, and I don't ever want to be in a relationship with one again.. it took me so long to find myself after my last narc relationship :(", "subreddit": "NarcissisticAbuse"}

I think they were 23ish at this time. their marriage was troubled from the start, and my mom, fearing an early divorce, stopped taking her bc pills, without my father's knowledge, in order to get pregnant and \"save the marriage\" (rather, prevent him from leaving).\nunfortunately, it worked.\n\nmy dad stayed married to my mom despite the 25 years of abusive bullshit to come because he feared for my safety. my maternal great grandpa sexually abused my mom as a child. my mom was also clearly abusive. her family does not exactly treat one another well. during my parents divorce, I wished I had just never been born or been aborted to save my dad a quarter of a lifetime of suffering.\n\nnow... I still feel that way! and I feel so disgusting and wrong! recently, I've had trouble with my insurance, so I visited a Planned Parenthood for healthcare in the interim. they asked me many questions since it was my first visit, and a handful of them focused on if someone had ever tried to get me pregnant without my consent--not just actively violent assault, but sabotaging condoms, birth control pills, etc.\nit breaks my heart to know my dad basically had that done to him. it's not quite the same, but it's not entirely different, either. a baby shouldn't be used to control your spouse... it makes me feel very sad.\n\ni know my dad loves me, and he never, ever regrets having me and my brothers, and he loves us more than life itself.\ni can't quite figure out how to reconcile this feeling, though. does anyone have resources for this sort of thing? i don't know where to start. edit: most if not all of the things I've found in my initial web searches are for people who have been unwillingly impregnated. i would appreciate material that focuses on the child born of contraceptive sabotage, or for the person that was tricked into the impregnating. /edit\n\ntldr; my mother sabotaged her birth control to get pregnant without my father's consent, thus keeping him in an abusive relationship using me as a bargaining tool, and it makes me feel very sad and yucky\n\n[edited to fix typos &amp; add more clarification on what kind of resources im looking for. please feel free to dm me too (reddit has dms right?) if you would rather discuss stuff in private]", "subreddit": "survivorsofabuse"}

My mother is a product of her mother, and her mother, and so on, and showing any vulnerability in the slightest is a sign of weakness. In my case, not only is it a sign of weakness but also a way to \"victimize\" myself whenever in arguments. Granted, I don't make the situation any better when I myself subscribe to yelling, but it's hard to keep my emotions at bay when I know they are discredited as being solely \"issues \\[I\\] bring up \\[my\\]self\". \n\nI'm at home for three weeks for the holiday and thought I would be able to do it, but it's only the second day and I see things headed for worse. I originally bought this ticket home with my (now ex-) boyfriend of 4 years, with the anticipation of spending some days apart from my family. I'm unable to buy a ticket back home (since I live in another country and am financially struggling), unable to stay with friends (not because they haven't offered, but because of various reasons, i.e. financial, personal, etc.), and staying with extended family would only cause more problems that I can foreshadow being an issue in the long run. Not only this, but I also feel an intense amount of shame and guilt whenever I have/had thoughts of packing up my bags and leaving my family. This is only made worse when my family vocalizes myself as being \"ungrateful\", \"ashamed of \\[them\\]\", etc. \n\nOther than dealing with some extent of familial abuse, I should also mention that I am staying in the same house as my abuser, known to the rest of the world as my stepfather. About 7 years ago on Christmas day was when I first told my mom about the situation, but the status of their relationship has stayed the same. There are only 3 other people who know about this, none of which are extended family members, friends, or trusted therapists, but rather former flames/boyfriends. It isn't that I haven't tried counseling or anything, but again, the situation was complicated. When I was younger and actually going through the abuse, I didn't mention any of it to my first therapist for fear of literally tearing my immediate family apart (because of social services, etc.). The second therapist I saw much later during my BA (after much discussion with my last boyfriend) and this time I had mentioned the abuse, how it made me feel, etc. After a couple of sessions though, the therapist suggested I bring my mother in on a session, but this freaked me out and knew it wouldn't work with the type of mother I had, so I bailed. Now I'm stuck in a situation where I want therapy (without myself intentionally restricting knowledge), it's proven to be a bit difficult because of my expat status. In general though, I have a feeling that I might need to cut off my relationship with my immediate family, and by default, my extended family. This is certainly stressing me out even more, as these three weeks might be the last time I may see them, but I can't help to feel like shit for wanting to get to my much happier life abroad sooner.", "subreddit": "survivorsofabuse"}

He does not see them nor does he call to inquire about them. In fact, he has gone so far as to change his number after every interaction he has with me.  \n\nFor example: the last time he contacted me, he called from a 'blocked/restricted' phone number. He has instructed his family to NOT give me his number for any reason. (Of course, they follow his instructions &amp; refuse to give it to me -- they only 'offer' to pass along a message). \n\nOther times he will call, attack me, spend a few days texting me obscene, ignorant, hateful things then tell me, \"Have a great life. I'm changing my number so you can't harass/stalk me.\" And then in a day or two, the number is defunct. \n\nHe used to tell me years ago that if he doesn't want to be found, he knows how to disappear and become impossible to contact. He would threaten me with this disappearing/MIA act when we would fight really bad. He would tell me I'd never be able to get ahold of him or see him ever again ...which at the time, he knew really tore me up inside. And in a way, I felt like having kids with him would result in having some form of contact with him for a multitude of years. \n\nI just wonder ...since he is definitely a narc/sociopath why he ghosts me more than he tries to be meddling in my life or with the kids?! I mean, I should be thankful and grateful he's MIA. He can't screw up the kids or destroy my life anymore. But I ponder the way he just left, changing numbers and just being so aloof. \n\nI know, deep down, it's a good thing; that I've stood up and voiced my disgust with him &amp; he knows he has zero control over me anymore. So, he's decided to get the hell on and not try to hoover or harass me as often. He can't get money from me anymore which was what he was doing for the last year of our contact/relationship. \n\nIt's been 3-months since our last contact. I don't know if he'll ever try to contact me again, especially now that the divorce is finalized and it's obvious he has no rights to the kids unless he goes back to court to petition that. \n\nIn the end ... I just imagined he would be always in some type of contact with me. But maybe since he's 1,000-miles away, has a girlfriend and a new life it is so much easier for him to erase his past with me and our kids?\n\nI guess I'm confused but I should simply be happy and move on. However, a small part of me always worries -- when might be the next random time he could pop up? He is this wildcard in my life that I simply don't know when or how to expect his next appearance in my life. As much as I hope this means, forever he'll be out of the picture -- I have this deep seeded worry he'll find a way to pop up in five years, after I've done all the hard work to heal and remove him from my conscious; so he's only just a memory.\n\nAhhhh ... thank you for anyone who reads this.

Its happend before, so the natural, yet selfdestructive way, is to start question if its your fault. \n\nIn my situation, I verbally told him there was no consent to touch me in my sleep. We had only just gotten back together, and though I was okay with it in the past, I had been assaulted by a friend in my sleep in the 6 months we were broken up, and had absolutely no desire to do that anymore. My boyfriend did it regardless, which to the regular person would have been obvious, the wrong thing. I remember him touching my vagina, he doesnt. I think I wrote it down somewhere, and will find it. \n\nIts difficult to understand someone cant connect those two things. I took it as a mistake, and then went on to clearly tell him not to do that again. But he did, two nights after, I woke up to him touching my butt while he masturbated next to me. This is where its very clear that he crossed that line. \n\nWhat have followed since trying to confront him with it, has been an absolute hell. The only way to forgive and feel safe moving on is if you know the other person has remorse and never would do it again. But when he doesnt think its wrong, and he cant admit to what he did and what that behaviour is, then Im never going to be able to know it wont happen again.\n\nI have since then been told Im crazy. That I should just let it go already. That its okay to do so because we have had sex before and its okay because Im his girlfriend.

I've worked for my boss for 3.5 years. There have been red flags from the start, but being as how it was only she and I for the first two years, I was quick to dismiss them in order to keep peace in our little office environment. Now that we have moved into an office with others, mostly young men in their mid-twenties, she has gone off the chain with the attention seeking behavior and theatrics. She is mid-fourties and behaves as if she is 16. Cheating on her husband with a new man every week (literally, and I've known about this for years) and now suddenly joining a band (she will sing all day long in the office, fishing for compliments on her voice-- but its quite the opposite, we are all sick to death of her). She is absolutely delusional regarding her appearance. She thinks she is beautiful and shares that opinion very openly. She has a very \"worn hard and put up wet\" appearance. Brags about her intelligence (although she has no formal education) and truly believes she is a 'socialite' in our community. I'm at a loss. I want to quit my job and get as far away from her as I can, except I love my job. I'm in a public employee and I'm able to pursue my Master's degree while I'm at work, I'm 3 minutes from my kids' school (single mom, here) and leaving would affect the way my student loans are set up to be repaid (and eventually forgiven). So, I wait it out. I know she can't hang onto this job much longer (has gotten bored). I'm looking for support from others who have histrionic narcs in their life. These people are delusional energy vampires. I still cannot wrap my head around this insatiable need for attention. Its literally a sickness!", "subreddit": "NarcissisticAbuse"}

understand what im trying to explain\n\nI met her 4 Months before she went studying abroad.\n\nWe fell in love and there was love bombing at the beginning of the \"Relationship\" we kept it secret because there was another guy around who had a \"crush\" on her and she didnt want to hurt him.\n\nWe kept it secret but 2-3 weeks later someone told this guy that this girl is in an romatic relationship with me and ofc she lied to him that \" its not true.. etc.\" she literally gaslighted him.\n\nThe first 1 1/2 months were great she love bombed me i realy thought \"she is the one\"\n\nShe told me stuff like \"all my ex\u00b4s cheated on me\" \"they were controlling\" blablaand ofc i wanted to safe her i wanted to be her hero\n\nafter the first 1 1/2 months i got a feeling that something isnt right and i saw a bunch of \"red flags\" and called her out on this behaivor (Stuff like Words dont match her actions)  and at this point the \"devaluation\" began.\n\nShe called me Names, tryed to attack my selfesteem but i didnt realized it was a devaluation phase, i saw it more as a disrepectful manner and dumped her, 3 days before she went studying abroad.\n\nI went no contact and she hooverd 20 days later, we got back together and she asked things like\n\n\"but you dont get another girl or\"?and stuff like this which gave me the feeling that she wants to be exclusive\n\nBut i also got the feeling she WANTS me to stay loyal while she want to do what ever she want so i asked her in the first skype talk if we are \"exclusive\"\n\nAnd ofc she said \"no no i dont want to be exclusive because i dont know if my feelings change blabla\"\n\nSo i told her that i dont want to stay in contact with her and she went crazy\n\n2 days later she told me \"okay i want to be exclusive\"\n\nI accepted and everthing was fine till she called me two weeks later that she want an open relationship again\n\ni asked her what happend and my buddy who is studying abroad with her told her \"remeber you are exclusive with \"ME\"\n\nhe remembered her because she went drunk with some other dude in her bedroom.\n\nWe talked and ofc she didnt told me about that  situation with the guy so i accepted and we ended the conversation\n\nno contact for 6 days and in this time i got a rly bad gut feeling that she cheated on me\n\nshe massaged me \" are u mad at me\"?\n\nand i told her man i dont know but i have a feeling we do not match and this long distance situation is to hard for us so the best solution for me is to cut it and to meet up if youre back in town. i alos met some other girls so i have to cut it.\n\nShe went crazy and told me \"dont give up\" but 2 text  later \"oh i didnt know that with this other women but you should put your energy in her not in me\"\n\nI didnt replied.\n\non the next day she changed her Whatsapp Status to \"you going to miss me even the bad things about me\"\n\nSo i thought i maybe made i mistake and told her \"Lets sit down and talk about this situation\"\n\nBut she went cold and mad and at this point everything went worse and worse\n\nafter i asked her if she\u00b4s seeing someone new and she told me \"Yes 1 month ago\"\n\nI told her that we were exclusive in this time and if she cheated on me she can fuck off and never call me again\n\nand then the gaslighting began\n\nNo it was after we went open\n\nwe are not in a relationship since months why you dont get it so you cant be mad at meI ended the relationship back in \"Country\"  so you cant be mad at mei only agreed to be exclusive so i dont lose youi dont know what wrong in your headi thought that when i came back we can talk and maybe stay friends\n\nso i told her \"Listen i dont want to be your friend, i see you as a romantic partner so call me when youre back in town and interested in dating.\n\nShe told me\n\ni realized that we dont match, we are completly different and no i dont fell in love with someone new and i dont have another guy aroundand im just not ready for a relationship\n\nI told her to call me when shes back\n\nShe said\n\nYes we can talk but there is no chance for a relationship.\n\nNo contact 20 days now\n\nThis is not everything because i dont know how to explain it but i list some facts below\n\nShort story\n\nMy buddy remembered her that we are exclusive.after that She wanted an open relationship.After i told her that i want to cut the contact and that i see someone else she went crazyAfter i told her my thoughts about this situation and that she might seeing someone knew she said \"she kissed someone\" (This guy is studying with her and hes living in the same city as we do)She gas lighted me that she didnt cheat and that there is no other guyShe realized that we dont match and she dont want a relationship (discard)\n\nSome Facts\n\nMy buddy told me \"he dont see any sign that she is in a romatic relationship with him\" (ofc shes hiding it like she did with me)\n\nShe lied to me about her ex\u00b4si talked to her best friend and she also got some serious problems with her (lying, gas lighting)She told me that im the first man after a year she fell for) Bullshit\n\nthere was a guy at the beginning at 2019 for two months then she jumped to the guy she had before me but it was only a platonic relationship (i dont know if its true but her best fried is telling me thats the case and she would knew if she had a fling with him) then she jumped to me at june and now she jumped to this other guy abroad.\n\nI dont know if shes a monkeybrancher or a covert narcissict\n\nafter i learned about all this stuff i see all this points\n\n\\-love bombing-future faking-devaluation-after i told her that i have a gut feeling that she is seeing someone new she blocked every try to work things out she began being rude and disrespectful (devaluation while grooming new supply?)-lying and lying about her past-gas lighting-blame shifting- projection (she is the victim and its all my fault

I am not a huge fan of the holidays so I know it doesn't help with my current situation. There is a constant battle with in myself of just not feeling like I was enough to knowing that I deserved so much better. \n\nMy ex reached out a few times with different fake numbers two weeks ago. I ignored it the first time. Then answered the next time and fell for his hoover attempt. He told me he missed me and I longed to hear that. I wanted to believe there is a part of him that misses me in some way. And I do think there is something in him that probably misses what I did for him. He asked me to tell him I love him, and I did because I do. And I wanted him to truly feel that even though he probably didn't. I didn't think it was some chance for us to reconcile but I thought maybe that he had let some of the anger go. I knew it was a step backwards but I needed to see him for whatever reason. And of course, I haven't heard from him at all since then. I stupidly reached out to him before my trip and told him it was good seeing him and I wish him the best of luck and hope he finds happiness.\n\nThen I find out two days after we slept together, he took a new woman to his holiday party. He has introduced her to his family and even posted his Facebook cover photo as them. This hurt more than I ever thought it would because he kept me as a secret. And I can't  make sense why he is in such a rush to show her off. He told me that he had demons and couldn't handle a relationship and he was unavailable and he used and lied to every woman he has ever dated. Has he magically changed in less than 2 months with all that? Realistically, no. But I can't help but wonder if I set him up for something better. That I showed him that he needed to man up and be better for his children. That he realized how much he hurt people and he wanted to try to be better. That he wanted to stop being the bad guy like he told me once. I feel like that I wasn't good enough for him to want to be better but maybe she is. That maybe if I set more healthy boundaries or had more self respect to stand up to him, things would have been different. I feel so much jealousy to this woman I don't even know because I feel like she is getting everything that I wanted from him. And it seems so unfair because I tried so hard and I was patient. I can't seem to make sense of any of it and my brain keeps trying to wrap my head around it.\n\nThere is a small part of me that I keep fighting to bring out. It is there but I just don't feel it quite yet. I know that I deserve better than he treated me. And it doesn't matter if he changed or not, he still was terrible to me. The man told me he would effing kill me and told me I wasn't woman enough. He lied and manipulated and used me. And I sit and wonder why he doesn't want to be with me. I feel desperate and pathetic for still feeling that way. I really can't see him treating her that way  and have no absolute way to back that up but it just this thought I can't seem to shake.\n\nI can't explain this to my friends or family because they don't understand. I don't see my therapist until after the holidays. I really don't know how I am going to get through these holidays.", "subreddit": "NarcissisticAbuse"}

Like, no wonder I nearly dropped out. I was too busy handling this dude's crap, obviously. \n\nAfter him I hopped through 3 more relationships with guys of my age, but none worked out because I needed serious help and they just couldn't know. I wanted to be liked and I hated to be alone, it was just unbearable. I was _pretty_ and friendly and so open so I didn't really have any problems with it, I guess. With... certain guys.

Well, keep reading:\n\nThe first cracks in our relationship started when her selfish family continued to demand us to run errands and ask for \"handouts\" whenever her SSI deposit would come in.\n\nThe worst began.When she started having \"flashbacks\" and other fake ptsd moments from her previous \"abusive\" marriage.\n\nSince her family didnt want to help and didnt show her support from her failed marriage they just let our relationship crumbel into a living nightmare of fighting, stress and constant blaming and gaslighting.\n\nI made the mistake of just chalking her behavior as part of the recovery process and since at the time i wasnt aware of how the mental recovery process worked i just rolled with the verbal \"punches\".\n\nAfter a while my parents started trying to get involved and she noticed this and she began the heavy push for us to move into our own place reguardless if we had our son or not.\n\nMind you at this point she had me under her influence and dispite the verbal abuse and mind games i would still do things for her because i cared and loved her.  (Even though it was becoming more and more like enslavement later on)\n\nWe found a place in what would be the worst part of town we could find.  There was constant fighting among the neighbors, drama and at times drunken spouts on occasion.\n\nI got a job at the nearby walmart, worked my ass off for every dime i made while putting up with mostly taking care of my son and attempting to keep the house clean.  Well, failing actually becuase whenever someone else wanted something, my ex would make us both drop everything to help them and on countless occasions allowed questionable people move in and stay in our rental for long periods of time.\n\nMind you we were barely living off my paycheck, her monthly deposits, TANIF and food stamps but whenever someone needed help or needed something, my ex would use up what precious food/money/etc we had to give it away.\n\nMind you, she would still fight with me on everything and even threaten to leave with our son and so on.\n\nFun fact: she was also trying to get her kids from the previous marriage during all this before the kid's father and new wife decied to move out of country to get away from her and her vengful family.\n\nUnfortunately we couldn't keep the place and got evicted.  During this time she met another guy, some youngster no few years younger than I (i was 28 and he was 24)  and my ex and this guy fell head over heels for each other.\n\nNow at this point you think \"didnt she keep this a secret?\"  Nope, after getting another job (got terminated from my last one twice) and working the night shift, this guy's friends got her crossfaded and they ended up doing stuff togeather.\n\nShe conffessed to me about this the next morning.  Which, fearing i would lose everything at this point, i told her it was okay and she took it as a green light to open our crumbeling relationship for a second guy.\n\nThe twisted part is that she had me so brainwashed that would be blaming myself for everything and make myself watch when they did stuff at night.\n\nStack this ontop od the guys she would sleep with whenever she decied i pushed her away to a point desperation.\n\nThankfully it turns out this punk was an SO and after being rendered homeless (got kicked out of another house because of their constant fighting and drama). She ended up tipping the athorities off about him being too close to children (he was camping with another couple that had a daughter) and soon four staters came to the park to collect him.\n\nA reliving fact:  my parents intervened and took custody of our son becuase his mother was OBVIOUSLY incapable in raising the child and i was too damaged to raise him my self.\n\nA month after that, we ended up camping in the mountains near my home town and this is were my nightmare starts to turn.\n\nShe, having gone the way of the free spirted rageaholic, she had been sleeping with one emo slob that had clung onto her while visiting her highschool crush while i just played the role of the drone with the car.\n\nOne night before getting off from a closing shift, she got dropped off by her high school boi and subtly bragged about having a \"relaxing night\" and mentioned something about jello legs.\n\nFor having to put up with this crud for five years at this point, i had grown numb to her antics. After letting her into my car i went back inside to finish up.\n\nI get off, get to the car and we sit for a moment beofre she starts to smoke a bowl (weed), respecting my place of work. I drove us to a near by walmart parking lot.\n\nThere she starts to talk to me about something and when i try to say something she snaps.\n\nShe raised her voice, yelling at me about how i dont care, i treate her like crap and started comparing me to her exes (yes that SO was considered an ex).  Then, seeing how im her only pawn left, she starts threatening me.\n\n\"I should hit you!\" She seeths, \"but honestly, you are not worth it,\"  she then dumps her fury into the head rest of the seat she sat in.\n\nAfter a while of watching her pounding the crap out of her seat, she stops to see how im reacting to this which honestly was indifference.\n\nSo, since i couldnt cry for her anymore just dropped my head as a fake sign of acceptance of my place in this two person higharchy.\n\nAfter that we drove from town back to our camping spot on BLM land.  She \"snuggles\" up to her side guy while i slept alone in my corner of the tent.\n\nThe next morning, thankfully was the start of a three day weekend so what follows i was able to do so with out worrying about being late to work.\n\nWell, it was quiet that morning, we all got up, our gracious hosts, a man and his fiance at the time, decied that today was the day we moved further into the forest to find a suitable spot to set up an off-the-grid encampment.\n\nMe, her and the rest of our homeless party piled into their van and we drove down a road.\n\nNow heres a final fact:  during a fallout with anpther couple we camped with, the guy got pissed at me, went into his storage unit, stole my PS4 and dwindeling game collection and sold it. He the Gave the money to these people we currently stayed with for gas.\n\nNow, we eventually found a spot, some early century logging road that was wide enough to accomadate some platforms for tents and other pernament fixtures that would allow us to settle till we all got the money to get back on our feet.\n\nOr so we thought...\n\nShe limps onto the scene, because she was faking a leg problem out of her deteriorated sanity; and starts voiceing her own version of this camp.  The argument started over the reason behind the platforms.\n\nDuring this argument, she would be glancing over to me.  After the guy gave up and walked away, she pulls me aside and starts haseling me:\n\n\"Why didn't you step in?\" She demands,\n\"You should of stood up for me!\"  Then she looses it by rehashing the same things she lashed out with the night before.\nBlaming me for this-that\nComparing me to her exs, saying im worse than them both.\nI didnt care about our son and so on...\n\n\"Also,\" she adds in middle of this, \"we are in the forest, SO I CAN SCREAM HOWEVER I WANT!\"\n\nIn her verbal throw down at me, she smashes the walking stick and she collapses.  Dropping the hint that i should help her up.\n\nHowever, i just turned around and started to walk away.\n\n\"Go ahead!\" She sobs, \"walk away, you are just like the rest!\" As i walk further away she starts screaming some other profanities but they faded as i walked back to our hosts van.\n\n\"But clockwork, were did that side guy go?\"\nWell, being a sensitive guy and not wanting and not liking confrontations, he took a stroll to get away from the fighting.\n\nAbout twentiy minutes later and rejoining with our hosts, we ditched them for a short while till we eventually stopped to let them catch up.\n\nMy ex was staring holes into me the whole short drive back to camp.\n\nOur hosts took a drive to get away from the drama and stress while my ex confronted me again in our tent.\n\nMind you this was one of those four room cabin tents with out the dividers.\n\nShe rehashes everything again then starts grabbing me. She yanks on my shirt screaming, point blank, into my face then shoves me back.\n\nI noticed to late what she did next. Fueled with hate and venom for me, she swung a bitchslap that not only connected but knocked me down.\n\nIn that moment, old me woke up, she stepped up to probably continue swinging, but stopped as she noticed me defensively putting my hands to brace and to catch any punches or slaps.\n\nMy mind spun to life, when that slap connected with my face i knew, this would only get worse.\n\nI slowly stood up from my sleeping pad, feet in a stance,\n\"Okay, i'm sorry, im a dick, im an ass, im sorry.\" I finally say looking at the demon in the eye.\n\"Oh, is that whats its gonna take to get a reaction out of you?\" She then scoffs then walks back to curl up to her sissy guy.\n\nMy mind went to work, it was time to get out.  I dug out a note pad and wrote \"she hit me and i need help.\" Then stayed quiet while gaining the help of everyone in this camp (side boi included)\n\nAfter managing to get outside and to do quick assessment on what was in my car is when our hosts came back i then quietly showd them my note.\n\nThe guy's fiance then got the idea to pull my ex out for a drive.  It took a good tense ten minutes to get her to come out of the tent and into the van. That side guy in tow.\n\nAs me and our host waited in the camp, we both watched the van slowly drive away.\n\n\"Three,\" we both counted, \"two, one.\" As soon that van disapeard around the corner i went for the final part of my plan.\n\nI ran to my side of the tent, zipped it open, scooped everything up, tossed it into my car. Dug out a smoke peice i had and gave it to him as a \"thank you.\"\n\nGot in the car and drove quickly drove down hill.\n\nAt one point, i pulled over to dump every thing that wasnt mine, clothes, luggage and other junk onto the side of the dirt road. I left a note then got back into the car and drove on.\n\nI watched my phone till i had reception then dialed my father:\n\n\"Hello.\"\n\"Dad?\"\n\"Yeah?\"\n\"Open the gate, im coming home.\"\n\"Uhh, okay, see you in a bit.\"\n\nAfter hanging up i didnt cheer, nor cried nor shouted.\n\n\"Im out,\" i realized, \"im finally out!\"  I only got misty eyed as i drove home.\n\nAnd the rest, folks, is history...\n\nUgh, sorry folks, you asked a simple two questions and i dump this out. Uhh, if need be ill move this else where or whatever.  Anyways, that is my psycho ex story and im also a writer so i couldn't help but put more \"oomph\" into my sad tale.\n\nAnyways, As soon as i pressed post my phone started acting up but i was able to copy this and paste it here before i gave up on this.  Hope you all learn something from this and will awnser any questions you guys might have.", "subreddit": "abuse"}

Examples in post.\n\n\nI (23F) was in an emotionally abusive, toxic, awful relationship with my nex (24M) for over 4 years. From the very beginning something didn\u2019t quite sit right with me. The way he would talk to waiters didn\u2019t sit right, kind of standoffish with them. While I always like to ask how there day is going (because wait staff are people too) and they deserve a friendly human interaction while working, and anywhere. (Red flag #1) as the relationship was getting more serious and I was feeling comfortable with really expressing how I felt, if something came up that bothered me, I\u2019d bring it up and he would turn around, and tell me to \u201cstop being so pissy\u201d which would actually make me upset, and when I would tell him to stop calling me that because I didn\u2019t like it, he would proceed to say \u201cthen stop being so Pissy\u201d (not respecting boundaries, red flag #2) (calling me names, red flag #3) (a clear lack of respect for me, GIANT FUCKING RED FLAG #4) as things went on, this did stop happening, kind of. Instead of him calling me pissy, he would just disregard my feelings, tell me I\u2019m overreacting or that he \u201cdidn\u2019t mean it like that\u201d while at the same time not taking the moment to acknowledge that his action hurt my feelings. No matter how many times I told him that it felt like he was disregarding my feelings, at the end of whatever argument, it was me who was apologizing because he made me feel like it was my fault that we were fighting in the first place, turning the argument around on me when all I wanted was for us to talk about what was going on. This happened throughout the entire relationship. \n\nThe point where I really felt unsafe telling my ex ANYTHING. \n\nA really big thing that happened was when I got sexually assaulted by someone I used to know. Which, for anyone who has gone through an assault of any kind, especially sexual, will know how fucking terrifying it is to be in a situation like that. He made me feel like i was responsible for it happening because I willingly got into the car with this person. To add context, this person and I grew up across the street from each other, him and all the neighbourhood kids and I were very good friends and really close, and some of us still are. I went to the mall in my city after my Ex went to university over 2 hours away. (I was sad and didn\u2019t wanna stay home) so this person messaged me wanting to meet up, I said sure as I thought it would be nice to catch up. BOY WAS I WRONG! I got in his car as I suggested we go for coffee, he said sure. While we were driving he kept asking me if I was in an open relationship which I said no. And at this point, he\u2019s not telling me where we\u2019re going, I have no idea where I am. He drives us to his house which is outside of the city. I tell him I\u2019m ready to go home. He says he needs to grab something inside and for me to come in. I go inside, stay by the door. He\u2019s making me feel weird for not wanting to make myself at home. I\u2019m stranded as I didn\u2019t drive at this point. Without going into a crazy amount of detail as we will all be here till after Christmas, he put his hands down my pants and wouldn\u2019t stop even after saying no repeatedly. I told him to take me home. I told my ex what happened the day after and he was FREAKING out at me, asking me why I went in the house, why I met with him, why his hands were in my pants then ended that wonderful conversation with \u201cI need some time to think\u201d not once did he ask if I was okay, NOT ONCE. And it was that day where I didn\u2019t feel safe or comfortable telling him how I really felt, that was the tipping point. \n\n\nAs expected, I slowly got worn down. Trying to stand up for myself and constantly getting dismissed and disregarded was exhausting. I would just say sorry to end fights. My self esteem was going way down, I went from being outspoken, confident and happy to being quiet, not really having an opinion on anything, feeling like there was something wrong with me. I couldn\u2019t even look people in the eyes, I still kind of can\u2019t. I\u2019m a shell of the person I once was, and I got bullied into this sad state of submission. I started to lie about how I felt and certain things because it was easier, and safer than telling him the truth. He got me pregnant (I didn\u2019t keep the baby) he was hanging out with a lady friend And I wasn\u2019t happy about because, after we broke up in early 2019, we got back together in July, and my intuition was going into fucking HYPERDRIVE! She gave him expensive cologne which, when I said that\u2019s fucking weird and makes me uncomfortable, he said \u201cit\u2019s not actually expensive because she got a discount\u201d BITCH I DON\u2019T FUCKING CARE, it\u2019s weird for someone who\u2019s not your girlfriend to gift you expensive cologne like that. Not only that, we got high on shrooms one night and his roommates, him and I were all in his room and suddenly he looks at me and goes \u201cyou\u2019re extremely toxic, and I don\u2019t want you here, get out\u201d he would constantly tell me to get out, he also broke up with me like 4 times that night. And the next day, who does he go to to talk to? Her. And what does she do, give him a key to her apartment WHICH IS SUPER SUSPICIOUS. I also told him it was weird and I didn\u2019t like it. Of course he made up some shit where \u201cshe\u2019s just being a good friend\u201d (oh, might I add, they had sex a month after we broke up in early 2019) it\u2019s at this point I started to develop anxiety, I started having mental breakdowns for, seemingly no reason. I started to suspect he was cheating on me. He told me I was overthinking things, It gave me major trust issues. I started to feel like I was going crazy. He\u2019s a fucking garbage person who I hope everything bad happens to, as I do believe if you treat someone who cared about you and tried to do everything for you, as badly as he did to me, you deserve it. \n\nThere are a ton more examples, but I\u2019ve been writing this for hours while at work LOL\n\nI\u2019m NEVER going back to being treated so badly ever again, he turned into the thing he hated as a kid. He turned into the bully who used to bully him. Then he bullied me. He used my love as a weapon against me. He used my kindness against me. He manipulated me. Emotionally abused me. Gaslit me. Cheated on me. Disrespected me. Hurt me. He Almost broke me. \n\nAlmost. \n\nMade me feel like I was losing my mind when I brought up anything. \n\nThere\u2019s a saying I have and it goes \u201ckarma always comes to collect, and that bitch collects with interest\u201d  because if you do bad things to others, you\u2019ll get served more than what you dish out. \n\nIt breaks my heart to know I put myself through this for so long. It breaks my spirit to know that someone willingly treated me like this. \n\nNever again.", "subreddit": "NarcissisticAbuse"}

You\u2019ll thank the lord that he\u2019s gone for good.\n\nOh, and when that call comes (and it will, because they can smell it when you\u2019re doing better), you\u2019ll pick up and cheerfully say, \u201cHey I\u2019m sorry I can\u2019t talk right now, I\u2019m busy.

He may still believe that he can reach you somehow. With the phone call he\u2019ll know that you\u2019re around, and he\u2019ll have no other option but to accept that you\u2019re ignoring him. He\u2019ll know you flipped the script, and likely feel embarrassed. He\u2019ll decide you\u2019re no longer an available source. You\u2019re just like him now. You\u2019ve got his number and that won\u2019t change. He can\u2019t fool you anymore.

Once I realised I stopped talking to them. They tried hoovering but I continued ignoring them. Once I had to see them again they seemed to have just come unhinged at the sight of me, I felt uncomfortable and found it upsetting having them on social media so I removed them. I also just refused to look at or acknowledge them in person. \n\nI can admit that this is because I'm very deeply hurt by their actions. I've been through this before with someone much more important, so I know how to deal with the painful thoughts like 'maybe he does care' 'he treats her better than me' etc. I don't want to see him or be near him but we share close mutual friends and I refuse to stop doing things I enjoy just because he's there. \n\nI've done well avoiding and ignoring him even though he seems uncomfortably fixated on me. I feel angry, spiteful and anxious the whole time which feels terrible and I'm scared is pushing me towards exploding. Your casual observer generally can't see that his behavior is antagonistic or inappropriate because it's so subtle. He wants a reaction - any reaction and I won't give it. \n\nI have a birthday for one of my closest friends coming up very soon and we're going to be seated at the same table. I'm so sure he's going to do try to do something to upset me. I don't want to go but it just looks like a 'scorned lover' situation when it's a 'you've been gaslighting me and crazy-making for months and I'm so angry with you and devastated I let you but I 'can't really prove it'.\n\nWhat would you do? We're supposed to be kept separate on the night but he likes to be near me now for reasons I don't understand and I feel like he'll try to get close to me. I am jealous of his new supply even though I acknowledge why I feel that way and am not interested in him at all - how can I work through that in the moment? I literally will not look at him or acknowledge him - should I break that just for that night to look polite and make sure I don't ruin the dinner? \n\n I've coped by remaining mindful and present in the moment and in the conversations I'm having with others - but this will be the first time I'll have to actually be sat at a table with him in months. But I'm usually emotional for days afterwards because I'm just plagued by both horrible, spiteful things I'd like to say or gentle, kind things I'd like to say all gathered under the umbrella of 'closure will never happen, all discourse is pointless and unproductive and these thoughts are stupid'. \n\nThank you for reading this.", "subreddit": "NarcissisticAbuse"}

We used to live in the same city because we attend the same college, but my Nex (21M) moved back to our hometown because he doesn\u2019t have any friends at college &amp; whenever we break up he returns home to be with his old friends from high school.\n\nWhile we were dating, we combined a lot of our mutual friends together and we would hang out with them in big groups. I don\u2019t think our mutual friends know he is a narcissist, but they definitely know something is not right with him. All of our mutual friends seem to like me better because I don\u2019t bring the chaos and drama that comes from being around my Nex. They\u2019ve told me this in various ways over the years.\n\nWhenever I return home from college and hang out with our mutual friends, I have an amazing time and really enjoy their company. The problem is, now me and my Nex are broken up for good and I have no desire to return to the relationship. His toxicity has scarred me and left me very broken and I really don\u2019t want ANYTHING to do with him anymore.\n\nI\u2019m trying to decide whether to meet up and hang out with our mutual friends when I return home from college next week, but I\u2019m unsure of what will happen or how I will feel.\n\nSome of our mutual friends were my Nex\u2019s friends first that he has known since birth practically, and I know that although they enjoy my company they will most definitely take his side. I\u2019m not so much thinking about hanging out with those people, but rather the friends that I have known for many years that I was friends with first before I knew my Nex.\n\nSpecially, I have one best friend that I have had a very close relationship with. We have been friends for many years and it is one of my most cherished friendships. Unfortunately, my Nex lies to her constantly about me and has created a lot of distance between us. We don\u2019t talk much, but whenever we hang out in person it is always incredible and I absolutely love spending time with her. My Nex has been living in the same town as her now for several months and I\u2019m positive they have hung out, so I\u2019m sure she has heard many new lies about me since seeing her last.\n\nSince he has been living in our hometown for the past few months now, I know all of them have been hanging out together regularly. I feel like when I return home, it will make me upset if my friends that I have known longer refuse to hang out with me or if they hang out with my Nex instead of me.\n\nI don\u2019t know if it\u2019s worth trying to spend time with them, or if my Nex has ruined my reputation enough that they will want nothing to do with me. He\u2019s very good at lying to them about me and many times during our relationship I had to talk to mutual friends and explain that my Nex was lying and that I would never do the things he said. Every time I have this discussion with them, they say \u201cohhhh, that makes so much more sense, I knew you would never do x/y/z.\u201d Yet the lies continue.\n\nI\u2019m not sure if spending time with them will remind me of my time with my Nex and make me feel sad that we are broken up. I\u2019m not sure if he has trash talked me enough to the point that they don\u2019t want to be friends with me. &amp; most importantly I\u2019m not sure if I want to risk reaching out and getting let down by my friends. That would probably hurt me more than the breakup.\n\nTLDR; Nex has been hanging out with our mutual friends recently and has likely ruined my reputation with them. Should I still try and be friends with them?\n\nThank you for reading sorry it\u2019s long!", "subreddit": "NarcissisticAbuse"}

I\u2019m basically no contact with this person (we used to text multiple times in a day) and when there\u2019s a text or some other contact that he initiates, I go gray rock. I wouldn\u2019t even do that much but we had  some other friends in common.

No contact - As hard as it might be, don\u2019t reach out.  Nothing good will come of it.  They will try to manipulate you again, as they have so many times before.  \n3. Assume they are stalking you - assume that they read every comment, post, or picture you post on even the most obscure online outlets. \n4. Prepare for slander - they will slander you both publicly and privately.  They will orchestrate slander campaigns against you in public (ie social media) and they will destroy your character to their new audience/sources.  Be prepared for their new circle of fiends to believe you\u2019re a monster.  Don\u2019t take it personally.\n4.  Legal action - they will threaten you with legal action.  99/100 this is smoke and mirrors.  They couldn\u2019t possibly stop focusing on themselves long enough actually get anything done. \n5. They think you\u2019re stupid - they assume you believe every lie, you are scared by every threat, regardless of how absurd it is.  \n6.!Everything is your fault - since they are special, they couldn\u2019t have possibly done anything wrong.  You didn\u2019t meet their \u201cneeds\u201d (which are endless and bottomless) so you\u2019re at fault for their bad behavior.  \n\n\nGood luck, friends.

How much do we have to give up to be in a relationship with this person?

I\u2019ve been going nuts trying to figure things out. \n\nSo I just realized over the last few months in therapy that I was a parentified child. I remember at the age of 6 or 7 hearing my mom talk to me about how my dad didn\u2019t do much to help out, and she also would use me as a conflict mediator. For example: \u201cAsk your dad for X. He loves you, he won\u2019t say no to you.\u201d Or I\u2019d get used as the carrier pigeon if my parents were arguing. (\u201cTell your dad X\u201d or \u201ctell your mom Y.\u201d) It happened often enough that I can\u2019t remember many specific incidents; I just remember that I got used as mediator and therapist. \n\nI\u2019ve been my mom\u2019s therapist and confidante almost my whole life and I\u2019m sick of it. It\u2019s exhausting. But is parentification really so bad? \n\nOn top of all this, my mom can swing between being super super sweet (IMO to the point of being overbearing) or extremely angry and accusative. When I was five and didn\u2019t clean my room, she went on a tirade about how ungrateful I was and asked me if I thought she was Cinderella waiting on me hand and foot. (Ouch, I was just being a kid?) It left me feeling horrible about myself and I knew I couldn\u2019t argue back against the accusation of doing things on purpose to spite her, because I would be wrong anyway. \n\nJust 2 years ago, I accidentally double-booked myself for Thanksgiving and my mom blew up, accusing me of doing it on purpose and blaming me for not remembering things correctly. I honestly forgot but she spun it so that I\u2019d been inconsiderate and not paying attention to her. She gave me the silent treatment. She wasn\u2019t happy until I agreed to go to her Thanksgiving event first and then Friendsgiving. \n\nShe used to blow up at me a lot when I was younger, and I was always waiting for the other shoe to drop. I never knew when I would swing from \u201cbest kid in the world\u201d to \u201cungrateful/spoiled/lazy/rude.\u201d She is less temperamental now that she is retired and my parents\u2019 relationship has improved, but I don\u2019t trust the niceness. She threw a little fit last year when I told her I couldn\u2019t come down on the 26th (due to work, and I\u2019d just spent 1.5 weeks on a family vacation with her)...she assumed I was just abandoning her. \n\nMost of the time she\u2019s nice...too nice. Tells me that I was a hit with her friends at dinner parties, and they were envious at how obedient/respectful I was, showing up at family gatherings. (Asian thing.)

I knew the training was in the works but this is the first time it's finally been put together and I'm not sure when it will happen again. I told her I wanted to sign up for it too. She said cool, but also \\[my Nex\\] will be there.\n\nHe and I work in the same industry and have run into each other several times this year. At first it was really scary and difficult, but I've slowly cut out any signs of him and his flying monkeys in my life, so recently when he's shown up to events I've successfully ignored him. I explained to my friend that I've run away from lots of situations with him before and don't want to have to run away from everything I care about. Last time it happened, my therapist said staying through the anxiety was better for me in the long term. However, I am concerned given this class will be a longer exposure.\n\nMy friend believes if I take the class, she or I should somehow warn him that I'll be there so that he doesn't get \"caught off guard\" and act out and trigger my anxiety. He once saw me in the same workplace as him and told the employer I was there stalking and harassing him - so I understand where she is coming from - but he also then had to admit to the employer he made it up. I tried to explain to her that I don't think anything I do or don't do can control his behavior, and how he acts is up to him. I also don't want to reach out to him given it's another avenue for him to manipulate me.\n\nI'd really like to take the class, not engage with him at all, and just bring headphones/books for breaks and find ways to focus on material and ignore him. I thought of asking some close friends to be available that week for supportive texts and checking in with my therapist over the phone. Does this seem like a decent plan?

I\u2019m starting to question if it is my fault, but once again know enough about manipulation in relationships (mother I\u2019m sure is a narcissist and perhaps a sociopath) to not assume full responsibility. I would love an opinion on this behavior on what to do.\n\nMy sister passed away in June of an overdose. It\u2019s suspected my mother was physically abusing her before the fatal dose, and it\u2019s been extremely hard to process. I found myself angry and crying most days, but had to continue with working. During this time my SO began an emotional affair with a model that frequents our dog park. They texted frequently, had meetups, went to yoga together, and one night he lied to me about going out with only \u201cguy friends\u201d as he met up with her secretly. Our roommate at the time came home without him at 1am, and my SO was not home. Upon asking, my roommate told me SO was walking the girl home, but that he should be home by now. Nearly 30 minutes passed, I called feeling like something odd was going on- and SO didn\u2019t  answer until the 3rd call. He rushed home, and lied immediately to my face. He said she was drunk and stumbling, and he was just being a good guy. We live in NYC and he could have gotten her in a cab, no need to go home with her. Then later after hours of taking, and him lying about the situation multiple times, he told me he did in fact go into her apt, then nothing happened. Then he told me after 3 or 4 fights AFTER this that she tried to kiss him. We have talked about this so many times I can\u2019t even remember, but every time the story changes. The biggest issue is he continued to see her \u201cby chance\u201d even though I asked him to end it. Then I caught her texting him one late night, and told her to back off (even after she told ME prior she was sorry and wanted to removed her from the issue.) Whenever he saw her, he told her everything was ok, further bating her to believe her actions were ok on his behalf and that their relationship of flirtation (and possibly more) was ok to continue. I explained to him he was allowing the cheating to happen, that tut was hurting me and the relationship, and that I wasn\u2019t ok with the friendship as emotional bonds were forming. He said it wasn\u2019t technically cheating so he shouldn\u2019t need to lose a friend, and continued to see her in secret. We faught many times after, me explaining that the relationship he was having with a woman outside ours was hurting me, especially during a time of mourning. He said my sadness drew him to do it. Weeks later after we finally found some resolve, another girl yet arose, this time in person with me. She was angry at him, obviously unaware he had a girlfriend (they had become friendly at the park and I\u2019m assuming she thought he was flirting or making advances, so rightfully so she should be upset to see him out with another woman) and I had to explain to him the difference between being friends with women, and presenting as someone open and available. I explained to him it hurts women\u2019s feelings when you flirt with them consistently without letting them you know you are in a relationship. I told him if he wanted to be in a monogamous relationship, flirting and relationships with women in this way was off the table for me, but also have always given him the option to have an open relationship. He\u2019s a \u201cconservative traditionalist\u201d aka he doesn\u2019t want it open but he wants to do whatever he thinks he should be able to do, despite how I feel it\u2019s hurting our commitment.\n\n He finally got it in a way, after months of talking, but jump to a couple months later...\n\nIt\u2019s now gotten to the point where we can\u2019t go a week without fighting. He says I\u2019m not taking care of myself, despite working 10 hour days, and finding time for therapy, yoga, and some self reflection. He says it\u2019s not enough, and as he is an undiagnosed orthorexic and obsessive about his body, I suspect it stems from the fact that I\u2019m a curvy girl but no way out of shape. He shames me at times, only is receptive on days where I\u2019m \u201cskinny\u201d (I suffer from occasional stress related bloating) and tells me he just worries about my health. I cook almost every night, and we are primarily plant based, but I live a full balanced life. If I have a glass or two of wine after a long week with dinner, he says I\u2019m abusing alcohol. But when he drinks it\u2019s not an issue at all. \n\nMore verbally, it\u2019s getting to the point where I can\u2019t even have an opinion on something, or when I tell him the way he\u2019s acting hurts my feelings, I\u2019m the abusive one. I work in a male dominated office, and often come home feeling degraded, unheard, and discriminated. My SO then tries to tell me I\u2019m using the experience at work as an unfair bias on how he\u2019s treating me, saying things like \u201cyou wouldn\u2019t feel this way if you didn\u2019t work with a bunch of men who treat you this way.\u201d He tells me my bias is based on my work experience, and any time I have an issue about our relationship or communication, it\u2019s not his fault - it\u2019s my problem and I\u2019m playing a victim.  But this isn\u2019t the case. He cuts me off, gets cold when he doesn\u2019t like the opinions I\u2019m sharing, and constantly degraded me. He says I don\u2019t take care of myself, and I know it\u2019s so much projection from his own insecurities about not being booked for roles lately.\n\nLast night was bad- we were at dinner, discussing a film. He kept cutting me off, and the energy was less of excitement and more of \u201cyou don\u2019t understand the story, your a woman.\u201d  After multiple times of asking him to let me talk, I snapped and sternly said \u201cLet me speak!\u201d. He immediately shut down, we got the check, and he stormed out of a busy restaurant without me. We walked home, but he was 10 steps ahead. When we got home finally, we discussed the night, and it turned into a fight. He then told me I was being verbally and emotionally abusive by having an opinion and not wanting to change. He compared me standing my ground to abuse of the same caliber as him cheating, and that \u201che changed for me so why can\u2019t I change for him\u201d. Here\u2019s the context of what happened in the fight (sorry for grammar, I was writing more detailed generalizations to share with my therapist):\n\n\nFor having an opinion I\u2019m told I\u2019m abusive.\n\nFor letting Him know I don\u2019t like to be cut off I\u2019m when we\u2019re taking, I\u2019m told I\u2019m abusive.\n\nHe says me sticking up for myself is abusive to him. \n\nSmall disagreements are blown out of porpotion and confabulated to be bigger issues then they are. Small things get turned into hour long fights and disrupt my sleep.\n\nHe continually goes to the past and brings up fights that we had months ago.\n\nHe creates physical space in the room, Will turn around, turn his back on me when I\u2019m speaking, but when he wants to get a point through will have an aggressive even lunging body language. I stand centered and calm. \n\nHe compares me asking him to not shut down during a conversation (a big issue) the same betrayal as when he cheated on me. He considers it the same kind of action and abuse from me. \n\n\u2014\n\nAm I the abuser for setting boundaries, knowing what I\u2019m comfortable with in my relationship, or having an opinion? Am I abusing this person, or am I being gaslit?", "subreddit": "emotionalabuse"}

If they could, they would long ago have changed into mature people. In fact, in my experience their behaviour tells you that they don't have respect for anyone or anything except their own immediate needs.\n\nSure, they can perceive when someone doesn't put up with their BS, so at a given moment they know \"what they can do and what they can't do\" to that person. If they didn't find an easier victim, that person can even be their current primary victim.\n\nIt never means that they respect a person and their boundaries though, in the sense that they would appreciate their value and leave them as they are. They \"respect\" a person and their boundaries like a toddler does: It's something that they perceive as standing between them and satisfying their desires. They will perpetually try to tear down the boundaries, the \"inner strength\" etc. of a person to get what they want.\n\nIs that respect? Not to me. Often, abusive people try to convince you that this is just how relationships are - a neverending fight where people prod each other to get what they want, and you constantly have to to be wary that you don't give too much to the other person. That is how \"strong people\" behave.\n\nTo (the biggest part of) me, having experienced much more mutual relationships with other more mature people including just friends and others, that is complete and utter nonsense. A \"prodding\" relationship like described above is one of a child to its parents. (Yeah, in a sense that relationship is abusive, in that the parent has to be selflessly catering to the ever-demanding child. Luckily, children are also cute and wonderful.)\n\nAnd in my experience, abusers really do have a weirdly childlike charm - in the sense that they really enjoy taking and taking and taking from you, and giving you back a shallow and short-lived appreciation of how \"good\" you are when you just did something for them. I believe that's actually one of the secrets to their intense sexual attractiveness (which in my case was the thing that made me tolerate a lot of otherwise really bad behaviour).\n\nThe thing is, toddlers grow up, quite quickly even, after just a few years; abusers don't.\n\nIn a relationship with an abuser - that is, a developmentally stunted person - you will forever be demanded to give up your self. For a few years in parenthood, it would be doable and children eventually \"give back\" so much more. An abuser though, who will never mature, won't ever give you anything more than these short highs when they tell you how good you are for supplying them, alternated with the emotional abuse of telling you how selfish and pathological you are when you do something for yourself/not immediately for them. It's a relationship that sucks you of your self, your resources, your energy, eventually your life.\n\nSo no, I believe no one thrives while they are with an abuser, and certainly not the abusers themselves.", "subreddit": "NarcissisticAbuse"}

Obviously that scared the shit out of me. So I sought legal advice... My attorney recommended filing immediately.\n\n    She's famous for moving too fast with low character men. Including secretly moving in w/my, at the time, two year old and an actively using heroin addict. And doing it all in secret... And not telling me where my child was.. and not letting me see me kid for four months, it was an absolute nightmare...and another time going to a foreign country to meet a 19yo drug dealer man she had only met on the internet and coming home a week later pregnant, he was living on the other side of the country. I hate to say it but thank God she lost it...too bad it was at month 4.5...i supported her through it...I was in the room when she delivered it and we watched it die together. It was sad as F. Idk, feel like I'm rambling. Just a little background I guess.\n \n    I was with her for 8 years and it was ugly...I stayed because I couldn't stand to leave my kids. I tried everything to get through to her. She abused all of us. It was constant insults, arguing, crazy disasters and requiring being pleased at all times or there was abuse...she smeared my name all over town every time I stood up for what was right in spite of her wishes, she called the police on me and told them I attacked her even though I couldn't walk without crutches at the time.

I have discussions to her by myself...it feels good to be able to say the things I want to say without the gaslighting or the personal insults derailing my point till our argument is absolutely pointless and only serves to hurt. Not sure that's thereputic either. \n     Honest reflection on my own actions is so natural to me, so easy. I FIRST question what I could've done different to avoid whatever it is.  WHY is it so difficult for them? She NEVER questions her own actions, it is always someone else's fault to her.  She could've saved our family so easily but she couldn't take that one simple step. Every time that door opened it ended up as crazy personal attacks on me and made up versions of reality...oh and her screaming deadbeat dad, faggot, junky etc in front of my sweet, undeserving children.  I will NEVER stop looking out for them and I will spend every dime I have doing it if need be.\n\n     I have to get the kids away from her ASAP. I'm positive she will try to move far away with my kids as the guy who's kid she's preggers with works on the west coast and I'm on the east. She already tried to move them away with him after only knowing the guy for two months max...idk exactly because it was all kept secret but I remember when she started going out of town and since then have pieced together a basic timeline. She talked on the computer for a couple of weeks and then took my kids to stay in hotels with him. It's crazy, I would NEVER take risks like that with them. They are already fighting and both drink/smoke pot and whatever other drugs they do.\n      \n She  is already cheating on him. I brought the kids home and some random guy was there and she was too happy to be straight...don't think it was booze but it was something. Also she's tried to have sex with me several times...she said she had permission kinda? From the guy she with now? Thats crazy. She asked me to be her \"second husband\" she had been reading polyandry stuff apparently. She also sent me nude photos about five time. I still don't know if I should tell her dude about it...I'd want to know, but how will that affect my children. Will it set off a crazy argument or is he a physical abuser etc?

Recently, I feel like a shit ton of repressed memories keep coming back up in my head, and for many of them, I immediately know them to have been real. But for a little while now I've had these lingering feelings (I wouldn't call them memories exactly, usually I can recall specific images and actions in my memories and these are more vague, but still enough to make me feel there's something to it) about something bad happening to me as a kid. I used to be babysat by my neighbor every day when I was like three until I was like six maybe, and I would play with their son who was a year older than me. I always remember him to be mean and violent and pushing me to do things I never wanted to, but that's not really what I'm struggling with. I keep having the overwhelming feeling that he would force me into sexual acts. Nothing wildly explicit, I don't think, but things that definitely I knew were wrong and left me feeling dirty, including taking off my clothes or touching him. The thing is, unlike all my other repressed memories that have come back, these ones are so so vague and not concrete that part of me thinks that I'm literally making it up out of nowhere and confusing his violent kid-like tendencies for abuse. I know he was a little kid too and probably didn't know it was wrong, but I just can't shake the feeling.  I should also add that, even though the idea of this having happened upsets me and makes me feel bad all over, I don't particularly think I've had any long-lasting emotional effects of it, which furthers my belief that maybe I'm conjuring it. I've had mental health problems throughout my life, including anxiety, depression, BDD, etc, but I always feel like I can pinpoint the traumas that contributed to those struggles, whereas I have no idea where this event, if it even is an event, fits in.

I am really scared of competing with others , I don't fight back, or stand up for myself.\nI sometimes think I am somebody else just when I need to talk and interact with people, cause I am peace of shit. who is worthless and doesn't mean anything to anybody. \nin school kids used to steal my stuff in front of me and I couldn't do anything to prevent them.and if I did I tell them please give me my stuff back. if they refused I would feel embarrassed because i am weak and that's my mistake.\nI always feel rejected and I am okay with that. and I actually feel more comfortable when I'm rejected than being cared about.i have 2 friends and I am not myself when I am with them, I pretend of being someone else when I hang out with them which i hate.\nmy mother punched, slapped, choked, belted me daily, like at least 3 times a day.\nSometimes I was able to run from her and sneak under the bed with my young sister, for sometimes it worked, but then she was able to carry the bed and move it while i was under it, I was just 5 years old. and then after that I never hid under the bed again because it was more horror than allowing her to hit me directly without running or hiding from her.\nI never tried to fight her back because she was so big and strong, she was a monster in my eyes. \nbut I thought I am the problem, I always felt like a burden and my existence is a mistake and I am the one who needs to deal with that.\nI always thought how it would be great if I just die.\nI didn't know how to read until I was 9 years old, when my mother teached me my lessons I used to memories how the words look and memorize how they are spelled.and if I do spell them wrong she would beat me so hard.she stopped teaching me when I became 9.and I still remember how I figured out how to read by my own and spell the words correctly without memorizing them I really was happy about it.\nI am still ashamed of myself because I couldn't protect my little sister when she was beaten she used to call my name when she was beaten. \nand when we where alone we would talk about how we will keep each other safe and have each other's back.\nI really couldn't do anything, I remember me yelling crying at mom please stop hitting her please stop!hit me instead. because my sister was seriously injured and I couldn't just keep looking. \nI still remember how my mother was tired after beating me and how she used to heavy breath after that.and so I remember my quick low breath. \nI still remember how me and my little sister used to look at each other while being beaten, I was like please little sister stop looking at me because i don't like to seem weak infront of you,I still remember how she looked frightened while I was beaten because she knew that all of this harmming will happen to her.\nwhen my father used to go to work in the morning we used to scream and shout really loudly sitting on stairs crying please dad come back please.\nWhen he used to come late at night from work we where happy and the moment we hear his footsteps we go run to him and oh god I still remember how I really felt safe with him.i loved that feeling when he was hugging me. he was my protector. \nwhen my mother used to hit us while dad is home we used to run to him and hide behind his back and he was able to stop the monster from beating us and he wipes off our tears with his big fingers. \nbut not for so long, she once talled us if you went to your father's back I will double your punishment and slay you.\nand that's what we did when she used to run towards us in front of dad we just stayed in our spots waiting for her to beat us.\nwhen my dad used to interfere we shouted loudly please dad stay away, but he never did, she used to start screaming and shout really really loudly when dad protects us from her, I still remember how we felt scared and pead our pants when that happens, we knew the next morning the moment our dad go to work we will be harmmed and destroyed really hard, because dad defended us yesterday. when she used to take us out for a restaurant or for an amusement park with her friends and their kids I never felt like I belong their, I don't deserve to be happy I am wothless and I don't need to be here, these kids are really waaay beter than me, I never tried to be happy because I know my life is miserable and I am always the kid who is a failure and a burden,  I got to act normal desbite that my mother's friends used to ask her why your kids don't play and look realy tired, they didn't know what was waiting for us at home. there was a teacher in the fourth grade who I thought she was beautiful and was really kind to me, I loved her and she loved me.i was a good student with her, I wished she was my mother, I actually remember myself imagining her being my mother, and when I go home she would hug me and when I sleep she would touch my hair and sing to me to sleep safely. not the sleep of the soldier in the middle of a war. my mother once came to our school and asked the teachers about me, there was another kid who's name is like mine, he was really noisy. that day she talled me she is going to come to school and ask about me. when I came home she was waiting for me. I was happy because I was a good student, I went to her and asked her :mother what did the teachers say?I was smiling, she slapped me so hardly on my face that my teeth bleed out. she continued hitting me telling me that there is a teacher (my lovely teacher) said bad things about you, I shouted during being beaten :\"it's the other kid its the other kid\". I really felt betrayed by everyone, that I am officially alone in this world. I never loved my teacher again. the physical abuse stopped when I was 13. The thing is I didn't remember anything about my childhood like nothing ever happened. until last month when I visited my parents and had to argue with my mother which made her really angry which lead her to slap me on the face, I kinda blacked out and didn't react to that at all, it's like I freezd or lagged. after 2 minutes I got out of the house not saying a word. then I started remembering things, and why I am the way I am, why I feel like shit and wortless, why I am scared of people. why I am comfortable with being rejected, why I hate compliments and don't know how to react to them,why I don't give my opinion on anything ,why I am so scared of standing up for my self or to fight back.i remember my abuse now. I imagined the 6 years version kid of me next to me in my bed and I hugged him telling him Don't worry I got your back now I am sorry for everything that happened to you, I whish I could go back and protect you, he really slept safely. little things about me now : I became an atheist at 18 and vegan at 21, never talled anyone about that because I am scared of them judging me, I talled you because no body knows me and I am still afraid of you judging me. I hope people become peaceful and stop harming each others and kids be happy. that's actually my only goal in life. peace among worlds.", "subreddit": "abuse"}

Dangerous to one\u2019s reputation, to one\u2019s well being and in some cases to one\u2019s life. Please know I do not mean to make light in any way of our situation.\n\nThis list is not a one size fits all by any means but I have noticed and been reminded in these threads that there are a few things that nearly always work against them - if you are in battle where you need to \u201cwin\u201d (at work for example) try these first before relinquishing whatever it is they intended to steal from you (time, money, your name, sense of self etc.)\n\n1. Happiness - As someone here recently mentioned, these people HATE happinesses. This is one of the easiest ways to expose the covert of you are feeling doubtful about someone. It\u2019s also one of the ways to *protect* and maintain something they are trying to steal from you. \n\nFor example, if you have one that is trying to waste your time and manipulate your schedule. Learn to privately and publicly adore your schedule. Do this and see how quickly the torture project is abandoned. \n\nHave a copycat NPD on your hands wearing all your favorite clothes? Continue to LOVE and enjoy clothes at least twice as hard as you did before in private and in public. Whatever they want to take - love that thing hard! It\u2019s incredible how easily this improves your life - really a treat to your own soul which may have been tampered with by them.\n\n2. Maintain certainty - the gaslighting wants you to be crazy so it\u2019s pivotal you remain sure. I\u2019m talking PdD-thesis-Scientific-fact level sure. Laziness here can help them ruin your life. Be certain even if things you are not actually sure about. Be self righteous, be correct! Use faith and trust in something you know for sure to create faith in trust where you are not quite sure. I cannot tell you how many times this saved my ass and WIPED out their agenda. It may take some time to see the results. Research Bach Flower Essence Cerato for an esoteric description of the kind of certainty I\u2019m talking about.\n\n3. Pull Rank. These people are almost always extremely elitist. It took me years to see this. I don\u2019t care if they are the poorest person you have ever met, they are elitist. They want to tear you \u201cdown\u201d from places and areas you didn\u2019t even know anyone thought was \u201csuperior.\u201d In order to \u201cwin\u201d here as a sensitive you have to do the very very very uncomfortable thing of pulling rank. Understand what they are after - is it your job title? Is it because you are the most loved? Is it because your church gave you the most responsibility? Is it because you went to a better school than them? Of everything I have mentioned so far I\u2019ve noticed this makes them the angriest and is the hardest for me personally to achieve Bc I just don\u2019t naturally care about these things. That said, excelling here was the difference between homelessness and thriving. I cannot overstate it. If they want you to feel unmarried and broke, befriend a married couple and enjoy it. If they want you to be fired, go volunteer for the highest ranking person in that field. Everywhere you are discredited by them, credit yourself!!! Be elite. Get a better job. Get a better title. Really push here Bc think about it, it will at minimum neutralize the downward force they are applying on your life.\n\nI have many other tactics that I won\u2019t bore you with. I want to end by saying I mean no disrespect to the more peaceful gray rock healing perspective. I\u2019ve seen people lose EVERYTHING to this monster of a personality type and barely escaped with my life myself. So if you are more inclined to fight, please do it. Please do NOT argue directly with them. Strategically and silently apply extreme force. Tell them nothing. Plan your exit strategy but don\u2019t let them erase you on the way.\n\nIf you have already left still apply these tactics to reclaim the parts of your life you may have lost in the fire.

Recently, I feel like a shit ton of repressed memories keep coming back up in my head, and for many of them, I immediately know them to have been real. But for a little while now I've had these lingering feelings (I wouldn't call them memories exactly, usually I can recall specific images and actions in my memories and these are more vague, but still enough to make me feel there's something to it) about something bad happening to me as a kid. I used to be babysat by my neighbor every day when I was like three until I was like six maybe, and I would play with their son who was a year older than me. I always remember him to be mean and violent and pushing me to do things I never wanted to, but that's not really what I'm struggling with. I keep having the overwhelming feeling that he would force me into sexual acts. Nothing wildly explicit, I don't think, but things that definitely I knew were wrong and left me feeling dirty, including taking off my clothes or touching him. The thing is, unlike all my other repressed memories that have come back, these ones are so so vague and not concrete that part of me thinks that I'm literally making it up out of nowhere and confusing his violent kid-like tendencies for abuse. I know he was a little kid too and probably didn't know it was wrong, but I just can't shake the feeling. I should also add that, even though the idea of this having happened upsets me and makes me feel bad all over, I don't particularly think I've had any long-lasting emotional effects of it, which furthers my belief that maybe I'm conjuring it. I've had mental health problems throughout my life, including anxiety, depression, BDD, etc, but I always feel like I can pinpoint the traumas that contributed to those struggles, whereas I have no idea where this event, if it even is an event, fits in. But still, I don't know, I just have this overwhelming feeling like something there happened, and I don't necessarily know how to figure it out or if I want to.

LTL FTP. I've spent a long time struggling to classify what happened to me in the past as abuse, and trying to come to terms with the effect it has on my life. I'm now is a super supportive LDR and hope to return to therapy in January.\n\nI was in a relationship for about two years with my ex. When it was good, it was amazing, but when it was bad... it got really, really bad. And about a year and a half was bad. There's a lot of detail there I don't want to go into, but a TL;DR is that he sexually assaulted me, verbally abused me, and gaslighted me into staying with him. I attempted no contact but relapsed a month later, getting stuck for another four months. I did things I'm not proud of out of fear and because he lied to me. He always painted it that no matter what happened, we'd always find each other again. When we were together, I found it romantic in a messed up way. but now it just feels like a guillotine hanging over my neck.\n\nI've done a lot of research trying to understanding why I, a reasonable and usually intelligent person, couldn't walk away from what was obviously a toxic situation. I've read about trauma bonding. I've made all the logical connections, and understand what was happening in my brain. I'm messed up from the whole thing and I'm not in denial about him anymore.\n\n It started because I thought I saw him walking around the store yesterday (home for the holidays) and spent the next five minutes ducking around aisles to avoid him while also trying to confirm if it was him (it was not). Last night I had a dream about good times with him in it, and in the dream I was happy. It's like my brain was looking at the guillotine and turning it into a diamond necklace, if that metaphor makes sense.\n\nI'm so fucking angry at myself. I'm angry at my brain. I don't love him, I don't want to be with him, I don't even want to see or contact him ever again. I am happy now, where I am, and who I am with. But my brain just decides, NOPE, let's throw you back into that horrible period in your life where you deadass considered driving into a lake because he'd stood you up for the eighth time with no contact as to why. That frame of mind was probably healthy, right? You were probably really happy then. And it's partially right, because sometimes I was happy, but it's all tainted now, and dreaming anything about the happiness just hurts.\n\nI just want him out of my head. I don't want the anxiety and depression he gave me, but sometimes it feels like my brain is more on his side than my own.  I just want to be okay now. I don't want to be fucked up anymore.\n\nThanks for reading", "subreddit": "survivorsofabuse"}

They are very confusing for me. I don't have any memory of assault and I'm very wary of fabricating a memory as an explanation for these panic attacks because I know memory is a fickle thing and I don't want to build a false memory of trauma for myself. \n\nBut they are reoccurring and inexplicable and genuinely very distressing and I don't understand why they happen. For example, one of the biggest ones I ever experienced was in the 9th grade. I wasn't sexually active then. My friend made a joke about me having sex with my girlfriend at the time and the moment he said it I just felt panic. Like, I couldn't hear a word he said after and I felt so fucking terrified and I had to like, pull myself back into being able to hear what he was saying but I just felt so dissociated and afraid. \n\nAnother example, I've been with my boyfriend for over a year and we're sexually active. Never in the act of like, doing anything with him did I ever feel panicked or scared. So like, actual sexual acts normally don't trigger a panic attack in the way certain conversations about it does. But then,there was a time he and I were discussing porn and he asked a lot of questions about if I masterbate or watch porn and kept on talking about sexual things and I felt the same panic happen again. \n\nBut the scariest one is sometimes when I'm jacking off (I'm a girl but I find this term more comfortable to use for masterbation idk why) the moment I start to feel actually good comes with this sharp wave of panic and I reflexively stop what I'm doing. It's as if it's physically painful. Today it distressed me so much I started crying the moment I stopped. This has happened multiple times but today was the worst it's been recently. \n\nThere are other similar examples but these are the ones that weigh on my mind the most. I have no evidence of abuse but something in the back of my mind wonders if something could have happened to me when I was young that I can't remember but that still effects me.

I waited a long time and missed so many red flags on the way there. But what's frustrating me now is the bureaucracy involved in him facing any consequences with the university. \n\nSo this guy comes from a rich and well-educated family. He held a well-respected job at the university that gave him power and recognition. He's also been fired from a job on campus for being inappropriate, been sanctioned for making female coworkers uncomfortable in another campus job, been investigated by the school before for abuse and rape, and he is on the school's threat watchlist. The investigation into him regarding his abuse of me has been going on since April and yet nothing has happened. Eventually they will finish and summarize their investigation then, once that's done, the disciplinary board will decide guilt on each conduct violation (8 of them, by the way. Ranging from IPV to rape to animal abuse). But as of now he's still going to school there and he's still living a fairly normal life while I had to move back home and have been struggling. I stupidly chose not to press criminal charges, and damn I regret that. \n\nI'm angry that he's escaped consequences so many times. He has done atrocious things and been caught but each time the university gives him another chance. And I'm afraid that they'll do it again. He's supposed to graduate with a master's this spring - what if they decide it isn't worth it to expel him now? I had my whole academic career derailed because of him but he's still fine. \n\nHe seems like a great guy on paper. Fuck he's even an Eagle Scout. But he's a dangerous and manipulative man. He weasels out of things because he's brilliant and has influence and he's left a trail of abused partners in his wake. Very few people know about any of his indiscretions - including the restraining order - so he just sleazes on by without a problem. It takes a lot of willpower not to write a small expos\u00e9 and submit it to the school paper. I want to tell people how many times the powers-that-be fucked up and let him go. I want people to know he isn't this brilliant social activist, he's a rapist and an abuser. \n\nI need to let this out because everyday I check my email for the completed investigation summary. And everyday, nothing. I've been in contact with the investigator. The first expected finish date was June. Then August. Then September. Now it's January. What am I going to do if they don't punish him? What if my depression gets worse and I give up? What if I rage and scream and publicly denounce him? People want me to move on but I can't yet. Not until he's been held at least somewhat accountable.\n\nAnd oh fuck am I angry at the Title IX adjustment that abolished the 60-day investigation mandate. I feel like I'm stuck on an endless hold and it's really pissing me off. Some people tell me that I did my best and should just accept that it's out of my hands. But that just makes me angrier because it basically means that he gets to do what he wants and I just have to let it happen. What kind of message is that? \"Sure come report your abuser, we'll figure it out in 2 months to 2 years, no worries!\"/s. \n\nIf anyone has any advice or anecdotes or anything I'd love to hear it.

I am already out of this relationship but I want to share it because this scares the hell out of me as a woman. \n\nThis is not about an obviously abusive man; many things were slow and subtle. It took me 6 months to see and many hours of talking to my dear friends to understand. But you know what? Sometimes I still wonder if I am the crazy one.\n\nLike many similar stories when I met him he seemed like an incredible gentle, smart, funny guy in his mid-30's. He is in general very kind to everyone and always always puts everyone else first - which I think ended up making him extremely resentful at work and at home, constantly seeking validation.\n\nWe worked and lived together. Everything was mixed - home conflicts were brought to work and vice-versa. During my first week of work we went out for dinner and upon him not stopping to talk about work I asked him if we could refrain from speaking about it after we leave the place or to set an hour from which we'd cease the work conversation. His response: 'I think it\u00b4s a good idea. You don\u00b4t have the structure for it.'\n\nAlthough this was the first red flag I can think of nowadays, at the time I was left wondering if I was a weak young woman who could not handle things properly.\n\nWe used to laugh a lot together and have good sex. That was the good part of it. He would be mostly very kind and sweet and very in love; but he would also interrupt me frequently while I was talking to say how beautiful I was and how much he loved my smile. I know it can sound cute but besides being annoying I felt that what I was saying as unimportant. \n\nAlthough I was going through a big transition (I just moved from living 5 years abroad to a city that was a bit familiar but had no friends there), he would constantly bring up how fragile I was and how he would take care of me.\n\nEarly on he would ask very personal and intimate questions about sex with previous men and ex-boyfriends. Although I don\u00b4t mind being open about it, I felt invaded inside and slightly uncomfortable.\n\nWhen it came to sexuality he never said anything nice about my body. This was the first time I'm having sex with someone who does not say a single word of how sexy / hot / great ass I am / have, whatever. But even before we got physical he mentioned how his ex-girlfriend was an eye catcher or something. In fact he talked about this girl a lot. In the latest weeks of our relationship he would bring her up daily for the most little unrelevant reasons. I was a bit upset one day about him complimenting a girl's ass (a neighbor in front was going around naked in her house) since he never said anything about mine. I was still acting cool about it but I told him it was a unnecessary thing to say. He agreed but also said \"but this is because you are insecure, I have noticed that since we first had sex\". Like this situation there wasn't much that he would not try to make it my responsibility.\n\nIf I talked to a colleague at work (specially if it was male) about something I haven\u00b4t yet talked to him, he would feel very upset about how I open up to other people and not to him. He talked about it for hours. I remember so many days when I wanted to go work early but he talked endlessly how I was sort of shutting him down of my life. He would also do this at night, talking until very late, like 2-3 am when I was extremely exhausted. He even made me feel guilty about our social media interaction before we actually met personally (we were linked by being in the same industry, that was all): \"you didn't even replied to my comments before, you never cared about me or my work.\"\n\nAt work he would interrupt me constantly, many times a day. But if a colleague would just jump in to say 'Hi' he would say: 'don\u00b4t you think he's here a lot?'\n\nHe would argue a lot at work. My job got extremely damaged by this. He would question all my being, my way of living, my past and I ended up not being able to think clearly and crying my eyes out in an anxiety attack where I literally felt I wanted to die. He would then say \"I'm here for you, I take care of you\", take me home to rest and later we would grab a nice dinner and be all love birds.\n\nBut from the start he showed he didn't trust me. \"I feel you are this kind of girl that is going to fuck a random guy in some club's restroom if one day we are really upset on each other\". And there I was crying and upset on MYSELF and not him because I led him to think I could be unfaithful, not thinking *he* was insecure. \n\nHe broke up with me twice to change his mind 2 minutes later. The last time it happened he yelled at me on the street, saying he deserved someone better, that he felt oppressed, I was selfish, and so on. This because just before I was telling a story of a former landlord I had who was behaving too invasive (typical lonely 60-year old dude who rents a room to young foreign girls and acts all weird) and he said \"well you must have done something for him to feel he could be flirtatious - all old men hit on you, so you must give them signs\". Even his male friend was shocked by this comment. After we left the bar I told him I felt constantly criticized by him and that made him nuts, hence all the embarrassing yelling. Once we got home he didn't want to believe I took the words \"this is over\" seriously and said *I didn't want to solve things* and that's how much *I cared* about the relationship, because *I chose* to listen to those words. We ended up talking (well... he did) until I fell asleep exhausted on the couch. I woke up in the middle of the night with him cuddling me. I never got to say a word on whether I wanted to continue the relationship or not.\n\nOne evening he was working with a client and start an argument with me over text; I was trying to calm it down once he was working and he needed to keep it up. The client apparently stressed a lot, got upset and stormed out. He came home to talk / argue some more and later throws at my face how he came home for me and for the relationship, whereas I was feeling psychologically tortured.\n\nHe would CONSTANTLY point out everything he did for me like I was some ungrateful dumbass that didn't do anything for the relationship and affirmed how lucky I was to have a guy like him in my life. But he would go around the main subjects of our conversations on various topics to have some sort of winning argument (even if we agreed - so there was really nothing to win or lose...) and would have a body posture that showed aggression, like standing up and leaning towards me.\n\nWhen I had an appointment (therapy to be specific - that I had to start because of my anxiety attacks) he would go into deep conversations while I was getting ready which made me very nervous I would not arrive on time. He refused to go into couples therapy that I started to suggest since we were having big fights once or twice a week.\n\nHe would \"feel abandoned\" if I came at work and didn't text him announcing my arrival even though I texted him on the way there or before I left home. If I went out to the grocery store to get some god damn cookies without telling him he would - again - feel abandoned and talk for **hours and hours** about it. But he would have his little private jokes with a female client (even if we were all together, leaving me out of the conversation)  and say something like \"she is so funny and we have been laughing a lot\" during a phase things were so bad between us we were not laughing as usual. When I confessed I felt sad about him saying that the response I had was that my feelings were about me not being able to make him laugh like before and not about the relationship...\n\nThere were many more episodes, even sex-related, that I can\u00b4t write in detail, but I ended up without personal and professional confidence, zero self-esteem, broken, questioning my entire being, having horrible anxiety attacks, actually researching ways to die without much pain, etc.. I really wanted to kill myself and it was a very dark place. As soon as I stayed with friends towards the end of our relationship (when we were having a break) that sort of anxiety never happened again.\n\nFor the people who reached so far in this huge text I want to add that I would have preferred that he would have been physical violent. Why? Because that would have been clear and I could just have left right away. But the way it happened it was pure emotional torture.\n\nI repeat advice from my therapist: if your gut feeling is telling you something, talk to someone you trust about this and don't ignore it. \n\nAnd please trust and know yourselves and put yourselves first and learn to set boundaries.\n\nI wish you all peace, love and courage.", "subreddit": "emotionalabuse"}

He then goes on to tell me about how she could be narcissistic as she rose to a position of power and eventually became the face of the cult. \nThis made me wonder whether narcissists can be nurturing after all? \nIn this context the way a cult works is to comfort people by providing people what they want and eventually control them. Much like narcissistic abuse. If these cults are supposed to represent a spiritual or social cause then the leaders have to pretend to be nurturing people and through exceptional grooming make their followers  believe that they are compassionate. The gain is cash or a perfect image of a philanthropist. \nMy question is , can narcissists really do this? Because to be nurturing you need to put someone else's needs above yours. So will a narcissist be able to do that just to put up a show of being a philanthropist/motherly figure? If so how can you differentiate such a person from someone who is genuinely empathic?", "subreddit": "NarcissisticAbuse"}

My ex had convinced me other people would not understand me like he could, would get jealous ( I guess?)

I felt like I couldn't communicate with my current friends or my close family for fear of being judged for the way my relationship was. It just seemed easier to me to disappear. I always thought once things got better with my ex I would be able to rejoin society and I always held on to that notion. Once he stops drinking, finds a job that doesn't stress him out so much, settles his debts, we move in together, his son goes off to college etc etc etc THEN everything will be okay again and I can lead a 'normal' life. Those things never happened and the more I tried and pressed to make things better the angrier he got and it wasn't  long after he started hitting me that I removed myself from the situation for good. I'm lucky, I know; it doesn't always end that way. I've been out of that relationship for over a year. \nI've made a lot of progress. I left my job that I clung to because it was the most stable thing in my life even though I was never happy there. I went back to school, entered a new career and am in a really great relationship. However I REALLY struggle with making friends and putting myself out there. I hid my life for fear of judgment as well as fear of fighting with my ex over it. I can't seem to connect with people in person because I'm afraid my now 7 year absence from the social world looks to people. Why is it so weird to make friends when you dont already have some?

More than ten years ago, my cousin sexually assaulted me when I was 12 years old during a family reunion. We basically grew up together, being just one year apart. His mom - my godmother - was always incredibly close to me. Closer than my own mum and me ever were. I trusted her explicitely, stayed over for weeks, etc. I never told anyone about the sexual assault because I didn't quite understand what had happened - why a person that was basically a brother to me suddenly did something that made me feel the way it did. I was a kid and deep down in my own confusion it never occured to me to tell anyone. I ignored the whole thing for the next decade, albeit avoiding said cousin whenever I was in town.\n\nThis year I went to see my aunt and noticed I got increasingly angry over the days I stayed with her. My cousin, who basically still lives with her, was very present at that time. I thought about telling him what a shitty thing it was he did to me back then and how it made me furious still. I couldn't do it to his face. A couple days later, I did what the average Generation X young adult would do: write a text message. I confronted him with what he did in a mature tone and told him I didn't want anything from him but just needed to speak (text) it out loud to acknowledge and maybe move on from the whole thing. He sent me a voice mail, saying he didn't remember any of it yet he apologized.\n\nOne hour later my beloved aunt started bombarding me with text messages. She called me a liar, accused me of making the whole thing up and threatened to sue me for defamation. She also implied I was a slut as I danced with a guy during a party that happened the weekend I stayed with her. The whole thing was extremely violent and I ended up blocking her to give myself a break. The next day she called my dad, urging him to make me apologize for what I said (...yep). As far as I know, the whole family (four aunts) were informed that I am an ungrateful little sh\\*\\* that makes up lies. Needless to say, I was heartbroken and angry. I'd wanted to keep the sexual assault thing between me and my cousin only, and now I feel like I've lost the one person in my family that I genuinely liked.\n\nThis week, six months later, my aunt sent me a Christmas card. Her birthday is tomorrow. My mum (who has been very supportive during the whole ordeal) told me she avoids the whole subject when speaking to her, yet when she mentioned it one time my aunt's opinion on the issue had not changed. A couple months ago she even texted me telling me \"she now would be ready to let it go\". I didn't answer that text, as I feel like I myself needed to be ready to let it go and not her. Basically, I want the apology I know I am never going to hear. I feel betrayed and feel like I could never trust her again, but also, I miss her so much.

We were in love and we went out on cute dates and we would send each other cute messages every day. She would tell me how excited she was for the future with me. We talked about marriage and kids. She was also going to therapy for the first 6 months and so was i but the summer came around and we both had to stop. Things on both our ends got ugly. Our personal lives were both bad and we would see each other relatively every day. \n\nThis is where problems began. She started to tell me that I wasn\u2019t there for her and that I didn\u2019t know how to communicate with her. I started to feel very insecure about certain people in her life who she would endlessly praise for what I thought were tiny things. She always made me feel like what I was doing for her wasn\u2019t enough, despite me feeling totally drained from trying to keep her happy all the time. She would tell me that the way I loved was not her way and that I didn\u2019t understand how to love her. That we weren\u2019t compatible and completely different people. It seemed like these thoughts had come out of nowhere. She told me that me talking about my insecurities is what got her to think about the bad things about me. I never understood that. \n\nBasically, I always found myself apologizing for the arguments we would have because everything turned out to be my fault. I was always at fault for something. She rarely apologized if ever. And her apologies always came off like \u201cI\u2019m sorry I made you feel that way but I did it because...\u201d and it never sat well with me. She always told me that I made everything about myself and that I never validated her but there were times I felt like I was the only one listening. But I accepted what she told me because I cared about her feelings. \n\nThere is so much more but it ended with an unclear breakup. She told me that she couldn\u2019t be with me anymore but she was still coming to my house and sleeping with me. She was still talking about us \u201cbeing involved\u201d without a title. After that, it was 3 months of endless arguments. Any little thing I did would upset her. She would get so angry she would curse and scream and when I would tell her she would tell me she wasn\u2019t yelling and that I hadn\u2019t heard her yell for real. I was always very scared and I felt like I was walking on eggshells around her. Anything I did or said could set her off. It felt like she was finding anything and everything to be mad at me for. \n\nOnce the 3 months were over she started talking to this guy from her past that was always an issue for me. I never liked him because the relationship they had was never clear and he had drunk texted her compliments while we were together and I always felt like he had disregarded and disrespected the relationship. She didn\u2019t even tell me about it until the morning after. He made me extremely uncomfortable and she just made excuses for his actions saying that they were just friends. They were best friends at some point but she had feelings for him then. They went years without talking but they would still meet up. They got close again and she FT to tell me how she met up with him for dinner and drinks. She made comments about how he validated her and I lost it. I was so hurt because it seemed like she was rubbing it in my face. She then made it seem like I was the crazy one for how I reacted and told me she had to stop talking to me. \n\nThat wasn\u2019t the worst of it. She brought him to an event I was at a week later and claimed she didn\u2019t have anyone else to bring. At the event I had to deal with her being super affectionate with him the entire time and I had to bite my tongue. That was the final straw for me. I told her I was removing her from all social media and called it quits. She wanted to continue a conversation about him and claimed she didn\u2019t \u201crecall\u201d the affectionate moments. I didn\u2019t want to so I stopped there. A week later I couldn\u2019t take it anymore and spoke to her on the phone about him and everything in the relationship. She told me that I was the emotionally abusive one and that the relationship was toxic and that she had to get out. She also told me how the conversation with him flows and that he understands her and how he does for her what I never did and basically rubbed in my face how much better he was for her than I was. I was in pain. Pain I had never felt before and her apology seemed so half assed and not genuine. \n\nI just feel like I tried so hard for someone who is now devaluing everything we had just because she has this dude in her life now who is supposedly doing all these things for her but she somehow conveniently forgot everything I did for her. Its not different from anything he\u2019s doing. She\u2019s choosing to only focus on the bad and comparing that to him. And it\u2019s unfair.

Today marks one year of the affair being confirmed and December 28th will mark one year no contact. For those that are just discovering the world of narcissists (as I was last year), I am telling you, it DOES get better. I remember reading a post last year where someone said that same thing and I scoffed thinking, there\u2019s no way. I can hardly take the next breath. I thought, you have no idea of the pain. It felt like a shot gun had gone through my heart at point blank. I won\u2019t lie, the first few months of discovery and coming out of it are HARD. BUT it does get better. A year later and I am still standing, still breathing, and even experiencing some joy in my life again. While I still have a good amount to go on my healing journey, when I look at where I am today vs. a year ago, it\u2019s a mammoth difference. \n\nOne of the things I have learned in my healing that I think is so helpful, is the knowledge that a narc\u2019s patterns will ALWAYS prevail and there will always have to be an issue for them to fixate on. In fact, 99% of the time, THEY create the \u201cissue\u201d and will act as the victim. It doesn\u2019t matter who they are with, where they are in life, what job they are in, their pattern will always prevail. I\u2019m not sure if the nex husband is still with the supply he left me for (and I honestly don\u2019t care), but i do know he is looking for another job. The only reason I know this is because of a reference that was called. The nex moved from job to job when we were together (and always blamed toxic work environments). Well, after the discard I discovered that he was the issue at his \u201ctoxic jobs\u201d.  So, to hear that he is now looking to move to a different job after only being at it for not even a year a half, was complete and total validation that the pattern is prevailing and all of his other toxic patterns will follow in suit. He hasn\u2019t changed. It wasn\u2019t me that was the issue. And if he\u2019s looking for another job, well whatever supply he has will soon be discarded too, just as he did with me. \n\nSo if you\u2019re doubting whether you have experienced a narcissist and their abuse, the fact that you\u2019re on this page is most likely a giant yes. If you\u2019ve researched and read people\u2019s stories and they make sense, it\u2019s another yes. Narcs and their abuse should NOT make sense. And if you\u2019re wondering if the nex that was in your life is happier with the new supply or if they have changed, they haven\u2019t. The moment a new supply is secured, the devalue beings. It\u2019s like driving a new car of a car lot, there is immediate depreciation in the value of the car. Sooner or later,  their pattern will ALWAYS prevail in every single aspect of their life. They will never change, they will continue on in their cycle of destruction, but YOU will not. You will heal, you will move on and you will be okay.

That is most of the info that might be helpful.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSince last summer my step-dad got more horrible then he usually is he got mad at every little thing i did wrong, say i dropped something and had my hands full he would make me throw everything i had in my hands down and make me clean the whole floor and then say that i was useless at times. He would never listen to me if i ever had something to point out he did wrong would just say that i'm back talking and then i would lose the ability to do something like watch tv or play on the computer not he worst but was to extreme for something pointless. One time i was hanging out with some friends after a stupid school dance that i told him about and yelled at me through the phone because i didn't sweep the floor before he got home. He expected everything to be perfect before he got home from work, kitchen clean, dishes done, floor swept, dinner done. if something was imperfect he would yell at us and say we are unable to do anything ourselves. Some days when my mom came home from work very tired my step dad would come up to me and talk to me saying that we need to do the kitchen so my mom doesn't have to as if me and my brother didn't do it almost daily. at eh start of the school year he would come home more tired and i would have to make dinner and feed my half sister dinner and then deal with my step-brother who always fights me for all attention to be on him. It got so bad that i became suicidal and still kinda am i've done some self harm i have gotten help and am on anti-depressants. it would have gotten worse if one of my friends didn't report me to one of the school counselors. And my mom has told me that she wants to get a divorce but has left it up to me to make the final decision, i do want them to get a divorce and am planning on telling her after the holidays so it's not as stressful. Another thing is my aunt was kicked out of our house because she was smoking pot(I don't care but it was around children so absolutely not and i'm in utah so it's illegal)  And then my step dad's ex wife moved in and we had to move and pack all of her shit and i had to move out of my room and move in to the office still with shit in it. And then after all this i moved in with my grandparents. It has gotten better but i still struggle with  the memories of constantly being yelled at and have been more secluded then normal cause there is not the constant need of him wanting me right next to him almost like a slave.

We had the talk and he acted like he cared, while fiercely defending his boyfriend and refusing to admit he is anything less than perfect. He offered to start hanging out with me without the boyfriend around - but only doing very specific activities that the boyfriend wouldn't insist on joining us. Initially I was happy that we came out of the conversation with a plan and still being friends, but the more I have thought about it, the more I have realized the friendship is over. I brought up many situations where I felt that I was treated like absolute garbage because of his boyfriend controlling the situation. He found a way to manipulate every single situation in order to take the blame off of his boyfriend, including giving multiple excuses that often contradicted one another, or blatantly lying about the arrangements that we had made, including when there was written proof of our arrangements on WhatsApp. That was 2 months ago and we have not seen each other since (we used to see each other every few weeks). We have barely spoken since, but I am finding that I actually have no desire to see or speak to him, since he fed me so much bullshit when I tried to have an open and honest conversation about saving our friendship and spending more quality time together. I feel like there is now this huge gaping hole between us because I can no longer believe a single word that comes out of his mouth. \n\nNow every time I go on Facebook, I see that all of the Christmas traditions that he used to have with us (inviting all of his friends over for a holiday brunch mid-December, inviting the close friends over for Christmas dinner on or around Christmas) are now being done for the boyfriend's friends instead of his own. I know that I should stop following the boyfriend on Facebook cause it just makes me feel like shit, but at the same time I feel like it's the only way to have any idea what is going on in my friend's life. \n\nAnyways, I think I am finally accepting that as long as this guy is in his life, there is no room for me. And that just makes me sad. I don't know if giving up makes me a bad person/friend, but I am tired of being treated like shit and feeling rejected all of the time. I realize that my friend is the victim here, but if I can't do anything to help him realize that, I think I just need to step back and hope that he will realize it himself (or that the narc moves on to his next victim). \n\nJust needed to get that off my chest.

I apologize dearly in advance for the long read. Some backstory, I was dating a woman for about 2 months and it got serious very quickly. Even though we were head over heels for each other, we were fighting almost constantly. \n\nOver the course of the 2 months, I made the mistake of shouldering the blame for a lot of the problems we were having. From the very beginning, she always wanted to spend lots of time with me and I am someone who needs to frequently take time for myself to decompress. She would take my reluctance to spend almost every free day we had together as evidence that I didn't really like her. In the first week of our relationship, she told me that it made her feel really bad that I had a free day (that I had spent alone at home) and chose not to come to see her, after having spent 3 straight days together. The idea that \"I didn't like her\" came up a lot in our relationship and unfortunately it made me stretch myself thin just trying to convince her otherwise. \n\nI joke around a lot and I would often have to spend the whole day apologizing for a joke I made because she would connect it to insecurities she had. I still don't fully know if my jokes were truly hurtful or just innocuous (something I am currently unpacking in therapy). \n\nI do know now though, how wrong it was when I would feel uncomfortable or upset by something she said and she would respond by pouting and saying \"I didn't mean it like that\"  when I would bring it up to her. Her responses to my concerns about our relationship made it jarringly difficult to be heard in our relationship and I would eventually end up feeling unheard and constantly remorseful. \n\nI also had a different way of showing affection from her, and she would often outright say that my way wasn't valid. She would often tell me to just break up with her since I obviously didn't like her. She would also lash out at me for having a good time with my friends or just generally try to force her way into my friendship circle (something I was not comfortable with). \n\nShe also spent about a month and a half convincing me she had an extreme phobia of ducks, to the point where she would whimper at the mention of the word \"duck\", only to reveal later it had been a \"prank\". \n\nI gave her a lot of space and tried my best to get her into therapy several times but eventually, I realized I couldn't stay in the relationship anymore. I consulted with my friends a lot and tried to see things from a different point of view but it seemed the consensus was a clean break.\n\nDuring and after the breakup I made it clear I was more than open to being friends and helping her on her mental health journey. She communicated, initially, that she was open to being friends but would need some space (which I was happy to give her). Eventually, after a month of radio silence, she messaged me that she didn't think we could be friends because she realized that a lot of my behavior during our relationship was emotionally abusive and manipulative. I respectfully disagreed and we parted politely. \n\nWhich brings us to the last 3 months. After she told me she thought I had been emotionally abusive, I spiraled a bit and had a bit of an identity crisis. I've been in therapy for the last 6 or so years trying to deal with my depression and anxiety, and suddenly I had something else to be catastrophically anxious and depressed about.\n\nI spent the first month convinced I was secretly cruel and manipulative, that all the progress I had made to try and become a good, more whole person was fake, and that eventually my loved ones would see me for who I am and abandon me. My friends did their best to reassure me and talk to me when they could. I increased my therapy sessions to 2 times a week, and started to unpack the relationship and my role in it.\n\nIt got worse before it got better. I ended up cutting off contact with my friends and most people for a month, out of fear I was going to hurt someone emotionally. I did my best to take the time to focus on hobbies and working on my self. The month away, surprisingly, really helped me to clear my head and get a better grasp of my identity.\n\nThis month, I've accomplished a lot. I have only had one major panic attack and I have a much firmer grasp on my identity than I did 2 months ago (though I still do lapse pretty frequently). I haven't started dating again quite yet, I'm focusing on my job and my loved ones for the time being but I am hopeful for 2020. \n\nMy highest points are so high but when I'm low it feels like I'll be low forever. Is there anyone who has gone through something similar and has gotten through it? Is anyone still going through it? I would love to hear from your experiences and how you dealt/are dealing with it.

Here are some things that have happened since I last posted in this sub:\n\nStarted thinking about the ex less and less. He hasn't tried to hoover me since his last attempt a few weeks back. If he does try, I feel strong enough to resist it.\n\nBegan seeing two new people very casually. Guy #1 is easy to get along with &amp; talk to and we have a lot of fun together. Guy #2 is a bit more private/mysterious but cute and exciting. Normally #1 would be more my type as I tend to gravitate towards people who are more open and talkative and calm. But I think maybe being around my nex changed something because the quiet chaos of #2 was a lot more attractive to me. Some things I noticed didn't sit right with me though.\n\n1. For someone I'd only been seeing for two weeks, he wanted too much of my time and attention.\n2. While we texted, I was sitting down excitedly awaiting his replies when I could've been doing literally anything else.\n3. Some of our conversations left me confused and I found myself thinking back to what happened and making an effort to try to understand.\n4. Walking home after both of the dates we went on, I noticed I was feeling drained.\n\nSo I just let him go. Told him I didn't want to see him again. He was confused and a little upset. I felt relieved, which says a lot tbh. I went out with guy #1 since then and it was so natural and effortless that it cemented my belief that something really was up with the other guy. I don't know if it's narcissism or not and I don't really care. My mental energy is more important than some guy.\n\nI might have gotten addicted to my nex and how confusing and exciting it was to be with him. I might gravitate towards similar relationships because of that addiction. But at the end I still have all the control and I can make the right choices.", "subreddit": "NarcissisticAbuse"}

We've gotten to know each other very well and are very honest with each other. Who we know, who we talk to, what we do when we're apart. It's something that truly solidifies our relationship. I have no worries about her cheating or committing a crime or anything like that, so I just want to take that out of the conversation. She is perfect with her kid, a loving mother, a beautiful partner, and a genuinely good person. None of what follows has tainted her.\n\nK has lived a life of abuse. When she was a child, her father abused her emotionally, beating up her brother, beating up her dogs, mental games. He would beat her mother and treated them all like shit. He kidnapped her at a young age and she only got back to her mom in her late teens. She hasn't talked to him in 20 years.\n\nHer brother took up the mantle and started to beat the shit out of her when she was a kid. Legitimately breaking bones, causing injury. Now that they're grown, he has targeted his kid, who she tells me he hits and screams at as a means of \"correction.\" To the point that people at parks yell at him to stop and he tells them to mind their own business as he beats his daughter's hindquarters raw. She has also told me he is guilty of straight-up robbery from his younger years. She told me they have no relationship except for her mother trying to keep them in contact through her, so they meet up for holidays and birthdays and the like. Otherwise nothing.\n\nShe and I are both divorced, each of us with a kid from our previous marriage. She told me she split with her ex due to his mental abuse. I'm unclear if there was physical abuse, but I don't believe so. He would belittle her, gaslight her, try to make her feel worthless. He cheated on her when they first started dating, which resulted in a child, then she got back together with him a few years later, which resulted in their marriage and a child. She told me she cried before her wedding because she knew she was making a mistake. Now, they have a relatively cordial relationship after years of splitting up, joking with each other and the like. In our time together, he's asked if she would come over to watch a movie. I haven't had the guts to ask if she hooked up with him after their divorce because I think that would be the end for me.\n\nShe was divorced for 3 years. In that time, she tells me there was one guy who she wanted a true relationship with, all the rest were complete assholes and in some cases, abusers as well. One going so far as to commit what I can only call rape. When we became friends before dating, she was in regular contact with several of these exes. Chatting through daily texting, going on playdates with each other's kids, meeting for drinks, doing stuff at their houses. She's told me all of these guys were assholes but kept a regular relationship with many of them. About a month into our relationship I told her I was uncomfortable knowing she was still in a good relationship with guys she told me she thought were jerks and assholes and I would be more comfortable if we both just cut ties with previous relationships. She said no problem and we both did, but it's bothered me that she was so comfortable staying connected with these people, calling them her friends.\n\nAll of this has bothered me. I have a child of my own and I'll be damned if I'm going to willingly place him in the company of abusers and criminals. Up until now, I haven't felt any issue. Her brother was at an arms-length, she had no contact with her father, these guys were nothing to her, etc. But some events in the last couple of weeks have me questioning things.\n\nShe's been on work training out of town for the last couple of weeks. A year ago, K had a fling with a guy at work that didn't work out. She ended things after getting weird vibes. He went batshit and started telling people they'd slept together, saying how good of a lay she was, and tearing her to shreds in conversations saying she hurt him badly, how could she do this to him, of course he reacted this way because of what she'd done to him. He did this in person at a lunch he asked K to go to, putting all the blame on her for how he was acting. Textbook narcissistic rage. Well, during this work training, she tells me they sat in a hot tub together, gabbed about pop culture, and then stayed there until everyone had left and they talked about what happened. I was shocked. I couldn't believe she was giving this guy the time of day, much less sitting around having a friendly conversation. She has even excused his behavior, saying \"that's just how normal guys react, is what it is.\"\n\nThen the big stuff happened. While out of town, she decided to reconnect with her dad. He wanted to see her cuz she happened to be training in the same city he lives in. Her half-sister asked her if she'd meet with him and she said yes. In my mind, this guy is a complete piece of shit. He will never meet my child. And here she is, now that we're together, rekindling a 20-year split. She said she wanted him to see how well she's done without him, that she's in a good place and is ready for it. I just can't understand it and will honestly have a problem if he is coming into her life with my kid in the picture.\n\nWell, she asked me how I felt after meeting her dad and her half-siblings (I was there) and I was honest, I have a pre-conceived image of this guy and I wasn't giving him a lot of chance. I know what he did so the frail, sad old man before me didn't conjure a good image. I then told her he would not be meeting my kid, and for that matter, neither would her brother. When we met, K had told me they barely had a relationship and that made things okay because I could just keep my son out of those small interactions. I said I will never expose my son to an abuser and that's that. She was taken aback and offended. I told her it was taking everything I had not to call CPS on her brother and that's when she got mad, told me I had no right to do such a thing and if he ever got to the point that his actions deserved CPS, she would do it herself. We left it at that.\n\nI'm honestly feeling like this is not a situation I want my son to be in and frankly, I don't want to be in it either. I know she's been in a lifetime of abuse so to her, it's like a scale. Well, he slut-shamed me, but at least he didn't hit me. Well, he's spanking her really hard but at least he's not leaving permanent damage. From my background, there are people who abuse and people who don't abuse. There's no scale. People who beat children deserve to die in a fire and I don't have the capacity to give them the time of day. I thought I would never be seeing these people and I love K with all my heart, but if she's been so damaged by the abuse over the years that she's okay with this stuff, I don't think I can be with someone like that. It makes me feel like I'm abandoning a damaged soul, but I have to think about my kid. He has no choice in the matter, and I won't put him in that position, period.\n\nThe question I have is: is this normal? Do victims of such life long abuse just live with it? She claims it's a coping mechanism, that she just chooses not to think about it. But why connect with these people then? Why willingly stay in contact. That seems the best way to not think about it. I don't know what to do. I love her, I love her kid, and she loves mine. But this feels like an insurmountable obstacle. It feels like our relationship has made her feel strong enough to face these demons but I don't want them around at all! By being in an amazing relationship, I've opened the door to let these monsters in. I don't know what to do.\n\ntl;dr My partner comes from a life of abuse and recently, appears to be letting these abusers back in her life now that she feels like she's in a strong place in life. I don't want these people in my life and I worry she's only doing this because our relationship finally makes her feel stable. It feels like a catch 22.", "subreddit": "survivorsofabuse"}

He had been trying for 3 months to reconnect but I went no contact. I can usually only have him in my life for more than 2 weeks at a time. \n\nThis time, he was different. Ive never had the typical Hoover/honeymoon phase. He hoovers by guilt tripping; it\u2019s highly effective on me. He\u2019s your typical angry white man. He listened and did the things I asked him to, so I got him a Christmas present. 10 days ago I asked to make plans to see him last week (he\u2019s going away Christmas Day) and we are both divorced and have kids (not married to each other).\n\nAvoid, avoid, avoid. \n\nThen last Thursday he called and we had a 2 hour talk, we agreed to see each other the next morning. He said he would text when he woke up. He didn\u2019t. I texted him...told me he was on his way to help his friend remove an engine. I was like.. oh, we had plans. He said I would do the same and go help out a friend and \u201cwow, thanks for being understanding\u201d...  and \u201cSorry, I didn\u2019t know for sure if you wanted to see me\u201d.\n\nI texted him the next morning and I said \u201cI need you to fix this or to never contact me again, ever. Go away, stay away.\u201d I can\u2019t block his calls because he has a cloaked cop phone. I\u2019m great at never contacting him.\n\nAnyway, he asked how can he fix it... and I said take ownership and then put some effort into this. He said \u201cI did apologize\u201d. I said \u201cyou blamed your actions on me... that\u2019s not an apology.\u201d\n\nSo, I let it go, because he asked how he could fix it, and wanted to see if he did. He didn\u2019t. He made plans to see everyone else but me before he leaves. Yesterday he texted me and said \u201cI can see you tonight... oh wait, no I can\u2019t. I\u2019m going out for a drink with my buddy, but he may cancel, I\u2019ll let you know\u201d.\n\nI refused, I told him exactly what he could do with his shitty invitation and that since he cant make the effort to see me before 2020, he will not be seeing me in 2020.\n\nHe told me to F off, he\u2019s done with me, never to contact him ever again. I said, \u201cwell as I stated in my last text, that was my plan, but if your fragile ego needs to frame it so that you\u2019re the one who left, have at it.\u201d\n\nI wished him merry Christmas, happy new year and told him all I wanted was to see him. \n\n4 hours later he started blowing up my phone. He texted \u201cI can\u2019t believe you are saying I blew you off when we never had plans... you\u2019re psycho.\u201d When I didn\u2019t reply, he called twice. I didn\u2019t answer.

We have been a couple for two years now, overall its wonderful, but this has become a real problem in the last year.\n\nHe has a really short fuse and I just don't know what to do about it. It seems like the littlest things tick him off. For example, last week we went to his office Christmas party. For the whole week before, he kept talking about how excited he is to see me in \"full make up looking pretty for me\". Well I put make up on, but didn't wear lipstick because I wore intense eye make up and it would have been too much to wear both. He went *ballistic.* He said that I never make an effort to look pretty for him and dragged me to sephora to buy me a lipstick right there and then so I could put it on before going to the party. I tried to explain to him why I didn't wear it, but he wasn't having it. When we got to the mall and the sephora was already closed, he punched a wall because he was so angry.\n\nHe's a great guy otherwise and he takes care of me, but it seems like everything has to be on his terms. He told me I can't go to university in a different state so now I'm staying close to home and he bought me a Kate Spade purse as a thank you, but he yells at me whenever I go out without it. He got upset two weeks ago when he had a day off and wanted me to come over to have sex, but I couldn't because I had to study for my exam. He yelled again and was like \"can't you just come over for half an hour to do this for me?\"\n\nHe's also cheap... he buys me things I don't want because he has a really good job in business consulting, but also is extremely stingy when we go out.

I tried to tell him that I want to travel, do other things, etc... he won't have it. He yells at me at every opportunity. He buys me expensive shit I don't want but gets upset when I ask for little things, like a cup of tea from Starbucks.\n\nI do love him though..

What can I do?", "author": "nelyts", "self_text": "One of my friends started to invite his girlfriend to join our friend group when we study/drink/grab food/hangout after us pushing for him to include her. Over time she became someone who regularly hangs out with us and an accepted part of the group. We love her, she's kind and funny and cool, but also extremely shy and sensitive. As a group, we do not make fun of each other or put each other down. We simply joke and laugh and share the same interests so it flows pretty smoothly regularly.\n\nHowever, since his girlfriend began hanging out with us, I've noticed that her boyfriend (our friend) doesn't treat her with the same level of enthusiasm or respect as he would normally treat us. He is a pretty cool guy and pretty friendly with us. With her, he tends to cross the line when it comes to jokes vs insults. He will make jokes that are simply a dig at her but they (very obviously) aren't funny. I think he does it to make us laugh or something. We don't laugh. When she tries to talk about something, he tends to find a way to shut her down or ridicule her for what she said. We do not feed into this behaviour because we can tell it bothers her, and its also bothering us. He makes snide remarks about her under his breath. He tends to reject most physical advances she tries to pull (putting a head on his shoulder, etc) and overall just seems extremely rude and dismissive of her and her feelings. He always says he's \"joking\" when she does (if ever) try to stand up for herself or seems obviously upset. He also seems to try to find his way out of any plans she tries to make with him, and he calls her names regularly (stupid, idiot, etc). Everything he says \"one-off\" could be explained away by saying it's a joke, but at this point it's gone too far. We can all tell this upsets her. She zones out, looks upset, or just goes completely silent in group settings. I can tell how her mood changes from beginning to hangout with him, to the end. He doesn't at all seem to acknowledge it. It's upsetting to see.\n\nThey've been together almost two years now and this behaviour has seemed pretty consistent. She seems to really really like him, so I feel like she is trying to ignore the way he treats her, or is upset by it but has given up trying to stand up for herself. I would like more than anything to be able to talk to her about this, but I haven't felt confident or close enough with her and would have no idea where to start. My friends and I have all noticed this behaviour and all agree that something should be done, but we really do not know what we should do.\n\nThis same friend has also started to treat our other friend (his roommate) in a similar fashion. I have a feeling he acts this way because we are in a group setting. As if he's showing off or something, but none of us encourage it and we all have tried to shut it down subtly. It seems to be something he does with people who are closer to him/he's more comfortable with/won't really stand up for themselves.\n\nWe are in college and unfortunately the boys will be living with each other this upcoming semester so we can't really cut him out. I want to remain friends with his girlfriend and our friend but this situation is tough.\n\nOur friend seems to respect our opinions and seems interested in self-improvement so I would hope he would be open to advice, and perhaps doesn't see the fault in his actions but we have never talked about relationship-related stuff before, so there is no way to tell whether or not he will react poorly. This also may be crossing a weird boundary because he rarely brings her or their relationship up.\n\nObviously what we have been doing is not enough - because not feeding into it doesn't stop it entirely. His actions show he does not really care for her yet they are still together. What can we do or say in this situation to try to help or maybe push it in a better direction? Who should we talk to first? Sitting around and doing nothing makes me feel partially responsible for allowing this behaviour. It is not okay, and I feel very strongly that this is a sign of emotional abuse. I hope it is not worse behind closed doors.\n\nSo, to those who might have been in a similar position as me before, or if you have been in relationships where your SO treats you poorly around friends but never acknowledges it or gaslights you: how would you suggest I proceed as an outsider who may have some weight in this ongoing situation?\n\ntl;dr my friend seems to be emotionally abusing his girlfriend in group settings and doesn't acknowledge it or take the hint that he upsets her. What can I do?\n\nEdit: Thanks so much for all the advice. I tried to explain the situation as straightforward as possible despite it being extremely complicated, and I think I did a good job because the advice I got was pretty much spot on. I am still open to different perspectives and thoughts though!!\n\nnote: I think she knows we do not support this behaviour, which might be why she chooses to still hangout with us despite what she has to endure from him. Most of times we are the ones who invite her to hangout (not him) so I think that helps in some way at making her feel welcome and supported. I can definitely do much more though.", "subreddit": "emotionalabuse"}

I keep on thinking how I got here, all the wrong decisions I must have made to be where I am. full of PTSD and an empty shell of who I once was. The only mistake I found was meeting you. \n\nYou know it's funny I constantly question my behavior I feel so stupid for being the big mess I am today but then I remember, I remember everything you did, everything you said and everything makes sense. I keep thinking that it's my fault that I did something wrong that I somehow deserved all of it, people tell me I'm wrong they show the human decency and empathy you never showed and it makes me wonder why it's so hard to believe it and then I remember the way you conditioned me to believe that I was a terrible person. the way you implemented fear in my every breath the way you took away everything that once brought me happiness and made it all about you. \n\nI keep telling myself it's not my fault and I feel so dumb for not believing it but how could I? when you spent years traumatizing me. When you made sure I know that it was indeed all my fault no matter how much I fought no matter what I said.\n\nYou liked to call me miss blameless, a murderer, a coward you told me that every single thing I did made you want to die you told me that I was the reason you hated yourself I know now that you're piece of shit but I can't explain the amount of pain those words brought me back then because they came from the person i thought I loved the most.\n\n All I wanted was for you to love me, I wanted to make you happy but I was never able to do it and it made me feel so horrible, you talked wonders of your other friends you showed me videos of your fun times together and told me that me being upset over it was just me being a crazy bitch, but i wasn't i wasn't jealous it just hurt so much to know that everyone was capable of making you happy and all I ever got from you were suicide threats, I always wondered what I lacked. \n\nEven in what could be considered our best moments you treated me horribly, you would get annoyed at me for not being good at a game, you'd get mad at me for using a simple emoji. I remember last December when you went on a trip, I wanted to so badly talk to you before you left I wanted to wish you a good flight and tell you how much I was going to miss you but you took your anger out on me yet again you yelled at me and told me to leave you alone, even when I did nothing wrong you seemed to hate me so much and I never understood why.\n\nThe cocky part of me wants to believe that maybe you hated me so much because I had everything you lacked I had an immense amount of empathy I cared so much about others and things, I was passionate about so many things and I had a lot of hope and you were so empty. I don't know why I ever thought you would have changed, I guess I hoped that you loved me enough to want to change that you'd want to be enough for me that you'd want to make me happy but you never loved me in the first place. \n\nAt first I thought that maybe you didn't know you were hurting me but after crying almost every day and begging you to stop you must have known right? I remember that when I used to cry in front of you you didn't comfort me instead you would throw things and get mad. I don't understand what I did to deserve to be treated so badly but maybe there really is no reason for it. I did everything I gave you absolutely everything, I gave up my dreams for you, I changed my life, my own schedule, my friends everything to fit your needs.\n\n I remember when I told you about my dreams to move to a big city and how you told me how unfair I was being how I'm supposed to be with you. I remember telling you I never wanted kids and you threatening to leave me because of it. I remember telling you that it's too soon to talk about marriage and you accusing me of not loving you enough. Before I knew it I had gotten rid of my dreams and gave in to yours. I did what you wanted.\n\n I guess you wanted me to so you could take it all away. I remember telling you various times that I was asexual that I wasn't comfortable with sex hell I was barely comfortable with kissing but you told me how pure it was how normal it was for us to want those things. I remember how uncomfortable I was the first time. I remember you sending me unwanted pictures and turning every single conversation sexual. I remember that I stopped hearing your voice because you were so neglectful and the only time I heard it was when you were moaning my name.\n\n Soon enough I was so deprived of any human affection that I started to seek out those things too not because I wanted it but because I wanted to feel loved by you. You got mad any time I was with friends, any time I had an interest in something, you told me various times how I only needed you and yet you blamed me for being clingy for being too much. \n\nI only ever did what you wanted and those exact things were the ones you used against me. I have never encountered such evil and thats coming from someone who grew up in an extremely abusive household no other person has ever managed to take absolutely everything from me. \n\nIs that why you did it? because you wanted me to be as empty as you are? I remember that you once called me a leech you said I sucked the good out of people and left them dry and moved to the next person, funny how that seems to just describe you perfectly. \n\nYou might be on top now, you may be so much happier now and I'm the lowest I've ever been but there's a difference between you and me. I'm human, I'm capable of loving someone I'm capable of caring for someone I'm capable of having dreams, I'm capable of having hope. You aren't and you'll spend the rest of your life trying to fill that emptiness using people I might have not know who you even are but the only true thing i witnessed was how miserable you are inside. \n\nEven if you never pay for the horrible things you've done even if you have the perfect life I'm better than you and I will always be because I don't hurt other people, I'm not an abusive monster like you are, I'm kind and caring and I'm loved, for who I am not for someone I pretend to be, and no one can ever truly love someone like you and you can't ever take that away from me.", "subreddit": "NarcissisticAbuse"}

They are the most vicious kinds of people you could ever encounter in life. Good looking narcissists also suck, but there's just something about ugly narcissists where they are EXTRA evil and demonic. I'll tell you why soon enough.\n\nThis year my life was made extremely difficult and I was intensely bullied by two ugly narcissistic individuals to the point of hospitalisation and suicidal ideation. Let me tell you why they are terrible: because of their looks, they are deeply bitter and angry inside. They seek to suck the self esteem out of you dry until there is nothing left, to feel better about themselves and are awfully relentless with it. They will set out to destroy your entire wellbeing. They take out their anger with their appearance on you and become insufferable if they ever feel rejected by you in any way. As narcissists, they will employ inhumane tactics and words to make your life a living hell.\n\nAll narcissists regardless of appearance are to be avoided, but if they are ugly and you spot that they are narcissistic (e.g. take criticism and rejection really badly) PLEASE STAY WELL AWAY. I mean, don't even talk to them at all or have any interaction with them whatsoever.\n\nI'm really not a shallow person, but I was doing some reflection after this torment and this is something that really drove home to me.

I was hoping for some sort of closure, someone who wouldn't sweep it all under the rug, and who i could reconnect with from my past. It was an awful mistake. She basically reopened all my trauma and made my mother seem like someone worth saving(in the eyes of god) and that she would continue to be friends with her because at some point my mother wasnt such an awful person. She briefly told me that my mother had suspicions that one of my brothers (14) might be doing things to my sister (4).

This friend lives in hawaii so she often visits to the midwest to \"check up on things\". I have been terrified and my wounds have been reopened because of this.

I remember that in the dream I tried to lift myself up and look over my shoulder and seeing my friend\u2019s roommate but was unable to really hold myself up before laying back down. \n\nThis was a weird dream, and definitely freaked me out, but I was fairly certain it was just a dream. After all, I went to sleep with pajama pants on and wasn\u2019t wearing any in the dream. But then, the next night when I woke up, my friend was masturbating beside me. I think she was masturbating in her sleep, because she didn\u2019t acknowledge it the next day or stop when I moved around obviously until I eventually got up and left the room. \n\nAfter this, I\u2019ve been internally freaking out about my first dream. Along my google searches for some sort of explanation, I learned about sexsomnia and it turns out my friend has another sleep disorder that tends to go along with sexsomnia. Now, I\u2019m worried that she was fingering me in my sleep and my brain explained it as best as it could while I was in a REM state. \n\nIs it possible that this assault was real or is it more likely just a weird dream after a night of drinking?", "subreddit": "survivorsofabuse"}

But it's always there. You've made me hate myself in ways I didn't even know I would. You made me hate every last detail of my face, my whole appearance, my voice, my mentality, everything. I constantly question if I'm just so ugly or if my body is not good enough, maybe I should dye my hair? \n\nWhenever I look in the mirror all I see are the things I'm lacking, the things that made him choose you over me. I know this is stupid, I know that I'm not lacking anything, I know that him choosing someone is not something to want or be proud of, hell I even know that I don't love him and this is the trauma bonding talking but it still hurts. \n\nIt hurts knowing that you got all the things I always wished for. It hurts knowing he treats you better and I spent years begging him to stop hurting me. It hurts knowing that he's making you happy and you're making him happy and that's something I never accomplished. It hurts knowing that you must have been so much better than me that my then boyfriend decided to cheat on me for months.\n\n I remember when we talked I remember at first how glad I was that you decided to talk to me, I was ready to open up to you to tell you the horrible things this man has done to me, to unmask him and tell you all the lies he's told you. You reminded me so much of me and I genuinely didn't want you to get hurt but then you started accusing me of lying, of being bipolar, of trying to make you jealous. You dismissed all the years of extreme abuse and blamed me for it. You told me to get over my trauma and told me to stop bothering you and him. \n\nI know you're very immature, I could notice when you told me that you'd never let him treat you that way as if being abused is something one chooses. Empathy soon turned into anger and all that anger turned into insecurity. \n\nIt's Christmas now, and I'm giving myself the gift of compassion, towards myself not towards people who don't deserve it. Because what did you win exactly? A man who never takes responsibility for his actions? A man who abuses and threatens people to get what he wants? A man who is capable of sexually abusing someone and not showing an ounce of empathy? A man who can't ever truly change or feel genuine love?\n\n I might have been very manipulated by him but I know that I would have never stood for what you stand for. I would have never gave out the message than any type of abuse is okay, I would have never victim blamed. Because that's the message you're ultimately giving by being with him, not just to me but you're telling every person who was ever abused that it doesn't matter that their pain doesn't matter.\n\n You like to preach about God saying to forgive people, now I'm not a religious person but there's a difference between forgiving someone who genuinely feels sorry and is willing to change than to dismiss someone elses trauma and enabling a monster. Sure you might be \"prettier\" and he might have \"chosen\" you instead but I think that's what saved me. \n\nI will never stand for what you stand for, I won't ever shame someone for being treated so horribly and unfairly and you might have gotten him, but I got myself. Good luck with that monster you chose over human empathy. I might not have him or that fake relationship based on lies that you two have but my conscience is clear and I'm happy for who I am and what I stand for and I will always be better than you two.", "subreddit": "NarcissisticAbuse"}

Vomiting for two days straight. I wanted to take her to the emergency vet, but he said no. (She was my dog before we met). He didn't think it was warranted nor did he want to pay the high cost of the emergency clinic. How can you put a price tag on an animal's health? It's not as if we cannot afford it, we both work full time and earn decent salaries. I don't know why I let him make the decision to wait. \n\nI was an emotional mess when Monday morning came and she was still sick, this time throwing up from water. We were trying to wait until the regular vet clinic opened...but he left the house for his workout and I made the decision on my own to take her in. I called him, told him that he needed to come back home, and that I was going with our without him (in retrospect, I should have gone alone). He was upset that he had to cancel his personal training session. \n\nWhen he got home, I was rushing to get the dog into the car. He said, \"I'll be ready soon, I need to clean the vomit up off the carpet.\". I said, \"The carpet can wait. I am going NOW.\"\n\nThe whole drive there he was giving me the silent treatment (because I yelled at him). I finally stood up to him for the health of MY dog. \n\nSo as we are waiting for the vet to do testing, I was super stressed. I didn't know if she had a blockage, cancer, pancreatitis, gastritis...no clue what was going to happen. And yet as we sat there, he never offered a word of support or kindness. He was giving ME the silent treatment...so I start reading my phone (reddit posts)...then he started staring at me...mumbling about how LONELY HE WAS. I kept looking down because I knew I'd get a tongue lashing if I looked up and met his cold, ruthless eyes. So then he started sighing loudly and tapping his foot. I continued to read...he got up and left the room for a few minutes. I was relieved that he was out of my space. He returned a few minutes later and did the exact SAME thing all over again. The only relief was the vet coming into the room to provide periodic updates. \n\nIt's AMAZING that they can act normal when they want to. It's like they flip a switch. They appear calm and collected to the world, while acting like crazy lunatics with us. That's how I know that he CAN CONTROL his rage and anger. \n\nSo we get her home and he proceeds to verbally abuse me for yelling at him. He threatens to leave me. He threatens to divorce me. I just wanted to leave but I stayed so that I could take care of my dog.\n\nWhen I called him for an update this morning while I am at work, he was offended that I didn't ask how HE was doing. What a baby. Oh, and last night, despite strict orders for a bland diet of rice and boiled chicken, he gave her a flipping dog biscuit. He told me about it today. Naturally, I was upset. I asked why he did that, to which he replied, \"I forgot\". When I pressed, \"How could you FORGET? She was vomiting ALL weekend...\" Then he said, \"because it's my routine with her. I take her outside and then she gets a biscuit when we get back inside. I didn't want to break my routine.\"\n\nThese people really are all about ME, ME, ME, ME....\n\nThe final creepy thing about this story...the total vet bill was \"triple six\". I thought to myself, \"that makes sense...I am with the devil right now after all\".\n\nThe upside to this story is that my dog is doing better today :)", "subreddit": "NarcissisticAbuse"}

Those who are far in their healing welcome to answer.", "author": "2340000", "self_text": "*This is similar to another post I made, and I'm still posting it because I still feel really confused.*---- Since I've been discarded I've been researching everything and of course I've come across the term codependency. Some psychologists say it's a myth, some say it's a personality type, others say it's a symptom of abuse - meaning a person only becomes codependent *after* being abused. The most interesting distinction is that codependency wasn't coined to describe victim/abuser relationships, it was used to describe an addict and his partner.\n\nI agree with the psychologists who say that to a certain degree, everyone is codependent: new employees trying to get approval from their boss, people on social media posting things for likes, etc. But one thing I want some feedback on is the nagging, passive aggressive, and manipulative characteristic \"codependents\" are given. I read that codependency comes from an inability to establish boundaries. And when a codependent tries to establish boundaries it's believed they nag and are passive aggressive about it leading to the conclusion that they are just as manipulative as their abusive partner. I read: *instead of setting the boundary and following through, they constantly repeat themselves, criticize, and blame their partner for abusive behavior. This may lead the codependent to threaten to leave although they will not, reinforcing their lack of boundaries.* \n\nI think that codependency gets murkier considering relationships in which one partner is narcissist or cluster b.\nBecause of betrayal blindness I was semi-unaware of ex's abuse. The first time something serious happened I tried to establish boundaries. He deflected and essentially told me it was my fault. In my gut I felt unsafe but I could not actually decide truth about \"whose fault it was\" because he used excuses, guilt stories, and gaslighting, so I really did believe it was my fault. But at the same time I kept digging for the truth and confronting him about inexcusable things he did only to get the same result - 1. he tells me I have it all wrong, 2. I believe him, 3. I realize he's lying, 4. back to stage 1. --- In two instances I would talk about leaving and he'd suddenly get clarity and temporarily treat me better. After each time I \"threatened\" to leave he got worse. It's not like my ex admitted to what he did and despite his acknowledgment I stayed and kept \"criticizing\". I was unsure and stayed despite being unsure. \n\nSo I suppose what I'm asking is this: can someone behaving codependently in truth manipulate a narcissistic person into treating them better? Can you really manipulate a narcissist? Their behavior is abusive, so how is asking them not to abuse you, manipulative? \n\nWhat about seemingly healthy relationships? I'm disappointed this word is typed as gender specific, but \"nagging\" seems to be a common word I find in codependency articles. How can you tell your partner something is not okay/will not be tolerated in a way that isn't codependent or threatening? At what point does it become codependent or nagging? Is it either leave or accept it? That seems too black and white and relationships are more nuanced than that. In retrospect it's not like my ex didn't know what he was doing, he did. He called me negative and \"trying to change him\" with \"unhealthy expectations\". And when I read articles that describe my behavior just as my ex did I just feel so much anger.\n\nAnd by the way my search for answers has brought me to this stage. At this point maybe I'm obsessing. I have no idea if reading these articles are helpful.", "subreddit": "NarcissisticAbuse"}

English isn't my first language, but I'll try to keep it correct.\n\nDisclaimers: \n\n\\-I am freshly turned 18 when the story takes place, my birthday is the 2nd of September.\n\n\\-Now you, dear reader, need to know something. Some of this may sound unbelieveable, and for that reason, keep in mind that our miserable protagonist (AKA: me) is somewhat anti-social due to past experiences, and her only previous girlfriend turned out to only keep him around because he gave good gifts. This story however is about his second girlfriend.\n\n  \n\\-Most of this is going to be texts over discord and facebook, since we lived, and still live quite far away from each other (of which I have now come to be grateful for.)\n\nWe met in October of last year, I was just casually minding my own business when we started talking.  \nA good few moments of messaging each other led us to adding each other on facebook and discord, and from then on we began to get to know each other. And this is where the spinning of the webs that held me captive for a good while after began. We began to talk about each other, or rather, it was moreso me talking about myself. Whether she was pretending to for the moment or not, but she was very insecure about sharing anything concerning her for a good while. We began talking regularly, enjoying each other's company for the time being. She was an introvert posing as an extrovert, talkative, but spins the conversation in a way that she doesn't have to share anything about herself. She was in need of genuine love and so was I, we were both helping each other. Too good to be true.   \n\n\nFast forward about five days, and we've got to know each other rather well, albeit her knowing way more about me than I did about her. There was a rather large barrier between us, due to her living in Serbia while I myself live in Hungary. Oh well, can't be too bad. I'll start arranging to visit her sometime. We continue to mingle with each other, and amongst that begin playing Smite together, and rarely League of Legends. We spend most our time on WoW anyway, roleplaying on &lt;redacted private server name&gt;, the same place where we first met. \n\nA week later she tells me she made a mistake, I ask her what she did. She says she doesn't want to talk about it now, but she'll have to eventually. I continue to inquire for a while, but stop after she reassures me that it's nothing serious (and she was right). Later that day, she switches the subject back to this. I tell her that I'm listening and that she probably did nothing wrong. Instead of being straightforward she begans dropping hints. The final hint gets me to the realisation. \"I'm  LGBT.\" And then it kicks in. Can't be lesbian or gay because she's dating me, a male. Bisexual and transgender are the only ones left, and I feel like bisexuality is not what she was afraid of telling me, considering that I myself told her that I am bi. So I tell her my guess, and she says I'm right, immediately followed by a: \"Do you still love me ?\" I answer with a yes and reasurre her that I do, that this changes nothing and she shouldn't have been afraid to tell me.\n\nTime went on, and we are nearing the end of the first month of the relationship, and this is where crap starts hitting the fan. She'd reguarly break out into large fits, and it was completely random what could trigger it. \"I'm afraid you'll say you don't need me anymore one day\", \"You'll find someone better eventually\", \"I'm not even a real woman\"^(1) and lastly, \"you deserve better.\" I comfort her again, staying up very late each time, she meant everything to me. I could not comprehend that something here was wrong yet, due to my previous experience with my ex-girlfriend before her. At the time, it just looked like she really needs love.\n\nWe are only a few days after the end of the month, and these fits become arguments. This is where her suppressed narcissistic side begins showing itself. She'd constantly get upset over very small things, and argue with me for a good few hours after. She could never be wrong, why would she be wrong ? It's not possible for her to be wrong, obviously I did something wrong. Her arguments would sometimes keep me up late into the night, on one occasion, even keeping me up til 4 AM, and she started to argue with me around 10 PM. Sometimes I was able to make her see a point, but not very often, as more and more arguments came. She made me believe that I was responsible for everything, that her being upset for insignificant and small things was completely normal. Like I said, it was a gamble. I'd never know if what I said would upset her. This made me very carefully think about what I'll say each time, as to not end up in yet another argument once more.\n\nTime passes more, November is nearing it's end, and her influence over me grows. She constantly makes me believe that I've wronged her, and makes me apologise. It got to the point where I'd say sorry way before she even gets into the middle of her rant, just so that the torture could be over. Did that stop her ? HAHA! No! I was not trying to defend my points at all anymore. I never ever thought that she was wrong when we got into an argument after. And this is where the abuse started becoming worse. Whenever she saw fit, she'd push me away from herself and prohibit me from talking to her for \"not being able to behave\".\n\nWe are a few days into December, christmas is coming. \"Good\", I thought. I can finally visit her in Serbia during winter break, and hopefully that might reduce the tensions a bit in this long distance relationship. And my plans are crossed by none other than my overprotective mother... I love my mom, bless her soul. She is the best, and she's gotten very good at adapting to my ducked up state of mind after the experiences in this story. Maybe if she let me visit her things would have been different, maybe she pulled me aside so that I'd dodge a bullet I otherwise wouldn't have, who knows ?\n\nThe arguments continue, and it gets worse and worse. I continue blaming myself every single time, but it seems like even the apologies for her unreasonable fits of anger don't do anything anymore. And then... she decides to give me an ultimatum. \"One more, and we're over\". I became very, and I mean **VERY** careful with what I do and say. I must not upset her, I don't want to lose her. Still not realising that this relationship is about as healthy as a diet consisting of only McDonalds food, like the idiot I was.\n\nI talk to her now and then, but notice that she isn't really talkative nowdays. She usually replies to me with \"yes.\", \"yes?\" or \"no.\", and that's it. That's about as much as she wants us to be talking a day, as she'd never bother to start a conversation, let alone reply more when I am the one making the attempt. I fucking hate my life. I get constant headaches around that point and began making questionable decisions, treating people I love like I really shouldn't.\n\nAt this point, only a few days passed after the first week of December. I decide to call her out on it. Not confrontationally of course, that would be unfair of me, or so her influence made me think. As humble as I can, I bring this fact up with her. She is, of course, well and aware of it. Completely neglecting my pleas to spend some time together. Out of desperation, I turn to asking her the question she asked me a lot. \"Do you still love me ?\" I get a reply. \"I don't know. I need to think about it.\" I acknowledge it and let her think, and... I make a decision I really shouldn't have.\n\nAnd after that, it really starts getting to me. I begin smoking, drinking, skip school for 2 weeks straight until winter break starts. I still have to make my parents think that I'm going to school of course. At first I drive off to a place where I can be alone, only me and my thoughts. I picked a forest close to the city for this. Later, my hiding spot changes. I don't even want to go out anymore. I just hide in our garage and don't even bother to ride my bicycle to the forest. I wouldn't have been able to get away with this if the doctor I went to wasn't so understanding, and certified these absent days.\n\nWinter break starts and I'm still feeling like shit. I drink in secret and confront my parents about my other addiction, smoking. To my surprise, my mother is very understanding and supportive. I probably wouldn't have been able to get off smoking if it wasn't for her. It only took five months after the breakup with her help.\n\nChristmas Eve comes, and I wish my, at the time still girlfriend Merry Christmas. I expect nothing more than the same wishes, instead I get scolded and told that it is tomorrow. Apparently her family doesn't celebrate Christmas Eve, or doesn't know it's a thing. I don't know, I can't remember. \n\nThen comes Christmas day, and around night time I get a message. She has decided that this is not worth continuing. That our love wasn't true.\n\nI continue to skip school for one more week after, hiding in our garage as usual, waiting until the usual time I get from home school before walking in through the door. I begin feeling slightly stronger after that week, I no longer skip school. I do not stop abusing alcohol, the amount of vodka I drank and cigarettes smoked was a hefty amount.\n\nEventually during my rehabilitation I get better, both mentally and physically. I stop smoking after the aforementioned 5 months, but continue to drink. The summer helped me get rid of that habit too, partly. I still think about her, and while I've become more accepting of the truth, sometimes I am still left feeling saddened after it comes to mind.\n\nWould I get back together with her if given the opportunity ? Hell no! Is it still hurtful that things ended up this way ? Hell yes!\n\nAnd we've gotten to the end of our story.\n\nSo, here's to a better Christmas! It is virtually impossible for it to be bad, considering the last one.\n\n^(1): As stated in the story, she is a transgender woman. For some reason she believed this made me not love her.", "subreddit": "NarcissisticAbuse"}

But for me, I go do a 5k with friends and shave my legs for the event \"why are you shaving your legs, what are you really doing???\" I go to my company's Christmas party that is at a Hotel conference hall for over 500 employees \"oh a hotel?

{"post_id": "ef8fes", "created_utc": 1577228221, "title": "Flash backs make the holidays hard", "author": "FluffyMcStabbykins", "self_text": "A little back story to all of this. In July of 2017 I had that gut feeling that he was cheating. He showed very little interest in me and our kids. We had spent 4th of july weekend at his parents cabin, some where I hadn't been before and was rife with memories of my MIL who had passed away the prior November. It was hard for me to be in a place that she had always wanted me to go to. It was hard to see all of her things there and I wondered what it would have been like if she was there. Late one night during that trip I was sitting in her rocking chair and started to cry. He laid on the couch adjacent to me and just said \"yeah it sucks doesn't it.\" He didn't comfort me and seemed annoyed that I was having emotions.\n\nWe had been having major problems. Easter weekend before this trip he had gotten kicked out of my parents house, who we were living with. I had told him we were headed down the path of divorce and we needed to get counseling to help repair the damage in our relationship, and I was met with excuses and claims that we didn't need therapy. Now we come to the week before Thanksgiving 2017. I had already been contemplating asking for a divorce when he sprung it on me one night. I agreed with him about the divorce and I wanted to do it amicably. For the next 3 weeks it was utter hell.\n\nHe was convinced I was cheating because I didn't fight the notion of divorce. When he initially brought up divorce I hadn't yet learned he was in fact cheating on me. When I found out I reacted poorly and like a crazy person. He had already obtained a plane ticket and was set to leave December 9th. And in the week leading up to his leaving I went from begging him to stay and work on our relationship to realizing I was fighting for a man who no longer loved me.\n\nOnce I came to this realization and decided to let it go and told him he was free to leave, he all of a sudden changed his mind. Just one morning or hours of conversation and me telling him I know he would be happier with her, he all of a sudden wanted me and our family. I regret letting him stay... what the next nine months brought me tore me down but also built me up. But I still wish I hadn't given him that last chance.\n\nSo the holidays are a big bag of mixed emotions for me. I lost a woman I loved dearly, my ex cheated on me and was going to leave us without any concern for his children. But then my family and I have a strong bond. They helped me through that time ensuring that my kids had presents for Christmas morning. Presents I couldn't afford because I was a SAHM and he had lost his job. My family rallied around me and my kids and made sure I knew we were loved.\n\nNo matter how selfish he was, no matter how cruel he was, my family made sure I got through it. And in those times where I miss him I just remind myself there was more bad then there ever was good. I remind myself of how he disregarded our children's wants and needs. I'm better off without him. We are better off without him.\n\nI'm still working on myself and picking up the pieces, but it gets easier every day. I will never put myself in that position again. And I'm lucky to have two happy and healthy kids that are excited about christmas morning. And I can't wait to watch them open their presents tomorrow morning.", "subreddit": "NarcissisticAbuse"}

The signs of N-behavior have been piling up for months (and even more so lately) and I just couldn't take it anymore.  In the beginning, she would make fun of me, belittle me for earning less than her (at one point telling me in verbatim that \"I have no value\", despite the fact that I'll be making an above-average income soon), freaking out over me having small holes in my clothes (she's of Ukrainian descent and she says dressing nicely is important to them), and the mistakes I made in my past relationships. She's frequently had dreams of me cheating on her despite that I've never cheated on anyone in my entire life, and she has held those suspicions against me in the real world... the list goes on.  Regarding her insecurity about me cheating, I was extremely sensitive whenever she would tell me, as I've been cheated on a total of 5 times by 4 different women. I have insecurities too. One time I had a dream like this and she got defensive and kinda angry about it.\n\nFast forward 6 months to today... I was on the way over to her house to give her her birthday present when she sent me a social media post titled \"Learn how to apologize\", which listed a series of \"non-apologies\" on the left-hand side and healthy apologies that exhibit accountability on the right side.\n\nDuring a drinking game at her birthday party 2 days earlier, she said something to her friends that made me feel really insecure. They asked her if she had ever had a money shot and how she felt about them. She smiled somewhat sheepishly and pleasantly, shrugging her shoulders and simply saying \"yeah\" (her and I have never done this - she talks about how she's pretty innocent).  So I confronted her about it two days later, saying how uncomfortable that made me feel, and she said *\"actually, that was a lie. I was just rolling with what they were saying. I couldn't remember. I didn't want to stand out.* ***Sorry*** ***it made you uncomfortable***\\*\"\\*.\n\nI told her I was sorry to bring it up on her birthday, but that I felt like I had to bring it up because I kept having intrusive thoughts regarding it and it was making it extremely difficult for me to think straight. We kept talking about it for a bit, with her essentially concluding that I'm insecure (there was never a heartfelt apology for lying). FWIW, she very frequently talks about her ex-boyfriend who she also deemed insecure and admits she was verbally abusive and violent to.  Once she had pinned the blame on me, she said \"now come treat me like a princess\".  \\*She will make what I've come to call \"narc-jokes\", which are so commonplace that I just drown them out now\\*  I ignore it and head to her place to give her the gift, hoping another fight doesn't ensue.\n\nIt's important to note that the very first sentence from that non-apology list she'd sent me read: \"I'm sorry **you feel** that way\", which is exactly what she had been guilty of just hours earlier.  Another one of the sentences listed was \"I'm sorry, but...\", which I was also guilty of.\n\nWhen I got to her house, I brought up the list as calmly as possible, asking her what she was insinuating by showing it to me.  She said \"it's for bringing up your insecurities on my birthday. You said you're sorry but you kept talking about it.\"  I said \"Ok, I'll work on getting better at apologies... Now, do you see anything in that left column that you've done recently?\" No response. I then say \"you lied to impress other people, I got hurt by it, and you never apologized\". She has a strange visible malfunction where her face retorts, she stares off into the distance, and turns back to me saying \"I didn't say that\".  I said \"yes, you did, I'll show you\" as I begin pulling out my phone to find the text where she said \"I lied\" in verbatim.  She said \"that's because it wasn't even that big of a deal\".  I said \"but it was a big deal to me. It hurt me\". She jolts upright in her seat, widens her eyes and cocks her head, raising her voice and snarling \"do you wanna fight, or do you wanna leave?! This is my birthday!\"  I said \"you're contradicting yourself. A healthy relationship means we both have to hold ourselves accountable for our behavior. I'm just asking the same thing of you that you're asking of me.\"  Then she pulls out her phone and starts scrolling madly, seemingly in search of something. I sit there and watch her for 2 minutes straight before asking \"what are you looking for?\", to which she calmly says \"nothing.\"\n\nI then picked up my coat, put my shoes on, told her she needs to take a good look in the mirror, and left.  When I got home, she sent me a text accusing me of being delusional.  This was my first time being so obviously slighted, gaslighted, and stonewalled when I tried to stand up for myself, all in one day.  So this is the story of how I walked out on my narcissist on her birthday...  It wasn't easy and I never thought I'd do that to someone on their own personal holiday, but I was so deeply disturbed at how shockingly self-righteous and callous she was acting. Just because it's your birthday doesn't give you a license to treat others any less decently than you normally would.\n\nP.S. - I went home and looked up all of our past texts (that's 8 months of texts), and loosely counted the number of times each of us say we're sorry.  85-90% of the time it's me saying sorry (out of a total of 171 times), and it's been in a healthy way almost every time.  About a third of the time she says sorry it's in a non-apologetic and deeply hurtful way.  I had that feeling in my head all along when I was driving over there, which is why I refused to put up with her flabbergasting lack of self-awareness and habit of projecting any longer.\n\nI'm thinking I'll reformat this post since there's so much dialogue. Let me know if you think that's a good idea. Thanks so much for reading and any of your advice or comments! I could really use your support.", "subreddit": "NarcissisticAbuse"}

I've been dealing with this for over a year now and I can genuinely say that this was the absolute worst year of my life. But, here's the kicker...\n\nSo I chose to leave said narc because I realized I had a much better connection with a new girl and wanted to pursue it. This completely infuriated ex narc who made it her personal mission to destroy me.  This is where things get more fucked up. The girl I left ex narc for (we'll call her N) has turned out to be 10x as abusive as previous ex. She has been using my current situation of being on bond to basically blackmail me and terrorize me for an entire year. She's said things like \"if you don't do this, I'll show up to court and tell them that you have abused me which you know will surely get you convicted...\".She's threatened multiple times that unless I pay her, she's going to support the girl I'm being prosecuted for because she knows that the govt does not care about the accused's evidence or word, it's all about the fact that she's a woman and if she sides with original narcs statements, they'll automatically believe her...\n\nMy life has been completely upended to the point of absolute depression. I've seriously contemplated and taken steps towards my own suicide multiple times this year, but haven't been able to follow thru due to the fact I have a daughter. But, since N has seen how easy it was for me to be arrested by K's (original narc) allegations, she has used my situation as a way to hold me complete hostage to her demands. She's threatened to side with K just out of spite in hopes of getting me sent to prison for as long as possible. She's told me that she'll make allegations that I've abused her too because she knows that the prosecution will absolutely eat it up whether it's true or not. I feel that in this age of the MeToo movement, it's a real real possibility. I'm scared shitless and can't believe I ended up with not one, but two severely disturbed Narcs who want to send me to prison over relationship issues. \n\nI'm sincerely at the end of my line. I can't figure out which way too turn or what to do and I feel like my life is literally in the hands of a woman who knows she can use the system to get rid of me ... I honestly don't know if I'll continue on like this - it has been the most traumatic experience of my entire life. I have continued giving N the feeling of control because I feel that if I go NC, she'll make due on her threats the same way K did originally. She knows she always has the card to play because she watched K do it and saw every step. She literally saw how simple it was. Idk what the fuck to do anymore. I've dealt with this situation for over a year now and I've literally lost everything. I've lost my job, almost all my money, my reputation has been destroyed. I couldn't afford to fight another prosecution anyways, especially over someone that I left the original narc to be with in the first place! I'm just list and hate the feeling that I have to accept going to prison over all this when it's literally two woman abusing the system to control me...

Even the most supportive of families can mean well, but it can be overwhelming when you are dealing with trauma. \n\nJust know that we in this community hear you, we see you, and we want you to take the time this season to not be hard on yourself. Don\u2019t punish yourself- don\u2019t force yourself to heal or to hide, don\u2019t try to unhealthily repress what you feel. Your emotions and thoughts are valid, and they belong to you alone. You alone own those emotions and decide how to feel. \n\nPlease take some alone time if you can this season- if you are in a place that has a park, or a green space that is safe, I suggest going outside if you are able to and be in the sun. And if you are unable to go outside or being mobile is a difficulty, I find it is nice to play \u201crain sounds\u201d and just close my eyes and drown out everything. \n\nIf you feel yourself having a panic attack or lose control, I suggest you don\u2019t try to stop it. It\u2019s like when you feel your car begin to skid our of control- it is worse if you try to over-correct the car, and is best if you just ride out the skidding. Emotions can be a lot too, so don\u2019t fee obliged to take it all on at once- but I find that trying to stop a panic attack (i.e by. being quiet so no one can hear) makes it worse for me, and I spiral more. Just let it flow through you, and the panic attack will run its course. \n\nFor those who have to be in contact or proximity with abusers, I suggest making a few escape plans before you have to go. Plan A, plan B, even all the way to Z if needed. Try to have safe spaces where you can escape to if you are overwhelmed, and if things are out of hand, there are many hotlines available in each country that may be of service. \n\nI tried to cover it all, I think, but I know I didn\u2019t. I just wanted to speak to you, whomever you are, and reach out to you and hold you tight. You can do this, I know you can- and you know you can. Take things day by day and don\u2019t be hard on or blame yourself. \n\nI wish you all support and peace this holiday season.", "subreddit": "survivorsofabuse"}

It\u2019s high pressure on the brain, but no cause has yet been found.

By me.\n\nSo now I\u2019m stuck on christmas day with a guy who ignores me and is mad at me for feeling down. I feel down because I can\u2019t share anything with him as he is not interested in anything I like, and I feel all alone. I feel homesick, want to go back to my parents, but am now stuck with him and have to leave to go to his mom.

(Self harm/suicide warning)", "author": "Throwaway40728", "self_text": "Throwaway because I don\u2019t want anyone I know finding this post and some friends know my main account.\n\nFor the longest time, it\u2019s always just been me and my mom. When we left my biological father I was the only thing that kept her going, so it\u2019s pretty hard to wrap my head around what my friends and therapist have been saying.\n\nMy mom is in desperate need of therapy, everyone knows it and she knows it. Her anger issues get bad. I\u2019ve never really known what I can and can\u2019t do in the past because one thing I could do yesterday was something that would make her blow up today. We had rules, yes, but I was always walking on eggshells when it came to her moods. She scared me. She would constantly push me in school, telling me how lucky I had it and how I have to succeed for her sake because she never had that opportunity. It eventually led to self harm and my first suicide attempt. When my mom found the pill bottle and me curled up on the floor crying, the first thing she did was start yelling. She backed me into a corner, yelling in my face about why I would do this and why didn\u2019t I just take the whole bottle(she had a headache that day and I wanted to leave some painkillers for her). Ended up in the ER and eventually in a psyche ward. That was when I got a therapist, because it was prescribed to me by the ward.\n\nBefore all that happened, I had told her about how I was feeling. About my depression and how everything was overwhelming. It was emotional and she promised that she\u2019d get me help. It, well, never came. She took me to see a therapist once, which was more of an interview than anything, then it never came up again. Things just fell back into their stressful routine. When she found out about my self harm she yelled, asking how I thought she felt and how I was hurting her. \n\nI eventually came out to my mom, telling her that I was transgender and wanted to be referred to as a he. She talked about how she gave birth to a girl and nothing could change that. She\u2019s gotten way better since then, but she still refuses to call me by my chosen name and constantly misgenders me. I\u2019ve tried talking to her about how it made me feel but then she talked about how hard it was for her. I mean, I understand that. It can\u2019t be easy knowing that your child wants to be something else, but up until then she was an overprotective control freak. It got worse when I told her I was an atheist. She told me I couldn\u2019t be and she was going to take me to church that week so I can understand. I ended up making another attempt on my life before she could do that.\n\nShe likes messing with my meds. I\u2019ve been put on three different ones, each really important to keep me balanced and able to function. She always tells me how I don\u2019t need them and how it\u2019s just all in my head. Lately I\u2019ve been doubting myself because of that, because what if it is all in my head and I\u2019m just bothering them with all this stuff that I don\u2019t actually need. \n\nShe\u2019s gotten a lot better, but some of the things I mentioned are still issues. I love her, I really do, but I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s healthy to have a relationship like this. It\u2019s a constant back and forth, from her hurting me to her being nice and me forgetting, straight back to hurting me.

I found a comment on YouTube which pretty much summed my ex up it \n\np.s the words in brackets are my personal experiences with each narcissistic trait.. the comment read:\n\n1. They are attention seekers (it had to be all about him, he had to laugh the loudest, shout the loudest, dress the flashiest)\n\n2. They crave VALIDATION all the time to cover up their deep rooted insecurities. That\u2019s why you see them on social media trying to project a false image. (I\u2019m not saying all people who love designer good are narcs but when my ex went out to social events he\u2019d wear Versace shoes, a Versace chain, Micheal Kors watch, D&amp;amp;G shirt and Canada Goose jacket ALL at the same time. He also used to go on about much he hated social media and that it was the \u2018worst thing to happen to society\u2019 all whilst using Instagram, Facebook, Snapchat &amp;amp; Twitter)\n\n3. They are all about manipulation, hiding who they are behind a pre-fabricated FAKE persona. They\u2019ll only show you what they want you to see in them.. which is not who they really are when you are not around. Don\u2019t ever think you are dealing with a decent and honest person \n\n4. They come with an endless trail of train wrecks which they\u2019ll hide from you (Previously my ex and I had a brief breakup after an argument. During the week he basically met with a girl on Tinder, love bombed her and told her how amazing she was and how he wanted to be with her, keep in mind this was after speaking to her for 3 day..he said he\u2019s been alone for a while and she was what he has been missing in his life.. he went as far as getting an STD testto prove to her he\u2019s clean.. in the messages she was stating how weird it was that he liked her so much and she didn\u2019t understand why, they spoke about ex\u2019s and he never brought me up even though we were together for almost 3 years and had only broken up the week before. Eventually she said she just wanted to be friends and he immediately blocked her and came back to me and acted as if nothing happened, I had no idea of any of this until a week after we had gotten back together. That was the last time we were ever together.\n\n5. They have no love to offer. The most you will get from them is cooperation as long as long as they are able to get what they need either Validation, status, sex or a good time.\n\n6. They never care about you or your feelings or your needs are met, it\u2019s all about them (when ever I was upset about something he always invalidated my feelings and told me why I couldn\u2019t feel they way I felt.. he was also extremely selfish sexually I never got foreplay, my pleasure was never considered.. it was honestly like he was masturbating with my body. very selfish \u2018lover\u2019 as long as he got his he was fine)\n\n7. \u201cThank you and \u201csorry are unknown words to them. Their maturity level is way off. (I would constantly apologise for everything if when it was blatantly his fault I think I can count one time that actually said sorry in 2 1/2 years he always has an excuse or reasoning behind the shit he does.. he\u2019s extremely manipulative and intelligent that you almost believe him he has a great way of warping reality and telling me things like \u201cyou forgot what actually happened\u201d when I know exactly what went down)\n\n8. If they say I love you it\u2019s not because they mean it but because they are seeking their own emotional validation (he\u2019d only tell me he loved me if I did as I was told without any questions or talk back, my love language is words of affirmation so it was very important to me that he verbalised his \u2018love\u2019 as well as appreciation which I felt he purposely withheld)\n\n9. They need to feed their egos constantly(I had to constantly praise his mediocrity otherwise he would be upset or worse he would go on tinder/bumble and talk to other girls behind my back)\n\n10. In fact they are unable of experiencing love they way normal people do. Empathy is not a part of their emotional wiring. They are emotionally disabled beyond repair \n\n11. They will be the first ones to leave you on your own because they are only there to take.. not to give or support. That\u2019s why everything is so shallow and superficial with them.\n\n12. They operate in a surreal reality denying what\u2019s obvious with no sense of right and wrong. No morals. No decency. (The worst thing he ever did to me was when my dad passed away last year after a sudden heart attack. I was at my ex\u2019s house at the time and my sister who was 15 at the time found my dad alone.. long story short my father was taken to the morgue and I didn\u2019t want to stay at the place my dad had just in died so I asked my boyfriend if me and my sister can stay at his.. he even comforted me when the undertakers were wheeling my dads body out of the flat. He set everything up for us and got us comfortable a couple days later I noticed he was distant.. he was UPSET that I was spending all my time with my sister and forgetting about him... unbelievable.. to make matters worse we were laying in bed and a message popped up from a girl called \u2018Sophie\u2019 this is a girl my ex was previously texting from tinder and when I found out he promised he\u2019d never talk to her again and I believed him.. fast forward to my dad passing he is now talking to her again I ask why and he tells me it\u2019s because I\u2019ve been neglecting him are you fucking kidding me? I ended up messaging the girl as I realised my ex was following her on Instagram and I told her what was happening she told me that he said his \u2018UNCLE\u2019 (my father) had died and how his \u2018COUSINS\u2019 (me and my sister) were staying over and he was looking after them. I confronted him and at first he denied it of course until I showed him proof he said he didn\u2019t care and immediately broke up with ME. \n\nI tried to leave that same day but he held me back and started begging me to stay my little sister was in the other room and I didn\u2019t want her to hear the commotion, I was so numb from my dad being gone so suddenly when I had seen him the previous day I didn\u2019t even react I couldn\u2019t I had no emotional energy to give. \n\nMy mother lives in abroad and was waiting for her flight so I had no where to go I called her and told her what happened and was mad at me I said why couldn\u2019t I keep it to myself he was more upset that people knew what he did than the despicable thing he did.\n\n13. Stonewalling. Ghosting, emasculation and gaslighting are their weapon of choice ( I often got called \u2018emo\u2019 whenever I showed any emotion other than happy he\u2019d taunt me and ask \u201care you emo again do I need to leave?\u201d He\u2019d call me paranoid, insecure, schizophrenic you name it... at times I believed him. If he was ever upset with me he\u2019d give me the silent treatment. After my fathers death my mother took my sister back with her abroad and I decided to stay for my ex and to finish uni.. big mistake I was alone, vulnerable and mourning and he took advantage.. he\u2019d often leave the house at night and go for walks if we ever had disagreements so I could and these are his words \u201cknow what it\u2019s like to not have him around\u201d he told me on many occasions that no one will love me like he does and that I\u2019m lucky to have him)\n\n14. Whenever they are caught lying or cheating. It\u2019s never their fault. They always play victim and never take responsibility for their own actions or devious behaviour. That\u2019s why they can\u2019t sustain a normal relationship everything they do is fraudulent and fake. Even if you are treating them right it\u2019s never going to work. They just can\u2019t connect. There\u2019s no real bond. No solid foundation to build on. So deep down they know things won\u2019t last (he managed to con me out of \u00a310,000 he was constantly in debt and because It appeared as though he wanted a future with me. to live with each other etc I helped him out with his debt so that we could begin saving for place together.... after all my help he ended up back in \u00a33,000 debt and asked me would I be able to use someone of my dads inheritance to help him out.. I went MAD.. I took a screenshot of every single penny I sent this guy of the years we\u2019ve been together I said how dare he think he\u2019s entitled to my dads hard work after he disrespected him! He got upset and said I was attacking him.. he faked future plans to con me.\n\n15. Usually they line up a replacement before things go sideways or when they realise you are catching up with reality. It might work at the beginning during the honeymoon phase when they are hooking their prey. (He gave me a year before he showed his true colours) on four occasions that I know of he tried finding others on dating apps but always failed)\n\n16. But sooner or later you will find yourself putting more effort trying to hold everything together while your inner voice already realised you made a failed investment. That\u2019s their game. They done it before they\u2019ll do it again eventually the mask will fall off and you find yourself waking up facing the harsh reality. \n\nWaking up to a toxic, sick individual that took you on a ride you didn\u2019t sign up.None of it was authentic. None of it was real.\n\nThank you for reading everyone it\u2019s been tough but I\u2019m going on 4 weeks of no contact. it\u2019s funny because he\u2019s the one that dumped me for exposing his toxic behaviour but it\u2019s the best thing he could have done for me because I didn\u2019t have the strength to leave myself", "subreddit": "NarcissisticAbuse"}

What follows first is a bit of introductory rambling for anyone who feels like reading it.\n\nI'm currently on a downswing and ruminating heavily, even getting the urge to check their social media again in spite of half a year of NC - I'm hoping I won't cave in. Obviously it keeps me from enjoying the holidays as should be. Some of you might experience the same, it's just a particular time of the year now.\n\nMy discard was one year ago, and I know I'm still on the side of traumatized, rather than healed. The sheer emotional cruelty of his hoovers weeks and months after the discard made me finally see something is deeply wrong with this person, even in hindsight during the relationship, and find out about narcissism/cluster B disturbance/abusers. Over the last months I have read SO MUCH on the psyche of abusers and about healing, and certainly learned a whole lot which is really valuable. But I feel the major change towards healing is still missing.\n\nOne aspect of that is that I still feel like he has \"won\". He had discarded me for a much younger dude from a rich family, as I unfortunately I found out by pure accident via the new guy's instagram, 9 months ago. (Nex had some gushing posts days after discard on his own private insta, but without any visible faces. Shortly after that I unfriended because I couldn't bear it. He doesn't know I found out who the new guy is and his insta.) The photos there were the typical disgusting narc fare, them having the biggest fun and romantic outings and super social events just days/weeks after the breakup from me, nex having basically a whole new personality, presenting an incredibly satisfying sex life etc. You know the drill. I've stopped looking about half a year ago, but as narcs are I'm sure it's still all simply showing the best possible life. Even in the unlikely case that they're not together anymore.\n\nNow to the questions:\n\n- How is that not winning? He has everything he wants and gets to use this new guy for money, connections and awesome sex, like he has used me before that, as I can now (somewhat) see. Meanwhile I'm still suffering loneliness, I'm overworked with a terrible work situation that doesn't even leave me much time and energy to meet new people properly, in the time of discard I had freshly moved far away to a different part of the country so my old friend circles are mostly gone. Sure, I know a life of using others is not what I would want myself, but the thing is that HE wants that. He doesn't even want the kind of human connections I want.\n- What can convince me to leave these thoughts about him behind? I know they are unhealthy, and I can't believe I've turned into this bitter frustrated person who keeps comparing myself to a human being that has betrayed me to the core. I used to be able to just say to myself \"these are bad people and they are not worth thinking about\". Why can't I fully think about him like that? Is it because he had me thinking he loved me during the relationship?\n- It's currently extremely hard for me to get to know new people, due to the new job and the new region. I know slowly forming human connections would be really important to gain new self-confidence. Can one improve self-confidence without this?", "subreddit": "NarcissisticAbuse"}

I do want us to have a nice day so If you want and it is best we can always talk about this another day. He said no it\u2019s fine.

{"post_id": "efmnt0", "created_utc": 1577312214, "title": "My Christmas reflection", "author": "karkar1606", "self_text": "To give some back ground, last month I left a 10 year relationship with my narcissistic ex. Christmas was especially a poignant time in our relationship, as he was brought up in a Muslim community so I was able to share my family Christmas traditions with him (he never celebrated before we started to spend Christmas together). As much as it was a beautiful idea to share this, every year my plans, money and mental health would be completely disregarded. I am sharing with you below, as I found that reading other people\u2019s experiences really gave me the strength to realise I was worth more than what I was going through. Side note, there were many more incidents than the below. My apologies for how long this is, I\u2019m finding that writing my experiences are really helping me come to terms with the reality of my situation.\nXmas 2013 - our first Christmas together. I spent \u00a3150-\u00a3200 on food, drink and decorations, and was promised a 50/50 split on the cost which never happened. We went out on Xmas eve, but I decided at 12am it was time for me to get to bed. He wanted to stay with friends for a few more drinks so I went home alone. I woke up at 8am and he hadn\u2019t called or text. I started to panic that maybe I didn\u2019t hear him ring the door bell and frantically started calling him. Straight to VM. I called his friends, no answer. After say 45 mins of panic, the door bell goes. He hasn\u2019t had a wink of sleep, high on cocaine and wants to go to bed. Our first Christmas together and I was alone until he could get out of bed at 4pm. I lied to my family and said he was unwell. At 9pm, he had perked up, and convinced my house mate to get a bag of coke. I was so disappointed and went to bed. I later that year found out he had been messaging another woman he met that night and had a side relationship with her. Stupidly, I took him back with every promise in the world from him that he changed. \nXmas 2017 - our second Christmas together. Again, same money spent on food which I never saw the other half to. We went out on Xmas eve again... then somehow ended up with 20 friends at my place (I literally mean we are walking and it dawns on me people are walking the same way... then same street... then there\u2019s a party they have all been invited to at my flat which I had no idea about). Usual story with my ex, the coke starts arriving and my flat goes from winter wonderland with cute decorations to dvd cases (to sniff coke off) and beer cans all over the place. I go to bed at 6am after thinking \u2018if you can\u2019t beat them, join them\u2019. My ex wanted to have sex and I said no, but then after so much persistence it just happened. I was exhausted, and just got to a point where I rolled over. My ex then in rage stormed out of my room. I was so tired I couldn\u2019t care less. In the late morning we both stirred, and I wished him Merry Christmas. He ignored me. So I got up and walked in the living room. I burst in to tears. My Christmas morning was spent clearing up drugs, booze and cigarettes from a party I didn\u2019t even know I was hosting. After cleaning up, I went back in to my ex who was in bed, and again wished him happy Christmas. Again, ignoring me. After trying to speak to him, he told me \u2018how could it be a happy Christmas, when he had to go masturbate in my bathroom because I wouldn\u2019t put out\u2019. I was frozen. It\u2019s Christmas Day, my family is calling my phone, and I\u2019m being told I\u2019ve ruined Christmas because I wouldn\u2019t have sex with my partner of (at that time) 8 years. After an hour, he got over it and so did I (more happy things were \u2018back to normal\u2019). Christmas afternoon was great, and we had friends over in the evening... again the coke, ketamine and MDMA comes out. It gets to 6am again and I\u2019m so done. I wake up on Boxing Day afternoon, clean up again and I start feeling really really unwell. I take a bath and I still feel awful. When I told my ex, he said to me I was \u2018putting it on\u2019. He said he would do me a favour and go out that night, and I could sleep it off. Side note, we don\u2019t live together at this point. I gave him my keys to come back to my flat after his night at the pub. Cut to 2am and I hear voices in my flat. He invited a few people back but I was SO unwell I couldn\u2019t care. 27th December I wake up to the sound of a phone alarm. I follow the noise thinking he left his phone in the lounge but the alarm is coming from my house mates bedroom. I go in, and there is a girl I have never seen before in my house mates bed. I go back to my bedroom and my ex tells me it\u2019s his friends sister.  I couldn\u2019t get back to sleep, so again I start to clear up booze cans, cigarettes and DVD cases. Later than day I confronted my ex who couldn\u2019t see the issue with his actions, or at least asking/telling me that people were coming back to my flat, whilst I\u2019m in bed with flu.\nXmas 2018 - this thank god was our last. Again I was unwell which I now think was due to stress. I had even said I did not want a repeat of last year, which was just a waste of breath. I stayed in for Xmas eve, and in my attempt to create boundaries, gave my ex a 2am curfew which he stuck to. Christmas morning we wake up, and we go to open presents but I can see he is distant and his head is just a million miles away. He opens his presents, and is making snide remarks like \u2018righhhtt?\u2019 \u2018Well, I don\u2019t need that\u2019 \u2018that is never going to fit\u2019 and never thanks me for a thing. I got in the shower and cried. He started to cook dinner, and asks \u2018where are the onions and garlic?\u2019 But in my crazy Christmas run up I just didn\u2019t have any (he also hadn\u2019t specifically told me anything to buy so I just bought as normal for the past few years). This moment I will never forget, he SCREAMED at me that I had ruined Christmas and the whole thing was pointless. This went on for hours until our friends turned up and it was like the flip of a switch. Kissing me, telling me I\u2019m beautiful, bragging about his amazing gifts.... my head was so confused. Same old story for Xmas evening, the drugs come out. This time, the next day was worse than ever. He woke up and told me I had embarrassed him (I had had a few prosecco\u2019s and was having a merry old time, but nothing more) and his friends thought I was weird. Friends I have known for years, and were joining in with my merriment. I broke down, and said I could no longer be treated like this. I have no idea why I stuck around.\nJuly 2019 - we moved in together. I remain to say I had to move in with him to really realise the gaslighting, manipulation I was suffering and the narcissistic behaviour he displayed. We rented one room in a flat with no lounge so there was no way christmas could be the same. His family home is a no no, and my parents live abroad. My choice would be to go to my parents and have Christmas on the beach (my dream for so many years). Flights were cheap and we could have a nice holiday, but my ex told me he didn\u2019t want to miss out on the annual Xmas eve pub crawl, and if I wanted to stay in he would go to a party by himself. I was gutted, but didn\u2019t make a thing of it and brushed it under the carpet. \n\nNovember 2019- I met my end. I was being name called every day. The abuse started to show signs of things getting physical. He wore me down. I left our flat, and currently am still without a place to live. My brother has got room in his dining room for me and I couldn\u2019t be more at peace with my situation. And also, today I was able to fulfil a dream of Christmas on the beach. I looked out at sea today and realised how far I\u2019ve come.\n\nMerry Christmas all, I wish you strength and courage in 2020.", "subreddit": "emotionalabuse"}

When I was younger (11-16) I was abused by my stepmom (verbal, emotional, rarely physical) and no one helped but it eventually got better. Now I\u2019m having similar issues with my stepdad and I don\u2019t know what to do.\n\nI\u2019ve been home for 8 days and every single day my stepdad has screamed at either me or my mom for no reason. My mom says he\u2019s only like this when my little sister (13F) or I are around (my sister lives with them full time) and that he\u2019s stressed because his daughter (14F) is coming for the holiday like usual. We\u2019re away for the holiday and we\u2019ve been trying our hardest to not upset him but no matter what he always finds some reason (even if he has to make one up) to get absolutely furious. Every day at least once he\u2019s screamed at us, he will cuss at me at the top of his voice and he\u2019s threatened several times to kick me out of the car, the house, and says I\u2019m welcome not to visit for the holidays anymore. Most of his anger stems from the fact that his daughter (my stepsister) has said some transphobic or hurtful things and when I\u2019ve tried to explain why what she\u2019s said is hurtful he will go off on me. He loves to call me an \u201cit\u201d or use my pronouns (they/them) in singular (such as \u201cthey is the problem\u201d) and when he isn\u2019t doing that he uses the wrong pronouns altogether. I tried to explain that \u201cheshe\u201d is an offensive term to my sister and he screamed at me for 10 minutes straight and then humiliated me in public further to make it my fault. He even got my mom to take his side and she didn\u2019t retract later in private like she tends to when he does this.\nHe followed all that up with \u201cwe support you\u201d and \u201cit\u2019s just hard to adjust\u201d. I\u2019ve been out with the same pronouns and (legal) name for 5 years.\n\nTonight we saw the new Star Wars movie and I really loved it. I\u2019m a film student and at my school we\u2019ve been taught it\u2019s extremely rude to leave during the end credits. Without saying a word, my stepdad and stepsister left the theatre and my sister and I sat through the credits thinking nothing was wrong. We get to the lobby and my mom, stepdad, and stepsis are all waiting but he is fuming. I ask why they left and he says nothing, but the minute we get in the car he beings to scream about how disrespectful I am for making him and his daughter wait. He spent the whole ride yelling while my mom tried to reason with him. He just continued to scream and cuss at both of us. We got home and he continued to scream so loud in their room we could all hear it through the walls. When he eventually left to cool down my mom came and apologized to me but said I need to act differently here. She always takes his side one way or another even when she\u2019s saying she supports me. Now that he\u2019s home again we\u2019re all locked in our rooms even though we\u2019re hungry because he\u2019s to angry to see me.\n\nI honestly don\u2019t know what to do anymore. I\u2019m not doing anything to provoke these reactions and I feel incredibly unsafe and hurt. Due to my prior abuse whenever someone raises their voice at me I fear I\u2019m about to be hit and I can\u2019t handle the way he speaks to me even when he\u2019s not angry. He\u2019ll get furious over my mom and I discussing women/minorities rights, if I mention LGBT at all he gets super angry, and when we try to explain politics to him he belittles and yells at us. We can\u2019t even have private conversations about this stuff because if he hears it he\u2019ll butt in and yell at us. When I try to explain to my mom how this makes me feel she just does the same thing she did when I showed her proof of my previous abuse: she tries to sweep it under a rug. The worst part is he works as a case manager for child protective services. He prides himself on knowing \u201cwhat abuse looks like\u201d and was a major reason no one helped me when I was being abused previously.\n\nI\u2019m not even mentioning the way he\u2019s treated us as a family the 8 years he\u2019s been with my mom. We\u2019re very low income and he makes $150k a year but we\u2019ve been on welfare, food stamps, free lunch program, and I\u2019ve had the maximum pell grant at college because he won\u2019t spend a cent on us. He likes to take my mom and sometimes my sisters on expensive family trips (that I\u2019m no longer invited to) but then won\u2019t help us with food expenses, getting clothes, and he didn\u2019t want my mom to help me pay for college (she helps with about $1.5k a year and it saves me from taking out additional loans). We lost our house in 2017 and he had us move in with him and pay utilities as rent, but my mom has always paid for all our living expenses and food to the point where she has been losing money instead of saving like she logically should be. He even forced her to sign her name to a house he bought to flip which ruined her taxes which she relied on to get money for her savings. I only had to live with him for a year and my sister and I shared a small room that barely fit our two beds, we all had to get rid of 90% of our belongings, and we weren\u2019t even allowed to decorate our space because he doesn\u2019t like color in his house. His daughter has a room all to herself that was bigger than our shared room and she stays with him less than a month a year. Now that I\u2019ve moved away I sleep on a pull out couch and he\u2019s constantly trying to throw out the few (re: 2 bins) belongings I fought to keep there since I can\u2019t move all my things into a small dorm. \n\nIs there anything I can do? Besides not coming home ever again. I love my mom and sister and I can\u2019t bear to leave them, it would kill me. I love them more than I hate the way I\u2019m being treated, which is why I keep coming back, but this has been destroying my mental health (I have a stress disorder that results in seizures, chronic pain, and debilitating migraines that is literally only triggered when I\u2019m home now). Please, if anyone has any advice or just some reassuring words it would help me so much. Thank you.", "subreddit": "abuse"}

Back then, I could never imagine how badly things would get for me or for either of us really. We connected really really well intellectually. \n\nThings started to get bad kind of fast. I\u2019m 23 and haven\u2019t been in many serious relationships save one...and really we were better suited as friends. \n\nIn February, he fell into drugs very hard. Meth use and benzo use, the latter had been a consistent problem. He stole my old cell phone and sold it. I didn\u2019t realize until much later. He denied it. The truth never appeared until months later. It sucked for me overall, but I kept telling myself it was because of the drugs. I was sober...I could save him. \n\nIn March, I went on a family vacation. The first day of me being there...he started the cycle of abuse. He told me he hated me, I wasn\u2019t his person, he didn\u2019t want me. We didn\u2019t speak for two days until he came crawling back, begging for me back. I took him back because I really thought I loved this person. He meant so much to me. I felt like I knew him DEEP down...obviously not true because things were new and he was trying to make me feel comfortable with him and push boundaries. It worked, and I\u2019m so ashamed. \n\nFast forward to May. Things had been relatively problem free, but unbeknownst to me, he fell into spice use. No more meth or Xanax, but spice. I didn\u2019t know anything about spice. I never have. He hid that well until I noticed he would fall asleep on me at inappropriate times. He ruined our first trip somewhere because he ran out of spice and he also got benzos. We fought intensely for days. We broke up for a day until he messaged me sincerely apologizing for all he had done to me. He had been crying about it. Unfortunately, I fell for it. \n\nUntil August, he kept having issues with spice. He would relapse, withdrawal, get better and relapse again. I was starting to feel hopeless and depressed. On spice, he was the meanest person alive.\n\nIn August, he became a full fledged, heavy spice user. He started to beat me. \n\nAugust-Now. The beatings were almost everyday with us having good days in between. I so badly wanted things to work out. Today, he relapsed again. Instead of freaking out like I normally did, I stayed calm. He lost all of his spice somehow. He kept blaming me for taking it but I kept to myself all Christmas Eve, trying not to put a damper on my holiday. The next day, I woke up and he still hadn\u2019t found it. I was still being blamed. I guess he also got Xanax again and he was just being vile to me the whole day. Saying he can\u2019t go see his parents now and it\u2019s all my fault. I ended up leaving to go to my parents.\n\nI came back and he had drank all my wine. He was passed out. I didn\u2019t wake him. He woke up on his own and started freaking out. I told him I was going to leave and he hit me in the face with a wine bottle. I left. I ended up getting a message from his ex girlfriend. They met up earlier in the month and they had sex...unprotected sex. So now, not only have I been being beaten, but I also was cheated on. I came back to the house and told him what I had learned. He started to freak out because the ex blocked him and told him she didn\u2019t want anything to do with him. I was crying rather heavily because I feel I had been put through so much by this person. The hitting, the lies, the manipulation...and now I\u2019ve been cheated on? He said I ruined his life because of it. At this point I had enough, and told him I would drive him somewhere else to stay. He went but started hitting me the entire ride. Full force blows to my face and head. I told him I would call 911 if he put enough hand on me. He did...and I called. He started to freak out telling me to hang up over and over again and hitting me when I wasn\u2019t. Eventually he got the phone to hang up and he jumped out. I called back and went through with seeing an officer and filing a report.\n\nAt the end of our relationship, I wasn\u2019t perfect. Rather, a shell of my former self. I slept very late every day. I was cold a lot of the time even if we weren\u2019t fighting because I was depressed. When we fought (over drugs, always) I would cry and beg and he would tell me to stop because it was annoying but I couldn\u2019t stop because I was honest to God having panic attacks at that point. \n\nYet I feel guilt and I just want this person to LOVE me. That is so sick and yet I can\u2019t stop myself from thinking it. I love myself...I know I do. I know I\u2019m worth more than this. I know now that I\u2019ve started the process of police involvement I cannot back down. I am just so scared. Truthfully, when sober I thought this person was MY person. I loved him...I still do. \n\nI feel brainwashed.", "subreddit": "survivorsofabuse"}

We had awful fights and then he calmed down after losing it on me and said sorry etc etc. \n\nThat was in August.\n\nIn September he love bombed and hoovered and I said I\u2019d try If he finally agreed to see a therapist which he only agreed to because I went and got all my stuff from his place.\n\nThen we basically broke up and I left him his keys outside. He hoovered me again. I agreed to therapy which we never did because we couldn\u2019t afford it at the time.\n\nSince then I\u2019ve distanced myself from him and have not slept over his place since July. And I barely go over there. But we are \u201cofficial\u201d and \u201cin a relationship\u201c in his eyes. \n\nI\u2019m more ready than ever, we NEVER see one another or have sex. We talk everyday by text and sometimes phone. He\u2019s obsessed with still calling me his girlfriend but I don\u2019t see it that wait and it\u2019s not really and I want to just move on.\n\nI\u2019m supposed to go home with him for Christmas from Friday-Monday. I told myself to just go, thatI\u2019ve  dealt with it all this long why not 3 more days? Put it off THIS LONG why not wait til after Christmas and just go?\n\nBut I don\u2019t WANT to drive 6 hours in a car with him when we aren\u2019t really a *real* relationship that feels ok. I feel anxious around him and there\u2019s no feelings left except friendship but also resentment and damage. For whatever reason he\u2019s hung on to me tight, and I\u2019ve drifted, so we\u2019ve drifted but he hasn\u2019t ended things and I\u2019ve been terrified of the fall out for so long. I don\u2019t WANT to see his actually really sweet family and look them in the eyes and act like all is well. Like we are fine and I love their son and I\u2019m happy. I don\u2019t want to lie. I don\u2019t want to confuse him or his family by going on this trip, and then ending it when I return. \n\n\nI need advice. Do I go on this trip? It\u2019s hard for me to do something like this. I might have a panic attack in the car. Because I know in my heart I\u2019m done. And just ACT the whole time? We might even argue and 3 hours in I\u2019ll regret going or have a panic attack in the middle of nowhere. Or argue at his parents behind closed doors. Or not argue because he\u2019ll act like all is fine with his family and I\u2019m feel sick to my stomach the whole time.\n\nBut then I\u2019m not one to go back on my word. And I missed his Christmas last hear because I was grieving my dad and too depressed to go. So I\u2019ll miss two in a row. \n\nThey didn\u2019t go thanksgiving this year because their was a death in the family. He didn\u2019t come to my family thanksgiving this year (he did last year) because he doesn\u2019t have a job right now. \n\n\nI don\u2019t get why he\u2019s still with me and why he wants me to come along when we are not in a \u201creal\u201d relationship. We are codependent and how he can want em to come and act like all is great or act like all is great and normal in general when we don\u2019t actually see each other but once in a blue moon now blows my mind. And I\u2019ve tried to bring up many times now the fact that we never went to therapy is still a problem and things aren\u2019t \u201cnormal\u201d I haven\u2019t just acted like all is peachy keen and not tried to talk about things. He bulldozes over it, changes the topic, acts too offended or \u201cattacked\u201d and blatantly bulldozes over what I say. \n\nI wanna tell him I can\u2019t go. But the whole point I was going to was to not ruin his holiday, or his families. And to not go back on my word a second year in a row. The plan was to end it after he sees his family. But now he might go ape shit on me for giving some excuse as to why I cannot go.\n\nI know I dug this hole by waiting too long and waiting until some sort of holiday, AGAIN. It\u2019s not intentional. I\u2019m terrified of him and his temper and I don\u2019t know what he\u2019ll pull. I don\u2019t know how to go about this now. I do blame a lot on him but I blame this particular shitfest of a situation on ME and being too much of an effing coward to end it officially when I had so many chances before now.", "subreddit": "NarcissisticAbuse"}

So it\u2019s kind of weird finding this sub after everything in my life.  \n\nI just need to tell my story to the people here, because 1) I\u2019m still overcoming the abuse I suffered at the hands of my nex, and 2) I don\u2019t think I had ever known a community like this?? \n\nAnyway, I\u2019ve always felt like maybe *I* was exaggerating, and it wasn\u2019t abuse, it was just a shitty relationship. Even though I started seeing a psychiatrist, after a failed therapy with a psychologist, I still sometimes feel like maybe it was never a big deal. And then I end up finding this sub, at a kind of funny moment of my decade.  \n\nBut I guess I\u2019ll start my story.  \n\nAlmost ten years ago, I met my nex. I was fifteen. He is four years older than me... a close friend of mine had a crush on him, and since I was a nosy fifteen year old, I decided to check him out and see if he was any good to my friend. I don\u2019t know why I was so boy crazy back then, specially considering how aggressively bi I was... I guess I was overcompensating, ashamed I was attracted to girls. My nex was my neighbor, and I wonder if that was what made the difference for him to chose between me and my friend.  \n\nAnyway, obviously this girl and I had a fallout over him, and for the next four years and a half of our relationship I\u2019m pretty sure she was her lover. He was nineteen and we were fifteen.  \n\nI would say the honeymoon phase was the first year. \n\nHe disclosed his true self when I was in my first year of the equivalent of my country to highschool (16/17 years). I was studying in the afternoon, and for the first time I was studying at a public school. It was a good school, but there were a lot of freedoms I had never experienced before. Still, I always sticked to classes, trying to get good grades so I could switch to morning classes and spend time with my N in the afternoon. I was also implicitly prohibited from smoking and drinking without him (only the drinking, smoking was prohibited altogether).  \n\nOne day before math class a friend gave me a sip of some soda with this really cheap alcohol. Im a light weight and got tipsy during class. It was whatever and by the time my N picked me up on the bus stop near my house, I was sober, although smelly. He noticed and I panicked so hard, since the last cigarette I had he made such a big deal about. I lied and said I hadn\u2019t drink. It was just a sip.  \nA few weeks later, he is snooping around my fb on my laptop (he had it to do some homework) and saw a comment of the friend in question who gave me the sip (I think that was it; to this day I have no idea if he saw the comment, which was innocent enough, just a joke, messaged my friend and then deleted the messages or WHAT because he had a lot of details on what had been said between me and my friends). He called me in the middle of the night to break up with me because I lied, and after begging he proceeded to accept to talk to me before I went to school (midday) the next day.  \n\nI mean, I already have written a lot, so I won\u2019t write every single thing I remember from that day... i just want to share a single moment, which perfectly illustrates our relationship from that point forward.  \n\nI was crying, quite pitifully, in his room while he was laying down on his bed, when he suddenly said \u201cokay\u201d and proceeded to pull me in a tight hug. I was crying my eyes out while he stroked my back when suddenly he stiffened and ordered me to get off of him. After I did he told me \u201cjust so you know how it feels to get lied to.\u201d From that point onwards, any day I didn\u2019t felt anxiety it was a good day. He used that single event to control me for close to a year. Eventually he didn\u2019t need it anymore, I was completely under his control.  Even after I found him with the ex friend I mentioned in bed, half naked. he cried to me and i took him back. That was the first time I cut, also the first time I considered killing myself.  \n\nThere is an endless list of girls he cheated on me. A few weeks back (note: by this point it\u2019s close to five years since he dumped me) another one came forward, telling me how sorry she was (I don\u2019t get mad anymore, I just feel terrible for this girls, and I do appreciate their honesty).  \n\nI had a lot of trouble sleeping during our relationship, I was always worried he was with someone. Towards the end of our relationship, this was specially hard, since I started working on some Astronomy projects in uni, and my nights out looking at the beautiful night sky were ruined by him.  \n\nI remember one night, he went out and I stayed (like always) and I begged him to stay, that was the only way I could be certain he wasn\u2019t cheating (or so I thought). He told me to calm down and to \u201cthink of our future babies\u201d.  He used to talk so much bs about our future.  \n\nAfter he dumped me and asked to be just friends, we would meet every sunday to watch movies and talk. No kissing, no sex, just emotional support while he was dating the last girl he cheated on me with (different to my ex friend, I\u2019m sure he cheated on this new girl with my ex friend too). \n\nI at first, messily tried to move on. I remember the first time I was with someone else, this guy and I had just finished the deed when he called me, drunk, asking to stay at my place. I said no and when he asked why and I told him, he proceeded to harass me all night, calling me a Slut and telling me he never loved me. I called my best friend crying.  \n\nAfter Some months of this, I decided to become low contact with him, since by that point I was sick of being his emotional dump, but I was still hopeful on eventually being \u201cfriends\u201d. things quickly improved. I went to a different state to study for the summer.  \n\nIt had been a year since he had dumped me and I finally felt a little lighter. My best friend (the one I called) and I got drunk and ended up hooking up... it was still a bit messy, but it felt less so. He, my friend, told me he wanted to try it out with me. After thinking about it I said okay but he had to know about my sometimes messy emotional state. I told him he was my best friend, and I felt amazing with him, I didn\u2019t want to hurt him and I would always be honest with him about my Nex and my feelings. I immediately told my nex, still hopeful on being friends, that I was becoming exclusive with my friend.  \n\nAt first he seemed really supportive, but then he started sending me messages in the middle of the day, telling me he loved me and I was the love of his life. I later found out he was drunk whenever he did this, no matter the time.  \n\nI decided to become NC, although I guess it was more like extra low contact. We went to the same uni and, well... his sister was one of my closest friends. We also had several social groups in common.  \n\neventually, however, I got sick of him contacting me with romantic interest even though I had told him to stop; he was also starting to insinuate things about my boyfriend, saying he was disappointed I was a druggy now (I stopped drinking after my 19th birthday because of the panic attacks it gave me, and after turning 20 I started smoking some pot recreationally). I told him clearly to leave me alone, but he would still occasionally try to contact me.  \n\nOne time he sent me a dm on twitter demanding to know why I didn\u2019t say hi to him at a concert we both went to. I asked him if he was serious. \nI think he has only apologized to me like twice, and only for cheating and because I busted him. I also developed an ED encouraged by him. \n\nBut I don\u2019t think Ill dwell a lot more on specifics. \nI still occasionally looked him up or asked around. He dumped the girl he dumped me for to be with another girl. I think they\u2019re broken up now, because, remember my close friend from when I was fifteen? She sent me one of those \u201cyou can only see twice\u201d images on ig of the two of them A WEEK AGO. it\u2019s almost been a decade. It was random and confusing. My heart did a weird loop when I saw it. It shocks me how he can still get a reaction out of me.  \n\nIdk. I\u2019ve been doing better but this end of the decade (the last months) have been weirdly melancholic for me, remembering my younger self and how much she hurt.   \n\nLast month my cat crossed the rainbow bridge and my nex tried to use that as an excuse to talk to me. Kind of funny, considering my cat bit him. Seriously, he was the sweetest most gentle cat ever, never to intentionally hurt a person, and he bit him! Lino was so wise.  \n\nThat\u2019s another thing. My cat loved my boyfriend, my actual boyfriend, my best friend who decided to try it out with my messy butt. And he was there, holding my hand and crying while I wailed on top of my cat. He kissed Lino\u2019s face. I knew he truly loved my cat, not pretending because of me.\nIm not sure my Nex ever showed genuine kindness and/or tenderness to me, or in front of me. When one of my hs friends passed from cancer, I called him crying, and he refused to go to the service with me because it was late and he hadn\u2019t known my friend (he never knew any of my friends). \n\nI also decided to give my bf, as a birthday present, the last paw prints of Lino (the vet took them after he passed), framed. I was so anxious thinking it was such a trash gift... my nex always wanted material things (which is ok, honestly, i.e., my brother loves cash money as a gift, or games and movies, and I love making him happy), and most of my presents ended up on some corner of his room. Besides, gifts was only one of the ways I competed with other girls, with some gifting him concert tickets or the latest videogame.  \n\nWhat I\u2019m trying to say, I always thought I was a meh gifter where it counted and this year I had outdone myself with a thoughtless trash present.\nI seriously thought that, even as I was crying from remembering our cat on my way to see him; I even thought that, while he was speechless, I thought he, my bf, hated it!!!!

I\u2019ve tried CBT but it was only temporarily effective, I still get flashbacks and memories that feel like they\u2019re haunting me. But maybe telling my story and answering questions can help me things out In my head, i don\u2019t know. Maybe I just want to talk. Btw this is a throwaway, kind of. \nI was 13 and messing around on Omegle when I met a 25 year man (I\u2019ll call him Kai, not his real name), we were friends and had a lot of fun so we moved to kik. This was a time period where I had no one, I didn\u2019t get along with my family and I didn\u2019t really have any friends plus I was becoming increasingly curious about my sexuality and well sex in general. He was pretty cool and funny, we did some (naughty) things and discussed kinks/fetishes but then things got weird, he sent me images of animals he wanted me to do (naughty) things with and told me about his attraction to 10 year old boys, he liked my age too. At the time I wasn\u2019t really sure if him liking me was wrong but I knew for certain him liking little boys was, so I tried to satisfy him. Maybe if I could do it he wouldn\u2019t hurt any children or animal (I do have to preface this by saying I did nothing with anyone, it was just me). But I wasn\u2019t enough so after a while he introduced me to his 21 year old friend who I\u2019ll call Jim. Me and Jim kind of hit it off but after meeting Jim I only ever  saw or spoke to Kai once more a few months later, it was like he disappeared. After a couple days of constant chatting and some more sexual discussions Jim asked me to be his girlfriend. At first I was unsure, he was a lot older but he seemed nice so I agreed. I fell for him hard. He used to text me while driving and I\u2019d yell at him for it out of fear, I loved him and I just didn\u2019t want him hurt. The only problem was that as we got more into the relationship he wanted me to do things that I really didn\u2019t want to. Some of the things really hurt and at times I\u2019d cry, some days it was so violent I ended up with stomach pains and diarrhoea but I was so starved for affection I\u2019d do anything, if I refused than he\u2019d be angry and wouldn\u2019t speak to me. I was sooo lonely, I just wanted to be happy and loved. I hated myself, I didn\u2019t think anyone would want me because I spent my life being told I was ugly and fat. No one abuses ugly, fat people, right? So I shut up and obeyed like a dog. One day he sent me images of other girls he liked, similar ages to me, it made me jealous so I tried to do more so he wouldn\u2019t go after other prettier girls. Now I regret that, I should\u2019ve said something, I could\u2019ve helped those girls too and I didnt. It ended when I was almost 16, I was tired and began to hate him so I just told him I wanted to end it. I told him I didnt know if I loved him and deleted everything. I was terrified, he had pictures and videos of me. I have no idea what he\u2019s done with them, all I know is there\u2019s nothing I can do. I\u2019m helpless, a stupid, helpless little girl. But at least it\u2019s over. I think about it a lot, sometimes I wonder if I\u2019m like them. I\u2019m scared I\u2019m a pedophile too, but I care about kids, I want to protect them but I\u2019m scared I\u2019ll hurt them. I don\u2019t want to. I just want to move on. There are songs I can\u2019t listen to anymore because they remind me of him, I can\u2019t enjoy any form of \u201cbutt stuff\u201d because of him, my period causes anxiety because of him, I\u2019m terrified about sex and blood because of him.  But at least it\u2019s over. I only realised what happened was wrong after a play came to my high school that was about sexual abuse and the situation shown was so similar to mine that I went stiff like a board.

When I got out I was going to go to a treatment center. He was going to go with me. Until he just list his shit. Luckily my friends gathered around me and wouldn't let him touch me. He ended up going to jail for unrelated situation. He's there now. By the time he gets out I will be in treatment. Dual diagnosis. Hopefully for 3 months. Because if he was out of jail right now, I would be with him. And I know how fucking insane that is. I absolutely know that a sane person would run from this guy. But fuck. I love him. I wonder how violence can be attributed to meth?  And I was nuts with some of my fucking up meth induced thinking. Maybe I was fucking with him without realizing. Still, he shouldn't have put his hands on me. And after he tried to kill me? If we would get in an argument he would make me do stupid shit to prove he had power over me. Put gloves on or pick sunglasses up from the ground. Just because he knew I had to do whatever he said. He took my power away then flaunted it. He pulled my pants down and told me he will fuck me in the ass and I will pretend I like it. He didn't actually do that but he wanted me to know he could. He took my power away. My trust. Almost my future. So why can't I let him go? I'm so glad he's in jail. I'm so glad I'm finally getting into treatment. Because I am too sick to make any decisions for myself. I don't want to get a protection oder because I feel like once he's off meth, he won't be that violent person. And he swears he's going to treatment after jail, although Im.not checking on any of that. I don't care what he does because I need to concentrate I n me. I just keep hoping that in treatment there will be people to help me figure it our to some degree. Right? I mean, right? I don't even trust myself anymore. I'm asking strangers on reddit fir help. Because I know the right answer but I can't seem to let him go. \nSo my questions are\n1. How much of the violence can I associate with meth? \n2. Is there any hope?  Not even for our relationship exactly. Hope for him to become a better man in general. With treatment and serious therapy?", "subreddit": "survivorsofabuse"}

He not picked me saying I\u2019d have nothing in life and he\u2019d have everything and he would feel bad for me. He said he needed to be hard on me because life gets hard.

It wasn\u2019t just paranoia. He even said he\u2019d still have love for me just like he still does for his ex.

But I told him it\u2019s too early to tell. He was worried about how people viewed him, us as a couple his family more than the relationship. \n\nHe was slowly driving me crazy and he was acting so unreasonable. \n\nAll of this love bombing, the effort and attention at first then the comparisons and rushing and controlling behavior and then the whirlwind of that break up and rebound to his ex is all just nuts.

This realization is SO NEW like literally it was JUST triggered 5 minutes ago because I was finishing up ahem...using the bathroom.\n\nThe reason I was triggered is because, he would constantly tell me when he was using the bathroom as in going number 2. Or if he was sweaty in the summer. Or that he hadn't showered. \n\nAt first this seemed to be a gross \"dude bro/jock/obnoxious\" trait that some men have. But its actually more sinister than that.\n\nAt first when I met him, when we were together in a hotel or bed and breakfast or restaurant or whatever. I would just walk over to the bathroom or say \"I have to use the bathroom\". He would do and say the same. Later on (months and up to a year later) my bathroom etiquette stayed the same while his just became more and more gross. He would announce \"I gotta go take a shit, Ill be right back\" or \"Damn I gotta shit, I ate xyz\" while in the relationshit (no pun intended) I thought this was just him loosening up (again no pun intended) and becoming more comfortable and chill around me ya know like treating me like one of the guys. But no, he was just intentionally being disgusting and literally the piece of shit that he is. \n\nI would joke with him about how often he used the bathroom (going number 2) like it became an inside joke. This enabled him to continue to cross my boundaries in this way. He went as far as telling me that he kept washcloths in his bag so that when he had to use the bathroom in public he could wipe properly and that he threw them in the public trash bins with poop still on them. He just was really disgustingly descriptive about it and always felt the need to tell me. I dont know why I entertained that disgusting ongoing conversation with him. I think I thought it was endearing (I KNOW!!) Fucking gross!\n\nAs for the sweatyness and shower details. He would say things like \"I'm so sweaty, I stink I need to take a shower\" at first then that evolved to him just saying \"ughhh my balls stink, Im so sweaty\". Once after we went for walk I was kissing up on him and trying to initiate sex and he said \"ughhh why are you kissing me when Im so sweaty my balls stink, you want these sweaty balls?\"\n\nHe would randomly mention that he didn't shower or stunk or was smelling sweaty. Just announce it like fucking dinner. \n\nThis form of boundary crossing and disrespect is so subtle that it can be written off as disgusting bro speak but it isnt, its abusive.\n\nThat whole if he treats you like one of the boys trope throw that out with the trash. Your man needs to treat you like a fucking lady/with respect!  please if anyone relates let me know.", "subreddit": "NarcissisticAbuse"}

{"post_id": "eg0zlv", "created_utc": 1577394403, "title": "Possible Narc?", "author": "KiiDBlaze", "self_text": "As with (well hopefully I\u2019m not alone) many people, my journey into narcissism land started with freaking out that I might be a narcissist. I have ADD, so some narcissistic tendencies seem inherently an issue: and really after noticing similarities and doing research, apparently the comorbidity of narcissism and ADHD is high. The only reason I take an oz of comfort ruling myself out is my closest friends from HS reassuring me. I\u2019ve noticed a lot of similar patterns between narcissism and other fields of research, but this is where the real life application gets difficult for me. I began getting paranoid everyone was a narcissist and I\u2019ve realized somewhere along the way I forgot what setting boundaries was and how to be my own person, I actually don\u2019t know if I ever really had boundaries. Not having boundaries feels like training the people around you to treat you like a narcissist would, so I\u2019ve been trying to keep my sanity and reality in check and just start with setting boundaries when I can.\n\nAnyways, onto the point, I\u2019ve started realizing over the last couple months that one of my close friends (has ADHD, in fact was one of the things we initially bonded over) for about a year, as well as one of the mutual friends he introduced me to that he\u2019s really close to, is...well, c/overtly narcissistic? *sigh* This is gonna be messy, I don\u2019t even know where to start. I\u2019ve only started consciously picking up things recently, I\u2019ve been so trusting and close for so long that I\u2019m still not even 100% sure what the reality with him is and the more I think this out the more I\u2019m gonna find more in my memory that fits the pattern so here we go.\n\nA distinct example I can\u2019t let go of (gaslighting?): one time we were hanging out, watching a tv show and I\u2019d said something casually in response or he\u2019d said something and essentially we\u2019d disagreed about it. A few minutes later into the episode, after the moment had passed, the show revealed I\u2019d be correct and he said \u201csee I told you!\u201d and it really took me a second to look at him and realize \u201cNo, I told you that a few minutes ago when you argued?\u201d and he sat there smirking at first, didn\u2019t respond to it and instead changed the subject.\n\nAnother thing that\u2019s been bothering me, I\u2019ve noticed there were several times in which I\u2019d chosen to be generous with something and 1 on 1, several times, he said \u201cThanks, I notice when my friends are generous\u201d and other random bullshit along those lines, and it always rubbed me the wrong way and felt weird...especially because as a person I\u2019ve noticed he\u2019s really generally stingy and self-serving, and it was because of his own assbackwards talking I realized I was being far more generous than he deserved and that maybe my care for him was clouding what I was piecing together.\n\nHe has an extremely weird history with all of his exes, and my friend is dating a VERY overt narcissist that also has a weird pattern with his exes, and she told me about how he dotes &amp; secretly likes all of them still and apparently he told her something along those lines and it\u2019s all veryyyy fucked up (not gonna go into her business) and he has an EXTREMELY specific set of kink preferences.....jump back to my narc friend, he\u2019s very much the same way. He says \u201cI would never get back together with my exes\u201d, he usually has SOMETHING (-) to say about them, and quite frequently talks about ex relationship as if he was blameless and all their issues were revolving around his ex. The moment an ex reaches out to him though, he starts going back and forth with whoever he\u2019s dating and often comes to me for advice. If he\u2019s not super \u201cofficial\u201d in his eyes with his current boyf, I\u2019ve seen him lowkey cheat WITH HIS EX and say it\u2019s nbd. I feel like I watched his seemingly good ex (the only person I\u2019ve seen him date that made any sense) realize he\u2019s toxic and breakup, and just like all narc warnings \u201che has someone backup\u201d and he\u2019s always on top of SOMEONE even if he says \u201cI\u2019m chilling \u201csingle\u201d rn\u201d bitch no, you\u2019re uncommitted to the relationship you\u2019re in, sure, but you\u2019re not single.\n\nI\u2019ve noticed...what I think is a pattern of subtle psychological conditioning? He sends me sexual memes when he wants something and sends me his normal drug related or other memes anytime else. \ud83d\ude43 Ig I\u2019ll lyk if that pattern breaks.\n\nIt all bothers me, I\u2019ve already distanced myself from his friend (another 10k word story) and almost completely stopped associating with him and I\u2019ve been feeling better. Actually, after something happened between us there was 2 times I showed up at a mutual friend\u2019s where he was and within 15 minutes he left both times. Didn\u2019t see him for a month or two and finally now if we both end up at a mutual\u2019s he doesn\u2019t just bounce.\n\nI feel like I\u2019m going crazy and anytime I try to explain this to one of my best friends, she\u2019s met him and doesn\u2019t see it, she blindly loves him like I had. On the other hand, my other best friend, who I KNOW has a narcissistic dad and knows the physical, mental, and emotional abuse and toll it takes. She\u2019s always been critical of my other friends and had admitted that in some part she knows she selfishly doesn\u2019t want me to have too many friends/(friendquaintances) for worry that I wont have time with her and I know there\u2019s some truth to it, but I also know she cares and we have talked about it slightly but she usually gets annoyed: especially because she\u2019s already established she didn\u2019t love meeting him and doesn\u2019t think he\u2019s a good influence. I suspect/know this attributes to the fact that she has a hard time having a serious conversation with me about this when I need it.\n\nI don\u2019t know what I\u2019m supposed to do about everything I\u2019m noticing, I feel like everytime I hang out with him I get sucked back in and I become a different person than I am otherwise, I weirdly don\u2019t know how to be around him. Being around him feels weird and I can\u2019t shake that, and I\u2019ve realized the feeling never changed: it\u2019s been the same since day one. I initially took it a feeling of attraction, and I feel like I\u2019ve been trapped in a cycle of it. The more I recognize the tricks and the games though, the less hold that cycle has had on me: however I still find myself somewhat immobilized around him.\n\nIdk, I could go on and on, Ig the worst part has been feeling like I\u2019m the only one that\u2019s seeing the shitstorm and like I\u2019m the town crazy guy that\u2019s missing a few screws up there or something if I say something, even to the person(s) I feel like I should be able to express all of this to.", "subreddit": "NarcissisticAbuse"}

Over a year later, it is causing me more trouble and depression than ever and I'm not sure how to deal with it.\n\nI'm a 20yr old woman. I was friends with a guy for many years, let's call him Jim. We met when we were 16 at a party and it was clear that he liked me. I was never interested, but I saw him frequently because we were in the same friendship group. He made a strong effort to become one of my best friends over the years and he was a great friend and listener. It only got awkward when he was really drunk, like at parties-  he would hit on me, tell me he was in love with me and ask me out. I often debated if I should stay friends with him because I didn't want to seem like I was leading him on. We stayed friends but I reduced interactions with him by the time I was 18.\n\nJust before I went to university I broke up with my boyfriend at the time. Jim started messaging me and to be honest, I liked the attention.  After a month (October 2018) I decided I would go visit him at his university because I thought I might be into him, although I wasn't sure. We went out clubbing and both got a bit drunk, though he was far worse than me (I was being careful not to get too drunk on purpose). We made out at the club and then went back to his. I made it clear that I didn't want to have sex with him but we tried hand stuff- it was bad and he was too drunk to get it up though so we stopped and I went to sleep. I woke up because I felt him touching my boobs under my shirt and trying to put his hand down my pants. I then realised he was wanking. He tried to grab my hand and put it on his penis but I pulled away. This happened again and I moved to the other side of the bed. Neither of us said anything but he then stopped. At the time all I felt was tired-ness and confusion so I went back to sleep. The next day I felt very uneasy but neither of us said anything about what had happened so we carried on like things were normal, having breakfast and going for a walk. I left earlier than planned because I felt uncomfortable. On the train back, I messaged him and told him I had a great time (although that was not true) but that I was sorry because I was not interested in him. He was angry at me for leading him on and at the time I felt very guilty. When I described to my friends at university what had happened, they thought it was funny so from then on I always told the story as if it were a comedy. In my mind I justified Jim's actions by thinking that he was either too drunk to remember or that he knew what had happened and was too regretful/ embarrassed to discuss it.\n\nWe stopped talking for a while until December 2018. Again, he was very drunk and messaged me asking if we could be friends again because he missed me. I agreed because I felt that if I didn't, social situations would be made difficult because we had the same friends at home. I only ever told one of my close friends from that friendship group what had happened at the time (let's call her Jane) because for some reason I didn't want them to dislike him; looking back on it now, I realise that really I was scared that they would disbelieve/ dislike me as it was an almost entirely male friendship group aside from myself and Jane. Things continued as normal and I don't remember ever thinking about the whole scenario at that time, except to make jokes about it with my university friends.\n\nIn the summer of 2019, I was at a party that Jim crashed (he was not invited as he had a tendency to cause a lot of drama and as a result had fallen out with a number of people). At that party, he got very drunk and got into one of his mean moods (these were very common when he got drunk). Throughout the party he kept telling people that I had broken his heart and that I was a bitch. The final straw was when in a game of 'Never have I ever' (which I was not participating in but I was instead nearby) he said 'never have I ever pretended to sleep while someone wanked over me'. I immediately left without saying anything and only myself and Jane had heard what he said. She came after me and I told her that I never wanted to speak to Jim again. I had finally snapped out of protecting him and instead realised that what he had done was very wrong and not only that he remembered what happened, but that he was proud of it and believed that I deserved it. This last part was proven when Jane went to tell him to apologise to me and he said 'she deserves all of it, she's a bitch for breaking my heart'. I went back to university and tried to forget about the whole thing. I also found out that he had told people that I had 'blue-balled' him so he had to wank, although he didn't mention that he touched me at all.\n\nAs the Christmas holidays approached I felt a small amount of dread knowing that I would have to be in social situations with Jim, but I stuck to my policy of not speaking to or even acknowledging him. This worked for two outings although it was a little awkward at times. On Christmas Eve, I was having a great night and around 15 of my friends came so it made it easy to avoid Jim. However, at around 12:30 as people began to leave a very drunk (and allegedly on ketamine) Jim came up to me. He was very awkward and rambled a bit but essentially said 'how is everything with you'. I replied 'I don't want to talk to you, especially not while you're drunk'. I then went outside to the smoking area with a few of my (male) friends. They asked me why I wouldn't speak to him and I quickly told them what happened the night I visited him. They agreed it was disgusting but then he approached our group. I quickly walked away to a nearby table with one of my friends (let's call him Joel). I then hear Jim yelling 'she came to my house, she wanted it' (I do not know what they said to trigger this but it was clear what he was referring to). This sent me into a blind rage and a ran at him and yelled in his face saying 'someone can't consent while they're asleep, going to someone's house is not consent'. My friends and the people around seemed very taken aback and Joel dragged me away. I then explained the whole situation to Joel and he walked me home. He was very comforting but pointed out that no-one could ever be 100% sure if I was telling the truth or not so people, like my friends, would probably want to stay out of it rather than end their friendship with Jim even though there is plenty of evidence that he is a bad person. That night, Christmas morning, I cried until 4am. I woke up at around 9am and cried for a bit more. I felt like utter shit. I felt better throughout the day and today but still retain a sense of dread because I don't know how to move forward with any of my friends.\n\nI hate that this affects my life. I've shied away from being a victim for so long because it's not want I want people to think when they see me. I just want this all to go away but Jim just won't leave it.

I may have been abused but others had it much worse.\n\nBut over the last 6 years, my mother has been dating and is currently considering marrying a man who has emotionally abused me and I am still coming to terms with this fact.\n\nBut I will cover him later because before him there was another. I was around 8-11? ish I'm not really exactly sure of my age because a lot of things around this time are, for lack of a better word, blurry in my head.the earliest memory that I have of him abusing me was small things, yelling at me for small things, like being sick or taking to long to do my chores, this slowly got worse over time, during this, there was an event at some point which is vivid in my head of standing in a corner for multiple hours. from what I remember I was made to stand in the corner from when I woke up until I went to bed. it continued to get worse from here, the next events I remember were him making fun of me for playing games instead of making friends.\n\nAfter this the next really big thing was he threw me off of a boat (i think it was a paddleboat? I don't know but I remember it being small) things kind of go blank here for a bit but the only other thing I remember is that he hit me with a tire iron. during the years that my mother dated this man, she never acknowledged that any of this going on. my memory goes blank for a bit here but I remember them breaking up? I'm not sure what it was about but I'm pretty sure that we didn't move but I do remember that even tho they had broken up that he still came over to \"hang out\".\n\nShortly after this my mother met and started dating the man that she is still dating to this day, and she is planning to marry him soon. now my memory is better here as this is relatively recent so there will be more detail in some things, and less in others as some have extremely personal details but I will try to give a good overview of events.\n\nNow things were alright for a while but after about a year things started going downhill, he would frequently over-punish me for things that I did wrong, so things like not doing chores properly the first time, not spending enough time with my sister, he was in a bad mood in general, etc, etc. now don't get me wrong he was nice, he bought me things took us places and what not but it got to the point that I actually had panic attacks later in life when he was coming home and I knew that I missed something or he was in a bad mood.it still wasn't too bad but there were still things like blatant favoritism to my sister and the worst was around this time the touching started.\n\nIt started small, as all things do hugs that lasted to long, kisses that were a touch to intimate for a parent things like that.but it got worse over time hugs graduated to grabbing my ass and when I started gaining weight due to my depression and whatnot, he began grabbing my boobs (which I was extremely sensitive about) I've seen his junk dozens of times and his ass more than that. I have told him hundreds of times to stop. when I told my mother about it she simply laughed it off and told me he was just being silly he has never attempted anything more but I don't like to be home alone with him because he gets worse.\n\nHe would have meltdowns and scream and throw things and threaten to kill us, to this day I cannot stand people yelling, and I will completely shut down if someone yells at me. my mother played it off as him having a \"bad day\".\n\nHe would belittle me and call me names call me fat, call me ugly, call me retarded, etc. \n\nThey fed me racist lies that I still struggle to deal with but I am getting much better about it.\n\nFor around 4 years I did not have a bedroom, from the age of 13 to 16 I slept in the living room\n\nThey would sell my things to pawn shops to fund their weed addiction\n\nI was the only one who did chores (i know this doesn't seem that big but I meant all the chores besides cooking I mean dishes, floors, general house cleaning, the yard, laundry my parents did nothing but work cook smoke and drink)\n\nThere have been multiple occasions where at the age between 13 to 18 where I would have to babysit my drunk/high parents\n\nAnd the list continues far more than I can fit in a single post. \n\nBut It really got horrible when I came out as gay to my parents\n\nnow up to this point everything while upsetting was tolerable but after this? it got ten times worse my father went from being an asshole to being intolerable. they made jokes about me 24/7 even in public. called me even worse names my father refused to accept it and my mother cried. \n\nat this point due to the bullying at school and at home at the age of 15, I attempted suicide for the first time.\n\nthey still don't know and I will never tell them\n\nnobody ever noticed\n\nit got worse \n\nI went into homeschooling shortly after this, at this point we had moved 5 times in under 4 years, I will take responsibility here I didn't do any work I did about 1/2 a years work in about 2 years and thus I fell behind well after this I decided that I wanted to go back to public school because I figured I could finish school and start the life I didn't. I had no push and no drive so when my mother told me that I didn't have to go to school I didn't and when she told me to drop out I did so happily. I believed my mother was always right, mother knows best and whatnot.\n\nwhen my mother told me to stop taking my meds because the doctor was trying to poison my mind I listened.\n\nthis continued\n\nat 17 I attempted suicide again\n\nyet again no one noticed and no one cared\n\nthis behavior continued until they forced me to move with them to Virginia, it didn't go well as we moved back down less than 2 months later leaving us essentially homeless. at some point, I went to my friends for a party, and I never came home.\n\nit has taken a lot of self-reflection and help from other members of my family and friends to realize that my parents were even doing things wrong and that it wasn't me.\n\nso let me know Reddit am I the asshole for hating my parents?", "subreddit": "emotionalabuse"}

I grew up with my cousins,-they always lived down the street and we were all so close we were practically siblings. My cousin (M) who was 3 years older, would sneak into my room when everyone went to bed and would touch me. He would make me touch him.  I don\u2019t remember if rape actually occurred, I just remember the forced touching. I would always pretend to be asleep because I was so scared. And then when he was done he would leave the room and all would go back to normal. This continued throughout middle school and then finally the family moved away. I must have suppressed this memory because I don\u2019t remember it ever bothering me in high school. \n\nThe next time was at a party in high school. Alcohol was involved, but I was sober- pretending to look \u201ccool\u201d. We were in the back of a truck and 3 boys forced me to touch them with my hands and mouth thinking it was a game and saying it\u2019s okay because I would remember. I was afraid to fight back because we were camping in the woods and thought Things could get worse if I didn\u2019t play along. \n\nThe last time was the night of senior prom. The night that was supposed to be the funnest of all 4 years. I spent it with friends and the night went perfect. We got permission to spend the night at a chaperoned house where we were allowed to drink safely as we were all spending the night. I drank to much and went to the bathroom to puke. He came in- this guy who I thought was such a good friend- and at first he held my hot back as I puked. I thank him. Then the next thing I knew his pants were unzipped and he forced himself into my mouth. I kept telling him no and forcing him out but he didn\u2019t stop. When we was done he told me he hoped I wouldn\u2019t ruin the whole night but telling everyone what we did- we were such good friends after all. \n\nI\u2019ve considered myself a very strong person who has had a very good life. I definitely suppressed these memories and almost forgot about them entirely. My cousin has been dead for years, and I\u2019m no longer in touch with any of the others  but for some reason these have all come back up and started bothering me. Like losing sleep over it now. I\u2019m 26 years old. It has been so long and it\u2019s just now bothering me.  \n\nDoes anyone know why? Has this ever happened to anyone ?

I know this time can be tough for us - it certainly is for me. \nFigured I\u2019d share a story of the best Christmas\u2019s present I could have received with you all in the hopes it brightens some of your days. \n\nQuick background: was married to n for 16 years.  The abuse was typical. 3 years ago I left my home town and moved to her country around the world.  \n2 years into it I had to close my successful business and became financially dependent.  Within a year the discard happened. I was arrested on bogus abuse charges and spent a night in jail.  I saw my son and daughter on his birthday and was again arrested - this time for a bogus charge of abusing the kids. My bail prevented me from seeing them. I was suddenly homeless with no money as she emptied the joint accounts.  We were both very high earners. Her business earned 250k. Mine was 100k of passive income. I was the stay at home dad.  \n\nI had to go through supervised access and had the worst first session without the kids. The therapist completely bought her story. He was aggressive and insulting. I cried after the meeting. \nAfter 6 weeks his program ended and he shook my hand saying I was the best parent he had ever seen in his program. \n\nI was cleared for unsupervised access and Christmas Eve was my first day.  Nex and her solicitor tried to tell me I had to stay at a designated exchange  location with the kids and nex supervising. \nThey sent this email after my solicitor was closed for the holidays.  \nI was pre law in college.  I can read a contract. The court order did not express or imply this. \n\nI went to the police and informed them they were going to be hearing from me and her at the drop off time. I showed them the court order as well as photos I have of bruises and scratches from her abuse. \n\nI meet with the kids load them in my car and she and her flying monkey parents coordinated  following me. I drove to the police station. Reported her parents for harassment as they were following me. I took video of it. \n\nI get back in car with kids. Leave and nex starts tailing me. It was like a scene from a film. I drive back to police station and report her for following me.  When I arrive the officer has to call district to cancel the missing persons report. Yes she reported me for kidnapping!  He basically tells her to fuck off.  I got to take my kids to my new house I\u2019m renting and have a brief Christmas with my visiting family. Presents were opened, it was great.  \n\nAt drop off nex was livid. She became aggressive, tried to spin it like I was being aggressive as I just stood there. \n\nI reported her aggressive behavior, and a different officer took the report.  As I walked in to the station he knew my name and recognised me. I\u2019m still on bail for the original charges and have a pending criminal case.  The police did not want to prosecute but nex is insisting.  Fuck. \n\nI apologised for reporting such a small thing to him and wasting their time. He said it was important I do. It creates a pattern of behavior. He said \u201cMan to man, I know we just brush these things off and move on\u201d\n\u201cA lot of us are on your side, and by a lot of us I mean basically everyone\u201d \n\u201cThe orders from district are to basically check to see if you are ok if she reports anything\u201d \n\nI was almost in tears.  He shook my hand. I\u2019m pretty sure I\u2019ll be found not guilty, of the criminal charges at this point. We have the same judge for our access as my criminal judge.  He doesn\u2019t take any shit.  The report of kidnapping for taking up access that he ordered might tip this all in my favor. \n\nHappy Christmas / and other holidays you might celebrate.

To me this is a very immature way of relating to an issue that could be easily solved if he would just let go of the notion that his intentions are always good and actually look at the behaviour that I'm describing.\nI've tried to express that but again nothing has ever changed.\n\nTo him, it's such a far fetched thought that despite his good intentions, he still has a habit of making me feel like shit because he's never bothered to change the vocabulary he uses or to try and change how he relates to my issues with him. \n\nThat said I also have a bad habit of being triggered in situations like this and displaying my emotions which, to him is just more ammunition for him to blame our argument on my inability to control my bipolar moods.\nThe fact is, he knows just how much this hurts me, but in any given situation where he has messed up, he still does this because it's easier than saying \"I'm sorry I made a poor choice and I can see that I've hurt you\"\n\nIt's difficult because I know that this condition effects him too. There are absolutely some days where I feel overwhelmed and don't cope well but I have strategies for dealing with this and just generally avoid him when I'm like this. Mainly because he doesn't help, but also because now I constantly feel paranoid that of I slip up and snap, he'll just use it against me in the future. This makes me feel very alone but it's fine.\n\nI'm high functioning and get a lot of support. I live in supported accommodation with mental health nurses who I speak to weekly, I go to therapy once a month and I have never felt healthier in my life. I'm really proud of how far I've come in terms of managing this condition yet somehow this relationship keeps convincing me that im still the same out of control messed up teenager that I was pre-diagnosis.\n\nIf anything that's the real reason I feel the need to get out. I need to start believing that I'm better and I can't when he keeps trying to convince me that I'm sick because it's easier to say that than to admit that maybe he's the one who is sick?", "subreddit": "abuse"}

When the person can tell what you are thinking from across a crowded room it feels like a powerful thing. But once you are convinced they know parts of you no one else will ever understand that leaves a lot of room for them to slowly make you believe the things they say about you. When they point out issues or your quirks and paint them in a not so forgiving way you take those opinions to heart and say \u201che/she is the only one who really gets me so if they are saying these things then they must be true and i need to fix that\u201d. And that\u2019s how they are able to get you to believe anything about yourself and it creates this uneven level of power. You are less than and become dependent on their evaluations of yourself bc you start to question the things you used to think you knew and valued about yourself.

I went to see my father on christmas Eve. I hadn't seen him in a year, my mother and him are going through a contentious divorce, my mother has turned everyone against him, and has put him down for 15 years, about him having drinking issues etc... I went to see him and the things he said really threw me for a loop, because I always felt bad for my mom. He said how she was emotionally abusive towards him, he believes she drove him to drunk heavily, because of all her put downs, I started thinking of all the times she did and said nasty things to me, all the times she made me cry that I pushed aside, and how she has never once apologized for hurting me etc...\n\nI agree with her that the he dealt with the divorce so far by starting it without telling anyone, and not seeing his kids or telling us was terrible, but also since meeting him I can see that maybe he did feel abused by her. I wish he kept in contact with his kids, he said the reason he did not was out of fear of what we might tell her and what she could twist. Anyway to get to the main point. I told my mom afterwards how it went, and she seemed so angry how happy he was doing without her. I felt emotionally drained from seeing him, because it had been so long, I slept in really late on Christmas Day. When  I got up my mom had everything done for Christmas dinner, there was nothing for me to do. She was giving me stern looks, angry looks, dirty looks etc... It was very intimidating. She told me to take the long face off and put a smile on my face, that I was ruining christmas. I asked my other siblings that I wonder what our father is doing, my sister screamed she didn't want to talk about him. My mother snipes \" Why don't you do live with him\" She then gets up and runs away crying. \n\nMy siblings blame me for the fact she is upset and say I ruined Xmas. I felt I did nothing wrong, and couldn't understand why I was being painted as the bad guy. I end up going back to sleep after dinner, I was miserable, and didn't want to stay where I felt uncomfortable, I felt depressed, and just wanted to forget my life. I wake up and my sister tells me the reason she moved out was because of my moods, and blames me for the fact she moved out, I never did or said anything to her, and have always minded my own business, anyone else outside this \"family\" doesn't have a problem with me, and I'm the same with everyone. My brother gets on her bandwagon and starts saying to me while I'm sitting there minding my own business, he says something I respond, in an angry tone goes \" God your mood again\" I said I responded to what your saying normally, what are you talking about, everything I say or do is nitpicked, it's so weird. My moods are normal, I feel miserable though, other than being upset and crying to myself sometimes, I do nothing to anyone. Maybe they do this on purpose to bully me? It's starting to feel like that. My mother has been totally shunning me, until I broke the ice today, I asked her if she was jealous I spent time with my father, she said no, she was annoyed that I ruined Christmas Day, that I did nothing, I contributed nothing, again trying to make me feel small and crap. For the first time I didn't back down, I stood up to her, and said actually you made a really nasty comment, and ran off crying making it all about you. You ruined Christmas, and you always make everything about your feelings, I am sick of it. I could see her blood boiling and made a get away, she follows me up the stairs, screaming get back here right now, what the hell is that supposed to mean? I feel intimidated and scared. I tell her to leave me alone or I will start recording her, that threat worked, there is still massive tension which I was trying to deal with by bringing up her nasty comment hoping she would apologize, but instead she now is making me the bad guy even worse than before. \n\nI haven't seen this side of her for such a long time, because I always do everything to appease her and never get on the wrong side of her, but now I can see why I do that, she has this terrifying side to her, when you step out of how your \"supposed \" To behave or react, she tries to put you back in your box. I am wondering how do I handle this until I move out? I am going to be taking steps next year to get a job, and stop being under her thumb, because I am miserable. Whenever they do anything to upset me, instead of apologizing, they use the fact I'm in my room staying away from them, saying they feel they have to walk on eggshells around me etc... Everything is turned so that I am always to blame, even me being in my room is turned into something. Please some comments of support and advice would be great.", "subreddit": "abuse"}

It was perfect in the beginning, like we could tell each other anything and will support one another no matter what. Eventually, however, the situation had become unbearable for me. I would have to listen to them talk behind each other's backs and I had called out that behaviour as something petty that I didn't want to be a part of, and I felt like I was constantly on trial for my opinions on political issues (I'm left-wing, but apparently not enough for a couple of them).\n\nBasically, I was the judgy one when it came to \"first world problems\", while two of them acted compassionate and open-minded but had zero tolerance for \"bigotry\" and \"insensitivity\", as they called it, in those they had around (sometimes people in the group, too). From the outside looking in, I was under the impression that they could be very cunningly CRUEL. \n\nI had recurring panic-attacks during that time (haven't had one in the past 5 months!), but the way I was discarded by them was really hurtful and still causes me relationship issues. It left me doubting that I or they may be narcissistic. This is what happened:\n\nafter enduring a lot of passive-aggressive tantrums from those two friends, I had a lot of pent-up emotions. \nI made the mistake of talking to one of them about the other, behind their back.\nI learned that they had talked about it because both of them grew more and more visibly resentful, but would not address the problem, so I pretended like I did not notice. \nWhen I got drunk one day and couldn't take it anymore, I exited our group chat (there were 7 of us in it, but I just couldn't stand being associated with those two in any way and I felt like I had to redefine the relationship according to new terms that I, too, would be comfortable with). \nWhen we met to talk about this - I asked to do it, they had simply stopped talking to me - they told me I was projecting everything, since I had been the one to talk behind their backs and I was the one throwing tantrums (like when I exited the chat).\n\nThey were so convincing that I initially believed them and started thinking I am a narcissist, I am dramatic, I am going crazy, I am seeing things and I did this to myself.\n\nThe way they behaved towards me is exactly what you would do with a narc: I was left alone at 2 am in a town that was far from my home, so I had to find myself a hotel because they COLLECTIVELY (the WHOLE group) went no-contact with me. \nThey maintained it up until recently, when some of them reached out to me to catch up with how I've been doing (not that couple, though) but it still gives me anxiety to talk to any of them. And it sucks. I don't know what they think of me at all, and I can't speak to them about any of this. \n\nI don't want validation, I don't want someone to tell me I was a victim. All I want is closure. Is this behaviour in line with what you would expect from people with narcissistic tendencies? Am I the one who sounds more manipulative?

My parents decided they didn't want anyone outside of the immediate family to be told the real reason for his arrest and asked that I keep my story a secret. I have complied. They were angry with my decision to cut him from my life and tried to bully me into reversing myself on that many times, but this is where I've drawn a hard line.\n\nSo over the years, some of the extended family has realized I don't associate with my brother, some of them haven't noticed at all and haven't been told a single thing about it. A rumor spread around for a while that his jail time was for statutory rape of a high school girlfriend after he turned 18 and her parents got mad.\n\nThat's been my family climate over the last 17 years. I've had relatives ask me how he was doing, I have no idea. I had to sit and listen to him, in his Best Man speech at our other brother's wedding, talk about how easy my childhood was compared to his. I \"had such an easy time making friends.\" I had backed out of being a bridesmaid (brother was marrying my childhood best friend) specifically because I was afraid of moments like that. I went home that night and drank a bottle of wine.\n\nAt the family Christmas party this year [brother not present; with the exception of our other brother's wedding, I do not attend family functions if he's going to be there], two of my aunts backed me into a discussion of how important family is, and siblings are all you have left when your parents die, and whatever happened between us I should really just let it go and make peace. I nearly had a breakdown in the middle of the party, but my husband got me out of there.\n\nSo I've thought about it, a lot, and I've come to the decision that I've tried it my parents' way for 17 years, but it's just not working for me anymore. I don't think it ever was. I think I was mainly pressured to keep quiet to protect *his* relationships and future, but all it has brought me is pain. I almost told my aunts everything, then and there, but they were slightly tipsy and then a non-family party guest interrupted us and I realized it wasn't the time or place.\n\nWith that in mind, I've written a letter, to all my extended family. I fully intend to sit on it a while, make sure it is exactly what I want, give it deep and meaningful consideration. I've had some of my closest friends and my husband review it and have gotten positive feedback. And now I thought, why not see what r/survivorsofabuse has to say. So [here's the letter](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1q_EXOLv2mhSDbkQTsODgSE_Jp9OXns4krlbGcK3tpe0/edit?usp=drivesdk), in all its glory, have at it!

I\u2019d say on the scale of normal person to extreme narcissist he might be a 4 out of 10, or a 5. \n\nHe\u2019s an absolutely amazing guy who I love, but I think his very difficult upbringing affected him and I think that\u2019s where his narcissism stems from. \n\nHe\u2019s got the usual behaviors like ignoring me for days when angry, not being able to handle his ego being insulted, needing emotional revenge when hurt, and I feel like he also sees himself as superior to many people and most definitely never thinks he is in the wrong. He\u2019s very stubborn. Verbally abusive when angry.\n\nThese behaviors are really crappy to deal with, but they only surface when we argue and he isn\u2019t someone who makes my life miserable, or anything like that. He\u2019s amazing until he\u2019s mad, which happens when he feels emotionally hurt, or when he feels like I am trying to \u2018start drama\u2019 with him, or when he feels like he\u2019s threatened. \n\nThe things that have seriously set him off are : \n- me threatening to leave him if he doesn\u2019t change the way he speaks to me. He was very angry that I brought this up on a normal day when he had done nothing wrong, felt very attacked, and was clear he felt a huge amount of emotional pain from me threatening to ditch him \n- me calling him out on xyz things that he would do that we\u2019re wrong. He gets very angry when I bring these things up on good days when everything between us was normal. He sees this as me starting drama. I\u2019ve done this very rarely and only for situations that were very serious and not acceptable for me to deal with \n\nIt\u2019s clear to me that he has an insanely short fuse and can not handle the avalanche of anger and pain that gets tapped into when we have an argument. For him, his biggest trigger is having that dark hurricane tapped into because I don\u2019t think he can control how he feels, and it\u2019s truly like you set loose an avalanche on somebody, or set a bomb off for him internally, and his biggest anger is when according to him, I rock the boat and put him through that when I know that he just needs peace. \n\nwhen we do get into fights his behavior and emotional abuse is crazy. \n\nThis person deserves to be loved because I don\u2019t think this is something he sees about himself or can even control. I\u2019m posting here because I want to know, how can you best love a narcissist and help them heal and be the best second half for them? \n\nHe\u2019s an amazing guy, who deals with some crazy shit inside.

Apparently this creates the illusion that the love bomber is really into the recipient of all this attention and creates a false sense of excitement, hope, and intimacy in the mind of the victim. My question is: wouldn't all this attention all at once without really knowing the person seem weird or odd to the recipient? Like, if a man and a woman met and exchanged phone numbers, maybe went on one date, and then he began texting her non-stop, wouldn't she just think that he was nuts?  \n\nMaybe I'm misunderstanding the concept though.

She spent a large chunk of our appointment going over forms and talking about what she does in her sessions. When I asked for a copy of the forms she said I could read them now, and I said I really wanted to talk since we didn't have much more time. I get that it's the first appointment and maybe I'm just not used to paying for therapy, but I've been through a lot of trauma and I really wanted to dive in. She told me it was better to actually not talk about everything and just pick what's important - but it's hard for me to do that. Also I've gone to 10 years of talk therapy and no one has ever said \"less is more.\"\n\nAnyway, we booked the next session and I had to go to the washroom before leaving. I didn't see a person sitting in the waiting room. The office is shared with a massage therapist. When I came out I heard laughing from her office and realized my therapist and another woman I assume was the massage therapist were chatting. I got the sense that they were talking about me and tried to listen. I hear something like \"it's definitely all cognitive\" and \" there are patterns I'm noticing from her.\" \n\nI went home and wrote in a local Facebook group about my experience. It's hard enough for me to verbally express myself, and the idea of someone sharing what I talked about and laughing mortifies me. I felt humiliated and vulnerable and helpless. If I can't even trust a therapist, who can I trust? \n\nLater that day my therapist messaged me on Facebook saying that she heard about my post and that I should stop spreading libel. I do not have her on Facebook. The post wasn't even public. She wrote a long message about how I was wrong that she was talking about me and she was actually talking to a client. But that doesn't make sense because in that time I went to the bathroom how could they be having that kind of a conversation? Also if it were false why wouldn't she talk to me in a more professional manner?\n\nI feel like I'm going crazy. Am I imagining things? Did I hear the therapist wrong? Did I imagine the abuse in my relationship? From my family? I know I have good intuition from past experience, even if I have some cognitive issues. The scary part is, I was just telling the therapist this - how I have lesions in my brain from (probably) MS and don't know if I can trust myself, but I do have good intuition. If I'm wrong about this she probably thinks I'm nuts. Maybe I am.\n\nI feel like hiding from the world and never coming out.", "subreddit": "NarcissisticAbuse"}

We ignored each other the entire time - is it the best approach?", "author": "colonelguise", "self_text": "Context: I\u2019m in the gray area between low contact and no contact since our break-up months ago. Basically we have a hundred or so mutual friends, so the best I could do is unfollow/block him on social media and not respond to any of his messages - he has tried to hoover at least 4 times and I did not respond at all.\n\nWent to a holiday dinner with really good friends (more than 15 years of friendship), most of whom know that I went through narcissistic abuse for about a year when I was in a secret relationship with one of our other friends - the narcissistic ex - in the group. It is unfortunate that we are in the same social circle, but we had managed not to see each other in events/gatherings until yesterday - he showed up unexpectedly, but I\u2019d like to think I handled it the best way I could.\n\nThose who know of the abuse became discreetly protective of me; we ended up sitting on opposite sides of a long table thanks to my discreet support system. When he showed up, I didn\u2019t really acknowledge his arrival, and he made no attempts to say hello to our side of the table as well. As the night went on, he was having an intense conversation (probably about work, or about himself) with 2 other friends on his end (and I could tell they wanted to get out of there as well lol), while the rest of us were merrily drinking and sharing funny stories.  \n\nIn my head, I would catch myself thinking how annoying his presence was, but decided not to spoil the night and just enjoyed my time. At one point, I passed around gifts to everyone except him, precisely because I didn\u2019t know he was going to show up. In reality, I brought a back-up gift (in case some other unexpected friend shows up) but decided not to give it to him; he has taken too much from me and yes, I went to that level of petty I suppose, but it was a powerful moment for me. And besides, he didn\u2019t bring gifts for anyone anyway, being the self-centered guy that he is.\n\nEventually, it was time for goodbyes and we still successfully evaded each other until he finally left. To summarize, we ignored each other for the entire night, and I\u2019d like to think that was the ideal approach given the circumstances. But some of those common friends who didn\u2019t know about the abuse posted photos of the dinner and tagged both of us. I cringed and just hid them from my feed.\n\nThe morning after though, I find myself reading up on narcissistic abuse again, if only to validate if my approach to the situation was optimal. I was prepared to go gray rock on him had he initiated a conversation, but I guess I felt some relief that we opted to just ignore each other the whole night. But is it the best way to deal with these things? There will be countless social events in the future - other lunches and dinners, weddings, birthdays of common friends. Do we just ignore each other forever then? I\u2019m interested to know everyone\u2019s insights on this.", "subreddit": "NarcissisticAbuse"}

I have been experiencing a rollercoaster of emotions (mostly anger) towards him, and throughout this whole breakup, I have been going through hell. However, the holidays have been going smoothly, and I have rarely been thinking about him over these past few days which has brought me a lot of peace.\n\nTonight as I was getting ready for bed, I decided to play music from a playlist that I had made 2 years ago. I hit shuffle, and the first song that comes on is one that I haven't heard in a VERY long time. It was one that reminded me of him. I'm getting choked up writing this. It reminded me of the love-bombing stage. I remember being in college and hearing that song for the first time and immediately thinking of him. I felt so lucky to be with him, to finally be treated right, to feel true love. I showed the song to him and he liked it, but it was more of my own thing that I would listen to when I would want to think about him and all of the wonderful things we did together. \n\nBut of course, that was just the love-bombing.\n\nI stood in my bathroom tonight and listened to this song. I felt a part of my heart pour out and I allowed myself to cry about him for the first time in a few months. All of the really happy times came back to me and I allowed myself to feel every single one of them as this song played. It was surreal. I know it was love-bombing, and I know I shouldn't romanticize, but this was a completely different thing. \n\nI was so happy in those memories. Life was so good. I was so in love with someone who I thought had the same compassion and respect for me. I was able to travel to new places with him, be myself with him, be vulnerable and young and on top of the world. I allowed myself to feel this way because I know for a fact that MY feelings are real. MY experiences have value, and I placed the highest value on those experiences with him. I mourned that girl who was on top of the world, and I mourned who I thought he was.\n\nWhat I'm saying is, it is okay to mourn. Please do not think that being months out means you cannot mourn. No, you are allowed to. We are human. We are allowed to feel and have the right to. Holding in something like this can honestly set your grieving process back even further. Please cry.

For a bit of pretext, I was a chubby kid, pretty by some standards, and I always seemed to attract creeps. I was a very quiet child, and I tended to agree to almost anything to avoid conflict. So, I was pretty much an easy target, which made me withdraw from social situations even more.\n\nBy the time this happened, I was pretty much always just at home. I was in high school in a conservative Asian country, and living with my mother, my grand mother, and a maid. We\u2019d just moved to a new house about four months before, and were just getting used to living away from my extended family. Then, my mom brought home a boyfriend, who I\u2019ll call Gomez for the sake of writing. \n\nHaving been raised by a single mother my whole life, I was wary of this man, especially when my mother let him sleep over the first night that I met him. My mom and I weren\u2019t really that close, in fact, she scared me so much that I never really talked to her about anything, which is important to this story. She never really hit me or anything, but she was always very ill tempered and would react very harshly to any of my questions. She rarely listened to my stories about school, and would never tell me anything about her life, that\u2019s why I learned to just keep anything bothering me to myself. This is why I never voiced out my discomfort of having this stranger stay with us. I was afraid of how my mother would react to me telling her that I did not feel comfortable around this man. \n\nFor the first month after Gomez was introduced to me, the two of them mostly locked themselves up in my mom\u2019s room, only coming out when it was time to eat or when they needed to go out. I rarely saw my mom at all, and I mostly spend my time with my grandma and our maid. Gomez would act shy and timid, and we rarely spoke. On the second month or so, my grandma got sick, and my mom decided to send her to my aunt\u2019s house because they could take better care for her. It was fine with me then, since I still had our maid, and we were pretty close. Sadly, this was the turning point that started the nightmare that I had to suffer through for around 8 months.\n\nOur maid and I slept in the same room, with me on the bed and her on a futon right beside it. She would wake me up in the mornings for school, and take care of my dog when I\u2019m away. One night, around 2 weeks after my grandma went to stay with my aunt, I woke up to our maid packing her bags. I asked her, \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong, where are you going?\u201d It was around midnight, so it was weird that she was up, weirder still that she was packing all of her things. She looked at me, both sadness and anxiety evident in her eyes, and told me that she was taking some time off because of an emergency. She said her boyfriend was picking her up by the gate of our subdivision, and that I should go back to sleep, since I had school the following day. I hugged her, and said goodbye, thinking that it was probably a temporary leave. I was wrong. I found out the next morning that my mom had let her go, and that she was never coming back. I tried to ask her why, but she wouldn\u2019t give me a reason, just dismissed my questions by telling me to get ready for school.\n\nAround a week after our maid left, I had watched a particularly scary movie at my friend\u2019s house, which left me antsy. I always had a very active imagination, and I couldn\u2019t shake the feeling that something bad was there, just out of sight. I kept feeling like there was someone in my room with me, and I know I should have been too old to be scared of the dark, but I was. It was around midnight on a school night, and I couldn\u2019t sleep over how fast my heart was racing. I was tossing and turning in bed when I heard shouting and loud bang against the wall. Gomez and my mother were fighting, and I could hear her crying. I was shocked, frozen on my bed. No matter how creeped out I was by this guy, I had never heard them fight before, and now there they were, on the other side of my wall, sounding like Gomez was trying to kill her. The shouts rang out for another few minutes before I heard my mom\u2019s door open and slam shut, and her sobs as she frantically knocked on my door. I threw back my covers and ran to open the door for her, and she scrambled inside on hands and knees. It was dark in my room but I could see a dark bruise on her wrist and forearm. She slid behind my door, trying to hold it closed when Gomez threw it back, hard. It slammed against my mother\u2019s body, hard enough that she cried out, but she didn\u2019t let it open far enough to let Gomez inside. When it still wouldn\u2019t open, Gomez pushed again, over and over again, until my mom was crushed between the door and the wall. I was frozen, trembling as I watched everything unfold before me. I wish I could have done something to help her, I really do. But my brain felt like it turned off the moment I saw my mom crying. I never saw her cry, not once, but there she was being beat by the man that she claimed to love.\n\nGomez dragged my mom out from behind the door and dragged her back into their room. More shouts followed as I held my door open and stood there, crying. I heard glass breaking before their bedroom door slammed open and Gomez stomped down the stairs, an overnight bag on his back. My mom followed him out, clutching her wrist to her chest, and told me to go back my room. She followed me inside and tucked me into bed before curling up on the floor, just beside me. She cried, and I couldn\u2019t help but cry with her. I cried so long and hard that I didn\u2019t realize I had fallen asleep. I woke up maybe an hour later, and my mom was gone. I looked all around our house but there was no trace of her. I didn\u2019t have a phone or anything, and I didn\u2019t know any of our neighbors, so all I could do was sit on my bed and pray for my mom to be safe. Just as it was getting light outside my window, I heard out gate open, and there was my mom. With Gomez. They were hugging each other and talking in whispers, and I couldn\u2019t believe my eyes. Even now, seven years later, I couldn\u2019t understand how they went from that fight to loving in such a short amount of time. My mom told me to get ready for school when she saw me awake, but I couldn\u2019t take my eyes off the bandage around her wrist, or how swollen her face was. Gomez didn\u2019t even look guilty about it, he just went into their room, and told my mom to come inside as soon as I was gone.\n\nI wish the story ended there, but that was just the tip of the iceberg. The incident gave me nightmares, for days on end I would get no sleep at all, wondering when I hear them shouting again from the next room. It got so bad that just going inside my own room made me want to throw up. I was afraid, terrified, of how Gomez had treated my mom, and the thought of sleeping in the room beside theirs was enough to keep me up. I told my mother that I was scared of my room, and that I would sleep on the couch in the living room, since I was so sleep deprived that I couldn\u2019t pay attention in class anymore. I didn\u2019t tell her why I was so scared, just that I didn\u2019t want to sleep in that room anymore. I thought that being away from their room would keep me safe from the nightmares. Little did I know that decision would get me into a nightmare even worse, one that scarred me to this day.\n\nOnce I started sleeping the living room, my mom and Gomez decided to lay a futon out there and sleep with me. I know, this completely defeats the purpose of me getting away from him by moving to the living room, but my mom insisted. I knew I couldn\u2019t convince her otherwise, and I couldn\u2019t go back to sleeping in my room without telling her why, so I stubbornly slept on the couch. I would sleep with the blanket covering me from head to toe, no matter how suffocating it was. For a few days, it was fine, my mom was always sleeping between us, and Gomez was on the farthest side away from me. On the fourth day of this, my mom had to go on an out of town trip for work, but she didn\u2019t tell me. Gomez was also out of the house when I got home until before I went to bed, so I thought that maybe they were together. I was wrong. I woke up that night on the futon, where my mom usually slept, right next to Gomez. He was watching me, staring at my face as I slept. I don\u2019t even know how he moved me from the couch without waking me up, but I remember how my stomach dropped as soon as I opened my eyes. I tried to joke about how I didn\u2019t like the futon, and would rather sleep on the couch, but he said to me, \u201cNo, no, you stay right here.\u201d He held firmly onto my arm and pushed me onto the mattress. I knew I wasn\u2019t going to persuade him to let me go away, so I covered myself with a blanket, praying to God that I don\u2019t move that night as I tucked the blanket so tightly around my body that there was no way he could take it off without waking me up. That\u2019s when I felt his hands, rubbing my back and legs through the blanket. I felt goosebumps all over skin as I tried to wriggle away from him, but he held me closer. He told me, \u201cDon\u2019t I get a good night kiss?\u201d\n\nWhen I didn\u2019t answer, he snaked his hand inside the blanket by my head and pulled it down hard, so that I couldn\u2019t hold it over me. He asked again, \u201cWhere\u2019s my good night kiss?\u201d I was shaking, and all I wanted to do was run far, far away. But he was much bigger than me, and I knew that even if I struggled, he could just pin me down. So I kissed his cheek, trembling the whole time. He said, \u201cThat\u2019s not how you kiss your father.\u201d I felt disgusted with how he said father, like it gave him power over me, but I was a scared little girl, and I couldn\u2019t do anything when he kissed me, on the lips this time. I may never have had a father, but I knew that wasn\u2019t right. I tried to pull away, but he held my head firm. I counted the seconds as I tried to wriggle away, and I was crying by the time he let me go. Then he made me lie down beside him again, and I cried silently under my blanket as he took my hand and put it on his crotch. I felt dirty, and weak from fear, so I made an excuse to use the bathroom and bolted up the stairs into my room. I didn\u2019t sleep that night, expecting him to burst into my room. Thankfully, he didn\u2019t. But he didn\u2019t stop there either.\n\nThe next day, after I got home from school. I was sitting on the couch when he sat on the opposite chair and casually asked me what my favorite porn site was. I was thirteen, had no social life or phone, and he had brought up this topic like he was talking about the weather. I stammered out a reply about how I didn\u2019t have any, and he looked at me like I was a pitiful. He then said that at my age, it was okay for me to have sex already, but that I should reserve some special \u201cacts\u201d for when I got married. Then he went on about how I should be \u201cgrooming\u201d myself, and how I would be so much more attractive if I did that. I felt sick, having this man talk to me like this, but I couldn\u2019t get the image of my mom crying out of my head. I wondered if he would hurt me the same way if I was too rude or if I denied him. I was scared of him hurting me, but I was also scared that he might hurt my mom even more, because no matter how creepy or disgusting Gomez was, my mom claimed to love him. \n\nI was thiking about all this when he suddenly tackled me, pinning me onto the cushion in a loose head lock. He said we were \u201cwrestling\u201d. I struggled to get away, but every time I tried, he would pull me back by the waist band of my shorts until I had to choose between being half naked or letting him pin me. I didn\u2019t know which would have been worse, but I wasn\u2019t about to let this man undress me, so I pulled my shorts back up and struggled to find another way out from under him. I pushed and I shoved at him for minutes while he tried his best to pin me so I couldn\u2019t move, all the while laughing at how I wasn\u2019t good at \u201cplaying around\u201d. He stopped when I started crying, telling me he was sorry before he kissed me again then telling me to go take a shower before my mom got home. I got my clothes and towel from my room, crying as I rushed to the downstairs bathroom. Tears dripped down my face and mixed with the water as I took the longest shower I\u2019d ever taken. I scrubbed at my skin so roughly that I was raw and bleeding at some places, mainly where he had touched me. I was disgusted with myself for letting him do that to me again and again. What did my mom saw in Gomez that made her overlook how truly awful he was? I didn\u2019t, and still don\u2019t understand. This pervert had free reign over me since my mom trusted him so completely with me that she was willing to leave me with him for days on end. I felt angry at my mom for letting this man into our lives, but more than anything, I loathed myself for giving him so much power over me.\n\nWhen I\u2019d cried myself out, I turned off the shower and started toweling myself dry. That\u2019s when I heard it, the soft click of a camera shutter coming from the small window at the upper wall of the bathroom. I whipped my head around and saw it. Gomez, the pervert, was holding his phone into the window and was taking pictures of me while taking a shower. I don\u2019t know how long he had been doing it, but I felt completely drained. This perverted mother fucker had beaten me emotionally so thoroughly that I didn\u2019t even have the energy to scream. I dressed in a hurry and bolted up the stairs to my room, where I stayed the rest of the night. I cried the entire time, I didn\u2019t even come out to feed my dog or to greet my mother when she got home. I was mad at her too. I only came out my room to go to school, where I stayed until the latest possible hour. I didn\u2019t tell anyone what was happening at home, I was too scared and ashamed of what they would say if they found out that I wasn\u2019t fighting back. I tried to act as normally as I could.\n\nThis went on for months. I tried to avoid him as much as I could, locking myself in my room as soon as I could, never letting him be alone in the same room as me. My mom and I barely spoke anymore, they were always together. I thought I would be fine then. The next time he tried to kiss me, I said no and ran to my room, locking the door. That night, I heard him screaming at my mom and throwing things. The next day, he tried again, and it became a cycle of him taking it out on my mother whenever I rejected him. It got to the point where I let him have his kisses and pretend wrestling just so he wouldn\u2019t hurt my mom. Everytime I did, I felt so disgusted with myself that I started cutting myself out of self hatred. I was anxious all the time, and I barely studied anymore, I barely did anything. I got the lowest grades I ever had that school year. \n\nThat summer, after almost 6 months of constant abuse from Gomez, I used visiting my grandma as an excuse to go stay with aunt for a few days. At this point, I was no longer the chubby, reserved kid that I was before Gomez had come into my life. I was gaunt from lack of sleep and appetite, and I was wary of everyone. I never let anyone touch me first, and I would start crying when a man got too close. Gomez had ruined me so completely that I no longer recognized who I was before I met him. My aunt noticed it, and she kept pressing and pressing and pressing until I had no choice but to tell her. I kept my head down the whole time as I told her everything. I tried to laugh it off, saying at the end, \u201cat least he didn\u2019t rape me.\u201d She was silent for a really long time after I finished, and when I looked up at her, she looked so mad on my behalf that I finally started crying. She cried right with me, and told me that I shouldn\u2019t go back home until he was gone. She told me that I should tell my mother, but I told her no. I couldn\u2019t break my mom\u2019s heart like that.\n\nIt took her two months to persuade me to tell my mom. When I finally did, she was horrified, and comforted me, telling me she was sorry. I cried and slept next to her that as she talked with Gomez on the phone. The funny thing is, she woke me up that night. She was furious, not at Gomez, but at me. She told me that Gomez said that all the kisses were just a misunderstanding, and that he kissed all his other kids like that. He said that he had caught me watching porn on his laptop in the living room, and that I was exaggerating everything. He turned me into a liar, and my mother believed him. \n\nI was absolutely enraged, but I was also tired. If my mom believed his words more than me, then what was the point? I told my mom that I wasn\u2019t coming home with her. I transferred schools and lived with my aunt for the next six months. In those six months, I cut myself every night, and attempted suicide three times. My mom never said she was sorry, but she begged me to come home when she and Gomez broke up on the sixth month. I didn\u2019t forgive her, nor did I trust her, but I went home anyway from guilt at leaving her alone.\n\nOur relationship was rocky then, with neither of us willing to talk about what happened with Gomez again. Two months pass, and we move to a new house, and I thought that maybe the whole ordeal with Gomez was finally over. So imagine my surprise when my mom came home one day with Gomez. They were apparently back together. This time, I didn\u2019t stay silent. I screamed at my mom, told her that I wasn\u2019t living in the same house as him. I thought that our relationship was starting to repair,  but she was back to ignoring my words. I refused to be in the same room as him at all, and spent all my free time either inside my room or outside with friends. This time, Gomez\u2019s stint in my life was much shorter though. One minute he was there, then the next, he was not. \n\nAt the time, I thought maybe they just had a fight. It wasn\u2019t until my mom got very drunk a couple of days later that I found out why Gomez was no longer with her.\n\nApparently Gomez, that sick mother fucker had cheated on her with a 17 year old girl. He had gotten the girl pregnant, and my mom tossed him out. I didn\u2019t think much of this at first, not even shocked at his latest disgusting act.\n\nI got a Facebook friend request from him a couple of days ago. In his profile picture, was him beside a girl who looked like a very slightly older version of me. We could have been twins, if it wasn\u2019t for the kid she was holding. My blood turned cold, and I immediately blocked him. The girl he had gotten pregnant before looked like me, one that was only three years older at the time he was terrorizing my life. I felt sick, knowing that this man was still out there, with someone who looked so much like me. It felt like a part of my will never be free of him. \n\nGomez, you sick, perverted little shit, I hope we never, ever meet again. And to the girls out there with your own Gomezes, don\u2019t be like me. It took me a long time to learn to fight back, but I can\u2019t even tell you how much I wish I learned much earlier.", "subreddit": "survivorsofabuse"}

{"post_id": "egphzb", "created_utc": 1577530401, "title": "Were these signs of an abusive/unhealthy relationship? (LONG)", "author": "Lunareity", "self_text": "My friend encouraged me to go on one of these forums, so this is a first time thing for me. \n\nI was dating a girl from around February-October this year. We met around November/December of 2018 and things really hit off, we met on a discord server and eventually gathered some friends and made our own. Things were nice, I developed a crush on her and we eventually started dating. \n\nBefore we started dating, she did do some heavy drinking whenever we called at night, but I didn't pay much mind to it. I was 17, going on 18 in May, and she herself was 18. \n\nThe relationship was lovely in the beginning, that honeymoon phase you know? She was really sweet and we would call a lot and it would be a lot of fun, our friends were happy for us. Eventually, I learn that she was involved with a gang and that she was some kind of dark web hacker, at least that's what she told me. It was odd to me, but I wore rose-tinted glasses for her, so I didn't see it as any kind of red flag.\n\nAt some point, she told me she suffered from psychotic depression and was a diagnosed sociopath. I was talking to her on video call one night when she was having an episode, seeing hallucinations and whatnot. I tried my best to comfort her and reassure her through it all, but after that night, she never had an episode again. Also, later on she said she guessed she wasn't a sociopath because she cared about me.\n\nThen there was one time she overdosed on aspirin in front of me, which I was begging her to throw it back up because I was worried. She also had violent tendencies towards her ex-boyfriend, claiming she hit his head with a bat and knocked him unconscious. \n\nThen there was a time I heard her on the phone w/ her cousin, to which the conversation went: \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nCousin: Just use their emotions against them.\n\nGF: Yea, but I wouldn't do that.\n\nCousin: oh shut the fuck up\n\nGF: yea, but you'll never hear me admit to it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis...worried me a little, but again, I didn't see it as a red flag.\n\nIn May, she got mad at her ex for breaking her Juul, so she told me she got into a fight with him. I was worried, she got into fights a lot due to her anger issues, but she seemed fine. Then, she told me she was going to fight him and 5 of his friends at once, her only weapon being a pocket knife. Of course, I started crying and begging her not to do this, my cousin heard this and also asked her to think this through. \n\nMy girlfriend says that if she isn't back within 2 hours, she's probably either dead or in jail, then she leaves. I'm still on the phone, but she leaves her phone at home. At this point, I'm sobbing to the point of nearly throwing up while my cousin tries to comfort me.\n\nMy girlfriend is gone for 2+ hours and I'm convinced she was in jail or worse, so I kept crying. She comes back and ends the call without saying a word to me, then she messages me at 12 am when she **knows** I won't see. \n\nShe said the guys weren't there, so she went skateboarding with her friend instead. I was upset because she did that and didn't even think to...let me know, so she just let me think she was dead.\n\nI end up messaging her, telling her we need to work on communicating because this wasn't healthy, it wasn't right. I couldn't have a relationship where she would do dangerous and impulsive things when I'm begging her not to. She was online when I sent it, but she went offline without saying a word.\n\nShe ignores me for about a whole week, I sent 1 message every day, eventually telling her I wouldn't be mad at her, I just wanted to talk.\n\nIt was when she still didn't respond on my birthday that I had enough and sent her a breakup message.\n\nShe then texted my best friend and told her to tell me that she wasn't ghosting me or anything, she was in the hospital.\n\nYou would think after all of this, I wouldn't believe her, right? Well, I was stupidly in love, so I did. I forgave her instantly, even though she would come online for about an hour or more at a time every day. My experience w/ the hospital was that they wouldn't even let me have my phone or anything with me, but I just figured maybe her's was different.\n\nWe continued things on like we didn't even break up, but I was happy once more. \n\nThen when she was talking to me about some mental health-related stuff, I asked her if she ever thought she might have DiD (Disassociative Identity Disorder). She told me she didn't know what it was, so I explained it the best I could. After explaining, she tells me that she has experienced the symptoms of it and then just tells me she has alters and she's in a system. Despite never having shown symptoms before this talk and suddenly showing them afterward, I still believed her. \n\nOne day she told me she got a $600 assault charge because one of her 'alters' punched her friend in the face. I guess she used it as a scapegoat so I wouldn't get mad at her, and it worked.\n\nThen after some time, she tells me that she's going away and not to worry about her. I wish her the best of luck and tell her that if she ever needs me, I'm right there. Well, after a few weeks, she deleted her discord account. So I freak out, thinking something bad happened. I messaged her mom on Facebook and asked if my girlfriend was okay, my girlfriend messaged me on facebook later to tell me she was okay.\n\nShe comes back to discord and told me her break was for mental health reasons. Things are okay for the most part, I feel like we were getting distant, but I tried to keep things well between us. Then one night, she has an 'alter' talk to us. This 'alter' was a bit of a jerk to me, but I brushed it off. Then this alter tricked me into sending risque pictures of myself. Then the 'alter' reveals that the true reason my girlfriend went on that break was that she was doing cocaine and other hard drugs. Then the 'alter' proceeds to do cocaine on a call with me. \n\nDuring some time between things, I stopped being friends w/ one of our mutual friends, but I told her it was okay if she was still friends with them, I just wasn't. She cared a lot about this friend.\n\nNot long after, my girlfriend messages me, telling me that she loves me, but I know too much and she has to cut me off. She says she loves me, but it's best I forget her. She also says that she'll still be on social media, but she has to end everything.\n\nI was numb to it at first, I didn't know what to think. I think I was numb from the shock, it was so sudden and unexpected. I ended up venting to some friends about it, to which they told me she was in the wrong for being shady like that and just ending things with me. I started to feel, the first thing I started feeling was anger. I was angry and sad at the same time, I cried for a little bit. Eventually, I realize that she **knew** she was involved with dangerous stuff from the beginning, yet she *chose* to get close with people anyways. If she knew she was involved with dangerous stuff, why did she get attached to people anyways?\n\nThen, my boyfriend (My GF and I were in a polyamorous relationship with him), who is professionally diagnosed with DiD, tells me he believes she was faking having DiD the entire time.\n\nI started to realize how much she lied to me during our whole relationship- because I was so blindly in love, I didn't see the major red flags that were constantly being put up.  I truly don't know if everything she ever said to me was real. \n\nI was so deep in a honeymoon phase that her dropping out of college didn't bother me, her violent tendencies didn't bother me, and all the pain she caused me was okay. \n\nI've been so torn up about the relationship ever since it ended in October, I thought it didn't affect me that much, but I've started noticing my fear of abandonment and wondering if I'm being lied to.\n\nI don't want to think she was lying to me the whole time, we had a lot of good times in the relationship. I remember that I never thought I would get married, I always thought marriage was just a piece of paper- but with her, I wanted to marry her. I made it my goal to marry her because I love her so much. She also wanted to marry me, she would often tell me how much she loved me and how much I meant to her.\n\nI just wish I knew what went wrong- what made her want to leave me? Even now when I know the relationship wasn't good for me, I still believe I did something wrong. I constantly wonder if it was because I stopped being friends with that one person, if I was just ugly, or if I did something to upset her. \n\nI don't think I've ever experienced a toxic relationship before- but I have to ask.

The death of a family member,career transition,depression, and almost marrying my abuser. **I almost gave up everything, my entire life to be with the wrong woman, not just the wrong woman, a HORRIBLE woman**. During the entire relationship there was constant verbal abuse,triangulation,cheating,manipulation and on two occasions physical abuse, in a number of instances she tried to trap me and I never used protection for the entirety of the relationship.\n\nThe discard triggered something in my soul. It got me to look hard at myself in the mirror, ask why this happened and what I can do to never let it happen again. It got me to get my mind wired tight, do some working and praying and helped me to go on grow as a man. It's caused me to look at the areas in my life where I was lacking,what I needed,wanted, and how I allowed myself to stay in that situation for so long knowing that it would have killed me had it continued.\n\nAlmost a year later I can say that I'm the most whole,healthy,happy, and best version of myself that's ever existed since I became an adult. I've rebuilt broken relationships, and made new ones. I've transitioned successfully into my new career and I'm more successful than I was the entirety of the 4 year relationship. I've come to grips that I've had an emotional addiction along with other vices that I'm letting go of so that I can be the man my future self needs me to be. I'm working on becoming the best son,brother,uncle,friend, and professional I can be.\n\nI want to thank everyone on this sub for their posts and support through the various months but as I go into this new decade, I'm leaving what was done to me in this decade and I'm not going to carry it with me into the new one. That means not posting here, moving on and growing. I want to thank you all for everything, and I want to wish you all God speed, no matter where you are in your journey. If you've just been discarded or you're thinking of leaving, **I want to encourage you to do it, take the leap, dont take any more of their abuse**. **You are worth more than you know.** Once you stop drowning in these sad human beings, and you come up for air. The sky is your limit.\n\nTake care everyone and **make this decade YOUR decade**.", "subreddit": "NarcissisticAbuse"}

She was one of the most important people in my life, my closest friend, the person I ran to if I was ever in doubt or distress. When the relationship began to turn toxic I justified her actions by blaming her bad family life. Her mother is abusive and her sisters would enable her mother\u2019s behavior. I saw it first hand and was shocked at the things she was willing to say while I, a non-family member, was standing right there. One of the things Emma would do to me was constant questioning of...anything. More like an interrogation actually. Examples: i identify as Jewish, i said eggs should be cooked on Medium/low heat, berries should still be washed before eaten even if you bought them from a nice market. There was a point or multiple times she\u2019d hear me say that and interrogate me about it as if I was insane for an extended period of time until she would begin to prove otherwise: your only half jewish stop saying your jewish, eggs can be undercooked she eats them all the time heat doesn\u2019t matter, the berries are pre washed. She wouldn\u2019t let it go. And if I tried to divert or tell her to stop she would ask me why I was mad at her. It got so much worse as time went on and became more like torture. I know it was an aggression-thing but....idk. Even after two years I still sometimes feel like maybe I was just wrong about everything and she was right. Why do people do this? What do you think? Is it just an expression of aggression? Did someone do this to you?", "subreddit": "emotionalabuse"}

Lots of vices...\n\nWe've been together for about 5 months now. Our story is sweet. It all began very sweet and nice and beautiful, but the closer we got the more scared he got. And when he gets scared he gets very angry and mean. I am an architecture student and I'm leaving with Erasmus this next semester. This is what scares him. He wants stability since he's getting old...\n\nHe would get into all sorts of episodes... he'd keep insulting me based on my past (the men I've been with, the time I nearly got rped) He'd call me names and say it was my fault and all sorts of horrible stuff. But then he'd cry and apologize and really mean it, he hates himself when he gets like that.\n\nI was willing to accept that until... the one time it got physical.\n\nHe was on coke and alcohol. He drove us home, in one of his episodes, saying that same fkin speech as always. *I* *myself* had had a breakdown on the way over, screaming louder than I did in my life before going limp into a fetal position from which I was no longer able to move. We were at his house, it was 7am and people were leaving for work so he kept yelling at me to get out of the car and inside the house so that the neighbors wouldn't see. I couldn't move, I was just stuck.\n\nSo then he kept getting in and out of the car, kept pulling at my leg and arm (sometimes he'd accidentally grab my hair). When that didn't work he went into the house and got my suitcase (I was packed up to leave for Christmas) and he slammed the suitcase into me (my head mostly) and then pushed it against me and kept asking if I wanted at the train station or at the student dorms.\n\nEventually he asked me if I wanted him to carry me inside and I nodded. I knew I couldn't stay in the car forever but I knew I couldn't move. So he picked me up in his arms and carried me inside... I cry thinking about it. He put me on the couch, went to his stool where he usually sits and he started crying...\n\nI consoled him for the next 3-4 hours in which he couldn't stop crying because he realized what he's done to me and he was very scared of himself and wanted to check into a mental hospital. He promised we'd be happy at least until I leave with Erasmus at the end of February.. but ... it's just scary how the fights got worse and worse the closer February gets.\n\n\\-------------\n\nI am not willing to leave him. I invested too much into this relationship. I managed to get to him, past all of his barriers, it was me who chose to stay... We could finally be happy as he promised. I know it's an abusive relationship, I got so stressed that I got two periods in the same month, lost 4kg, got sick.

He's verbally and emotionally abusive and every video I've seen on youtube describing a narc and porn/sex addiction/issues fits him to a T. He doesn't think he'll hit rock bottom ever with his porn/sex addiction. He's already been blackmailed (a woman recorded him jerking off at a walmart parking lot) and shared personal information to random women online. I don't want to stick around with someone who says my Asian ethnic features are ugly and too masculine for him. While he deserves a perfect wife who goes to the gym 24/7, has huge boobs and dresses like a slut whenever he wants. Because forget the fact I've been molested and assaulted in my life that I'm more modest in my clothing.\n\nThought for awhile I was crazy and that he wasn't a narc just a messed up and immature individual. Nope.\n\nI'm needing help with getting things in order to leave. I brought in a lot of my own home goods and furniture into this 4 year marriage. He's never bought or brought anything into this relationship. He's also unfortunately bad with money and I'll have to save up to leave.\n\nMy plan is to sell, donate, and bring only my clothes, important paperwork, makeup (I'm a makeup artist. Invested a lot into my materials), and just my late Granny's antique pieces of furniture. Getting rid of as much as I can and squirreling away just enough money to get me home. \n\nI have family and friends 10 hours away. Unfortunately they have jobs and are also tight on money. I know they'd be willing to help come up and drive me back home. As soon as I got home I'd definitely get a job and pay them back for the kindness. \n\nIs this a decent plan of action or should I also consider other things?\n\nAlso, has anyone done a full legal separation with paperwork or did you just leave? I want to meet a lawyer for full details of a legal separation but for those experienced on dealing with a narc and leaving I'd like to know your side.\n\nThank you for reading and leaving any sort of advice or support.

I was chugging along until early November when my order for protection against him got rejected in civil court after an awful hearing and around the same time my band-aid relationship with another man fell apart.

Now our divorce papers says he is responsible but we had no specifics on what that was going to look like (I did the whole process without a lawyer).

He had been a very successful singer, traveling around the U.S. and to other countries to perform. When my boyfriend was 14, his mother had set up various \"fan programs\", pages and other things. One such thing was if fans paid \u00d7 price they would get an autographed photo and it worked it's way up to if you pay $\u00d7 then you would be able to face time with him (my bf.) Apparently, over time a man who was 71 followed and watched my bf's performances and paid enough to get the face time. My boyfriend initially did not want to be on the call but the man was just so cool that he wanted to keep talking to him.\n\nSoon after, the man invited my boyfriend to visit (and spend a few nights) at his house. My boyfriend lived in the upper midwest where as the man lives in Florida. Mind you, my boyfriend was still 14 at this time. My boyfriend's mother went to meet the man the first time, afterwards she let my boyfriend visit and stay with the man often. \n\nThe man has taken my boyfriend on my trips. He stayed with my boyfriend for at least a month in New York City. All while my boyfriend was a minor and his parents were not present. \n\nMy boyfriend calls this man his best friend, (bf has absolutely no other friends) calls him nearly every day, and a lot more. \n\nMore to the point...\nThe man encouraged my boyfriend to join the Navy ( this is not an issue at all) but... he more so encouraged my boyfriend to not have any relationships with girls or anyone new in general so that he would be more focused on his training. He encouraged almost completely solitude for 4 years. \nMy boyfriend finally joined a dating app when he turned 18 to explore a bit. He was about to delete the account after encouragement from the man but he saw my profile and was trying to start an argument over something I said thinking I was making up things but I sent him the evidence. He was intrigued and this developed into a relationship. \n\nMy boyfriend and I had a road trip planned and we would be staying the night together. We discussed things about becoming intimate, we both agreed we weren't ready for that. Then my boyfriend (a few days later) was freaked out making me promise we wouldn't have sex until after he finished all of his Navy training. 2.5 years. \n\nWhile I'm fine with this and respect anything my boyfriend wants, I had wondered why he was suddenly panicked even though we had discussed it before. I asked him what was up and what brought this on. His best friend had given him a huge talk that we shouldnt have sex and that I'd get pregnant and it would ruin his (my bf's) life. He would have to quit the Navy and work at McDonald's. This is not an exaggeration either. I don't care about having sex at all but I feel this is beginning to affect our relationship.

I pretty much know the answer, but I need the opinions and thoughts of others on what happened to me.\n\nMy wife and I are currently going through a divorce. I feel pretty certain that she is a narcissist due to her behavior and things she has said. What has me so uneasy is what went on between my wife and I during the first two weeks of November 2019.\n\nMy wife and I knew we were going to get a divorce; however we were sexually active for two weeks straight, and often multiple times a day especially on weekends. My wife called this a \"last-hurrah\" and said that she had often heard that it was common for people going through divorce.\n\nOur last time was the most disturbing for me, and still has my mind reeling. My wife has often wanted me to talk during sex, but honestly it makes me extremely uncomfortable. During sex I would rather just feel what is happening rather than to describe what I'm doing or talk about what I want to do. I know that it can sometimes be healthy to talk, but that doesn't make it any less comfortable for me.\n\nMy wife wanted me to describe what my darkest fantasy was to her. What I wanted to do to her while I was having sex with her. She wanted to know what I would do to her. I, ashamedly admit, that I have had rape fantasies in the past, and sometimes still do. I have never acted on these fantasies, and realize that that is all they are. I realize the consequences of acting out such a thing and I have no desire at all to do the real thing.\n\nUltimately what happened was that my wife coerced it out of me. As we are having sex, I begin to describe a brutal rape. We really getting into it, and she seemed like she was really into it as well, which honestly made it even more intense. Then when we finish, literally no more than what could have only been two seconds my wife's demeanor changes and does a complete 180. Her face changes from what I perceived to be pleasure to that of what felt like accusatory, and she looks at me with wide eyes and a smirk and says \"So basically rape.\"\n\nI felt so uncomfortable in that moment. I felt violated, like something I really had no desire to share had literally been ripped out of me and was now being used against me. She didn't go into a tirade, but instead discussed it with me. I don't remember anything she said, but all I can remember was feeling like there was something wrong with me. Like I was a terrible person for having these types of thoughts/fantasies. I honestly still do feel like a terrible person.\n\nIt wasn't long after this that things started going downhill in our divorce. Though I don't feel like this situation in particular was the route cause for everything going to hell, I do feel like it contributed and my wife plans on using it against me in court in her plans to keep our children away from me. I feel scared that she's going to say \"He's a terrible person and an unfit parent, because he fantasizes about raping people.\"\n\nWhat are your thoughts on this experience? Was I abused? Am I a bad person for having these types of fantasies? I really need some clarity on this situation?\n\ntl;dr: My STBX coerced a rape fantasy out of me that I didn't wish to share, and I felt terrible afterwards.

The worst experience that affects me the most, which wasn\u2019t part of any romantic relationships was when I was molested by a then-friend on a school field trip when I was 15. Recently I started a relationship with a girl I met who was studying abroad here in America. She is from Japan and she is one of the most legitimately kind women I\u2019ve dated. She\u2019s always kind in her texts and we\u2019ve grown close to each other and talk about seeing each other again, whether it be in my home city of New York or hers of Tokyo. \n\nAnyways, ever since she\u2019s gone back home I\u2019ve had an issue of trusting her. It\u2019s not her fault, but sometimes she\u2019ll take a long time to reply (a few days max), but each time I get worried it\u2019s the last time it\u2019ll happen and panic. Even as I say she\u2019s a good person my mind still panics and doubts about her. This happened today when I texted her at noon (2am her time, I acted rashly but I didn\u2019t say anything accusatory), she didn\u2019t open it but on Instagram I saw she was out with her friends. I don\u2019t like being controlling and clingy, but it turns out she\u2019s on a \u201cgirls trip\u201d (it translated at women\u2019s trip but I knew what it meant) with some of her friends. See, this is where I have two opinions at once. Rationally, the reason why she\u2019s not checking my stories immediately or responding to my texts is because she\u2019s on a trip with her friends and wants to focus on them and we\u2019ll talk again. But I still get scared she\u2019s done with me, or I\u2019ve lost her interest, or whatnot. \n\nI should note I\u2019m diagnosed with anxiety and depression and that\u2019s definitely playing a role. I never accuse her or insult her, by the way, so don\u2019t worry if I\u2019m taking my insecurities out on her. I just want to trust her and believe things will be okay and believe she\u2019s not a bad person.

Her life is a revolving door of strangers and short-lived relationships. \"Why do I always end up with the crazy ones?\" she said often, wondering how someone could possibly snap after months of her provoking and belittling them. If anything brings me solace, it's knowing she'll never be happy. No matter what anyone does for her, or how much someone loves her, she will find something about them to be jealous of and her hate will destroy whatever they build together. I don't like being comforted by the thought of someone's misery, but her treatment of us was horrendously cruel. Her excuse was always \"that's just how I am, take it or leave it.\" I know now that's textbook narcissism.\n\nThe situation that prompted this post was an anxiety attack I had last night. A mutual friend asked me to join her in a game I haven't touched since we were on speaking terms with the narc, and when I returned I got all these messages about the narc demoting me and moving stuff around, and it was just another reminder of just how petty and shitty she was.\n\nIt's been almost a year now since we stopped talking to her, but we're still in touch with quite a few of her friends.

I honestly care to never hear another thing about her ever again.\n\nI just wish I didn't have such deep, intense reactions to things that remind me of her. I hope someday to look back and go, 'why did I ever let that miserable person affect me so much'? She wasn't worth the stress then, and isn't now.

It quickly became clear we also had feelings for each other so we decided to see each other romantically.\n\nWe're now 4 months further and he moved in with me (long story short, he just got away from home and lived in a very temporary situation. I live in a house by myself so I felt like I couldn't leave him 'stranding').\n\nI love him, he's a really sweet, nice, intelligent guy. But I feel like I can only focus on the negatives. In the beginning I didn't do this but now that we live together and he expressed his love for me etc. I feel like I put up walls. Some of the 'negatives' I'm referring to are: he's really sweet but when he's mad he'll be very direct and says things in an almost aggressive manner, he forgets everything that I tell him.. I have told him already that my Nex acted like that all the time and that it makes me feel insecure, as if what I say isn't important, he wants to be with me 24/7 if that was possible and becomes sulky when I insist on my alone time, he says that we will last forever even though this is his first proper relationship ever,...\n\nHe also overwhelmed me during Christmas with a lot of (expensive) presents while he doesn't really have any money (he will be starting classes to become a pilot which cost almost everything he has saved up until now). This also made me freeze up completely.\n\nIs it weird that I feel like I'm in the lovebombing stage? Or am I just overreacting because of all the mental and physical pain my Nex put me through? \n\nI really don't know what to think anymore.", "subreddit": "NarcissisticAbuse"}

Maybe around 2 1/2 years. She dumped me last week, right before Christmas, and I wanted her back so bad until recently...\n\nIt really kinda began as soon as we started dating. I went to work, came home, she asked to come over... before I even answered, she was there, but thing is, I had plans to play video games with friends those evenings. She would tell me to get off of my game and spend time with her.. We had just started dating, so of course, I did as I was told. She lived 30 minutes drive away, no one would expect that anyways, it was impossible to fully take in.\n\nEventually I moved out of that place, moved in with her... Literally quit my job because I was so into her that I would rather live with her than anything. She wanted me to buy her things, I had no job yet, but I was immediately called cheap! I was called cheap for feeding myself, and not her. I opted in helping her get a job before me, and she did finally.\n\nThis is where it really transformed into a big issue. She would randomly buy me things while on Amazon at work, then come home and call me jobless, and emotionally, I already felt like garbage, because I didn't have a job... I didn't know the area too well, and I didn't even know what was around. I was looking my hardest. I finally got a job, and was finally able to pay rent without feeling like I was about to go broke.\n\nThat's when the items started spilling in... she bought random small, and large gifts... really any size gifts on random days, I kept telling her it was fine and she didn't have to get me anything, but she kept insisting. Part of me felt uneasy accepting this stuff, but I kept it anyways. Then it became food. She was feeding me things telling me that I didn't like her if I didn't eat it. I didn't know what to do, I was avid at going to the gym, but my girlfriend wanted me to eat or I would upset her... I ate.\n\nOne day, a certain game partook my interest. ***Fortnite***. I got a kick out of it, and was having a lot of fun, and she wanted to join in, I said sure. She didn't like it, she didn't like it so much, that she came here, to reddit, and showed me countless posts about how people are breaking up with their partners over the game. But heres the thing, I'm an introvert, which she knew, and I also have a lower drive, which made her feel like I was ignoring her. I told her I wasn't, I was just playing my game.... I mean it was only when she was sleep so it was ok, right? Nope, not in the slightest. My schedule adjusted based on if she was home or sleeping, I never played when she was awake, unless she was preoccupied doing something else. Sims, Overwatch, PS4... (I had an Xbox, and so did she).\n\nMy day was simple : Work &gt; Home &gt; Fortnite ( Shes at work) &gt; Hang out with her when she got homeIt eventually became : Work &gt; Home &gt; Hang out with her because shes home first, but I can't play anything because she was upset if I did... but, she eventually started saying it was okay that I went to another room to play the game after hanging out for ***6 hours,*** either sleeping or watching her play the sims. That was boring, but I did it to spend the time with her that she wanted.\n\nI stopped playing Fortnite when she was home for a while, started getting on my PC and looking for more jobs, but she got massively clingy, and suddenly wanted to be in the room with me all of the time. Asked to play the Xbox, even when she had her own. I told her that I was currently doing something, I was working on something, and she threw a fit. That's the first time I had seen her do that. She didn't get her way, so she went into her room, and started talking to another guy on the phone. Nothing happening... at least yet...\n\nA month passes, at this point its a routine again, but this time, she had quit her job... just walked out because she didn't like it. I started playing Fortnite again, but only after hanging out with her... she started kicking me out of the room and talking on the phone. \"She was home all day, why would she need to talk to him now that I'm home?\" I asked myself. She was trying to make me jealous. She yelled at me for the first time at that moment too. It made me so uneasy when I first asked her why she talked to her friend when I just got home. She wanted me to do things with her, but she only wanted to do what she wanted, never sided with me or never something we can both agree on. Something **she** wanted to do.\n\n*\"Why can't you leave me alone and let me talk to my friend... go back to your game!\"*\n\nI hadn't even been home for 5 minutes, and now this? I guess I'm forced to go do... whatever... at this point I'm not even enjoying Fortnite because all she does is complain that all I do is play it... but the thing is, I  wasn't playing it at all, I was being forced into what I started calling my own room, and watching shows or napping, and she would be on the phone the **whole entire time.**\n\nThat's when I found the messages. She used my computer when I wasn't home one day. Had a slip up and left herself logged into Facebook on Chrome. Ya know how Chrome opens up when you first turn your PC on if you didn't close the tab? Yea, that happened. She was flirting with another guy and when I confronted her, she said it was no big deal.\n\n*\"We were just... role-playing a little.\"*\n\nI broke up with her that night. She apologized and bought me breakfast, just like every time I'm upset and she did something that I didn't like... I kept telling her she didn't have to do that. She insisted on doing other things that morning and I turned it down. She wanted me to do things with her so bad, I told her I needed time, and left for work. By then she began talking to another guy for attention. She needed attention so badly, that 2 hours after I had left for work, she was calling me telling me this person was hitting on her, and when I read the messages, I told her to block him because he was persistent. She said it's not that big of a deal. That he's her friend. That she didn't have many friends.\n\n**I'm going to shorten this up.**\n\nI finally started to see what was going on after I moved out... but by then I had gotten back with her.\n\nThroughout the relationship :\n\n* She cheated twice and called it the past when I told her it made me insecure about things, she said it's in the past and she didn't know why I felt that way, and that it wouldn't happen again\n* She talked total crap about me online, name dropped me and everything\n* When I asked her to do something she would say \"I have ADHD you know I can't do that, do it yourself\"\n* She sought out other people when I wasn't home.. working (Never did anything else)\n* Her friends didn't like me and she was so happy because it made her feel good to talk about me to them when we had the thinnest walls in the world\n* She ruined my friendships. A friend of mine had an emotional breakdown because she called them words that I will not repeat here. All because she thought me and this person who lived 30 minutes away were hooking up somehow.   ( I don't drive)\n* She called me sad and narcissistic, abusive, controlling, manipulative\n* She told me I deserved the abuse that happened to me from the year 2002-2009\n* She told me my parents don't love me, so why should she\n* She would physically hurt me. Hit me with things, attack me for not doing what she wanted.\n* She would wake me up to yell at me about something she was upset about knowing I had to be up in a few hours (She wouldn't let me sleep)\n* She threatened run away if I didn't sleep in her room\n* She always gave me the silent treatment if she didn't want to talk about something she did to me\n* She even created a whole \"space\" like I wasn't allowed to get in the bed unless she said so\n\nI tried to forgive her for it. I really did, I asked her to talk to me about it, she said she didn't want to, and that she is repressing what she did to me and that I didn't deserve to talk to her about it because she was happy. That I bring her down, and that she had been too happy lately. She then broke up with me, and told me she had been cheating the whole time I was gone. I was gone for only a month. She broke up with me only days before Christmas, and it just made it worse that way.\n\n***I left to visit here to get myself together mentally, and physically.

I'm an 18 year old woman. A few weeks after starting my businesses, my parents started having an issue with my boyfriend (whom they already gave permission to ask me to marry him...), None of their reasons made any sense. For instance, they wanted me to leave him because he won't drop out of collage to marry me right now (!!!) (He is 20). Another is that he didn't call me every single moment of every day. Apperently those things mean that he doesn't love me. They said that it was my choice to either stay or leave but then they kept going on and on and making things up about him. It was pissing me off because I truly love him and none of what they were saying was true but I decided not to fight. They found out that I told my boyfriend that I would wait for him.... Because if you love someone, you would wait... RIGHT??? They wanted us to get married after only being together for 6 months at the time and wanted him to drop out of school... I am no way going to ask him to give up his dreams, just the same as he would never ask me to give up mine. Because I said that I would wait for him, they told me that I had a few weeks to find somewhere to live. An hour later, my parents came downstairs and told me that I needed to be out the next morning. They continued talking and yelling at me till 2:30 in the morning... I had 5 hours to pack all of my things at that point. They said that I was a disgrace, not a Christian, a waste of 18 years of their lives, a mistake, a whore and many other things. They told me that if any of my friends parents ask what happened, they will tell them that they had to kick me out because I'm a \"perpetual liar and wanted to have sex with my boyfriend\" which is not at all true.  Now there are rumors going around amongst my old friends (I only have one real friend other than my boyfriend) and previous coworkers (my dad works with them). So I got kicked out. My siblings keep asking me why I don't love them and won't move back in, even though I've tried to explain what happened without making them hate my parents (I'm a step child to my father , the kids are all his and they treat them fine. I've always been abused by him but they arent. Also I was like a mother to all of them, due to me being 7-16 years older than each of them) they don't seem to understand and it breaks my heart. I started living with my boyfriend's family and I am still unable to find a new job, I think due to the holidays. My boyfriend and I got engaged on Christmas, I am so happy about that but I'm suffering from depression, especially at night. I don't know what to do. I know that I've been through a LOT, including failing my exam last month... I lost my job, my home, failed my exam and my relationship with  siblings all in 2 months. I feel like I'm going crazy.

I still don't really know whether everything constituted as emotional abuse in a friendship or not. If it was it was definitely subtle. After having blocked and deleted my friend everywhere (social media, phone), talking a lot with my therapist, and stopped making excuses for her I realized that my experience of the friendship checked a lot of checkboxes for emotional abuse. \n\nHaving gotten out of it made me more mentally stable, my self confidence is back... Then again the timing also coincided with a failed suicide attempt (the two are related), so I would expect some improvement mental health-wise. \n\n* We were close friends and hung out a lot. I went abroad for work for half a year. When I came back, she started to avoid me at work. Whenever I went down to her office to ask for a coffee I was always sent away: \"I have no time right now\". Sometimes when I went back to my office not soon after I have heard her taking a coffee break from the break room. Going back to her office again and again (with officemates knowing what is up) was extremely humiliating. However she also kept telling me to try again later when I wanted to talk about it. We always took coffees together so there was nothing weird of me asking. I still don't know what has happened.\n* At the same time privately she was more than eager to hang out with me. Getting drunk together after work in one of the meeting room and watching movies happened multiple times. We got too close (as in almost made out but then the security guy threw us out at 3AM...) and I slowly fell in love. She was in a relationship. as I was cheated on like this, I asked her to put a stop to hangouts like this. Additionally I was very hurt by the constant humiliating position she put me at work. That is where the arguments started. \n* This was followed by arguments, silent treatment etc: Multiple times we tried reconciling which was just followed by her randomly stonewalling me for days, weeks on and off until I started an argument about it. Then no talking for weeks/months.\n* In the meantime she did break up with her boyfriend and got together with her office-mate that she started to hang out with just before the first arguments. There was a quite a considerable overlap between her relationship ending and the new one starting. \n* This on and off kept happening with random bouts of silent treatment. Including her not inviting me to a common friends surprise stag (that she organized for some reason)... later she denied, and just said \"You are way out of line! I just forgot about you. \" even though she had the nerve to ask me for recommendations for an undisclosed party...\n* Fast forward this summer her (different) relationship was failing and was long distance. I didn't know about her being in a relationship. She reached out to me wanting to hang out again, and being all apologetic. I was stupid enough to accept. Hang out almost every day for hours. I am invited to her place to \"get drunk and bake a cake\". Just before that I find out that she is still in a relationship....  Didn't get into an argument, but eh.....\n* Soon after we had to move to a different continent just with her and a different workmate. It has been extremely stressful. My mental health hasn't been good as is (chronic depression, occasional major depression). I reached out to her thinking she was a friend. \"Can we grab a coffee? I need a friend, I have a hard time coping\"... she could maybe make time in 2 days. After that the random stonewalling and silent treatment restarted. She became condescending towards me as well. Apparently she thought of that as a personal attack. Later on we got into an argument (my fault, said something stupid while we were drunk - brought up her cheating on her ex). The argument turned really nasty... or to be more exact I kept apologizing and crying uncontrollably, she kept piling on and hitting all my insecurities. The friendship was gone again.\n* Two days of crying later, I attempted suicide (and failed). While it was not necessarily her fault (always had serious mental health issues); I cannot say that she played no role in it. \n* I tried to reconcile, she kept stonewalling me \"we just had an argument and need some space. You are overreacting\". One month passed. Still stonewalling. I tried to talk to her in person. She rejected that. Argument. Blocked, deleted everywhere.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy observations in hindsight:\n\n* In the past I was like her. Or so I thought. I was never abusive. However due to an abrasive personality I lost all my friends. So did she, and therefore I had a lot of compassion for her situation. This combined with feelings for her made me overly forgiving. \n*  I worked extremely hard to become a better person, and I succeeded. However the past years she made me feel like I never succeeded in becoming a better person. I was always afraid that I was the abusive one. I was the one starting the arguments after all....\n*  In hindsight, now I know how much I was afraid of getting stonewalled again, often for no reason. It changed how I behave around her, and also days before and after hanging out with her. \n* I was always the one apologizing. Trying to communicate openly. She never ever did either. \n* No communication from her side whatsoever. I still don't know why anything happened...\n* Whenever we hung out, it was on her terms. I rarely got to organize any hangouts. \n* My self-esteem and therefore my dating life took a huge hit. While I having relationships on and off during this, I always felt kinda worthless when it came to being able to get a date. In hindsight, it was extremely weird since I rarely even have to initiate (yes, I am bragging a bit :))...\n* Suppose it was not intentional on her part... (both dealing with depression and extreme stress at work) I have had to realize that if she is not willing to even discuss it or take my complaints seriously, then it really doesn't matter what her intentions were. From my point of view, I was in an abusive relationship for 3 years during the most difficult period of my life, and she had the power to stop it...\n* Nothing is black and white. I do see her point of view in a lot of cases. It doesn't mean that I should not have empathy. But it also doesn't mean I need to forgive for now. I believe people can change. But I would need to see hard evidence for it, and it wouldn't happen anytime soon.\n* It is very difficult to blame someone for a suicide. I did tell her in the last argument what happened. Mainly because her giving a friend shit for reaching out while clearly in crisis is extremely dangerous. Regardless of her intentions and whether a suicide is her fault is not. There is nothing subjective about this. (I told her this)  \nI have to be honest, I would be very happy to tell her that it is also partially her fault. Because it is. She should deserve to suffer on having that on her conscious instead of me having it on mine.... That being said, no one deserves to suffer the long term consequences of this.

I liked getting attention from the girls too so in my eyes I was straight.\n\nIm gonna avoid most of the details but years later I pretty much fell into a pothole of addiction to him. After sharing music tastes with friends i noticed a pattern in the music he would have in his spotify playlists and also noticed bread crumb trails of gaslighting/guilt tripping/intimidation etc on his other social media stuff. He had tried pretty hard to seduce me indirectly in person on many occasions and blamed me for being afraid of him but even after confusing my hurt for love/attraction and sending him paragraphs of apologies and confessions of love to him im pretty sure I was never attracted to him in the first place since after my repression episode subsided i remember being strongly attracted to a couple of my school teachers during these times, but never to a male in my age group.\n\nI pretty much mimicked his behaviour and noticed that other people had tagged along too and pretty much everyone i knew or met in the future was involved in some subliminal game of musical chairs where u gotta be charming, seductive, u gotta be fun, u gotta win.

With the strength of the subconscious mind we may listen to music that is relatable to our current situations without intending to, therefore people can feed off of that energy, and when it happens i feel like I have to respond (by intentionally adding more music) to try and un-do the thoughts that i have manifested in the minds of my distant friends, admirers and exes/ stalkers so that they do not get the wrong impression. It causes me to listen to music/add music to the playlists, that is so relatable to me that its as if i wrote the lyrics myself for each given scenario and responder. It has its possitive sides though as ive learnt what type of communication and expression skills i can use to keep myself at a safe mental distance from people. I would add whatever song was needed for my responses to be funny or compassionate all while trying to remove any sense of attraction or resent towards me from these people. and even at times to express my genuine thoughts and feelings toward someone who may have been watching\n\nIt also helped me understand what type of person my NFriend's girlfriend was when she started communicating with me this way, it really patched things up after we were pretty much left divided and conquered by him before we became fully aware of this \"game\"\n\nMaybe its not all that bad surrounding myself with information (music) that alligns with my moral beleifs and character?

Hansen", "author": "Neongypzy", "self_text": "Reddit took down my original post due to not having enough context. \n\nAnyways, wanted to repost because this is a powerful message. In my certain situation, as I'm sure a lot of you can relate, my nex started out inspiring me. That's what made me fall in love with him in the first place. He pushed me to be the best I could be. Once I moved in, that all changed very quickly. He went from inspiring me to draining me REAL QUICK. Now I sit here a year and 3 months later pregnant with his child, completely alone with no support, and getting ready to move out. Dealing with all the emotions &amp; sickness that come with pregnancy has been really hard, especially when you're doing it by yourself without a supportive partner, but LADIES- IT CAN BE DONE.  At the end of the day you must take care of you regardless of the situation. It's hard, I know, some days it feels like I cant make it through. But then I remember who I was before this RELATIONSHIT. I am a strong, intelligent, beautiful, caring woman who has gone through addiction &amp; got clean, lost my grandmother &amp; father within 2 months of eachother 2 years ago, and have dealt with an abusive partner while caring for his 3 children while barely holding onto my sanity. If I could get through that, then I can get through this. Its heartbreaking, lonely, and sometimes down right madening- but in the end I will persevere. \n\nTo all my ladies &amp; gents who are dealing with a monster of a person, YOU WILL PERSEVERE. Choose YOU at the end of everyday and dont let someone else define who you are. If someone tries to shake you, throw you off your path, and destroy the essence that makes you you, they are drainers due to their own lack of self love. Ditch them and find the ones who inspire you to be the best you can be.\nRemember, you are always in control of how you let others effect you. Take back the control they have taken away and dont waste your precious breath or time on something that will always take, but not give.

I couldn't believe it.\n\n\\- One day, at breakfast, he answered the phone (his landline) and when he hung up, I didn't say a thing. I didn't want to pry. He said it was his parents, and if I didn't believe him, he would show me all the incoming calls he had received for the last few days. I said I didn't mind, that I believed and trusted him and he didn't have to prove anything, but he insisted. I saw an incoming call from one of his ex-girlfriends.

Which caused my friend to threaten him bodily harm if he didn't let us leave. \nWe were finally able to run out of the house in our pj's and go to my ex's parents place for refuge.

I\u2019ve been made a social pariah by ex and his family for coming out, and I\u2019ve lost essentially more than 1/2 my family and several very close friends because they listened to his stories about me being crazy and making everything up.

My friends who are here tell me to forget everyone and just let them go.

We\u2019re not being protected by law nor by family, and we keep getting thrown to the wolves and abused despite the fact that I am separated from ex.\n\nI\u2019ve been considering making a PSA social media post on my account regarding the sexual abuse and domestic abuse he put the kids and I through. I don\u2019t want it to be detailed regarding the abuse, however I want to go into detail about what I\u2019ve run in to since coming out and the most unhelpful things people have said and done to the children and I. My goal, as a NY resolution and all around life change is to never again inadvertently facilitate sexual or domestic abuse, and to help others avoid doing the same. I\u2019m hoping when people I know read it they don\u2019t think of me being a whistle blower on my ex, but rather learn things not to say and do when someone finally comes forward with abuse allegations.

I only came forward and finally called the police the night my children and emergency personnel finally convinced me he was going to kill me. Even when it was that obvious, I couldn\u2019t wrap my head around the fact he was going to do it because I thought \u201che would never truly hurt me though.\u201d People telling me and reinforcing what he\u2019d been telling me for years and what I\u2019d been trying to convince myself of was so detrimental to me, and to him as well because it reinforced his delusions that he wasn\u2019t abusive.

The irony that should not be lost is that everything in the narcissist's life is about binary polar opposite extremes.\n\nEmpaths by default are a narcissist\u2019s consummate \u201cfuel\u201d source; they are in essence the highest grade race car quality fuel money can buy \u2014 which provides a resource rich in integrity, goodness, honesty etc. The narcissist has a \"fuel deficiency\" in those areas.\n\nEmpaths have the ability to not only personally experience a myriad of emotions but also they can vicariously access other people\u2019s emotions through the conduit of empathy.\n\nAn empaths ability to put him or herself in the \u201cemotional shoes\u201d of someone else exponentially enhances empath\u2019s ability to connect with others which is something narcissists can not do well, if at all.\n\nAs a result of their ability to experience an abundance of emotions, empaths are in essence chock full of the kind of fuel enriching \u201cvitamins and minerals\u201d that narcissists find particularly satisfying.\n\nDue to the fact empaths are sentient beings who are gushing with premium fuel, the empath is highly regarded prize catch. Narcissists who by virtue of their low esteem are \u201cfuel deficient.\"\n\nThe Mask\n\nNarcissists wear a mask of a false self which radiates his empathetic SO\u2019s attributes. The narcissist is aware that birds of a feather stick together. His mask is used as part of ploy to lure in unsuspecting victims.\n\nConsequently, the narcissist will present as...\n\n\u2022kind\n\n\u2022considerate\n\n\u2022compassionate\n\n\u2022generous\n\n\u2022honest\n\n\u2022goodnatured\n\n\u2022open minded\n\n\u2022giving\n\n\u2022loving\n\n\u2022accepting\n\n\u2022high integrity\n\n\u2022generous\n\n\u2022humble\n\n\u2022intelligent\n\n\u2022humorous\n\nIf the narcissist did not wear a mask, empaths would be able to peer into the narcissist\u2019s soul which is the last thing he wants.\n\nNarcissists are convinced that it is an absolute certainty that if an empath were able to see to his unmasked true self, the empath would reflexively run for the hills.\n\nThe narcissist twists and contorts as he cowers behind his mask. The only way he can protect his false self mask from being annihilated is to abuse those whom he needs most \u2014 empaths.\n\nUnderestimating NTs, narcissists will try in vain to whittle down the NT\u2019s spirit by misperceiving NTs to be:\n\n\u2022gullible\n\n\u2022naive\n\n\u2022foolish\n\n\u2022easily duped\n\n\u2022overly trusting\n\n\u2022idealistic\n\n\u2022unduly optimistic\n\nThe empathic NT SO was the narcissist\u2019s \u201cperfect fuel source\" in part because she...\n\n\u2022believed the narcissist was not the fraud the narcissist\u2019s caretaker(s) had tried to convince him that he is.\n\n\u2022believed the narcissist had the strength of character to treat the NT in the same manner the narcissist expected to be treated.\n\n\u2022believed the narcissist was not predisposed to obtaining a psychic lift from emotionally wounding the NT he allegedly admired.\n\n\u2022believed the narcissist had the ability to genuinely trust the NT who had deeply cared for the narcissist.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe saddest truth is that the people who least deserve to be on the receiving end of the narcissist's lash are the people who ultimately gave the narcissist what he wanted in the first place -- unconditional love without judgement.\n\nOne would would think the narcissist would cherish a good thing.

She wasn't being disrespectful, but I could see the old behaviors immediately return. We ended up spending the night together.

I eventually sent her a text explaining why I never saved our old pics and told her that our relationship was never real and some other hard-hitting realities about how I felt about her and our relationship.

Came out the other side of two different LTRs with narcs, making a grand total of 2 years and 10 months between the two of them and thought I was free, but no! Those kinds of assholes live and breathe at jobs I've worked along the way too. And how all of them behaved was pretty similar: self-absorbed, disgustingly self-important, delusions of grandeur, unable to properly value people including loved ones, malignant when challenged, always play the victim when you call them out, impervious to honest critique (even if it's well-intended). How openly hateful they have been has made them easier to spot after I've left them behind.\n\nBut a new monster came into the picture. One that really did seem like an empathetic, genuine person with genuine thoughts, hobbies, and an uncanny ability to connect with me. At first, we clicked and everything for our FWB arrangement was exciting and surprisingly smooth, but the rule about FWBs came into view: DON'T. CATCH. FEELINGS. And I saw him leaning toward that. Good morning texts, wishing he could take me to the big game, wishing he could stay the night and wake up next to me.... That was too cozy, to say the least, so I tried talking to him like a reasonable adult, like he said we could do if something came up. He asserted that if he caught feelings for me, that he would absolutely tell me and totally disregarded my perspective. Invalidated it, even after I pointed out the proof, then said he understood my perspective but his point still stood. That he'd tell me if he caught feelings. How he repeatedly invalidated me brought back trauma from my past abusers, and he was starting to look like one of them.\n\nHe chalked up his behavior to being empathetic, as to why he seemed to care so much about me. I pointed out that I'm a strongly rational person, and seeing an opportunity, he complimented me on it and said that I'd be able to call him out if he was developing feelings for me when he might not realize it. Please note that this paragraph and the last paragraph are within the same span of 10 minutes, maximum. I snapped at the bastard. I knew what he was doing, staying true to narcissistic form: trying to play it off, like that last part of convo didn't happen. The next step of crazy-making.\n\nI ripped him a new one and called him out again. Quoting him verbatim and all we had literally just discussed, throwing back that cheap compliment in his face. That I just tried to call him out and he took to it like a little bitch. I noted that he was sounding exactly like narcs in the past that had gas-lighted and abused me. Did he apologize? Nope. Of course not. Engage next step: blame shifting. All he could say was that he didn't mean to make me think and feel that way, putting all the blame on my own perception and disowning any responsibility for it. \n\nI made sure to let him know he was continuing yet again to follow the pattern of narcissistic behavior and abuse. How does he respond? By asking me if I saw him as one of them. He's testing my good will and trust with that one. While I admitted that I didn't want to, he was following that pattern of behavior. The boot fit. Only then does he call it a night, waive responsibility for my feelings again (with a fake air of sincerity and concern), and end off with an apology. I've never heard \"sorry\" come from a narc's mouth, but don't you dare think I don't know better. He was using that apology in a way that would make me feel bad enough to excuse his shitty behavior. I did not yield. I called him out on that too, and he quit messaging me, just like that. And you can bet your sweet ass that if he messages me again at any point in time, I'm not giving him a damn thing. No response, nothing. I owe that bastard nothing.\n\nWhat fucks me up from all this is the trust issues and dissonance it creates inside my own filter of reality. Apologies are suspect to being plot devices to illicit pity out of me, without any remorse to back it up. He even seemed to demonstrate empathy early on, but now, I realize it was just mirroring. If only that didn't affect my ability to believe in actual empathy others might display. And compliments are ploys for smoothing things over. My sense of good will is shell-shocked! And it's hard to feel like I can even trust myself to know what's real and what's not.\n\nI feel broken, and if my health insurance covers enough, I'm going to start therapy. Narcissists are the bane of society itself, and I wish them nothing short of what any and all of them deserve to the worst possible degree. And it's turned me into such a rabid creature against them..... When memories from any of them riles me up, I genuinely wish I could know how much better I could possibly feel, had they never entered my life. They've stolen so much peace from me....

At the time, I somehow thought this was exciting, bonding with my brother. However, I knew it was wrong deep down. That\u2019s why I made sure to not be too loud. So my brother didn\u2019t get in trouble. One night, my dad came into my brother\u2019s room during one of those nights and I hid in the closet. I didn\u2019t want to get my brother in trouble.

My other brother (A), who was 6 years older than me, came into my room and asked me if anything inappropriate or bad had happened and asked me if my other brother (S) touched me. I said no because I didn\u2019t want to get anyone in trouble. From what I remember, nothing ever happened again. And now I\u2019ve lived with this dark secret for about 15 years.

I do apologize if it seems all over the place. \n\nI met my NEX on a dating app after going through a really rough divorce. I had been single for a while and was trying to get back out there. Anyway, we talked back and forth for a few weeks before actually meeting and going out to dinner. That night was perfect, we had dinner, took a romantic stroll by the lake and sat under the stars for hours. \n\nThe relationship was going great. We both wanted the same things. We both have great careers and aspirations for a family. She has 3 wonderful kids who I fell in love with immediately. They had been through a previous trauma that I was able to relate and connect with them about. I was perfect for her and the kids. I was everything she ever wanted. \n\nA few months in, I started noticing little changes here and there. Snide remarks and comments about me. Trying to trigger a reaction as if I had done something wrong. She started stalking my social media daily. Keeping track of the amount of followers or friends I had. Then accused me of wanting someone else. At one point she timed how long it took me to come home from the office. We were living together at the time and spent every moment away from work together. \n\nOver time the accusations continued. I would constantly confess my love and adoration for her and the kids only to be shunned. She treated me as if I was less than her. She treated me like one of her employees. In the beginning we had so much in common, but as time went on, I realized that she was only mimicking me to draw me in. She love-bombed me. \n\nShe showed me everything she knew I wanted only to hold it over my head. \n\n(I had never met a narcissist before, nor knew how to identify one at the time.)\n\nWe had our ups and downs. Constantly going from great to horrible. I was constantly apologizing and taking the blame every time she acted out. I was continually seeking approval and validation from her. \n\nI was loved by her when I was \u201cgood\u201d. I was devalued and discarded every other time. We eventually split up only to get back together a few weeks later when she was back to her normal self like the beginning. \n\nA few months after reconciling, her actions repeated. This time I tried even harder to fix everything. I did all that was asked of me and then some. I would spend obscene amounts of money to take care of her and the kids. After 4 months I ended up alone again. Discarded like the days trash. I am a disappointment, not worthy of love or affection. I am no good for her. \n\nAt this point I have no other choice but to move out. While trying to find a place to go, she went back to treating me well. We would text back and forth and each time the conversation soured. Shifting what was a normal conversation into the blame game. Telling me that I am the reason for all of her problems. Never taking responsibility for her own actions... again. \n\nI moved out and did right by her and the kids. I paid the months rent, utilities, cell phone bill, and internet so she would have time to switch everything into her name. \n\nIt\u2019s been just over 2 months since I have had any contact with her and almost 3 since I have seen her face. \n\nHere\u2019s where the hard part hits for me. I fell in love with a narcissist. I fell in love and allowed myself to be emotionally, mentally, and spiritually abused. I was terrified to move on. I didn\u2019t know who I was other than a shell of my former self. I was scared. \n\nThe worst part is that I\u2019d grown so accustomed to the abuse that I didn\u2019t/don\u2019t know how to live without it. \n\nTherapy helped, medication took the edge off. I focused my energy on picking up the pieces of my former self and putting my life back together. \n\nAnger is the stage I am at now. Angry for how I let someone treat me the way she did. Angry for not standing up to her or leaving sooner. Angry that she still exists and will repeat this process over and over. \n\nI will heal and I will move on.

The next morning i didnt say anything. I just got up to go to the bathroom and felt numb even though blood was running down my leg still.

And it always hurt, the pain never stopped.

So all four of us hanged out and we all went to bed, in the same room, boyfriend and i on the bed and my friend and his friend were on the floor. Now my friend wasnt a saint and they started having sex beside us, my boyfriend found it as a turn on, and i snapped. I was disguisted that i wanted to sleep and he didnt stop when i said no, i tols him no, and he kept going.\n\nI threw myself out of the bed, and in my bottles up rage, i grabbed his friends hair and dragged him outside, my friend and my boyfriend following behind me.

He immediately treated me like dirt. So much so his own 3 children stopped coming to see him because they hated seeing the way he treated me. This was confirmed by his eldest son a few years ago.  Let's call \"step dad\"  BEAST. The beast would make \"jokes\" of how I was cinderella. He would make me clean, do constant chores, normal for childhood right? Except he was excessive- and if the dishes were not done correctly or something was less than perfect he would pull every dish from the cupboards and make me restart. This went on for years. When my mother wasnt home, his abuse escalated- but working with my therapist- I cannot confirm or deny true allegations and she says I shoudnt wish to.  My mother had 2 children with him unfortunately. As a young teen she finally left him for another man. Because he wasnt my biological father  I wasnt expected to visit him- but I told my mom I wanted to go with my siblings on the weekends to \"protect\" them...the only memory I can 100% confirm is he made me lay in the bed with him, while he was in his disgusting whitey titey underwear and wrapped his disgusting body around me as I laid there and he spooned me and made me watch a movie with him as he rubbed my hair. I remember excusing myself to the bathroom and crying and then coming back out hoping I could lay with my siblings in their bed and he made me lay with him again saying their bed was to full, at the time he was staying in a 1 bedroom apartment. Anyway- after a few months he got a girlfriend and I stopped going the weekends. I told my mom he wouldnt do anything to his own kids and didnt need to go anymore. He tried for a few weeks to get me to come and then it was like I had cut him. I was then cut out of his life- I wasnt the sister to his kids because half siblings is nothing like full blood. I wasnt anything to them. He began trying to poison them against me. Thankfully we had every other weekend together and  my siblings knew how much  i loved and protected them. There was 10 years between my younger siblings and I...so At 16 when I met my husband, I left. I didnt leave the town, just my moms house. I still would get my siblings on the weekends that my mom had something going on- summers they would spends weeks with me and their holiday breaks...but what I didnt realize was the mental abuse being fed to them from their dad while they were with him. My mom and I were trash, disgusting people, Im awful to my children, I only use them to babysit my kids and thats why I want them to come over not to see them but to USE them...awful things. I love my siblings like they are my children. I helped protect them (way more than my mother ever did- there are so many extras that I left out for the point of this thread) I helped raise them. I loved them, I cheered them at every school thing when my mom no showed, My husband and I coached their sports teams- we did all we could to show we loved them. Flash forward to a year and half ago- My brother had just graduated highschool. and instead of telling me even a lam excuse as to why he wasnt going to come by anymore, be apart of his nephews make a wish trip (my son is sick) he no shows and begins to ignore me. States I only want him to babysit-  I dont love him, and his reasoning- because the last time he had came over- as soon as he arrived I asked him to baby sit our younger child while my husband and i took our sick child to the hospital- OUR SICK CHILD WITH A LIFE THREATENING DISEASE. and he now hates us for that- our younger sibling says it was their dad- always telling them over and over again we just wanted to use them and it finally broke him. I tried for a year and half- texting him with i love you, come over and see your nephews, we miss you, lets hang, go to the movies, etc. no response- he hated me for something i didnt even realize was possible- to me- it was family helping family. i needed my little brother that day to help me while I took my child to the hospital and now he hates me for them. \n\nFlash Forward to today- My wonderful ex step dad is now going after my relationship with my sister. He broke my brother and I and now he has set his focus on her and I.  She is currently living with me as she is pregnant and she has a baby already...He turned her away when she was pregnant and homeless- I took her in- despite everything on my plate with my family....and he has the nerve to now try and break our relationship- because thats her daddy she still goes and sees him, and all he and his wife does is talk about me and my family. My sister hates it, and she knows how hurt i am about everything and she just wants to be impartial but I am so angry that he couldnt just let me be. why does he now want to destroy the only relationship i have left with my sister?!!? Im so angry. Im so hurt. If he breaks her the way he did my brother- I will be so broken. After my brother and me stopped talking- I went through hell...literally. I contemplated suicide. I knew I wouldnt because of my babies- but I was so broken over my relationship with him thats where I was....and now he wants to destroy my relationship with my sister.\n\nHow do I stop it? How do you shut down someone who has had the upperhand and control your whole life? They are picking off your relationships one by one? \n\nIm broken, scared, and so angry- getting so angry to the point I dont want to do anything stupid because I have so much hate for him.", "subreddit": "abuse"}

With my older sister this one is very very very fuzzy, I was 5-6 years old but I can clearly recall me and her going to bed (we shared a bed, our other siblings did too when we were young) and I remember her telling me \"this is how girls kiss\" or \"this is how lesbians kiss\" or something like that and then proceeded to give me a peck on the lips. I remember feeling very uncomfortable because I am from a religious family so we never (to this day) ever discuss anything sexual whatsoever. I keep telling myself maybe I imagined it and this is a false memory but I can't get it out of my head!! \n\nThe other with my father I'm 100% sure occurred but im not sure how far he went with it. I was a daddy's girl so I always slept in my dads bed with him whenever I got the chance(my younger brother sometimes did too). I always felt so safe and loved when I fell asleep in his arms and I did continue sleeping with him(not sexually like literally just sharing a bed) even after this incident bc I didn't think anything of it. He was asleep (or so I thought) and I was still awake. I was maybe 10-11years old and I was about to fall asleep laying on my back when he flipped over and slipped his hand down my pants and under my underwear. It was pitch black in the room and I was kind of confused but he was feeling my vagina almost like he was looking for something? There was no penetration. I just stayed there completely still staring into the darkness not knowing wtf was going on not moving a muscle bc I thought maybe he was still asleep or something. It was like maybe 10-15 seconds of this before he pulled his hand out and seemingly went to bed. I though it was strange in my gut now that I look back on it but I just went back to sleep then. \n\nThe next day I remember laughing with my siblings in the living room while my dad was there and I was like \"Hahaha, dad put his hands down my pants last night it was weird.\" I remember he said he thought I was one of the boys and jokingly laughed it off and it was literally never brought up again ever. Again we are a super religious family so I don't know what everyone was even thinking... Anyways, has anyone experienced fuzzy (or not so fuzzy) memories o things like this and if so, how should I go about this? I don't currently see a therapist but I feel like I should bc I really can't bring it up with anyone else. I'm afraid if I do everyone will accuse me of lying or say it didn't happen bc it was a really long time ago. But I couldn't have just created these memories from nothing so I don't know what to do with these things that happened in the past. I am now 21 years old.\n\nTLDR; fuzzy memories of inappropriate touching as a child that I tried to repress and thought were false memories but are in fact reality.

One day I got tired of him treating me that way and I tried to hit him back. Big mistake. He hit me even harder and even busted my lip. I will always remember that day because I was crying in my bed and neither my mom nor my sister came to console me. Long story short I hated my father and at one point I even didn't want to call him dad anymore but my mom told me that I had to because he was still my dad. \n\nEventually my dad stopped drinking and he stopped hitting us but the damage was done.

That's the main reason i feel as if what i went through isn't really abuse; it was a friendship, we didn't have sex, we didn't live together, we weren't romantically together. Still, he was the closest person i've ever had to me. I loved him like i loved few people in my life. I trusted him with my life, and we both always said \"if we were both gay we'd absolutely be together\" (very dude bro thing, and it's also funny cause i'm bi but i hadn't figured that out at that time).\n\nHe'd call me names constantly because of quirks and the way i speak about things i like (psycho, freak, retard). He did those sorts of ego hurting jokes all of the time in front of our friends, despite me telling him i didn't like it multiple times as well. He'd threaten me with physical violence, threaten to punch me when i called him names in response, or when i'd do the same sort of joke back to him, or just generally when he felt ego hurt by me for any reason. He'd go  with me in school projects and drag his feet, leaving everything on my lap to do, and i'd do it because, well, i'm a control freak anyway, i like doing things on my own (despite that overload triggering self hatred, depression and suicidal thoughts on me as time went on). Only positive thing i can remember him doing for me was complimenting my compentence with the projects, but even that was inconsistent. Sometime i'd show a drawing of mine to him and he'd just shit on it and make me doubt my capacity. \n\nHe had a pretty shitty domestic situation, and i'd always be there to hear him out and give him advice when he had to vent, but he'd always leave me hanging when i was the one going through a bad time. Or even when he had doubts about his future; he's now going to the college course \\*i\\* advised him to go to, but he never had anything to say even to make me feel better.

I'm starting with a little backstory. \n\nWhen I was 6/7/8 I had a friend who was a year older than me and she started to want to teach me things about sex and show me things during sleepovers, etc.  She did it a lot and I remember having very mixed feelings about it and it caused a lot of confusion throughout childhood.  \n\nThen my 30 year old brother who had been in prison my whole life got out and lived with us when I was 9 or so.  I was excited and so proud of my big brother because he \"became Born Again Christian\" got married, had children and was a very loving brother and *very touchy feely*. I didn't like the touching. It was not sexual but I'm not a physically affectionate person. I always tried to accept his touching because I didn't wanting to feel rejected. \n\nIn my teenage years I rebelled against christianity and started smoking weed and partying. When I was 21 my dad passed away after a 20 year battle with cancer and I was grieving.  My brother logged into my dead dads Facebook and sent me a message along the lines of \"I know what you do when you're not home... you shouldn't be hanging out with those bad people and partying\"... it scared me and I had some bitterness build up.  Then he began to try to talk to me about smoking weed... he pulled out a pipe and started smoking it and told me to smoke with him. He was hiding it from his wife and the rest of our family.  I usually resisted smoking with him but he was extremely pushy.  I had no desire to smoke with him. It was something I did on my own time to escape the dysfunction of my family and the grief.  He started coming to my moms house when I was alone there and coming into my bedroom to get me to smoke. He stole my weed and bowl in an effort to take away my option, he called me:\n\n\"Arent you missing something?\"\n\"No....\"\n\"I took your stuff out of your room. You need a better hiding spot. Come smoke it with me, I'm outside\" \n\nThis happened a lot and I would resist over and over again and finally give in. I smoked with him one sunny day in my moms backyard, we were alone at the house and I was wearing a skirt down to my ankles and a tank top.  He started to be touchy with me, rubbing my back and then he took my hands and stood up, pulling me up. He wrapped his arms around me and I hugged him back. I felt uncomfortable but I always tried to accept his affection because I knew it was how he wanted to show his love for me.  Then he reached his hand between us and stretched the waist band of my skirt open to look down my dress. He said \"hmm, pink underwear\" and I broke free of his arms and calmly walked towards the house.  I was in complete shock and horror.  I said \"bye\" as nicely as I could and went inside and locked the door behind me.  I went into my room and sat on the bed.  And my world fell apart. \n\nI found a place to live quickly, I stopped smoking weed because I started to have panic attacks every time I did and I just became an anxious mess... and my family life has very much fallen apart.  I started to have severe paranoia about my family.  \n\nThe biggest problem now is that I did tell my mom and my sister a couple months after this happened and I recieved no support.

We eventually were only friends, despite the weird mix-up in feelings at the start of talking. His partner at the time said it would be a great idea to write to him, but I never did. \n\nThings fell out of course, because things got real bad between everyone involved. Months later (half a year)  after I blocked him everywhere, he reached out to apologize about things which I rejected and blocked again...  It was a hard thing to do because I sometimes wish I could\u2019ve accepted and tried again. But my partner at the time had big problems with him (they both did NOT get along because they used to live together). The guy even said how he couldn\u2019t be my friend again because I was just involved with someone he \u201cwasn\u2019t compatible with.\u201d He felt betrayed somehow because he knew me before my bf did (even though he ghosted me like half the time we knew each other so he really didn\u2019t know me long). \n\nAfterwards he started to accuse me of being a stalker etc because I guess I incidentally make friend requests to someone he was friends with?? Even though we had a similar social circle from when we were friends. I get suggestions based on mutual friends.\n\nIt freaked me out for a while because he was talking a lot about taking legal action (even though I now know there was literally nothing he could do because I did nothing and I\u2019m in another country. He\u2019s from Canada, I US). \n\nDespite all this...I sometimes still feel inclined to reach out. I go through cycles where I think, maybe he wasn\u2019t so bad after all. Maybe things are better. Maybe we can try again. I end up falling for the idea of him all over again. I don\u2019t know what side to fall on. \n\nI still ache to somehow know him as a person because we related to each other a lot and I looked up to him. He told me he thought of me as a younger version of himself and that\u2019s why he often felt protective and offered advice etc. \n\nI just wonder if I need to continue to push him away or if it\u2019s safe and ok to reach out again. \n\nI\u2019m trying to consider the pros and cons and scenarios if I did send a letter, and I\u2019m sure it would cause more anxiety in my life if anything... Because who knows how he\u2019d twist my words. There\u2019s a lot of trust issues. If I knew all the right things to say, I would say them just so he understands. \n\nBut I feel like it\u2019s maybe a bit selfish of me. The last time we spoke was early January of this year when he reached out to me. That caused me to spiral because I had finally come to terms with the treatment and I felt detached. Literally that night I felt calm thinking about it and wrote some about how I felt and let go. But then I got those messages and it literally made me sick to my stomach from panic. I\u2019d only be doing the same thing to him. Which I mean, isn\u2019t it fair ((no)). \n\nI don\u2019t know why I have this longing for him to be somewhere in my life, even at a distance. I don\u2019t know if I have a problem. I\u2019ve been told I\u2019m somewhat codependent and have worked on it which is why I guess I now feel more bold and willing to try again. i got better at setting boundaries for myself. \n\nI\u2019m just down and sad about things again. But I also know somewhere in me, that it\u2019ll always be a toxic relationship because I was often envious of him and the way he presented his life and I somewhat idolized him. And he began to change which was when I began to detach which he didn\u2019t seem to like. \n\nThis is turning into a longer post then initially thought, but I\u2019m just basically unsure of what to do. \n\nI sometimes wonder maybe he was never a narcissist and maybe I really was just young and sensitive to everything that was going around. It was SO chaotic I wouldn\u2019t even know where to begin, the things that went on. I\u2019m 21 now and we first spoke when I was 18 (he 25).  \n\nAnd now that I\u2019m older and had some time, I just don\u2019t know anymore. I should probably just continue to think if it would actually bring anything positive to my life or if it just provokes thoughts and feelings where I\u2019m otherwise a pretty null person due to depression and ADD and losing interest in things and life. So the stress of having him back in my life is at least something to stimulate my brain with, ykno. That\u2019s how I kind of figure it.

Ive forgotten who I used to be, anxiety has become a constant in my life. Ive always had problems with depression, so its easy to think this is normal - that this is just how life is for me. As for now, I always feel like Im standing right on the edge. Looking back I thought this was the one, and I thought we were perfect for each other. It turned out it was a lesson instead, learned in hard ways. I learned Im a codependent. I learned about narcissism. I learned what gaslight is. I learned some people dont feel bad about doing it. I became my relationship, it is all I think about. The feeling of that there is no life for me after this, is the hardest to deal with. Having to go through another breakup with the same person is terrifying because I know how much it hurt those other times. But I look at myself, and see a depressed person who is hiding from other people. Im not moving forward, Im not healing, Im only adding more wounds. Im no longer allowing myself to feel close with anyone, though its what I need the most. I feel like Im doing something wrong, like Im cheating, if I open up to a friend, or think about pursuing a new friendship. The emotional intimacy, even though its only friendly, feels so intimate because its lacking in my romantic relationship. I used to just do things, but now I overthink everything - and everything that could go wrong, instead of what could go right.\n\nThe winter is going to be over soon. The sun will be coming out. I hope I will be in my own apartment by then, a place I can call my home where I feel welcomed. I hope Im doing something I love. I hope Im no longer overworking myself to the point of burning out. I hope Im in the progress of learning to trust again. I hope I one day will be looking back at this as something from the past, and be proud I moved on.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI hope you all enter this new decade with some hope.

You will never be truly listened to.\n4. Narcs will never resolve a conflict as a result, they will continue to repeat.\n5. Narcs will very rarely consider your feelings; and will only do so if it serves them some how.\n6. Narcs will never apologize in an authentic way that acknowledges their behavior or your suffering.\n7. What matters most is how they appear to others.\n8. They will ruin your birthdays and holidays\n9. They will be sullen during  events that are important to you because they are not about them\n10. They will **NOT show up for you** at times when you need a partner the most and will be the fucking worst if you are upset about it.

They  will be dismissive and, at times, even cruel to your pets.\n14. Beyond the initial stages of dating, they will make NO fucking effort to befriend your friends or family\n15. Your value will be diminished to the point of nothingness in their eyes. In fact, mere strangers will hold more weight in their eyes than you will.\n16. They will make you their scapegoat\n17. They  will dump their shame on to you.\n18. You will walk on a lot of egg shells\n19. You will experience the silent treatment\n20.

They will not answer questions directly.\n29. They will never ask you about your day or how you are doing or things that you care about (unless it\u2019s something they  care about.) They just don't give a shit.\n30. You will feel stuck and unable to leave them\n31. They will project their bad behaviors onto you.\n32.

Even small things would lead to getting screamed at for 20-30 minutes straight\n\n\\- When I was probably 6-7 she would threaten to send me to live with another family if I didn't behave, even going as far as to drive me to some random person's house and then telling me to get out of the car cause my new family was waiting for me\n\n\\- Again, when I was probably 7, she would lock me down in our basement in the dark. She knew I hated it because I was afraid of the dark, but the water heater was also down there which scared me, and the fact that our crawlspace was there too, which I thought demons or something lived in there.\n\n\\- Whenever I did bad in school or something similar (B- or lower) she would yell about how I was a worthless piece of shit that would work at McDonald's my whole life.\n\n\\- She was constantly comparing me to my older cousin who was a 4.0 student. I like my cousin, but it made me feel like shit, and I got jealous of her apparent effortlessness with school, even though she very obviously tried very hard in her classes.\n\n\\- I don't think my mom lived the life she wanted, as she constantly tried to live through me. Forcing me to do stuff I didn't want to do like school plays, making me take classes I wasn't interested in, forcing her beliefs on me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI now live with my father as my parents got divorced about 2 and a half years ago. It's a much better situation, and I have since forgiven my mother. I'll never forget what she did to me, but I don't hold a grudge against her. She isn't a very mentally sound person, and her parents emotionally abused her as well. So I can see where she gets it from, but I still had to suffer as a kid. It took me years to figure out why I had anxiety, low self-esteem, and depression. I'm now taking medication for my depression, but I am looking for ways to cure my low self-esteem.

There is almost nothing I want more than to receive love and affection from a woman, but A) I don't feel good enough for anyone, and B) I am terrified of getting rejected. I know that rejection is just part of the process, but that is a form of failure that my brain won't let me attempt to deal with.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI don't know though, just looking for advice.

But is there something wrong with me?\n\nI seem to do this a lot sometimes, I seem to push my boyfriend despite the warnings, I seem to be a dick when we argue, is there just something wrong with me or something?\n\nI'm scared if we argue again or if I do something stupid, or make him just think that I don't love him even more. I'm alone in person honestly and have personal stuff,\n\nI only have friends online rather than in person from me being home schooled, I'm gonna go to summer school but I'm just so alone. I have nothing to really do in person either, I'm super shy to talk to anyone in person without getting nervous constantly to approach someone, I talk about negative stuff a lot because it's the only interesting that that I have to talk about other than stuff that will just last a few seconds.\n\nAgain, Is there just something wrong with me? I know I'll get friends in person soon if I try socializing this time in summer school, but how can I just not let myself get like this again?\n\nI get jealous from thinking about my boyfriend's past with other girls which makes me bring it up even if he rarely talks about it, I seem to like being a douche to him partially, I make him think that I don't love him, so is there just something wrong with me?..", "subreddit": "survivorsofabuse"}

He changed he was rude and snippy and complete opposite of what he was when we first met. I kept wanting him to change back but he didn\u2019t so I broke up with him.

He has been texting and want to \u201cwork things out\u201d but he never put in any effort. Yesterday I got tested for an std and came back positive and I told him and the first thing he did was put the blame on me. He didn\u2019t tell the other woman he keeps saying he wants to get tested and that it would be funny if I came back positive and him negative. A friend of mine sent the other woman a  message asking her to get tested. Within minutes of that message going out he was blowing up my phone with calls and texts.  When I finally did pick up he claimed I was ignoring him and that I was stalking the other woman and everything under the sun.

I honestly don't know. I'm 28 years old now, but this happened when I was in sixth grade. Something I've always had in the back of my mind as to whether I was a victim or a bad spoiled rotten to the core kid.\n\nWhen I was in the middle of my sixth grade year (and must have been barely 11 years old), my family had moved to a brand new home. I was the baby in a family of four, and I have quite a big age gap with my oldest sibling, my sister who is 13 years older than me. She must have been no older than 25 years old at the time. She had a boyfriend since high school and he was 25-26 years old at the time. I'm gonna call him Harry. I had known Harry since I was in elementary school, for as long as she had been dating him in high school. He was always very playful, really daring, kind of a trouble maker and I guess thats what she liked at the time. \\*This was the late 90s so I guess it was a thing to be really rebellious since the whole post grunge thing. Anyway, they stayed together since high school and when she was 25 she became pregnant by him.\n\nAt the same time of her pregnancy we moved to a brand new house and because she was pregnant (and he was a low life) he was allowed to stay over our new house. At around this time I was 11 years old now and I was a spoiled kid, being the baby and all, and I remember feeling jealous that my sister was pregnant. I wanted to be the baby was my mentality. My older sister has always been the most loving person, she doesn't know about any of this. So she wanted to comfort me when she was pregnant, because of the large age difference she was like a 2nd mother figure to me. Her boyfriend was always around, mostly because he didn't have a real job. And she was pregnant.\n\nI had always been really playful kid, and I don't know how it started but we started to play a game of me running up to him and spanking him and then I would run away. It seemed silly, I didn't think anything of it. Then it slowly turned into him spanking me back and lightly patting my crotch. I knew in the back of my 11 year old head he shouldn't be patting me anywhere near my crotch but I still didn't want to say anything. I didn't want to get into trouble. But I didn't stop either. One day we were watching a film on the couch. We only had 1 couch because we had recently moved into the house and we didn't bring in our remaining furniture from storage yet. It must have been Winter because I remember it was raining outside and we had a big blanket we shared as we watched the couch. We were playing our \"game\" when I don't remember how it happened but I touched his crotch. And then I kept touching and remembering it got hard. And then I just remember feeling it under the blanket and we both knew what was going on. And then he pulled out and showed it to me. I was shocked because it was so big and I had never seen a penis in my life. Afterwards, the movie ended and I went to bed. He was going to sleep over in an extra bedroom that was empty (but on the floor since we had literally moved in and didn't have a bed for that room) just because my sister was pregnant at the time and my parents said it was fine. I guess they figured he had already gotten her pregnant, whats the worse that could happen? Well I said good night to him that night, and although he was set up to sleep, he suddenly left the house around 1am. My mom asked him why ? was it because he was uncomfortable? etc. (My mom is super nice and hospitable) but I don't remember what he told her. I was up at these hours because of winter break. Even as a kid I was a night owl.\n\nAfter that they broke up because he was cheating on my sister and his mistress came to our home to confront them. She thought our home belonged to him. Little did she know it was my sister's parents, the truck he was driving was my sisters, and he was a loser.\n\nSomething I connected was that he was a piece of shit yes, but also he must have left that night to cheat on her. I remember he had an erection.\n\nThe worst part of this story is that I don't remember feeling bad as a little girl doing that. I liked it. I was scared but enticed. He was really handsome, tall, and funny. I had a little kid crush on him. Am I a bad kid? Was I little bitch for doing that? I don't understand why I didn't feel bad?\n\nI never told anyone. He didn't either (obviously). And thankfully they broke up and I never saw him again. Maybe I've seen him three times after I was 12 years old until now. He doesn't visit or exist as a father figure in my newphews life. SO I don't see him ever.\n\nI don't know whats wrong with me. Was that abuse? Was that just a horny kid getting into trouble? I know I caused it on myself. I just want to leave this thought in this decade.\n\nIts not something thats \"haunting\" me Its just something that I wonder about from time to time.", "subreddit": "survivorsofabuse"}

He then threatened to just show up at my house and someone better be here or there will be problems. I can not explain how anxiety inducing this situation is \n\nI guess I\u2019m just wondering if he could have left the tv at my house and knew all along what his plan was by doing that? Does anyone have any similar stories of hoovering attempts like this? Thanks so much guys this sub helps me a lot.", "subreddit": "NarcissisticAbuse"}

{"post_id": "ehzk47", "created_utc": 1577776408, "title": "My grandma abused me and my sister leaving me with unhealthy coping habit", "author": "Hairstolickandsniff", "self_text": "I've vividly remember some details but the other details I've been told by mom. I have a really close relationship with my mom and she doesn't shield me from the truth and has no qualms about putting me in my place or correcting me when I'm wrong. These details I provide you are from memory, my mother and also my sisters memory.\n\nWhen I was 4 my mom and dad had work scheduling problems. We just moved into a new home, my sister was 5 and I was 4 so it was hard for mom and dad to schedule their work around our care. I was in preschool and my sister started kindie so my dad's mom \"Grandma H\" offered to pick me up after pre school and my sister after kindie and mind for the 4hrs until mom was home from work. This was every Wednesday and Friday. The other days mom was off work so our arrangement with Grandma H wasn't that overwhelming. My parents paid Grandma H plus she offered her help as she worked as a nanny all her life.\n\nI remember Grandma H dunking the spoon in her hot boiling tea cup and sticking the spoon to the back of my hand. She would chuckle laughing at me yelping in pain. She would then ask my sister to recite the national anthem. If she got one word wrong she would have to stand up against the wall. She treated me differently and it may be because of being a boy. I'm not saying what my sister went through wasn't abuse either but I was the one who received most of the pain. \n\nI can remember one day having a tummy bug and my mom wanting to take off work to look after me but grandma H insisted on caring for me. When I got sick she forced my head down into the toilet bowel and I can remember choking on my own vomit and I peed myself. She had me sit with no clothes on beside the cold patio door. She left me alone while she went to pick my sister up. I was 4yrs old and I was naked and alone. My sister was extremely worried for a 5 Yr old, she ran in the door, spotted me and ran toward me. She didn't care about getting in trouble. \n\nGrandma H would dish out threats. She knew I was afraid of dogs and she knew my sister was afraid of clowns so she would play Stephen Kings IT and Cujo, and threaten that they were her friends and if we told anyone they would get us and kill our parents and friends. Those movies were too much for our little minds. I used to sneak into my sisters room and we would huddle together in bed for fear of Cujo or pennywise. \nMy mother grew increasingly concerned about our behaviour. We became lethargic from not sleeping and basically withdrawn. \n\nGrandma H forced us to watch Christine another Stephen king film. It was about a Car that was possessed and killed people. My sister and I cried our eyes out. My grandma said that she owned Christine now and if we ever gave reason for concern to mom again that Christine was coming. Every time me and my sister would hear a car engine running or a beep we would basically shit ourselves. \n\nThe abuse got worse when I turned 5 and joined kindie with my sister. Grandma H would pick us both up. She drove like a maniac for two kids in the car. One day she got stopped by a cop and complained to the officer that her grandson (me) was sick and she was rushing to get home. He was lenient and just issued her a warning with no ticket. When she pulled in the drive she turned around to us snarling and said \"Even the cops love me, you little runts best behave\". \n\nThe extent of my abuse was being burned with the back of the scalding spoon, a sponge being stuffed in my mouth, putting mustard on my tongue, forcing me to eat margerine from the tub until I was sick, smacking me with a newspaper across the head, my grandma physically crouching over me and urinating all over me then telling my mom I wet myself again. \n\nMy sister basically had to do everything Grandma H said. She was basically forced to learn or do chores. I received the physical abuse. She was clever never to leave a mark. Even the welt from the spoon would pass by the time it was home time. I blocked most of the torture out but my sister remembered lots. I blocked out a time that my sister could recall Grandma H forcefeeding me  her dead goldfish. My sister has PTSD when she sees a goldfish. I apparently had to chomp it alive and my sister said my face was covered in scales. \n\nMy mom grew increasingly worried about why I was urinating. I was also saying weird things in school that my teachers would pick up on, they noticed my sister would be saying things too and the things we were saying were so outlandish that they remembered it. They knew we were siblings and had become concerned that we were being exposed to adult material in our home. We were reciting explicit lines from the horrors we were forced to watch. My teacher became concerned when my sister started screaming that she didn't want to float when we had balloon day at kindie. \n\nMy parents were called into the school and there was an investigation of some type because I remember being asked to a private room with toys and there was a nice lady who helped me draw how I was feeling and what I was scared of. She told me that it was a magic zone and anything I said was secret and nobody will ever get in trouble. My innocent mind asked would Cujo get me or pennywise and the lady assured me that they wouldn't. She didn't scold me or shut me down. So I began to reveal detail after detail about Grandma H. \n\nMy sister had similar if not far more detailed accounts of what went on inside Grandma H' home. My mother and father were devastated. I remember my sister and I had to stay with these nice Christian folk for a fortnight until everything was sorted by the police. Of course I didn't understand back then. My parents told my sister and I that we were going on a holiday so that the cops and them will fight off the monsters forever. That's what my mom told us and we were so happy. We had a great time in the countryside playing and getting messy. \n\nWhen it was time to come home, my parents wept and kept us close in their arms. My mom even quit her work and got a new job from home. She basically became so present with us that our bond with her was unbreakable. We never seen Grandma H again. It wasn't until my sister became extremely inquisitive and started to ask questions about the time of Grandma H that we all sat down as a family and discussed everything. \nMy parents way of coping with the trauma was by pretending it never happened and that was fine but I probably should have received some sort of therapy. \n\nMy grandma pleaded insanity and was put into psychiatric facility for 2 years. When she got out she apparently tried to contact my dad again but he was having none of it. She died when I was 11 so we didn't go to her funeral or see her grave. She was erased from our lives by our parents. My parents probably thought that because we were so young it wouldn't have had a lasting impression. My sister was strong and she moved on quite quickly from it all but I found ways to cope with the trauma and that was eating my hair. \n\nMy mother noticed I was getting bald spots and she brought me to the family doctor and he gave my mother a DVD. It was a cartoon on how to tackle bad habits. There was kids on it sucking their thumb or biting their nails. I was really embarrassed when my mom sat me down and asked me to watch it with her. It was so childish and weird. I just felt humiliated so I stopped pulling out my hair from my head and began looking for hair to munch on or objects that were furry or hairy. \n\nI did all this in secret. I went through hair brushed, combs, the drains, toilet seats and the shower. I even stuck my finger in the back of the family hairdryer and pulled out some charred hairballs. I loved finding hair. I didn't care where it came from. I would roll it up in a ball and chew it. Or if the hair was long I would play with it between my fingertips and feel it, then I would lay it on my tongue and roll it around in my mouth until it was matted then swallow. I would lick my sisters barbie dolls like a mama cat would lick their kitten. My sister caught me one day and was really pissed off with me and threw the Ken Doll at my head, that ended in ER and Stitches above my eyebrow. \n\nMy grandma on my mom's side was really nice but she liked her fashionable pieces for her house. She bought a faux bear skin rug. She lived a couple of hours away so our visits with her would end up the whole family staying a weekend with her. I was 12 and getting curious about my body and sexuality that weekend I would sneak down to that rug and hump it, and I would suck on the fur. \n\nMy grandma noticed that the rug was getting matted and she was really dissatisfied with the retailer. She even put a complaint forward in the department store she purchased it in. They sent her out a new one. I didn't dare touch the new one. I didn't know what was going on with my body and I unfortunately ejaculated in the old one that lead to the matting too not just my saliva. \n\n\nI would say my behaviour with my hair addiction stemmed from the abuse. My coping mecahsim was hair and then it turned sexual when I reached puberty. I am unsure why. I am still looking for answers as to why the childhood abuse made me turn to hair to cope but then turned sexual. I can't function throughout my day without partaking in hair gathering /hunting rituals and having sexual relations with my hair finds. It is honestly comforting but my addiction has reached it's peak recently. \n\nI felt like with the new release of the IT movies my addiction had gotten worse and from then has spiralled now to a dangerous level. I am willing to break the law to gain access to discarded wax strips. That is what I've become. I feel like my grandmother is still alive and taunting me from the side lines. I recognise that I probably should have got therapy from day one but my parents felt like they were doing the right thing of trying to erase our traumas by over compensating us with attention. Although our bond is fantastic as a family, I feel like my behaviour is the one thing that would hurt my family more than anything and I don't ever want them finding out, I just want to be better. \n\nAnyway, thanks for listening. \u2665 X O \u2665", "subreddit": "abuse"}

Though it wasn't long before he complained about his previous roommate having a bad temper, because he was offended by all the Hitler books, and him talking about it.  I guess that was a bad sign but I wasn't picky because it was only a temporary place in my mind, a few months (I told him I was only planning to stay for a few months and he said it was fine).  He said no lease and no deposit too.  Oh yeah he's over 80 years old and I'm in my early 40s.\n\nAnyway I'm here now.  There's a few signs that really bother me.\n\n\\- Didn't show me his ID, though I initiated and showed him mine when we first agreed I could move in.  Put my name on the rent receipt but not his, until I pointed it out.  I've seen two different names visible on the outside of mailed bills, and he's used the first names with different people.  I think he has credit rating problems because he told me stories about how badly he was treated by one of the companies, and didn't pay a bill that keeps mounting up.\n\n\\- Remembering how good he was to me but forgetting how I reciprocated when he wants to complain.  He offered to pick me up at the airport when I got back, I brought back some tea for him worth about 3 airport taxi rides.  I helped him with technical stuff around the house.  I left the Internet on for him for almost two months while I was away (I'm paying of course).  He took me to a couple places around town like groceries or the government office.  His VCR broke down so I found one and drove 300 km (the day after I got a car) to surprise him with a nice Christmas gift.\n\n\\- He does seem to have a good memory, he remembers details of our interactions that I didn't really care about.  He tells a lot of stories from his past and present with good detail, hard to tell though because he repeats them to people (I can hear him telling the same stories in the next room over the phone).  I do know he embellishes because he told me one after it happened (saying a guy swiped his car in the parking lot before getting away), then tried to tell me the same story (a couple times) where he met the guy in the parking lot and told him off, but stopped himself realizing I heard the original.  Anyway he's quite proud of his memory and flaunts it.\n\n\\- Some really awful stories that he thinks are hilarious, like calling women ugly or making crude sexual remarks towards them that he sees in the grocery store if they cough or say nothing really.  I saw a little of this firsthand when a woman was backing out of a tight spot in a crowded ad hoc farmer's market parking lot (the kind where people park where they probably shouldn't, including him).  Her friends were helping her spot the corners of her vehicle when he made a remark.  I had no idea what he was even angry about, they kind of ignored him and frowned, it was embarrassing.\n\n\\- Some really offensive opinions about women in general, Hitler, Jews, and many other races, although he thinks all races are great except his own (ha!... ?).  Funny thing is it seems like race is mentioned in most conversations.\n\n\\- A lot of things he says and does seem like they are designed to provoke a reaction.  Like the awful stories and opinions, looks of disdain.  And many of the stories themselves are about how he did provoke a reaction by saying something terrible and totally unnecessary to a friend or stranger, and told off the person, and he came out looking like a smart prankster or a hero for defending the innocent.\n\n\\- Shutting me down.  He said he wants to hear stories about where I've been but about half the time he ignores me, changes topic, or talks over me.  We had a couple arguments.  I was really triggered by the first one and yelled back, and later I realized, I was angry because I had asked him calmly why he suddenly said how Africans contributed nothing to the world compared to Inuit when I we were talking about diets of the two people.  After I asked him why, a couple times, he talked over me and asked his own question about what tribe it was, repeatedly.  Later I realized it was because he refused to answer my question but demanded an answer to his.  But then he dictates the conversation is over and refuses to speak more about it (until today when he thought it was relevant again).\n\n\\- Belittling.  Nearly everything I say about what I did, he says something about how I did or am doing it wrong, or gives me a look like I'm stupid, trying to cast doubt.  One of his favourite things is to ask a question about an obscure thing he knows the answer to, and either answering his own question, dragging it out or not answering it trying to bait me into asking.  He's insecure about his limited education, he's mentioned a few times about how he could have been so much greater except for the war.  He will say a guy has womanly behaviour or \"worse than a woman\" but it's clear he does some of those same things himself.\n\n\\- Testing.  He's been leaving the kettle on high heat and it whistles but he should hear it in his room (because my room is just as far away).  Yesterday, I don't know how long it was whistling before I noticed but I thought he would get it.  When I went out he had a crack in his door but it was dark so I didn't know if he was sleeping or in his bathroom or what so I just went to turn it off.  Later when he was trying to point out all my flaws he said if he had a heart attack I would ignore him until I finished what I was doing.\n\n\\- Victimhood.  He's old, he's too nice and people take advantage of him, he's honest and a good person, he had a hard life.  But I've seen him lie about his age for sympathy, he clearly tries to provoke reactions and blame the other person for reacting.  I mean, he is old (it's hard for me to say for sure he's 81 because I didn't see any ID) and worried about end-of-life.  But he's also very alert and a lot of the time he could have easily avoided a problem, but would rather make a big scene about it.\n\nHe does do nice things, like he left a little teddy and panda bear with a pie for the family and baby across the hall for Christmas, semi-anonymously.  He does work to help free the wrongly convicted (he says, and some other legal side work he doesn't share with me).  And he tells some nice stories about interactions with children when he goes out, and he seems really touched by their innocence.\n\nSo, I do have a lot of experience with this type of person from work and generally try to avoid them.  I can see the signs and try to steer the conversation away, smile and nod or even just say nothing, or get busy with something else.  I'm pretty decent at avoiding the bait, and I avoid telling him any details he could use against me, especially anything related to money or my belongings.  Some things get through the cracks though, I don't want him to mess with my plans so this worries me.  After the first week back I just started to decline most offers of help, preferring to walk to the grocery store in the snow/rain until I could get a car.  Anyway I'm not really emotionally invested in him and it's not hard to keep it that way.\n\nBut last night he seemed upset by that too, like I don't care and he's doing me a big favour by being my only friend when I had none (he kind of is but hey I'm new in town).  Honestly I don't want to see him hurt and he seems really sensitive, but the conversations are just draining when I have to keep my guard up.\n\nSome of this sounds like I'm just complaining about an old man.  Like I said though I have a bad feeling (he talks about bad police and how he's known a lot of bad people in his life) and would prefer a graceful exit where he doesn't know where I live.  I'm looking for a place and I told him about one I like, I'm reconsidering it though because although I didn't give an exact address it's not hard to find from what I told him.\n\nThanks for reading up to this point, it was longer than I intended.", "subreddit": "NarcissisticAbuse"}

Miserable. Didn\u2019t have the energy to party like everyone else- I had spent the past week doing Christmas and a wedding with the narcs family and it took a lot out of me. \n\nThis man never wanted to hang out with me. He never wanted to spend a single quiet night in with me unless he was cripplingly hungover.

{"post_id": "ei3mpb", "created_utc": 1577803142, "title": "Sharing my story in hopes of moving forward...", "author": "lovesbrokenstar", "self_text": "Hello all... \n\nI am posting here as a way to help myself to move forward and reach out to others who understand the pain and feelings I am going through. I have never posted before so this is new to me. I don't think I've ever taken the time to articulate everything that has happened to me.\n\nI appreciate anyone who is taking the time to read this because it is a long read... I have to get this off of my chest so that I can begin looking forward.\n\nMy story begins 12 years ago when I was 20 years old. I had just gotten out of an unhealthy on again/off again (over 5 years) relationship with my high school boyfriend and was feeling pretty low. I was highly ambitious, had tons of friends, I was in great shape, I did not lack attention from men (in fact, looking back, much of my validation came from that attention because I was in a very unhealthy state of mind). I had a nice sporty car, made good money, had nice clothes and expensive accessories. My outward self esteem was very high but internally I felt misunderstood in many things; the rejection compounded this which made me feel unworthy of real love and appreciation so I sought superficial attention to soothe my internal wounds.\n\nThis was when MySpace was still a thing and when you expressed yourself and your emotions with a new \"top 8\" or songs playing on your profile. At the time, I had selected \"Iris\" by the Goo Goo Dolls as my profile song because aside from being my favorite song, it described how I was feeling. \n\nI received a MySpace message from the narc for the first time titled \"Iris?\" - it was from an anonymous looking profile and it piqued my interest because it mentioned being from someone who worked closely to me and had admired me for a while and asked me to guess who it was. I guessed it was the cute guy down the hall and I was right. Since I was feeling so rejected, it made me feel good to be \"noticed\" and we started communicating back and forth. He came on very strong, which should have been the first clue. \n\nAfter about a week, he invited me to go out to the movies. At the time, I was working two part time jobs and going to college full time so my schedule was packed for several weeks due to work and exams. I asked if we could wait a few weeks and he agreed. During those few weeks, our messages got more intense and it seemed like he said all the right things. I was so taken aback that someone seemed to understand me and actually cared about what I had to say. I shared and he shared. In fact, he felt that I should know something about him, which was that he had been abused in every way imaginable as a child and had been the victim of a neglectful mother. I felt so sorry for him. He seemed so sweet, kind, and understanding despite all that he had been through. He was so vulnerable and sensitive --- completely different from the other guys I had dated. I was ready for something new and he was it. He did mention several times that I was making him \"wait\" for the movie date but that he was sure it was going to be worth it. Little did I know that I was being groomed for 12 years of relentless psychological abuse that would leave me as a shell of the person I once was.\n\nAt our movie date, he kissed me and confessed his love for me. I didn't think I loved him back, but I felt that if I didn't say it too, he would reject me like all of the others, so I did. On our second date, we began being intimate with each other. The relationship was moving fast... it felt like a runaway train and I felt a little uncomfortable, but pulling back meant that I might lose this \"perfect, sweet, and caring\" man. So I went along with it. \n\nEven though he wasn't \"perfect\" in other senses - he had no car (he didn't know how to drive), very little money, an \"imperfect\" family, was physically out of shape, wore sloppy-ish clothes - I was willing to bring my superficial \"standards\" down for him because I felt that he deserved a break in life and that I needed to start looking beyond the surface. That, and I had been with \"perfect\" guys before and they had treated me badly, so surely this man would see all that I had to offer. I would polish him up and he would start to reap all the benefits that life had to offer. I would save him and he would save me.\n\nI started to push him toward goals like learning to drive and buying a car. The car he bought ended up being a lemon. According to him, if I had never pushed him toward buying a car so fast, he would have done his research and bought a better car. I ended up apologizing and agreeing that I shouldn't have pressured him toward getting a car - my car was enough and I should have seen that.\n\nHe was struggling to pay bills so I suggested he find another part-time job, at least temporarily, so that he could save a little money to take the pressure off. He did but not without making sure that I knew he was doing this for me so he could have extra money to take me out. I felt guilty and apologized for how \"high-maintenance\" I was.\n\nI pushed him to go back to school and pursue his Bachelor's degree so he could get a higher paying job. He did and his work and school schedule began to conflict which caused friction at work. Ultimately, he started getting written up and he had to find another job. If it wasn't for me pushing him to go back to school, he would have never had issues at work and he wouldn't have had to find a new job (which he quickly hated). I apologized for this too.\n\nAfter one of our fights, he stormed out and cheated on me with his ex. He lovebombed the hell out of me to take him back. He promised he wouldn't do it ever again. Over time, the story changed... he would never have cheated on me if it wasn't for the fact that I did this or that... I should have loved him more, understood him more, had sex with him more, etc.\n\nHe was paying an exorbitant amount of rent at his apartment so I suggested that he stay in a rental property my grandparents owned to save some money. They rented it out to him at less than a fourth of what he was paying at the apartment. He saved a good amount and an opportunity to buy a nice, inexpensive house came up. I encouraged him to buy it so that he could have something to call his own and spend his money on a mortgage instead of crazy rent prices. My parents lent him the down payment and he bought the house. We spent months getting it into cosmetic shape so he could move in. The house started to have issues with the air conditioner and the boiler within the next year. He made sure to let me know that if had stayed in the apartments, he would have never have had to deal with these things and that it stressed him out to be a homeowner. He said I could never understand that because I had always had a \"cushy\" life at home where my parents took care of all the issues that arose. For years, any time anything went wrong with the house, he made sure to remind me that he only bought the house because he thought it would make me happy but that it caused him great stress to have to keep up with it and that I should feel bad for that. I ended up begging him to forgive me for suggesting he buy the house and insisting that I was grateful for his sacrifices and efforts.\n\nHe hated every job and could never keep one. I encouraged him to seek out a teaching certificate since teachers have the summer off and I felt his demeanor was good for it. He did and got a teaching job which he was fired from the first year. He was unemployed for a year and I let him borrow thousands of dollars to keep up with his bills (he did pay me back). I felt like I owed it to him and it was the least I could do since he had done all these things for me. He never said thank you. In fact, if I mentioned the money, he would instantly fly into a rage about how I was \"throwing it in his face\" and that he wouldn't be in this position if it wasn't for me. I would always end up apologizing and feeling guilty for \"pushing\" him beyond his capabilities. \n\nAt every new job, he would meet someone new - someone very interesting, someone who made him feel good, someone who understood him. He had several emotional affairs. I was terrified that I would lose my relationship and all of the \"progress\" we had made so it would send me into overdrive. I would promise to love him more, give more, and ask for less each time.\n\nAll the while, I had become isolated from everyone but my family. I lost friends. I gained tons of weight. I rarely went out. I focused almost entirely on him and his needs, which were many.\n\nWe could never, ever talk about marriage or children. He would shut down and if I pressed further, he would detonate and it would spiral into a knock down, drag out fight over anything and everything. He would threaten to leave me and never return during every, single fight.\n\nIn fact, every argument we had had the potential for this. I can honestly say that in 12 years, I never once put my hands on him or disrespected him in any way (name calling, cheating, etc.). I would raise my voice or cry out of frustration but that was it. He on the other hand did the following over the years: called me horrible names, spit on me, lift me over the balcony and threatened to drop me, held a knife to my throat, put his hands around my throat, pinned me to the bed while screaming in my face, shoved me, knocked me down, pushed me out of a car to the ground, punched me in the shoulder. Those are just the times I can think of off of the top of my head. Somehow, each time, he would convince me that it was my fault... if I had just left him alone, stopped talking, not said that, etc. he wouldn't have done it.\n\nHe withheld affection from me, especially sex. He would call me desperate, clingy, or inappropriate. Of course, this was all of my fault. If I had given him all of the sex he had wanted in the beginning of the relationship instead of being busy with work and school, he would be more attracted to me. If I didn't give him such a \"hard time\" he would feel more affectionate toward me. If I wasn't such a bitch, he'd feel more inclined to give me kisses or hugs. Any initiation of affection on my part was met with the following: your hugs tickle me, your kisses are too aggressive, your hair smells weird, your lotion smells too strong, etc., etc., etc.\n\nDuring all of this, I managed to graduate with my bachelor's, go to and graduate from law school, and pass the bar exam.  I got a great job with great flexibility and started making great money. He would spend extended periods unemployed and between odd jobs. All the while, his home was falling in disrepair, his car was falling apart, and he was falling into a deep depression (or so I thought). I bought a house for myself but I was terrified to sleep alone. I had never lived alone and always suffered from severe anxiety. I asked if he would stay with me so I wouldn't be afraid, which he agreed to. The last year, life was a living hell but I held on. He was doing me a huge favor by easing my fears and showing me the ropes of living alone. The least I could do was support him. \n\nIn August, he finally got a full time teaching job again. We were thrilled. Finally, everything was finally going pay off. We were going to sell his house, get married, and have a baby because things were settling down. Within weeks, he started to treat me coldly and he blamed stress. I couldn't understand since my job is so easy and flexible. He was getting home later and later. At this point I was doing everything I could think of to make his life easier so he would feel appreciated and loved. I made dinner, cooked breakfast, made his lunch, washed/folded/ironed his clothes, cleaned the house, mowed the lawn, made sure not to ask for too much, etc. He reached a point where he no longer texted or called me at all and would get home unceremoniously and barely acknowledged me. He refused to kiss me or touch me. This was jarring because this was a man who demanded my attention 24/7 for almost 12 years, and suddenly, it was as if I didn't exist. I was a ghost in my own home.\n\nHe was started to get home after 8 pm every weeknight when work ended around 3 pm. I finally confronted him and he admitted that he had met someone new at work and that she was everything that I was not. She was kind, caring, and had everything in common with him. She understood him. I asked him if he wanted a relationship with this new person, he said that he wasn't sure, but what he was sure of was that life with me was so miserable that he would rather be alone. He said that he was leaving me and if that meant never seeing me again, then so be it.\n\nHe left the following morning with what he could grab before being late for work. To say that I was completely devastated is an understatement. I couldn't bear to be alone in my big, empty house. I left to stay with my parents for a while. I started therapy and the doctor prescribed me anxiety/depression meds. I felt completely void and abandoned.\n\nHe had left behind lots of things of value so I packed them up and asked him to pick them up, which he did. I went no contact and it has been hard because this man was a constant presence in my life for 12 consecutive years. My entire 20's and into my 30's. I felt like I had nothing to offer anyone else...\n\nHe was in a relationship with the new girl within 48 hours. He bought a brand new car. They are living their \"best life\". I know this because I snooped (which I shouldn't have, but I did and now I feel ashamed about this). It feels like he saw me as gum on his shoe, which he stopped to get rid of and then went about his day.\n\nIt's only been about a month and a half since the relationship ended and I have been working hard to find the tools I need to rebuild my life. I have done lots of research and reading and realized that my ex was a covert narcissist. He abused me physically, emotionally, verbally, and psychologically. He would give me crumbs of affection which I took eagerly because I felt like if I didn't I was sure to go hungry and it felt good to be \"loved\" in that moment. It has given me validation to know that it was not me. It was him. All along, it was him. But my pain and trauma is deep and I'm looking forward to the day when I don't feel anything for him anymore. \n\nIt has been hard but the timing feels right. A new year is about to begin and I want to regain my zest for life and my motivation to move forward and upward. \n\nThank you again for taking the time to read this and I appreciate any insight or support you can offer me.", "subreddit": "NarcissisticAbuse"}

I found myself saying that i had gone through abuse to some other people and i'm feeling ashamed, with fear that i'm just playing the victim. This relationship was a friendship that i had throughout high school. That's the main reason i feel as if what i went through isn't really abuse; we didn't have sex, we didn't live together, we weren't romantically together. Still, he was the closest person i've ever had to me. More than any family, more than any other friend. I loved him like i had loved no one in my life. \n\nThing is, he'd call me names constantly because of quirks and the way i speak about things i like (psycho, freak, retard). He did those sorts of ego hurting jokes all of the time in front of our friends, despite me telling him i didn't like it multiple times as well. He'd threaten to punch me when i called him names in response, or  when i'd do the same sort of joke back to him, or just generally when he felt ego hurt by me for any reason. He'd go  with me in school projects  and drag his feet, leaving everything on my lap for me to do, and i'd do it because, well, i'm a control freak anyway, i like doing things on my own (despite that overload triggering self hatred, depression and suicidal  thoughts on me as time went on). Only positive things i can remember him doing for me was a pleasent chat every now and then, and him complimenting my compentence with the projects, but even that was inconsistent. Sometimes i'd show a drawing of mine to him or something else i had done and he'd just shit on it and make me doubt my capacity.\n\nHe had a pretty shitty domestic situation, and i'd always be there to hear  him out and give him advice when he had to vent, but he'd always leave  me hanging when i was the one going through a bad time. I'd also find out after some time that he talked shit about me behind my back to my other friends, which was what made me leave him. They all left with him as well.\n\nThere are a few more things that i'm not being able to  remember, trying to go back to these memories is painful. The worst nightmares i've had this year involved going back to school and having to face him again. The only nightmares in my life in which i woke up from gasping and dripping sweat, thanking God for it being just a dream.\n\nHonestly,  i don't know why i stuck around. Why i loved him so much. Leaving him was extremely painful. It felt like cutting a limb off with a saw.\n\nAnd now i feel like this was meaningless because it was a friendship. I feel like i'm making mountains out of moleholes, even though it's a place of extreme pain for me.\n\nIdk, maybe i'm just seeking validation here.

I am new to this sub but unfortunately not new to narcissism. I dated a classic narcissist two years ago briefly only for about two months before he discarded me. He hoovered me several times over the next year but I came out of that relatively unscathed. I read everything I could about narcs and felt like I had a pretty good understanding and was confident I would be able to spot one again. WRONG.\n\n2019 was an extremely tough year for me. I went through a custody battle with my sons dad and I was in a toxic relationship January to May that I ended. I stayed a tad bit longer than I should have but ultimately knew my worth and got out when things got bad. July I meet a guy on an online dating website. We go out and have an amazing first date. Our second date was even better. He was kind and charming and funny and shy and cute. We saw each other pretty much everyday straight for a week after that and we were off! Things moved really quickly which was my first sign. We introduced our kids to each other, we spent almost every night together. Introduced all our friends. A month in he tells me he loves me. I was absolutely smitten so I say it back. He was everything I wanted. Safe and secure and so sweet and attentive. We start planning to move in together in February when his lease is up. Looking at buying houses. Talking wedding details and sending each other pics of rings. We take road trip to go meet his parents in Arizona. All the while I am ignoring these red flags. Like how he dumped his kids mom after 12 years together out of the blue. Like how no relationship he had since was longer than 6 months and all of them were \"alcoholics or crazy or the problem\". Like how he would make me feel guilty if I wanted to spend time with friends or go to the gym or go to church because he \"missed me so much\" or because \"his boys wanted my boys to come over to hang out\". Like how he never took an interest in anything I liked but expected me to play video games with him and watch football all day sundays and watch all the shows he likes. So I abandon my whole life pretty much, thinking we are building a life together. Queue the codependency issues on my part! Which I haven't always had but he seemed to really trigger them.\n\nAround mid October my 15 year old son starts acting out at school smoking pot and ditching classes. Narc tells me he wants to do whatever he can to make sure we get him back on track so supportive and exactly what I needed at that time. We get back from visiting his parents in another state and everything changes. He is distant, not wanting to spend as much time. When I try to talk to him about my son he says \"I am out of suggestions\". I notice him shutting down. We live about 45 minutes from each other and I was always making the drive to his house never him to mine. The more distant he became the harder I tried to hold on. The more I tried to do for him the more depleted I became because he did not care. We get into an argument because I dare ask what is wrong. He dumps me. We get back together the next day. I walk on eggshells trying not to upset him while he knit picks everything and continues to be distant and tell me nothing is wrong. The next week (week of thanksgiving) he wants to take a break again because he all of a sudden can't see a future with me. He leaves me in a 3 day limbo going back and forth makes a pros and cons list and sends it to me which was mean. All these cons on the list that he literally NEVER mentioned as being a problem before. We get back together. He comes to my family thanksgiving. Then that weekend is his birthday weekend and I have already purchased expensive tickets to a hockey game and made dinner reservations for him and I and his best friends. I suspect he only got back with me that time to still be able to go do all of that stuff. We have an awesome weekend for his birthday. We had none of our four kids and he commented on how nice it was.\n\nAfter his birthday he starts to become distant again and is more irritable about everything. My mental health has taken a nose dive by now. My anxiety is at an all time high because of my kid and because of his gaslighting and anxiety producing behavior such as hanging up on me, not letting me talk, getting angry anytime I mention something that hurts me, blocking my phone number after he hangs up so I can't get in touch and oh so much stonewalling!!! Dec. 6th I call him crying because my son was really rude to me that morning he gets angry and says he doesn't care and he can't be a source of support anymore and he is sick of my issues with my son and he dumps me \"this time for good\" he says.\n\nI call him and beg for him back and go into the negative on my self respect quota. He starts throwing out bread crumbs saying if I can fix my relationship with my son maybe he will consider us getting back together. He asks me to come over. Kisses me tells me he wants to \"date\" and take it slow and try to get back to why we fell in love in the first place. I sleep with him. The next day I try to get clarity on what dating means. He says he wont' be dating or talking to anyone else and it means we are trying to work things out. We go out to dinner a couple days later and he is hiding his phone but checking it often. I ask if he's seeing or talking to a new woman he says yes, an old person from his past reached out regarding his new facebook single status. I get upset, say I don't want to be strung along. He gets mad that I am upset and says he's not stringing me along. We leave the restaurant and he takes me home asks for all his stuff back is cold and cruel and blames everything on me just because I was trying to stick up for myself.\n\nSince then, he has said he was coming to give me my stuff back and not shown up, not taken my calls or responded to my texts to get my stuff, told me that I couldn't give his kids the Christmas presents I got for them, deleted any trace of me whatsoever off his facebook like I never existed and just been generally rude. We talked two days ago after NC for a week and he plays the hero card. Saying he did this for me so I could focus on my relationship with my son and because my mental health was declining (duh you're emotionally abusing me!) and he sacrificed his own happiness so I could have a happier life. He said \"I know you're happier without me\" because he wanted me to plead and convince him of all the reasons I am not happier without him... and I did like a sucker. I asked if any of it was real and he said yes, he really did love me like he said. I said if you love someone and want to marry them you don't just leave when things get hard. Then he threw more breadcrumbs saying maybe if I can get my life together we can try again. My life was just fine before he came into it :-(.\n\nSo I guess my questions are: How did I not see this? How can someone claim you are the love of their life and just delete you out of it like you were nothing? Will he be like this in every relationship he has or will he change? How do I heal when I feel so low?  Because he seems to be a covert narcissist is the abuse less real? Am I making up that he is a narcissist to try to pass off the guilt for not being good enough? How come he is not hoovering me this time? Someone please explain this to me.\n\n**TLDR:** Guy said I was the love of his life and we were talking marriage, then he boots me out of his life.

The comedy show had 2 opening acts and it ran much later than we anticipated. I begged him to not pick her up. Disturbing a child at 12:30am is ridiculous. It was my preference and I just wanted him to please respect what I needed in that moment. I wanted to just go straight home and get a good nights sleep and get a few things done in the morning before starting the day. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHe went crazy arguing with me, that I was being selfish and that I didn't want to spend time with her, that I had no sympathy that his mother never does anything with her so its our responsibility (yet I wasn't good enough to be a parent???), that getting her at midnight wasn't a big deal. Luckily, since we has cheap with his car about miles and gas and since he would read his finance credential studies in the car all the time (the same credentials that were always some gateway in the future to a better life, yet every time he got one, he always had to start working on another one for a myriad of reasons and if I wasn't understanding I was an unsupportive bad girlfriend that wasn't marriage material) I was the one driving that evening, so I just drove home and I refused to go get her. He left the house after we got home to get her, at 1 in the morning. I told him do not wake me up when they get in. He had his little sister come into the room to kiss me goodnight when they got in, so \"he\" didn't wake me up, and what kind of a monster am I for not wanting that? It was all about him putting me in my place and letting me know what I wanted or needed meant absolutely nothing. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThat morning I informed him that I would not come to the air show. He got upset not because I wasn't going to have fun with them or because I was upset about what he did the night before, but because he needed me to drive so he could study for financial credentials on the way. In hindsight, I see that this example is among many that he worked so hard at convincing me I needed him it was right there in front of me that he needed me more. He screamed, he called me a bad person, he pointed out to his sister how bad I was, he punched a wall. Then he tried bartering. He tried to sweeten the deal for me, but I don't remember how. I was not going. Period. Guess what? They didn't go. By the end of the day they ended up chasing me down where I was spending time with my Mom. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhy didn't I tell him we were done? That he was a manipulative user and I no longer had fun when I spent time with him? I am angry at myself. However, I didn't cave in that day, so I'll try to remember that when being gentle on myself.", "subreddit": "NarcissisticAbuse"}

Last week, my nex reached out to me again using another phone number. He said he felt bad and wanted to talk because a lot had happened. At first, I was just going to ignore him. But curiosity got the best of me, and I decided to call him back.\n\nIt was him hoovering me, and I realize that. But we actually had some really deep conversations that seemed genuine. Don't get me wrong, I know there wasn't total honesty in his conversation but it was more honest than he has ever been with me, probably anybody for that matter. In a very weird, backwards way, talking to him really helped me. It gave me some clarity and closure with our relationship. \n\nI thought I would share some of the things we talked about because it was words from him, the mind of a narcissist. He didn't straight up admit he was a narcissist, but he told me one of other exes called him a narcissist but defended himself by saying all women say their exes are narcissist. Funny, he later told me he was taking a quiz to see if he was but didn't get the results because it forced him to enter his email address. Guess he didn't want to know bad enough.\n\nOne of the things he admitted to me was how vain and shallow he was. He talked about how he is so insecure and is very conscience. He mentioned how he stems from his childhood and being bullied and made fun of. He basically said he does need someone to make him look good versus feel good. He is looking for a trophy wife to show off because to him it makes him look better by having some type of arm candy more or less. \n\nHe also admitted he basically has a sex addiction. He mentioned he is making up for lost time because he felt he used to be bad at sex and now he feels more practiced and wants to sleep with as many women as possible. He thinks about sex all the time and masturbates all the time. I told him if he really needs to sleep with multiple women then find someone who wants to be in an open relationship. He said he couldn't because that means whoever he is with would sleep with other men, and he couldn't have that. It is an ego thing. He wants to have his cake and eat it too.\n\nHe basically told me I was his best friend because I am the only person he can be that open with. That I make him feel better than anybody ever has. There is probably some BS to that but I think there is some truth as well. I told him that most people want their partner to also be their best friend and if you had that, why would you let it go? He said he doesn't even understand himself and he is just messed up. He told me he wonders why nobody has swiped me up yet. He told me he didn't really deserve me either which is 100% the truth. I am too good for him meaning, I am too caring and kind to put up with his BS. I asked him how he would feel when I started dating again since he was talking to me about dating, and he said he would realized he effed up. I don't understand why you kinda see what you have in front of you but you still don't try. But i do realize, it's just who he is and has absolutely nothing do with who I am. \n\nHe basically reached out because he was having issues with his new supply, and he was looking to me to talk to and make him feel better. This was a girl he said who was perfect, yet he was using me to get back at her. I spent so much time wondering if he was going to change for the next person, and he obviously hasn't. He even asked me what he should do about her. I told him he was asking the wrong person but did tell him if he feels like he has to act that way, then he shouldn't be dating the person because when you care about someone and like them you don't play those sorts of games at our age. Yet, he was still hurting her. I know he went back to her after he talked to me. A small part of me wants to reach out to her and warn her but she wouldn't believe me anyway. He is good at manipulating people and making himself look good. He would deny it even though I have proof. I also believe in karma, and he will mess it up eventually anyway. I just feel so bad for her because she is just as naive as I was. \n\nHe said so much and expressed a lot to me. Like I said, it gave me a lot of clarity and some insight into the way his mind is programmed. It really will allow me to stop blaming myself. It helps to know that it was never me, and it is him. I am enough. I deserve so much better than the way he treated me and the way he would treat anybody. \n\nTalking with him helped me a lot and I am going to go into 2020 with a better mindset. I am going to move forward with my life and leave him and all the hurt he caused me in 2019. I still will never fully understand any of it. But he is damaged and needs professional help, and I can't help him change or want to be better. Because I do love him, I do hope he gets help one day. As much of an a-hole he was, I believe we all should have happiness one day.", "subreddit": "NarcissisticAbuse"}

With your help and the help of my family I have set up a plan to get to a better place.\n\nWhile things have improved a bit, a dent formed in my plan yesterday when I was in a car accident which totaled my car; my only means of independence.\n\nYou would expect a significant other to be concerned for their spouse, to want to help and do whatever they could to cheer the other up.  I did for him when he was in a car accident earlier this year.  But not him.\n\nAll his questions were about insurance and constant reminders that we were paying for everything because it was my fault.  He had to stop on the way home from work and bought himself snacks and treats, nothing for me.  He then waited, staring at me, for me to load up a game he likes so we could play together and then complained I wasn\u2019t doing my part.  He then accepted an invite to a New Years Eve party hosted by his best friend after asking only if we had plans for that night.  Finally, as he went to bed, he told me to continue to play the game because I was too far behind him and needed to gather resources to get up to his level.\n\nThe only comfort I got from him was after he had put his work gear away, changed clothes and had his snack.  At which point he said \u201cI guess you want a hug or something.\u201d  At which point he hugged me but stopped when the cat meowed at him for food, at which point he hugged the cat so hard the cat cried out in pain.\n\nI am very upset that I will lose my car and be stuck here.  My parents want me to up my plan and move back in with them some states away, but I will lose my job and my financial independence if I do.  I am feeling lost again and need suggestions.  What can I do?\n\nUPDATE:   In a strange twist, my mother asked my husband to buy me flowers to cheer me up.\n\nThat was it.  She did not yell at him or accuse him of abuse or call him a bad husband.  All she said was \u201cOP is having a bad week.  Why not buy her some flowers to cheer her up.\u201d\n\nWell, this got husband so upset he shit himself while at work and spent the rest of the day running to the bathroom to throw up (or so he told me).\n\nUpon arriving home he started yelling.  He said I was being abusive by not talking to him, that I was a horrible wife, that he is broke and can\u2019t be expected to do things for me and that he is no longer going to worry about me.  He is giving up on me and no longer gives a fuck what I do.  He then ran to the bathroom and threw up every where.  He said my mother had stressed him out and it was all my fault.\n\nThe.

He, of course, did his narc thing and he is no longer talking to me for something common and normal he considers a \"deal-breaker\". I'm not even sure what I did and I'm not that concerned; knowing as I do he'd eventually come around to finding a reason to be done with me. \n\nAnyway, it got me thinking about what was the most insidious, most subtle but dangerous, degrading thing he did to me and I think it was the \"double-standard\". \n\nI couldn't make mistakes. I couldn't be perfect without him finding mistakes. I would be held to the highest (and always moving) standard while he was never beholden to any.\n\nRandom examples: \n\n* He'd rant and rave and insult me and break things and get violent.

I mean, it had to be true when someone, who claimed he loved me, regarded me that way.\n\nI didn't realize how much that double-standard (of course the insults, judgments, looks of disappointment, that went with it) disconnected me from reality. I doubted my logic. I doubted my quality. I doubted my ability to function in society. It hit deeper than I knew. I shrugged my shoulders and didn't make eye contact. I stopped reaching for goals because I believed I'd never reach them anyway. I felt, and still feel, hollow from it. I'm still shaky. \n\nAfter devaluing me, degrading me, making me doubt every single thing about myself, in ways I didn't even know were vulnerable, to the point of being rendered helpless, I was discarded for \"being a burden.\"\n\nI never really realized how much of my self-esteem was robbed until I was out.

I'm guessing he leveled without me to our goal of level 30 \n\n\nI moved in with him last October cross country and have no job yet though I've been trying to get one \nJust last month he left his job over a blow up and blames my younger brother and I for him leaving it cause we made him mad\n\n\nI love him more than anything and he takes care of me and my family but his anger issues have been getting to me lately and I dont know what to do about it..", "subreddit": "abuse"}

I felt responsible in my silence. \n\nYesterday I saw a new boyfriend become Facebook official. This time, I was done being silent. I gathered up screenshots of all my convos with my abuser's exes before and after me, and paid $7 to print off the court records detailing his long history of criminal behavior, drug abuse, domestic violence, and filing false police reports (3 convictions for that alone!). I took everything I had gathered and sent an honest message of warning to the new boyfriend. \n\nHe listened! He thanked me for all the information, ranted a bit at the difficult of finding a good guy, and seemed like he's gonna move on! I don't want to be dramatic but I might have even saved his life.

I thought to myself, \"Finally, there was somebody I could be myself with. Maybe there was a future with him?\"\n\nThen, as we were only official for a week or two, he became attached very quickly, saying things like \"I love you\" and \"You're the source of my happiness\" on our first few dates, as well as full body hugging PDA.\n\nI told him that he needed to slow down. When I told him this, he became defensive and blamed me for being too close minded, instead of just asking me why I felt that way.\n\nI felt that we needed to slow down, mostly because our relationship was too new for own good. My heart wasn't invested, but it earnestly wanted to be.\n\nHe kept pushing the envelope over and over until I got really tired of it. I communicated all these issues as clearly as I could, though sometimes out of frustration. Each time I brought up these issues, I was always the one to blame.\n\nI wanted our relationship to work out, but I gave up hope when I realized that he was not going to respect my wishes to take things slow. I told him the things he said made me uncomfortable because our relationship was still new and I was just wading the waters.\n\nThough he seemed to be completely invested in me, he constantly devalued me, saying things like \"I'm the only one who will be willing to deal with you. Every body else who looks at you is going to look at your problems and say, \"Bye!\"\n\nEventually, I dumped him over the phone because I knew he would not take no for an answer in person. We had agreed to talk about things over breakfast the following morning, but he did not respect my wishes at all and demanded that we speak face to face to \"Prove that I'm a macho man\" over breaking up with him.\n\nHe parked in front of my house, flooding my phone with calls and texts, begging me to talk to him, while at the same time calling me a coward, a selfish asshole, and a horrible person. I had never called him any names, and he called me names liberally every time we had an argument.\n\nFinally, he threatened suicide, and I called his friend to help me guide him through his suffering. I did not want to speak with him, I did not want anything to do with him because I just had this very buggy, creepy, and scary feeling about him. I feel guilty for completely ignoring him, but I had stated my intentions clearly and that I would not be replying to his texts and that our relationship was over prior to him parking in front of my house.\n\nNow, 2 months after our relationship ended, I still struggle with feelings of guilt. I am constantly being hoovered to speak with him. And trust me, if I knew he was a good person, I would talk to him. But so far, all I see is him blaming me and harassing me for everything that went wrong in the relationship while he takes no responsibility. He tells me he's never done anything wrong. He's made seven fake profiles to message me and counting...\n\nAt times I feel like I am the narcissist. Since breaking up with him, I've crawled back into my little shell, afraid to give my heart to anyone but my family. I didn't even say Merry Christmas to my best friends because I fear connection. I fear that I'm the one who is the narcissist and that everybody thinks I suck the air out of the room.\n\nAfter 2 months of being with a narcissist, I feel like I've changed completely as a person. I feel proud of myself for mustering up the courage to finally dump him. He sucked the life out of me and I blamed myself for that feeling every day, but it turns out that it may just have been him.\n\nEdit: Sorry, this post is kind of a mess, but I was able to get my thought out of \"paper\"", "subreddit": "NarcissisticAbuse"}

I was about 6 years old I think. I had just gotten a baby cousin. My mom had a boyfriend at the time who she is no longer with. Either way, something weird happened.

Then though, sometime later, her boyfriend ended up grabbing me at the top of the steps in the apartment I was living in at the time and he had one of the diapers. I was trying to fight him and everything but he eventually got the diaper on me. I immediately ripped it off and it was weird. I almost feel like the diapers were kept in the closet for some time after. By the way, that is the last time I can remember wearing a diaper. I just don\u2019t know how I still remember this experience so vividly this many years later. I\u2019m 18 now. I rarely wet the bed as a child.
