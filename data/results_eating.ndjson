On the third I was diagnosed with type 1 diabetes and put on insulin. Almost immediately all the cravings returned. I was put on a keto/low carb diet. I love pasta, bread, sweets. Now that I can't have those I try to distract my cravings by eating meat, eggs, cheese, other carbless foods but I still feel so empty. And I feel even more disgusting now than before. I eat so much that I get bad stomach pain or vomit, then I eat more, and its all greasy oily foods now. My face is breaking out, I am uncomfortable eating all these heavy foods, and I don't even enjoy them. I feel gross. I was even vegetarian before this for the plain reason that I don't enjoy meats. My body isn't used to these foods, it would feel disgusting if I ate one burger before, now there is a never ending stream of meat and cheese entering my body and even though I hate it I'm afraid to stop because if I do I'm going to resort back to sugary snacks and carbs and it could literally kill me.

I discovered a love for the sport, and since I wanted to improve as quickly as possible, I started losing weight. I went from 168 lbs to 144 lbs by eating 700-1000 calories under maintenance every day. I went from climbing my first V2 to climbing my first V6. I got a six-pack and everything.\n\nUnfortunately, I've gained back half the weight I've lost in the past month. I've got a bit of a belly now and I can't quite keep up with my climbing friends anymore. I've been eating 5000-6000 calories every day. Here's what a typical day looks like for me now:\n\nBreakfast:\n\n* something healthy like a bowl of oatmeal or greek yogurt\n\nLunch:\n\n* something small like a single sandwich\n\nDinner:\n\n* box of candy\n\n* box of sugary cereal (usually granola)\n\n* box of baked goods (e.g. donuts, muffins, cookies, apple fritters)\n\n* \"real food\" (e.g. 14\" sub, frozen chicken wings)\n\n* 1.5 quarts of ice cream\n\nAnd tbh, I'm holding back. If I really gave no fucks, my dinners would include packaged cookies and a family size bag of chips. I \"limit\" my nightly binge. I'll get the 1200 calorie 4-pack of apple fritters instead of the 1600 calorie cheese danish. I'll skip the chips, because 1700 calories for something that's just crunchy and salty doesn't seem quite worth it.\n\nI want to lose the weight I've regained and get back to where I was, but I can't stop binging every night. I walk into the grocery store every night shaking my head and hating myself before I even buy anything. I don't know what's changed. For the past several months, I guess I've felt like my life has been missing something. Binging was my primary source of joy and pleasure and I took it away. It was supposed to be worth it in the end, but as I achieved my rock climbing and aesthetic goals, my overall happiness didn't change that much. I want the joy and pleasure of binging back in my life. I was wrong to give it up, or at least that's what part of me thinks.\n\nHonestly food brings me so much pleasure and joy that sometimes I think it would be better to give up everything and become obese and die early if it means being able to eat whatever I want whenever I want.

Trigger warning.", "author": "Slythelephanic", "self_text": "This may be long and dumb so don't read if you're not prepared for long and dumb.\n\nI've struggled with eating disorders since I was about 12 and I thought I'd share my journey as I am new here. It started off just skipping a meal or two, maybe not eating for a day. Then it escalated into obsessively counting calories and not eating for three days. I remember looking up how many calories were in an apple and then deciding not to eat it. Then I would overeat and cry and purge. By the time I was 17 I was waking up at 5am to exercise. I would stay outside running until I almost passed out every day. I would get dizzy and start seeing spots and that was how I knew I was ready to stop. I would go inside and eat one granola bar and drink some water. I would eat nothing for the rest of the day. Sometimes I would treat myself to a banana dipped in peanut butter.\n\nAt 18, for multiple reasons other than my ED I attempted suicide. It was my third attempt but the most impactful. I had never had a problem with vomiting before but after being in the hospital throwing up white foam and half-digested pills it stopped me from wanting to force myself to purge again. Whenever I tried I just couldn't bring myself to do it.\n\nI haven't purged since I was 18 (I'm 21 now) but I destroyed my stomach. When I was 19 I was unable to eat without excruciating pain. Even drinking water gave me heartburn that hurt all the way through my back and left me sobbing. Even though I had stopped purging for a year it caught up to me. I had eroded away my stomach and esophagus almost to the point of ulcers. My body just started rejecting food because that's what I taught it to do. The aftermath of what I did to my body was worse than the actual disorder. I went through so much pain trying to fix what I had broken. I still can't eat some of my favorite foods because my stomach simply doesn't tolerate it anymore.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBad things out of the way, I am so much better now. I still have lots of stomach problems but I'm learning how to eat healthy and to not hate my body. (I still can't say I love my body but I hope to get there one day). I've upgraded from \\*hating\\* my body to being \\*indifferent\\* to my fat. I don't look in the mirror and see fat and ugly. I look in the mirror and see my body for the machine that it is. For the most part my body does what it's supposed to. All my organs are functioning and take care of me even when I don't take care of myself and that's pretty cool. That's the best way I cope with it. I've learned to put the proper amount of food on my plate so as to not under or overeat. Sometimes I still skip meals or pay too close attention to the number of calories. Sometimes I eat way too much and I cry over it. But I've learned to accept that that's not who I am. I know that I can eat a piece of pie and I don't have to feel bad for it. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThat's why I'm writing this. I ate a huge piece of pie today. Way more than I should have. I kept eating even after my stomach started hurting because it was really good. I immediately felt guilty and wanted to go throw it up. I considered it for the first time in a very long time. But then I realized I haven't had pie in months. And it was a good pie. \"Normal\" people overeat sometimes too. They just don't worry about it as much. I had pie today and that's not something I need to feel bad about. It was a good pie and I'm glad I ate it. That probably sounds dumb but I almost cried when I realized I was allowed to eat pie. There was a time when I couldn't eat pie and now I can. I'm still struggling but I should be proud.", "subreddit": "fuckeatingdisorders"}

I shared a small bottle with my fiancee as we waited. I wasn't worried about the cola as this isn't one of my normal triggers and I can comfortably limit myself when it comes to coke. \n\nIt didn't make me purge back in to sugar or over indulge but I did notice a couple of things.\n\nFirst of all, I could notice my spike in energy after just a few sips. I noticed I had an instant rush of energy and my mind and body was moving faster than before. Normally when I would overeat on sugars, I couldn't notice much of a kick and if anything it made me more tired.\n\nSecondly, I noticed after I had had the cola, my cravings for sugar were intensified. Not to the point they were at the start of the challenge but definitely stronger than I've had the last few days. I knew I could beat them and they would soon go away and sure enough in an hour or so my want for sugar had disappeared.\n\nThese next few days are going to be tough at home. Especially not being able to exercise yet alone walk around without crutches. I'm sure I'm going to crave a sweet food or two as a piece of comfort.

I don't want to waste an appointment and I also kind of don't want to recover but also I'm so sick of my life right now. \n\nContext:  \n\\- I'm overweight. My BMI has dropped 8 points in just less than a year but I'm still in the obese category.   \n\\- I have always mostly struggled with BED but have been in and out of restriction phases since November. When not strictly restricting I have still lost weight as I've compensated for binges, which I never used to do. I had an appointment with my GP when I started to restrict and was honest about what was happening. I had several more appointments (really about a different issue, but she always weighed me and we talked a little about food issues). The last one was in about April. At first I lost weight very fast and then it slowed down when more binging crept in.   \n\\- The only help she offered was CBT. I am 40 weeks into the waiting list which is currently about 60 weeks.   \n\\- I got a few counselling sessions from a charity but my counsellor went on long term sick leave so they're on hold indefinitely.   \n\\- I have private healthcare through work but they won't see me because I got a few appointments with a psychologist for BED/anxiety about 6 years ago.   \n\\- I can access the EAP (Employee Assistance Programme) through work but they won't give me face to face counselling because I'm on the waiting list with the NHS, and I hate their phone counselling because you just phone whenever you feel like it so it's always a different person.   \n\\- I'm not losing weight super quickly right now and I just feel like my GP doesn't take me that seriously at all. \n\nAny advice?! I feel bad taking up a GP's time and I honestly feel judged whenever I go. I felt like I really exposed myself in being honest about this from the beginning but didn't get much support. I know I could see another GP, but the one I go to is really kind and I think she's perhaps frustrated that she can't offer me anything else. \n\nWriting this out has made me realise that the psychologist appointments a few years ago might be on my medical records as being for anxiety, which would perhaps help me get support through private healthcare. Perhaps it's worth me going just to ask about that.

It's only been recently (around two weeks, where I have seen a marked improvement in my mentality and behaviors). Unfortunately due to scheduling conflicts my therapist is no longer available and I am hesitant about starting all over with a new one. I did not think I urgently needed more professional support as I had gradually sought her support less and less as I improved. \n\nHowever after reconnecting with an old friend who I believe has severe body image issues herself, I ended up binging again after 2 weeks of no relapses. During our interactions I made sure to be very aware of my thoughts and even felt more strongly about practicing what I have learnt in the past year. I even ate what I wanted while she watched and ate nothing (something that would've been out of the question before). I still had body discomfort that was more pronounced as I still have the tendency to compare my physique (which has grown bigger during recovery) to those who were similar or larger than me a few years ago.  I briefly shared my current mentality on food with her, although I did not want to be overbearing about my views on food, so I think she has an inkling of my issues.

The only thing that boosts my self esteem and allows me to express myself is fashion and wearing cute outfits but those don\u2019t look good on my big body!! I even bought a bunch of cute clothes over the summer that would only fit once I reach my goal weight to motivate me and because I was sure id reach it by now but again I was wrong after thousands of these attempts.

Up until probably late December, I was eating pretty healthily and had lost around 50lbs. After the loss of my father I began to binge and restrict, which caused my weight loss to slow. I probably lost another 20lbs in around 7 months, which put me at about 190 in July.\n\n     Since mid July I\u2019ve been back on track and haven\u2019t binged at all. I have two set times a day I eat (12pm and 5pm) and eat around 1000 calories a day (I feel guilty eating this much, but because I live with my parents it\u2019s hard to restrict), and drink probably drink anywhere from 1-2 liters of water a day. I\u2019ve been losing weight rather quickly and dropped down to 172.7 last Monday. \n\n     Here\u2019s the problem: since last Monday I\u2019ve done nothing but GAIN WEIGHT. I have had no diet changes whatsoever, and I have gained 3lbs and the number just keeps going up (also 3lbs sounds like such a small number but I\u2019m super obsessed about my weight and any sort of gain makes me anxious and depressed:\u2019). I really don\u2019t know what\u2019s happening. Yesterday I lost .4 lbs and then today I wake up and have gained .8lbs (I was out all day yesterday and probably only got in like 16oz of water).

For me, school and research are comforting and probably the only thing preventing my ED from spiraling out of control. There, the only thing that matters is what's inside my head, not what my body looks like. It doesn't matter how much I ate that day or if I gained 5 lbs. It's still hard to do anything after a binge or if I notice that I'm gaining weight, but studying or working is not as bad as going out and seeing people when I feel fat. On the flip side, when I'm going through a restrictive phase, knowing I have school or work gives me a reason to eat, even if it isn't a lot. Engineering for me is an escape from how I feel about my body.\n\nOr at least it can be when no one is making anything about my appearance.\n\nA guy on LinkedIn hit on me recently. Instead of messaging me on the site, he decided to be extra creepy and email me. He told me that I caught his eye because I was so pretty, and that even though LinkedIn isn't a dating site or a social networking site, he would like to reach out. I blocked and reported him on LinkedIn. I didn't think to block his email, but ended up doing it a few days later because he emailed me again.\n\nSomeone I work with in research told me that we should put a poster of me in a swimsuit up as a recruiting tactic, because seeing a girl will help bring in all the engineering boys, especially if my boobs are out.\n\nAnd then there's the little things too.  Being the only girl in my research group, because EECS has so few women. Guys staring in class because I showed up late and couldn't sit with my friends and had to sit alone. Guys talking over me, because I'm a girl, so why would I know what I'm talking about?\n\nAll of this is so triggering. I'm already constantly tormented by my appearance, and this is making everything so much worse. I feel like I need to be thinner because of how much I stand out. I don't want to be the fat engineering girl, I need to be the thin engineer. The skinny girl. The pretty girl. Because I'm the only girl.

Me, on the other hand has always been very muscular. I'm not super toned, but I have huge muscles for whatever reason.

I'm not overweight, but I still have to suck in my stomach and cheeks because I feel like everyone looks better.\n\nANYWAYSSS, here's the story.\n\nWhen I was 7, this one girl in my class (whom was also my best friend) just so happened to be 2 inches taller than me but the same weight. She was thin- and being thin was something everyone noted as this amazing beautiful thing. So right then and there, I was going to be thin (keep in mind, we were both fairly tall me being 4'5 and 50 pounds). Fast forward to spring break. We had gone out to eat, and I sucked down the food but by the second we got home I vomited it back up. My grandmother tried to give me a sandwich, but yet again the second it touched my mouth, I threw up. I being a chocaholic, could not even stomach a tiny piece of a Hershey's, and then we new something was up. This went on for 5 or so days. I had a distorted body image, my mom said my ribs were extremely visible and that I had no body fat whatsoever, but while looking in the mirror, I saw almost what looked like an elephant. My grandpa didn't know what to do, so he went to the store and bought cheese. Mozzarella cheese. After what was almost 2 weeks eating virtually nothing and only drinking water, my hair started falling out and I also started eating cheese. I was 29 pounds. I continuously ate this 2 pound bag of cheese, and within a month I had gained 30 pounds. So please everyone, if you are struggling with a low weight, you can get through it :)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n(Quick edit, I still really do have it, and go for long periods without eating, but I've curbed the vomiting and I wholeheartedly love icecream now :)", "subreddit": "fuckeatingdisorders"}

I haven't weighed myself in a bit, trying not to, but I can tell I've gained weight. When I first started recovering I was so scared of anything sugary. Literally anything, even fruit I avoided. I literally thought I was being healthy, that because I wasn't over-exercising anymore I didn't have an eating disorder. It didn't hit me that I was still starving myself until my friend confronted me about my eating disorder. Anyways, food freaks me out. I eat better, I eat things I want regardless of the sugar, but it gives me mad anxiety. I think about what I ate after I ate it too much, I worry beforehand and have to convince myself that eating some ice cream ONCE won't make me fat, and ugh. It's exhausting. I'm sick of it. Just tonight I fell back into my old habits, I got really stressed and started working out. And that would be healthy if I didn't have an eating disorder, which sucks. I cant even have a healthy coping mechanism because now the most common way to reduce stress is a slippery slope back into not eating for a few days. \n\nI saw a picture of myself from a few days ago, and it was the first time I noticed how skinny I've gotten. I don't look skinny, not in the mirror. My boobs are kinda big, so they make me look fat (not to brag, I hate them, take them if you want). It spooked me, because I look kinda gross. But I also looked good? I guess it was nice to feel valid like that, knowing in my soul I was skinny. I'm not anymore, I gained since that photo. But it was good, I ate more after seeing it and had some ice cream. But now I'm fat after eating a bunch today. I wanted to delete what I just typed, because it's absurd. I look at myself, and I'm fatter. But just yesterday, I wasn't. So either my dysmorphia is worse than I thought, or its water weight. Probably both. \n\nAnyways I'm outtie. TL;DR, recovery sucks and it's worth it, but keep in mind it's harder to eat than you think. Once you give yourself these ideas and habits about eating, that's how it is.

I just don't want to bug my friend!)", "author": "royzin", "self_text": " My best friend/roommate is in recovery, and because I'm a writer, she's encouraged me to write a fiction piece approaching eating disorder narratives differently. (She and I have talked a lot about how most available fiction narratives contribute to stigma or reinforce myths). She's worked with me a lot on this, but I still have some perfunctory questions I need to clarify that I can't easily find answers to online. While I know a lot from her of what it feels like to be in treatment and what sorts of things happen, I want to thoroughly understand logistics. Right now, she spends so much time in treatment I don't want to waste her limited leisure time taking notes on the minutiae of treatment -- that time is better spent watching Doctor Who together or talking about which sort of moth we would each be if we were both moths.\n\nThis is a fiction piece, and not intended to be educational or didactic. But fiction explores ideas, allows people to empathize with experiences they have never had, or identify with characters whose experiences they do relate to. My goal is to write something that 1) helps people who don't have EDs understand what treatment and recovery is actually like, 2) makes people who've experienced it think, \"That's so accurate! Exactly!\" It would be impossible to tell a good, interesting, well-written story if I wasn't achieving the above.\n\nI know that this might be triggering or just exhausting for some people, so people absolutely have the right to not answer. But if anyone is interested in demystifying and generous enough to share, I would be so, so appreciative!!! I'm definitely sourcing my research from a lot of different places, but I think it would be a huge mistake not to ask a variety of people who can speak anonymously online.\n\nHere are some things I want to make sure I get right:\n\n**What staff members are there in Residential? What are their duties? How often are they each around/how often do clients interact with them?**  \nI've visited my friend and gotten to know staff during groups, and of course I know a lot from what she tells me, but I still want to make sure I thoroughly know what the treatment team looks like. Online websites usually only list people like the therapists, if anyone at all, but I know there's a much broader treatment team and I want to make sure I have a handle on what they do and their interactions with clients.\n\n**What does a \"typical\" Residential schedule look like? (Daily, weekly, monthly?)**  \nI know this can vary wildly from treatment center to treatment center, but there do seem to be some consistencies (groups, one-on-one therapy, outings, medical stuff, etc).\n\n**How is conversation at meals/snacks conducted? What are some examples of conversations?**  \nI know the typical table rules, and I know that -- at least at dinners -- there are sometimes games (we play a kind of 20 Questions my friend learned at treatment at home), or a question people take turns answering (my friend famously proposes obscure ones that go over really well -- like \"what kind of fabric would you be?\"). Is this just at dinner, or at all meal/snack times? What are some examples you've seen or heard of?\n\n**Medical stuff -- totally understand if people feel uncomfortable with this one.**  \nI don't actually have any questions about weighing, but definitely feel free to offer in case I'm missing things. But I know you have to get labs done before going to treatment, and then they continue to happen while in treatment. Who conducts these labs? Is it the same person or different nurses/specialists? Are they these providers there all the time or is there a dedicated medical day? What sorts of tests are conducted (I think vitamin/mineral blood tests, general urine tox tests, heart rate, etc). I know what all this looks like in a hospital environment, but what about residential? Is it onsite or offsite?\n\n**Insurance -- the most frustrating.**  \nWho's in charge of all the insurance/billing/blahblahblah? Do they do double duty in other roles, or are there dedicated administrators for that? How often do clients interact with them?\n\n**If you got this far even just reading, thank you!**  \nI genuinely have so much respect and admiration for people battling EDs. For general health stuff, we think of \"recovery\" as \"taking it easy\" -- but with EDs, it's *going to battle*. Recovery is courageous.\n\nIf I were a moth, I would be a peppered moth.  \nIf I were a fabric, I would be dark blue velvet.  \nWhat about you?", "subreddit": "eating_disorders"}

The years of abuse left me with a complex about myself for many years. I started drinking and smoking at an early age to not think about it anymore and I was out of control eating by the time I went to college. \n\nI had ballooned up to 250+ lbs and was miserable. I started yo-yo dieting and usually stayed between 200-230. I would always fall of the wagon and give up. One day I had had enough and decided to change. I bought an elliptical and I got a handle on the eating, quit smoking and finally quit drinking. I had lost 70 lbs and was in the best shape of my life.\n\nBut the negatives from my past came creeping back into my head. Everyone around me was not supportive, but rather negative about the new me. Their negativity began to affect me, it wasn't good enough. It's NEVER good enough... I started to doubt myself and doubt that I could maintain this for a long time. I started smoking weed to help calm my nerves and deal with the stressful situations in my life.\n\nThis backfired as it unleashed all my cravings for things and I bottled everything up into a sugar-laden binge of food. I quit smoking weed as it had contributed to my re-gain of the 70lb that I lost. I was depressed, fat again and sober. Three very hard things to deal with at the same time. My marriage was going down the toilet and I was afraid that my children would follow in my footsteps and get fat too. \n\nI let myself get back into the negativeness of my past and kept substituting addictions. I went from drinking and smoking to food and weed. I realized during this process that it is not the food that is the problem. Food addiction is just that, an addiction. It is a coping mechanism that we have developed to deal with our problems.\n\nIn order for us to lose weight, we first have to deal with our issues, the REAL reason why we use food as a drug. Once you find out the truth about yourself and what the problem is/was, you can then heal and put down the drug. Food is fuel, but food is also a drug. The difference is what you kind of food are you eating. The sugary, fatty, salty processed garbage sold to us en masse is the drug. Fruits, vegetables, lean meats and nuts/seeds/Grains are the real foods. Focus on the good stuff and leave the processed foods to the junkies. \n\nI'm losing weight again, this time slowly and not by trying. I just stopped eating so damn much. My portions used to be 1.5 times the size they are now. I go by the fist rule. If it is is bigger than both my fists, it's too much on my plate. Stay away from the junk, I cook everything I eat. If it is comes to in a box, bag or has instructions, I won't eat it. I found recipes that I like that are simple to make. It takes like 30 minutes most nights to cook dinner and about 2 hours of food prep on Sunday to make my lunches for the week. Or you can make an additional portion of dinner and eat it for lunch the next day. \n\nEither way, it takes about as much time as sitting in your car waiting on a fast food meal does. At least the home cooked meal won't kill you or be 1,350 calories in a bag...\n\nDrink more water! You would be surprised to find out that many people who are overweight are dehydrated. I was surprised by this. A friend of mine who is a medical doctor explained that being dehydrated can cause a whole host of illnesses in people that we don't connect to water. Gallstones, kidney stones and utis can come from being chronically dehydrated. Stones form from lack of Bile can occur from poor diet and not drinking enough water. UTIs can come from a buildup of yeast which will accumulate because there's not enough water to flush it out. Ibs was another one and heartburn. It's crazy to think that just by drinking more water and less liquid sugar, you can heal the body. So, drink up. Water is good for you.", "subreddit": "FoodAddiction"}

I\u2019m aware it\u2019s long, so sorry about that. \n\nTW: numbers \n\nIt was for insomnia and concerns about the possibility of sleep apnea. It took me a million years to be willing to go in to get sleep apnea checked because of my judgments about it (feeling that it was something fat people have, and if I get diagnosed then I will be \u201cofficially\u201d fat). I\u2019ve been out of intensive treatment for about 4 years, and I still see a therapist I originally met through treatment. I have gained about 100 lbs since then\u2014 due to a combination of a lot of factors (no more restricting, serious joint issues and chronic pain that make exercise really hard, new mental health medication that\u2019s been weight-gaining, I could go on). Body image is still a HUGE challenge, and this is wildly exacerbated by the weight gain. I\u2019m not gaining any weight any more\u2014 it\u2019s leveled off, and I\u2019m currently around the size of the rest of my relatives on my dad\u2019s side, and I seem to have many of the generally appearance-related gene expressions from this side of the family. \n\nAnyway, I go in, and advocate to do a blind weight and not be told the numbers. I express to the nurse that I\u2019m extremely anxious about the appointment. We go in to the room, and it\u2019s PLASTERED with posters about portion control, BMI, examples of exercises to lose weight, and advertisements for the clinic that say \u201cObesity is a disease\u2014 we treat it like one.\u201d \n\nI have to wait here for about 15 minutes until the doctor comes in. He listens to my symptoms and I add that many family members, of all weights and sizes, have been diagnosed with sleep apnea. I say right off the bat that I\u2019m in recovery from an eating disorder, and I\u2019m not going to be able to engage in any type of conversation about weight. \n\nHe then gives me a pamphlet about sleep apnea that has an entire page dedicated to the importance of weight loss in treating sleep apnea. He pulls out a tape measure and leaves it on the table. I immediately ask him what this is for. He says he needs to measure my neck. I allow him to do this, even though I was choking back tears about how triggering it was to have my body size measured by a stranger, after already freaking out about being trapped in this room with all these posters. \n\nAnyway, I leave this appointment and cry in the lobby, and call my parents. \n\nI do the sleep test, and the people there are lovely and put me at ease. \n\nNow I have to go back to this doctors office to follow up on the results, and of course I\u2019m dreading it. I just checked my online info, and I see this doctor has added my BMI to the \u201cproblem list\u201d of things I\u2019m being treated for, and also added a diagnosis of morbid obesity. \n\nCool.

I've been doing really well with recovering now for the last 1.5 months-ish. Things are going really well-mostly. The last few weeks I have been struggling with AWFUL acid reflux. To the point where I can't eat anything for like 6-8 hour periods of the time, I also struggle with TMJ and I am in finals- the extra tension is causing my jaw to hurt like hell so I solid foods are REALLY painful to chew up. I have not been doing this on purpose this time, I have still been eating without restriction or purging, whatever I want and in normal reasonable portions (without calorie counting!!! YAY)- except when it hurts too much to chew, or when my acid reflux is bad I don't want to eat anything. So I really don't think I have relapsed as of yet- but tonight I saw myself in the mirror and realized I look thinner than the last time I looked (I avoid looking in the mirror as part of recovering), I felt drunk. I haven't had a drop of alcohol in months but you'd never of known. I was elated and so insanely happy, and still, am, but now I am scared too. I do not want to relapse, but I also want to? I worked too hard to let it all go, but I also don't care?   \n\n\nI have a 75 % final exam tomorrow- the last one of this damn degree- Maybe that's a part of why I am freaking out so much right now. I have ADHD and dyslexia, for me, recovery has been motivated by me being absolutely incapable of concentrating on schoolwork due to the fact that I was fucking my body up. Recovery was motivated by needing to finish my degree and wanting to be able to pursue my dreams (which it turns out, my ED has robbed me of that regardless. jokez on me rite?). I am afraid that after my exam is over I won't have that motivation any more. I won't have the drive it takes to continue recovering?

Part of me wants to believe him, but the other is stuck on the fact that yeah, he might not have wanted to say it, but the word was in his head nonetheless. Why was it there? Maybe he unconsciously does think they are big? And here I am the next day at 4:30 in the morning overthinking this. But damn those 800-1000 calories a day don't sound that bad now...

I don\u2019t really understand what I have going on regarding how I eat. If someone could help me understand I would really appreciate it. \n\nSome questions I have: \n\nis eating 200-600 calories a day, weighing everything out, not feeling comfortable eating food that hasn\u2019t been weighed out, etc. considered heavily restricting?\n\nIs heavily restricting calories considered purging?\n\nI think I binge eat but am not too sure. I tend to eat 200-600 calories a day and then I have one day a week I would smoke weed (I\u2019m sorry if I\u2019m violating any rules) and eat the food I have been craving plus a lot more other things (ranging from 1,700-2,500 calories in about 4-5 hours) Then I start restricting my calories (200-600) for the rest of the week till the next time I smoke. I do feel uncontrollable when I eat but that always happened when I used to get high before I started restricting my calories. Is this just unhealthy dieting? \n\nFor reference: I have \u201cfear foods\u201d I think. I hate eating bread bc of the calories but I do sometimes eat it if it fits in my calorie intake I want for the day, when I do eat bread I do not eat white bread. I will never eat rice, pasta, fries, tortillas, oil, and any drink other than water/tea (this is all other than when I \u201cbinge\u201d) \nI also care a lot about my weight, I check the scale at least 5 times a day, if that matters. \nI do not make myself throw up. \nI am 5 foot and half an inch tall  \n\nI ask if restricting calories is considered purging bc everything I\u2019ve read online says for you to have one of the types of eating disorders you either have to binge AND purge or to have BED you just binge but not purge or restrict calories? \n\n\nThank you \ud83d\udc96", "subreddit": "EatingDisorderHope"}

I had a small stick ice cream after dinner as a dessert in a hope I could monitor there results and decide best how to start again on sugars without falling off the horse. I knew ice cream wasn't something that would set me off but the chocolate in it would be a good test of what to expect going forward.\n\nI figured also sticking to a mini sticked ice cream rather than a tub, I could limit myself to one portion rather than taking a ridiculously big portion.\n\nThere were three things I found when eating the ice cream.\n\n1) The ice cream was delicious, it was a dark chocolate ice cream and the dark chocolate (not normally my favourite) tasted so sweet and good. I think from this I have decided I will try to only eat darker chocolates etc, and make sure it's limited to a small portion or recommended portion on the back.\n\n2) Straight after eating the chocolate, I felt very guilty. Although the chocolate ice cream was delicious it was the feelings of eating sugar that made me feel upset with myself even though I had told myself the one stick was okay. It made me want to stick to no sugar and I think this feeling is going to help in the future. I have decided to limit myself to one sweet treat a week maximum and it must be the correct serving size. \n\n3) My sugar levels again spiked and I had a short period where I really craved sweet food. It didn't last long but it was a quick spike of cravings immediately after the ice cream.", "subreddit": "FoodAddiction"}

My problems lie in restriction, over activity and (arguably the worst) meticulous planning and over control of my intake.\n\nHowever one \"habit\" has been an issue for years and that's hoarding.

This doesn't make me eat it any quicker. It's merely like a security blanket I guess? It's chaos when things don't go to plan and if there's stock issues or recipe changes to my safe brands, it does not bode well. I've made massive improvements though and am currently working to a 2 box limit and for once, every square inch of my tiny kitchen isn't covered with mountains of food boxes. \n\nAnyway. So this past weekend after a lot of planning, I tried something new in line with my meal plan and thankfully, it was a hit!

Cue internal panic. So where do I turn? The Internet of course and hurrah! Amazon has it and in the right flavour too.\n\nHowever, as it turns out, amazon have a minimum \u00a320 spend on food items...\n\nLong story short, I have 8 boxes arriving today and fuck knows where the hell I'm going to put them.\n\nJust when I thought I was beginning to crack this damn behaviour.", "subreddit": "EDAnonymous"}

He\u2019s probably the first person I\u2019ve liked who hasn\u2019t been bad for me in any way. We started dating and we\u2019ve spent several days of almost every week together this summer. Whenever I\u2019m with him, his habits kinda take over mine. We eat breakfast, lunch and dinner, and snacks sometimes too. And yeah that IS normal. But it hasn\u2019t been for me in YEARS. \n\nThe first time we were together for an entire day I was super nervous about not being able to control exactly what I eat and having to appear casual about eating like a normal fricking human. In my mind I was like \u201coh we\u2019re having an entire meal for both lunch and dinner??? We\u2019re actually going to eat breakfast?? Ok don\u2019t panic\u201d but on the outside I\u2019ve been trying to just roll with it because I do really like him and I want to make him happy by eating whatever he cooks.\n\nSurprisingly, it\u2019s been working well. Even when I\u2019m without him my body has adjusted to eating several times a day, never really feeling the need to binge or starve. I didn\u2019t believe in being able to reach that point before, but I accidentally slipped into it because of this guy.\n\nI\u2019m so grateful that he\u2019s changed me in this way but I know it might not be permanent. Thoughts take a lot longer to change than habits and mine are still pretty bad and destructive. I hope this isn\u2019t just a period though, I hope I can change my mindset as well.\n\nI really just wanted to share my experience with you guys because it\u2019s completely changed my view on recovery.

I am also a dancer, so aesthetics is, unfortunately, a big part of having a paying job.\n\nI went home this past weekend and kind of had a breaking point when my mother wanted to take me shopping even though I DID NOT want to go. I tried on a pair of pants that should have fit me pre-ED and found that they didn't fit. I got so discouraged that I confessed to my mom how unhappy I am with my body right now. Which is honestly something I am proud of saying out loud, and proud to say did not lead to any ED related behaviors. \n\nBUT, ever since then both of my parents are constantly saying \"What can I do to help?\" at least once every three hours. And I just don't know how to respond to this. I am already seeing a nutritionist and a therapist. I just feel like a problem that they need to find a solution to when they ask me this. I know that they mean well, but it is just frustrating to deal with. How do I console them/make them feel as if they are helping?

I have gained 5kg in the last 2 years, which was when I was diagnosed with EDNOS/OSFED, depression and anxiety after 10 years of trying all sorts of diets and restricting food and liquid. I had decided that seeing a psychiatrist and therapist was my last option, but that only made me realise that recovery was truly my last and only option (yay).\n\nSome background - I used to measure how much liquid I would drink and the weight of all my food. My lunch would include usually include one pb&amp;banana toast and 100g of liquid, and dinner usually measured to 200-300g of food + liquid.\n\nI have stopped measuring since then, and have been eating and drinking more liquids (probably 1200-1500kcal/day - I don\u2019t count). I have attended reformer pilates 3 times/week for 2 months now (building \u2018em muscles!!) and I still weigh myself before and after meals, often being able to overcome the \u2018mental and emotional\u2019 toll weight gain has on me. But I have struggled to understand the physical part of recovery (ie water weight/retention, weight restoration, etc). I\u2019m still struggling to drink liquids freely and often find myself not drinking/eating water if I\u2019m \u2018heavy\u2019 before a meal. \n\nI have read a lot of threads where people have shared their weight gain experience in recovery (amazing!!!) - however, this is usually from being severely underweight to underweight/normal. I am afraid to eat \u2018normally\u2019 or \u2018intuitively\u2019 now that I have reached \u2018normal weight\u2019 because it seems as though I am gaining weight endlessly and my natural reaction is to eat/drink less the next day so that I wake up the same weight as the day before. I know how much weight I lose overnight (0.3-0.4kg) so I always aim to be 0.3-0.4kg above the weight I would be when I wake up in the morning (after using the toilet) at the end of the day, and would tailor my intake of food and water to adhere to that.  \n\nI am coping better mentally and have overcome tons of my fear foods (even allowing myself a controlled cheat day or two every week, yay!), but I am not sure what to do to take the next step forward. \n\nHow many calories should I be aiming for? Should I be drinking water freely? Will I just keep gaining more and more weight (while consuming the same amount of calories every day) or will I just gain to a point where it stops and then stabilises? \n\nP.s. I\u2019m on vacation now and have gained 2kg in the last 7 days despite walking a lot (probably because I am eating and drinking more/retaining more water?). My challenge for this trip was to be less restrictive and allow myself to gain the extra 2kg, but now that I have and with 2 more weeks to go, I\u2019m absolutely terrified, uncomfortable and struggling mentally... Will I naturally shed off the extra kilos when I go back to my normal diet/routine? \n\nJust wondering if anyone is facing this issue too.

However I started to eat beyond this intake and I would purge so I didn\u2019t go over, plus I had the habit of over calculating my food calories so even when I stopped my \u201cweight loss journey\u201d I was still losing weight but I was always within a healthy BMI range all.

I lost drastic amount of weight in seven weeks. I noticed a lot of red flags in terms of symptoms such as feeling very cold, brittle nails, weak bones and joints. I checked the scale and realised I was underweight I went into panic mode and started eating again it\u2019s been over two weeks and the first ten days I was consuming a lot and since then I\u2019ve been consuming my daily recommended calories but past few days i feel like I\u2019m binging eating everything.\n\nI\u2019ve been reading intuitive eating and other books to help me but I\u2019m lost I don\u2019t know what I\u2019m doing, I need professional help and have tried seeking it but with no luck, went to my GP told him I wasn\u2019t eating and that I may have an ED he checked my weight which should\u2019ve been enough, I felt embarrassed to admit I have an ED but did hint at it I told him that I puke up my food purposely because I\u2019m scared of flare ups of IBS. He\u2019s a POS and scoffed at me for still refusing to take anxiety meds (Zoloft) I see a CBT therapist and I opened up to her and admitted that I have an eating disorder and I go through restrictive periods occasionally purging and overall having a fear of weight gain.

When I look at myself in the mirror I know I\u2019m underweight and I need to gain weight but I just don\u2019t want to go past a certain weight but that\u2019s it, does that make me anorexic? \n\nI just need advice hope this gets accepted", "subreddit": "EatingDisorderHope"}

I told that my diet kind of thing we began three weeks earlier worked well for the first two weeks but had been forgotten. I'd get 1 point for every day that I've eaten less than 300 calories extra (food etc. obviously doesn't count as extra. Extra meant more like trash food, candies, soda etc.) For the first two weeks I had 8 \"day-offs\"/points and 7 binge-days and I thought it looked promising. After that I went back to my normal level resulting 6 days' streak of bingedays. Psychologist quickly realized I wouldn't be back on track regurarly so we gave up the diet.\n\nThen she said: \"So, now you saw diets are easily forgotten and result the same or even more binging long-term\" (a little pause here, she was obviously thinking another solution). \"Have you ever woken up and decided that today I'll binge/eat a lot?\" Of course I hadn't! That would be crazy, right? But that was my homework. To have a binge-day, on purpose. Goal was to have my worst binge ever and she said that if I throw up it's a bonus.\n\nSo, the same day, I went to supermarket already thinking about all the good stuff I could eat just a while later. Cinnamon buns, to the cart. 1kg of candies, straight to the cart. Sodasodasoda. Uhh I think my walking got a little faster there.\n\nBut things got weird once I got to the market. I started getting thoughts I haven't had in a long, long time: \"Do I really want to do this? Is this really smart?\" All of sudden I didn't want to binge. And I'm not talking about not wanting to throw up. No. I didn't want to eat even the littlest bit of anything unhealthy. My thinking had changed from \"I MUST NOT BINGE!!!\" to \"I don't even want to binge\" . Well, I eventually bought one little 100g bag of candies but that's far from my understsnding of binge!\n\nSame thing happened today. I stepped in the shop, thinking I could do it today. Thinking I was \"stronger\" today. But guess who walked out of the shop with empty hands. I feel amazing! Of course it's been just two days, but I'm feeling faithful about this. Like, this could end this torture of my mind and especially my body.\n\nTL;DR: instead of avoiding binge-eating, try to do the opposite and have your worst binge-day ever.

I am pretty shitty with writing things so hop off. This might be long but I am going to describe my current life and would love some suggestions on how to turn my life around.\n\nI did a year long internship at Walt Disney World working at a popular mountain. While working there about halfway through my internship, I snapped and developed an eating disorder. My typical day would consist of bubbly water and two tiny bags of 100 calorie pop chips. It completely destroyed the rest of my time at Disney but it made me skinny. I went down from 220 lbs starting the internship to 135. Upon returning back to my small college town I have gained and lost more weight. It has been non stop going up and down. To give some perspective I am a 5 7 male weighing in last at about 141 lbs. I dont know whether this is good or bad anymore due to my mind and perception being so warped. Recently, I have been encouraged to go out with my friends for drinks and food. I dont want to socially isolate myself and say no like I did during my internship at disney, but I do not want to get fat again. I am currently having a meltdown and one of the worst days of my life because the past two nights i have been going out to drink with friends (and drinking inhibits my judgement and causes me to binge like fucking crazy). I am wearing a hoodie that is 4 sizes too big I look ridiculous but I dont want anyone to see my body. Tonight is my sisters birthday and we are suppose to go out for margaritas and food (of fucking course am I right) and I want to participate and have fun but I dont want to feel like shit about myself. What do I do about my current situatuion? If i try and eat normally I end up binging and then extremely restriciting by fasting a couple of days and then eating low calorie healthy for a couple of days it is an endless vicious cycle that is fucking with me. I can't remember what its like just to wake up in the morning and just eat without thinking about it. This was suppose to just help me lose weight and now I can't even go an hour without a body check or thinking about how I am going to lose weight next. I have been going to the doctor recently and therapist I am on new meds but I don't think it is helping and I think I have far deeper rooted issues that prevent me from making myself vulnerable. I see everything as a joke and not serious and I have a terribly hard time having compassion or showing empathy for people. i often fake it so I seem more human. I also recently havent had much of any emotions. Besides hatred towards myself for being fat and ugly which will never get me a boyfriend, I dont get sad or happy. Does anyone have any advice for me?", "subreddit": "EDAnonymous"}

A few days ago my friend asked me to come out to a work night with her at a bar.\n\nshe told me this morning it's been cancelled, but she's uploaded pics of her and her workmates on her social media. We've been best friends since we were 11 and it's not the first time this has happened. It's usually food orientated so I always understood why she wouldn't ask me, or say it was cancelled when it wasn't. She was sparing both herself and me from my anorexia ruining the night.\n\nI haven't hung out with anyone in weeks now and it's partly my fault, I isolate a lot and try to wiggle my way out of days out where I know a lot of calories will be involved. I only really have two friends and now I feel like I don't have any at all. I've sent my friend a few messages since she uploaded the pics of her at the bar, but she hasn't responded despite opening them. They weren't related to hanging out, I didn't want to seem pushy or confrontational. \n\nI'm so damn lonely. My only other friend is her fianc\u00e9 and they're sorta a package deal. Theyve known about my anorexia for a while now. But I've been asking to meet up every so often and they never respond to those messages, only send me memes or something. I'm scared I'm just a walking eating disorder at this point.\n\nI'm supposed to be her maid of honour but she won't see me. I'm waiting for the day I see their wedding pictures online without even knowing it's happened. I hate to sound so self pitying but I've tried to convince myself it's just paranoia despite constantly being proven wrong.\n\nI don't work or go to education because of my bipolar and anorexia so it's hard for me to make friends. I'm on first-name basis with the staff at my local coffee shop but they're all 60+ and I'm 22.

I've asked them if I have, this has been going on for months, and they always assure me I haven't and we'll hang out soon. But we never do. \n\nI'm just so sad. I've pushed away my only friends because I constantly dodge any situation where I'll be expected to eat. I'm so lonely all the damn time. I bumped into my psychiatrist on the street a few days ago and ..... I was happy to speak to someone, even if it was literally about a minute of small talk.\n\nUgh. Fucking ugh.

I just think it's a really helpful resource.\n\nThis account is run by a woman named Jennifer Anderson. She's a dietician that specialized in a more holistic direction, but she's a scientist as well so everything she says is backed up by multiple studies. She focuses on picky eaters and kids so a lot of her stuff isn't relevant, but she also promoted intuitive eating, healthy relationships with food, and is very ED friendly. I love seeing her instagram stuff because she talks about different strategies for parents on how to develop a healthy food relationship with their children. It's interesting and it helps me in my recovery journey so much. \n\nShe calls her efforts to eating more nutritious food an \"intention\" not a diet, obligation, duty, rule, etc because it doesn't leave room for guilt or blame when she does not follow through. For an ED, recovery is not linear. We slip up, we relapse, sometimes we just don't follow through and Jennifer says *that's okay*. I think that's really important to hear. It's okay to mess up because as long as you have an *intention* to recover, you're still trying and at the end of the day, that's what matters most.\n\nShe also talks about the language she uses with food around her kids to make sure they develop into happy tiny humans. I honestly wish my mom had been this peculiar with language she uses, because Jennifer explain she tries her best to talk about how beneficial and nutritious food is but does not label any food is \"bad\". She promotes helpful language like instead of saying \"salad is healthy\", she suggests \"green food helps you fight off sickness\". It sounds really simplified, but for me, I've had to re-wire my brain to really understand how nutritious something is and what benefits eating it may provide me.\n\nThis instagram has really been helpful to me in that way. Plus her occasional insta story of her kids is always so cute. Maybe it can help someone else too.", "subreddit": "fuckeatingdisorders"}

{"post_id": "d0jqob", "created_utc": 1567790931, "title": "How To Stop A Binge", "author": "hammerprice", "self_text": "I posted this as a reply to another thread, but a couple of people requested that I make this its own post, so here it is! It's my advice for how to stop a binge before it starts, minimise it while it's happening, and avoid falling into a pattern of future binges after one happens. It's really long but hopefully it's helpful \ud83d\ude05  \nI am not a professional or anything, this is just based on my own experiences! Would love to hear your own techniques for avoiding or stopping binges, too. **TW for talking about calorie counting, fasting, and low-restriction.**\n\n..........\n\n**What triggers a binge in you?** Is it boredom? Are you anxious, sad, angry, etc. and you want to eat to cope with it? Is it because of food insecurity, thinking that this is your \"last chance\" to eat, e.g. before bed or because you fear someone will take your food? Are you distracting yourself or procrastinating from something else that you don't want to do and using food as that excuse?\n\nI literally JUST avoided a binge, and I stopped midway through another one earlier, so here's what I did.\n\nFirst, I **recognised why I wanted to binge** \\- in my particular case today, it was a combination of being anxious about some work I have to do, so I wanted to eat to alleviate that anxiety; I wanted to eat as a way of also postponing the work; And I'd noticed a particular food that I wanted to binge on (a snack food I don't often keep in the house), that was hard for me to forget about it once I'd seen it. Those three things are together what gave me the impulse to binge. Different things will trigger me at different times, so it pays to meditate on it each time. One solution won't work for all binges if the root cause is different.\n\nOnce I analysed that, I **redirected** my compulsive binge-energy into something food-adjacent that  would distract me and take up my attention/time/hands until the initial compulsion calmed down. Today, that was making a cup of tea with soy milk, because however many calories are in the soy milk would be much better than the food I wanted to binge on. At other times, I redirect myself to low-cal snacks like pickles, kimchi, chewing gum, or Halo Top, based on whatever food it is I'm craving or compelled to binge. Binges are often related to food insecurity, so eating a high volume of low-calorie foods or other safe foods, e.g. frozen berries, veggie sticks, etc. may be enough to satisfy that anxiety. I find that ofen if I redirect or satisfy that initial burst of compulsion to binge, I can avoid the binge completely.\n\nWhile the kettle was boiling for my tea, I **isolated** the particular food that was triggering the binge-compulsion (very easy in this case, because it was one specific product; not so easy in other cases, if there is even a specific food at all) and **made it harder for myself to access.** It put it in our pantry, which is a pain in the ass to get to ATM because we have to lock it to keep our pets out. So basically, put as many barriers between yourself and the binge-triggering foods as you possibly can, either physically or mentally.  \nPut the food away in a tin, inside another tin, inside a cupboard you don't use. Put it in a bag in your car boot and go back inside. If you live with other people, put it in a common area where people will see you if you go back to get it. If the food can be frozen, then the freezer is a GREAT barrier between me and a binge trigger, because knowing that it has to defrost is often enough of an effort barrier to stop me. If you can't remove the food from you, then remove yourself from the food; go for a walk, take a bath, do some gardening, etc.  \nThis is only useful if you know the desire to binge on that food will eventually subside; if you know a certain food will always trigger a binge, see below.\n\nI also recognised that **aspects of my compulsion were not related to food itself,** i.e. my anxiety. In other cases, it's sadness, loneliness, frustration, etc. So, I made an effort to alleviate that anxiety. I viewed my compulsion to binge as a symptom of my anxiety, and tackled the work that was making me anxious (beginning is often the hardest step) and once I did, my desire to binge dropped drastically. Find a way to alleviate the underlying emotional cause of your binge and you don't have to deal with food at all.  \nIf your binge is caused or exaggerated by **boredom**, find something to do that occupies your eyes and your hands - e.g. knitting, drawing, writing, playing a video game, etc. Look up some tutorials on YouTube. Try an adult colouring-in book. There are plenty of free relaxation and puzzle apps you can use to distract yourself. The key for me is utilising both of my hands, because mindless binge-snacking from boredom is often because I'm restless and need something to keep my hands busy.  \nIf your binges are **triggered by food anxiety,** practice self-talk. Remind yourself that you will be able to eat the food you want to binge on tomorrow, too, and that there is no time limit. If you are afraid that other people will eat your food, take measures to avoid that. Unfortunately if you live in an environment where people may actually take your food despite your best efforts, just keep reminding yourself that you can get more food at a later time. It might not be right away, but it WILL happen SOME time. Practically speaking, you are not going to be without that food forever.  \nSometimes, something as simple as \"If I still want to binge in 20 minutes, then I'll do it\" can help postpone a binge. Just wait for the 20 minutes, then tell this to yourself again for as long as you can sustain it. Usually, if you can wait out the initial compulsion, you can avoid the binge.\n\nIf you DO start to binge, **DON'T fall into the in-for-a-penny-in-for-a-pound mindset. You  CAN stop a binge at ANY time and it WILL be better than if you let the  binge go on.** So you eat an entire block of chocolate - you might be  tempted to think that you've ruined your day so badly, there's no point in trying any more. BUT eating a whole block of chocolate is better than eating a whole block of chocolate AND a bag of crisps AND a pint of icecream, etc. It is always better to pump the brakes, no matter how far you've gone. I was binging earlier and I recognised halfway through that I wasn't really enjoying the food, I didn't need the calories, and I was full, so I forcibly stopped myself and threw the rest of the packet away.\n\nWhich leads me to my next  point - I hate wasting food, but over-eating past my calorific needs until I get uncomfortable, nauseous, lethargic, guilty, etc. is, IMO, still just  as much of a waste. **If I have to get rid of food I don't want in order to stop eating it, then I've learned that's just what I have to do.** I'm fairly friendly with my neighbours so I can sometimes pawn half- or un-eaten food items onto them or my parents, but if worse comes to worst I'm not above throwing food in the trash if I'm in the middle of a REALLY bad binge and it's doing me more harm than good to eat it. The important thing is that you do this when it's BENEFICIAL to you, NOT as a form of punishment to yourself. Sometimes the healthiest thing to do is just let a binge run its course to avoid worse forms of self-harm.\n\nI remind myself (positively, because negative self-talk rarely helps in the long term) about **the reasons why I don't want to binge**, the progress that I don't want to lose, the promises I've made to myself and others, etc. I try not to make them about my appearance. Mostly I focus on how proud of myself I'll be in an hour when I can look back on the binge I DIDN'T have, and how much better and more in-control I will feel. Sometimes I just say \"I don't want to binge, I don't want to eat \\[x\\], I'm choosing not to do this\" out loud, and hearing myself say it helps me believe it.\n\nIf I do binge, or start to binge, then **I keep myself accountable.** I try and keep a level head and take ownership of the fact that I'm binging, and make the conscious choice to eat food, even if it's still a binge, because if I don't and I allow my eating to become mindless, the binge is always worse. I personally track my calories even through a binge because it helps me stay self-aware and regain control over my compulsions faster. BUT everyone is different and some people find that calorie-tracking will make things even worse. Know what's best for you and don't harm yourself by tracking; but if possible, find another way to stay mindful about your intake to avoid falling into a deeper binge. Once you've started binging, allow yourself to enjoy the food, acknowledge that you're eating, etc. If you spend the whole binge in denial that you're eating then of course it's going to be harder to stop!\n\nLastly, if I do binge, and I binge hard, **I DON'T try and compensate the next day.** E.g. after a really massive binge, I'm tempted to think \"Well, if I just fast all day today, then the calories will even out and it'll be like nothing happened!\" ... Yyyeaahhh, the thing is, after a binge, my eating compulsions are ALL kinds of messed up. Trying to force myself to fast or super-low restrict immediately after a binge just triggers my food insecurity to go CRAZY and I am far, far more likely to just binge again... then try and  fast again... then binge again... etc etc.  \nInstead, what I do now -  with a much higher success rate - is **just try and get back to \"normal\".** Whatever the highest level of restriction you're comfortable with, or your \"normal\" eating, not your \"compensation\" eating. Even if that means eating at maintenance for a day or two. If I take things slowly and talk myself through my eating choices, then I am much, much more likely  to regain control over my eating habits and my binge compulsions. If you can't handle the thought of not compensating for a binge, then remember, you can always fast for a little or low-restrict for a little AFTER you have recovered from your binge cycle and are comfortably eating at your normal level, and it will have the same effect. You don't have to do it IMMEDIATELY after you binge. Compensating like this can often just lead to another binge cycle, though, so I honestly just advocate for trying to return to \"normal\" eating after a binge without ever attempting to compensate for it, because preventing future binges is going to be much better for you in the longterm than whatever short-term benefit you think you'll gain from fasting, exercise purging, etc. - **One outstanding binge is better than three successive binges with unsuccessful fasts in-between.**\n\nOh yeah - and I also find that coming and talking to people here helps a ton! \ud83d\ude09", "subreddit": "EDAnonymous"}

This will be especially extremely hard as this week I\u2019m off from work, which means the whole house to myself all week. What do you guys do after a binge? It\u2019s so hard for me not to restrict as I physically cannot put food down after, and the shame is literally unreal.. :(\n\nedit: going to update here to keep myself accountable\n\n1: went for a run this morning, ate lunch out with family but didn\u2019t binge; ate one taco. Feeling optimistic although evenings are my downfall. Gonna sleep early to try to avoid that tonight. Dinner was not the healthiest (korean meat, noodle/kimchi dishes and white rice) but I stopped when I was a little over full. I feel good about it though and no desire to binge! :)\n\n2: went on another run, ate fear/usually binge food for me during lunch: peanut butter on a bagel. I have figured that I can\u2019t buy a jar of peanut butter, as I will finish the whole thing in less than a week. No binges so far; dinner will be a leftover bagel from that place. Not restricting/diet mindset has so far prevented my urge to binge. Confirmed: lying in bed and binge free day!\n\n3: I have noticed that starting the morning off immediately with a workout (today I did a hiit sort of thing) has led me to be successful and not binge for the rest of the day. Irregular lunch bc I went out with a friend-boba and an rx bar. Dinner was rice, meat, veg. Not bingeing feels great!\n\n4: Ran in the morning again, weighed myself and I\u2019m at the same weight as I was before the binges the past 2 weeks! Guess it was water weight after all. Update: checking back on this post has helped me not binge...felt the urge after lunch (dumplings+broccoli) today. Had dinner-rice,salmon,broccoli, mooncake for dessert. Really felt the binge urge today for some reason but reminded myself how great it felt NOT to binge\n\n5: had a really short run, had sweet potatoes, eggs, a dumpling and a peach for breakfast. Had noodles and a mooncake for lunch. Reminding myself not to restrict/not to binge either!\nUpdate: think I had a small binge after dinner but I stopped myself before it went full on into a binge...had rice, broccoli, chicken and then had a bowl of cereal and 2 madeleines\n\nSo it\u2019s a bit after dinner and I hate to say that I had a medium sized binge...ate a bunch of chips and more cereal even though I was full. Not going to upset myself too much, 5 days was an improvement and I will try to go right back on it tomorrow\n\n6: had some cereal and noodles, going to go on a run in an hour!

The most stressful question is, unsurprisingly, \"am I weight restored yet???\" ugh. I am certainly feeling better, but I still feel pretty shitty, and I don't know if that's because I'm not actually weight restored, because my body needs some time at this weight before I start to actually feel better, or because of something else. \n\nWhich leads me to the possibility that is almost as terrifying as potentially needing to gain more weight: \"is there something else???\" I can't believe I ever thought I wasn't sick; now I know how serious this shit is. I'm currently waiting to get labs done and see a cardiologist.\n\nAnd of course, there's the emotional and general life side of things, and the fact that I don't have any sort of eating disorder therapy, I hate where I live and I can't seem to do anything right and I am failing at work and I can't focus enough to send a goddamn email and maybe I could solve that if I could up my ADHD meds but I can't until I figure out what's goin on with my heart and also I am depressed as all hell but I don't want to go on anti depressants !", "subreddit": "fuckeatingdisorders"}

After my cycle went back to normal I started immensely reducing my calories again. Even though I only ate quite little I was constantly bloated.\n\nTo get rid of it I started separating eating and drinking and keeping at least one hour in between both. I went to the doctor and they gave me lots of probiotics which at least helped the cramps but the bloat wasn\u2019t really gone. Just a little less. \n\nOn the weekend something... fascinating happened. If you have a problem with drugs or something you can stop reading now. I want to stress that I don\u2019t promote the use of illegal substances. Not at all. I\u2019m just here to tell my tale. \n\nI took mushrooms and later on MDMA with a good friend of mine. The festival we attended was absolutely amazing by the way but that\u2019s a different story. During the come up of the MDMA we started talking and everyone who knows this substance knows this feeling of immensely deep connection we experienced. I found out he had an eating disorder too which I suspected before but as he didn\u2019t seem to understand how I felt when I talked to him soberly I thought I was wrong about my diagnosis. \n\nBut yea we talked a lot about our issues and I felt the weight of all these problems drop. I\u2019m still fascinated by how these little molecules can alter your whole perception because in these moments of my soul being open to the whole world my friend really got to manifest all this positivity in my mind. I woke up the next day and I was freed. I am free of this whole problem that had way too much control over my life and lead to so much misery. I\u2019m done with this chapter of my life. \n\nAnd now for the bloating part. I stopped eating so much vegetables. I really overdid it on those and my digestive system was completely overwhelmed as they aren\u2019t that easy to digest. Especially if you completely screwed up your digestion as I did... I only took very little probiotics throughout the week but still I experience just a very little bit of bloat. Except for when I overeat. \n\nI can\u2019t believe it.

I didn\u2019t know for a long time if what I do counted as an addiction, but I\u2019ve come to realize it is.\n\nI dieted for a year and lost 35 pounds. I did have my rough patches along the way, but I made it. I was so happy. I could wear clothes that I liked and felt comfortable in. I could wear a swimsuit without covering my midsection. My thighs didn\u2019t chafe when I walked.\n\nBut then, since I had reached my goal, my habits had to change. I couldn\u2019t keep eating 1300 calories a day or I\u2019d start losing muscle, too. I had been on a diet for so long, I didn\u2019t know how to adjust it properly.\n\nI went to Japan for two weeks. Due to my picky palate and dislike of seafood, I ate nothing but fast food for those two weeks. From there, it only got worse.\n\nI stopped taking my anxiety medication. Not on purpose, I just forgot to take it. I was trying to get food under control again, so I ate at weird times and forgot to take my meds when I did (I have to take it with food). This sent me into withdrawal. A symptom of withdrawal for me is insatiable hunger. Literally cannot get enough.\n\nI\u2019ve been trying to get myself back on track for a year. I\u2019ve gained 65 pounds, which means I\u2019m 30 pounds heavier than I was when I started dieting two years ago. I\u2019m not as heavy as many in this sub (5\u20197\u201d female, 205lbs), but it\u2019s hard. I gained 40 of those 65 pounds in only two months. That\u2019s 5 pounds a week. I\u2019m covered in stretch marks because it was so fast.\n\nNothing that worked the first time is working this time. I printed pictures of thin girls in cute outfits (I\u2019m a girl) and taped them to my fridge, front door, car visor, anywhere I might see when I was having cravings. I\u2019ve tried romanticizing healthy food and tea over bad food and coffee, to get myself to look past the lesser taste in favor of the \u201c~ ooh I\u2019m so fancy drinking my tea and eating a rice cake ~\u201d feeling. I have reminders in my phone set to go off every 2-3 hours with motivational phrases specifically tailored to me and my history with my weight. Some are gentle, and some are more aggressive. I need both in balance if I\u2019m going to do this again.\n\nBut I\u2019m so tired. I\u2019m tired of counting calories and telling myself no. I\u2019m tired of looking longingly at the coffee pot while I drink my tea, knowing that having coffee means having coffee creamer, which is too many calories. I\u2019m tired of trying to stick to a diet when hanging out with friends who suggest fast food or baking sweets. I\u2019m tired of feeling left out of social gatherings because beer and wine will break my diet. I\u2019m tired of my family joking that they\u2019re sorry for \u201cbreaking [my] diet\u201d whenever we go out to eat for a special occasion.\n\nI\u2019m also tired of seeing my stretch marks in the mirror. I\u2019m tired of being winded after one flight of stairs. I\u2019m tired of nothing in my closet fitting anymore. I\u2019m tired of sticking my tongue to the roof of my mouth to hide my double chin in photos. I\u2019m tired of hating myself.\n\nI guess I just needed to vent this. I\u2019m craving right now and I need to remember why I\u2019m doing this again. I just want to get back to where I was, and I\u2019m sad and angry that I ever lost it. If anyone has any tips for psychologically beating out this addiction that has already been beaten once, I\u2019d gladly take them. It\u2019s smarter now that it knows how I motivated myself before. I can\u2019t use the same weapons because they don\u2019t work. Thanks for reading.", "subreddit": "FoodAddiction"}

My philosophy is the free will is a skill and that being homeless here would promote major growth within myself and help me overcome many of my set-backs caused by my life being a series of commands by the aliens/being routinely harassed by the CIA (thanks schizoaffective+PTSD caused synchronicities). Overall, this has been the most transformative period of my life; if you've seen Spirited Away, that's the sort of improvement that street life has helped me with.\n\nHowever, with the increased stress of this life, I've found myself returning to old eating habits. In high school, I regularly binged and purged in secret, obsessing over my body/nutrition as I ran track on a national level and needed to be perfect. I've overcome that through making systems for myself, but that is going to be difficult here because of how abundant food is. There are several places that provide free meals, and on my most depressed days, I lined up for every meal and got seconds, and even thirds a few times. The clerk at 7/11 knows who I am because I regularly give in to impulses for sugar, and he even makes snide comments about my diet.\n\nI'm an addict by nature; the trauma of my life has made me always have that compulsion to fulfill some \"need.\" Along with food, my addictions have included alcohol, drugs, smoking, sex/masturbation, stealing, video games, and putting myself in adrenaline-inducing dangerous situations. I'm actually very happy with myself that I can still easily resist the urge to delve into some of these habits, although I have stolen some candy and ice cream from a couple stores out of impulse, but I've gotten my head straight with that again.\n\nOverall, I can't beat myself up, given that I am not spiraling into total self-destructive tendencies, and I don't feel the sort of shame I used to which made me purge. But therein lies the problem. I have no desire to fix this, outside of a rational awareness that this is going to have consequences. Hell, my brain is twisting reality and creating synchronicities that tell me that eating is good because it will give me breasts (gender non-conforming; trying to present more feminine).\n\nI'm working out on the street, running from place to place and doing things like push-ups/sit-ups on the sidewalk. I'm doing this primarily for my mental health, to wade off depression, and it's not turning into the masochistic work outs I used to do.\n\nI don't even know what to do/ask here. I want to improve, but I don't know how to out-think my impulsive mind as I go about the city. Maybe I just want to share so that I can get more motivation to improve, as I've never really talked about any of this with anyone other than one therapist, and then only as a passing topic that got buried under the bulk of my issues (I'm serious the Illuminati is trying to ruin my life so I can't wake people up from the Matrix).", "subreddit": "EDAnonymous"}

I hate the thought that for half of my life I've either been trying to recover or I was in the midst of an ED.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBut I'm scared too. I went to an ED doctor and nutritionist recently. They checked my vitals and said that the difference in my resting heart rate vs standing is borderline dangerous. They said it was a difference of 31 heartbeats and 35 is where things can get critical. They told me I needed to eat more. 3 large meals and snacks in between. They also said my blood pressure was a little low, but it has been my whole life. Even times where I have eaten whatever I wanted and didn't exercise, I've always been thin. I am scared that if I take recovery seriously that I will not only gain weight but gain unnecessary weight. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI am not even severely underweight mind you.

I used to be in a toxic relationship for about 1,5 years and though it was horrible I was terrified to be without him. My friends started distancing themselves from me and I felt a lot of anger from my closest friends because they didn't understand why I didn't leave the relationship. Now I don't feel any connection with my friends, and I don't feel that I ever want to see them. Depression, man. My mom forced me to cut off my partner because she believed I wouldn't make it out alive if I continued. She told me it looked like a drug addiction. That the thought of never talking to him gave me panic attacks, screaming no I can't I can't I can't I'll die. My mom took me far far away from the city with her. \n\nSO here I am 800 km away from social life and school and \"friends\". And I have nothing. So I have feelings about wanting my eating disorder back. Though that's just idiotic and yes I know, it wont make anything better. But I've noticed I've lost some weight and it just, just makes me feel like I have some control. Or some purpose to be here for a week. Also my partner always said that \"you'll never go back to that, understand?\", so uhm maybe this is fueled by that too. \n\nI realize now this is quite pointless to write but, maybe someone understands this.

This is my third weekend at home and at first I was finishing all the stuff and doing all the right things but as soon as I started going to school again, I started hiding food, secretly running up and down the stairs with my very heavy bag at break times, taking toilet breaks only to run up and down the stairs, running a mike or two with my heavy ass schoolbag and walking all the way home, and I have been so close to purging it is unreal. The only thing stopping me was the fear of smelling like vomit in the middle of school and the lack of privacy at home.\n\n I have only had one outpatient so far (I lost weight, what a shocker) and literally all I have to gain is a whole 2kg. That's it. They might ask me to gain more on top of that but for now, that is literally it , and for some reason, I can't stop cheating.

I can't go back to not hiding and cheating, because my ED will only let me feel satisfied once I do more and more and more and keep pushing it.

I rolled my eyes over the phone, feeling frustrated and misunderstood. Did I *really* need to go? I *felt* fine. As soon as she hung up, my thoughts and emotions froze, leaving only one thing on my mind: \u201cYou need to exercise if you\u2019re going to sit in a waiting room\u201d. I obeyed.\n\nA few hours later I was admitted for cardiac abnormalities secondary to my eating disorder.\n\nThe voice that told me to exercise when my heart was in critical condition is the same voice that follows me around every day. When I take transit, it tells me not to sit down, and god forbid I take the escalators. When I follow my meal-plan it tells me I\u2019m greedy and failing. When I\u2019m invited for lunch it tells me not to go, insisting that others around me are trying to make me fat.\n\nI am now eight months into recovery, and still argue with this voice thousands of times every day. The only way to completely shut it off is by doing what it says. As enticing as it sounds to have this constant battle with yourself every day, I didn\u2019t choose this. It is absolutely exhausting, and at times I feel so drained from the chatter that I end up giving in and doing what it wants me to do. For me it\u2019s not a matter of just \u201cchoosing recovery\u201d, as so many people prescribe it to be.\n\nIgnoring the thoughts and choosing to go out for lunch is tremendously hard. At times I find myself paralyzed when ordering, feeling incapable of \u201cchoosing recovery\u201d and I end up getting what my eating disorder voice deems \u201csafe\u201d. I decided I wanted a life without anorexia when I put myself on treatment waiting lists. Wanting a life outside of an eating disorder doesn\u2019t mean making a single choice to recover, it means having to make thousands of choices every day while ignoring the screaming in your head.\n\nThe idea that you can choose recovery minimizes how difficult it is to stop eating disorder behaviours. I told myself over and over: *tomorrow is going to be different, I don\u2019t want to feel like this anymore*, but I wasn\u2019t able to change much without specialized treatment. Even within the eating disorder community, I have been shamed for having slips because I\u2019m not \u201cchoosing recovery\u201d. If it was as simple as choosing recovery, there wouldn\u2019t be millions of people suffering from eating disorders. People wouldn\u2019t need to return to treatment, and eating disorders wouldn\u2019t have the highest mortality rate of any psychiatric illness.\n\nI wish it was as simple as choosing recovery. It would make it a hell of a lot easier for me and all of my supports if I could simply make the choice to get better.\n\nI am trying.\n\nIf someone you love is struggling with an eating disorder, be patient with them.

I'm schizophreniform and have some sort of stamina/fainting condition that doctors still aren't sure about.) and paying rent on one salary is hard.\n\nAnyway, I've been... I don't wanna say recovered, but I've been eating regularly for about a year. This is in large part thanks to my girlfriend being supportive and coaxing me into eating something every day. But, I haven't been losing weight, largely because trying to have a healthy and weight losing diet while actively having an ED is outrageously hard.\n\nSo... the first day we're driving back, we stop to get some lunch. It's my dad, my girlfriend, and myself. This restaurant is like a more upscale McDonalds (Burgerville for my NW friends) so they have small meat burgers and big meat burgers. I don't usually like big meat (in any sense of the word. I'm a lesbian.) so instead of one big meat burger, I got a couple of small meat burgers and fries. My dad kind of scoffs when he hears my order and says \"Well, at least we know your appetite is okay.\" My girlfriend had to comfort me almost immediately and beg me to eat, but this experience has taught me not to eat in front of my dad anymore, and I still haven't since being home.\n\nAnyway, our money situation is super tight at the moment. Moving isn't cheap, my girlfriend is looking for work, and my disability checks aren't coming in yet. We have our deposit coming in sometime this month, but we don't have a lot of money right now. My brain has been screaming at me that the easiest way for us to conserve money is for me to stop eating. I have thoughts like this every day and it basically won't shut up. So every time we spend money to feed me when I could be starving, I feel guilty.\n\nYesterday was the worst. I went to visit an old friend and hang out, the last time I saw him, he was bigger than me. Now he's thin, like really thin, and he looks amazing. Good for him, but I can't help but feel insanely jealous. I'm not usually jealous of guys for obvious reasons, but I was insanely jealous of his weight loss.\n\nI want to go back to heavy restricting and starving myself the way I was prior to dating my girlfriend. I feel awful. I feel hideous and fat. I feel way too big and I hate it so so so much. I want to be tiny, thin, petite, lean, slim. I want to look borderline emaciated. I want to be so thin people worry. I want to be pretty. I'm so tired of being fat. I'm so tired of hating myself and hating how I look. I would already be back on heavy restriction if it weren't for my girlfriend. But instead of that, I'm seeking support and commiseration on here.\n\nI feel like I'm snapping y'all. I can't take it. I just want to wake up and be thin and pretty. I seriously hate this so much.\n\nS0 yeah, that's my rant.", "subreddit": "EDAnonymous"}

I wanted to share what I think of as my \"secret to success\" just in case it works on a single other person.\n\nThe goal is to focus compmetely on becoming my alter ego, Skinny Cool Girl. \n\nSCG is basically my imaginary role model, who is me from the future and is essentially me except she is super hot and climbs mountains and is friendly and adventurous and has lots of tattoos and dogs and is buddhist.\n\nI wasnt doing so well on the hot part. Body dysmorphia or not I'm still not sure, but damn it I want to be SCG!\n\nSo I decided to...start something *else* SCG does (besides look good). To start rock climbing. To get my first tattoo. To start hiking. To try a kickboxing class. To go out with friends. I just went \"skinny dipping,\" no pun intended. My next step is to go dancing for the first time. I'm planning a backpacking trip for next summer. I'm going to class so I can get the degree SCG has.\n\nSCG doesnt like everything she tries, but she tries anything. And she doesnt wait for other people to suggest things, she thinks of things she wants to do and seeks them out.\n\nBasically *I* dont want to do those things, but SCG does. And I want to be SCG. So I go, and I have had a great time and maybe I'm getting a little bit closer to being her.\n\nWhat I'm saying is: who will you be when you are YOUR Skinny Cool Girl? Will you go skydiving? Will you sing karaoke? Will you dress in bright bold clothes? Will you flirt with someone? Will you eat balanced meals, or apply for a better job? Will you perform or display your art? Will you go to bed on time?\n\nWhat leap will you take someday in order to become her? When will she do *insert activity here* for the first time?\n\nCan you make it happen now?\n\nTake one of the things future SCG has about her that you dont have, that isn't weight related, and go do it in the body you own and operate at this moment.\n\nThe brain, your soul, who you want to be does not change after you lose weight. Go be her. You have to *become* her still. Weight is only a small part of the equation. You'll catch up to SCG. Dont waste time while you think you're fat not being cool girl, or else you'll lose the weight and find out that SCG doesn't exist yet.", "subreddit": "EDAnonymous"}

If you scroll down my profile you probably saw that I made a reddit text a few months ago describing my healthy weight loss. \n\nHaha. I wish. Or more like, I thought it was. \n\nToday, right now, 5 minutes after it happened I'm writing this now. I had a 20.000 calorie binge today. 20 f-ing thousand calories. I gained nearly 16 pounds from all the food weight inside me right now. \n\nMaybe you have seen my former post, I'm 5'7-5'8. I was in the 200+ pounds weight range for a large portion (pun) in my life. But since December I've decided to change. From 200 to 119 pounds in a mere 8 months. I thought I was healthy, I truly did. But since last month I've seen that I'm anorexic. I am afraid of over 400+ calories. I weigh every single thing, I fast for 3+ days at a time, and since last week I've binged on 3k calories every day and today 20k now. It devastates me. I weigh 135 pound in this very moment, probably from food weight but I know that I must have gained after this week long binge.  And I'm shaken up. I want to be on the 2-Numbers weight range till Halloween. I'm fucked up\n\n\"Mimimi but Op why are you making this post?\" To spread awareness. Now that I'm a lot skinnier I still feel like shit. I feel disgusting. I'm never thin enough. \n\n\"What about a doctor?\" You see, I'm not underweight yet for them. My hands look like sticks but my torso and legs aren't bad yet. I lose weight in the upper part of my body so fast, my eyes are sunken in, my collar bones are cup holders, my hair is falling out, my hands are bones. But my stomach and hips and thighs? Phew boy. Those are chunky and those are usually where they meassure your BMI. My doctor even told me I can lose some more weight just a few weeks ago. So no and yes. Yes I'm going to a doctor. No I'm apparently not getting help.\n\nRight now I'm sitting crying on the floor, my stomach and face are bloated, there are 3 empty peanut butter jars here, 2 ramen packs, a nutella jar, 4 ice cream cups, 5 chocolate bars, candied nuts, a whole empty loaf of toast, 2 microwaveable spaghetti packages, a  cake slice, and some bread and so many sauces and pringles and energy drinks. And you know what? I can't remember most of it. I only remember eating as fast as I can. As if I'm being hunted or preparing for hibernation.\n\nI don't know what to do if I'm honest. I have body dysmorphia. I can't see myself. I want to have a thigh gap I want this or that or those and ahhh. I totally lost the point of why I'm writing this. My mind is still foggy and weird. My doctors won't take seriously. All I want to say is... please stay safe. \n\nYou will NOT be happy once you're thin. It will NOT be a magical cure to your problems. Get a therapist. Don't end up like me. Eating disorders are scary. They control you. And now I experienced both ends of the spectrum. \n\nStay safe. Don't end up like me.", "subreddit": "fuckeatingdisorders"}

How did you get over the thought of one more person knowing about everything? \n\nI\u2019m going crazy. So far I\u2019ve had two sessions with my therapist, and this is my first experience with therapy in general. After the first session I was upset with myself for not telling her about my binge/fast cycles, so I emailed her basically confessing everything. At the following second session, she basically told me I have a food addiction. This is what\u2019s driving me crazy. The thoughts in my head have gone haywire since she said that. It makes me feel like the same person I was 8 months ago (78 pounds heavier), because that person I would agree probably had a food addiction. But for her to tell me I have one now, it basically validated all the thoughts that have been telling me to shut up and stop worrying about having a problem because I\u2019m too fat to have a problem. My doctor who has been prescribing me phentermine to help me to lose weight (before all of this escalated) has also been referring to my problem as binge eating since I started seeing her late last year. I just feel like I\u2019ve been labeled as the fat person with a food addiction, once again. So maybe I am just addicted to food. Maybe it is just binging and I\u2019m being over dramatic about the rest of it. I truly don\u2019t even know anymore. The thoughts in my head are more aggressive since that last session than they ever have been. I can\u2019t think straight or do anything else I know I should be doing.

About a year ago, in a bid to lose weight I started being \u201cstricter\u201d with my diet. Over time I gradually started restricting more and more and I developed strict rules about how much I was ate, what I ate, when I ate etc. At its worst it got very extreme, and I ate very little in a day. I don\u2019t want to say it was anorexia because I can\u2019t diagnose myself but I had pretty much all the textbook symptoms.  \n\nThen it reached a point where I was finding it harder and harder to restrict what I was eating, so I started letting myself eat a bit more then making myself vomit afterwards. This lasted for about 2 months. At this stage I knew I had a real problem and I managed to basically just pull myself out of it, because I knew I was going to do serious damage if I didn\u2019t. \n\nThis is where the problem comes in. When I started eating again I went through a phase of extreme hunger. I ate absolutely anything and everything, whatever I wanted, whenever I wanted. I don\u2019t eat such large amounts anymore but now I have a bit of a problem with chocolate and junk food. I let myself eat these in \u201crecovery\u201d because I didn\u2019t want to restrict myself anymore, but now I don\u2019t know where to draw the line with what I eat.\n\nMost importantly, even though I am no longer starving/purging, I feel like I am still stuck in that mindset. I feel fat and I hate how much weight I have gained since I started eating again. I miss how powerful I felt when I didn\u2019t eat and the compliments people used to give me when they saw how much weight I\u2019d lost. It gave me self confidence which has been completely shattered. I feel like I\u2019ve let myself go and I rarely leave the house anymore because I don\u2019t want to be seen. I want to go to the gym and be fit and healthy but I\u2019m scared I\u2019ll end up with exercise bulimia. \n\nI\u2019m trying to treat my own eating disorder but that\u2019s never going to work. I really want to see a mental health professional but I\u2019m scared they won\u2019t help me since I don\u2019t *technically* have an eating disorder anymore. I still have all the baggage that goes with it though and I don\u2019t think I\u2019ll ever be fully recovered unless I actually address these issues. When I went to the doctors about bad depression a few years ago they wouldn\u2019t help me because I wasn\u2019t suicidal, so I fear the same thing is just going to happen again.\n\nAny advice would be greatly appreciated.", "subreddit": "EatingDisorders"}

Is it wrong of me to feel this way about her \u2018diagnosis\u2019? Should I accept it?\n\nI finally told my therapist everything. Well, I emailed it all to her prior to my session like the little chicken that I am but it counts. Basically I go through periods of binging and fasting. Fasts consisting of protein shakes, coffee, and zero solid foods and the most recent lasting a month). I have also used laxatives on occasion. Anyways, she told me that what she would call what I\u2019ve been doing, or dealing with food addiction. This kind of took me by surprise. A year ago, I would have agreed. My life was basically one big emotional binge. I didn\u2019t know any other way to eat. However now, now I hate myself for eating, and it feels like I\u2019m doing what I should be doing as long as I\u2019m not eating.\n\nThis is what\u2019s driving me crazy. The thoughts in my head have gone haywire since she said that. It makes me feel like the same person I was 8 months ago (and significantly heavier), because that person I would agree probably had a food addiction. But for her to tell me I have one now, it basically validated all the thoughts that have been telling me to shut up and stop worrying about having a problem because I\u2019m too fat to have a problem. My doctor who has been prescribing me phentermine to help me to lose weight (before all of this escalated) has also been referring to my problem as binge eating since I started seeing her late last year. I just feel like I\u2019ve been labeled as the fat person with a food addiction, once again. So maybe I am just addicted to food. Maybe it is just binging and I\u2019m being over dramatic about the rest of it. I truly don\u2019t even know anymore. The thoughts in my head are more aggressive since that last session than they ever have been. I can\u2019t think straight or do anything else I know I should be doing. I\u2019ve lost the one close friend I had here and I\u2019m literally across the country from home and family.

Reason: Stomach ulcers and acid reflux. Could not eat a thing without nausea, hence eat less outside (but I worked then so yeah, majority of time outside). I never vomited.\n* August: stopped working for vacation and health recovery. Went to hospital and dietary advisor.\n* Now have been taking medicine to treat ulcers and acid reflux for 1 month.\n* From could-eat-hardly-any-calories-per-meal beginning of August, I have improved gradually to eat normal-amount-per-meal. But usually I manage to eat less than I need per meal, which is frustrating  to me.\n* Had a flu (with diarrhea and a lot of vomiting) last Friday and then all my efforts were gone. I lost the precious kg I'd just gained and now my stomach is also back to 1st August: tiny meals. I also don't want food and feel slight nausea when passing food's image or smell. (I still feel hungry.)\n\nI just want to ask for advice or simply sympathy.\n\nI am lost in various categories of eating disorders and could not find my category. So if anyone can enlighten me, yep please thank you so much!!\n\nAlso, I want to ask if anyone has a similar case? How could you improve your health (and gain weight, ofc!)?Should I exercise or not because my dietary advised me not to do gym or serious yoga (which were all my plans) due to my cannot-eat-anything?\n\nAs I browse the net, all advice for weight gaining is doing lifting and eat more calories. Upon reading those articles, all I want to do is cry a lot and hate myself, which then leads to worse stomach condition because of the whole mental health's effects on stomach's wellbeing. Also worth noting that I was diagnosed with emotional disorder (I know it's too broad but...) and haven't had chance to continue more with treating my mental health properly.

Why can\u2019t I eat bread? Because it has carbs. Why are carbs a bad thing? Because they make me gain fat. So why is fat bad? Because it doesn\u2019t look good. Who is deciding what looks good?

While the BBC briefly mentioned ARFID in their article, their title heavily capitalized on the stigma around picky eating, and other articles even went as far as to blame the victim, calling him fussy, or to blame his family.\n\n[https://sciencebasedmedicine.org/a-british-teenager-is-blind-but-not-because-of-junk-food-or-fussy-eating/](https://sciencebasedmedicine.org/a-british-teenager-is-blind-but-not-because-of-junk-food-or-fussy-eating/)\n\nThat boy suffered from ARFID, Avoidant/Restrictive Food Intake Disorder. ARFID is a more recent discovery among food disorders, being only a few years old, making it a recent addition to the DSM5.\n\nARFID is characterized by an unwillingness to eat anything except for certain \"safe foods.\" People with ARFID come in all shapes and sizes and vary in what their safe foods are and how many they have. For some, ARFID seems to stem from childhood experiences with food, but that doesn't hold true for all. They often blame texture for why they don't like new foods. For someone with ARFID, trying new foods causes great anxiety or even panic attacks. Trying something new comes with the fear of throwing up. It doesn't matter how hungry you are, with ARFID, one will gladly starve instead of eating a non safe food.\n\nWith the stigma around picky eating, it's often difficult for someone with ARFID to eat out at restaurants or at friends' houses. People try to push eating new things without understanding how difficult ARFID makes it, and if you turn down any offers of food, people become worried or judgemental. People wonder how you can say you don't like a food you've never tried. Sometimes parents who's children have ARFID will force them to try new things or try to wean them off safe foods, but this tends to do more harm than good. More info here: [https://notapaperjournal.wordpress.com/2019/09/06/arfid-awareness-101/](https://notapaperjournal.wordpress.com/2019/09/06/arfid-awareness-101/)\n\nThere's very little awareness about ARFID compared to other eating disorders, and it can be hard to find information about it. Right now, our subreddit is having a mass growth because of the BBC article. Many of us have suffered ARFID all our lives thinking that we were alone, suffering some strange, nameless thing that nobody else has. If you think you or someone you know may be suffering from ARFID, you are not alone.\n\nWe may not have a national ARFID day, but we have a support subreddit over at [/r/ARFID](https://www.reddit.com/r/ARFID) . We also have a discord server you can join from there. Our subreddit has a WIP food encyclopedia pinned, which may help ARFID sufferers find foods that are very similar to their safe foods to try.

I\u2019m 17 years old, and been suffering from BED for 5 years, onset from emotional abuse. I\u2019ve moved onto a healthier living situation since then. For a time in my junior and senior years, my binging was heavily triggered by stress I encountered in school. In the past 9 months or so I think it\u2019s gotten worse. There are come weeks where i binge multiple nights in a row. \n\nIn school, i used to save my lunch money to buy binge food just so i had it just in case i needed it. So, many times i didn\u2019t have to pay for it myself. Sometimes i have to spend my own money on it... but recently... I\u2019ve been able to ask my mom to buy it for me. It\u2019s very ritualistic, i buy the same things ever week to binge on. Very specific brands of the food I eat for it. So.. with very detailed instructions.... my mom is able to buy my binge food if i ask her to. She obliges me and does so. \n\nMy mother also budgets using this folder method from Dave Ramsey, so we have a set grocery budget and... if i have run out, i can just ask my mother for some money from the grocery budget and i can buy it. My binging is bankrolled by my mother, and i don\u2019t know if she knows. The only thing she noticed is how quickly I go through the eggs. I binge at night after she has gone to sleep, so she just knows that i cooked but that\u2019s all. \n\nSo... to the title of this post. The food i binge on is very unhealthy. Ramen is packed full of sodium, and eating 5 eggs at once cannot possibly be healthy. Of course it is not 5 eggs every time, but even 3 cannot possible be good. I\u2019m young, but i am worried for my heart. I\u2019m tired of being so fat. I\u2019ve gained so much weight over my teenage years and it\u2019s very hard to find clothes that fit. It\u2019s very isolating. I just want to get back into a  healthy weight. I want to be able to wear the clothes i want to. \n\nI\u2019m ready to change, and i want to lose weight. I don\u2019t know how exactly i will tackle the emotional side of things, given i won\u2019t have health insurance for another 6 weeks so I can\u2019t go to therapy or talk to a psychiatrist about possibly getting on medication for it like others on this sub. Since i know i cannot binge in anything but my ritual foods.... my solution for now is to stop buying it all together. Stop telling my mother to buy it for me. Asking her to buy some healthier things like fruit or salad or something instead.  Work on my portions and dieting and just. Trying to change.

I also have bulimia nervosa and OCD (according to my old psychiatrist, they work together). I used to have a BMI that I was happy with 2 years ago. At the time, I wasn't happy with it, but when I look back, I looked so decent. It was a healthy BMI too. I was engaging in very bulimic behaviors, but overall, I was OK. Then, I got into and out of a physically abusive relationship. I spent a lot of time after that going through a sort of \"treat myself\" phase, include music festivals/concerts, food, going out with friends, spending as much money as I wanted while barely making rent, etc. Honestly, it was deserved. I was working full time, a straight A student at my university doing a double major, constantly just working and studying and never being kind to myself and I probably wouldn't have recovered as soon as I did had I not treated myself and surrounded myself with friends and fun. At that point, my bulimia sort of went on pause because part of treating myself was allowing myself to enjoy the food without shaming myself.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHowever, during that time (it was only 1 summer that I did this, so about 3 months), I gained 10 pounds. I'm 4'11. 10 pounds is A LOT on my body. I have tried on and off to lose it and I never have. It is two years later. I am back to a grind of working full time and studying 20 hours a week for the LSAT (law school entry exam, think SAT but for law school) while trying to squeeze in family, friends, the gym, etc. I have gained another 2 pounds on top of the 10. I literally hate my body. I can't buy new clothes because when I try on clothes I just cry. I eat relatively healthy too! Greek yogurt for breakfast, salad for lunch, veggies for dinner, maybe some almonds or a string cheese or fruit as a snack throughout the day. I want to go back to being bulimic again to lose this weight. I have tried the healthy route. I rock climb at the gym 3x a week for about 2 hours. I eat pretty healthy but I have a crazy appetite. I hate my body. I saw myself in the mirror this morning and cry. I just got a dress in the mail for like 10 bucks and I was like oh this will be cute and I tried it on and was like wow I could never wear this. I just hate hate hate hate my body so much. I will never been thin and tall. I will never have control over my body again. I'm so sad. Everyone says this is probably where my body should naturally be, weight wise, but I am 10 pounds away from being overweight and I feel awful about myself and I don't want my body to be like this but I have tried so hard.", "subreddit": "EDAnonymous"}

When you don't product enough dopamine, you don't feel normal, which causes your body to try and level it out.  This is done by craving things that up the dopamine in your system.  This can be drugs, food, exercise, video games, movies, sex, etc.  Among a lot of other things, I'm more focusing on the BED behaviour aspect of ADHD.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFor me, I didn't get enough dopamine, so I would need to find ways to up it.  When I was very low, the easiest fix was food.  I'd binge on carbs to get it leveled out.  Another thing that helped, and also counter acts the problems with overeating is exercise.  It releases dopamine and a calming affect.  So over exercising and over eating are just ways to level out dopamine to a normal level.  This was my entire life.  When I got tired of exercising, I'd jump weight.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhen someone has so low dopamine, mundane tasks are boring.  They don't give the person that huge dopamine jump like other tasks do.  Cleaning the dishes should be motivational for a normal person, but since its so little dopamine for ADHD persons, they don't want to do it.  They'd rather do something easier / more reward.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThat's why taking a stimulant works for an ADHD person as a calming agent, and not a \"stimulant\".  It normalizes their dopamine.  The high reward / dopamine tasks aren't really that necessary, and normal tasks become \"fun\" / motivational again.  Food isn't a big deal anymore, because they don't need the dopamine, which lets them actually cue into hunger levels, and not for fixing brain levels.", "subreddit": "BingeEatingDisorder"}

Well today marks 15 days since I last had a binge episode. Sure, I've had a couple meals here and there where I've eaten more than I really needed to, but not any actual binges. After my last binge, I started journaling freely about my experiences and how I was feeling after that binge. I kept up the journaling, and it's been helping me work through some emotions and keep me from bingeing. I'm hoping to keep this streak going for as long as I can. \n\nThanks for reading! :)", "subreddit": "BingeEatingDisorder"}

The dude is like 6\u20192, incredibly handsome, works out, studies engineering, amazing teeth and energy, but still struggles with self esteem, BAD. \n\nAnyways, I\u2019m always blown away when he says something about feeling ugly because I tell no jokes when I say this man is a solid 9.5/10 by universal  standards. I was listing off all the attractive qualities about him in an attempt to make him feel better (like that EVER works with anybody), and he finally breaks: tells me he grew up really chubby and got thin in the beginning by severely restricting food. Even after losing the weight and seeing how people treated him differently he couldn\u2019t shake the vision of himself he formed as a kid: fat, ugly, unloveable. If anything, \u201cglowing up\u201d made him more insecure. I understood exactly what he meant. \n\nI grew up with cystic acne, chubby, awkward. I had no friends, nobody took me seriously, nobody saw me. Cue my junior year of high school, an eating disorder, platinum dyed hair and accutane and suddenly the world is full of generosity, kindness, respect and attention. I saw the stereotypical mold of beauty and shoved myself into it, no matter the cost on my physical and mental health, and it proved 100% of my fears about people treating me badly because I was \u201cugly\u201d. \n\nMy friend and I both agreed that \u201cglowing up\u201d didn\u2019t make us any more confident: in fact, it made us more paranoid and kinda justified our bad ED behavior. We know what it\u2019s like to be \u201cugly\u201d, and we know how much better life treats you when you\u2019re thin and \u201cpretty\u201d.  We\u2019ll do anything not to go back, and we\u2019re constantly terrified that we somehow transformed back into what we once thought we were without realizing it. That we\u2019re \u201cfat\u201d again. We know it happened once and know that it could happen again. \n\nBoth of us know that in reality our version of \u201cfat\u201d is probably closer to healthy, and don\u2019t judge anyone else but ourselves based on these impossible standards.

I gained a bit of weight in middle school and my mom became super focused on my weight and intake from then onward. I would field comments constantly, and I know she was truly worried but she would express it angrily and in a very controlling way. Sometimes she could make pretty harsh comments like, \"Do I need to lock you in your room?\" (to stay out of the kitchen). She would also mock me in ways that painted me as being selfish for not eating or exercising within the regimens she created for me. I felt pressure to eat meals with my parents to appear normal, but also felt an uncontrollable urge to eat as much as I possibly could when I was alone or away from them. I continued gaining weight and was overweight throughout most of high school.\n\nAt the time I think binge eating was my way of trying to regain control over my life and body. It was my way of saying \"you can't control me.\" I didn't start recovering until into my college years when I felt more independence and distance from my mom and dad. I still relapse sometimes, usually when I am feeling a lack of control in my relationships or work, but I have a better understanding of what triggers me.\n\nLooking back, I think what would have helped me in high school would be more freedom from my parents and a job. I think that responsibilities outside of schoolwork, and having money of my own would have given me a stronger feeling of control over my life. If I ever have a child that is struggling with food, I will make it clear that I am always there for them, but I think I will also encourage them to engage in activities that empower them to be independent and self-sufficient.\n\nLots of love to anyone who is struggling and feeling powerless.

Let\u2019s just say I guess I was never serious about getting the body I wanted and thought I could cheat my way around it and it worked but that only depended on my binges and how often I purged. The more I binged the more I ate usually I would end up gaining weight then it would just be a cycle of me gaining weight because it got out of control for two weeks then results in me doing intense sweating exercises/ bulimia / Anorexia to really get the results I wanted and yes I got them, but that didn\u2019t mean I was going to stay there for long at all.  Sometimes I would for a couple weeks maybe a couple months but nothing crazy. \n\nSo this past month and a half I only relapsed like 2x which I felt was amazing I was feeling proud of myself and at the same time I wasn\u2019t keeping track of my weight on my scale which was one of the main factors of why I care so much about my weight.  To now weighing myself for the first time in the past month and a half and I gained around 15 pounds. And I\u2019ve really been trying to watch what I eat by that I mean I would regulate all my binges try to stay with two meals a day because I don\u2019t wake up early for breakfast usually, ( I also usually eat diner around 12:30-1 am this past month and a half I know eating late is bad but I eat after the gym should I stop? ) so I thought I was doing good. \n\nMy girlfriend wants me to go see a doctor/ therapist I honestly don\u2019t care about a therapist like I know why I\u2019m like this, I\u2019m only open to the doctor side I haven\u2019t gotten my blood work done like in a couple years, she\u2019s worried I might have more underlying problems since it\u2019s been so long. I feel like she could be right and wrong I would only benefit the doctor if like I could get some diet pills or something or is there any problem I should actually be worried about. Part of me feels like my body is fucked right now and can\u2019t work properly digestively ( even tho it got better than a month and a half ago but I still have bad digestive problems ) I feel like something is off that I really absorb like 20x the calories I\u2019m actually eating. And I do cardio as well I\u2019ve been a more cardio person then weight lifting these past 5 years I don\u2019t consider me to out of shape I can run a 9 min mile at least. \n\nSo why did I gain this weight? Thats so much to me I understand my diet is not strict but should I try to buy macro plans a personal fitness to try to incorporate more? This is my worst fear, this is why I purge, this is what makes me hate my body sometimes and it\u2019s making me want to relapse but I know that\u2019s not the way to go I\u2019m never going to Achieve what I want with myself. At this rate am I just going to keep gaining weight this fast? \n\nShould I be worried about other things?

I'm now in 11th grade, so it's been seven or eight rough years ever since I first started obsessively weighing myself and ate one egg every two or three days. I'm not really recovering; it's a side effect from living in South Korea and having parents that think of therapy the same way medieval people must've thought of smallpox. \n\nBut this rant isn't about me; I've grown taller while 'maintaining' the same weight from 8th grade, so my mother doesn't really fat-shame me. No, she moved on to my sister.\n\nShe's a year older than me, so she's writing college applications and is generally stressed out. Despite this, she manages to be a good sister in all regards. She exercises for an hour every single day, and I don't think I've ever seen her eat ice cream or any sweets ever since two years ago. She eats healthy and exercises healthy.\n\nBut when she spilled a cup of water on the floor today (by complete accident!), my mom started just screaming at her. And like most ~~manipulative~~ mothers, she just started dropping so much bullshit on her. There was this whole irrelevant spiel about how, when a creep tried to take a picture of my sister's underwear in the bus, my sister should have worn longer pants in the middle of summer. She also threatened my sister with deliberately spilling water onto her computer just to make a point about how my sister shouldn't have spilled water.\n\nThe part that really triggered me is how my mom just suddenly kept nailing on my sister for her weight. I won't state any numbers, but she's right at the generally \"healthy\" BMI and has maintained it like that for her entire high school life. So it just pissed me off so much when my mom just started talking about how she was a pig, or how for her height she should be skinnier, or this, or that. She went so far as to talk about how our paternal grandmother had died from complications from diabetes or something like that, and how if my sister kept eating all her sweets (aka grapes or peaches) she would also die.\n\nThe thing is, I've experienced the same shit ever since I moved back to South Korea. So many people poking my cheeks, or my chin, or my belly, all calling me fat or pig. I'm also short to this day (at least 10cm shorter than any of my peers), and every single day I expect to be compared to someone else. I really want to console my sister or at least try to help, but I really don't know what I could do to even begin helping.\n\nI'm sorry for this rant, but I really want to get this out of my system and none of my friends really get anything about eating disorders (One of my friends told me that if I really wanted to lose weight, I should just eat laxatives or emetics after I ate meals. We're not friends anymore)", "subreddit": "fuckeatingdisorders"}

My goal is to write something that 1) helps people \\[family, friends\\] who don't have EDs understand what treatment and recovery is actually like and the experiences of people going through it, 2) makes people who've experienced it think, \"That's so accurate! Exactly!\"  \n\n\nIt would be impossible to tell a good, interesting, well-written story if I wasn't achieving both of the above. And I would be kinda lame if I didn't do ALL THE RESEARCH. Yeah, I know a whole lot. But I don't pretend to know everything, and I'd be lame if I did.\n\nI know that this might be triggering or just exhausting for some people, so people absolutely have the right to not answer. But if anyone is interested in demystifying and generous enough to share, I would be so, so appreciative!!! I'm definitely sourcing my research from a lot of different places, but it would be a huge mistake not to ask a variety of people who can speak anonymously online.\n\nHere are some things I want to make sure I get right:\n\n**What staff members are there in Residential? What are their duties? How often are they each around/how often do clients interact with them?**  \nI've visited my friend and gotten to know staff during groups, and of course I know a lot from what she tells me, but I still want to make sure I thoroughly know what the treatment team looks like. Therapists, counselors, nutritionists, nurses. There are also people whose roles I don't know at all, but I know they unlock the bathroom for me.  \n*-Who all is on the team? What are their job titles? What all do they do?*\n\n**What does a \"typical\" Residential schedule look like? (Daily, weekly, monthly?)**  \nI know this can vary wildly from Res to Res, but there do seem to be some consistencies (groups, one-on-one therapy, outings, medical stuff, art projects, etc)  \n*-What does a typical day look like? Typical week? Typical month? What's the schedule?*\n\n**What types of groups are there?**  \nI know it's a whole lotta groups -- I know they can often be taking turns reading from a packet and then discussing that topic. I know groups can be themed to different topics.  \n\\-*What are the different kinds of groups? What topics do they cover?*\n\n**If you got this far even just reading, thank you!**  \nI genuinely have so much respect and admiration for people battling EDs. For general health stuff, we think of \"recovery\" as \"taking it easy\" -- like when you break your ankle and stay in bed a while watching Netflix.\n\nBut with EDs, recovery is *going to battle*. It's sword-wielding, monster-slaying, epic quest shit. Recovery is courageous.\n\nAnyway. If I were a moth, I would be a peppered moth.  \nWhat about you?", "subreddit": "EDAnonymous"}

When I was in the hospital they put me on Zyprexa without telling me anything about it. I gained weight surprisingly fast for me and everyone continued encouraging me to eat even when I had passed a healthy weight range. Recently I looked up this medication and it's almost guaranteed to cause Massive weight gain. No one told me this and I guess it's my fault for not looking into it sooner. I just feel cheated and lied to. All this \"progress\" was just due to a pill and I didnt even get to enjoy eating again because the weight came so fast and now it's impossible to loose it. I'm secretly throwing the pill out at night and have begun skipping meals again.

I'm shaking when I'm going to the kitchen and I feel a happiness and I'm giggling to myself. I'm actually giggling and smiling the whole time getting all my food from the fridge and shelves.

And I take the first bite and I actually feel like I'm orgasming and I have that over-exaggerated moan people in movies make when they eat something good, only that I'm not doing it purposely, I am not controlling anything I do.

I am chasing the next high every day, every single day is like that for me.

I don\u2019t think I have an eating disorder but I have some signs that are kinda concerning. To start, my BMI is about 15.9. I\u2019m a teen male and think I am fat, even though everyone says I\u2019m skin and bone, or say I\u2019m skinny. I still think I could be more skinny. Anyways, I eat very little breakfast and lunch, but when I get home from school I binge almost. Like I\u2019ll eat a decent amount of stuff. I typically say is probably eating 0-600 calories for breakfast-lunch, and then after school and dinner is ranges from 600-2000. I just want to be skinnier and think I\u2019m fat. I just don\u2019t eat like a typical anorexic would. Let me know", "subreddit": "eating_disorders"}

I don't do calories or macros (too much food pressure), but I have a Google spreadsheet with columns for breakfast/lunch/snack/dinner. The game changer has been something I saw on Reddit, not sure if it was in this sub or r/loseit... someone recommended adding a column for **\"I didn't eat...\"** to be able to visually see things they said \"no\" to.\n\nSeeing these exceptions to my binge eating add up meant that being able to NOT binge *was possible*. There was an exception to the rule - which before I thought was: \"I can't control myself. I have no control over my binging.\" Now, I can see that every day, I have \\*some\\* control.\n\nSo today, I got 2 mushroom tacos (with candied onion and guac on corn tortilla with a side of beans) from my work cafeteria. Delicious! I wanted to eat both, but after eating one (and some beans) I felt... satisfied. I grabbed a mini to-go box and put it in the fridge for lunch tomorrow.\n\nBeing able to identify hungry vs satisfied vs full is something I'm still learning and I'm happy I was able to win against my BED today!", "subreddit": "BingeEatingDisorder"}

I know that Reddit isn't a doctor/therapist but I could do with some input. I'm very confused as to whether or not I have a problem and whether or not this problem is am eating disorder or disordered eating. \n\nI've had trouble (I think) with food for a few years now but on and off, and this trouble seems to return more viciously but disguised as something else every time. Sometimes I have a lot of trouble with bingeing, sometimes I restrict, sometimes I purge through exercise. My mental symptoms seem to change a lot as well: sometimes I feel crazy guilt after eating, sometimes I panic, sometimes I feel calm but also very driven to get my calorie balance down to a comfortable range (e.g. by skipping a meal or exercising). It can be very competitive too: if I hear other people's stories I feel like mine isn't enough (?) and like I haven't earned any help. I'm also terrified that, if I go to a Dr and it turns out I really am just being dramatic, I'll feel so guilty and like I need to be a better ED patient (?). Idk, it's all a bit weird and all over the place.\n\nWritten out, it sounds very clear but I think the fact that it keeps changing and my symptoms aren't always present at the same time or at all makes me think it's not real. Every so often the reality of my actions hits home and I panic and want to talk to someone. But every time I psyche myself up for this it's like the symptoms lessen or disappear. I feel almost euphoric happiness all of a sudden and guilty for having faked it all and like I'd be stupid to stop now when there's no actual problem. It's like it's backing off only to seduce me back even harder in a few weeks down the line.\n\nThe thing is, it's never become really serious - I've never been diagnosed, never been hospitalised, only occasionally have I been underweight with it and only sometimes do people express their concern. I'd feel like a poser if I got a diagnosis. Recently, I've been restricting and I'm trying to recover at the moment but it's like I've forgotten how. I keep making the same choices and doing the same things but with thoughts in my mind telling me that I've kicked it. Is this genuinely me recovering or just an ED trying to convince me it's no issue?\n\nBasically, there's a lot going on (some of which I haven't mentioned because this is already an essay) and I don't know what is rational and what isn't. Even now, reading back over this, I feel like I'd just be dismissed and that it's not real. I can't tell if I really am just being a drama queen or if that's a sneaky ED just trying to cling on. \n\nThanks in advance for any help given!", "subreddit": "EatingDisorders"}

I\u2019m not okay, very depressed and engaging in the cycle of bping worsens my mental state, which makes me b/p more. As a form of self harm/repent I don\u2019t do things after I b/p, I don\u2019t do my homework, I don\u2019t tidy my room, I don\u2019t wash myself or my clothes and recently I\u2019ve realised that i can\u2019t function in everyday life anymore without thinking \u201cI want to die\u201d. I hate that thought, because I don\u2019t actually want to die, it\u2019s just an intrusive thought that makes me more depressed.\n\nA few months ago I told a close friend what was going on, she was understanding, listened to me and so on. She really helped me, but the thing about being depressed, is that I\u2019ve stopped wanting to leave the house on the weekends, do activities with friends or even just go on a walk; I\u2019ve stopped living. Because of me our friendship has weakened, leaving me feeling abandoned, even though it\u2019s not like that.\n\nA week ago I told my mother, one evening when I was feeling very unstable and turned my moment of weakness into a moment of strength. My mother\u2019s words of wisdom were \u201cat least it\u2019s not anorexia\u201d and \u201cwait, you want to see someone about this?\u201d\n\nHer reaction deeply disappointed me, but she\u2019s looking for specialised therapists for me, so I\u2019ll receive help soon.\n\nI told her I want to be open about my issue and want to tell my little sister about what I\u2019m going through. Something I\u2019ve not managed to do yet, because I\u2019m scared.\n\nIn the meantime I\u2019ve told another friend of mine who is very invested in my mental health, which has really helped me, but at the end of the day, she isn\u2019t my therapist and I don\u2019t want to turn our relationship into one where we only talk about my problems.\n\nI know telling more people will help me get better, but I\u2019m scared that if I tell my all my friends, it will become something akin to \u2018common knowledge\u2019 and I don\u2019t know how to feel about that.\n\nCurrently I\u2019m getting better by tracking my calories, which isn\u2019t ideal, but if I don\u2019t, then I lose my sense of structure and fall into a b/p cycle for a few days. I\u2019m also focusing on improving in the gym, because sport is good for mental health. Because my main lowlights are on weekends when I\u2019m alone, I\u2019ve joined an organisation committee in my school and am not letting myself not do my homework as a strange repent for binging. I\u2019m focusing on keeping my days consistent and structured, because otherwise I feel like I\u2019m in a free fall, the carpet pulled out from under me.\n\nAny advise on how I can further improve my recovery?

And I\u2019m fine. I eat what I want and when. Sometimes I freak out and wanna go overexercise or c&amp;s or restrict hardcore. But I don\u2019t. I have a healthier relationship with food. I still have really bad body dysmorphia but I am trying to stay on the path of body neutrality over forcing body positivity on myself. \n\nI go to the gym, I eat chocolate bars and chips, I eat veggies and almonds, I eat out and i make my own food. I am just doing good and I never thought I would reach this. \n\nI remember crying when I had a little orange cause it made my carbs and calories \u201ctoo high\u201d. I remember starving myself whenever I was going to go on a date or have sex. I remember exercising 4+ hours a day. I remember only ever thinking about food all day. I remember enjoying puking. I remember going out of everyone\u2019s sight to spit out food. I remember blaming every little thing going wrong in my life on my appearance and thinking restricting what I ate and hating myself along the way was the only thing to do. \n\nI remember joining my ED recovery program and going nope can\u2019t do that and nope WONT do that at the things they suggested. For me my journey started with stopping tracking and deleting my apps. I was overzealously tracking so many things and it took up so much mental space. I also suffered from ED as personality trait syndrome but I want to leave this demon behind forever. ED has done nothing but robbed me of joy over a decade. A little girl in grade 6 shouldn\u2019t have been 150 calories a day and running all the time or circling her body with a black sharpie on what she didn\u2019t like. That just breaks my heart now I see what actual 12 year old children look like when I see my cousins and nieces. ED depleted my muscles, fucked with my liver, probably hurt my fertility, ruined relationships, made me a secretive angry person and so much more damage I will only come to realize with time. \n\nI wish the best for all of you and I know I\u2019m not magically cured and ED brain still pops up for me. It\u2019s a journey. It\u2019s not a linear progression. I could very well relapse.

I'm sorry in advance because this will probably be pretty long\n\nThis \"stash\" was a collection of ziploc bags, diet soda, and cough drops (which I use to soothe my throat after I purge), and also some very personal journals that I kept in the only place I could think of that wasn't suspicious or could be found easily by her. I am a very paranoid and private person and I am suspicious of *everyone* so I hide all my stuff. This stash was tucked away in the corner of my room, in the bottom level of a bookshelf. I created a cavity there by stacking books around a particular corner inside the bookshelf and leaving a space, where I hid my things. That very bottom part of my bookshelf is also hard to access because the space between it and the side of my bed is pretty narrow. Like I said, it was the ONLY place I felt that my stuff was truly secure and wouldn't be found.\n\nWell today my mom was cleaning while I was out, and since there have been fleas in the house for the past week, she was really cleaning EVERYTHING. She ended up clearing away the books and bottom layer of the bookshelf, and all my stuff is gone. I've been home for several hours and just found out, so she is either avoiding talking to me about it or is going to pull it on me later, because she has been talking to me all dandy ever since I got home.\n\nI know she suspects I have eating issues, but I truly believe that she would never admit to herself (if she found out) that I have an *eating disorder*. For reference, she doesn't even believe I have depression (of which I've been diagnosed by two professionals). She knows for a FACT that I have a history of \"throwing up\" but she has no idea about the scale of the problem, and lately she has been asking so many questions about what I ate, how I made it, what I put in it, how much of it I made, the protein content, etc. with this air of innocence and genuine curiosity that creeps me out.

I never skipped meals or food groups, I ate quite a lot, didn't really exercise, and couldn't care less about calories or diets or whatever. Basically I was the poster child of intuitive eating, and probably what most ED sufferers aspire to become.\n\nThen I became sick with the ED, and hell started. I lost weight, regained weight, lost it again, binged, purged, overxercised and all that shit.\n\nRight now I am a bit underweight but I know it won't last long because every time I dip below a certain weight I get uncontrollable and violent binge urges.\n\nIn my previous recovery attempts I did get back to a minimally healthy weight but I never properly got back to my pre-ED weight - I always veeeeery carefully stayed just those couple kilos below that because I was so scared. I was at a healthy weight, approaching my pre-ED weight, yet the hunger wasn't subsiding and I was still getting urges to binge and thoughts about food and all that stuff.\n\nThese days, on top of the restriction, severe purging is quickly becoming a relevant feature of my ED and I realize that I can't keep on doing this to myself. As long as it was just restriction I could get away with it, but purging is way more physically damaging - even a few months of purging can lead to irreparable damage to your teeth, esophagus, heart and so on.\n\nMy question therefore is: if I do actually, properly, for-real-this-time try to recover, can I expect to go back to my pre-ED weight? Because I keep reading people who state that you can never be recovered and maintain a low BMI at the same time, and that you need to overshoot your previous weight unless you want to relapse right away.\n\nSo basically my options seem to be either destroy my health, or get fat (which I will do anyways - binges are real).

A couple of years ago things suddenly started to get much better in many ways when she started a college course and found that living and thriving in life in other ways allowed her to let go of some of her restrictions around food. It's been such a wonderful relief. Before that she had spent years not doing very much having left school at 15 and only ever staying in jobs for short periods of time. During that time, we were trying to make progress with her ED with therapists and support groups. It is incredible how finding something she enjoyed in life had such a greater effect on her making progress with her ED than any quantity of therapy seemed to be able to when she was otherwise disengaged.\u00a0\n\n\nFastforward to now: I am concerned because she has started to lose weight again rapidly in the past few months. She won't tell me she is doing it, but I know she has started running or going to the gym at least everyday, sometimes more. She still eats limited quantities and varieties of food, including no carbohydrates and, as she loses weight, all I can see is that she is damanging herself again. She is much lower energy, sleeping a lot more like she used to and I know that doing exercise, cardio in particular can only be causing her body more harm than good, and I worry about her mental health as this may be the start of developing a new obsessive habit. I know that she wants to be 'fit and healthy' and I think she thinks it is doing her good. Sometimes she will open up and talk with me honestly, but she gets very evasive when I ask about her exercising. Generally she is open to listen learn improve if presented with good info and the right approach from me - which I only sometimes get right.\u00a0\n\n\nQuestions:\n\n1. Is this harmful for her or am I overreacting? If so, how so exactly?\n\n2. Where can I read more about how to safely and healthily introduce exercise with ED recovery? Also about the effects of excercise when you do not have sufficient energy and nutrient intake.\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0It is tricky because:\n\n1. Quite a lot of our family and friends are sporty, runners in particular so often conversations about activeness and related wellbeing come up. It's difficult to also emphasise, the benefits come along with a well balanced diet so may actually not be universally beneficial.\u00a0\n\n2. As she left school early, she was never taught the basic biochem of food, nutrition, exercise fundamentals. I think that she lacks knowledge about how this whole system works.\u00a0\n\n3. We would likely need to get professional advice privately, which she/I am currently not willing/able to afford.\u00a0\n\n\nAny help with the questions above, recommended reading, general advice on how to approach this or any similar positive experience with similar situations would be very welcome.\u00a0\n\n\nThank you.\u00a0", "subreddit": "EatingDisorders"}

I don\u2019t strictly count calories, but usually consume ~1300-1600 a day, which is a very rough approximation due to the fact that i eat out regularly, don\u2019t weigh my food, and graze of handfuls of random food throughout the day that i don\u2019t count. besides walking, i don\u2019t really exercise, because i honestly don\u2019t have the energy and it kinda hurts my bones/joints. \n\ni\u2019m very social and spend time with friends every day, and usually eat with them too. i honestly feel like i eat a normal amount of food\u2014at least for someone a foot shorter than me. nothing is really off-limits to be honest, and i eat big meals too (for example, i had an entire chipotle burrito last night\u2014with guac).  it\u2019s been super easy for me to maintain this weight through slow eating (usually spending an hour eating each meal; with friends, i usually eat half the meal, say i\u2019m full and finish the rest at home because i\u2019m SUCH a slow eater and i\u2019d rather have them think i don\u2019t eat a lot than lose out on enjoying my food). due to my height, i feel like i need to eat even MORE to maintain a healthy weight, which begins around 150 pounds for someone my height. however, i used to be this weight (as i previously mentioned) and was extremely miserable and cried all the time about how i looked. mentally, i was an absolute wreck. \n\nright now, i don\u2019t really have many complications at this weight. maybe it\u2019s because i haven\u2019t been at this weight for a very long time, but i\u2019ve only experienced leg/knee pain off-and-on and coldness and dizziness. my periods are very regular. the main thing i\u2019ve noticed is that i\u2019m never super satiated, like my stomach can be very bloated and full after eating a big &amp; balanced meal but i still want more sometimes. but for the most part i\u2019m fine. \n\ni honestly feel like my body is adapting to it\u2019s current weight. i\u2019m physically full most of the time and have never been more social and relaxed about food. i eat large portions of mostly whole, plant-based foods and RARELY empty calories, and do not rely on diet soda/coffee/tea to fill me up. i do not overexercise in the slightest. \n\nis it possible to be healthy at an underweight BMI of 15.8-16ish? please let me know your questions/comments below. i am seeing the doctor on thursday and want to be open with them about my concerns as well and see if this is a possibility.", "subreddit": "EDAnonymous"}

I'm visiting my alma mater to see my friends for my birthday weekend, and so I made some time to go see him. He knows I'm going through a lot with my romantic relationship, and he's become worried about me over time with my stress levels. He knows about my struggles with my eating disorder as well as my auto immune condition. \n\nHowever, when I saw him last night, after spending 20 minutes with me, Mike thought it would be appropriate to ask me **\"How much have you been eating??? You look BIG. I know I'd want someone to tell me.\" He goes on for a while about how worried he is about me.** I had to leave immediately after that because I was so hurt, I could barely keep from crying. As soon as I got home, I threw up just from how angry and sad I was.\n\nI spent the night crying, and tried to text him to tell him how much that hurt, and how incredibly triggering it was for me, but he just ended up getting mad and telling me that he was purely \"concerned about my health and happiness\" and that he would \"ignore the red flags from now on.\" He has always thought I was \"too thick for his preference\" and has told me multiple times, and he even specifically told me that he doesn't like \"girls with big butts\". Keep in mind, this is a platonic friend. \n\nAfter this specific event, I've been told to talk to him and explain how hurtful it was, but I already did that over text and he just kept talking about my \"health.\" Funny because my senior spring semester, the last time Mike saw me, I was eating once a day (maybe) and was near the lowest I'd ever weighed. I had started to gain weight again at the end of the semester, but for a while I weighed less than I did in middle school. \n\nFor reference, I don't weigh myself because I don\u2019t want to fixate on numbers (a part of my recovery), but I can usually tell based on how I feel and how my clothes fit. Now when he last saw me, I was a size 6. I have since gained about 10-15 pounds ( I think) and wear a size 8. I assure you I am healthier now than I was then, considering I am now actually eating food and not starving myself. \n\nI am reeling from the impact of this, and I can barely look myself in the mirror, and I don't know if I can ever look at him the same again. *Any advice or support would be appreciated.*", "subreddit": "EDAnonymous"}

Of the four people who I have told in the past five years, most of them don't believe that it's a real problem since \"only girls are anorexic.\" They insist I'm just stressed or don't have a good appetite. For that reason and many more, I have not shared this with anyone new in four years.\nUntil yesterday.\nI've been falling for a girl (first time in years--basically since my ED took my freedom, libido, and trust in my own emotions from me), and we've been in that amazing stage of moving from small talk flirting to really getting to know each other. We both are really into running together, and I enjoy running with her because it isn't about speed or tracking calories. Together, we just do it for the runners' high and to clear our heads and admire the scenery around us. I told her that I often run for the wrong reasons on my own, and I could tell she truly cared when she asked me if I would be comfortable talking about what I meant. It led to an incredible conversation and many discoveries for both of us as we discussed the disorder (she has a history with anorexia as well, which I did not know before but I had suspected in subtle ways). I also told her I didn't want this to change anything between us because I love eating meals with her--the thoughts of calories and guilt are kept at bay by my happiness when we go out for lunch together. She isn't a crutch in my life, but she helps bring out the side of me that I love and haven't known for some time.\nI'm not sure why I'm sharing this, but I think I have just always been so afraid of sharing this side of me with people who I know care enough about me to try and help. I thought that it would somehow undo my identity. But I did it. And guess what? THE WORLD DIDN'T END! I feel so free and proud!

In theory, I should feel guilt-free about eating foods like this because the snack foods I typically eat are usually prepackaged into single-serving sizes with included nutritional information or I meticulously pre-portion servings myself from larger packages. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm totally baffled by why I feel such immense guilt from eating foods that have never been fear foods for me in the past solely because they can be categorized as \"snack foods.\" I'm really annoyed about the whole situation because it's not like I need another restrictive food rule to add to my list!

Just turned 37 years old and I have battled with my weight and food for years. \nIn my single days, when no one but maybe a roommate would be around, I'd sneak my multiple drive thru purchases into my room before anyone noticed. That's when I could wait until I got home to eat. Other times I'd stop in the nearest parking lot and shove everything in as fast as I could.\nI'd go to Krispy Kreme and order extra napkins so maybe, just maybe, the cashier didn't suspect they were all for me. If I ordered multiple drinks, I would say \"I want a Coke and they want (insert sugary drink here) to make it look like the entire order wasn't for me. \nI'd go on bouts if clean eating, drinking healthy smoothies. I'd lose 25 lbs, go back to my old ways and gain it all back.\nCue marriage. I married another overweight person. We love food. We eat out a lot and it shows. When I married I weighted about 280. I'm now at about 320.\nI'm the heaviest I have ever been. I have high blood pressure, high cholesterol, inflammation issues, Hashimoto's thyroiditis and most recently, full blown diabetes. I have depression and anxiety that I have battled since high school. Everything hurts. Every step is a chore. And although I've always been overweight by any doctor's standards, I never walked like a fat person, or so I was told. Now I do. I waddle and huff and puff. Btw I'm only 5 foot 4 inches tall.\nSo why, after all this time, and all these ailments, have I not been scared into action? It's like the more I have wrong with me, the more I wave the white flag and dig deeper into food and drinks.\nAnd we're not just talking too many Cokes. I'm ashamed to admit that I have recently been ADDING sugar to drinks, mostly Powerade. I take a few big sips and then pour sugar in until it reaches the top and shake shake shake. It's like I cant get enough sugar. I even poured sugar into a regular coke the other day. They obviously dont make a drink sweet enough for me. Last night I even laid in bed and couldn't go to sleep until I went to the kitchen and made my concoction, complete with white bread that I rolled up and dipped into butter. It was the perfect carby snack, washed down with a sweet sweet drink.\nI dont know what to do. I'm obviously on a fast path to destruction health wise. My family doesnt help. They're all enablers. We all enable each other. My husbands doesnt have the secret binges (that I know of) but we all ear guilty of not taking care of ourselves.\nI'm sharing because I feel i have reached the extreme of extremes. Anyone else feel like they're last the point of no return?\nI love my family doctor but each visit yields bloodwork that keeps getting worse. I don't want her to just throw her hands up because I have no self control. \nCounseling doesnt work either. I've already been down that path with depression and I just tell them what they want to hear and never change my ways. \nThoughts?", "subreddit": "FoodAddiction"}

Just that they want to avoid dealing with it all, as if it was all that hard on them. When they weren\u2019t even involved in the first place. \n\nI just miss it. I\u2019m growing bitter. I\u2019ve gained so much weight and feel like I\u2019ve lost so much of myself. Which is a bit of a pity, right? That I held so much of my identity onto having an eating disorder? I can\u2019t even recognize myself in the mirror anymore. I look like a ridiculous caricature of what I used to be. Bloated, squishy, disgusting.

Everyone irl who \u201csupports\u201d me is exhausted with my back-and-forth between committing to being \u201chealthy\u201d and struggling to lose weight without tumbling down the ED hole. So I can\u2019t open up about it anymore. This shit doesn\u2019t just \u201cgo away\u201d, but they sit there and tell me I should be done with it, that I\u2019m being dramatic and making my own problems. That I\u2019m puppeting that voice in the back of my head telling me to embrace that sickness all on my own. I mean, obviously, how could I still have an ED if I was able to eat so much at dinner last night without batting an eye? Look at how far I\u2019ve come, eating entire meals! They act as if binging isn\u2019t a thing. As if I don\u2019t sit there feeling like garbage, like a human trashcan, inhaling food without tasting it just to eat and Be A Human Without Weird Brainstuff. I can\u2019t even purge because they know about that, too, and question when I take more than 5 minutes on the toilet. Almost like it\u2019s a joke. \u201cHa-ha, did all that pizza make you sick?\u201d When it did. I just couldn\u2019t get it out of my system properly because everyone is judging me, staring holes into my stomach, making sure every pound and calorie of food is still in there. And then they point and say, \u201csee? That\u2019s proof that you don\u2019t have an eating disorder!\u201d While I rip myself to pieces mentally because I\u2019m so much *better* than all of that. I\u2019m better than this. I could go days without eating, just give me a protein shake and about a dozen Red Bulls and I can survive happily. I could embrace that hunger and skate through days without even remembering them. Now I get comments when I reach for *more* food, *another* cookie. Life is a joke. \n\nNon-SO doesn\u2019t want me having peach anymore and is still suspicious when I\u2019m on reddit. He doesn\u2019t want me finding encouragement or positivity towards losing weight the way I want (re: the only way I know) because even if it\u2019s support in these communities, it also feeds into that ED mindset. Which isn\u2019t untrue. It\u2019s actually reasonable, when I think about it, to essentially ban me or people like me from those things or even remove the ProED community completely as reddit did. \n\nBut I don\u2019t necessarily give a shit and want it all back. If I want to bask in unhealthy shit, let me. I\u2019m not a child. I\u2019m not an idiot.

I developed and my hips were very curvy in a time where being rail thin was in. I thought being a size 0 was the best when I was in a size 7/9, 130 lbs at 5'7 (I was healthy and looked good but never saw it). I started starving myself and would never lose a jean size. I would then binge and eat everything. This cycle would continue for years and my weight only fluctuated by 10 lbs. The only relationship I had with food was to eat everything in sight or eat nothing at all.\n\nFast forward to my late 20s and my metabolism slowed down and it was harder to maintain the weight. I gained 80lbs. I had dreams about eating. The feeling I got from food, the complete comfort it gave. I would spend hours at work planning what I would eat when I got home. I will eat whole bags of chips, candy, ice cream, whole pizzas, pasta, you name it. I HAD to finish whatever I was eating, even if it made me sick. I would always hide my eating of course. Always eating alone in my room. Throwing the wrappers and containers in the bottom if the trash bin and hiding things over it.\n\nI would go on diets but got so overboard and restrictive I became obessed with CICO and how healthy everything was and how much I was working out. It is impossible to keep that up so I would spiral and go into binge eating again. The cycle is vicious.\n\nI found keto and it changed my life. I have lost over 30 lbs so far. I still have binge and addiction issues but am working on my relationship with food. Moderation is a word I am trying to learn. That food is not evil or a best friend. It is just food.\n\nIt is a long road and as I am typing this I am fighting cravings to go out and stuff my face, but I won't because it won't make me happy and the comfort it gives is false.\n\nAnyway, thank you for letting me vent here and I hope all of you have a good day :)", "subreddit": "FoodAddiction"}

I gained over 100lbs over 3 years. That was 5 years ago. So for 2 years, I have maintained my fatness.\n\nLooking back, I've always been a binge eater, I just used to overexercise and severely restrict to maintain my 5'9\" 170lbs figure.\n\nA typical day for me was taking Garcinia Cambogia and Hydroxycut, no breakfast, pack of Starbursts for lunch, grapes and tuna at 4 pm, and then bingeing on cookies, candy, pints of ice cream, etc. till the cows came home. I would then wake up 6 am do an Insanity style workout, walk everywhere, and go to the gym when I got home.\n\nI looked and seemed normal and healthy to people though the above description is clearly disordered eating.\n\nFor as long as I can remember, I've always been obsessed with sugar. In my skinny days, I knew I couldn't eat all that stuff and still be fit/thin so I opted for starvation/exercise and then binged on \" the good stuff\"\n\nHowever, it all fell apart one Fall (hah didn't mean for the triple entendre, referring to the season) when I broke my foot. Before that, I was actually prepping for a fitness competition and was obsessively trying to lose the last 15lbs. I became very depressed when I was bedridden and in severe pain from my injury. I was in a cast and then a boot for 6 months and even after that walking was very painful. All this time I was still bingeing like I used to but didn't have the correction method to reign it in.\n\nI mainly binge eat sweet foods. Sure, I can occasionally devour a bag of Doritos, but who doesn't? For the most part, anything salty or savory, I can control myself around, I can even keep it in the house and forget it's there. I can eat \"clean\" and healthy all day. I quite enjoy healthy food options like salads, quinoa, veggies, I don't like rice that much unless I'm eating Indian or something like that. I can go without pasta for a long time.\n\nIt's the sugar stuff that I can't seem to shake. There's no such thing as too sweet. There was a period where I was just eating Nutella out of the jar. Or baking half a pack of tollhouse cookies and putting Nutella on them with ice cream.. mmm. (sorry for the trigger)\n\nI'm at the point where I've done a lot of work to get to the bottom of this. I have not gained any weight in the last 2 years but because I still binge sweets at the end of the day, I cannot lose weight.\n\nFor the brief periods that I stop bingeing I can lose 20lbs. That lasts about 3 weeks and I eventually break down and want some sweet sugary goodness! Ice cream and candy are my two biggest ones. Even if I don't keep it in the house, I will get in my car and go buy it because I'm literally not able to sleep or stop thinking about it. Is this what heroin addiction feels like?\n\nI have a history of depression, but besides that, I feel like I just binge because I love food and it just tastes soo good.\n\nI had a friend who found eating annoying.

I want to make clear that different programs have different exchanges and if you received exchanges from a treatment program that are different, please follow those because that is designed for you, but this is based on the one that my program uses, and I\u2019ve found it to be very helpful.\n\nThe way that you'd create this meal plan for yourself is by calculating the number of calories that you need in a day to fully nourish yourself and then putting together exchanges to meet that caloric goal. There is a range of calories that goes into each exchange (So 1 tsp of oil and 1 tbsp of nut butter are both 1 fat exchange, despite the caloric difference, but there are also several that are lower than the projected number of calories, so as long as you eat a variety of foods, it should all even out).\n\nA meal plan made up with nutritional exchanges is based on four groups:\n\nSTARCH - 80 calories, 15g carbs. This would include \\[All measured cooked\\]: 1/2 cup rice, 1/2 cup pasta, 1 slice of bread, 1/2 burger bun, 1/2 cup corn, 1/2 cup peas, 1 small potato (white) or 1/2 large potato (russet), 3/4 cup cereal, 1/2 cup oatmeal, 1/2 pita, 1 small tortilla or 1/2 large tortilla, 1 pancake, 1 eggo waffle, 1/2 large belgian waffle,1/2 bagel, 1 english muffin, 1 cup pretzels or 2 pretzel rods, 8 animal crackers, 6 saltines or ritz crackers, 3 squares of graham crackers, 1 tbsp maple syrup, 1/8 cup granola\n\nPROTEIN - 75 calories, 7g protein. This would include \\[all measured as cooked\\]: 1/2 cup beans, 1/2 cup tofu, 1/4 cup meat, 1 slice deli meat, 1 egg, 1 cup yogurt, 3/4 cup greek yogurt, 1 cheese stick, 1 cup milk, 1/4 cup cheese, 1/4 cup cottage cheese, 1 hot dog, 1/2 meat burger patty, 1 vegetarian burger patty\n\nFAT - 45 calories, 5g fat. This would include 1 tsp butter/oil/margarine, 1 tbsp pesto, 1 tbsp salad dressing, 1 tbsp nut butter or nutella, 2 tbsp hummus, 3 tbsp guacamole, 1/4 avocado, 8 olives, 1 tbsp whole nuts, 2 tbsp sliced/chopped nuts, 1 tbsp mayonnaise\n\nFRUIT - 60 calories, 15g carbohydrates - This would include 1 banana, 1 apple, 1 peach, 1 orange, 2 clementines, 2 plums, 1/2 grapefruit, 3/4 cup berries, 1 cup chopped melon, 1/2 cup cooked vegetables, 1 cup raw vegetables, 1 cup fruit juice\n\nThere's also combination foods, including: 1 cup chips other than pita (1 starch, 1 fat), 1 cup pita chips (2 starch, 1 fat), 1/2 cup ice cream (1 starch, 1 fat), 3/4 cup sorbet/frozen yogurt (1 starch, 1 fat), 1 granola bar (1 starch, 1 fat), 1/3 cup trail mix (2 starch, 1 fat), 3 slices bacon (1 protein, 1 fat), 1/3 cup hummus (1 protein, 1 fat), 2 tbsp nut butter (1 protein, 1 fat), 10 steak-cut french fries (1 starch, 1 fat), 1 cup casserole (2 starch, 2 protein), 1 cup stew (1 starch, 1 protein, 1 fat), 1 burrito (3 starch, 1 protein, 2 fat), 1 slice pizza (2 starch, 1-3 proteins depending on toppings, 1 fruit), 1 cup whole milk (1 protein, 1 fat), 1 package ramen (2 starch, 2 fat), 1 cup chex mix (2 starch, 1 fat), 1/2 cup goldfish (1 starch, 1 fat)\n\nAnd food that just counts as an extra, it doesn't count towards any of the existing exchanges: Vinegar, pickles, ketchup, mustard, hot sauce, any seasoning like salt, garlic, lemon juice, soy sauce, taco sauce, bouillon, club soda, coffee, sugar-free drink mixes, tea.\n\nThere is also a caloric beverage exchange. It\u2019s 8oz of any caloric drink (i.e., Juice, lemonade, gatorade, powerade, milk, soy milk, coconut milk, oat milk, regular soda), and for the sake of calculating towards your caloric goal, it\u2019s equivalent to 100 calories. Water, anything with artificial sweeteners, and almond milk don\u2019t count.\n\nWhen you create your meal plan, you want to have at least one of every exchange at each meal (3 meals a day) and at least two exchanges which are different from one another at each snack (3-5 snacks a day).\u00a0\n\nFor example, my meal plan is:\n\n* When I wake up: 1 caloric beverage\n* Breakfast: 2 starch, 1 protein, 1 fat, 1 fruit, 1 caloric beverage\n* Snack: 2 starch, 1 fat, 2 caloric beverage\n* Lunch: 2 starch, 3 protein, 1 fat, 1 fruit, 1 caloric beverage\n* Snack: 1 starch, 1 fat, 2 caloric beverage\n* Dinner: 3 starch, 3 protein, 2 fat, 1 fruit, 1 caloric beverage\n* Snack: 1 starch, 1 fat, 2 caloric beverage\n\nWhich could look like:\n\n* When I wake up: 8oz gatorade\n* Breakfast: 1.5 cups oatmeal, 2 tbsp sliced almonds, 1 egg, 1 apple, 8oz gatorade\n* Snack: 1 cup chex mix, 16oz gatorade\n* Lunch: 1 cup rice, 1/2 cup chicken, 1/2 cup edamame, 1 tbsp salad dressing, 1/2 cup mixed vegetables, 8oz gatorade\n* Snack: 1 granola bar, 8oz gatorade\n* Dinner: 1 pita, 1 tbsp pesto, 1/2 cup vegan cheese, 1/4 cup chicken, 1/2 cup ice cream with 3/4 cup berries, 8oz apple juice\n* Snack: 1/2 cup goldfish, 8oz gatorade\n\nAnd that\u2019d meet 100% of my exchanges.\u00a0Pretty typical for when I was in residential actually.\n\nIf you have any questions, I\u2019ve been on this sort of meal plan for a while so I know the exchanges for tons of shit.", "subreddit": "EDAnonymous"}

I\u2019ve finally gained the weight needed to put me just above underweight on the BMI scale, meaning I\u2019m technically healthy!! I still have lots to go in terms of mental health but I\u2019m so proud of myself for the physical aspect of recovery. I never thought I would be able to do it, I thought I would find it easier to die than to gain weight, so for months of recovery I only gained less than 1kg. In two months I managed to gain 4 times that! This might be really hard for people to read if the idea gaining weight is a terrifying as it was to me a few months back, but I just wanted to let everyone know that whilst it\u2019s not my favourite thing in the world, I can think about it in a positive light and it doesn\u2019t feel like the world is ending. \n\nThe problem I\u2019m having now is that my body dysmorphia is playing up, and even though if I were to lose 2lbs I would be underweight again, i see myself as relatively large in the mirror. I guess it\u2019s just a big change from how small I was before. I\u2019m trying to make sustainable healthy changes to my lifestyle to appreciate my body more to combat this. I got the go ahead from my psychologist/dietician to rejoin a gym, which I\u2019ve been waiting for for ages. I have to put a lot of effort to not overdo it with the exercise but I\u2019m doing well now and my progress has lead me to believe I can do even better. \n\nSorry if this isn\u2019t what people wanted to hear, at my lowest point i didn\u2019t even consider recovery as an option. I just want everyone to remember that it always is. It\u2019s so satisfying now to have a level of control over a disease that took so much away from me, including relationships I\u2019ll never be able to mend.

Hell, I baked for the first time in four years the other day and ate some family recipes. I didn't really care - I just ate. It was a good day, I even had some chocolates, dinner, lunch and a snack.\n\nToday, I ate two pieces of chocolate and I feel like I'm dying. I can't forget the numbers of calories in them, even if I try my best to ignore that calorie calculator in my head. 16 calories in each chocolate, I ate two. I had some gummies earlier. And my lunch. I'm having rice with my dinner, that's even worse!\n\nI want my brain to shut off. I want to rip every piece of skin off of my body. It's so grateful to eat, to have nutrients. The joy I experience when I'm able to go to the bathroom without the aide of laxatives or metamucil is indescribable. I don't fear taking the train home because \"what if I pass out and end up in another state?\"\n\nBut I am genuinely disgusted to myself to my very core. I loved myself more when I was skin and bones, it was a comfort. What am I now without my ribs poking out? Well, me, of course - just grossed out.\n\nMy family is so proud of me. My friends are so proud of me. Everyone is standing behind me cheering me on to beat anorexia - I truly, wholeheartedly believe I would be dead right now had my sister not pulled me aside and threatened to cut contact with me if I did not start eating again.\n\nI can't say I care about whether I live or I die. I'm by no means suicidal, but I was in love with being skinny. But I love my sister more, as well as my mother, and I care about staying in contact with them.\n\nI hope tomorrow is a good day where I can eat my snacks and enjoy them too. Tonight will be a struggle - stir fry and a slice of cake for dessert. But I'll keep trying. I can't give up.\n\nI know it - I was miserable in the midst of my chronic eating disorder. I just can't tell yet.

It's gross but I don't have to sit for hours on the toilet in extreme pain or with heaps of laxatives. That's fantastic!\n2. I can eat a snack offered to me by a friend and still have lunch/dinner/whatever later. I don't have to make up some far-fetched excuse as to why I can't eat a slice of apple or eat it and then not eat dinner for two days.\n3. I don't have sunken in cheeks. I used to love my sunken in cheeks, because it was a reward for not eating. Look how skinny you are! But now they're leaving. It's a sign I'm winning. That, and the loss of my thigh gap (getting there!)\n4. People at university talk to me more. My sister told me food brings people together, she was right. I've made a friend with a guy in my lectures who likes to bring unique snacks or treats he bakes - so I've started doing it too. We exchange them and get along really well.\n5. I'm not passing out anymore. My heart doesn't ache. My bones don't creak. I rarely ever see stars.\n6. Bad lunch? Don't have a meltdown. That's not the only meal you're having today, you'll still have dinner. You can still have an enjoyable food experience (I used to break down if I had a bad dinner because I would eat one thing a day).\n7. Exploring new foods! No more staring at cool new snacks on the TV and wishing I could have them. What's stopping me? Anorexia. So let's go out and buy the snacks to show anorexia who's boss. Did you know they made smoothie-flavoured gummies? I bought them today, they're great.

But I swear, I'm being real and I'm ashamed of it.\n\nSo I recently admitted to myself that my eating is highly restrictive, disordered, and that I have essentially myself with an eating disorder. And I realized that I am dysphoric (I might be nonbinary, but that's a whole lotta different story, just for context, I hate my \u201cfemale shape\u201c, except for two or three typically feminine features). So that's great. (it's not. )\nSo I came across that godforsaken video, produced by fat activist (??) Virgie Tovar; \u201cTake the cake\u201c is what it's called I think.\nBasically, it's about how we should take the piece that's offered to us or refuse it, instead of causing the person cutting the cake any more effort (like cutting a smaller piece), saying that whoever publicly asks for a smaller slice was being selfish and just trying to signal that they are \u201cgood\u201c. It also included satirical enactments of such situations.\nThis triggered my food anxiety HORRIBLY. I know it's just in my head, but now just resorted to never eat anything \u201cbad\u201c in public because this video made me think that people not only judge me for performing healthy choices (as in, not eating, haha, honk honk) but also for not doing this. So I refused everything that I was being offered. That's what Tovar wanted me to do; to not be a massive fucking burden to everyone around me because of my disorder, right?? I'll just salvate silently in a corner over my two litre bottle of water so Virgie Tovar can eat her cake and doesn't have to feel attacked by my Eating Disorder. I want to be supportive of activists like this really bad, but everything about what Tovar stands for, how she articulates it, disgusts me so much, and I feel horrible about it. I don't think people who are thicc, fat, obese, overweight, chunky, or whatever you prefer (!!) should feel bad about their body, or socially pressured into weightloss (even though people should strive to be at a healthy weight, but what am I saying, I'm clowning myself).\nOne of the reasons my eating is fucked is that my family never told me that I was overweight as an early teen (emotional eating), so I thought I was good, until Dysphoria and other stuff in my life hit me hard (hi there ED). \nThe extreme side of fat activism made me cry yesterday, as I came across a blog entry saying that ED recovery rhethoric is fatphobic and has to change. Girl, your movement telling me that diets don't work and that I would \u201cstatistically gain it back in the next five years, but DOUBLE\u201c caused me to relapse (clowning again, I never recovered). \nI just feel awful for it, but I started despising the fat activist rhethoric of being \u201cdoomed\u201c to a certain set point weight, of having no control, being portrayed as some kind of slave to the patriarchy. I don't give a fuck about men, I'm with a girl. \nI just feel like crap for this. I love you, thicc/fat people, I don't judge you. I just really hate Virgie Tovar and her movement to the point that her fake smile makes me sick, and I don't want to think about someone like this. What are your thoughts?

Before I got sick, just like the rest of my life and most of my family members, I used to maintain a pretty low (technically healthy, but still low) BMI without having the slightest issue with food whatsoever, never skipping meals and always eating intuitively.\n\nNow that I am yet again underweight and experiencing a new relapse, with violent and frequent purging quickly becoming a \"staple\" of my ED, I realize that I absolutely have to do something before I damage my health beyond the point of no return. But the fear of weight gain and getting fat is overwhelming.\n\nIn my previous recovery attempts I did get back to a healthy-ish weight, but I never fully 100% restored to my pre-ED weight because I was just so scared. I was already out of the danger zone, my BMI wasn't low anymore and I was approaching my pre-ED weight, yet I was still experiencing extreme hunger so I freaked out.\n\nTherefore: if I do try recovery for real, can I expect to get back to my pre-ED situation, or is it just my ED talking? Is it wishful thinking? Because I see so many people stating that it is unrealistic to maintain a low-ish BMI while recovering from an ED and that you have to get fatter than before because otherwise the thoughts will never go away. Many \"recovery spokepersons\" are embracing the HAES attitude.\n\nAny ideas?\n\n(for context: I am a male, so no shifts in weight due to periods/pregnancies/whatever).", "subreddit": "EatingDisorders"}

About a year ago I used to frequently visit pro Ana websites. First it was out of morbid curiosity, then I just kept going to them, probably about daily. Despite how I was underweight, I started to use some of the \"tips\" on there (won't go into them)\n\nI started working out more and more, and would always try to limit my food intake. I would look in the mirror and criticize my body, sometimes crying for hours after. The only reason I question if I actually had an eating disorder is that I never counted calories or purged or anything really extreme. I would usually cave after trying not to eat the whole day, didn't really weigh myself and after a few months I think I straightened myself out. \n\nI'm now making an effort to gain weight and I am trying to get out of the habit of just not eating when I don't want to. Though visiting pro Ana communities or seeing anything about them kind of triggers me in a way and it gives me the urge to revert back to what I used to do. About once every few months I admit I visit them.\n\nI just don't know. How could I \"recover\" so quickly if I really had an Ed?

I've been doing it on and off for 4 years and have never told anyone, not the four therapists I've seen, nor my husband, who otherwise knows a lot about my ED struggles. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSome days going out to buy snacks to c/s is the only time I leave the house (I work from home and am also depressed AF) so I kind of even think of it as a good thing because at least it's motivation to go outside. For example, right now I am in an internal debate as to whether to get dressed to go buy some cookies to c/s or if I should stay in my pajamas the rest of the day. So I'm going to write out this list of reasons not to c/s. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\- It's a waste of money. I am pretty frugal in most areas of my life but I spend all this money on food that I don't even get calories from. And to be honest I don't even get the enjoyment of eating out of the food I c/s because I feel guilty doing it. \n\n\\- It's unclear how many calories are absorbed from it. I've read everything from \"negligible\" to 10%. Digestion does begin in the mouth and since I tend to c/s starchy foods (mostly stuff like cookie sand bread), the sugar breakdown definitely starts there. Maybe it is actually \"negligble\" but considering I weigh/log everything else I eat down to the last gram, leaving a possible margin of 10% as \"unknown\" is kind of a lot and counter to all the other work I put in. \n\n\\- Supposedly it stimulates your body to release insulin in preparation for digestion which is bad for you. \n\n\\- I'm starting to get some tooth/gum sensitivity which I think is from a combination of c/s and a shit ton of chewing gum. Way too embarassed to go to the dentist over it, so I'm going to attempt to give myself a break from c/s and see if the sensitivity improves. \n\n\\- I haven't found anything online about this, but I have to imagine the sugar is bad for my teeth. \n\n\\- Having to find somewhere to dispose of it discreetly is a pain in the ass. I usually do either plastic bottles or bags which means I can't recycle those items (which goes against my pro-environment instincts) and then I find somewhere to throw them out so my husband doesn't see them in the garbage. Or I will flush it down the toilet, and I'm pretty sure the residue has been making my toilet get gross in weird ways (black spots). \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMost importantly... if I'm going to be honest with myself c/s is just a distraction from everything else in my life that I'm trying to avoid confronting. So maybe stopping this will force me to get some better/healthier coping mechanisms OR... maybe even.... confront those things (lol okay probably not but it's a step). \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnyway... putting this out there partly as an accountability mechanism for myself and also partly so I can come look at it again when I'm inevitably tempted in the future.

She said I need to get on track and by the way I explained everything, the first thing she wants to try is to moderate the moderating I try to do. So I guess starting today, no more soda!

Getting healthy &amp; fit without relapsing", "author": "EDPostRequests", "self_text": "I have a history of restrictive eating, and was diagnosed with EDNOS a few years back. It's something that comes and goes episodically for me, with relapses typically caused by various triggers in my life as well as influenced by my depression, low self esteem, and body image/dysmorphia issues. Typically in the past I've gone several months or even a year or more between relapses.\n\nRecently due to hormonal changes (entering my 20's, birth control, etc) I've gained quite a bit of weight, to the point of being medically overweight although not obese. I have a desire to take up exercising and more healthy eating, not just for appearance reasons, but also to have a healthier body and mind. I would like to have less body fat, more muscle mass, and more stamina and ability when doing sports/exercise, like running, biking, hiking, etc. I don't enjoy the limits my increased weight has put on me, from a funcionality perspective. I also think that healthier habits may positively impact my mental health overall.\n\nI won't lie and say that changing my appearance and my unhappiness about looking overweight aren't motivations at all, though. And in the past when I've tried to eat healthier for the sake of weight loss/improving my appearance, I've accidentally fallen back into my old habits. \"Not eating when I'm not hungry (as in due to boredom or negative emotion)\" becomes \"I won't eat until I'm literally starving because I don't really NEED or deserve it until then\". I then end up even less healthy and feel physically like shit all the time.\n\nI'm wondering if any of you have advice on how to actually become healthier while avoiding the trap of restricting my diet to extreme degrees. The last thing I want to do is relapse again, but sometimes the disordered part of my brain has different ideas. Any input is appreciated!", "subreddit": "EatingDisorders"}

I'm seeing a psychiatrist for my problem, and so far we think it maybe for affective reasons. I began binging when I was with my ex boyfriend but it was near the end of our relationship. For example for dinner he would buy pizza, me a salad. At night I would eat the rest of his pizza. I slept with my parents or sister until I was 14-15 (yep, that old). Then I was always in a relationship. The type of girl that finds someone new 2 days after a breakup (I dont do well alone). Now I'm beating my single record, a year and 3 months I think. I'm in a wheelchair now, harder to date and trying to feel good alone. \nThing is I only binge at night. During the day I never binge. But as soon as I wake up, I just feel the urge to eat, many times a night. Its crazy the amount of food I can eat in one night... My friends dont take my problem seriously because I am not fat, But I work out a lot. I keep eating my roomate's food, he says he doesnt mind but I do.\nThere are so many things I had to stop buying... Peanut butter, Jelly, even butter because I could eat 8 slices of bread per night. Bananas, ate 7 once, was out for the weak. One night, I ate my 16 individuals yugurt, so I was out for the whole week. No more cereal either, could eat the whole box in one night. Also opened a new ice cream package from my roomate and finish it. One night, there was nothing to binge, I found brown sugar and ate some with a spoon. I'm trying to explain to my friends that it is not just gaining weight that scares me. It is not pratical. And doesnt help my insomnia either. I always cook my dinners for the week on Sunday. Had to store them at my aunt's because I was eating my dinners at night (my aunt live in the same building). \nAnybody here who only binge at night?", "subreddit": "BingeEatingDisorder"}

I can't even sit still anymore because I incorporate expending energy into everything I do. I play guitar standing up, I cook long meals (that I don't even eat) to move more, I park on the far end of the parking lot at school. I can't even focus anymore because I can't sleep. I can't sleep because I'm procrastinating. I have so much unfinished projects and homework which causes me to stay up even longer. It's a reckless cycle. \n\nAnyway\n\nI hope I don't come off as rude. I just intend to share my honest perception here because there's nowhere else I can.\n\nMost of you probably know about her, but I've followed this Youtuber Eugenia Cooney since middle school and watching her makes me feel like complete **garbage**. Now I compare myself to her all the time and I want to be as skinny as her. She's one of my many idols (IDK why anymore tbh), most of whom are underweight. I guess I'm considered thin by most people's standards, yet I feel like a fat pig because she **is** my standard of thin. Obviously Eugenia isn't the main reason why I restrict calories, but getting to a bmi of under 15 is one of the things I'm striving for. Do I envy people like Eugenia Cooney? Yes. Which girl wouldn't? She's a deathly skinny yet beautiful wealthy girl living in L.A. with millions of people who care about her and watch her streams, like her photos, and send her gifts, money, clothing, makeup etc.  In every video it's like she's mocking me and flaunting how thin she is and everyone is **always** worried about her. Her face is beautiful, even without makeup. Comparing my life to hers, It's like 2 different realities. I won't deny she's suffering, but I'd take her spot over mine any day.\n\nSince I'm jealous of her I guess the best thing to do would be turning my envy into motivation.\n\nThere's thousands of photos of people I admire from thin musicians to writers to actors on my computer. I tell myself to stop being a disgusting fat pig and be like them. I believe I am fat even though everyone looks at me weird, people say I look like a ghost, and my brother calls me anorexic. I don't care. I will lose more weight. Especially since I fucked up summer and didn't exercise or lose as much weight as I wanted to. It is much easier to lose weight during the fall since my body will burn more calories being cold, I can exercise longer without the suffocating heat, and I can drink more hot tea and coffee.\n\n I feel as if I need to be able to see my ribs and have a wider thigh gap. Hearing my stomach actually makes me happy. I need to feel empty because feeling full of food repulses me. I hate the guilt and shame that results from eating anything other than a fucking rice cake or drinking Monster. Most of my safe foods have actually turned into fear foods now. I can't eat a pickle if I don't have green tea with it. Now that autumn and winter are approaching, I can finally wear tons of layers and hide my disgusting ugly body. I remember when some guys at school asked me out... as a dare/joke. A girl pretended to be my friend just to use me to abuse for fun. And people wonder why I'm a pathetic recluse with selective mutism, fucking aspergers and probably other disorders probably not even recognized by the DSM-5.\n\nAt least I can hide my self harm scars I gave myself as punishment for all the things I despise about myself. Cutting fucking ruined my arms and legs. I have nothing to lose anymore so might as well take my self destruction to the max. \n\nGetting weird looks at the gym really makes me so uncomfortable and self-conscious. This guy was looking at me funny and kept glancing over at me. Yeah I know I'm already fucking thin and I look dumb struggling on the machines for the 6th time this week. I might have body dismorphia because I don't view myself the same as others do. \n\nAt this point I'm considering just transitioning to running/jogging as my main form of exercise. It's better than going to Planet Fitness where it's super crowded all the time and girls literally stare and laugh at me for some reason. Maybe other girls can sense my low-self esteem? IDK fellas I just **don't** feel welcome there. I know it's advertised as a friendly gym/ \"judgement-free zone\" but honestly... it's the opposite. In fact, I'd say most people at Planet Fitness are more judgemenal than the average person and treat others based on how they look. \n\n Running alone in my neighborhood in the morning sounds a lot more appealing. It would be much more beneficial to start the day off right listening to some good tunes and going for a jog in a park. \n\nIf you got this far, thanks for reading. I hope everyone has a great week.

Last night, I didn\u2019t have any of the dinner his parents made, but later in the night, I asked him to accompany me to get dinner for myself that I found safer to eat. He ended up eating a little bit of the appetizer (probably to make me feel more comfortable eating because he knows I can\u2019t eat if I\u2019m the only one eating).\n\nAfter we got home, I went to our room while he packed his lunch for work tomorrow in the kitchen, while his mom was also there. When he came into the bedroom, I noticed he seemed upset, and I asked what was wrong. He told me that his mom told him his dad was mad at him for going out to eat (his dad being quoted as saying, \u201cHe better not eat anything,\u201d said after my boyfriend told his parents we were headed out to eat something).\n\nMy boyfriend was extremely upset about this comment for the rest of the night. He told me how he hates his body and the weight he\u2019s gained in college and that he wants to lose weight. My boyfriend is about 5 pounds overweight and has no health issues (good blood pressure, good cholesterol, heart rate, etc.). This is the first time he has ever expressed body dissatisfaction. \n\nGiven my own issues with eating, I\u2019m really concerned about his feelings. I\u2019m so worried he\u2019s on the path to developing an eating disorder, but I also know that body dissatisfaction is unfortunately quite common in the average population and not everyone who dislikes their body will develop an eating disorder. However, his family has a history of eating disorders, which is another reason I\u2019m quite concerned. He also told me he feels guilty about eating now when he never used to and how he can\u2019t stand looking in the mirror. \n\nI asked him if he really thinks that losing a bit of weight will make him happier, or if he\u2019ll want to keep losing, and he seemed pretty certain that he\u2019d be a lot more satisfied if he lost a little bit of weight. \n\nI don\u2019t know how to support him. I want him to be happy, but I also worry I might be supporting something that\u2019s potentially harmful to his mental health, and I don\u2019t think I have the proper mindset to support someone through a weight loss journey. \n\nAny advice?", "subreddit": "EDAnonymous"}

The nutritionist is wonderful and helped me address some of my PCOS issues, and I've been working on a plan that supposedly will help me learn how to eat foods like a normal human and I got put on a medication that is supposed to help with anxiety and help prevent eating when I'm feeling nervous.\n\nFor a while, everything was going super well. I finally stopped feeling bloated all the time, I lost about seventeen pounds, lots of my clothes started to fit properly, and I stopped having intense cravings and my binge eating subsided. I was especially proud of myself because I work at a restaurant and I had managed to pack my own lunches and avoided tasting or eating anything from work. I was so excited.\n\nBut at the same time, I was dealing with quite a bit of stress at work (co worker drama) and I've been dealing with a lot more responsibility at home, (much more than I think I could reasonably handle.) Because of this, I started skipping meals, and then eating a lot (but still within the healthy eating plan) when I finally had time. I was still losing weight so I didn't think of this as a problem. I was still avoiding foods that would trigger me and I had that to hold on to.\n\nAnd then this last weekend, my sweet boyfriend did something really nice for me. Knowing that I had a stressful work day ahead of me, he woke up early and drove into town so that we could get breakfast together at one of my favorite restaurants. I am allowed to have occasional cheat meals or cheat snacks, but I hadn't allowed any of that for myself up until this point. (He knows about the diet, eating disorder stuff and about all of the stress I've been under.) He helped me reason that I could use my occasional cheat meal for this breakfast if I wanted to, and that treating myself to one cheat meal wouldn't undo my progress. He had really really good intentions with all of this and has always been my biggest supporter and cheerleader. So I agreed with him and I went for it, I enjoyed an eggs Benedict and a strawberry crepe, and I tried some of his hashbrowns. I ate slowly, and enjoyed my food, and didn't eat more than I should have.\n\nBut for some reason, that breakfast, kind of unleashed this monster inside of me? I haven't stopped binge eating since Saturday morning. I've been eating everything and anything. I feel so sick and my stomach hurts and I feel disgusting. And yes one happy little breakfast won't undo all of my progress, but maybe a whole weekend plus Monday and Tuesday might. I just don't know how to stop and kick my ass back into gear. My family, friends and boyfriend have all been so proud of me and has been cheering me on this entire time, and now I feel like I didn't just let myself down but like I'm also letting all of them down as well.\n\nI have a skype appointment with my nutritionist on September 30th, and I really want to show him that I've made good progress and that this program is working for me. But I don't know if I'll have anything to show for if I keep living like this. I feel like the most disgusting human on the planet and I don't even want to go out. I canceled my dance class for the afternoon, and I think that I'll likely cancel my date with my boyfriend tomorrow as well, because I don't want anyone to know how badly I fucked up.\n\nHow do I stop the cycle?

The idea of SCG strategy was to think of the future self as motivation, so I asked myself who I wanted to be in the future, and concluded I just want to be a normal eater. So I started to think what a normal eater would do in every situation, and today I avoided a binge.\n\nI was near that sandwich place I love and I wanted to have something... BUT THEN I started to talk to me. I asked myself what a normal eater would do. \"Am I hungry?\" No I wasn't. And I started to think what my sister, my mother, my coworkers, would do in that case. The answer was always \" they wouldn't stop, they wouldn't even think about it\". And I acted like them!\n\nI know.. tHanKs I'm CuReD. BUT it worked for me!\n\nEdit: the basic idea is.. I feel like I \"unlearned\" my normal behaviour and now I need to have a role model to learn it again. I think I lack a sense of normality. I don't want to be pretty or skinny. Just want to be normal. Just like the other girls. What do they feel, how do they act?", "subreddit": "EDAnonymous"}

We talked as usual in the kitchen when we were both home and unwinding.  She did explain how stressed she was and that she felt a lot of pressure but also how she was lost in such a new life (we just moved and it\u2019s her first job after university). \n\nThen when I was in bed, my cat opened the door (the doors are very easy to open in our new place) and got on my bed leaving the door open.

But yesterday it REALLY showed. She's admitted that she \"used to\" have problems and starve to keep her weight down, but now she has some kind of EDNOS that I never really notice. \n\nHer weight has always been the same. Maybe it fluctuates, but she's always looked the same no matter what she says. Even when she supposedly lost a ton of weight for our cruise, she looked the same. \n\nShe always SEEMS like she's trying to diet, yet I can't eat anything around her without her getting upset that I didn't share. \n\nI want to share a series of fucked up things that have happened, leading up to yesterday. \n\nI've had an ED for about 17 years, it really got big about 9 years ago. I didn't notice mom's bullshit until recently, maybe 3 years ago. \n\n4 years ago she went on an all fruit diet for a couple months before we went on a cruise. I didn't think anything of it cause I do it all the time and feel that it is healthy. BUT she had to live at my grandma's at the time cause she sold her house and didn't find a new one yet. And my grandma was making her lose her mind. She had to hide all her food in her room just to avoid my grandma asking her EVERY TIME \"what are you eating?\"\nAnd I get it. Any time we went to the kitchen and made a sound, she would yell from downstairs \"WHAT ARE YOU EATING?\" or we would hear her electric recliner going up cause she was on her way to come see what we were eating. (my mom was there for 6 months, I moved out after 1) So my mom started to spiral. \n\nNext year I got pregnant. I had moved into my mom's new house. Food was slowly becoming an issue... \n\nAfter I had the baby, all hell broke loose. \n\nI was eating upwards of 5,000 calories a day cause I was ravenous from breastfeeding and I was still losing weight. I think this bothered her. \nShe always wants to lose weight, but EVERY. DAMN. TIME. I cooked anything, she would do the same shit that my grandma did to her to make her homicidal. She would show up to the kitchen wondering where her share was. I could never have anything to myself. I'd have to give her half and still be hungry afterward. \nI tried to tell her, I'm eating for two, I'm absolutely starving, etc. I started eating top ramen just so I wouldn't have to share cause she hates it. \n\nThere would be times where I ASKED her if she wanted a vegan BLT and she would say she only wanted a bite of mine. NO YOU CANT HAVE A BITE. She always takes the BEST bite. I'd tell her she either gets her own or nothing cause I don't want her to fucking ruin mine. She would throw a huge damn fit. Or if she agreed that she would leave me alone, she would STILL show up in the kitchen when I was done cooking, expecting me to share. If I got upset about it, she would throw a fit and not talk to me for the rest of the night. \n\nShit like this would happen all the time. \n\n[Edit: Another thing that she does is ask me questions while my mouth is full and insist I answer immediately, which I have explained really upsets me. She just gets angry and tells me she \"can't remember my stupid food rules\"]\n\n\nShe always wants to \"split\" food cause she never wants the whole thing, as if she's not already fat. I don't want to split. I want the whole thing or I will be unhappy. But she always gets upset with me for wanting my own. I've come to HATE the word split. Just hearing her say it makes my skin crawl. \n\nSometimes I would make vegan Mac and cheese. This was the BIGGEST fucking problem in the house. I had to stop making it all together. After cooking it she would zoom into the kitchen to scrape all the cheese out of the pot and lick it. This was so fucking nauseating it would ruin the whole thing for me and I'd lose my appetite completely and be unable to eat what I had just worked on. She would become evil when I begged her to not do it. One time after I made it, the second I dumped the pot out I rushed it to the sink, and there she was, screaming at me to not do it, but I was already putting soap and water in it, so she wouldn't ruin my day once again. She yelled at me \"YOU ARE SO FUCKING MEAN\" and started crying. She furiously took the last beer out of the fridge, slammed the door, and locked herself in her room the rest of the night. That was the last time I made Mac and cheese unless she went out of town. \n\nI kept having to share my food, she kept getting fatter. Sometimes I would take a bigger portion (BREASTFEEDING) and she would get furious, call me selfish and entitled. \n\nShe would never, NEVER, just cook her own fucking food. Granted, she's pretty bad at it. But she wouldn't even try. I was responsible for cooking. She put that on me. \n\nI couldn't do it anymore. Once I was done breastfeeding, I had a job. I would eat outside of the house, or after she fell asleep. Sometimes the noise in the kitchen woke her up. I think she was more angry that I was eating than she was about being woken up. \nSo I was like fuck it, I won't ever eat at home. I lost a shitload of weight. But she wouldn't take any part of responsibility in that, the way she treated me. I forgot to mention she has BPD. She can do no wrong. \n\nShe kicked me out of the house a year and a half ago. I could finally cook again. Weigh my food in peace. Not worry about getting in trouble for eating. It's been so nice. \n\nWhen I go to her house there's nothing to eat. I always ask her what the hell she eats. She tells me she has pretzels and wine for dinner. Ok. Her produce is always going bad... \n\nWhen we go to my grandma's house my daughter usually asks to order pizza. If baby is there, granny usually orders pizza. This PISSES my mom off for some reason. Probably cause she doesn't want us to constantly eat this junk food. She hates having it in front of her cause she can't not eat it, I get that. She always tells me to try and convince my grandma to not order it. She always complains. \n\nI went over there last night, my mom was planning to be there later. My grandma made me order a pizza, kept insisting I do it ASAP. Then my mom calls, my grandma tells her to hurry over cause I just ordered pizza. She got SO. FUCKING. MAD. She was on speaker and called both of us inconsiderate and \"Incredibly self-centered\"\nWhy bitch? She never wants pizza and now that we ordered one before she was there she's furious? She lives two blocks away. She could have beat the pizza guy there. She ended up cancelling the whole thing. So I just hung out with granny. Which is fine. My mom always gets Incredibly bitchy when we all eat together. She's so angry at restaurants.  This was really when I was like, damn, she's got an ED. She cancelled over food that she pretends to never want. \n\nI understand the ED brain. I can see why she would be mad for no good reason. But damn I always thought she flipped out on me mostly cause of her BPD. no. It's both. BPD and ED. I can never live with this woman again.", "subreddit": "EDAnonymous"}

After a summer of weight maintenance due to sleep eating binges, I managed to drop 10 pounds in a week after being freaked out by the previous week, in which my binge eating got out of control and I went up 6 pounds. So, a 4 pound drop, lots of water weight swings in 2 weeks due to disordered eating.\n\nI felt SO PROUD of my self control last week, and now this week I'm slipping again. I'm mad at myself and scared. I have \"exercise bulimia,\" and since I never know when a binge is coming, I exercise 2-3 hours a day. I have no free time for anything. I work and exercise and that's it. This has been my life for a year and a half. \n\nI don't know how to stop the restrict/binge cycle. It's like a number on a scale needs to scare me into it, and I don't like this about myself. Where did my self control go!? \n\nI'm about 14-25 pounds from my goal weight after losing 106 pounds so far. Maybe I'm scared of reaching my goal weight because I know nothing in my life will change happiness-wise if I don't fix the problems that have caused me to binge my whole life. I'll eventually put the weight back on and more if I don't fix this. I can't spend my entire life exercising away all my free time, which then I think also leads to binge eating.\n\n  \nThe real reason for this post, I guess, is that I'd like some support concerning tomorrow. Normally, Thursdays after work are 15-20 minutes intense elliptical- 30 minute core strength training class- 1 hour turbo kickboxing class.\n\nTomorrow is my boyfriend's birthday. All he wants to do is go to a seafood BUFFET. I have not stepped foot in a buffet since the weight loss journey began. I'm hoping I'll be okay because I can eat crab legs and sashimi, but I'm so scared of the temptation you guys. And so scared of missing my workout. And I don't want to let this ruin my boyfriend's birthday. It's also my sister's birthday the next day, and her birthday party also interferes with my Friday night exercise routine. And there will be a lot of food at the party as well, even though I'm going to make sure there's a veggie tray. I just feel so DEPRIVED when I can't EAT EVERYTHING. But I know that eating is supposed to be fuel. For me, it's a drug. A drug that I can't avoid.\n\nSo yes. I know I need a team of doctors, most likely, long term to fix this lifelong problem. And I mean, since age 2. I'm 32 years old and my mom said she started having to take food away from me at age 2. So this is who I am at my core and every day is a struggle. \n\nRight now, I just need help getting through tomorrow. And Friday. And mostly, it's not even the food stuff that scares me, but the emotional stuff behind WHY I need this food. I don't want to feel deprived and I don't want to risk triggering a binge. ANY ADVICE, FOR THE LOVE OF GOD ON HOW TO ENJOY MYSELF WITHOUT FEAR OR TRIGGERS!? I'm going crazy here trying to figure out how to be \"a normal person enjoying food without abusing it.\"\n\nThank you.", "subreddit": "BingeEatingDisorder"}

I think it should be mentioned that I have ADHD, the reason I bring this up is, I tend to overeat, my pill limits my hunger, so I tend to over eat when it wears off..my parents think it;'s simply just me overeating a bit. I recently started 12th grade, and I've always had a hard time at school, I've always been bullied. More so due to me being labeled as autistic (I'd say I breech some traits of autism, but not enough to really be labeled as autistic, kinda confusing.) I hit puberty at 8, and got my period at 8 as well. Girls would make fun of me, I felt bad about it, I then started to gain weight, at first it was just overeating and simply eating the wrong foods to often, my parents weren't really there a lot of the time it felt (Physically, they are very loving) so my sister would often make me food. I found that I had almost an addiction to sweets. I know kids like sugar, that's normally a given, but I gave a new meaning to the word LOVE. I enjoyed it, so much so I would go hunting for sugary foods. I was pretty active as a kid so I burned it all off, but by age 11, I was hit with depression. I stopped running around, I started staying in my room more often, I rarely talked to my parents, and my love of sugar grew, this is when I started loving carbs. Breads are a weakness, it's quick, it's easy, and that's what I look for in a binge. I shove as much as I can in my mouth, as quick as I can. Breads and sugary snacks are so convenient for that. I started to gain weight, I was no longer moving a lot. by 13, I was in grade 8, and that binging turned to me purging, or fasting, but it never lasted long. I started hoarding food, I didn't want people to know how much I ate. I would hide wrappers, stuff bowls in baskets. My mother is a good mother, but she doesn't understand. She often takes this as me being lazy and a pig. I never truly finished grade 8, things kind of looked up for me half way through grade 9 and 10, then grade 11 hit. I once again was binging, this time, I was purging to. I started to do it so much that I was bleeding whenever I would even cough. My throat was ruined and the back of my teeth were sensitive. I stopped going to school for a long time, at least for a full day because I felt so ashamed of myself. Over the summer my sister was here, and she made sure I didn't do anything like that while she was here. I found myself trying to make her proud, but I still over ate, but I'm not disappointing, I didn't purge. I would be lying though if I said my binging was magically cured. She eventually left and once more, I had the stress of school. I've been going but as of this week, I binged. And it was bad. 2 hours later after my binge I saw just how much I ate. My father wasn't home and my mother was in Quebec, (we live in Ontario, so it's a long drive) I had eaten almost 16,000 calories within 2 hours. I couldn't even move I was in so much pain, but I was so scared of the disgust my family would feel, that I cleaned it up. I didn't go to school because of how sick I felt, but I'm scared to explain it to my parents, I can't fall back into the routine of missing and skipping school, I need to graduate, but I'm so disgusted after a binge, I can't face anyone. Not to mention my guidance counselor just tells me to \"think positive thoughts\" how can I when I feel like a pig?

{"post_id": "d69l7s", "created_utc": 1568871166, "title": "i feel stuck", "author": "diripui", "self_text": "Hi, I'm a 6'0'' 19 year old male, first time poster. I've recently finished outpatient treatment for AN, and I really want to vent.\n\nI've had body dysmorphia for a long time. When I was about 12, mirrors and photos were the bane of my existence. It felt embarrassing acknowledging the body I was in, and I tried my best to ignore it. That's only natural being an anxiety riddled boy who was too afraid to open up. I was repulsed by how chubby I was in my prepubescence, but what i despised the most were my sides. Love handles, side belly fat, stretched hips, whatever the  common terminology is. I HATED that they would stick out compared to the rest of my body. My middle school self ended up associating it with my chubbiness as I continued to shove away my body image into a dingy crevice in my mind.  \n\n\nIn high school, I got a bit skinnier. A growth spurt probably helped with that, as I didn't really change my eating habits. The awareness I held of my body image began to become more and more noticeable in my consciousness. Despite most of my body proportionally slimming down a bit, my hip fat was still there. Ok, this thing can't be resolved by puberty alone. Fine. I decided I wanted to do something about it. \n\nI cut out snacks. Only 3 meals a day. I lost 10 pounds. Progress...?\n\nMy sides stayed the same.\n\nIt was time to cut out one of my meals. At this point in time, i had just graduated high school, and was enjoying my last summer before my departure for college. I decided to sleep in frequently so I could manage eating 2 meals a day, and distract myself from food spending my days with friends. It worked out pretty well; I would just drink water whenever I would get unnecessarily hungry, or deal with it until my next meal. It wasn't that bad. In fact, it was good. I would get comments about being thin, and be compared to my naturally skinny brother. It felt so validating and accomplishing. I could even frequently look in the mirror and be somewhat happy with what I saw!\n\nBut my sides refused to slim down.\n\n College rolled around. For a point of reference, I was 18 and 140ish lbs. As soon as I gained independence, my conservative eating habits spiraled into full-blown anorexia. The thoughts about tracking food and eating as little as possible basically always occupied my mind. I would always strive for under 1000 calories a day. I began to love being hungry; it meant i was losing weight. I dropped to 130. Everything felt so satisfying... but there would be days where I would impulsively eat \"bad\" foods. I felt like dying. I ran until i was light headed to compensate. I had to feel thin, I had to. I was doing the best I could to lose weight, and torturing myself felt worth it...\n\nMy side fat stubbornly stuck out throughout it all.\n\n130 dropped to 120. I knew i had a problem, but it felt so good. I knew i had to have anorexia! That's proof i'm skinny, right?? I looked like a skeleton. My sides still stuck out. I was a skeleton with fatty love handles. The bad feelings started to outweigh the good ones. I would hate eating anything. Why did I still have to eat...\n\nAt this point, the rational part of me took over and knew I was going to die if i didn't do something. I called my parents and told them I thought I had an eating disorder, my weight... they were scared. I was scared.  \n\n\nI went home indefinitely the next day.\n\nFor the next 6 months, I received outpatient FBT. It was fucking awful. Instead of going back to school the next semester, I was stuck at home eating every 3 hours. The beginning of recovery was probably the most miserable moment of my life. I felt stupid, worthless, bloated, paranoid... It was horrible. \n\nBut if i didn't gain 40 pounds, I couldn't go back to school. As awful as it felt gaining weight, it would be worse having to be stuck at home letting my mind rot. I gained back the weight. It was slow, miserable... but I gained it back. I was able to return to school, and that's where I am right now. Recovery was enormously helpful, despite how miserable it started out. I've learned a lot and am much healthier now.\n\nBut every so often, the stubborn side fat I have to endure makes me fall back into the same anorexic panic.\n\nThis brings me to my current situation. I have to maintain my weight to stay in school, but this insecurity about my fucked up belly fat eats at me every single day. I can't do anything about it without risking my education, as I would feel so stupid and unaccomplished if I had to stop again. I'm too afraid to try healthy ways of losing fat, as it could jeopardize everything. My parents are very, very on top of my weight maintaining process (not in an overbearing way, they've been very supportive) so something little could even bring up concerns. Am I just cursed with shit genetics? Do I have to live looking like this forever? I really don't know. I feel like I'm gonna be stuck like this forever. It feels horrible looking so much flabbier than even people who weigh more than me. Aaaaaaa fuck. Sorry for the long post.", "subreddit": "EDAnonymous"}

I was able to lose weight this way (along with lots of working out), but it has been hard. I've read of so many people who have done IF and it has helped them so much, but I've also read that it can be very triggering for people with eating disorders. Still, for me, it has been instrumental in helping me manage my weight battle.\n\nBut lately, I've found myself obsessive and the cravings have been really rough. I think my body wants to return to its set point, which is in the obese range.\n\nHere's what I'm doing now: I still don't eat until noon. Then I have a very filling lunch (about 600-700 calories) that has lots of protein, fiber and fat. And then I don't eat anything until 5:30 p.m. and I stop eating at 6:30 p.m. I eat another very filling meal...where I actually feel stuffed (it's about 1,000 calories) and have no urge to binge. What happens now is that my body isn't releasing insulin as often (which happens every time we eat...even if it's keto) so I don't get as many cravings. This has been a game changer and I wanted to share in case it helps anyone.\n\n\nI want to warn you that it took a few weeks to get to this point. At first, I had one single snack around 3:30 p.m.because I felt like I was starving. After a few days, I was able to eliminate this snack, and I used to eat up until 7:30 p.m., but now I'm able to stop at 6:30 p.m. This is all flexible, but I know that if I stick to these times, it takes the guess work out and there are less chances that my brain will trick me. \n\nAgain, this may be horrible for many of you because IF can be a very bad idea for people who have eating disorders, but I can't sit on my hands and keep this to myself when I've found it so personally helpful.\n\nEdit: I want to add that before I eat, I log it in my food app (MyFitnessPal) and that has also been helpful because I feel more in control. I know a lot of people who do IF love to do OMAD (one meal a day) and that was never something I was able to follow. This seems like a compromise and for some reason, it's not anything I've heard of before.", "subreddit": "BingeEatingDisorder"}

It\u2019s comforting and convenient, the taste of a meal you don\u2019t have to prepare yourself. With the rising popularity of restaurant delivery services, my weekly binge turned into a nearly daily occurrence. Sure, I\u2019m able to nibble on a lean cuisine for a couple of days under the illusion of control, but the incessant cravings only subside into a dull roar for so long. And when I finally relent, I watch myself helplessly as I repeat the same mistake over and over again by clicking on the \u2018place order\u2019 button. Today\u2019s the day, I think on a daily basis, that I stop binging and take control. Just let me have one last binge. One last binge\u2014it\u2019s Friday, and I\u2019ll start the week off right. One last binge, I can\u2019t fuck up more than I already have. One last binge and I promise that somehow I\u2019ll dredge up the self-control to break the cycle. Nothing ever changes.\n\nBut I\u2019m starting to attend a support group for binge-eating disorder. Being surrounded by people who also want to make a change is empowering. The comfort of knowing that there are others endeavoring to better their lives and combat this affliction is more satisfying than any shallow craving. Even though I desire to change my dietary habits and improve my health more than anything, another part wants to continue on as I have for days, months, years. To continue ordering the same heaping quantities of food in order to quell uncomfortable feelings for uncomfortable realities. \n\nBut I think I\u2019ve finally had my fill of shame and guilt and self-loathing for now. \n\nSo I\u2019ve logged out, deactivated my delivery service accounts, and blocked the websites on my work and personal computers.

Sure, I have eaten my share of bags of chips in one sitting, but it's a lot more rare than when I eat fast food. \n\nI was going through the intuitive eating books, feeling like maybe my history of dieting has caused this. But while I think it works for people who overeat because of dieting and the binge/restrict cycle, that's not me. I remember my food problem existing before my dieting problem. They probably make each other worse, but I really don't think what I need is recovery from a diet mentality.\n\nI have had an addiction to fast food for as long as I can remember. Many times, I couldn't even pay my rent or bills, but I had no trouble getting McDonald's or Jack in the Box. It has always been an emotional comfort. I had a very toxic marriage, and the only good times we had involved freaking fast food or pizza, or just eating out in general. ALWAYS. \n\nSo first, hello, I guess I need to be here now. But I also have a few questions if anyone can relate:\n\n1. Did food addicts/overeaters anonymous help you?\n2. Has anyone tried counseling or therapy for their issues with food? \n3. Anyone dealt with fast food addiction - what helped you?", "subreddit": "FoodAddiction"}

TL;DR: coming into this space, we already know it\u2019s filled with disordered thoughts. As such, we need to take responsibility for the choice to post/be here and not come for others who have intrusive thoughts and already feel bad about them.\n\nHey everyone I\u2019ve been seeing some negative posts about this sub recently, so I thought I would pop on to say something that I think is important. If this is not an okay post, mods please do take this down.\n\nFirstly: thank you to everyone and especially our lovely mods for allowing us to have this space to freely talk about our EDs and our ED thoughts. I wasn\u2019t part of the old sub, but from what I\u2019ve seen here, people are very encouraging, and tbh this sub really has helped me out emotionally and mentally. Dealing with an ED can get really lonely, and I\u2019m so thankful for everyone here and all the supportive we\u2019ve given each other, and the support I\u2019ve received too. From the bottom of my heart, a huge thank you! \ud83d\udc95\n\nThat being said, this is obviously a sub about eating disorders. Most people that post here are going to have disordered thoughts. A lot of us don\u2019t like our bodies. A lot of us say negative things about our bodies pertaining to our weight and body fat. A lot of us say terrible, terrible things about ourselves. I truly wish we all did not feel this way, and that we love ourselves. We should not be feeling this way about ourselves, but we already feel bad about that, you know? For a lot of us, this sub is the only place we can voice our dark thoughts about ourselves.\n\nAlong with negative thoughts about ourselves, sometimes we post negative thoughts about others. Those intrusive, ED thoughts that we feel so guilty for. A lot of these posts are usually prefaced with a TW, and, as required, have trigger warning flairs, or they will be removed. I\u2019m not saying that every post here is perfect and that no one has posted anything offensive before, but I will say that those posts seem to be few and far between, and commenters also call these posters out.\n\nFor example: if I\u2019m posting and I call myself a fat whale, that\u2019s obviously not good, but that\u2019s my disordered thoughts about myself. If I called someone else a whale, that is 100% not okay! I hope I would be banned for that. But what if I made a post about how I feel guilty for having bad thoughts about fat people? Something I would never express in person to anyone I knew irl, but have chosen to post on this sub created specifically for people with eating disorders. Such posts usually have the posters talking about how guilty and terrible they feel for thinking this. If we don\u2019t post these thoughts here, where else? As long as it\u2019s within the sub guidelines and doesn\u2019t insult anyone, do we not also deserve a space where we can speak (mostly) freely about our intrusive ED thoughts that we know aren\u2019t logical?\n\nI myself have posted very negative thoughts here, and received support. And if I\u2019m ready for recovery, I know this sub will be here for me too.\n\nLike I said above: this is a sub where we talk about our eating disorders. Coming into this space, I think we need to take personal responsibility for the choice to post here, or to read others posts here. Recognize that maybe you don\u2019t have these intrusive dark thoughts, but others do. If you\u2019re triggered by such posts, look at the flairs for trigger warnings, and read the title and beginning of the post for warnings that might be prefaced there. If you choose to be in this space, recognize we all experience our EDs differently, our experiences are all valid, and take the responsibility to stay away from posts that might trigger you. Call out people obviously being problematic, eg, saying fat people are ugly, or other nasty things like that. But please do not come for someone talking about how bad they feel for having dark thoughts. If it\u2019s your safe space, it is their safe space too.\n\nAnyway, that\u2019s just my thoughts on the situation. I love this sub, and don\u2019t want to see it fall into a pit of negativity. We all choose to be here and post here, knowing that this space is filled with disordered thoughts posted by people with eating disorders. That territory is not the safest for all, and I would urge those triggered by such things to leave and not harm yourself more. And if you choose to stay, do not place the blame on those who tag their posts and already feel terrible for feeling the way they do.", "subreddit": "EDAnonymous"}

You've even been making sure to take your vitamins because ~health~. Clothes are fitting nice and you're getting through your day without wanting to drive off a cliff. Nice.\n\nThen your mother brings home 2 extra large pizzas for dinner. Between you, her, and your teenage brother, she thought 2 huge-ass pizzas was a good idea. You never have pizza, but you know that's because it's a huge trigger food. But this time will be different; you'll have one slice and then feign a headache and go to bed. It'll be great because you don't eat leftover pizza, so you'll be free after an hour.\n\nInstead, you eat 5 or 6 pieces. Granted, it's thin crust and has just cheese/pepperoni. But still. Holy fuck. You tell yourself you'll just go to bed and sleep off the suicidal thoughts now pounding into your head. \n\nYou wake up the next morning feeling bloated. Despite drinking a ton of water, it only made you bloated more rather than flushing out the salt. It hurts to exist and there is no fucking way you'll be able to get pants on today that don't have a stretchy waistband. \n\nThen, it hits. Your stomach says it's hungry. Why the fuck is it hungry?

I'm not hungry; I still have more than half of a pizza inside of me. But fine, I'll have some crackers to get rid of the hunger pangs. \n\nYou go through the day still full and hungry. You haven't pooped, you're thirsty but too full to drink more, and you want to go to bed for a week.\n\nSomehow you make it through one more day. It's been 2 days since you had pizza and you're still full. You're bloated, up 6 pounds, cranky, and you still have not pooped. Even worse, your stomach is begging for food.

In part because I keep recovering and don't feel as much need to come here, and in part because I've been busy. But right now, I'm PMSing like a motherfucker and need to get this out.\n\nFull disclosure, I don't technically *know* that spiraling into disordered eating was what caused all this fuckery... I mean, it *could've* just been a massive coincidence that only compounds the cruel irony of my longtime struggles with my body and food. But I don't know where else to go with it, and know that some people here will probably be interested in this case study, lol\n\n**Chapter 1: Massive Relief**\n\nSo (after being referred due to being amenhorric for 2 years) I finally saw a gyno, who I'll now communicate directly with. This is great, because the GP who referred me was shitty and disorganized and judgemental, and this gyno is wonderful and chill. I trusted him so much and so fast that I told him my whole story, not just the sanitized version that I gave the doctor. He believed me when I said I've been bulking, and that I don't over train, and didn't get weird about it when I mentioned my struggles with gender dysphoria.\n\nHe said that because my estrogen levels seem to be normal, and because I'm clearly in a reasonably healthy place now, I don't have to worry about bone loss- but the amenhorrea is still a problem, because since my estrogen is fine, that means I am accumulating lining in my uterus that isn't getting flushed out, and having that just sit there poses all kinds of health risks. He wrote me a prescription for progesterone, to take 10 days of every month, and said that there's a 97% chance that it'll cause me to menstruate again. Although, in his words, since I probably have at least a year's worth in there, \"maybe take a couple days off work and buy a pack of adult diapers\" for the first couple times.\n\nI said that all things considered, this didn't sound too bad at all. I asked if the progesterone would feminize my body- he said no; that is what estrogen would do, and that if it turned out that I needed estrogen, he'd give me the lowest possible dose. (Tbh, at that point I would sooner take testosterone, but I didn't tell him that. The takeaway here is that I can trust this guy)\n\nI left the office fucking elated. There is a 97% chance that I don't have to take E or T, or gain more weight than I want to. All I have to do is take a super cheap pill for 10 days every month, and endure a couple bad periods. Awesome.\n\n**Chapter 2: Oh god the pain**\n\nSo, now I'm 2 days into the 10 days of progesterone.\n\nFucking hell. This is awful. It isn't the PMS symptoms (hellooo, fatigue, aches, mood swings, and 12 lbs of edema overnight)- it's the fucking dysphoria. I remember now why I used to feel so dissociated from my body all the time. Why I considered doing a full medical transition so seriously, even though the thought of living as a man is uncomfortable too. (I guess I'm genderqueer, really, but I don't personally care to claim the label and just like to present myself as a really masculine woman)\n\nFor those of you who have not experienced gender dysphoria, the best way I know to describe it is that it is like wearing wet clothes that you can't take off. Not everyone experiences it as intensely as others, and it can come and go in waves.\n\nWell, this shit isn't \"wet clothes\" dysphoria. This is more like having a thick, cold, wet towel shoved down my throat and pulled out of my ass. It is absolutely nauseating. I'm in a slightly delirious dissociated state at this point, and am honestly not sure how I'm holding it together so well. I didn't think progesterone would have this effect on me- and I don't think it is a placebo, since I didn't have any qualms about taking the stuff to begin with. Hopefully it isn't going to be like this the whole 10 days/every time. I may have to find another solution if it's still like this after a few months. And the period-from-hell isn't even supposed to start until the 10 days are up. (Though having a period never triggered much dysphoria for me... at least it didn't use to. Maybe all bets are now off).\n\nI expected this to be physically rough. I was fine with that. I bought the midol, extra diva cup, halo top, and adult diapers without the slightest bit of emotional distress. Compared to all I was afraid of, it felt (and still does, I guess) like I was getting off light. I didn't think it would fuck with my head like this. I'm going to push through and hope for the best, and hope I just stay this dissociated until I feel better XP", "subreddit": "EDAnonymous"}

Also asked me if I think less of women who don\u2019t have one- was she serious with that? She IS an ED specialist by the way.\n\nThen my dietician with this fucking meal plan. I burn a decent amount of calories every week, anywhere between 5,000-7,000 a week depending on what\u2019s going on. She\u2019s making me eat every 2-3 hours, I need to net a minimum of 1400 calories to start- which sounds like NBD maybe but when I have days where I burn 1400 how TF am I supposed to eat 2800? She *promised* she won\u2019t make me fat but how is she going to keep that promise??? \n\nI feel like since I\u2019ve been eating more than usual, I\u2019m WAY more hungry than usual. I wake up STARVING and my body is like WOOHOO she\u2019s feeding us. Meanwhile my stomach WILL NOT work unless I take lax because it\u2019s like it\u2019s trying to hold on to every goddamn thing. I feel like my AN/BN tendencies are going to turn right into BED, and I\u2019m not talking shit abt that VERY REAL AND VALID disorder, but just have been on the opposite end for so long (14+ years) I can\u2019t even imagine.

Inspiring. Motivating. \n\nI currently became aware that I could very well be diagnosed with BED. I\u2019ve always had some body image issues. I can recall times in the past that I would binge... eat a loaf of bread. An entire box of cereal. You get it. But it was infrequently. Nothing to ever cause concern.  I\u2019ve dieted for as long as I can remember. I am 40. Sometimes it was a strict diet, sometimes it was just making \u201cgood healthy choices\u201d but I was always aware of what I was eating and what I looked like. I\u2019ve tracked calories for decades. \n\nBED became apparent last year. I am not overweight. I am in shape. Work my butt off in the gym. In there 5/6x a week.  I love lifting weights. Being strong and fit. I regularly get compliments on my physique and I\u2019m not unhappy with my body but I\u2019m worried at the rates I\u2019m going, I bc will get to to that point. \n\nHealth and fitness has become a lifestyle that I am genuinely passionate about. I\u2019m very knowledgeable about nutrition and fitness. I\u2019ve liked testing my body. Trying different types of eating (diets) and training styles to see how my body responds. \n\nI decided last year I wanted a challenge and a goal to work towards so I hired a coach and decided to do a bodybuilding show. All was great till it wasn\u2019t. \n\nI lasted about 4 months. Things fell through. I had lost about 20lbs. The best shape I\u2019d been in. I gained it all back in a matter of 2 months. Eating everything in sight.  I blamed the feeling of defeat, holiday food and lazy cold weather. \n\nThe beginning of this year I decided to get a new coach and give it another shot. Again lost 15 pounds, lasted about 5 months. This summer was busy. A lot of travel and just busy. And this is where the current out of control binging started. Knowing I was going to get back on \u201cmy  restrictive plan \u201c only caused binge after binge. I told my coach I needed a break. \n\nIt\u2019s been about 2 months but the binging hasn\u2019t stopped. I\u2019ve gained all weight back and then some. I relate to \u201cbrain over binge\u201d in that it started as a result of restrictive eating for months and has now become a habit. \n\nI feel so defeated. I\u2019ve read the books. Listened to the podcasts. Journaled. Stopped counting calories. Letting myself just eat. At the most I\u2019ve gone a couple of days then I binge. Just today I stuffed 5 protein bars in my face in a matter of minutes. Then told myself to do a day long fast. Then reminded myself that wasn\u2019t a good idea. \n\nWhat\u2019s difficult is health and fitness is such a huge part of my life. And I feel that this is hindering my recovery. For a decade I\u2019ve been used to eating for my training. Counting calories to make sure I have enough protein and carbs for my workout.  Trying to change this part of my life seems impossible and honestly I really don\u2019t want to do.  This week I tried to spend less time in the gym and started walking more and joined a  yoga studio.  I\u2019ve decided I just need to take it day by day. \n\nIf you\u2019ve read my long post to this point, thank you.

I go from not caring about food to questioning my every thought around food.\n\nWhen I am sick now, you could find me eating chocolate cake and drinking hot chocolate for breakfast. If the cake and hot chocolate are not up to par, I will have to be running around town buying hot chocolate until I have one that fully quenches my thirst for glorious milk, sugar and chocolate. I will also be eating well throughout the day like a normal human, but then be hungry at 11PM, right when I am about to sleep (and I cannot sleep because of the hunger). I'll eat of course, and I'll wake up the next day pleasantly full but in an hour I'll be hungry, cravings hit and I'll have what I crave for breakfast again. \n\nIf I did not have the flu, this would not happen.

I had anorexia from 11 to 14 and have always been interested in how I developed an ED. I came from a typical suburban upper-middle class family with two parents and a sibling. I was a smart, fairly introverted and composed boy who loved sports. As I developed anorexia, I began to lose weight at an age where boys typically gain 10+ pounds a year. This greatly diminished my athletic abilities at the time, and my growth was stunted as well. \n\nI began getting help at a pretty early stage, and kept my eating disorder to my family in those three years. I already was a \u201clate bloomer\u201d before I developed anorexia, so I\u2019m not sure if my extreme delay in growth was entirely due to the eating disorder, or not. Between 11-14 I only grew a couple of inches and stayed, if not lost, weight. I  I hit a massive growth spurt at about 16, and grew 8 inches in a matter of 16 months while gaining a proportionate amount of weight. \n\nSome effects of my mental illness still linger on in my life. I have low self-confidence and often worry too much in social settings. \n\nI\u2019m interested in learning more about how I could have possibly developed an eating disorder at this age (I understand there are biological factors). I\u2019m also curious as to whether or not my delayed growth was due to the eating disorder or not. \n\nPrimarily, the most interesting factor of this eating disorder to me is what it implies about myself.

It's been a rough ride as one of the first steps in recovery is to stop restricting (super fucking hard to not feel guilty) as normally I fast after binging. This week I binged hard over the weekend but for once did not fast afterwards and just tried to eat regular meals. It sucked, then it eventually didn't and I was doing okay, then last night I came home from a long ass shift to a tub of cookie dough frosting (essentially cookie dough without egg, literally the greatest and worst invention of all time, recipe from Satan's kitchen)\n\nI ate way too much of it. Like the rest of the container so like half a tub. And when it was gone i felt the primal urge to go downstairs and just eat everything I could because fuck it, the day is ruined, I don't want to feel like this. I felt uncomfortable and like shit and I wanted it to go away by eating it away. But then I focused hard on what I read in Brain over Binge and what some other redditor had posted about rollercoasters. That there's no obligation to stay on the ride once you get on, you can hit the eject button at anytime. So I chose to eject. I just sat there with the feeling, watching TV, fully awknowledging that yep, this feeling fucking sucks but I didnt do anything about it. When I binged previously, a binge is like half a pizza, ice cream, all the candy, a bag of chips, grilled cheese, like 5000 in an hour (Then fasting the next day and several days of 1200-1500 calories) Instead, I recognized that yeah dude, this an urge to binge and I rode it out and then went to bed. \n\nAnd guess what? I didn't purge or fast, I just ate a normal breakfast this morning. Fuck you Bulimia. Fuck you binge eating, I won this round.\n\nBrain over Binge guys wow, it's giving me hope. So here's my post to look back on to remind myself that i can make progress in this rocky ass road to recovery.", "subreddit": "BingeEatingDisorder"}

I really thought I could do it. \n\nI hadn't stepped foot into a buffet for about 2 years.\n\nWell, I probably won't for another 2 years because I cannot trust myself around all that food. It's just too much, the screaming in my head to eat ALL THE SUGAR AND CARBS. It's like I KNOW I won't go out and get that stuff for myself or allow myself to eat it, so when it's around and plentiful, my brain is like ALL THE CARBS AND SUGAR YOU COULD HAVE BEEN EATING AND DIDN'T FOR A YEAR, GO GO GO GO GO. And the voices get louder and louder, and they tell me, \"Just one bite of everything. Put everything you want on a plate, you can have just one little nibble of everything. YOU CAN!\" And I listened. \n\nThe worst part is, NONE OF IT WAS GOOD. None of it. It was all trash food...except that coconut dumpling and the sesame red bean balls. Ok, those were good. But seriously. It was GROSS. And no, I did not just have one bite of all the things. The worst, most shameful part is that I brought home some of those sesame balls and coconut dumplings in my backpack, was like \"oh, yea, I'll freeze them and have one at a time.\" WHY DID I THINK THIS WAS SOMETHING I COULD DO? REALLY? Nope. As soon as I got home, I started eating them, felt guilty, spit it out in the trash. This happened until only one of each was left, and I was like \"WHO AM I KIDDING?\" and ate them.\n\nThen I woke up in the middle of the night at ate a piece of boyfriend's string cheese and a (small, thank god for any victory) bag of pita chips someone gave me at work. \n\nThen I woke up FULLY ADDICTED TO HIGH CARB, SUGAR AND FAT and NEEDING ALL THE FOOD.\n\nAnd my thoughts went to the peanut butter in the fridge at work. \n\nAnd guess what I wound up doing this morning.\n\nAnd now IT NEEDS TO END, but my sister's birthday party is tonight and I just don't know how strong I will be. It feels pointless to stare at the food at the party and not eat it, it feels like I want to just try and be normal without fearing the calories, but I KNOW MYSELF and I'm either going to restrict (which I don't think I'm strong enough to do today) or eat all the food in \"fuck it mode.\"\n\nWHAT IS WRONG WITH ME? WHY AM I SO BROKEN?\n\nI'd ask for help, but I know I'm the only one who can help myself. \n\nThe WORST PART is that all the birthday events have taken me away from the gym. (I exercise 2-3 hours a day, every day, but since yesterday and probably through tomorrow will only be able to get in my walking, not gym time.)\n\nSigh. Tomorrow I will probably wake up and do an at home workout, maybe tonight too if my boyfriend doesn't glare at me for using the tv in the living room, which he often does if I want to work out at home, and then I feel guilty. \n\nThen I'll try and live off of hard boiled eggs and cucumbers for a day to get myself un-addicted to carbs and sugar.\n\nAnd the cycle will just keep repeating until I figure out how to be ok, how to be normal around food.\n\nI'm struggling you guys. I don't want to regain the 100+ pounds I've lost, and nights like last night and mornings like today put all odds against me keeping the weight off. I don't know how to help myself.

Even my friend commented on how well I\u2019m doing and told me she\u2019s proud of me. I still feel guilty eating food, especially when I have a dessert after a meal (yesterday it took me 20 minutes to convince myself that it\u2019s fine to have a donut after my salad and it felt so good doing that). \n\nSurprisingly, I actually feel like I lost some weight after eating normally? Have yet to weigh myself for more than a month but my jeans don\u2019t feel as tight, although they weren\u2019t as loose as when I was at my lightest. Perhaps having a healthier relationship with food reduces the stress which in turn caused a bit of weight lose or it could just simply be the shift in how I\u2019m perceiving myself. \n\nI\u2019ve also drastically reduced the amount of exercise I\u2019m doing. I used to workout everyday just so I can justify my food intake. Now I workout 1-2 hours a day for 3 days a week and I\u2019m only doing what I genuinely enjoy. I\u2019ve shifted my mindset from \u201cI\u2019m working out so I can have a piece of chocolate\u201d to \u201cI\u2019m working out because I love it and it makes me happy\u201d. And that actually makes exercising fun and I\u2019m always looking forward to it! \n\nFor those who\u2019re trying to recover, all I can say is you can do it if you want to. My unhealthy relationship with food started when I was going through other problems in life and at that point of time, controlling what I\u2019m eating makes me feel like at least there\u2019s something I can control (my appearance which at that time dictated my self-worth). However, if we can\u2019t love and appreciate ourselves for who we are, then how can we accept the love that others are trying to give us? Believing in that statement wasn\u2019t easy, but once I started to believe in it, I began appreciating myself for who I am and with that, my relationship with food became healthier. There\u2019s a big part of me who\u2019s scared that I might spiral back to disordered eating again but as of now, I\u2019m truly just enjoying loving myself and allowing myself to have food despite that little bit of guilt. I wouldn\u2019t say I\u2019m 100% recovered but at least I\u2019m trying and I\u2019m proud of it. And for those who are trying, I\u2019m proud of you too.", "subreddit": "EDAnonymous"}

But for some reason I can't do that?? I stress out if I haven't eaten enough nutrients/protein in my day. The thought of becoming deficient, or too weak to work makes me very paranoid. So i always end up eating more than projected just to meet nutrient needs.   \nI always feel really upset about it, but the thought of purging my meals back up makes think \"if i throw it up I will be missing on my nutritional needs\". I also find it much harder to make purchase decisions because I have to decide if the amount of calories is worth it for how much nutritional value i'd be getting. (Such as eating an entire bag of Pop Chips for 340 cal, but... only getting 4 grams of protein, feeling no satiation and getting zero nutrients. Then feeling a paranoid need to also eat something high protein/nutrient dense, and later that day end up overeating on nutritionally dense foods to make up for it).\n\nI feel like my healthy brain and restrictive brain are always fighting eachother. If i was single and didn't have to consider someone else's normal eating needs, i'd probably only eat the same nutrient dense safe foods every day forever. I was losing a very considerable amount of weight for a long time but I've come to a very huge hault this last half year. Even gained back a little bit of the weight.

Since I don't wanna it end like the last school I want to ask to my parents to change school, but I'm scared they will get mad at me or they'll go to talk to the girl's parents (since she said a bunch to rude things to me, even to kill myself).

I'm in a restric/binge circle: for one/two days I eat around 500-800 calories and then I binge on +3000 calories. Usually the binges are in the afternoon and I keep eating unhealthy stuff untill 6pm. Yesterday I had oatmeal with chocolate chips (174 calories), two rice rolls from a fast food in my area, one was fried and it triggered me, since I didn't know the calories. So I ate half of my sister's fries (the one from kfc), a candy bracelet (sister did it too). One protein bar, one cup of instant ramen and some icecream. Then dinner was a portion of Mac n cheese with broccoli &amp; one mug of milk and chocolate. If it wasn't for the ramen I would ate like the rest of my family members. They all had big breakfast, fast food lunch, one snack in the morning, one in the afternoon and we all had the same dinner. So if I had the milk and chocolate as breakfast with the oatmeal, and the protein bar as snack in the morning and didn't eat the ramen it would be normal and I'm a bit shocked, none of my family members is obese. My sister is really fit even if she eats like shit, my mother is a bit round but she goes on a run every morning and my father is on the edge between normal and overweight.

So today is day four, and at work I was in a position that required standing in the same spot. After about five minutes, my pulse started to feel really weak, and I felt like I was going to throw up. Then my vision faded to black and I got a bit scared. My hearing started to go but someone asked \"are you okay?\" And I told them I thought I was going to pass out. I kinda fell to a squat and my vision slowly came back. It was a bit scary, I've never had that happen before. Was it because of electrolytes? I left work early and ate a little bit, but I'm really not interested in food at all and don't want to eat anymore today. Any advice? \n\nStay strong ladies!", "subreddit": "EDAnonymous"}

It's where I'm not strong enough to resist eating at maintenance every day so I start every day intending to low restrict, and typically end up at about 1,000-1,200. I usually try to convince myself this is fine and healthy and tell myself this is what recovery is.

More filled out than I usually am, I'm also typically 115-118 and I've been sitting at 120+. It's been really fucking with me and killing my self esteem. I don't want anyone to look at me because I feel like everyone can see how fucking massive I am. I buckled down recently because I've been unable to perform sexually because I feel so disgusting.\n\nI'm starting to thin back out, or deflate or whatever.

I work at a computer all day and I've been staring at my fingers/hands as I type because they're so bony and dainty. I'm addicted to how skinny my arm is, my tattoo looks amazing on the inside of my forearm. Tonight, I was doing dishes and I was entranced by my wrists as I moved my hands. The bones are sticking out so much.\n\nI feel so sick when I think about this. But my stomach is empty and I for some reason have no appetite so I'm just gonna keep doing what I'm doing. I'm scared because soon my boyfriend will notice I'm eating less and get worried. But he's said he likes how tiny I am so I'm hoping it maybe blinds him a while. Which is such a disgusting way to think but I can't stand being that big, I feel like I'm pushing out of my skin 24/7 and sick as all hell.

I ocassionally skipped lunch and breakfast but I usually just binged on toast by the time I got home anyway. I never really thought of it as a problem I guess bc I never lost anything I just thought of it that it was normal and the most I ever went eating one meal a day was only a couple of days.\n\nThat was up until 4 months ago. So, about a month after i started going out with my boyfriend I started to become determined that I would do something about the fact that I was fat because I simply had to lose weight. I don't think this had anything to do with my bf and I'm not entirely sure what triggered it. But I started eating one meal a day in an effort to lose weight... And it worked although ocassionally I would get really hungry and go on binges and a few days I would eat normally. Food became my obsession and it controlled my life I couldn't function properly and I was so... So hungry. I felt so so so trapped like my life would never would get better. But no matter what I wasn't rly skinny enough I mean I think at some point I made it to around the 1st percentile (I don't know what I weigh now it could be more than that bc the scale broke and it probably is more than that) but I wasn't rly thin enough and it became so much more than me being fat because food scared me.\n\nMy bf tried his best to support me and he's been the best possible most supportive person ever. And I also have a friend about it who's been supportive but she is dealing with similar shit too. Last Thursday I finally went to see a doctor about my concerns who was very reassuring and wrote me a referral for something and she explained the situation to my dad andyesterday I broke down and asked for help even though I've been eating lunch thanks to my bf help and he explained it to my mum... I think and I rly want to get better... For me... My bf... And so I can be finally happy.", "subreddit": "fuckeatingdisorders"}

I have, since then, lost 55 lbs (25 kg). In the past year, however, my eating habits have taken a problematic turn. That includes frequent bingeing, followed by days of starving myself and exercising excessively to \"make up\" for the calories.  \n\n\nI thought I was okay. I was so sure there wasn't anything seriously wrong with that... just managing CICO. Until I made myself throw up for the first time. And then did it twice more, the last time being last night. Last night I reached my lowest point when I left the table during family dinner to throw up, and then did once more when I got home because I thought the first time wasn't enough.  \n\n\nI don't consider myself a person with an eating disorder... I never have. But then I do recognize that none of what I did last night is normal. So now I'm here asking myself, and I suppose asking you, how does one know they have a disorder?

I like to think I never had a problem with food, but ever since I can remember I feared eating in front of people. My family would comment if I ate too much or too little and I didn't want other people to think I was gross. When I was maybe around 9 years old, I told my mom that I thought eating was \"a waste of time.\" Ever since then she always brings it up whenever the conversation of food, weight, etc. comes up. When I was young and underweight, my mom also liked to show off how skinny I was. So it almost feels like I need to be skinny as it is part of my identity. \n\nThe past couple years I started binging right after I hit my goal weight. Now I'm 15 pounds heavier than when I started trying to lose weight 4 years ago. My sister, who was always on the chubbier side, lost almost 20 pounds over the last year or so and is now really skinny. She loses weight from the arms and legs first, so her limbs are practically sticks now. My other sister lost a bunch of weight a couple years ago and is also really thin but has curves in all of the right places. So now I'm the fat one and for the past few months my family brings it up at least 3x a week. My mom always asks me how much I weigh (I usually say \"I don't know/care\") or she says \"Wow, --- is skinnier than you now.\"\n\nIt's gotten to the point that I don't want to do anything with them and I'm desperate to lose weight as fast as possible. My goal weight has decreased although I've grown a few inches since the start of my diet a few years ago. This is a super long post, but I just wanted to vent since I have trust issues that  prevent me from taking to people about anything real.", "subreddit": "EDAnonymous"}

He was weighed fully clothed and with shoes on. That number has *got* to be lower than what it is. \n\nSo for reference- his weight is so low that being *one pound lighter* is an anorexic\u2019s goal weight. \n\nAnd he just... won\u2019t eat, sometimes. He\u2019s always been the type to put off eating for hours and hours, especially if he\u2019s absorbed into something like a game or TV show. But now it\u2019s a problem. The stuff he eats isn\u2019t even calorie dense to make up for his lost time- I made his favorite soup last night and actually looked at the nutrition information- it\u2019s *75 calories*. And he considers that a *meal*. (Internally thinking damn, that\u2019s a nice meal for myself). \n\nHe\u2019s been without a steady income for a while due to being out on medical leave and relying on disability, so I\u2019ve been the main breadwinner. Which he definitely does not enjoy, because that means I\u2019m buying all the food and he can\u2019t buy anything. He gets it in his head that it\u2019s unfair to me, that I\u2019m wasting my money. So he\u2019ll refuse things I try to get for him. He won\u2019t tell me what food he wants or will not eat. Offering to cook or go out for take away is a nightmare- it\u2019s always about what *I* want and what I want is to fucking *scream*. \n\n*I* don\u2019t want to eat. If I *do* want to eat, it\u2019s something vegetarian and low calorie as I can manage. This is shit he *shouldn\u2019t* be having. He needs bulky, high-protein, high-calorie foods. I need to lose weight. He needs to gain weight. I want to cry every time it\u2019s up to me to figure out meals. \n\nI\u2019ve tried finding protein powder and shake mixes he can use to supplement his diet (shit I had to do in recovery, so it\u2019s not like I don\u2019t know what the hell I\u2019m talking about), even his mom has made him shakes and brought around snacks he might actually eat. \n\nIt\u2019s a fucking struggle and no matter how I tell him or how many times I tell him this is upsetting on so many levels, he shakes it off. Defers it to he\u2019s doing the best he can and he\u2019s not going to go out of his way for anything. That sure, he *hates* how his body looks and feels and genuinely wants to bulk up- but not right now. Never right now. \n\nSomehow he turns it to me and brings up if he does gain and even start putting in muscle, it\u2019s going to bring me down since I\u2019m not trying to get fit and that I\u2019m already insecure enough about my body that it\u2019ll upset me. Which, I\u2019ll admit, isn\u2019t too off the mark. But he seems to be ignoring the fact that *this* is *more* upsetting. I never wanted to be a Super Fit Insta Model- I want to be skeletal and gaunt. I want what he has *now*. The most I fear is him getting female attention and realizing how shit I am and leaving me for someone. Otherwise, I so much prefer him to hit the gym and bulk up as much as he can. Honestly, I\u2019m getting to the point that if it *does* lead to him meeting someone better than me, then so be it. At least he\u2019ll be healthier. \n\nAnd I know so much of this is him being depressed. But he\u2019s in such denial of it. I just want to help him. I just want him to help himself. \n\nAnd selfishly, I just want him to not be so much skinnier than me. I want him to eat more than me. I want to be the tiny one.

My name is Lauren and I am a few years into recovery.  I am a college student and I have been trying to unravel what deeper issues catalyzed my eating disorder 6 years ago.  I feel like I began to understand a large part of why it began and I wanted to share in case anyone feels similarly.  I marked this as a celebration because I finally connected all of these dots and my therapist will be proud of me when I tell him about this journey :,)\n\n (It is focused a lot on queerness ... just a heads up!)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI was in elementary school when I realized my attractions were different. They were not something I heard my classmates talking about.  Society in no way projected these interests either.\u00a0 I was attracted to the boys in my class, but girls would also catch my eye.  Because I was scared of being different, I decided not to talk about these feelings.\u00a0 \n\nAt church, I was being told that people who acted on same-sex attraction were not only sinning for themselves but dragging others down to sin too. There was never a pamphlet on \u201cWhat to Do if You\u2019re Catholic but Also Thinking You Might Not be Straight\u201d.\u00a0 It was assumed it was a choice. It was assumed you would make the right one.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n So, I repressed these feelings.\u00a0 I stayed with my attraction to boys, and I decided that was the one I would allow to flourish.\u00a0 I was angry at myself that I would hurt someone else with my actions- that it was my responsibility to watch out for others as well.  I felt so guilty that my existence was going to put sin into the world if I ever decided to fully understand it.  It was so upsetting to come to the realization that if I ever wanted to know who I was, I would be hurting someone.  \n\n I finally got to the conclusion that I simply did not want to take up space in the world.  If my existence was going to hurt other people\u2019s souls, I did not want to exist.  Maybe if I lessened my impact on the world, then the amount of pain I would cause would be less. This was one of the main causes for my eating disorder: I did not want to take up space.  For years I struggled to feel hungry, to be forgiving of myself if I wanted food, and to not hate myself. \n\n Then, one day, I asked myself if maybe someone else\u2019s sin was even my fault.  Maybe it\u2019s not even a sin- maybe my identity is not a sin in the first place.  Maybe God really did make me in His image. Perhaps my identity has been twisted in a way where it was not even intended to be a sin. I realized people who did not understand what my identity entails decided to make arbitrary rules for me.  \n\n I stopped thinking I was inherently bad.  I started accepting I could take up all the room I wanted to in this world.  I tried to be proud of my identity, even though I did not understand what it was.  \n\n And then I log onto twitter and see Megan Rapinoe's World Cup pose.  She\u2019s an openly queer person kicking ass in her sport, standing up for what she believes in, and not letting other people drag her down.  She\u2019s taking up all the space she can- she\u2019s even reaching for more. Her imprint on the world is so vast, and she\u2019s proud of it.  It reminds me I can take up all the room I want in this world.  I am allowed to take up space.\n\nUnderstanding these causes does not mean I have been able to drop disordered eating all together.  My eating disorder spiraled into a monster that still will not get out of my life.  It follows me through classes, the dining hall, and my home.  I am working with a therapist to unravel it's hold on me, but it is taking time to unlearn the thought patterns, the memorized caloric amounts of my favorite foods, and the feeling of gaining weight.  I am working on it, though.  That is all I can do and all I can ask of myself.  \n\nSelf-compassion and self-acceptance: two necessities for recovery.

It\u2019s just crazy how many are severely underweight and how it seems to be normal.

I can eat anywhere from like, 5 Oreos or a lot of small bite sized candy bars, or even regular sized candy bars. I often wake up with melted chocolate in bed, something stuck to ME or melted and smeared on my sheets- especially if it has Carmel like milky ways. And I often wake up with stomach aches from being so full.\n\nI'm just so so ashamed and embarrassed. I live with my gf and we used to kind of laugh at/shrug when we find melted chocolate in bed- she is the deepest sleeper ever so luckily when I walk to the kitchen I don't wake her up- THANK GOD. But I'm recently so humiliated ESPECIALLY because we have been having to sleep across from each other in my living room while guests rent out my room- so sometimes I have to check and see if she's on her phone late at night and stifle my craving until she falls asleep so I can go eat once I see she's asleep.\n\nI wish I could stop. I'm starting to see a new therapist soon after seeing someone for 2 years and my sleep doctor suggested I talk to them about it since its an eating disorder. I also have ED-NOS (restricting) and bdd so I already have issues with eating on top of this bullshit. I just feel alone and disgusted.", "subreddit": "fuckeatingdisorders"}

I still binge on healthy food.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHere's what I ate immediately AFTER lunch:\n\n\\-I had a second plate of chicken and quinoa because I thought I was still hungry and eating more protein would fill me up. NOPE. Was craving sweets so I had an apple....didn't help......off to the pantry\n\n\\-2 dark chocolate pieces\n\n\\-Cup of frozen berries\n\n\\-handful of walnuts\n\n\\-handful of almonds\n\n\\-2 ezekial toasts, smart butter spread and honey\n\n\\-quest bar (protein bar)\n\n\\-2 rice cakes\n\n\\-hot chocolate (sugar free packets 35 cals)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOk now that I've written it out, it doesn't seem like that much but holy shit. I feel so stuffed and tired. I HATE how out of control I am when I eat. Like i'm possessed or something. Feels like I can't breathe/on the verge of a panic attack when I'm eating nonstop.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI need help ASAP with the stress eating.

I just moved into an apartment with 6 of my friends which is awesome, but pretty much all of them are the kinds of girls that eat like three bites of a meal and say they\u2019re full. None of them have an ED, that\u2019s just how they are. But as someone who runs and works out, has Cystic Fibrosis, and is recovering from an ED it\u2019s kind of hard when I always feel like I\u2019m pigging out when I clear my plate or go back for seconds or even eat three meals a day when it feels like no other girl does this. Feeling abnormal and gross when I was a pre-teen is mainly what caused me to starve myself in the first place, so being around people like this all the time is sort of a huge trigger for me. However, I know I can\u2019t change them and I can\u2019t except myself to conform to their eating habits because all of our bodies and metabolisms are different, and that would send me into a relapse. So I have a couple questions for you all. Firstly, if you have friends or live with people who are like this, how do you not let it get to you/keep doing your own thing without comparing yourself to them? Secondly, do most girls barely eat (girls without ED\u2019s) and am I the only female on the planet who eats \u201ca lot\u201d?", "subreddit": "EatingDisorderHope"}

I first got diagnosed with anorexia when I was 12, I\u2019m now almost 21. I\u2019ve been in and out of treatment throughout the years, it\u2019s a constant battle but for the past while I have maintained a borderline healthy weight and had been doing okay! Back in July I got the nexplanon implant as I needed to come off the combined pill due to my migraines. I was fine for the first week, but from the second week I started experiencing a lot of symptoms including: total loss of appetite yet weight gain in spite of this, bloating, constipation, hair loss, depression and indescribable fatigue. I tried to let things settle for a while but they only got worse, and I got the implant out after only a month. However my symptoms did not improve, fast forward now to September and if anything they have gotten worse. I\u2019ve gained over a stone despite eating a very low amount calories a day due to my lack of appetite. Since a lot of my symptoms are similar to hypothyroidism, Ive had a few blood tests - the first came back as subclinical hypothyroidism but when they tested again my thyroid hormones were normal. I keep telling myself that maybe this is all just due to a huge hormonal upset from the implant and that it\u2019ll pass but it\u2019s been 3 months now and it\u2019s so so difficult. I feel like I can\u2019t describe the mental distress that this weight gain is causing me. I\u2019m truly miserable. The only good thing that has come from this is that I feel it has given me true perspective on my eating disorder and (probably for the first time since I was 12) I am fully willing and committed to maintaining a BMI in the healthy range once this is all over and I\u2019m back to my normal self. Thank you to anyone who is still reading, this has turned into a very long post hahaha I just want this all to be over, if anyone has any advice/similar experience I would be so grateful.", "subreddit": "EatingDisorders"}

I would go a while doing well and eating, then eventually return to my usual restricting, fasting, counting, and purging after a few weeks/months. As much as I hate to admit it, I don't think I'm ready to give those things up. My boyfriend (19) knows I have an eating disorder, he just gets upset when I go back to those behaviors. Though I've been previously admitted to psychiatric units, I never went because of my disorder. I reached my lowest point three years ago after leaving a highly toxic relationship (the guy was abusive and sexually assaulted me), and since then, I haven't had the motivation to recover. My disorder gives me a feeling of control, and it often feels like the only control I have in my life. I can't talk to my boyfriend about any of it because any time I try to, he forces me to eat and keep it down. He actually gets *angry* when I tell him I'm struggling.

I went shopping, I know, the dressing rooms are scary, but even though it wasn\u2019t my first time shopping after starting recovery this time I noticed different things about my body that I didn\u2019t like, things I felt self conscious about and wish I could change, my first immediate thought was to starve of course (fuck my life) but after giving it a second thought I decided I was going to be healthy and just start exercising and eating cleaner, at first it was great, I was happy about the way I looked but most importantly how I felt, I was on top of the world, I felt amazing but... the obsessive and controlling part of my brain didn\u2019t like me going on a 'diet'...I realized that now I can\u2019t skip the gym without feeling gross, I have literal panic attack\u2019s over not working out and missing my training session, I freak out at sugar and carbs and it\u2019s exhausting, all I think about it\u2019s food, and although I wasn\u2019t restricting my portions I was too controlling over everything which led to a few moments where I lost control and overate when I knew I wasn\u2019t hungry, recently I\u2019m going through a really hard time and I just feel like I\u2019m back on the bullshit, I\u2019m counting calories again and restricting, I\u2019m not gonna lie, I kind of like my body now and tend to get compliments about how 'healthy and fit' I am, but obviously my stupidity thinks it\u2019s never enough, some days I feel like the most disgusting thing in this planet and the only thing I can control is my weight, I kinda feel like if I look 'good' then everything will be fine which of course it\u2019s untrue, it\u2019s messed up because although I have built some good muscle that I really don\u2019t want to loose and haven\u2019t touched a scale in years because it\u2019s bad for my mental health I still want to be controlling and suffer, I hate myself. \nIt\u2019s not even about loosing weight anymore, i just do it because I\u2019m messed up.\nI never recovered and I feel like I never will, it\u2019s overwhelming and I just want to disappear.\n\nSorry for the long ass rant btw....", "subreddit": "EDAnonymous"}

I live off sugarfree energydrinks and sodas and lots of cigarettes. But since the girl started hanging out during lunch with me, I noticed that she only picks very low calorie foods and sometimes she barely eats anything, which is unlike her. She also started smoking during our breaks and often makes negative comments regarding her body. This makes me worried and sad for her, I don\u2019t want her to take me as a role model or anything (not trying to speak highly of myself lol) because I know what I\u2019m doing isn\u2019t healthy at all.

It was like someone had made up a disease by studying my life 24/7. It was a very uncomfortable feeling. \n\nI spoke to my then doctor about it after a few months, and she agreed that it sounded like I had BED. But nothing came of it because I had to move country 2 months later, so starting a treatment process was a waste of time. \nIt then took me 2 years to build up the courage to seek treatment in my new country of recidense. Which was in july this year. \n\nI had my first appointment at the ED clinic in town, 3 weeks ago, and my second appointment friday last week. During these 2 appointments and the days inbetween, I had to answer SO many questions, fill out an eating diary, get weighed, measured, and have bloodwork done to eliminate other physical illnesses. \n\nToday I got the verdict from the clinic, after they analysed my \u201ccase\u201d on a weekly departement meeting. \nIt was a resounding, unanimous \u201cYES\u201d, that I absolutely have BED and should recieve treatment. They event took into account my past trauma, and they\u2019ve put together a tailored treatment plan for me, all based on the information I gave them. So I wont start group therapy which is what they usually do. I will start a 16 week IPT course, with a weekly session. And then we\u2019ll go from there. \n\nI bawled my eyes out for 10mins in my car on their parkinglot, because I was just overwhelmed with emotions. I couldnt control it. \n\nI have been SO scared that they would tell me I\u2019m just a spineless fatass and that they cant help me. But they didnt. I actually DO have an ED, and I DO need help to overcome it.\n\nGuys. The caught me. I was falling for 18 years with my BED, and someone FINALLY caught me and now they\u2019re going to help me. \n\nI am 26 years old, and just now realising I am worth the help that they will give me. I am not useless. And now I will learn how to tell myself that, love myself more, and deal with my triggers. \nI am so happy and relieved, there are no words. \nAlso a little scared, but mostly happy because things are gonna change now! \n\nThankyou for Reading my rablings. I just had to get it out of my chest, before I told someone I shouldnt have told. \n\nTL;DR: am not just a useless sack of lard, actually do have BED as suspected, and will start treatment.

This has partially to do with my efforts of making sure I'm eating enough throughout the day to lessen the urge to binge at night-but I'm still binging with my new habit of breakfast and a \"normal\" sized lunch. \n\nI have no control and I hate it. Someone please help me find control. No one I disclose this to really sees the gravity of the issue in my eyes, possibly because I'm in an average size body. \n\nA few other relevant things is I have an appointment in a couple weeks with a therapist who specializes in eating disorders. I have my skepticism about this because I know I dont emotional eat, its 100% out of habit. I'm also a dietitian so I am an expert with nutrition, but this isnt an issue of nutrition, it's an issue of behavior.

I\u2019ll have to pull out of school for a semester and may need more time (I.e., more money) to graduate.

Growing up as an overweight--even obese at one point-- child, I came to have pretty bad body image issues by 6th grade. In eighth grade, I had shed most of my baby fat and was still bigger than other girls in my grade at around 130 lbs and 5'5 but healthy nonetheless. I can't pinpoint the exact time this took place, and I'm sorry if this is TMI, but I could not regularly go to the bathroom and when I did it would be small or once every few days. I get bloated very easily as well. I researched different ways to mend this and nothing ever worked. Keep this in mind.\n\nBy the summer before freshman year, I absolutely hated myself. I began to binge and purge regularly. This continued into my sophomore year but I began to gain even more weight as I'd stress eat all the time and got up to 150lbs and I lost my ability to be able to make myself throw up as my gag reflex did not work anymore. Towards the middle of 10th grade, I began to take laxatives until I started taking Hydroxycut hardcore elite (a diet pill with caffeine among other things) in excessive doses. At one point I was taking 6 at once (3x the recommended maximum dose) and almost called 911 on myself thinking I was having a heart attack. Then, I picked up coffee and cigarettes. I'd drink my coffee and have a couple cigarettes every morning which would help me to go to the bathroom and make me feel less bloated. As the middle of junior year rolled around, I picked up vaping instead thinking it would be healthier. I began to repeat my same ritual every morning and smoking my Juul throughout the day constantly as well. This seemed to temporarily solve all my problems: I could use the bathroom and I lost a ton of weight. I went from 130lbs (which I already saw as an improvement from 150) to my lowest weight of 113lbs. I still am unsure how it dropped so quickly. I've been in denial about my eating disorder for a while. Ever since I picked up smoking and drinking coffee, I thought I was cured since I wasn't taking diet pills or purging. I know I use it as a tool though because recently there have been many reports of people hospitalized because of vape use and I use mine the same amount as the people being put into comas. I'm terrified.\n\nIn the last 5 months or so I've gained weight back and waver between 127-130lbs. I feel horrible. Everyday I see a picture of me from last year in my Snapchat memories and it breaks my heart because I want to be skinny again. Today for a school project I had to have my roommate take photos of me around campus and when I look at the pictures, I want to go to the bathroom and purge. As a fashion major, I love clothes and can't even find the confidence to wear what I want because I feel fat.\n\nI also really do want to quit smoking for my own health but I'm dependent on it to use the bathroom regularly and I'm terrified of weight gain. If anyone can give advice on dealing with my constipation (lol this is so cringy for me to write and I've never addressed this with anyone except a therapist who royally screwed me over) or can help give me some advice on any of the issues mentioned, I'd deeply appreciate it with all of my heart. I can't stand the thought of gaining weight. It will destroy me, but I know my vaping habit will do the same :(\n\nI just feel like I'll carry my eating disorder with me forever, and that's a scary thought.", "subreddit": "EDAnonymous"}

You told me you would help me stop the paintings on my skin. You told me I didn\u2019t need the razor blade anymore. When I was 14, you told me I was fat. You told me if I wanted to eat I had to do a sport.i would run miles everyday. I had to burn every calorie off. 3 years later I would suffer from joint and nerve pain from overexercising. Pain that I still feel every time I walk. When I was 15, you told me I was trying hard enough. You told me I needed to diet. I quickly lost weight. Calories became an obsession. Macronutrients became my life. When I was 16, you allowed me to eat only if I used certain pills to get it out of me. My digestive system would be ruined. When I met my ex-boyfriend, I felt everything would be okay. I felt like I didn\u2019t need to you anymore Mia. I stopped listening to you.

The shame they would have to special order one for me. When I was 17 years old, you told me to stop eating. I wasn\u2019t worthy to eat. I tried to diet. I tried to not do it. Yet, food was my only comfort. You looked back at me in the mirror shaking your head at me. I couldn\u2019t stop eating.

I want to be able to look at myself even underweight and still not seeing skinny (I don't have body dysmorphia, just harsher guidelines for what I need to look like ig)\n\nSo I asked my mom if maybe she and my dad would be able to put me in some Ed clinic thing? And ik 5000 dollars for us is a lot(it's the least we can pay even with insurance coverage), but I don't know what else to do. She told me to just get a job and earn money for treatment myself, but being in a binge phase and so bloated and still wanting to eat everything in sight, but needing to work where everyone can see me bloated ass self scares me so much, and being too low on energy to function especially if it's a job that requires me to be on my feet all day is something I don't know if I'll be able to do.

It's not easy. \n\nLike I'm sick of the eating disorder but I no longer know any different, so what am I supposed to do? I need to find something to idk, give me reasons to recover?

I hope someone else can relate because I am starting to feel really lonely and helpless not only in my ED but with my relationship as well. So, here is the LONG version of how all this started and I hope someone here can either relate or provide some emotional support. Anyways, I have had disordered eating for years now. 2 years ago, I developed agoraphobia due to my BDD-  up until that point, I was eating a hefty cesar salad a day and than binging out on tootsie pops (I maintained a thin enough figure) so I considered this normal. Once I developed my agoraphobia from feeling ugly AF (don't know why, I guess I felt my face looked different.. It could have been weight related but I wasn't aware since my weight wasn't my biggest issue at the time), I started to stay at home all day for months with no social contact and only looked forward to binging out every day. I think I gained some mad weight from that (I never became FAT, but I did start getting \"thick\") and that turned into chewing and spitting since I started feeling guilty about how lazy and gluttonous I was becoming. My boyfriend was \"ok\" with all of this since it was a step up from me being suicidal and forcing him to spend days at a time with me (I know, that's manipulative and emotionally abusive). About a few months ago, I decided I wanted to be skinny again. I looked at old pictures of myself and thought \"wow, I was skinny... I can be like that again\" and I ultimately started working out every day and pretty much only ate brussel sprouts once a day. People were noticing. People were telling me I looked too skinny. My boyfriend didn't. He just kind of.... went with it. Once I became aware of how skinny I was, I LOVED it. I noticed people were attracted to me again and the skinnier I got, the better I looked compared to girls I used to be jealous of. This is how it all went into a down ward spiral because soon after, I developed binging and purging due to my starvation. I bought a scale. I started to lose more and more weight and I loved it but now I can't keep up and I fluctuate like crazy. My boyfriend makes me feel fat no matter what I do because he knows that my eating disorder is the only thing that gives me comfort, and that's only when I look borderline emaciated. I asked him the other day \"when did you start realizing I was chewing and spitting?\" he goes on to tell me that he got worried about me after I did my first water fast and that it looked like I was dying. Of course I took that as \"you got fatter since than\" in my head and it made me depressed for the whole day. I think he's gotten used to me being anorexic so the moment I gain any weight and look healthier, I feel him judging me. I feel him judging me when I want to eat. I feel him judging me when I ask him about dinner and I think he's ruining my chance of actual recovery... No, I don't mean recovery as in gain a bunch of weight because that is NOT recovery, that's just getting fat. I mean recovery as in, promoting a balanced life style and being ok around food, promoting me to eat healthy and normally. He doesn't even try. He's mad cause I spend his money on binge food that I spit out/ throw up and he ends up commenting on how much I stuff my face etc even though he knows I've recently been to the point of looking like I was about to drop dead. He doesn't get it and it irks me because, if he loved me, shouldn't he want me to be healthy? I feel like a failure when I eat, especially around him, and it only triggers me to start binging because food tastes good and no one else is there for me when food is. I always do best in my ED when I'm alone and have no contact with the outside world. I just wonder if anyone in here has any stories about how their ED affects their relationships.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAlso, I try to rationalize some of this because his exes have never been \"anorexic\" so it's not like he WANTS me to be super skinny. When we met, I was thinner than his previous gf and now I look at myself from that time and I think \"oh I looked healthy, not skinny, but thinnish and healthy\". His ex gf seems to be thick (from the last time I saw her pics), still \"hot\" but not super skinny. So, I think he's fucking with my head now that he knows how much weight (no pun intended) I put into wanting to be thin and doing weird shit in order to try to be that way.", "subreddit": "EDAnonymous"}

I guess the signs were all there that I had a problem with eating, but I\u2019ve been reluctant to say that I might have an eating disorder. \n\nAs if thinking about food 24/7 is normal, as if binging nearly every night around 2000+ calories is normal, as if feeling guilty and shitty and out of control is normal. I don\u2019t know. I was scared to get help. \n\nI mentioned to my partner at one point I thought I might have something like BED. Everything points to it, from my long history of dieting, to my nightly sessions, to my attempts to help myself or stop which never work out long term. She told me to stop diagnosing myself and see someone for real. \n\nI was really reluctant to get help at first. My last therapist wasn\u2019t very good, and I was never comfortable enough to disclose my eating issues since they\u2019ve been a constant source of shame. Plus, I went off my medication a while back and was anxious they\u2019d be upset with me. \n\nYesterday, I finally set up an appointment. Different therapist and I was upfront that the eating issues played a huge role in why I wasn\u2019t doing so hot. I was over the moon thinking that something I\u2019ve struggled with for years might get the help it needed. I told my partner about it and she was proud too. Until I told her my main reason was the eating. \n\nShe told me I was vain for focusing on that when I have depression and anxiety. That I\u2019m scared of driving as an adult and *that* was my problem. That should be a priority for me and not the eating issues. That I had already looked up all the symptoms online to \u201ctell them exactly what they wanna hear to diagnose you\u201d. And that my eating habits \u201cweren\u2019t even that bad, you just crash diet and then wonder why you end up overeating all the time\u201d. The worst is that she called me a monster whose vain and obsessed with looking skinny, so much that it\u2019s preventing me from actually getting help for my \u201creal problems\u201d. \n\nI\u2019m so heartbroken. I\u2019ve spent my whole life feeling ruined by my weight and my relationships with food. I binge no matter what kind of meal plans I try. Healthy ones, ones that meet my calorie recommendations. 3x a day or just 1. Counting calories, or just letting loose. I binge every time. She knows this. I lament about it a lot. She just says I have no impulse control and struggle with crash dieting. \n\nNow it seems like she won\u2019t believe me even if they were to diagnose. She\u2019s ready to write me off and the impact it plays in my life. Now I\u2019m second guessing. Maybe I\u2019m focusing on the wrong things. Maybe I\u2019m wasting time and money. Maybe I\u2019m wrong and there\u2019s really nothing wrong with me. \n\nI just... I don\u2019t know who to turn to for support. I just want to be a healthy weight for the first time in my life.

I\u2019ve always had absolute garbage body image, depression, etc. Never have been happy with my weight (except when I was underweight in the middle of drug addiction in my early twenties) but now I am 30. I gained 30 pounds (am I allowed to say that I\u2019m sorry if I\u2019m not) in 2016/2017 from a toxic abusive relationship and here I am still trying to lose that same weight. \n\nI am actually very happy and in content in my job and mostly in life and I am 100% sure if I lost weight I would be happier. I know some people say that\u2019s not true blah blah but like I know it is?! If I lost weight I could get a bf and I\u2019m a pretty awesome person in a relationship.  I just choose to restrict, count calories, purge occasionally and chew/spit because some days I just love food dude. Idk. Sometimes it\u2019s the best. Sometimes it\u2019s the worst. I just need to lose some weight. My goal weight isn\u2019t even that crazy low it\u2019s like a normal BMI. so that\u2019s why I feel like I don\u2019t have an eating disorder. \n\nBut I love this subreddit and I relate to a lot of what everyone says. I find a lot of support here. Lots of laughs too.  I can\u2019t talk to people irl about this obviously. But I love you guys. \n\nOkay so really what I wanted to say is one thing that has developed from purging and c&amp;s is I\u2019m like appalled by the amount of food that goes in my stomach. Like the volume?! God it kills me. I just had a pretty okay lunch (~500 calories) and I\u2019m at work so I can\u2019t do anything about it but sitting here imagining the volume of food in my stomach makes me want to rip my hair out.

I'm starting to push up against a road block. I'm pretty close to weight-restored, but eating-related issues are coming up again.\n\nThese past \\~2 weeks, I've been consistently eating less than my meal plan specifies. I've been skipping morning snacks (instead just taking them in the afternoon), pretending to have eaten foods (just marking them on the chart), and exercising in a semi-compulsive way. To be honest, the walks I've been taking feel pretty good, since it's not yet the completely-gloomy PNW autumn, but I hate how it feels like compensation for when I *don't* engage in ED behavior.\n\nEx.: Right now, I had a donut with my breakfast, instead of just marking 'pastry' on the slip and only eating my eggs and fruit. I've also just finished my morning snack. I find myself bargaining, thinking \"Well if I walk 5 miles and don't have a big breakfast tomorrow it's okay. Maybe I don't eat a big afternoon snack, too. In fact, I should probably have some cheese and a biscuit for lunch instead of the pear sandwich we were going to have.\"\n\nI *hate* this. I hate being ashamed of hunger. I hate chugging water at night to fill up my stomach so I can get away with only having a granola bar for night-snack. I hate feeling like since I'm almost restored, I don't need to gain any more weight, despite a) not being restored yet and b) still losing hair like crazy, bloating, and not getting my period.\n\nMy therapist told me that what to do is quite simple: *eat*.  But I feel bad when I do. When I eat until I'm full, my body image *plummets*. I don't even feel as hungry as I used to. Today, I had the donut and ate all my morning snack because she told me to \"eat as much of the meal plan as possible\". That feels empowering, but also really scary. I still put extra stuff I *didn't* eat on the plan just to compromise with Ethel (ED) so I could still feel- or rather, SHE could feel - in control.\n\nAdvice? Empathy? Anything helps, honestly. I'm f\\*\\*king sick of being sick. There is NO WAY I'm going to let myself relapse, but this is some of the hardest it's ever been.\n\nXOXO.", "subreddit": "fuckeatingdisorders"}

So on New Years Day, I told myself, no matter what, I would start to get my eating in order and make a change for the better.   \nIn February both my fiancee and my boss asked the same question: \"Something about you and your attitude has changed.\" I was quick to become angry and agitated, and was not sure why. However I knew that if it was affecting my work and I  had to do something about it. I finally contacted my companies' employee assistance program who set me up with a therapists. After about 90 minutes of talking, she referred me to a great addiction therapists who has since walked me through a long path of understanding my connection with emotional eating, stress, anger management, and other issues. At our last session she asked that I take another  step and begin making a \"lifestyle plan\", and referred me to a nutritionists. I figured that this was a code word for diet, and went into today's meeting with the nutritionists ready for her to lock my food down and start a chicken and broccoli diet for the next 6 weeks or so.   \nThen the nutritionists pulled a fast one:   \n\"I want you to eat what you want to eat.\"   \nNow let me say that she did give me a guide on what a plate should look like, a recommended calorie, protein, and carb intake, and some meal ideas.But she doesn't want me to cut pizza out entirely. She wants me to still enjoy food. And she actually wants me to increase my calorie intake, which was surprising.   \nI guess my question is, I expected something much worse, and yet she is giving me all this freedom.  \nBut I fear the freedom.   \nI fear the range of which I have been given.

Granola, nuts, yogurt, fruit, saltines, even plain bread, and I eat until my stomach hurts being so full. \n\nI don't know when binge eating becomes BED but I do NOT want to fucking go there.

It's always \"well I'm trying to recover seconds is okay\" or \"I'm an active guy\" or \"I'll make up for it by working out more later.\"\n\nI don't even fucking enjoy it, it feels compulsive and it is absolutely emotional eating, because whenever I'm upset I feel very hungry but not like a real hunger. Just emotional hunger and it makes me binge really bad. \n\nI've gained 7 lbs from these binges and I know it doesn't sound like much but it's so hard for me to lose weight and I'm feeling so fat and disgusting.

My previous attempt at recovery was half-hearted at best, and the results were as half-baked as the pie crust I once pulled out of the oven and gobbled up in a fit of tears on the kitchen floor. Anorexia robbed me of my health, sanity, and love of food. It has made me afraid of spaghetti, and no human being should have to spend what precious little time they have on this planet in fear of those delicious, carby strings of joy.\n\nEarlier this week, I passed out in the bathroom and bashed my head on the cold, concrete floor. I genuinely did not believe that I was sick enough before, but I do now: according to my GP, I have several vitamin and mineral deficiencies, and my heart rate turned out to be lower than expected. I was told in no uncertain terms that unless I started to take my issues seriously, I would very likely end up in hospital with a plethora of health issues.\n\nSo I will no longer eat apples and steamed broccoli for dinner, and I will no longer weigh every single morsel of food that enters my mouth. I will no longer take pride in feeling cold all the time, and I will no longer count my ribs. Being good at starvation is not an accomplishment, and having a visible clavicle is not something I should be proud of  \u2060\u2014 it is a physical marker of malnutrition. The people who love me presumably don't want my legs to look like matchsticks: they want me to live a happy, fulfilling life. I'm about as adept at being happy as I am at making my bed as soon as I get up in the morning, which is to say I'm not very good at it, but at this point I know in my heart of hearts that being ravenous all the time and looking like a demented bobblehead doll come to life has not brought me even a step closer to the peace and contentment I so desperately crave.\n\nOnce I started eating, the extreme hunger hit me hard: frankly, I have been eating enough to feed an entire Ukrainian orphanage. I could probably enter a competitive eating competition and come out victorious. At the moment, I'm trying not to worry too much about *what* I'm eating - if the pesky ED voice tells me that I can't or shouldn't have something, I'm damn well going to have it (and in any quantity I desire). I've eaten quarts of ice cream, burgers, danishes, chocolate bars, and sweets with wild and reckless abandon. The other day, I almost fell asleep on a park bench after barging into my local supermarket in my pyjamas, buying all the food I was craving, and consuming most of it in a single sitting. I'm taking the hot flashes in stride, and I am going to honour my hunger for as long as it takes. For now, I would rather \"binge\" than restrict: it'll presumably all level out at some point, and even if it doesn't, that's another bridge we'll cross when we come to it. \n\nThe weight gain, fatigue, gastrointestinal discomfort, and the nagging, relentless ED voice are all terrifying and make me want to relapse, but I want to make peace with my body and learn to live life on my own terms again.", "subreddit": "fuckeatingdisorders"}

My ability to just throw up on command by bending over is actually a health issue and is fucking with any chances of recovery. I can't do planks or push ups after drinking/ eating because my regurgitation reflex brings the fluid right back up. This was the first effect that I noticed and it was a big reason that I really knew I needed to stop purging so frequently.\n\nSo today I decided to eat and basically was feeling kinda bad bc I was feeling full / full of energy. Because I ate healthy though I didn't want to purge because I figured the vitamins will actually benefit me and enable me to fast a little longer next time so if I just keep it all in then the feeling of fullness will pass and the benefits of health should do me well. Sorry if this is too much info but  I decided I was going to go have a wank to try and expend some of my energy and keep in tuned with my body or whatever. Idk sometimes after eating I get really horny, always been a thing so there's that.\n\nSadly this isn't just a post about how great my self love experience was, oh no, the opposite. I've just returned from a fucking purge that honestly I didn't even want to occur. I was lying down flicking the bean or whatever u want to call it and I feel a burp. More burps, then a burp with a little extra. I sat up and tried to just keep it down but nope, it wasn't having any of that. Not sure if other purgers share this, but for me, once i start throwing up, it's very uncomfortable to stop half way. Not just like mentally but literally physically. There's been several times where I'm taking forever to finish purging and it's really awkward and uncomfortable and I just want it to be over but alas, I go to finish up, stand up for a little, feel nausea and 3, 2, 1 blastoff we're back at it again.\n\nSo yeah, if you ever think to yourself \"wish i was better at purging\" or \"maybe I should try throwing up\" Literally don't because it can progress to a point where you can't always control if you're going to be able to keep a meal down. If you were worried about friends/ family becoming aware well this will increase the likely hood.

If you think you have an embarrassing story to tell, well boi, don\u2019t feel bad because here comes a tale that will make you say, I don\u2019t wish I was her. Long story and I am writing from Mobil so please forgive any spelling and grammar errors. I can\u2019t be assed to type properly. Let\u2019s begin shall we\n\nOne day I feel a bad emotion^tm and what is a girl to do? She binges. Hard. She starts with a bowl of Raisin Bran which becomes 2, the 3, then 5. The emotion^tm is still there. The binge most go on. She makes herself three grilled cheeses. Again, it\u2019s not enough. She looks in the fridge and feels euphoria when she sees her dad bought coffee ice cream from our lord and savior, Publix.  There was whipped cream too, ago she ate the whole carton of both. She checks the fridge and adds peanut butter and lite maple syrup( she\u2019s not a monster that caloricly conscious qween) to the ice cream monstrosity. At this point she\u2019s fucking full, so off to the bathroom for the ceremonial purge. The ceremonial purge goes great, but that school stress looms menacingly over our heroine. College statistics is a bitch for our favorite art hoe. Off to the pantry with the unrepentant bitch. Nothing of value. She goes to her dad\u2019s secret candy stash that\u2019s not much of a secret. Jackpot. Here we find Walmart cookies( the fresh baked chcolate chip, oatmeal, and pumpkin ones). She eats one of each. She demolished the peanut butter cups, the m&amp;ms, and the snickers bar like the animal she is. She chugs some maple syrup for more satisfactory puking. Wonderful. She senses a feeling of doom: \u201cwe\u2019re at 12,000 calories for today. What if I turn into DJ Khalid in three hours.\u201d The protection for this fate is with the holy liquid: Miralax. So she makes a pot of coffee and gets a big ass mug and pours the laxative in the coffee and adds a whole bottle of creamer, for the flavor of course. Okay, some more ceremonial puking and just more laxative. The day goes great except the holy shitting of herself never comes. Oh well. Tomorrow is a new day. \n\n\nIt\u2019s tomorrow!!!\n\n\nShe goes to class so she can be an educated bimbo. \nAll is fine. Some restricting and fasting is giving her mind ease after yesterday\u2019s fiasco. It\u2019s about 4 in the afternoon and she feels a little grumble in her tummy. It\u2019s fine. It\u2019s probably just some hunger from not eating all day. She finishes class and her mom picks her up to go home.  She\u2019s lame because she doesn\u2019t have a license because she\u2019s afraid of ramming someone to their death. The college is two hours away by express way so the car goes to the expressway. There\u2019s traffic. Half hour in , the Tummy grumble turns into a lurch. Understanding dawns on our heroine\u2019s  face. The laxative of yesterday is here to bring deliverance for past sins. She tries to hold it. But then she realizes that a toilet is of top priority for national security. She implores the mother goose to find a toilet. There\u2019s bumper to bumper traffic and then next exit is like five minutes away. So much agony but we exit the expressway into a questionable neighborhood. Our main girl is yelling at her mom to floor it. It wasn\u2019t a drill. This was an issue of national security. Mom gets hit with the realization that her prized leased Honda was in danger. She floors it. We see a Walgreens, aka nirvanas gate. She jumps out of the car and sprints to the door, but she feels a sensation on her leg. She had shit herself. And it kept coming. And coming. And coming. There she was outside of a Walgreens with shit coming out of her body at explosive rates. She drops the floor. Her legs and ass and beautiful black dress and red converse( I had to buy them again after this) were covered in shit.  The side walk( that little one before you go in Walgreens) was covered in diarrhea. She looks to the left and sees a parked car with two young early 20s guys eating McDonald\u2019s from down the street with a shocked look on their face. The horror of what they just witnessed will never be erased from their psyche. They both realized that  girls do, indeed, shit. And boy, how do they shit. Her mom runs over. She yells as loudly as a banshee, \u201cYou shit yourself?\u201d She runs to the car and brings some towels sheets from the beach( this is Miami so we always have pool stuff in the trunk). She wraps me in the beach towel and I am crying and Catatonic. I can\u2019t talk. I felt so embarrassed. My mom steers me to the car( the sidewalk is still caked I diarrhea) and she puts more towels on the car so I can sit there. Luckily I usually sit on a cushion from Walmart so the seats didn\u2019t get dirty. She made me wear plastic bags on my feet and hands. Latina moms are very preventative for messes. Our house is still one hour and a half away. The traffic is a mess and the smell isn\u2019t a rose bush. So there I am sitting next to my mom two hours in traffic covered I shit and truly knowing what rock bottom is. I get home and my dads like: what happened to you? I don\u2019t answer and just go clean myself to the bathroom. My dog wanted to say hello and jump on me so I reflexively yell, \u201c get away\u201dbecause he was going to get covered in shit. \n\n\nThat\u2019s my story.", "subreddit": "EDAnonymous"}

I developed B.E.D. in highschool (2009) and I can't even imagine how beneficial this sub could have been to 15-year-old me.

I can't even begin to summarize the effects B.E.D. had on each aspect of my existence. But here I am, 24 years old, with nearly full control over my eating habits. This isolating, embarrassing, self-hatred-fueling eating disorder is finally in my rearview. Sure, I still overeat, but I no longer feel compulsions to dive into a bag of tortilla chips until the sides of my mouth are raw from the salt. I no longer tiptoe to the refrigerator six times at night to eat \"one more bowl of spaghetti.\" I no longer poke and pinch each part of my body and tell myself that I am unlovable. \n\nI don't have any quick tips as to how I recovered. The truth is, it takes time, patience, and self-love. If I could give any advice, it would be to speak with a therapist. But that's hypocritical of me to say because I never told my therapist at the time about my B.E.D.. I had other stuff going on, and I minimized the effects that this disorder had on me. I spoke about my disorder to my current therapist, which was the first time in my many years of therapy. I *really* wish I would have talked about it sooner. Please allow yourself to seek help. I know this disorder can make you feel worthless, stupid, selfish, and gross. But the truth is, that's the disorder talking. A therapist will not judge you and they can help you find what your triggers are, what is at the source of your B.E.D., and how you can learn to forgive yourself without punishment.\n\nYou're actually resilient as hell. You're capable of autonomy. Your body is strong, powerful, and forgiving. Your mind is unique. Your unhelpful habits do not have to rule your life. You can let go of self-hatred one step at a time.

I teared up &amp; ended up having to wait outside the foyer area because I was fairly embarrassed at other parents seeing me cry over a song about a spaceman!\n\nI don't quite understand why it happened. \n\nI find also at home that all of a sudden I will feel this sudden rush of emotion out of nowhere. I'll have to go &amp; cuddle my little girl &amp; tell her how much I love her &amp; I almost always end up in tears. This obviously confuses her because she thinks Mummy is upset. I've tried to reassure her I am not, or not upset with her at least &amp; that sometimes Mummy has wonky feelings. \n\nIt's not a happy emotion or a sad one, it's just *there*. Now, I know I'm not pregnant so it isn't that &amp; normally I *will* cry over a film or an advert on TV or whatever. But a spaceman song? A random sudden rush of love for my daughter? I mean, of course I *always* love her but I don't believe I've really cried about it before.\n\nI'm just a little confused! Has anyone else experienced this or know why I might be? Do you guys think it is to do with recovery or perhaps an entirely unrelated thing? I don't feel like I'm unhappy, quite the opposite, but it doesn't feel like happy tears either. Just random crying!\n\nTo add an extra question, I find myself fearing death a lot now too &amp; thinking about it fairly often. I have a chronic illness (Crohn's disease) but that is pretty much in remission at the moment so I'm not in pain, don't feel unwell &amp; yet I'm still afraid I'm going to die for some reason.

I'd been amenhorric for close to two years, but my estrogen levels were normal (to the extent that all professionals consulted didn't see any need for a bone scan).\n\nThe gyno told me that, in layman's terms, what had likely happened was that I'd broke my endocrine system with weight fluctuations. I asked if it mattered, since all I was concerned about was bone loss, and don't like having a period anyway.\n\nHe said yes, there was a catch- I had enough estrogen to have healthy bones, yes, but what I was lacking was sufficient progesterone to induce menstruation. And because I still had normal estrogen levels, that meant that uterine lining was just going to keep building up, which brings with it all kinds of health risks.\n\nHe said that since I'm clearly in a healthy place now, he wouldn't ask me to gain more weight (though added that a few more bulk cycles would probably be very much for the best), but could probably solve this problem just through medication. He said that all I'd have to do was take progesterone 10 days a month. But that if it didn't work in 3 months, it was possible I have a form of estrogen deficiency that doesn't present in bloodwork.\n\nI was worried that it would not work- I have gender dysphoria (almost did a full medical transition, still might one day) and DO NOT want to take estrogen. Progesterone makes me feel shitty enough. However, I don't especially want to take testosterone either- but weighed against taking estrogen/ gaining a lot of fat/reducing exercise, it would be the least of the evils after the progesterone supplement. But the prospect of being essentially forced into that before I'm ready/110% decided it is what I want after all, was really fucking awful. I don't like having a period, but you can see why I was really hoping it would come back.\n\nBut guess what? Right on the dot, after the progesterone dose and 10 days of PMS and dysphoria ended...

I've been to three stores and tried all the flavors they have. Here we go.......\n\n9. ORANGE GATORADE ZERO. I'm convinced this is Literal Orange Juice, specifically 12.5 calories of it, which they water down into a 32oz bottle and say it's 2.5 servings so they can brand it as a zero calorie sports drink. Ew. Just had a sip of this, I'm saving it for when I'm super hungry and will drink pretty much anything. \n\n8. YELLOW GATORADE ZERO. I like the lemonade vibe, wish powerade had a version. However it's too sour and it feels like I'm wrecking my teeth by drinking it, even though this stuff probably has nothing to do with actual lemons. \n\n7. BLUE GATORADE ZERO. It's sweet but watery and the flavor is kinda off to me. Not as good as blue powerade. I got through the whole thing but wasn't super happy about it. \n\n6. PINK GATORADE ZERO. Flavor is A++ but why is it so goddamn watery. I wonder if boiling some of the water out will help. \n\n5. ORANGE POWERADE ZERO. I really hate orange flavor. But you gotta admit powerade makes the most of a shitty flavor. I can only drink this stuff if I'm really hungry in which case pretty much anything tastes good. \n\n4. WHITE GATORADE ZERO. Taste is slightly waterier and worse than white powerade zero. However, this is by far the best gatorade flavor, and the only gatorade I actually crave. \n\n3. WHITE POWERADE ZERO. This stuff is \"white cherry\" apparently. It's a bit sour which I'm not a huge fan of. However it's good enough that I don't mind drinking it.\n\n2. BLUE POWERADE ZERO. A close second, but personally, I like the taste of red just a bit more. This one also get nostalgia points since it was the first 0 cal sport drink I ever tried. my first love, if you will. \n\n1. RED POWERADE ZERO. Literally candy. I love this stuff. the 12 year old emo in me likes that it sometimes feels like I'm drinking someone's blood. \n\nOTHER FUN FACTS:\n\nAll drinks (both powerade and gatorade) are 32oz bottles and are labelled as \"0 calories per serving\". There are 2.5 servings per container, so each drink can have up to 12.5 calories. This is an evil ruse. However if I run up and down the stairs a few times per day I don't feel so guilty about this. \n\nPowerade has 150mg sodium and 35mg potassium. Gatorade actually has more salts: 160mg sodium and 45mg potassium. Both say \"less than 1g total carbs\". \n\nBottle cap of powerade is WAY BETTER. sometimes my weak ass grip strength, especially if I haven't eaten in a while, can barely open a thing of gatorade. On the other hand powerade is easy to open, easy to close. The actual bottles look aesthetic imho. Gatorade looks like a sad inflated party hat. \n\nBoth taste like ass unless chilled, with the exception of red powerade zero, which tastes amazing always.\n\nOVERALL:\n\nRed powerade zero master race. Gatorade is good in an emergency but not really a treat because it tastes so goddamn watery.

But over the past two years I've been dealing with depression which has caused further decline in my appetite.

So I gave it a go... [110 lbs](#s) flat, at 5'11\" (21 years old). This seemed awfully low since I don't remember ever weighing less than [120-125 lbs](#s). When I got home I was a bit concerned so I looked up a BMI converter to be met with a 15.3, which put me at 'severely underweight'. I was kind of shocked, to be honest.\n\nThis happened two days ago and I've thought about it, as well as doing a bit of reading. It seems to be universally accepted that a BMI this low isn't a good thing. I definitely agree, but I don't really know how to proceed from here. I know I need to put on weight but I don't know how urgent it is and how I should go about it.\n\nThe only things I could link back to my weight is feeling queasy/nauseous somewhat frequently. Otherwise I feel relatively normal. (Well, as 'normal' as you can feel when you're depressed).

Because of this, for a long time, once I got older, it was harder to find \"dressy\" options for work and such..... I had to look the young boys section for twill pants for work recently. \n\nIf you're having issues with items fitting your hips but not your thighs, sleeves that are supposed to be 3/4 but end up full length and so on. Check out clothing meant for your race. Even if you're mixed. It might not work for everyone but it did work with me and a few others. \n\nThis also leads to another point: CERTAIN BRANDS WILL NOT HAVE SAME SIZE. \n\nA xs at say, yestyle would be a xxxs at Old Navy in the petite section. A large at Walmart is a XL at yestyle and so on.  \n\nOn top of that, most American stores do tend to \"upsize\" things. A 28in waist (a Young miss size often seen in Victorian era) is a M at Old Navy. 28in is the average size of a smaller end 14-16 y old of about 5 foot. \n\nA much more standard size (a wedded woman often of 20 years) was around 32-36 inches, which is a L or XL in most stores.

On my weird recovery. I want to put it somewhere, I have nowhere else to put it.\n\nI believe I am at risk of relapsing. Like, I'm right at that edge, but the only thing yanking me back is my nightly bowls of ice cream (diet ice cream, but it's better than nothing) and the rock cakes I bake.\n\nI have missed lunch for a week straight. I have also missed breakfast. At first, it was innocent - I got busy with assignments due and maybe the stress of it all was making me feel ill? Body checking used to be scarce, now it's obsessive. With every bite of dinner, I lift my shirt and look at my body. Dinner time is painful.\n\nI was initially recovering for a certain person, but a week ago, we had a falling out. My mental health is in shambles, I know that much, and having a meltdown didn't help my case. It's difficult to eat when the one person I wanted to recover for is angry at me. I know, it's not permanent. But my delusions tell me it is.\n\nWhen I eat, it's too much of one thing, according to family. Too many carrots, too many capiscums, too many bananas. I am wasting money. I cut down on them. I have a bad habit of spitting and chewing chocolates, in which my family warned me how they're 'jam packed with sugar and so bad for you!'. I explain that I spit them out, why mention the nutrition? They just tell me they're expensive. I can't really see how those two things relate, nutrition and pricing. I'd understand if it were the sugar and how it was bad for my teeth, or how the stomach acids prepare for food and get absolutely nothing.\n\nI'm stubborn. If I miss a meal, I'll make up for it at night and shove it down my throat. But I've started to hide my eating, I keep trying to push back meal times and I'll argue with others at lunch time or I'll 'get suddenly super busy with work!'. I thought these were innocent, but it's really just anorexia under a different mask.\n\nAny issue we have is placed down to my anorexia destroying my family. Lots of bills we can't afford? Your anorexia did this, we have to buy so many carrots. We have an argument? I miss the old you, before anorexia took you away from us, ect.\n\nI can't relapse. But I know every bite is getting harder. I had faith in others to tell me if I gained too much weight (in fact, I made them promise) - but I don't have anyone now. People even vowed, \"I won't tell you if you're eating too much because you'll just flip out!\". So now I'm seeing my body as gigantic, even if people still comment on me being skinny.\n\nI don't know how to cope, really. I've tried blindly forcing food into my body, but that leads to bad thoughts and breakdowns. It sounds stupid, but I've started to use fiction as a way to cope. I'm really into video games, so I'll be like, \"\\[character\\] wouldn't want me to starve myself. I should eat, I'll eat for him.\" It sounds pathetic, but it's the only way I can get a sandwich down my throat for dinner.\n\nAnyways, yeah. I'll be seeking therapy, by the request of my family. I don't know when I'll get it, money is tight, but until then? I'll keep leaning on fiction and my own stubbornness to try and get me out of this slump.\n\nSorry, this isn't really seeking advice. I've always found it therapeutic to put this stuff out there, though.", "subreddit": "fuckeatingdisorders"}

TW: discussion of past ED, self harm, numbers, glorification; (also super long, basically my life story)", "author": "12446867azs", "self_text": "I first developed an eating disorder when I was about 14. I was always a pretty hefty child (my mom is as well\u2014slow metabolism, bad genetics. It happens, born fat, stayed fat) but the first time I weighed in at 200 lbs something in me snapped and I just felt worthless and awful and gross. I punished myself with baggy jeans and ill-fitting t-shirts to disguise my awful body and I started restricting. The thing is, I've never been good at it. I have ADHD and remembering to track my calories and do all the math to figure out what was in my meals was too much and felt overwhelming. Believe me, i tried to do it, many times. It didn't feel like I had a choice. I would keep up with it compulsively for a week or so, but for some reason would stop. So I settled with just eating salads I could ball park at around 300-500 cals and felt increasingly guilty whenever I ate anything ever. Eventually when I started working at a fast food pizza chain, I'd eat a personal sized pizza as my daily intake and that was all (often I missed dinner at home because I worked nights). Eventually, realizing that even though I was eating pizza every day and I wasn't gaining weight made me feel comfortable enough that I semi-recovered. I still had disordered eating habits (regularly eating omad) but it wasn't purposeful, just habitual. Although I never dropped below 180lbs, my freshman year of college I felt freer and those days were behind me. I started eating two meals a day, often junk or fast food, but coupled with frequent walking and a more stable metabolism, the weight stayed at that plateau.\n\nAbout a year ago something triggered me. I can't remember what it was, maybe I gained back to 200 over the summer, idk, but I spiraled back into a weird not-quite-fasting/not-quite-healthy eating habit of just omad and self-demonization. Since then I've been On That Bullshit\u2122\ufe0f. \nI'm too scared to fully fast even though I know I could lose weight, because I'm afraid of disappointing my best friend who I've confided heavily into about my ED and who has been there for me unconditionally. I'm afraid that if I truly start fasting and let the ED win I'll ruin all the progress I've made emotionally in my life. I know I'll run back to the same depression that ruled me in high school and that I'll push away all of my friends who are good for me and be left with nothing. \n\nBut like, I also can't resist the temptation. I CAN'T just ignore the thoughts and eat right and just not be disordered and recover. I want more than anything to fast and let my ED control me. So anyways, I've been in the limbo for like, a year. I can't shake the ED but I know I can't give in either. Meanwhile, the toll of the cycle of restricting and binging, and eating unhealthy omad's hoping to get 1500 into my body in one sitting can't be good either. But I'm so so afraid of going to the gym and developing an addiction. I'm afraid of actually losing weight and becoming obsessed with the scale, seeing positive results, and making it all worse. And idk what the purpose of this was (other than like, a clear sign I should go to therapy) but does anyone else feel the same way? Have you guys had similar experiences? Does it ever get easier?\n\nTLDR; I've had an ED for a long time, semi-recovered and fell off the wagon about a year ago. Can't commit to fasting bc I don't want to submit to depression and lose my friends, but can't shake it either. Weird limbo is probably worse for me than actually restricting because I'm eating awfully and constantly binging.

I think about everything I would want to do to a person if I found out the horrible things they did, the same things I did, and compare that to the pain I feel from working out, and it just doesn't match up. This leads me to over-exercise and love the pain.\n\n I want to have kids eventually, and I'm scared that my eating disorder will make me infertile. I won't come anywhere near having kids until I figure out my health issues, because I don't want to give those thought patterns and behaviors to my kids.

This is why I started thinking about reproductive issues, because I'm just a pound away from being underweight (I'm 5'4). My sister was really skinny for a while, when she went into the hospital. She thought all the food in there was made out of people, so she wasn't eating because she didn't want to be a cannibal. She went down to 90 lbs, and she's slightly taller than me. This made me scared for her, so scared, but it also made me feel fat. I felt like, if she could be 90 pounds without even trying to lose weight, how could I be such a failure? At the time I was 120 lbs. I recognize this is ridiculous, but that hasn't stopped me from losing weight. I don't know if anything can, since I've tried to recover before and it didn't work.

I've already known for ages that that was the cause of my issues, but I still enjoyed hearing about the animal vs human brain and how eventually we continue bingeing due to habit. \n\nAnd I tend to agree that the only cause of binge eating is the urge to binge...and that we don't have to solve our every emotional issue in order to recover. I also agree that bingeing is a choice.\n\nHowever, I'm still confused about how she stopped. She makes it sound so simplistic: she just realized the urges are from the animal brain and resisted them. But like?? I get that I'm choosing to binge each time and I have control over my actions. But it seems like her solution is \"just stop, through sheer force of will\". And it doesn't seem that simple??\n\nI've never been to therapy for my BED (only other issues) so this whole time I haven't been laboring under the assumption that I need to do years and years of therapy to stop bingeing. I've always already known that to recover I simply need to stop. But how? Sometimes the urges are so strong, or I had a crappy day so I just don't care. On one hand she seems to say you can't fight against/beat the urges and on the other she seems to say she simply stopped through sheer force of will by having her human brain triumph over the animal brain.\n\nI don't know, I just feel like I'm missing something. I mean I went like a year without bingeing and apparently it wasn't enough to rewire my brain/stop old habits because I recently started bingeing again. In fact I binged yesterday even after listening to this book for days.\n\nPlus there are two other things: 1. I don't know if I believe bingeing has NOTHING whatsoever to do with emotions, positive or negative and 2. I can't disengage from the dieting. Every time I binge it makes me more determined to restrict the crap foods and even before I began bingeing again I was dieting because I'm perpetually caught in a cycle of gaining/losing weight even without bingeing. I don't think I could ever, ever get to the point where I stop counting calories because my natural tendency is to just overeat but I don't want to be overweight. So maybe all of this is pointless because continued restriction just leads to more 'survival instincts' from the animal brain.\n\nI don't know, I'm sorry this whole post is all over the place...just wondering if anyone on here can explain it to me better. I feel like I somehow missed something/skipped over the chapter where she reveals the secret to beating this haha like I just still feel confused on how she did it.\n\nThanks to any advice!!

Originally I was supposed to have my jaw broken and sewn shut, but as a twelve year old, I didn't like that idea and nor did my mother, so I got braces and a herbst appliance.  If you don't know what that is, it was metal caps over my back teeth, a metal plate on the roof of my mouth, and two metal rods on the sides of my mouth (one on each side).  It helped widen my upper jaw since I sucked my thumb until I was seven (did it to cope with anxiety/abuse as a kid) and the metal bars on each side helped my upper jaw cease growing for a while to let my lower jaw catch up so I no longer had an overbite.  \n\nAnyway, now to what I meant to say.  Once I had all this added to my mouth, I found it difficult to eat, and I mean EXTREMELY difficult.  According to my orthodontist, he said he was surprised by how easy my teeth moved into their proper places.  I was supposed to have braces for about five years, but I think I got them off in a little less than three.\n\nSo, if you haven't had braces before, they make your teeth hurt, and sometimes your jaw.  It hurts so, so much.  It wasn't fun, but I miss it because I basically lived off of a liquid diet for three months straight. \n\nAt the time I was in 7th grade and I was a size 7-8, so I was chunky and was bullied a lot for my weight AND my braces, so that was fun.  Since I couldn't eat solids I dropped weight SO fast and I went from being a size 7-8 to a size 0-2 in pants.  I mean, fuck.  \n\nDid I almost pass out all the time?  Yes.\nWere teachers constantly concerned because I either looked pale or red in the face?  Yes.\nWas my mother concerned?  Yes.\nWas I?  ...No, not really.\n\nI grew up being bullied by kids about my weight, harrassed by my dad about my weight, and harrassed by his mother (my grandmother) about my weight.  \n\nIn fact...there were times she refused to feed me.  Times she would mess with the scale to make me think I gained ten pounds overnight.  Times she would tell me nobody would ever love me because I was fat.\n\nSo I loved becoming skinny.  \nSo I loved becoming tiny.\nI loved the attention I got.\nI loved being less than five feet tall and a size 0-2. \nI loved being complimented.\n\nBut it was also middle school.\nSo others called me a whore.\nThat I was a slut.\nThat I wanted to lose weight to get boy's attention or whatever.\nSo the bullying never REALLY stopped, but.

I felt like shit but I also felt so good about myself. I want that confidence back but I went to the hospital a bunch of times that year and eventually ended up in residential. They were so abusive and I still get flashbacks/nightmares about them controling me like a puppet, gaslighting, and forcing me to eat shit like expired chicken and chunky milk as a punishment/not letting me shower/ not taking me to the hospital when I fell down the stairs and fractured my tailbone. They made me my highest ever weight of 125.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThen as a senior I managed to get back down to like 98lbs again. But after a summer of partying everyday I got up to 107 and in the first month of college I managed to lose 5lbs. But I just weighed myself the other day and now I'm 107 again and I'm sad. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo naturally I walked \\~4 miles and played pool basketball for like 1.5 hours after eating like a few handfuls of cheerios and smoking a few cigarettes.

On the other hand, sometimes I look at it and get the strength to go for another minute, hour, day, etc, and use that to motivate me to not give in. I never push my self to go a super long time.

Did I not give her enough exercise chasing things? What if I made her obese?\", all those thoughts went through my head. I noticed she's heavier now than she was two months ago.\n\nThen he said \"Alright, 2.4kg\" and moved her off the scale. \"She gained more than double her weight after I adopted her???\" I was ready to be scolded by the vet, but he didn't comment on her weight at all. She's a healthy Kitten, they grow fast during their first months, I'm actually just an idiot.\n\nThe vet appointment happened one week ago.

Posted on a throwaway on the off chance anybody i know uses reddit. i haven\u2019t the best grammar and my autocaps isn\u2019t on, so apologies in advance. \n\nAround christmas 2017, i began developing what i think is an eating disorder ( i never got it diagnosed and i don\u2019t wanna be the kind of person who self diagnoses, but for the purpose of this post, i\u2019ll call it an eating disorder). i would stop getting out of bed to eat over the christmas holidays, and as a result i would just go all day with only eating very small amounts, for days in a row. \n\nInitially, my motivation was not because of insecurity, or because i wanted to lose weight, it was simply laziness. however, after a while, and id gone back to school, i stopped having breakfast, usually left most if not all of my lunch, and barely touched my dinner. it was around this point where my motivations changed, and i was pleased when i noticed i was getting skinnier (although i wasn\u2019t fat to begin with). any food i did eat was junk food and crap, meaning i had no energy. this took a real physical toll on me, to the point where i would feel so weak that i\u2019d have to lean on chairs and tables when i was standing up, because i was scared i didn\u2019t have the strength to stand by myself. i tried to convince myself i wasn\u2019t hungry, when in reality i was starving, but didn\u2019t want to admit to myself that i had a problem. i was seriously in denial.\n\nthis was made worse by the fact that i had gotten physically skinnier. i was already a pretty slim person naturally, so this meant that people noticed how thin i had gotten. i began to be picked on because of this. it was never too extreme, just a few comments from a few people, but it was enough to make my already weak self esteem plummet. i got to a really low point, but thankfully i had an amazing boyfriend and friends who helped me.\n\nin the last couple months i am much better, i eat breakfast every morning, which is something i didn\u2019t do beforehand. i eat all my lunch and dinner, and usually even another small meal before bed. however recently the bad, self destructive thoughts have been coming into my mind again. even though i know i haven\u2019t changed much in appearance, i feel horrible anytime i look in the mirror. although i haven\u2019t fallen back into my old eating habits yet, my confidence has seriously been hurt, and i\u2019m worried that i will go back to how i was. i really want to get proper help before it gets really bad, but i have no idea how to talk to my parents about this. \n\nnote: they are usually pretty open-minded when it comes to things like mental health, but i\u2019ve never talked to them about anything like this before, and as i\u2019m still eating normally, i\u2019m worries that they\u2019ll think i\u2019m putting it on for attention. does anybody have any advice on how to talk to them ?\n\nTLDR: want to get help for potential eating disorder, don\u2019t know how to talk to parents about it.", "subreddit": "EatingDisorders"}

I've been seeing a therapist for a while, and we both agree that entering an inpatient programme would be the best option for me.\n\nUnfortunately, I'm in a pickle because it doesn't feel like the right time, due to my work. But realistically, it's never going to be the right time. I work in a very small team of 3 people - my boss, my supervisor, and myself. We are hopefully hiring 2 new interns in January. Because we are such a small team, we each have a mountain of responsibilities, and I know our business will struggle tremendously if I am gone for 1 - 3 months. For the rest of the year, we are very much swamped with client work, but things tend to be very quiet in the beginning of the year, so I'm thinking of waiting until next year to actually enter the programme.\n\nMy question is, how do I approach this issue with my boss in a professional manner. I love my work, and my boss is very understanding - perhaps almost fatherly. He does not know about my situation (my supervisor does), but I know it will hit him quite hard too, because we often joke about my eating habits in the office and I know he could feel guilty, in a way. \n\nBasically, I don't know how to tell my boss that I essentially need to go on leave for 1 to 3 months. I'm terrified that it will jeopardize my job, and I'm also unsure of how specific I need to be. Would saying I need leave for health reasons be enough? Or do I own up and tell him I'm bulimic and need professional help, and that would (hopefully) be taken more seriously?\n\nIf anyone else has had any experiences about giving up other commitments for entering a clinic, please share!

It upsets me greatly when people push me to eat, even when it's out of concern. If I lose control and eat something I shouldn't or eat too much I will likely cry and be depressed about it for days and heavily restrict in those following days. I hide food (especially when it's a meal thats been left out for me) to pretend like I've eaten it and then dispose of it when I can.\n\nNo one knows I've been doing this.

Thanks to the drinking itself and the drunken snacking, I went over my goal, but not by much.\n\nYesterday, while hung over recovering, I found myself unable to stop a binge.  It was an urge that I've been able to control as of late, but I couldn't yesterday.  Luckily, the only real food I had to binge that didn't need to be cooked was a 3lb bag of miniature mandarin oranges, some apples, and tostada shells.  I ate it all.  About 16 oranges, 5 apples, and all 10 tostada shells.  But, since each of those things was relatively low cal on its own, when I pulled out of the binge, I was still just slightly under my last calorie goal for the day to prevent putting on weight.  It was close.  I got no joy from the binge yesterday.  I hated it, even while it was happening, because I wasn't enjoying the food like I would cookies or chips or frozen burritos.  It was just fruit and dry taco shells.  I realized that in the past, although I hated myself afterwards, I loved the binge!  The feeling of eating it all was intoxicating.  But not yesterday.   \n\nI think that part of the issue with my binges in the past is that I had always had very bad food around me.   Not only did that trigger the binges more often, it also made the weight consequences of the binges much worse.\n\nSo, I have realized that I  can only stock ready-to-eat food that is healthy and shop for food regularly, a couple times a week, so I don't have a big stockpile on hand.

He constantly talks about food, and what he wants to eat or will eat etc. and everyone also knows that he eats a lot. I see the dude at school and boy oh boy does he eat. And i wanna quickly \nclarify, early in the story that he does not have disordered eating, specifically BED. I've been with my friends on overnight trips and stuff and i've seen him eat (ed makes us creepy huh), and he eats normally, to satiety, and does kickboxing. it's fascinating because he doesn't look like he eats Half of that. He's pretty average height, not skinny, strongly built i'd say, but neither muscular nor chubby. And i've known him for years and his body weight doesn't really change. So yesterday we were talking and he mentioned how he tried to go on a 'diet' yesterday and not eat from 6pm to 12(when he went to bed) and told me that he almost fainted at 11pm and had to go eat. my inner anorexic had a good laugh about this,  it's always kinda of funny and annoying when people are all drama about not eating for few hours. As a response i told him that was ridiculous, because that's how normal people  live, most don't eat after 6-7. Then i asked him what he ate for the rest of that day that didn't hold him up for 5 hrs - and he listed everything he ate during the day. \nMy inner disordered self was having a blast right now and the amount if food he listed was absolutely crazy. And i don't doubt him for a second - he doesn't lie, and we are pretty close friends. To illustrate an example, he told me he eats an entire loaf of white bread with every meal. like a whole thing. 4 times a day. did u shiver by  just picturing that? yeah. So i proceeded to count his daily calories(with his consent), while laying low, just saying my family eats really healthy so i know lots of stuff.(cough cough) his daily intake ended up at NEARLY 5000. He's not too active, even tho he does sports like twice a week, can you imagine how fucking strong his metabolism is? that he looks a healthy weight? im over here gaining weight eating in a deficit!! and he!! maintains on 5000! what the fuck\n\nTL;DR People who have fast metabolism have a special place in hell", "subreddit": "EDAnonymous"}

Or it\u2019s a trip to the local dollar store. Cheap and lots of garbage.\n\nToday, I decided that it\u2019s gonna be the dollar store. I was out the door and on the sidewalk when I gave myself an alternate choice because I really wanted coffee. I could go down to the coffeehouse instead and get myself a delicious latte and a biscotto. And then I had an insight. The latter choice is considerably healthier and also fills a craving I just had. I stopped for about 5 seconds and considered, and I made my way to the coffeehouse and got my latte and biscotto. \n\nAnd the biggest thing I noticed was the feeling *after*. I felt great. I wasn\u2019t actually hungry, it was an *emotional* craving I was having.

I\u2019m currently a week free from binge for the first time in months, so I think I made completely the right choice. My realisation on my change of state was the fact that I\u2019ve been quite overwhelmed with a lot of jobs/courses I\u2019m doing throughout the week and my brain was saying \u201ceat, eat, eat\u201d to combat the emotions I was having but instead I started saying \u201cno, I don\u2019t actually want to eat - I\u2019m full\u201d and that was that. Didn\u2019t eat anything. \n\nI wish it was that easy for everyone, just quit your meds you\u2019ll get over it in no time but I understand people do need them, like when I did need them before I got comfortable and better. \n\nI hope you all find something to help your needs eventually, I know the pain of being in food comas and being scared of looking in the mirror. I still have a lot to do but this is a huge step forward. \n\nThank you for reading!", "subreddit": "BingeEatingDisorder"}

She expressed support for me despite still being in her ED, but also talk at length about how people want her to be 120 lbs and how disgusting that would be (we are the same height). At one point she looked me dead in the face and said \"We both want recovery,  of course. But we don't really. We want to be thin and svelte and erudite. That's what we really want.\" And it struck me because she was right. I wanted to look like her (she said she was 109 and losing). I want to have what i had when I was thin back. So I stopped eating for the rest of the day. I didn't realize how much I didn't actually want recovery until now. But now all of that work looks like a massive waste of time.

I was already thin, and though I didn\u2019t lose much weight, I grew a few inches. I liked looking thin, seeing my ribs and collarbones, having a thigh gap, being able to wrap my hands are my thigh, etc. It was also prime time for \u201cbutterfly anas\u201d on Instagram, so Baby Me made a secret account to post bodychecks, \u201cana tips,\u201d and other ~edgy~ bullshit. Anyways, after a few months of having this account, a grown man messaged me. He told me he was an \u201cana coach,\u201d and that he could make me a diet and exercise plan and hold me accountable to my goals (Not in those words, but that was the gist of it). As part of his coaching, he demanded daily bodycheck pictures. He\u2019d ask me for all different angles \u2014 standing, facing forward, not sucking in; standing, facing forward, sucking in; standing, facing sideways, not sucking in; standing facing sideways, sucking in; laying on my back, from above, not sucking in; laying on my back, from above, sucking in; laying on my back, from the side, not sucking in; laying on my back, from the side, sucking in; standing, legs from the front, hips relaxed; standing, legs from the side, hips relaxed; standing, legs from the front, hips rotated to force a bigger thigh gap. It was a lot, but I was diligent in taking and sending these pictures to him every day. In return, he\u2019d tell me how beautiful and lovely I was, how good I was looking, how well I was restricting, how I was doing such a good job. I was a middle school girl with cripplingly low self esteem, so the positive male attention was something I lapped right up. After a while, the requests got weirder and more specific. He wanted pictures more focused on my butt, because I \u201ccarried a lot of fat there.\u201d He wanted me to take my bra and underwear off for the pictures so he could \u201csee my ribs and hipbones better.\u201d He wanted me to take pictures of my hips, looking down my underwear, \u201cjust to show off my hip bridge.\u201d As I said before, my low self esteem made it impossible to stop. The validation I received was too good to pass up. This went on for at least a year before my parents eventually discovered that I had a secret eating disorder account (without knowing any of the details) and made me delete it. I\u2019m not sure why I thought of this today, nearly 10 years later, but I\u2019m terrified that the man I now know to be this massive creep preying on vulnerable, mentally ill little girls still has these pictures of me. Or worse, they\u2019re floating around somewhere as kiddie porn, which is making me sick to my stomach to think about.\n\nBless your soul if you read this whole mess \ud83d\ude05\ud83d\ude05", "subreddit": "EDAnonymous"}
