When you're lonely you can watch shows where the guy gets the girl in the end or vice versa. You enjoy it and it makes you happy feeling like that could happen to you sometime. You imagine yourself in their shoes and experience it as if you're going through it.\n\nHowever knowing you're accepting being alone is an all together different feeling. When you watch shows like that you can get extremely sick to your stomach or your thoughts race unconditionally. Because you know you're not going to have that, not today, tomorrow, next week or maybe not even in a year. You end up being against them coming together because even when it's fake, they have what you're not going to have.\n\nIf you feel the latter way, I get exactly how you feel and I'm here for you. If you feel the former, I encourage you to keep pressing on and continue with that positive (hope) because when it dies, it's gone.", "subreddit": "lonely"}

Compound that with other issues like lack of trust, poor social skills, and anxiety or depression, and its really checkmate for ever being able to escape.  \n\nEdit: disabilities and appearances, and health issues too. \n\nFrom wiki: Learned helplessness is behaviour exhibited by a subject after enduring repeated aversive stimuli beyond their control. It was initially thought to be caused from the subject's acceptance of their powerlessness: discontinuing attempts to escape or avoid the aversive stimulus, even when such alternatives are unambiguously presented. Upon exhibiting such behavior, the subject was said to have acquired learned helplessness. Over the past few decades, neuroscience has provided insight into learned helplessness and shown that the original theory actually had it backwards: the brain's default state is to assume that control is not present, and the presence of \"helpfulness\" is what is actually learned.\n\nIn humans, learned helplessness is related to the concept of self-efficacy, the individual's belief in their innate ability to achieve goals. Learned helplessness theory is the view that clinical depression and related mental illnesses may result from such real or perceived absence of control over the outcome of a situation.", "subreddit": "ForeverAlone"}

I had my heart broken by my first love, who moved away. No fights, no closure. Just one weeks\u2019 notice. My world shattered that day, and I try to remember those feelings. Those feelings I was told symbolized depression. \n\n\u201cDid they feel like this? Where they this HEAVY?\u201d\n\nI can\u2019t remember. It\u2019s been twenty years now, nostalgia has washed the negative feelings away and I am left with just the positive memories. Even after I waited for her, followed her to her new town after graduation, and was rejected. She had someone new. I don\u2019t remember those feelings either. I feel like they should be similar. I need a reference. I need a reference to see if these feelings will go away like they did then. \n\nI thinks that\u2019s about the time that I began referring myself as a \u201cpessimistic optimist\u201d. I don\u2019t think I put it into words until much later. But the jist of it is: *hope that things will be good, but realize that everything sucks and I should expect it to be this way,* \n\nI\u2019ve had a fucked up life. But I suppose everyone has. I was molested when I was very young, which has given me an odd complex about my sexuality. It\u2019s been that way for as long as I can remember. I\u2019ve never told anyone about what effects it had on me. No one. But it\u2019s been in the back of my mind all my life. I even conducted an experiment in college to confirm or deny the suggestions that my mind had been raising since I was young. And I got a resounding no. Good right? Question answered. Not quite. While I know I\u2019m not gay or bi, I\u2019m something else. Someone ruined me. I like being a man, and I am attracted to women, and I am definitely not attracted to men. \n\nI think it was my first love that wiped those feelings away. She erased all the questions. Those confusing feelings were gone.  Losing her brought all those feelings back. Not feeling whole, not feeling complete, being alone. The loss of feeling whole made my questions resurface. I tried to get rid of those feelings by seeing if that was what I really wanted, and it the answer to that was no. \n\nI think since then I\u2019ve chased her. Not her specifically but the feelings she gave me. The way she made feel like everything was ok. Because of this I have done some bad things. I would think of ways to make myself feel that way. But it never lasted. I have told every girl I\u2019ve ever been in a relationship with that I Ioved them. Every single one. Never right off the bat but it did always happen eventually. I would always try to push relationships to that next level just to feel it again. And by doing this I have hurt people. Once I get to a certain point in a relationship I would say, \u201cIt\u2019s not working, I don\u2019t have those all-encompassing feelings of being complete. Guess I shouldn\u2019t waste anymore time then\u201d. I would become cold and break it off. Generally, much to their surprise, and heartbreak. I ran from one girl because she was too much like me. She didn\u2019t have the answers and had problems herself. I tried to help her, but I think I was interested in helping myself more.  One just wanted to be accepted for how she was. I accepted her, Wholly and completely, with no questions. But when those feelings never came to me I left. I\u2019ve done horrible things no one knows about, simply to chase those feelings. Some relationships lasted months, some years. They all ended the same way. Hoping that I\u2019ll catch those feelings, but expecting things not to work out and not being surprised when I don\u2019t ever feel that way. Being the pessimistic optimist.\n\nAs I start looking back, I begin to question things. I begin to doubt choices I\u2019ve made. I begin to re-open old wounds. Old wounds I thought were long healed.  These being compounded new pain. Not my pain, but the pain I have caused people. Pain I never considered and brushed off because it was  \u201dfor the best\u201d.  \n\nI begin the spiral downward. I\u2019ve never been happy with me. I try to cover it up with smiles and jokes. I work hard. The hardest I can to maintain appearances. No one can tell. Not at least that I can see .\n\nThese feelings don\u2019t make sense. Why NOW? Did I reach my limit of being able to repress things, and everything comes pouring out at once?  Other than these feelings, other things in my life have been a struggle. I have college degrees but no job. I found a love for teaching but that was taken away as well (through no fault of my own). I built a business from the ground up and am moderately successful. I have a wife, I have kids. We look happy. Why don\u2019t I ever feel it? I always feel like something is missing. I can never put my finger on it. But that has always been there. The feelings that she gave me never came back. No matter what I\u2019ve done, there\u2019s always something missing. And now it\u2019s started to weigh on me. And the weight is so heavy. \n\nI know, logically, I have it way better than most people. I\u2019m a logical person. I try to argue to myself everyday why I shouldn\u2019t feel this way. I\u2019ve been blessed. I really have. So many more people are worse off than you, I tell myself. But I\u2019ve been telling myself that for so many years that the logic in those arguments no longer resonate with me. \n\nI find myself working less and less, and thinking more and more. Almost digging out my innermost sins to prove to myself that I deserve to feel this way. It just seems those feelings, those perfect feelings, are getting farther and farther away. No matter what I do, they are never within reach, and only accelerate faster away from me. I\u2019ve given myself a hundered different paths to catch them, but none of them lead to where I want to go. Instead I\u2019m hurting myself more and more, and I can\u2019t seem to stop it. \n\nIt\u2019s been going this way since I asked myself that question six months ago. \n\nThe thoughts of death begin to occur around month 3. After 3 months of agonizing over all the choices I\u2019ve made. Over all the pain I\u2019ve caused. It\u2019s ironic really, I begin thinking about death around the same time my son is born.  \n\nThe thoughts of death have always kind of been there. It\u2019s obvious, because it the easy way. The little jokes. \u201cid rather be dead than\u2026\u2026\u201d, \u201cI wish I could just put a bullet right here\u201d. Quick, painless, relief. But those thoughts become less like jokes and more real as time goes on. The heavier my feelings get, the more it seems the easy way out is the way to go. I\u2019ve walked so many paths, I\u2019ve tried to give myself different ways out. I\u2019ve tried. I\u2019ve tried so hard. But I\u2019m tired. I\u2019m tired of chasing those feelings. I\u2019m tired of sinking and getting further away from them. There seems to be only so long I can reach for the carrot dangling in front of me before I give up. I don\u2019t want to make any more mistakes. I don\u2019t want to cause any more pain. I\u2019m so tired of working. I\u2019m tired of smiling. \n\nThis is not a suicide note. For the simple reason of logic. This one bit of logic stays with me while all others have failed to change my mind. If I leave, I will cause so much more pain than I already have. And I can\u2019t do that. I won\u2019t put my parents, kids, wife, friends through that. Now death just becomes a pleasant wish. I wish for the pain to be gone. I wish for these feelings to go away. I want to be light again. I am tired of the weight, the heaviness. I begin to hope accidents happen, or that I get sick. Because then it wouldn\u2019t be my fault. No one would blame themselves and they would get over me easier than they would if I took my own life. \n\nSo while I wait the day that I am light again, I start a new path. A confession. One thing I have never done before. One path I never walked. I am a fucked up person. I have a strong sense that I have always been that way. Be it from my childhood trauma or something else.  I have made terrible mistakes chasing silly feelings that amount to nothing. All the errors I\u2019ve made, all the pain I\u2019ve caused, all amount to nothing. I have so much anger in me that I lash out. Anger that I believe comes from never feeling right.  I\u2019m tired of feeling this way, but I resign to wait for death for the good of my family. Thoughts of death have replaced those special feelings. Death is the light at the end of the tunnel now. I hope I get there sooner than later. And I hope that this confession will be the new path I can take that will make the weight not so hard to bear as I get there.", "subreddit": "ForeverAlone"}

Some arguments are that things might turn around for them, and hanging out in a 'negative' place like this would make it harder for them to get successful.\n\nAll of these arguments make a lot of sense if you don't consider the fact that some of the biggest deal breakers for women, things like height and social competence, are often impeded by incurable conditions, like being born shorter than the average guy, being born with autism or some other socially disabling illness, or both.  I was diagnosed with aspergers when I was in middle school and I could already tell I was not on the right social trajectory from my peers.  And while I was eventually able to improve myself to the point to where I am able to hold a job and buy a house, it didn't change the fact that only 30% of men on the spectrum ever get married, and, being nearly 40 now, I am well on my way to being part of the 70% who failed at this part of life.  Being ugly thanks to a genetic condition I was diagnosed with in college didn't really help either - either way, it was a pretty safe prediction that I would end up FA, and I could say that even as a teenager pretty confidently.\n\nI actually enjoy hearing when some late-bloomer ends up escaping from here (as long as it isn't one of the FAKE success stories that often pop up here). It means that the kid was a false alarm and doesn't have to know the anguish of suffering a life that isn't really living. At the same time though, I acknowledge that many FAs who are half my age who know why they are FA and know it probably won't change have a good reason to identify with us.\n\nSo here's to you, my fellow youngster FAs.  I hope you are wrong about why you are here, but if you are in the same shoes I was 25 years ago, all I can give you are my sympathies.", "subreddit": "ForeverAlone"}

Great husband only he works out of state and tends to forget holidays that pertain to me (granted he works hard for myself &amp; our children and provide amenities I never had growing up!) &amp; is only home a few days a month.  I have some amazing kids. I try to do it all but battle depression a lot &amp; could clean much better than I do &amp; take care of myself better.  Relocated years ago far away from family (not that it\u2019d be any different if we lived closer they never checked on me to begin with when I raised our first child by myself in my early 20\u2019s while he worked off.) For a good 4-5 years I\u2019ve been somewhat putting myself out there in the \u201cmom\u201d zones trying to just make one good &amp; true friend. Just one adult soul on this earth that it would affect or would notice if I didn\u2019t exist on this earth. Someone that on their on free will invited me to do things with them or returned any favors I do for so many other people. I moved around a lot as a kid &amp; never had anyone I really considered a friend until my 10th grade year at a new high school. We don\u2019t live close (haven\u2019t since we were 21) &amp; rarely get time to even text. I have sisters, cousins, &amp; family but am not really close with them. I see all the grandparents watching their kids &amp; everyone making memories. They all seem to have normal lives together as a family without me &amp; friends of their own. My own mother will call (when she actually does) talk for 1-2 minutes (unless she\u2019s ranting &amp; venting clearing all her own thoughts out) &amp; the moment I start to say I\u2019m stressed out about or I\u2019m exhausted with or man I\u2019m lonely, I get cut off mid word with... \u201cWell, I was just calling to see how you were doing. I\u2019ll let you go you seem busy. Bye!\u201d Or cut me off to tell me something about my sister. I feel in my heart if I passed tomorrow there\u2019d be a lot of crocodile tears at my funeral for attention but otherwise my absence on this earth genuinely wouldn\u2019t affect their lives at all. My thing is the \u201cdrama\u201d &amp; \u201cgossip\u201d with adult women I find hard to connect with. So I end up being the one mom at the game or the one mom at the practice by herself because the incessant chatter of drama is draining for me. It\u2019s the same with family. I end up feeling like the black sheep &amp; it\u2019s exhausting because I\u2019d love to decompress &amp; tell my thoughts to someone. But I don\u2019t want the rest of the world knowing every detail later on in a switched up version out of someone else\u2019s mouth. I am socially &amp; characteristically empty. I am so far past lonely I don\u2019t even know what this is any more. I have spent so much time alone as an adult at this point (years) that when I get to be around people I get wore out quickly (even with my husband when he\u2019s home &amp; I love him more than anything he\u2019s great!) I love my husband &amp; my children. If we lived in a remote part of Alaska where I knew it was just us &amp; there just wasn\u2019t contact with other people it\u2019d be one thing. But, it\u2019s not. There are people all around. Family, so much family... Moms, so many moms... and no one sees me. Or they do &amp; I\u2019m just literally that unappealing to think of genuinely getting to know &amp; making a friend with. These people saw me pregnant, have said new child, juggle 4 back to back sports for older child - 2 of which coincided with each other, have mastitis twice, have a pleural effusion, &amp; breastfeed to 18 months for the new child, all on my own with hubs home like 8 days a month, &amp; LITERALLY NO ONE CARED! Nobody cared about me as a friend. I could really just use some prayers y\u2019all!

I also read how if you search for friends, you won't make any. However, not sure how true that is, I believe that if you set your mind on something, it will be attained. Not necessarily goal of \"make friends\", but a goal of \"be open, love everyone and meet people\". Then, friends come. But it's just messing with my head to think my happiness is dependent on relations. It's not like I'd be a clingy friend in any capacity, I workout daily, I meditate, eat healthy, my mind is strong as fuck and I can out-will anything, but I seriously just don't have any friends (I'm studying abroad, so my best friend is back home).\n3.

My local religious community decided to host a singles night and I went with friends in the hopes of at least making some new friends (in my profession 95% of the people I work with are women). There were 40 men at the event and 45 women. In typical speed dating fashion everyone was given a number - after meeting with everyone at the event you could write down as many numbers as you wanted (8-10 is the norm) and if you both wrote down each others' number then you were a 'match'.\n\nA week later we received the results. I got no matches, which was disappointing but fine - I was glad to have gone anyways. Then my friends started to call and tell me that 'hey I didn't get any matches but at least I know that six people wrote me down!' and similar. Wait...but...their messages said not only that there were no matches but ALSO how many people wrote them down?!?!\n\nFearing the worst but wanting to be optimistic I emailed the director of the event and point blank asked - does the fact that I didn't get that message mean that not a single man at the event even wrote my number down? Her reply? 'Yes. Exactly.\"\n\nWell, cut to a scene of me having a good old fashioned ugly cry at the thought of going to this event and out of forty people not even one of them wrote me down on their list of top choices...I decided to reach out to a trusted friend on the planning committee to let her know of my situation and how easy it was to deduce that no one had written me down. I asked if she could mention anonymously to the organizer that letting people know this info was probably not a good idea because it led to me deducing (as other people could) that not only did they have no matches...literally no one at the event picked them.\n\nWell, the next day I got an extremely long and angry email from the director accusing me of trying to sabotage the event, being the only complainer out of more than 80 attendees, and essentially not being Christian enough. It mocked my situation, told me that I completely devastated her, and that I should never have said anything. Turns out the person I trusted accidentally forwarded my message with my name attached.\n\nAnyways...Sorry for the long rant, I'm just feeling so defeated, lonely, unloveable, and alone. I feel like an utter failure and I could just really use a little encouragement :(\n\n(TL;DR - I went to a single's night and out of 40 men not only did I not match, no one even wrote me down as an option, and then I got an email ripping me a new one about it)", "subreddit": "lonely"}

I chose a bad title and I was still hung over and angry about the night before. I had to delete it. People got offended by it despite it being a mix of funny, sad, scary, warning to others.\n\nSo I went on a \"date\". She said she was looking for friends for now and outdoor activity partner. I also knew her (kind of). So I matched, sent a funny pic, took like 2 months for her to reply. We talked slowly at first but starting hitting it off good in the text messages. She kept suggesting we go meet for a walk. Didn't show up the first time which was ok because it was short notice. We rescheduled. Still didn't show up. I waited like an idiot. I asked her if I did/said something wrong.\n\nShe said no. Her apartment was unlivable atm so she was staying with a drunk guy. The cops were called because she claims to have knocked him out for messing with her. Big red flag.\n\nShe keeps messaging me and I'm out in town drinking in dark corners. Against my better judgement, I visited her at her place. Gave her something to get high from. Bad idea. She told me all about her drug problems and how she lost custody of her child and has to pay child support. She started crying and taking pills and drinking all the alcohol I brought. I'm thinking, RUNNN!!! I was also thinking how much of a bad influence I must be. I wanted to help her out of her hole. There is a good side to me but I can't help people that can't help themselves or won't get help.\n\nShe told me to meet her at a bar for some pool with a guy she probably got off tinder too. I was already out so again, like an idiot, went to the near by bar. That was a bad night. she started hitting on a young girl and brought her into the bathroom to probably eat her out. she went stupid after that. falling everywhere. falling into the street. I kept trying to pick her up before she got hit. She would fight back and tell me I'm a piece of shit and I'm a nobody, Grabs me out of the blue and makes out with me. I tasted the other girl... She shook her head and said no. Like she rather have the girl instead of me. I managed to get her home so she won't get hurt but she really cut into my soul and physically attacked me a little. Turns out she smoked fentenyl. That stuff turns people into demons.\n\nShe's still messaging me.... She just messaged me now. I don't know why I attract bad people. I'm just a good-looking for-my-age, average height white guy. I think I'm hexed.\n\nBeing lonely and single isn't so bad.

We'd been talking for a while, she got all my jokes and made plenty of her own, the conversations were invested in by both sides, and I thought we had a good thing going.\n\nSo with little planning, I asked her if she'd be up to go to the cinema with me. She asked if it was just as friends. I told her that I just wanted to get to know her more, and we could see about that afterwards. She told me that she doesn't like me like that, but would happily go as a group of friends.\n\nSo we got a group together, 2 of mine, 2 of hers, mostly mutual friends of ours and everyone knew at least 2 people who were going. We had it all arranged, dates, times, places, costs and what film we were going to see nailed down. She was in New York whilst we were planning it, so I stayed up past midnight every day to fill her in on the plans. It was all good to go.\n\nTwo days before we were due to go, she told me that she had suddenly had a family issue and couldn't come. I told her that her family was important and she didn't need to apologize, she said maybe we could reschedule. Because she didn't want to go, her two friends didn't want to go either \n\nMe and my two friends went without them, and had an ok time.\n\nAbout half a week later I tried to bring up the topic of rescheduling. She never saw it. I tried again a few days later, still no response.

Male, 63 years old:**    \nI figured a old man would be wise and experienced, able to see how people and relationships really work. Nope. His idea of romantic relationships was as if taken from the 1950's. At one point he advised me to \"ask a girl to the dance\". He also went on a tirade against tattos, saying women don't like men with tattos (lol) because women want men who are handsome like Clark Gable or Sean Connery. \n\n\n**Therapist 2. Female, ~50 years old:**    \nThis time I though I would be better off with a female perspective. Nope. She had a fundementalist belief in the \"no one will love you before you love yourself\" mantra despite the fact that she was a proof herself that her own advice wasn't true when she told me how she had been depressed and disliked herself until she met her husband who taught her to love herself and life. Uh, ok... \n\nMuch like my first therapist, she had absolutely no idea how dating apps like Tinder worked. In their minds, Tinder was pretty much the same as an food delivery app but for sex. They thought you would go on Tinder, swipe right on someone you liked and that person would then automatically show up at your doorstep. You would have sex without saying a word and then part ways, and any further contact would be optional. \n \n\n**Therapist 3. Female, 30-35 years old:**    \nMy reasoning was now that I needed someone younger, someone more in touch how people and relationships have changed. Nope. She was a clueless, spoiled child when it came to relationships,  a modern version of Marie Antoinette saying \"why won't they eat cake?\". For example, we were talking about going out to bars, clubs and such. She questioned why I hadn't slept with a woman from a bar. As she continued talking her perspective became clear: to her, --an attractive woman-- going out was synonomous with being hit on by several people. Her experience was that you would automatically have several opportunities to hook up when going out. She couldn't wrap her head around the fact that this is only true for women and extremely few men. She eventually conceded that it was harder for men since they almost always had to make the first move, but she still couldn't accept that some (most?) men are always rejected.\nOh, and as a bonus: she protested against my complaint that it's always the men who make the first move with the example of the SINGLE TIME IN HER LIFE she had made the first move: she had hit on a guy... who was a famous elite athlete. Yeah.\n\n\n**Therapist 4. Female, 40 years old:**    \nA lesbian and/or possibly asexual who had grown up in a cult and probably had some kind of Aspberger. At least she was interesting. Our time was cut short because she decided she wanted to work with teenagers instead and implied it was because it wasn't too late for them, unlike for me. Gee, thanks.

The other two girls in the group were mean to me, but if one of them insulted me she would tell them to stop. I tried to make small-talk with the other group members but nobody else really enjoyed talking to me except for her. When I would tell jokes that probably weren't funny anyways, she would be the only one to laugh. I remember in particular telling one joke (A variation of \"They see me rolling\") and nobody else thought it funny but she burst out laughing the moment I said it. Another time, we were seated in a room on a set of couches and I went to sit on the loveseat, but she said \"You can sit here, though\" pointing beside her and asked me to sit beside her. A couple of times when I was in her presence I noticed she would start breathing more deeply when I was passing by, and when I was blocking a projector during a mock rehearsal for the presentation we would be doing the following week, she touched my arm as she indicated that I would be blocking the view. It was the first time in about 2 years that I had been touched by a woman.\n\nI wonder whether she liked me; I never got to ask her out, the opportunity didn't present itself because we only saw each other in the group meetings when the others were present.

In this picture you can see me from my side profile and for some reason that I can't seem to pin point, photos just capturing the right side of my face look a looot better, I think its because my nose. I can pass off as kind of cute from my right side even tho I am still ugly as hell, in fact whenever I take a photo of myself I always try to just show  the right side of my face from a side view perspective.\n\nWell apparently my dad noticed this as well and commented \"Wow you look a lot better from your profile than from a frontal view\". That comment confirmed all my fears, it isn't all in my head, my dad on top of everyone also thinks that I am ugly. I have always secretly resented my dad because he used to be incredibly good looking  and has had it pretty easy in life as a result .I always get really jealous when he tells me about fun stories from his past (which usually involve girls )  because they make me realize on how much in life I am missing out on just because of my appearance and how many things I will never get to experience. He also constantly asks me why I don't have a girlfriend yet, which makes me furious inside because it is apparent that I am below average and its not as easy as it was for him. I look nothing like him, I look like a male version of my mother and I know its messed up to say this and all because I love her so much but I also secretly resent her because of the way I turned out looks wise.\n\nI am just tired of being alone, I'm tired of girls looking at me in disgust, being ugly makes life so much harder.

I managed to make it all the way to Monterey before I decided it would be a good idea to head back.  Overall, the trip was cool because I got to check out the Half Moon Bay Pumpkin Festival, which I had never visited before, and checked out the Aquarium, along with a kickass ice cream place in Monterey that I never knew about before (anyone who goes there, check out Revival Ice Cream and check out the Bees Knees flavor, it kicks ass).\n\nThis may seem like a bullshit post that's out of place in a place like the FA boards, but the reason I am telling this story is because I asked my only two friends to come with me on this trip and both declined.  I felt it would have been nice to have people to talk to during this short trip, but both of them declined stating that they had other things to do, mostly involving their spouses and/or families.\n\nTo me, this was bittersweet for two reasons.  On the plus side, I was glad that I didn't have to check in with anyone to go on this trip, unlike my friends.  Both of them had obligations related to family friends or to their own spouses to do domestic chores that had to be honored, and as a result, didn't go on a trip that probably would have been fun for them.  Meanwhile, I just packed up and went without worrying about pissing someone off or ignoring people I am supposed to care about.\n\nOn the other hand, it did remind me that, as a nearly 40 year old man, I didn't have the same life experience as people who were around my age.  While most normal folks had important obligations related to their spouses, it reminded me that I've never really had a girlfriend, much less a spouse, and that it would be unlikely I'd ever be able to hang out with my friends on the same level simply because we are at different stages of life.  I already don't see them that often anymore because they are either working or doing family stuff, and I am sure once they start having kids, I won't see them at all.\n\nOverall, I still recommend getting out there and checking out the world.

I wasn't always lonely, you see. During College and University, I had enough friends take my mind off the loneliness and depression (which began when I was 7 years old). After University, having a break up and getting a job, things have taken for a downhill turn. I find myself so alone, even though it has been 4 years since University and Break up, and I never thought it would affect me this much. To tell you all the truth, I prefer being alone, but lately this feeling is scrambling my mind. I tried dating sites, Tinder and what not, just to have some form of emotional connection. But, never succeeded. My problem was that people didn't take that initiative to actually get to know me, whereas here I was trying my best to know about them. Some would only reply when I asked them a question and it would naturally be a one-word answer or if I was lucky, a sentence. And after going through so much in life since childhood (and I have been through some dark shit, believe me), my heart tells me you have done enough sacrifices as it is, don't waste anymore of your time. Now, all that has become of my life is \"Get up. Go to work. Come home. Play video games. Watch movies and TV series. Go to sleep. Repeat\". I won't say I am a good person, but I will say I have gone above and beyond when someone needed my help. Now, all that remains with me is the darkness, and here I am at the age of 25. What I am afraid of most is finding no one at the end of my life.

I've never been the most social person, so I went through most of high school tending to myself up until my senior year where I got really close to a great group of friends that I still keep in touch with. I share a true intimate connection with these people that I never even knew could exist, and now that we've gone off to college and parted ways, I am realizing how vital that constant social interaction has become to my mental health. One of those friends, my best friend actually, does attend the same school as me, but they're in ROTC and have found a new social group around that and other clubs they've joined. We do hang out every once in a while, but the time between hangouts seems to be getting longer and longer. I know they deeply care for me, just as I care for them, but not seeing the one person I have left still sucks. Quality bonding time is something I don't experience anymore and need back very soon.\n\nMost of my days here are eaten up by studying, working out (this helps keep me afloat) or working, so even if I did have the social initiative to go out and meet people, the time I have to do that is very minimal. Besides, I definitely do not fit in well with party culture, which pervades through the entire student body, as it seems. So many people here glorify drugs and alcohol and hooking up with strangers, it's disgusting (welcome to college life I guess). Sure, I'll drink if invited, but I cannot stand the way so many people use substance abuse as a personality trait or a hobby. I'm just not into that. I've made a couple acquaintances at work, and they're really friendly and I enjoy their company, but we don't ever hang out outside of work. Not even having the chance to form a strong emotional bond with someone, whether it be my lack of initiative or their disinterest, sucks fat penis. Outside of work, I haven't met too many people. I actually have zero people I would consider friends and my self esteem does not like that. I tried introducing myself to people in my classes the first couple weeks of class, but no one seemed to care so I just stopped trying. \n\nI'm at a point where I have no idea what to do. I know I have to do something in order to change this, but my current situation and approach to social life have me floundering. I walk around campus between classes and I see people walking together and talking or holding hands and it just makes me want to listen to Blonde on repeat (which I subsequently do). I'm a sad, lonesome, sack of shit, to put it bluntly, and it's eating me up inside. I'm pretty reserved, so I may not display it on the outside, but then again there isn't anyone around to notice, anyways.\n\nThis feeling of loneliness is fucking awful and I want it to end right now. I don't know how much longer I can stand it. But I feel like this is my fault for not having no initiative. Or have I negated my chances of finding a good social circle by being consumed in my own everyday life? I don't fucking know, but I guess I have to figure it out myself. I wish I could go back to old me that didn't know what emotional connections were and be happy with the life I'm leading and not are about my lack of a social life.\n\nIf you read through this jargon, I appreciate you with the core of my being and cannot thank you enough.

Augmented by time, and acceleration of the distance between you and your true desires.\n\nThe world is in utter chaos. Sexuality has been greatly distorted, disturbed, and distributed to a species on the downfall. Using the beauty of life itself as a commodity to relieve the insecure and  perpetually feed the maggots that eat away at love\u2019s degradation.\n\nLove had a special and specific art to its initiation. It was graceful, timeless, encapsulating, inspiring, gentle, and most of all private(sacred, even). Somewhere, along the line, these human creatures forgot how the hell to reinforce, replicate, and refine this way of life and settled for cheap smut.\n\nAnd yet, the smut is and was incredibly effective. Why try anymore? Some jackasses in Hollywood figured out how to appeal to the ancient mind set of affection, pimped, and perverted it to hell and back. Go try that shit out! Why not go for the convenient formula for a synthetic lifestyle? Let\u2019s live a little and die slowly inside. After all, we don\u2019t really know any better than those high status machines, now do we?\n\nAll the clothing, all the films and music, all the things to put sex over basic humanity first. Free will is a free market. Adults are the employees and the children are the consumers demanding more and more. These kids will perfect and advance this hell of sexual exploitation and deviancy because it\u2019s the most powerful and rewarding influence on them.\n\nHell, and those same adults are influential amongst their own age group as well. The parties, the vanity, the one night stands, the drama, and the revenge are all on one convenient place. The online armada of distorted mentality. Their gods with the big titties thick thighs and sweaty booties with verified accounts are so close they can almost get a taste of it. \n\nWell, don\u2019t get the wrong idea, that body\u2019s not for sale just the premium private show on her live stream is. But don\u2019t be too sad, you can be just like them with an app and a bio so transparent and shallow it\u2019s hard to read with the swarm of mosquito larvae surrounding it, jacking off endlessly until they drop dead from the excitement of following such an inspiring specimen with so many overblown assets they had to save the rest of it on an external hard drive only two people know about (you and the e-celebrity). \n\nAnd that looks like love to so many of you today. That hideously pretentious run on sentence about current dating and hyper sexual culture of a diseased generation resembles a promising future for millions of you out there. But, it gets so much worse than that, and no healthy or rational person would want to live that way. So what the hell happened? Why are there so many people fucking up how you\u2019re supposed to have happy relationships while the rest of you are forgotten about, rotting away wondering who could even love you for who you are?  \n\nSimple,... I don\u2019t fucking know! \n\nBut I\u2019ve seen what humanity is capable of, I\u2019ve seen what we\u2019re subjected to, I\u2019ve been on the receiving and active end of at least some of that hell. So I do know I have some sense to say that this isn\u2019t at all how life is supposed to be! At least, it shouldn\u2019t be this bad.\n\nThe convenience of growing addicted to all the wrong things has proven to be so much more effective than upholding the proclivity of what love truly is. I hate watching people trade their heart and souls in for the cheap glory of being seen and utilized as a living sex toy advertisement.\n\nI could give a damn who wants to stick up for these people\u2019s vile behavior. There\u2019s certain things that can\u2019t be excused. Not when so much is on the line, not when you can be so much more.

You\u2019ve had your fun, now is time to get your shit together like you\u2019re life depends on it.\n\nSo ... I as I\u2019ve said before, this will be our greatest war. This battle between thrills and up holding principles will be the real deal breaker for the course of life on Earth. \n\nWho\u2019s won you over on their side? You wanna build or burn out?

I'm a little scared what would happen if someone were to walk into the room right now.\n\nAlright so carrying on with the story, I celebrated my birthday once, when I was very young and my parents threw out a party at a hotel, to which no one from my school was invited, and now that I think of it, it was probably a way for them to network with the people they did invite. What generally happens on my birthdays is that we end up at 8 o'clock with a small cake on the dining table because we don't like cakes with the 5 of us around it and that's my bash. So you see, I don't really look forward to my birthdays. The only good thing that happens is that my mother comes to my room at midnight and she wishes me a happy birthday. That's kinda nice. But lately I've been thinking that that's something she just has to do because I'm her son, so like yeah.\n\nBut this birthday was supposed to be special, you see I'm turning 18 tomorrow, and I'd decided a few months ago that by then I'd go out and make good friends. I'd throw a big party and invite everyone and it'd be great. As you can probably guess that's not happening. So like, yay 18th birthday finally an adult. Happy birthday to me.", "subreddit": "lonely"}

They both had really long shifts, so many nights would be McDonalds, Taco Bell, BurgerKing, Panda Express etc. \nIn Elementary school however, I was actually a pretty active kid, so some years it balanced out more than others. Still people did sometimes make fat jokes, and just be rude in general. In middle school however, there there always people who called me fat, foodface, the more Chins than Chinatown joke, and jokes about me walking, despite only being about 15-30lbs overweight and being a nice kid to everyone all of the time. \nI didn't care that much, despite being insecure I began to realize these opinions are coming from people who don't know much better. So instead of P.E. I switched to band, and I quite frankly loved it, it was the only subject where people didn't seem to care about my weight, or other features and instead cared about how well I could play. All of my first ~3 friends were band kids. Mainly because nobody valued me before. By the end of middle school I was beginning to lose some weight, realizing that my habits are not good. I was extremely insecure like many middle school kids. \n\nBut there was this girl in band I liked, not popular, very nice, really smart and actually asked me stuff about how my day was, etc. I somehow got the confidence to ask her, if she wanted to go to the movies over the weekend.

I just said \"Ok\" and left. \n\nBut holy shit thankfully that was the last class because I went home and fucking cried for probably a couple days, missed school, and didn't talk to anyone when I came back for a couple more days.

I tried to make myself someone else who other people would find fun and it worked for a while. My grades and overall wellbeing suffered, though.

I have social anxiety and I\u2019ve made zero friends. When I first moved in I had two roommates in a buildup room that never seemed to really like me and excluded me. They also moved my stuff around without asking when I went home one weekend which really pissed me off and constantly had their loud friends in our very cramped room. When our buildup got broken down in the middle of September, they started listing reasons why I should be the one to move out, so I did. My new roommate has been a nightmare to deal with (blasting music, setting multiple alarms in the morning for no reason, etc.) despite me repeatedly asking her to stop. She also tells me she\u2019ll invite me to go somewhere with her friends and then leaves and never comes back until like 2 am. She also annoys me when she comes in drunk or high if I\u2019m awake. Like I don\u2019t care if you party, just don\u2019t annoy me when you come back. I lost my shit with her when I was sleeping and she came in high at 1:30 am and woke me up by turning the light on, blasting and singing to music and slamming the microwave when I had to get up early that morning to take a train home. She\u2019s just unbelievably rude.\n\nEveryone I met in the first couple weeks of school I just didn\u2019t connect with at all, and now I spend all my free time in my dorm. It\u2019s horrible.

I\u2019ve always been a more quiet person that didn\u2019t socialize too much, but that doesn\u2019t mean I wouldn\u2019t like some friends that I can do stuff with. Anyway. Point being. Does anyone know of a way I can make some friends in a new place?", "subreddit": "lonely"}

Academically I'm doing well, as I spent most of my time trying to make up where I lacked up in high school.  I've started actually hitting the books and pulling pretty good midterm grades. However, when I was struggling with my lab on Halloween, I've realized how incredibly lonely I am here. During the lab, all I could do was wait for some reaction to happen, and I just there and thought about how I can't talk to people here or make friends as I did in high school. I'm just so flabbergasted, as in high school I felt like I could talk to people easily. I had so many friends in high school, but the roughest transition of college is creating a social life. I've started making jokes about it with my friends from h.s saying that my G.P.A is pretty happy because of my dead social life, saying stuff like \"friends are temporary, G.P.A is forever\". Anyways I can talk to people in my hall, but I feel like everyone here just think I'm just a tryhard in academics (which is partially true). Everyone here is just so socially adept, I feel like a fish out of water. On the first-week people made their own clicks, and I'm here in awe how fast people made these friendships. I've decided to join some clubs to meet people. Despite joining a club that feels like a family, sometimes I feel like an outsider most of the time. Everyone there feels like they've been friends for years, and even the other new members hit it off pretty off well with the veterans in the club. I'm here just feeling left out. I feel like I'm invisible to a lot of people. It's just scary to be by yourself and you isolate yourself through your head. I remember just crying after my lab, all by myself at the engineering building. I just want to cry right now, all to myself. It just feels like I'm just wasting people's oxygen.  Other people on this subreddit probably has it worse than me. I don't know why I think my problems and feelings have any weight. Anyways sorry for rambling about this.

My roommates (male and female) are a couple I've been good friends with since high school. We're all in our early 20's, and they've been dating for almost 4 years. I have never had a serious girlfriend or been in a serious relationship.\n\nSince this semester started I've been feeling trapped living with them. I do not have a crush on the girl I live with and I am not jealous of the guy. I am jealous of what they have. Every day I live with them it makes me feel alone and sad. Most days I come home from school they're on the couch cuddling, making inside jokes to each other, touching each other, and doing couple stuff. Besides for some quick kisses they don't engage in PDA in front of me, which helps, but it still sucks. I know they don't mean to make me feel bad, but it is just starting to hurt. I'm tired of being the third wheel. It wasn't really that bad until this semester. I've been trying to get a girlfriend for a long time, but I'm realizing it's probably not in the cards for me. I'm not jealous of my roommate, but I still want something in my life. Pretty much every one in my life is in a relationship except for me, and having to come home to it everyday is getting really painful.\n\nThe worst part is they barely ever leave home. They're basically always there and our place is very small (basically just a living room and 2 bedrooms), so I can't leave my room without seeing them. Hanging out with them is becoming a bit uncomfortable for me. They will make little side jokes to each other or do little couple things and I just have to stand there and take it. I'm already a socially awkward person, so it's really difficult for me to not be awkward around them when they do this stuff. I know it's not their fault and they don't mean for it to be this way, but it's starting to reach a boiling point with me. They're great people and I have nothing against them, but I need a solution before it gets any worse.

The day was fun, i spent it with my family, but the occasion just throws me into depression and makes me think about being alone so much more than usual. I'm at university now, most people would consider that a positive but socially it's just reminded me how inept at forming relationships I am. Every single night i can hear the sounds of bluetooth speaker and drunken shouting from the kitchen and i would love nothing more than to be able to integrate myself. Yet every time I try the same exact thing happens, i end up drinking alone leaning in a corner reading reddit or twitter, while i watch like 10 guys thirst over 2 girls, and see everyone else smoking and laughing and having fun. \n\nAnd these people are always reminding me that i'm a failure in intimate relationships too. Some guys talk about their long term girlfriends and are always saying what they've done, what dates they've had and when they are seeing them again. And the other half are the hookups type, talking about who they met in a club and took home, or whos place they went back to. And of course, they have sex in all these stories. I'm so envious of how everyone else around me can just effortlessly do things like this, even if some of it is just drunken one nighters. I'd give my fucking right arm just for any kind of human intimacy at this point. I've never been with anyone seriously in my whole life. \n\nI did have one person who i thought was perfect. It's a long and painful story. To this day the only person i've ever felt any form of attraction to. It's been a year since we stopped talking and not a day goes by when i'm not reminded of it.\n\nI'm not 'gamer' enough to be in the gamer group. I'm not 'nerdy' enough to be in the nerd group\nI'm not social enough to be in the social group\nI'm not quiet enough to be in the quiet group\nI'm not LGBT enough to be in the LGBT group\n\nI just feel as if i'm destined to be alone forever, until i lose it and break the locks on my 3rd floor window. And i hate the feeling so much. I don't want to climb these mountains by myself anymore. I don't want to fight my battles alone any more but i know i always will. I'm not the type of person anyone likes, not really. I'm the type of person who gets the \"if we're both 30\" pact. The \"last resort\" man. The \"I'll date you in 10 years when i've finished with the dick roulette\" type of guy.\n\nI feel if the time ever comes i'll be so useless and inexperienced that it won't last longer than a week. Nobody wants the burden of being somebody's first, especially if that somebody is a fat greasy borderline Incel like me. I used to have fantasies of meeting the perfect person. We would both be just the same and we could learn together and everything would be great. Yet every day the realities of life become more obvious. I'll end as just another male suicide statistic in the newspaper. Perhaps the best i could hope for is a handful of praying emoji from boomer mums under a local radio facebook post. \n\nIt just all feels so pointless sometimes. I would kill  not to feel this way any more, just to get out of this mindset because i know it's only ever going to be a downward spiral if I can't start thinking right.

My sister and I were adopted by the same couple, ( we share a biological  mother) and she  has loathed me since I was a child. I've never had a strong relationship with my father because of abuse he went through himself as a kid, his heavy drinking problems, and his general disinterest with the world around him. While I love my mother, she is a broken woman in a loveless marriage, with nearly two decades of health problems and dysfunctional family issues wearing her down to a point of constant anxiety and stress, which she took out on my sister and I as children. At first things were fine in my family when it was just them and my sister, and then I was born unexpectedly, and taken in by my mother. Ever since then it seems like our dynamic has become more and more unstable, to the point where I no longer speak with my sister due to her severe anger management issues, and my father's general  disinterest in me. I'm barely in contact with my mother.   \n\n\nI'm a college student about to graduate, and I barely feel like I've mastered the skills to be thrust into the world on my own. I have a crippling marijuana addiction that I've gotten help for countless times, support communities and groups, therapists and psychiatrists, I've talked it over with friends and lovers, but no matter what I can't shake it. Weed is the only thing that makes me feel even remotely calm enough to take on the world. But its destroying my life, I've fallen so far behind in school due to my anxiety and fear. I just spend my days ambling around my house cleaning and organizing so I feel like I'm doing something productive. I'm reaching a breaking point, if I don't catch up on certain projects by winter break, I won't graduate.   \n\n\nI've already taken a semester off for mental health reasons when I was suicidal sophomore year. I'm already a year behind my original graduation date. My father does not support my education, my mother has been paying out of pocket to help me attend a very expensive art school which was my dream reach school when I was younger. She's on social security, and Im bleeding her dry. All while Im wasting time procrastinating and being stressed when I should just work.   \n\n\nI got a girlfriend a little over a year ago. She quickly figured out I was a pot head with no self control. At first she tried to help, but when I made it clear that I couldn't stop she gave up trying to help me. I dragged her through month after month of promises. Sometimes I kept them and stopped, sometimes I gave in went behind her back. She knew every time, she said she felt like an idiot for believing me. My stress from smoking too much pot, and then becoming overwhelmed with school, just to barely scratch by has been my cycle every semester. She has many of the same issues I have with our family and social anxiety, but seeing me so off the rails not only upset her, but also impacted her own school work.   \n\n\n I just found out earlier this week that she cheated on me. I dont know how many times or with how many people, but I know she's hung out with her old tinder-buddies before, and that she met with a girl off reddit specifically for sex. I was devastated, but not surprised. I knew she wasn't happy.   \n\n\nWhen I confronted her she said she had given up on trying to open up to me for over half a year, that she felt like she couldn't trust me, and that I didn't care for her anymore.   \n\n\nOn top of this my mom hasn't been able to make the last three payments on my tuition bill. If they don't get paid I cant register for next semester.   \n\n\nI'm behind on my major thesis project, I have no family, I might not be able to finish school, I'm not good anything but art, my girlfriend just broke up with me, and I have nothing for my peace of mind except weed, which is largely why I'm in this situation to begin with.   \n\n\nIm so out of options, I just need someone else to know the truth that I'm a mess and scared and have no idea if im strong enough to overcome this.   \n\n\nThanks for listening Reddit, its good just to type this out.", "subreddit": "lonely"}

Warning: Positivity Trigger", "author": "2tonpun", "self_text": "You can't keep a negative head space and expect different results. You need to find something that will give you confidence. When I say confidence I don't mean the outward display of aggressiveness or \"I don't care\" attitude that people think. I mean the positive head space that has been reinforced by real world results in something... something important to you. This head space is the kind that makes you see life as an adventure. \n\nHow can you achieve this when you feel like a failure? The answer is simple but not easy. You must stop seeing a lack of dating as a sign of failure, and instead allow yourself to become excited by other things. Notice that last sentence. By freeing up your mind from negativity, you allow your mind to rest. And when you rest, you'll feel like you did after a good night's sleep and wake up in the morning: refreshed and excited. Your negativity right now, it's saturating your life whether you notice it or not. Even in the things that are good, they'll never feel as good as they could because your mind is hanging on to shame.\n\nNegativity has probably been your default for as long as you can remember. It's followed you wherever you go and because we humans can't separate our emotions from our sense of awareness, you can only see metaphorical darkness. You may think you're rational, seeing only the truth that optimism hides. But the truth is you're only seeing part of reality. You're seeing the reality that is saturated with your view point of life, which itself is saturated in negativity. With a positive mind set, you must believe me that you would see a completely different reality, one that is invisible to your negative self. *One that is invisible to yourself right this instant*\n\nIf you allow it, negativity will continue to rule your mind. You will see yourself as a victim, hopeless and powerless. But you can become something different. You can completely change your understanding of the world and your life. By adopting a positive mind, making it your default, you will never see life in the same way. You will see reality saturated in a positive field of view, whether that is or good or bad *or far from the truth* (which if you're rational won't happen) it won't matter. All that will matter is you will feel confident and that confidence will be real and substantial and you can actually feel happy and content.\n\n This is why positivity has to be your default. This is why you must fight your negativity by exerting yourself in something that is hard and winning. After all, positivity has to come from somewhere. It doesn't have to be dating. It can be wood working, it can piano, programming, guitar, running, your career. That's where it starts. When you sweat, when you pour your yourself into something and get better and see the fruit of your hard work, you will begin to feel hopeful. If you can keep up that attitude .........\n\n\n**You will put on a pair of goggles that will give you *super vision*.

The thing is, this particular friend (who I guess was never a friend since he blocked me) says things like, \"don't they tell you anything about texting at work?\" or \"Do you text anyone as much as you text me?\" It made me think that I was bothering him, so I said so. We ended up getting into a fight about that and he blocked me. It hurt me because I've been losing a lot of friends lately, or they just haven't seemed that interested in talking to me. I used all of my data, so I can't really go online and find new people to talk to while at work (my job doesn't even have wifi). I don't know what to do.", "subreddit": "lonely"}

I mean, I happen to like a healthy figure (I am a big fan of boobs but it can vary with body type), it has less to do with a super model frame and more of something that perfectly fits who the girl is. I like someone who\u2019s beauty comes out in subtle ways.  \n\nA girl who can use makeup sparingly but can have a blast with accessories to fit the occasion or whatever her mood happens to be. I can see her dressing and changing her hair to match the seasons, like she would go all out for Halloween and Christmas. I would like it if she were creatively inclined. I'd imagine she'd be a little more outgoing than me, but not severely, just enough to balance us out. \n\nA dumb sense of humor like mine, but a girl who can contribute to deeper conversations. Perfect communication is a must. I don't know what personality type I'd like the best though, because I've never gotten to know any of the many I do like well enough to pick favorites. \n\nBubbly or optimistic is nice, I like the shyer type, I like the cool girls, sarcastic type, punk, goth, \"girl next door\" type, studious type (with the cute glasses, the cute bangs, with an updo or pony tail), nerdy type, serious secretary type (well put together, but she has a thing for my unorthodox nature), the weirdo, the princess, the sweetheart, the otaku, the gamer, the outcast, the musician, the cook, the dancer, the singer, the athlete, the fashionista, the slacker, the dreamer, the hottie, the beauty, the cutie, the pervert, the artist, the laid back, the reserved type, the clever type, the geek, the just about any girl you can come up with I will have a thing for her as long as she's not boring, a bitch, an idiot, or dresses like a hooker. The company she keeps is another thing I'd keep account of, plus I'm also straight edge and can make a shit ton of really good vegan meals, but other than that I just fucking love girls! \n\nSo because of all that, I have a hard time picturing a specific girl I'd love to be with since she could be just about anyone. But what might constrict it a bit would be that I don't like alcohol or eat meat, but most women prefer to be on the healthier side anyways so it might not be a big deal. \n\nI eat vegan, but my personality isn't what you'd imagine a vegan to be like at all. Although, metaphysics is a deep interest of mine, but that's mainly because I see art as a more accurate depiction of reality than anything. But on the less serious side, my sense of humor was shaped by early [adult swim] and the Simpsons, and my music taste is mostly metal. Those are just the bigger specifics about myself. \n\nSide note: I find it weird how the longer I go without a girl in my life on any level, I start bringing out more feminine feelings and ideas to the surface. It\u2019s like I\u2019m compensating their absence. Writing this post felt a lot like a little girl reminiscing over the dream boat she wants to merry when she grows up. I don\u2019t like that, even the shows I watch have gotten girlier. \n\nBut it\u2019s completely fair if someone gets the wrong idea about me, because I technically have no proof I\u2019m straight.", "subreddit": "ForeverAlone"}

Prior to this year, my sister was the biggest social butterfly. Everyone in our high school knew her. She was friends with everyone. She is also very cute so she had a lot of attention as well. Anyways, this year a lot happened. To her and our family in general. She lost a lot of close friends (i feel bad cause some of them betrayed her). However, a lot of the friends she had were not good ones. She was not making the best choices and was hanging with the wrong crowd. However, after everything we have gone through as a family this year, I feel like it opened her eyes and made her reflect on herself. \n\nShe has changed and is no longer doing the stuff she used to do. However, it came at a cost because she is no longer the bubbly social butterfly she once was. I have a great relationship with my sister and we (there are 3 of us) all get along really well and are like best friends. but this is obviously not enough. She has no friends at school anymore and spends her lunch at the library. She is doing so much better in school and her grades are a lot better too. She really turned her life around. But she lost friends in the process.\n\nNow she has been telling me how she has been feeling lonely lately and I know it is hard for her. She was someone who would hang with a different group of friends everyday and she always had notifications going off on her phone because she was  so social. Now she is hanging out with no one. From time to time she will spend her lunch with some people who she still talks to. But she does not have any genuine close friends. It's even worse at home because she never goes out with friends and spends her evenings either on homework, napping or just chilling around the house.\n\nI worry this loneliness will lead her to feeling depressed.

I moved a lot recently and now I study in a big city, but work in a smaller one, far away. \nI recently came to the conclusion that I am truly an iceberg, drifting alone in a vast ocean. Fcking alone to be more specific. But I never wanted to separate from the ice pack.\n\nIt's not like I havent tried anything against it. \nI regularly try to plan things with my classmates. Eating outside, having a glass, activities like going to a hockey game. Or just doing something. But here generally everyone has some other plans. With the other classmates mostly. Even the one that I trusted the most found other friends this year. It's even harder since he was feeling low until last year and I kinda took care of him, helped him rise, get back on his feet from his break-up and encourage to get out. Now I'm kinda cut, I've fallen behind. \n\nI also tried out of the context of my classes. I used to play ice hockey last year, in an amateur team. Couldn't make any friend there, I even feel less welcome and appreciated than in my previous team. I am part of the photo studio of my school. But mostly I find people that only talk about themselves or don't talk at all. Finally I've tried to be oart of the Mountain Bike team of the university. Well... MTBers aren't the most sociable tbh... \n\nAt work, well I am the funny one. Make silly jokes, funny points every time, is nice to everyone, brings cakes and croissants every once in a while. But my colleagues just aren't of my age, mostly parents of +30 to almost 60. Not the ones I'm gonna be able to go to the bar with...\n\nI do have friends from my childhood or teenage years. All live very far away. My best friend, I've seem him once this year. The others... Well they've pretty much found other friends and ofc with distance we don't see each other that much. And it's always me that's got to move to see them. And we barely talk. \n\nI try to go to coffee places, to bars, to exhibitions or just outside to go take some photos... I sometimes get to talk quickly with people but even in my big city where I study everyone is just settled. Every one has their friends and no one needs to expand their circle to put it simply. \n\nSo I'm here watching the city from my 6th floor. It's 2 fcking AM here. I smoked a cigar although I never smoke. I am watching the Habs VS the Bruins but I don't even appreciate it. \n\nI am the guy that does a lot, has adventures, various activities, just does many things. But I have no one to tell. Sometimes I wonder if you can really call it if you don't share it with anyone. \n\nEverything I do, going for some shoots on the nearby basketball ground, going to watch a hockey game live, biking, or worse, taking photos of people in the streets, living the real life I wish to have... Everything just reminds me how fcking pointless it is when you have no one to do it with. A pal. A friend. A partner to do sh*t with. A lover maybe. Or a cousin , someone from the family. But no everyone is either busy enough or so far away or both. \n\nI am someone who loves to listen, to talk and overall to share. Everyday, the fact that I am not able to do this at all pains me a little more. \n\nHadn't I been born or raised social, I would have been perfect in this situation. But life has decided otherwise, to my greatest desperation.\n\nGood thing is I've never read so many books tho. At least I gain something from that. \n\nSending you all forever loners all my love.

So today we were signing up for the Thanksgiving potluck and I put down that I was cooking something (now I'm no great chef but I enjoy cooking and since I live alone it comes in handy).  So she says pretty much what I've heard before about how a man who can cook is a plus with women (of course we all know that being attractive and being able to cook is the actual bonus).  She then said to me what I consider one of the dumbest things a woman can tell a man...\"I've been divorced so I'm not looking for anything serious, but if I had met you earlier in life I would totally date you\".  Now I know it's a vicious cycle because there are some men who can't handle rejection maturely so while I know I'll rarely hear a woman say they aren't interested and leave it like that I can understand why they  can feel the need to say dumb things like \"if unicorns were real I'd date you\" or tell you they aren't interested and spend the next 5 to 10 minutes telling you that you are a wonderful person.  \n\nBut, back to my question.  She actually does date guys so but off course she told me that right now she needs a good friend and she asks me to hang out and stuff (as friends of course) but honestly at age 39 I have no interest in hanging out with women as just friends.  When I was younger I could've done that but I have reached a point where after seeing all my friends/cousins meet women and get married while the best I can do is be a \"good friend\" I honestly would rather just stay home by myself then go be some good friend.

We all want someone to love us and we want that love to last forever. Nothing is forever, even the love you envy that lasts 50, 60, 70 years will turn to ash in time. The important thing is to savor the little moments that happen on the day to day and make sure that you never stop looking for shade in the desert.\n\nThere are little things like kisses from a newly met girl at a New Years Eve party at midnight. There are bigger ones like a college love that ended over mutual immaturity. Every encounter with a woman (or man if you please) is like a little rest on a long, lonely road. Instead of fearing the end of the repose you enjoy now, be present and in the moment. Take all the comfort you can.\n\nI met a woman earlier this year that made me so ridiculously happy and then crushed my heart over the course of mere days. I remember at one point thinking, \u201cI may have found her.\u201d I can barely remember that pain now. It\u2019s like a dream maybe, or someone else\u2019s life. But I threw myself into it when it happened. I soaked in her adoration and then wept and howled with such anguish at her heartless rejection that I thought I would die.

I realize now that I broke.\n\nLike anyone, I had aspirations when I was younger. My top two were Pilot and Chef, and at some point I considered being an electrician. The latter was after a big move, and looking back on it now, after I had already begun to 'break'.   \nI grew up in a dysfunctional family, raised by a single grandmother, and watching as my mother went in and out of good and bad places. I had no father figure, either. I was a foster child a couple times, and would've stayed one if things went worse in the courts.  \n12 Schools while I was growing up, while most people only transition between 3 or 4 at most. People never left their home until they moved out, I only had a single home for less than 10 years, then shortly after entering high school, I would never live in the same place for more than 2 years. I've managed to recall about 25 different homes within 30 years.  \nMoving from city to city, or even across the country will ruin friendships, and you'll lose touch with people. It happened to me. Once that big move in my teen years happened, I would start to break down.  \nI slowly began to stop caring. Not just about the world around me, but about myself. I lost my aspirations, I lost my motivation, I lost my hopes of anything working out in the end. My oral hygiene fell to the point that my teeth are now deteriorating. I don't care to do anything more than what is absolutely necessary. \nThis all happened slowly over the course of 15+ years.\n\n  \nSomehow I've survived this long, but I've come to realize that I am indeed broken. I'm sure others can see it in me, too. I have a few friends that I'm grateful for, but I'm still beyond repair, I believe. If my existence matters to a few people, then I guess that's all that really matters.", "subreddit": "lonely"}

I have worked really hard in the past to get better. Worked on myself, discovered some unmet childhood needs, felt like I was getting better, even made some progress. I decided to go back to school, moving countries, I think partially because I needed my masters and partially because school is great for making friends.\n\nJust after I got admitted and was due to move from the city I hated so much for the three years I was there, I ended up meeting someone. He was a kind, gentle person who made me so so happy. However he couldn't understand my emotional struggles. I thought I could make it work. But once I moved, things didn't go too well. His understanding of emotional intimacy was very different than mine. He wasn't making me feel loved or cared for. I tried to express my needs to him, but for whatever reasons he decided to break up 1.5 months into me moving.\n\nThis break up triggered a lot for me. For a couple of days, I was a complete mess, convinced that I have relapsed. Till today I can only think one thing - that I didn't feel lonely when he was around till 2 weeks ago, and now I feel lonely. What is funny is, I am not actually lonely. I have made a great set of friends who have really been there for me. Who have heard me cry through all of this. My best friend who just vanished from my life and is now back has been there through it all. So I am not alone. But I feel lonely. \n\nWe have our mid term break going on, everyone is so happy. But I just can't wait to start again so that I don't have to be in my room by myself. The thought of that gives me anxiety. Got a bit of monophobia there.\n\nThere is obviously the pain of heartbreak. I genuinely believe he was a good guy who broke up because we were different people in a very uncertain long distance. My previous relationships have been abusive and unhealthy. I am finding letting go of an actually good person more difficult.\n\nBut I made progress, from realizing my own trauma bonds, to making the effort of doing better for myself. And now I start therapy in less than 48 hours to nip this conditioned loneliness anxiety/monophobia in the bud.\n\nSpirituality has helped me a lot and I am actively going back to my faith to help me through this.\n\nWe will fight the good fight. Universe will one day be kind upon us and that's all that we need for now.\n\nI am here if anyone wants to chat. :)", "subreddit": "lonely"}

It's been a tough year, yes a year with dumps and coming backs.\n\nSo now it seems she dumped me for good, another guy appeared (the third one?...) and well I don't want it to be but I hope this is the last time. She is happy right now playing with him, doing videocalls and all that shit, he knows him roughly for a month, online gaming. They like each other, want to see each other... When she told me that just when I came from working in Mexico and we were suppose to be boyfriends again. But well this is not a love-reddit...\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow as 29yo on December, I see myself totally lonely, no friends, no family (just parents but yeah, I don't matter much for them), heart broken. I'm excited to go to work because that is I a place I have the excuse to talk to people and actually quite good so people kinda need me and I love that feeling of being important to someone, even if it's just for work.\n\nI am very introvert and people just doesn't care about me while I always try to help others whenever I can, I love when people ask me things I feel \"loved\" and I help willingly but it's all that. When I tried to connect with people, asking for a meet I always feel they do it for respect not because they want to. If I say nothing they tend to leave progressively.\n\nMy weekly routine is work, gym and videogames/reading. If I ever stop doing something I just remember my ex-gf my loneliness and I just die inside. Weekends are terrible, my future is dark. I've been like this for ever, but I touched heaven with my ex-gf for (roughly) 3 years and now this feels like true hell. Before knowing her I just didn't know what was love and I could keep going on my life...\n\nSo yeah I hope to talk with people here, not just for me, if anyone want to talk something about him/herself with me I'm really up to. Also gamers out there we can do some gaming or book reading if up to. Any PLC programmers want to share knowledge I'd happy to do so aswell. I'd likely want to hear your overcoming stories or advices from those who embraced loneliness and live with it happily (if it's ever possible).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nP.S: I'm from Spain, sorry for any mistakes.", "subreddit": "lonely"}

It was a new relationship that's now long gone and we were snowed in at her place. It was a brutal winter and clearly any plans that we would have had the next day were sure to be canceled. There was no safe way for me to get home, not that I was in any rush to do so, so there was nothing to do but stay the night and enjoy the company of this lovely new person that had just dropped into my life.\nThere was no sex that night; we were very into each other but we were taking things slow but that's not to say we weren't having fun. We got into bed around 9pm, we kissed, cuddled, talked, and just shared with each other. I'd never been so open and myself with someone else, it felt amazing and I knew there I was falling in love and hard. \nThe next time I looked at the clock it was 3am. I was flabbergasted that I'd spent 6 hours just talking, being with, and loving this girl in what felt like no time at all. I wished there that time would stop moving and we could stay there; I still wish it had.\nWe were young and of course young relationships rarely work, we burnt out after about a year when we both realized that we had dreams we wanted to chase. I've had a couple of crummy relationships since then. I've currently been single for a bit now and feeling very jaded about the whole dating thing. I don't trust as easily anymore and it takes me maybe a little too long to warm up to people. I was feeling lonely and trying to think of a time that I really felt love and that was it. I'm still lucky enough to see her every now and then; she's settled into a happy relationship with a great guy who takes care of her and I am genuinely happy to see that for her. We're both different people now but I can't help but wonder how she'd feel if she knew that night for me is still the most loved I've ever felt.

Nothing physical happened and at that point even thinking about making a move made me puke. We just smoked up, watched a couple of episodes of The Office and talked a lil bit. After I dropped her at her place, I started having second thoughts like did she even like me and that usual insecure bullshit. Now since we're both shy irl, it's much easier to open up with her online. So I straight up asked her, if she thought this would go somewhere abd if she liked me.

Although I have no idea what to do next (and to my advantage neither does she), I'm probably the happiest I have ever been. I feel like if we officially date, it would be one of those weird ass relationships where both of us have no clue what we're doing but still trying our best to do better. I guess this is partially a success story so I guess I'll title it that.", "subreddit": "ForeverAlone"}

One year ago, I met a girl (20 at the time) on this sub who wrote that she is feeling the same way many of you do now, abandoned, isolated, and hopeless, roommate to a extroverted best friend who doesn't even invite her to parties. Although we live on different continents, we have both worked on our friendship, watching movies, discussing, playing video games over the net, and she says I know her more than anyone by now (which honors me). She is a person I genuinely care for and love. I am telling you all of this to show you that it is not impossible to find someone you can deeply connect with on this very sub.\n\nNow on to the title.\n\nMany here complain about being ghosted. Unquestionably, being ghosted is one of the most hurtful things one can experience, especially when already vulnerable, but still trying to trust a stranger, only to be rejected after days, weeks or a couple of months.\n\nWhy does it happen? Because being friends with a lonely person is very hard.\n\nI will speak from my point of view, as someone who is almost never lonely, not because I have a lot of friends, but because I am a high introvert who always finds something to entertain me and I don't crave people around me. Even while being like this, I am very adept at communication. I have worked for years in retail, where being good at communicating is crucial, so I am not socially awkward and make friends rather easily. Please take these things into consideration when imagining from which angle I am speaking.\n\nWhen I find myself open to the idea of making a new friend who is lonely, I have to ask myself, am I willing to invest a huge amount of time? Depending on the amount of time someone has been lonely, you can find people who would want to talk with you every day for hours (as did my friend who I spoke of). Now be honest with yourself, how many hours would you be willing to give someone every day, if you were not lonely, and were busy with family, your relationship, and perhaps school or work? Half an hour to one hour per week, maybe double that for very close friends. This is not even close to enough for people who crave companionship, so a dilemma appears. Their need makes them become a burden for a person who is not in their shoes and is offering a normal friendship. So the non-lonely person starts backing off to find some balance, which makes the lonely person press even more sometimes, which makes things worse. In the end, ghosting happens.\n\nHere is what I suggest:\n\n1. This sub is making a mistake by not insisting that posters disclose their age, gender, and country of residence in every post, which would help people connect and filter out who might be worth their time, but you can start adding these yourself.\n2. Lonely people who start getting to know someone, just because someone has contacted you, that does not mean they will give you the amount of attention you need. Always lowball the interest in the beginning and keep the topics light unless someone really asks about the dark stuff in your past (physical/sexual abuse, alcoholism, drug abuse, abandonment, self-harm, suicidal thoughts, psychological problems like bipolar personality disorder and OCD, are all topics you should avoid in the beginning. These are NOT things that make people want to hang out with you. You might get some pity attention, but it won't form a friendship).I like to remember a proverb I once read:\"You have to earn the right to be yourself\".\n3. You being lonely does not make you interesting to talk to. This is not what makes you special, so whining and complaining will not make people want to continue talking with you. If you have a hobby, there is probably a subreddit for that hobby. Finding friends there would be easier than here, because you already have a common interest\n4. Who contacts whom is irrelevant in a real friendship. Even if you never get contacted first, what you should be looking at is the replies. I almost never contact my friend, but whenever she does contact me, I make the time to listen to her and have a fun time talking with her (I reply with attention to what she is talking about, and keep the conversation going). This is how I am as a person, not because it's her. I will gladly give company, but I never specifically need it myself.\n5. Lastly, knowing how to make friends is all about knowing how to make the other person feel good and cared for. If I came to my friend a year ago and started talking about my issues, how would she feel? Even more hopeless, because I have reaffirmed that the world is sad and hard. So I let her speak, say everything, and I countered with attention, and an occasional tease or joke (I really found an interesting girl XD). Eventually, days later, she wanted to know more about me, and that is when I unloaded the weight of the world from my shou- NO! I just said keep it light! XD\n\nEveryone, the world doesn't care for you. No one owes you any sympathy just for being alive. You have to go out there and work for your happiness. You've been dealt a harsh hand (circumstances) in your life? Someone would love to trade their hand with you! Waiting for someone to save you will not happen to most people. Some would argue that my friend got saved my me. No. She wrote a post that made her stand out and seem interesting in a sea of \"I am lonely, someone talk to me\" one sentence posts.\n\nIn the end, I will tell you how my friend and I started our friendship.\n\n1. For 3 months, we only exchanged long (we would reach character limit, which is 10 000) mail like private messages on reddit, usually one to two days between sending and getting a reply. NO CELL PHONE CONTACT ALLOWED! Replying took from half an hour to an hour and a half. I went in it with the intent on enjoying the process of getting to know her and that was it. This also serves as a buffer to not burden either side and give both parties space.\n2. I imposed a rule in my first message to her. We would reply to the previous message, and always ask 2 questions at the end as an incentive to continue the conversation. She accepted. The questions were silly/light most of the time, and things that could not be answered with a yes or no. There are lists of interesting and fun questions you can ask someone. Google it.\n3. When we grew fond of each other, I asked her for her phone number, but this was only so I could tell her why I am not replying in the usual time frame if I was busy, and not to talk with her. Eventually we got to phone messaging.\n\nThat's it. Later on we started watching movies while being connected on skype. Recently she got into a relationship so her friend circle is slowly growing along with her, so she's doing better. :)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf you have read so far, I thank you for your time.

I really wanted a body mod (literally just a nose piercing, not much to ask for + im 18 so...) all she said was no and that she will be disgusted of me and wont eat around me, cuz of how disgusting that is... yep. Im gonna treat her with silence treatment for a few days, maybe she will take that back + she knows everything what im suffering from and that hurt me even more. Like i still have a bit of personality left that makes me interested in body mods and she took that away from me too. So i guess ill distance myself from her and everyone else. \n\nNo one needs me so im just gonna exist as a piece of walking meat till i kill myself .\n\nSorry for not using proper wordings in my post too, my head hurts from all the crying and add is worse too today, cant concentrate at all", "subreddit": "lonely"}

I was put in a really good school by my really incredible parents, but because there was a big demographic difference between me and the other kids, I really ended up as an outcast and eventually all my connections with everybody were severed. Then I started to change internally.... As a person. I had - and still have - all these thoughts and feelings stuck in my head about how I'm just a terrible and ugly person and about how nobody likes me and such. But things are still waaaay better than say one or three or four years ago when I was a 100% borderline personality because of my solitude.\n\nIt's slightly better now but I'm still alone. Because of all this loneliness I have this desperate need and urge to express my constant pain through writing so I have this great thriller story in my mind featuring a lonely girl who finds her love only to have it taken away by something...\n\nThere's only one problem: I don't know her backstory. Yes, I know my own, but I want hers to be different or it'll be too personal and that makes me uncomfortable. \n\nSo that's why I'm asking you this question: how did you end up alone. Not only is this for us to collectively empathize with each other, but also so I can figure out different ways people realistically end up alone.\n\nAnd remember, keep turning the pages of life, something good eventually might turn up.", "subreddit": "lonely"}

I used to live in Anchorage, Alaska, a decently sized city but nothing of the calliber of the Bay Area, where I currently live. I've been in the Bay Area for around 5 years at this point (came for uni and stayed for work) and I've found that I've become much more distrustful of people. Interactions seem not necessarily superficial, but I don't get the impression that people genuinely care for one another. The culture here is very much about how the individual can build themselves up and a lot of \"friendships\" come of more like the \"aquaintances\". On top of that living here is so expensive that its very easy to alienate yourself from people who are a bit less frugal ( I try to save most of my paycheck and make a decent salary for the area 85k). Dating isn't great here either. The hook-up culture is very predominant, and it very much feels like my worth is being heavily judged on my income and looks while character falls to the way-side. Don't get me wrong I know that income and looks matter, but I'm only 24. There are far more older and well-developed men here who seem to attract the attention of most of the women especially on dating apps. And the fact that women seem to have this check list of criteria they need further reflects that feeling of distrust people have towards each other at first glance. I never felt this way back in Alaska. I don't know if its the lack of nature here or the wealth disparity of the Bay area, but there is something really wrong about the community or lack there of in the big city. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIn the words of Bobby Tarantino \"Who can relate?\"   What have your experiences been like?", "subreddit": "lonely"}

TLDR at the end.\n\nBasically 6 months ago I crushed on this woman at work. We got tons in common, we have a lot of fun together, and slowly but surely I started crushing on her.\n\nAt first nothing really happened. I'm a FA loser but somehow after some time we grew closer. Now we sometimes go out after work to hang out at my place and drink some beers together.\n\nProblem is, she's got a really wide and big circle of friends and potential sex mates. I don't, obviously. I feel like the two of us somehow could have worked but she's just got TOO MANY people gravitating around her. It sucks.\n\nAt work we're always together. Our coworkers often say how \"cute\" we are together and they seem to believe we're actually in a relationship. We're not, obviously again; and we never will be. But when we're the two of us people believe it. And I started believing it too.\n\nShe teases me, she playfully flirts, she often acts like we're actually together, gives me cute small names and all that, but she says it jokingly and she says she's amused people seem to think we're actually together. I'm like, yeah, lol, that's funny. But deep inside I don't find it funny obviously because I like her.\n\nLong story short: I've become the archetypical friendzoned loser and an hour ago she told me how she was so happy because this weekend she'll be seeing her friends (meanwhile I'll be alone and I'll get shitfaced drunk as always to forget how shitty my life is but I never told her that) and especially one guy who she hopes she'll have sex with.\n\nShe seems convinced she'll have him and she's really happy about it. Being the stereotypical friendzoned loser that I am I pretended to find it cool and how happy I was for her. Yeah. But obviously deep inside it hurt so fucking much.\n\nThis girl is the closest I'll ever find to a soulmate. But she's got tooooo many people gravitating around her. Why would she care about a loser like me? Yeah she has no reason to and she never will. I'm just her friend and that's why she tells me everything about her sex and love life. And I pretend I'm happy but I'm not.\n\nShe left my place 1h ago after telling me all that and then I went out a little, full of alcohol, and I was so fucking angry at everything and everyone on my way back home. Truly felt like anger was consuming me.\n\nI just want to fucking die. I'm tired of everything. But you know what? Maybe it's because of the booze (yeah I drink everyday now when I come back from work in that lonely and dark place I call my home) but I'm actually happy. I know I'll never have her, nor anyone else.\n\nI've accepted that I'll be forever alone and now I feel fucking free. I don't have anyone. I don't even have any kind of family. No one gives a fuck about me. Except her. But she sees me as a friend. I know I'll eventually commit suicide and I love that thought, because death will free me from all this suffering that I've endured my whole life.\n\nTLDR: I've somehow become best friends with the woman I crushed on at work but she sees me as nothing but a good friend. She tells me about her sex and love life and it makes me want to kill myself even though I pretend I'm happy for her. Life sucks. I've accepted that I'll be FA and now I feel free. But death will be the ultimate freedom.", "subreddit": "ForeverAlone"}

Gets good grades, part of a few clubs, and works part time at a Five Guys. I guess that brings some sort of context if you need it.\n\nWhen I turned 16, I started to notice that I never really had anyone around me. I talk to people daily now and back then but I never really had any friends. I have always been that guy that everyone knew but didn't hang out with. The only time I really talk to people is when they need help from me (homework help, tutoring, projects, etc). Every time I tried to start up a normal conversation with someone (about the weather, baseball games, and other stuff like that), it never carried on and died out shortly after, and we would just continue doing what we met to do. I have never really been able to talk with other people outside of helping them. The worst part is even though I know these people don't really care about me just that I'm helping them; I keep on doing it just because it feels good to talk to sit down with another person and talk. \n\nThis has been the case for around 3 years. Lately for the past 6 months or so, I have been having these lonely spirals. Sometimes if im sitting down or laying down not doing something, All I begin to think is that I'm alone. I just sit there and let it come. I come to these realizations that no one, outside of my parents, really has cared about me. That if I were to just die, no one to show up to my funeral. If I were sick no one would visit me in the hospital. If I ran into some sort of trouble I would be alone in dealing with it. That I will die alone (my biggest fear). They all seem so real, Like these mini movies in my head playing out these scenarios over and over. Sometimes I can manage these thoughts and sometimes I can't. I've broken down and cried in college restrooms and my bedroom more times than I'd like to say. I don't know where any of this has been coming from, I'm not depressed (I am lonely). But, in these moments it's just a stream of the worst possible feelings hitting me straight in the face. The weird thing is I never considered myself alone before these though came about.\n\nI never found a way to say this to anyone. I had always just bottled up the emotions and hoped they would never come out again. This has just gotten harder lately and I don't know what to do. I always put up this happy persona for people and hope they will find out that something is wrong, if that makes sense. They never do and I keep on bottling up these feelings and then that stream of thoughts comes back around. For some reason that i'll never be able to explain, I need  someone else to see what's wrong with me before I can talk about it. \n\nI never had confronted this issue before and this post was mostly to see it right in front of me to know exactly what it looks like.", "subreddit": "lonely"}

Im laying in bed at home right now and feeling like I want to die again. I just want to know that people have been where I\u2019m at or somewhere similar and found happiness. That or literally just a comment so I know someone out there is hearing me.\n\nI spent the majority of my childhood in poverty, with neglectful and sometimes abusive parents. I have two older sisters by about 10 years. They used to physically abuse me. I was bullied a lot at school. One time my neighborhood/lifelong friend turned on me when a group of bullies was instigating us. They surrounded us and he started to fight me instead of defend me. \n\nAnyway, from there I went into foster care. That was at about 7-8 years old. My step dad was sexually abusing my sister, and my dad is a prescription opioid addict. My mom refused to move out of our step dad\u2019s, and none of our family would take us, so yeah. I eventually ended up staying with an aunt and uncle who were very well-to-do in 4th grade. I stayed there for a year, and then they kicked me out because I was too much of a burden on them. That was in 5th grade. Stayed in the system till 8th grade, when my other aunt and uncle took me in. They lived two states over. I went to high school and stayed there, never building any lasting relationships, and then they kicked me out on my graduation night, while my two cousins who were graduating went on a cruise to Mexico. I was sleeping in my car in the parking lot of a red-roof-inn in Ohio, crying, wanting nothing more than to kms, while they were literally getting mani-pedis in preparation for a three week cruise. \n\nI ended up at my grandparents apartment in PA, and worked in a factory for a few months. I applied to a big state school in Indiana, and started my freshman year during spring of 2018. That was a rough semester. It was there that I would have my first sexual encounter ever. I matched with some sorority girl on Tinder, we smashed, I fell in love with her, and she dumped me. This was over the span of a month. She dumped me over text while she was at a party. Thats when I attempted suicide. I took about 7.5 grams of pure caffeine powder, and then just waited for it to do its thing. I changed my mind after about 30 minutes, ran to my car, and drove to the hospital the best I could. I didnt know where to go in at, so I ended up just leaning myself up against a chain-link fence in a gravel ditch along the road near the hospital. I started vomiting a lot. Like a lot. Then I got up and walked into the ambulance entrance. I passed out from there, but I just remember throwing up a lot. \n\nI haven\u2019t seriously dated anyone since then, and im not sure if I should or will. I feel like I have too much wrong with me mentally to ever have a healthy relationship with a woman, considering my lack of relationships with my family. I got \u201cadopted\u201d two years ago shortly after this all happened. A friend from high school invited me into his family, and thats who im with now. Every once in a while ill still withdraw myself completely from their family out of suspicion of resentment. Im broken. \n\nI feel like nobody wants me or will ever love me, but I know its only the result of my inability to let people love me.\n\nI started trying to socialize more and make new friends, but I still feel like im nobody\u2019s priority. Nobody messages me first. Nobody invites me to things. In fact, nobody even wished me a happy birthday this year. I think people either just don\u2019t think about me, or that people just genuinely dont like me. I started taking an antidepressant recently, and its really only making things worse.

I was popular as I had always been in every school I went to because people thought I was funny and I was super charismatic back then. Eventually, I decided to enroll at a Japanese middle school for a year for the cultural experience and in the regard it was enriching and I even picked up a lot of Japanese, but on the other hand it set off a chain of events I hadn\u2019t considered before I went there. The issues:\n1. I thought they would be more interested in me because of my foreignerness but the novelty wore off in less than a week.\n2. They didn\u2019t speak English well, I didn\u2019t speak Japanese well so communication was tricky.\n3. Because communication was so tricky they rarely came up and tried to talk to me so it was always down to me to make the first move. \n4. Like most people I am an ambivert and on many days I was just too tired to have to be the one keeping the interaction up, further alienating me and making them think I didn\u2019t want to talk to them.\n5. At the same time all of this is happening, I am hanging out with my friends from before less and less. Even with kids who speak English and went to school with me, I was always the one to initiate interaction but I can\u2019t fully blame them for that because \u201cout of sight out of mind\u201d even though I lived on base with a lot of them.\n\nEveryone was forgetting about me.\n\nAfter that year in Japanese school ended, I was just fed up with it and I decided not to go on to Japanese high school. I was already behind in a year\u2019s worth of credits (which I am still making up for) I enrolled in an online predatory school and got to work. I was positive at first, but then after months of asking my friends to do something like \u201clet\u2019s go to the city two train stops from here!\u201d And them saying \u201ceh, it\u2019s too far, I\u2019m lazy bleh :P \u201c and then seeing on their Instagram that they went to Yokohama or somewhere even further with someone else, I got sick of it. I was always the one to text first, I was always the one left on read and I was at my limit. \n\nIf they didn\u2019t want me, fine, I don\u2019t want them either.\n\nI have a good relationship with my family. I love them all so much and sometimes I feel guilty for longing for other friends, it\u2019s just there are somethings I don\u2019t want to talk to them about. And though I am grateful for my time with them,  I became accustomed to my friends caring about me and when they just stopped it sent me into a spiral I still am not out of. I don\u2019t know who to hate, them or myself. Them for abandoning me, or me for squandering the time I had with them. And now, every time I think of that place, where all of this happened, where I went from the one everyone could depend on to a memory long forgotten by my beloved friends, I feel seething hate, hate for an entire nation of people who haven\u2019t done me wrong just because 30 Japanese kids didn\u2019t want to be my friend. I have always been disconnected from my peers in some way, but not like this, never like this. \n\nAnd even now, I can\u2019t break out of it. How am I supposed to leave home for college and go away from the only people I know into a world I don\u2019t remember how to speak to anymore. Every time I see someone close to my age I seize up.

Like she was litterally (and I mean litterally) the only person i can talk to. Like Karen Blocked me, Rebecca never answers or just hangs up mid way through a sentence and my other friend let's call him jason all he wants to do is play video games and nothing else. \n\nLike what the fuck I litterally cant do shit about this not to mention I cant make any new friend cause I cant start a conversation with a new person for shit so.

During that summer we houses a few foreign exchange students. Fell madly for a French girl named clove. I absolutely adored her. We were great and I actually felt loved and wanted. Best thing I ever felt in my life. But she went back home after that summer. Obviously long distance didn't satisfy any of our wants or needs. Especially being in another country. I wouldn't really call that a relationship, but I sure did get a taste of what a relationship was. I've been single my whole life and I just want that feeling of being wanted or loved. The feeling of skin to skin touch. Not even sexual. But now I'm in college. That feeling of extreme loneliness has been amplified by seeing the mass quantities of relationships. It also doesn't help that my roommate and his gf cuddle and absolutely adore each other. Which is extremely great and cute to see. But it just makes me question why I can't have that, and why it's taking so long. I just feel like in the sense of all that, I'm getting nowhere in life. Im. Lonely.", "subreddit": "lonely"}

This post might be really long, I just need to let my feelings out.\n\n\n\nI don't know, stuff's also been kinda unfortunate for me, nothing good currently happening. I lost my streak as an honor student (I still have good grades tho, just not qualified to be one), friends leaving, and well, getting ghosted.\n\n\n\n\n\nGetting ghosted hurts. I think someone else here has experienced that at least once, this was the first time I got ghosted and I was really confused, this was because I liked her. I'm a really chill dude if you'd ask me, I really didn't care if she liked someone else, I respected that, she knew I liked her, and I knew she liked someone else. \n\n\nWe were very close to each other, we talked about our problems and spent nights talking and comforting each other. (I have a lot of close friends too but I wasn't really open to them because i'm very shy haha). She even talked to me about the boy she liked not having the courage to talk to her (they liked each other).\n\n\n\n Things went on like this for a while until one day, she asked me to help her with something. Her Word was acting up so she asked help from me and so I helped her, same stuff, after I helped her, she thanked me and even called me the best. (This was an examination week so she had to create a reviewer).\n\n\n\nA few hours after talking to her, I went and asked her, \"Hey how's the review going?\". She left me on read, I really didn't mind that as it was an examination week and I guess she had to review first before replying. The next day, I messaged her again, saying hello. Her leaving me on read went on for like 5 days, It was getting kinda odd for me because she normally replies after reviewing. It was Monday and I asked her friends if they knew what she was up to, they told me that she would talk to me about something after the exams (Sunday).\n\n\n\nExaminations passed. I waited for her message, nothing (Sunday), It was Monday, school was done and still no message, Tuesday came, I woke up to a message, it was from her, the message was sent 11pm that night so I didn't see it. It was a very long sorry message, saying that she was sorry because she was trying to avoid me, she told me that she didn't want me to get hurt while her being happy, so she tried avoiding me to see if I would stop talking to her, being the friendly guy that I am (i liked her but i expected us more to be best friends or something), I didn't stop.  \n\n\n\nI'll skip the rest of the message because it would be too long if I explained it. I replied saying that everything is alright. I still tried to talk to her like I would talk to her last time, she has never replied.\nIt was to the point that I didn't get invited to her birthday and all that, I started to get sad, feeling lost. I still attended though, she wasn't mad or anything, just surprised. I guess that just made things worse, until now, I still say hello to her everyday, still no reply as of now. \n\n\nI think I screwed up a little, attending her party even though I wasn't invited (it was a coincidence that we were also waiting for someone at the venue and we were just invited by her mother.)\nAnyways, now you guys know about the ghosting, I feel confused and sad, I really don't know what I've done wrong. I really know I did nothing wrong though, but why? She told me things that only I knew about, and stuff, its just plain confusing on why she'd ghost, you guys get me? I know this is starting to get long so I'll make it quick. I noticed that she was closer to the guy that she liked (its awesome that I finally see some effort from him,she was really sad). But I feel like crap because I feel like I got used in some way, now I don't know what to do, should I just let it slide? Or should I talk to her personally?\n\n\n\nI'm sorry if this is a little off-topic, but like I said, I have no one to talk to and I want to ask you guys on what to do.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTLDR;\n\nI got ghosted by the person that I was very close to and until now, she hasn't answered my question \"Why?\".", "subreddit": "lonely"}

Feelings in the workplace.", "author": "Lil0102", "self_text": "I work for an ad agency. I'm a graphic designer and I work as a pair with a writer. That's how it generally works. Hope I make sense in this post. Feel a bit dumb on here, but here I am. \n\nSince July 2019  (now November 2019), I've (24F) been working with this guy (35M). Sure, when I met him and found out I was gonna work with him, I thought \"gee he's handsome\" ... and I made lots of jokes about it with my friends. Just joking, as I'm married and so is the writer. Let's call him \"Guy\". \n\nUsually they don't pair men and women together (it's not like a rule or anything) but anyway, everyone in the office has made jokes about us being a couple, blah blah. I am getting to the point, bare with me. Please read xx \n\n But after just a few weeks I started feeling this weird sexual tension between us. I thought, \"nah things are just weird in my relationship at the moment, Guy is just very attractive ...\". I've only been with one man and we got married young, 20. Guy has been married for 6 years and has kids, which I don't.\n\nIt all started during our first \"brain storm\" session. It was like 6pm and we decided to polish everything for the pitch the following day (we often work late and share a pretty secluded work space). We both felt screwed, like we had no good ideas. He started being really immature and coming up with ridiculous ideas as a joke and scribbling idiotic doodles. We were both laughing, until I got annoyed. I'm pretty stressed at work and I'm a junior so I feel like I have a lot to prove. He apologized and we decided to step out for a coffee to regain our sanity. He started asking me about my husband and talking about his wife. We were bitching about them as friends would. But I noticed the mood was weird. He hooked arms with me at one point, I pulled away. \n\nWe ended up scoring mega brownie points with our boss when the pitch went really well. He boasted that he knew we'd be a good team and we've been rocking it ever since, like almost every brief has been amazing. I won my first advertising award which I'm so happy about. They're not super rare to win, but still! The tension revealed itself so many times over the last few months. \n\nSuper recently, we were talking about the project, which was an alcohol brand, and I don't even drink much, at all really, minus a glass of something on New Year or something. He said he has the brand at home and I need to try it if I'm going to be passionate about the project, goofing off. He lives right by work so I actually popped in after work and was expecting to meet his wife etc. Thought that would help me actually, reality to set in. But no one was home(long story). C'mon, he knew his wife wouldn't be home. That's definitely when I felt it wasn't all im my head. He offered me the alcohol and we both got really tipsy and it was actually an amazing \"night\" (probably like an hour and a half). So many laughs. \n\nI remember commenting on what a mess I looked in the mirror and he came up behind me and said I look \"ethereally beautiful\" and then made fun of me,  asking if I even knew that word (he's the writer and I suck so much with the ad copy). He had his hands on my shoulders and was in his house, which he shares with his wife. Is that not wrong?? Because I wouldn't do that.  I ignored his comment and we went to smoke on the balcony. I said something to him and he didn't reply. Then I said \"You're too f-ed to even listen to me, haha\" and he started looking at me for an uncomfortable length of time (well I wasn't uncomfortable, I had butterflies because I'm stupid). He has such  gorgeous green eyes. I said, \"what?\". And he said \"what\" and I said \"what \" ... you get it. Sorry this seems very dumb. Then, well, nothing. I went  home. I wanted to kiss him so badly that night, on the balcony. He was so close to me. It was a little cold. I could feel his breathe on my skin. I sound dumb? Sorry. But I feel like he did too. \n\n Yes, I do stuff too, like fiddle with his hair (curly sexy hair, haha) and call him an idiot. Or \"old man\" because he's 11 years my senior. Or we were laughing so hard the one morning and he said \"Ah, Lilly, we'd be such good friends if I didn't have to hate you and if you could spell ... I like you so much\". Then there was an awkward silence. We've had a lot of deep, overly personal conversations too. He's an amazing guy. \n\n I'm not going to make a move on him, I'm not the type to make moves anyway. But I'm scared that he makes a physical advance and that I can't resist him. That would be the worst thing to happen, but ignoring everything and going on as normal clearly isn't working. When he looked at me for so long I thought he was going to do something. I know he was not fully sober though.\n\nThere have been other things, like I saw him crying (teary) while having a smoke outside and I asked him what's wrong and he said he couldn't tell me. I don't assume it had anything to do with me. And he said \"Sometimes I forget you're basically a kid, don't worry about my miserable nonsense\". What does that even mean?? We exchanged a long hug and I liked it so much, but I felt so sad an empty after that I almost shed a tear. I don't understand why I'm like this.  \n\nFINALLY, here is the reason I'm writing this here and now. Today I wanted to show him one of my designs (normal) so I called him over to my work computer (also normal) and he sat next to me to scroll through stuff. Yes, there was a lot of tension, for me. His arm was right next to mine and I felt so much warmth (for lack of a better word). The word \"electricity\" is just too cliche. As we were looking at stuff, he abruptly said \"I can't stand this Lil, I can't f-ing stand this\". Then he left the room and came back ages later. I didn't have a chance to say anything and I don't know what he was possibly referring to, the work was relaxed. He was so agro out of nowhere and I did nothing. I can only assume he feels it too. \n\n How do I address this? I'm just so confused with myself and my marriage and everything. Clearly he is too. I don't know. \n\nThis is a big deal because I hate that I'm experiencing these feelings and I worry that maybe I made a big mistake getting married at 20. My husband is so damn busy all the time/away for work and that's definitely a part of it. I find myself wishing I'd have been with other men before him, which is so odd for me to think. We argue a lot about this issue, but he doesn't take it seriously and says I'm needy and that he's trying to build a career, but he cancels every time I try to make plans with him to bond. \n\nTLDR: Im so sure we both feel this way, but I don't know how to address it, and I don't want it to escalate without me nipping it in the bud but I don't know what to do and I don't want to lose my job. We're a great team. I feel like I should chat to him about it, obviously, but then what? New work partner? New job? Chat to my husband too?  I guess it's just ... awful.", "subreddit": "lonely"}

This differs from feeling \"numb\" in which this feeling isn't pleasant nor unpleasant. You may feel as if you're on autopilot or that your limbic system is taking a long vacation. You might find yourself unable to cry or express joy anymore.\n\nUnexplained aches and pains - I get this in my arms and it can spread to my bladder and give me an urge to pee. This could be physical, to keep that in mind. However, they could be psychosomatic and related to mental illness.\n\nLoss of motivation - You can hardly hold a conversation as you don't feel motivated to say anything or it feels like you have nothing to say that's important. Your hygiene might slip, your grades might drop, and/or you find yourself starting, then quickly, abandoning projects.\n\nDissociation - Feeling as if you don't exist or that things around you have changed. Feeling detached and separated from your surroundings.\n\nSocial isolation - Well, I think you're all familiar with this one.\n\nDepression and/or anxiety - Not much needed to be said.

A full-blown episode is absolutely horrifying. You lose all aspects of your personality, you lose all memory of who you once were, you hear and see things that don't exist, you doubt your own reality, etc. It's very real, and it does sometimes happen to people who are depressed and **especially** people who are depressed and socially isolated.

Bonus points if you were diagnosed with IBS, because people with psychotic disorders often have bowel issues as well.

Pretty funny. But I can't move beyond that. I can't feel connection. No matter how much clowning around I do, no matter how many jokes I make people laugh at, no matter how much I try and help people, I just don't care. I don't care. What am I looking for? True connection. Friendship. Romance. Anything. Anything where I'm not just a caricature. I'm a real person. I have a story.  Why do I feel so alone? What is this thing gnawing inside me? Why can't I make a connection or a bond or anything. I'm so used to change, impermanence, being let down. How do I actually open myself up? How do I let myself feel again? I want to care but I just feel like I can't.  I feel so jaded.  \n\n\nThanks cocaine for making me miserable. Thanks to everyone who didn't give a shit about me at the house party. Thanks to everyone who didn't even ask how I am. At least I found connection isn't at the bottom of a baggy.", "subreddit": "lonely"}

I've never liked a guy until I got to college, and no one has ever liked me. I started liking someone about a year ago, and I still do, but he's never liked me. And it hurts every time I see him because I want to hang around him and be good friends but every time I see him I'm reminded of how unlovable I am. Also I know quite a few people who have had no issue starting relationships. Why does no one like me? I feel like if no one's liked me through high school and now through the first half of college why would anyone like me beyond that? I know I still have a long life ahead of me but it still really hurts. I'm also struggling with my sexuality right now too because I think I might be ace since I never really think of anyone as cute/hot and I never really think about or want sex. And it's so annoying because it took me 19 years to finally like a guy romantically and it was so hard for me to get to that point, and now that I finally want a boyfriend, I can't get one because I've realized that no one will ever like me. I feel like I'm almost at the point where if anyone asked me out I would say yes regardless of who it was because I'm so lonely and desperate.  Which isn't gonna happen anyway because no one will ever like me. I hate myself so much for sounding so pathetic. I just hate how easy it is for people I know to start relationships and I've been struggling pretty much my whole life.\n\nAnd the thing is for pretty much my whole life I hated the concept of dating and it never really made sense to me. I always thought it was just stupid, especially for me it makes the most sense to date someone to see if they would be a good husband/wife. I guess now that I'm getting older I'm starting to think about that more and I'm starting to think about what I would want out of a husband? But how can I do that if no one will ever like me or ask me out?\n\nI also never understood blind dates or dating apps. To me it makes the most sense to date a close friend because you already know so much about each other so you could know whether or not a relationship would work. So I dont want someone to set me up or use a dating app. I just don't see how those could create long term relationships.\n\nMaybe my standards are too high? Maybe I'm just unlikable? Why is it so easy for other people to date and not me? I just want someone to love me.\n\nI'm sorry for the rant and if this post was petty and pathetic.

My body hurts and my heart is always feels heavy. I\u2019ve started taking painkillers for my joint and back pains and crying when they wear off.

My mom says that she won\u2019t judge if I tell her how I feel, and when I tell her something that\u2019s hurting me she says\u201d why are you being such a crybaby? Other kids have suffered 20x worse than you and you say you\u2019re sad?\u201d Some support. I want to go to sleep and just stay like that. I find my mind going to such dark places that I never thought possible. I see other girls my age and wonder\u201d why aren\u2019t I like that?\u201d I try to fit in and be \u201cperfect\u201d. But I can\u2019t. I want to be the perfect daughter but I can\u2019t. I want to be the funny happy go lucky kid in the group, but I\u2019m dying in the inside. Everyday is harder and harder to get out of bed to the point where I am actually counting the estimated amount of time it\u2019ll take me to finally graduate high school and sleep for a little bit more. I want to tell my mom how I really feel when we argue, but I only end up agreeing with her. No fighting back, no hesitation. I want to sleep. I\u2019m so fucking tired. I just wanna sleep. Is that to much to ask for? For one day that I can relax and not worry about if dad is fed, or if the dishes are clean? Apparently it is. But I don\u2019t care anymore, I\u2019m just numb now.

I watched the world completely transform during my teenage years and early 20s. And I always had trouble making friends because I'm kind of weird and kind of a nerd, and I interpret things way too literally.\n\nBack in the day, if you wanted to be friends with someone, there wasn't a platform to just search for someone's name and add them on Snapchat. You had to literally walk up to them, find out if they were interested in talking to you, get a piece of paper, write down their phone number, and you could call each other as long as you both were at home at the same time. Otherwise you'd have to plan ahead and know where you could meet each other if you wanted to hang out. It required a genuine efforr to make friends, and the friendships I did develop were extremely important to me.\n\nNow we have this culture where friends are treated like a commodity that you can just add or remove with a single click. People treat other people like they're disposable, like using a napkin and throwing it away once you're done with it. Nobody values friendships because it requires so little effort to find new people.\n\nI went on a date a couple years back, and I really liked this girl but she literally could not go 3 minutes without checking Facebook. So I didn't even bother with a 2nd date, because why would I want to date someone that's already dating their phone? I see this all the time too, especially with the generation younger than me are college aged. People will literally \"hang out\" and just stare at their phones the whole time without ever interacting with each other. The art of conversation has been lost. Which is particularly frustrating for me because I had a hard time learning how to make friends in the first place, and now it's a completely different ballgame with how people socialize.\n\nIt's just like that episode of South Park where Stan doesn't want anything to do with Facebook.\n\nhttps://youtu.be/qEE1E0EQbuk\n\nExcept this is the real world now, and I'm Stan.

Maybe she even came up to you and tried talking to you. But you had no idea how to respond. Didn't have enough confidence to ask her out. Was too shy or socially awkward and ended up regretting it for days afterwards. This is basically me.\n\nI remember seeing a video on YouTube one time. I couldn't find the link, maybe it was taken down, but the title was something along the lines of \"Life is made out of seconds: this is one of them.\" It showed a girl and a guy in a cafeteria, apparent strangers, smiling slightly flirtatiously at each other. The video then went on to talk about how many seconds are in a day, a year, a lifetime, etc., and shows all the things they would do together, from getting married, buying their first house, to having kids, attending their own kids' weddings and graduations and then finally growing old together and living together in the same nursing home. It was so beautiful but the catch was, and this was not revealed until the end, that this is not what happened but merely what *would* happen. Then, at the end, it zooms back into the original interaction, and it turns out they were both too shy to make a move so they didn't talk to each other and presumably never saw each other again.\n\nThis has been me on multiple occasions. I should be happy when a girl seems interested but the moment I sense any interest I freeze and don't know what to do. I am also almost mortally terrified of making a complete idiot of myself and her reacting by rejecting me in an embarrassing way that is evident to everyone in the immediate vicinity so I feel ashamed to even look people in the eye. So I usually hold off. But because I hold off it feels like my life is slipping away in front of my eyes and there's nothing I can do about it. Maybe if I were bolder, I'd happily be in a relationship by now, heck, I might even be married with kids. But I'm not bold. Instead I'm love-shy and all those opportunities have slipped away. Those girls who could have been mine are probably sleeping blissfully in the arms of their boyfriends right now, unaware even of my existence. It wasn't supposed to be this way, but this is how it's ended up. I feel defeated and shattered. Here I am at 26, almost 27 and still a virgin. I always imagined that when I'd be 21 at the oldest I'd be vacationing with my girlfriend in the tropics or something, we'd live together and be all inseparable lovey-dovey and what not, but this isn't the way it has ended up and it just makes me feel extremely sad.", "subreddit": "ForeverAlone"}

I pretty much accepted my lot in life.  Exactly four months ago, out of nowhere I had the following thought: right now there is a depressed dog alone in a kennel.  Like me, this dog is alone in the world, and is probably afraid.  I kept thinking about this dog I never met.  After three days of this, I went to the county animal shelter, and they were really nice there.  A woman showed me the dogs, a lot of them barking and jumping around.  I asked her if any of them were sad or depressed.  She said yes, and brought me to a shepherd mix named Scrubs.  Right away I knew Scrubs was for me.  Scrubs is 7 years old, kind of scruffy looking, and I was told that his family left him behind, and for the past three months Scrubs was not adopted and just sat in his cage depressed.  The very next day I brought Scrubs home, and it was a great decision.  It took about three days for him to even trust me and come out of his shell.  We went on walks, I gave him treats, and generally we just hung out together.  Gradually he started getting happier, and I did too.  Today we are very closely bonded.  I feel that my life has a new purpose, which is to love Scrubs and make sure he will never be abandoned or lonely again.  I am still FA, but he has enriched my life tremendously.

And because of that I feel like I can't talk to people I'm close with on the team, especially him.\n\nLiking him has made it so much harder for me to express the dumbest things and now everything has built up to this and I hate it. He jokes about how lonely he is but I'm too afraid to react and now my stress over him has become uncontrollable because it now includes stress over school work/other personal problems as well.\n\nNeeded to vent, so I guess that's why I'm here... I guess I'll take advice too.", "subreddit": "lonely"}

I went to a party a couple of days ago and talked to maybe 2-3 people. Throughout the entire thing I still felt like I was on the outside, just watching things and almost feeling non-existent to others.

I kissed one of my mates' ex girlfriend (of 3 months) who i also had dated 8 years previously and at the time still was good friends with her so its not like it was some random revenge thing, it was unplanned and spontaneous and that was that. I had a chance to apologise but couldnt believe i was expected to do this to someone who wasn't even dating this girl at the time and in conversations previous to this he would say how free he feels and implied he had no feelings for her anymore. \n\nA couple of months later i started dating a girl i had been friends with for several years. A couple of months into this i had a sudden slap in the face, kinda out of no where realising how lonely i   was. The only person i had spent time with for the past few months was this girl im dating. This realisation came about as i was due to give her a lift to spend the weekend with mates of hers for a birthday celebration. I tried to explain how i felt at the time but it didn't really go anywhere and i dropped her off to her mates. \n\nA couple days pass with out no real contact and after some time trying to see what was going on, tied in with other stresses not related to this current situation, i foolishly cut my shoulder several times. I haven't self harmed for almost 10 years, and the next day it made me even worse, now along with the feeling of loneliness, i was filled with regret and despair. I thought i had got over my teenage feelings of low mood but it seems not at the moment. Despite not replying to my messaged for several days, she instantly replied when i mentioned ''i did a silly''. I explained what happened and unexpectedly she reacted very badly and not very well. A whole week passes from this with again, no contact until she says sorry but what i did really freaked her out and she didn't know what to say or do at the time. I think she was drunk or high at the time. \n\n\\*\\*Again a couple weeks later we kind of start talking occasionally until a couple days ago at 4am i got a call from her crying down the phone (drunk) saying how sad she is and cant stop crying and how she misses me. After this call, we message each other for some time  and exchange cute pictures of us and it gets pretty emotional and cute. We end the conversation that night with i love u both ways. The following day i see her and give her a lift home. I cant help but feel though at this time i am just being used as a free taxi service. We had made plans for the following day to spend the evening together and i spend all of that day looking forward to it, even leaving work 3 hours early to do so. When i left work, i tried calling, and calling, and calling, and calling. 4 hours later, i was getting pretty frustrated, so decided to go and knock on her door. She looked surprised and said she wasn't ignoring me but had been cleaning the house with her sister. Right, okay, what ever. But that was okay because she said shed see me in 2 hours after she'd finished and had a shower. I went to another job of mine to do some cleaning, send off some items and go in the gym for a while. 3 hours pass and nothing. I get a message saying sorry shes feeling hungover and sick and has been asleep. \n\nIm starting to loose my shit. I wish  i could simply cut her off because its so much stress. I like having a plan and she is always going back on them leaving me at the last minute. But its not that easy because she is the only close mate i have left after falling out with a lot of my mates. \n\nWhat would you do in my situation? Im terrible with confrontation and not the finest people person so find it hard at the best of time when a relationship is going well. \n\nI cant simply go off and make new friends because im constantly working, one job not so enjoyable but the other is as a firefighter and i love it. But for this reason i cant really socialise that easily and old mates from years back are all the wrong kind of crowd, smoking and doing other drugs and i cant be mixing with that anymore. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSorry for the longwindedness of this, i had to get it all out as no one else will listen right now. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n tl;dr fall out with all my mates, find relationship with a two year friend of mine, relationship turns out more stressful than i imagined", "subreddit": "lonely"}

She said she would love to but she wants to take it slow and wants us to get to know each other more before diving in. We watched a movie together on one of our dates at my house and she kinda cuddled with me so that was good.\n\nSo it\u2019s still hopeful but I\u2019m still terrified that it\u2019ll fall through and that she\u2019ll see the bad side of me and lose interest :(", "subreddit": "ForeverAlone"}

{"post_id": "dusvej", "created_utc": 1573481365, "title": "I admit it, I do resent almost everyone and learning new hobbies has made it much worse", "author": "wegwerf_physik", "self_text": "So basically I have been a shut in since I am 10 (I am now 23). No friends, just the occasional acquaintance, sometimes not even that. No girlfriend of course though I also never tried. Paralyzed by social anxiety and in the last few years by depression.\n\nAfter slowly working on myself I finally got the courage to try things out. I started playing badminton three times a week and started to learn lindy hop. \n\nHere is what I observed. Bare in mind that I take a great deal about personal hygiene. I brush my teeth, floss and mouth wash always after eating, shower two times a day, always wear clothes which have been washed before. I get a haircut every 3-4 weeks and nobody would think of me as FA when looking at me. So again, here is what I observed:\n\n1. Most people suck at small talk and nobody will approach you, especially if you are a guy. You literally have to initiate 99% of interactions. It is not just to me but seeing how normies talk with other normies. How normies even make friends beyond the ones they made at school or kindergarten is beyond me. For example, everytime before the class starts people are waiting. Literally everybody is staring at their phones besides the people who came together.\n\n2. Most normies are **REALLY** scared of taking responsibility in group situations to the point that even someone timid like me gets impatient and starts making the decisions. For example in badminton we always play doubles. To start you throw the shuttlecock up and when it falls, the direction it points to, that team will start to serve. Even something simple like this will take normies like 5 min to decide who throws the fu***** shuttlecock up. Don't get me even started about when the game ends. We go to the net and give high fives and say \"well played!\". Then normies will stand there nobody looking at each other, standing there in silence, everybody waiting for one person to decide to say \"let's play another game!\" or \"let's change teams!\". Sometimes I say nothing (act like them) just to see how long it takes for someone to make a decision. Longest has been 1 min. Imagine 4 people standing there less than a meter apart from each other and facing each other for 60 seconds. Yet these same people talk about that \"cool party\" they went on friday or saturday night.\n\n3. Similar to the initiating I talked about in point 1, normies won't ever invite you outside unless you **REALLY, REALLY** hit it off because that takes initiative or courage. It is up to yourself to ask them out to do stuff outside, again especially as a guy. \n\n4. Partner Dancing seems like a dating simulator. Leaders (99% guys) **have** to ask out followers (99% women). The pressure is on the leader to make the dance fun, even if everybody tells otherwise, just like how it is the guys responsibility to \"woo\" the girl and initiate the kiss and sex. If you are a beginner leader  (analogous to shy, ugly or boring or combination of these type of guy) most followers have this bored, cold look on their face like their parents just died or something. There seems to be zero empathy on how hard it is to lead (to be a guy in dating and pursue). Beginner followers easily can have fun on the social dances after just a few lessons (analogous to how there are much much much less FA women than FA men for the same reasons). Advanced leaders are even accepting and like to show them some tricks (analogous how even mentally ill women usually have boyfriends while the guy with the same illness is alone because guys like to take care of girls).\n\n5. Normies are flaky as fuck. You think you had a good conversation and then they will say it was nice seeing, next time we will play/dance again and then they won't show up. Some even leave after they showed up 3 or 5 times and some only show up randomly like once every 4 times. How these people ever found their friends if they spent so little time with other people, I don't know. \n\nAnd there is much more. But that's the reason why I resent almost everyone because let's face it, being FA is like 0,01% of the population. Most normies never had to do anything to get their friends and relationships. Things just happened to them. Most of them don't work even slightly for it. Yet they give ridiculous advice like \"just approach people at a cafe and talk to them bro!\". Most people (remember 0,01% are FA) don't have to do shit like this and won't do shit like this if they ever find themselves in our situation. **NO NORMIE AND CERTAINLY 99% OF PEOPLE WHO GIVE ADVICE HERE HAVE EARNED THEIR PLACE**", "subreddit": "ForeverAlone"}

I know I've just not found my \"tribe\" so to speak, and I isolate a lot, but I just find it hard to get along with people who I can tell are not as intelligent; it's hard for me not to be judgemental. Even if I like someone, I know there is a depth there that I can't explore with them. I love psychology and looking at the human brain, genetics, neuroscience, but I still appreciate learning about things I don't know much about. \n\nAnyway, let me know if you feel a similar way sometimes.

So if anyone is interested in making a new friend or just talking to someone, I'm here.\n\nHere's some info about me: My hobbies include gaming, photography, art, writing/poetry, my pets, etc. I also have interests in true crime, goth culture, rap/rock/metal/alternative music. I'm up to talking with anyone, even if we don't have any similar interests. I just provided those to give some insight on myself. I'm also 15, going to be 16 on January 22nd, so not too far away. I don't care what ages contact me as long as it stays appropriate. I use other platforms to talk as well, these include Discord, Kik, Snapchat, emails, and even exchanging numbers if needed (however, I won't right away, there needs to be some trust built for that). Also, I'm just going to mention, there is no need to worry about my mental health getting in the way of anything. I won't let it ruin my chances of making friends and being happy.

We exchanged numbers and then I noticed the the pattern of very short responses or not responding at all so I stopped texting (don't want to be one of those guys that overtexts) and then she told me that she is very busy and has a lot on her plate when I brought up meeting for coffee.  I plan on being friendly and stuff because she is a cool person and I'll never give a woman a hard time for not being interested because that is life.  I remember when I was younger I used to actually think that a woman who said she had a lot going on when I asked her out on a date wasn't actually saying no and I would ask again like a week or two later.  It took a woman telling me she was sick, busy, and then standing me up to finally realize that if a woman is really interested, she will make an effort.  My best friend met his wife when they were both working multiple jobs so that kind of drove the point home for me along with single mother co-workers who met guys they liked and found a way to get to know them.

I'm 39 and I can see why a younger FA can come to that conclusion because I used to when would see all the guys I knew who treated women horribly but never had trouble getting a girlfriend.  Growing up it was drilled in my head that personality was more important than looks (at very best I'm average or maybe slightly below average) so I was guilty as a teen of saying that women want losers out of frustration but over time I realize that looks are important.  Even today if a beautiful woman was into me and there were red flags I'm sure I'd overlook them.  I just hate how all these online articles don't understand the difference between the \"nice guy\" and a guy who is frustrated with constant rejection.

I'm part of a fairly large friend group but every single one of them is in a relationship. It only really started this year but I only ever see my friends during lunch at school and even then they're usually with their SO so it feels like I'm third wheeling when I try to talk to them. I basically just spend my weekends at home or at my job that I hate but it's just gotten really difficult to cope with. I used to be so close with all the people in my friends group and since they all got in relationships and have jobs I don't even really talk with them over social media. My best friend not only got into a relationship and became somewhat of a stoner (I don't have any problems with smoking weed, I do it sometimes, I just believe that people change when they become stoners) and it's been really hard to connect with her which sucks because I considered her my platonic soulmate. Since it's my senior year it's supposed to be exciting and fun but I don't really see anybody ever and am kind of just being hit with the huge feeling of isolation. Even if I wanted to sit somewhere else or branch out, all the other students in my grad class have their own friend groups and I only really like maybe a few of the students not in mine. It sucks feeling like I can't even branch out to other people or groups who I'd possibly enjoy being around more.

No one really cared about me. In elementary school, I felt like a lot changed. I have friends now, I used to tell to myself. The reality was rough. I was still considered a weirdo, I was bullied, and only had a handful of friends. I didn\u00b4t care back then. You could say I was actually happy. Always buried deep in my mind. People always told me that I live in my own private world inside my head. They were right. I loved being closed inside my mind. I felt like I\u00b4m in heaven. I never really cared about talking because why the fuck should I.\n\n But then I hit puberty and oh boy it fucked me up. One day I felt a little bit down. Well, it was just a shitty day, I thought.

I was a good student so I teach them, wrote their homework, tried to be a good friend. They didn\u00b4t care. Thay still thought I was weird.

We ended up just watching netflix and falling asleep in her dorm together.\n\nThe next night we threw a party at this air bnb, before everyone came over me and this girl we\u2019re hanging out and ended up telling each other a bunch of secrets. She told me \u201cI\u2019ve never hooked up with someone and not caught feelings for them.\u201d Which kinda shocked me because I already knew I had caught feelings for this girl. \n\nLater that night we were drunk and ended up hooking up finally but it didn\u2019t go well. She completely ignored me for the rest of the night and my friend said she even called her ex who she recently broke up with. My friend ended up driving her back to her dorm that night. \n\nThe next morning she sent me a text apologizing, blaming it on the fact that we were both too drunk. I was pissed so I didn\u2019t accept it, and we ended up getting in a fight and stopped talking for a while. Eventually I texted her apologizing for being immature just because I missed talking to her. \n\nSo as of right now we\u2019re on good terms, but have stopped talking. And I cannot stop thinking about her. I was so close to moving on until she sent me a snapchat and I instantly lost all the progress I was making. What should I do? Did I mess up by not accepting her apology right away? Should I ask if she caught feelings too, since she told me that secret about catching feelings for all her hookups? Should I just try and move on? I\u2019m scared if I wait till next semester she might move on from me. Thank you if you read all this.", "subreddit": "lonely"}

Was bullied in school and had trouble making friends. Loneliness and sadness was with me always. I see so many posts on this forum that really make me sad.\n\nSo, I want to share some of the things I did to break this cycle. I call it becoming an adapted introvert. Some of this applies even if you aren't a total introvert so please stay with me.\n\nHere is what I have observed and I hope, really hope it helps someone else. There are other things but I want to keep this post from being too long.\n\n***First observation***: No matter how weird you think you are or are a misfit you can find friends and make relationships. I know, I am quite different and this is why I was tormented so much in school. I am quite the misfit. However, being different can make you interesting to others if you use it to your advantage.\n\n***Second observation:*** If you want to have interesting conversation try making your life more diverse. What I am saying is find things you like to do and learn new things. Take a community  class on painting, music or something that interests you and try to learn. If your doing something interesting in life it makes it easier to talk to people. Take up a hobby or activity that you are interested in. In doing and learning the activity you'll likely meet people with things in common with you. Practice talking to people and also prepare yourself for conversation when your alone. Think about the things you are interested in and want to talk about.\n\n***Third observation:*** If you have pain in your life work on it. Self reflection and actually feeling the pain will help with healing. If you can find a friend in this process or go to helping groups in your town it will help speed the process.\n\n***Fourth observation:*** We are all connected and part of this universe we live in. Take a new attitude, say to yourself: This is my world and I will write my own story. What I am saying is take action to make your story read the way you like and want it to. I know this is challenging but give it a try.\n\nI recommend looking up Jim Cary's Commencement speech (uncut) or Ekhart Tolle's videos on Youtube. BTW, I don't necessarily buy into everything any \"expert\" says but I see value in much of what they say, it's up to each one of us to sort through things like this. There are lots of inspirational things out there to evaluate for yourself.\n\n [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TV-tA8njqq8](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TV-tA8njqq8) \n\nAnyway, chime in if you have ideas or want to ask me (not an expert just another person here) more about how I made it through the loneliness.\n\nNicholas", "subreddit": "lonely"}

But I feel like a lot of the reasons that I am so quiet and refuse to speak to almost everyone and feel bad about myself for these reasons is partly society's fault. \n\nI am very introverted. I admit that I have a problem that needs to be worked on, however, society is approaching the subject wrong. If you can even say they're approaching it at all. For as long as I can remember, I have always had trouble interacting with other people. Iv'e gone to therapy appointment after therapy appointment. And all of them have done very little for me obviously. Considering that my social anxiety keeps getting worse the longer I go without talking to people. There has been no real effort made to get me to interact with others. My parents know that my loneliness is having a negative effect on my mental health. I'm not sure how long they've known this, but the last time I remember directly addressing the issue in front of them was at a therapy appointment several months ago. The last real effort I remember that someone tried to get me to interact with someone was in 5th grade, when my school counselor arranged meetings with a kid that I was somewhat friendly with, but still awkward around him. That didn't work out. That was the year before I went to Middle School. And that's when things really got bad. Ever since then, everyone has been telling me to put myself out there. But it's so hard. I have been doing exposure therapy recenetley, where I will do stuff in public to make me more comfortable around people, and while it has definitely helped with some things, it has not helped me establish stable relationships with people. And that's what I need. The exposure stuff helps with me talking out loud. But what they don't realize is that I used to talk out loud all the time. And I was still very lonely. Talking out loud is just the first step of a marathon. I feel like nowhere is this more evident then a time in 3rd grade, when I got invited to a kids birthday party. In 3rd grade, I was somewhat of a class clown. And I guess this kid I knew who I was friendly with decided to invite me because he enjoyed being around me. Getting invited to his birthday party was the easy part, when I actually got to the party, I was a complete mute. I had never done anything like this before and I was so anxious. I just felt awkward and out of place there. And I didn't know what to do or say. The other kids at the party basically ignored me for most of the time and I kind of just sat by myself for a large chunk of the time. Looking back, that was a pivotal part of my childhood and the development of my identity. After that, I never attended any kind of social gathering. And 4th grade was the year I remember when my counselor tried to get two kids to interact with me. And like what happened in 5th grade, it simply didn't work out. I guess it was because I didn't have enough time to get to know them and really become comfortable around them. I'm the type of person who opens up to people really slowly and will only initiate conversations if I'm comfortable with you and I trust you. During my first year of preschool, I didn't talk to anyone. By the time 6th grade rolled up, and I entered middle school, I was in a completely new environment. I remember making friends with two kids that year. I don't know why, I guess I wasn't completely socially awkward yet and for some reason I felt comfortable with them, because they were the last people I would actually initiate conversation with and desire to be friends with. The older kids also made me uncomfortable. They would ask me questions and get on my nerves. And when I wouldn't talk to them, they would make fun of me. It is understandable if a 6th grader feels intimidated by the loud and older kids, but add this with already having social anxiety and it was complete. I'm not sure how to describe it, but the less time I spent with individuals, the more I viewed people as a collective body. And the more uncomfortable I was made by the older kids, who seemed to enjoy picking on the quiet kid, the more I felt intimidated and scared to interact with people. I developed this subtle distrust of people that seemed to eventually take over and it would become really difficult to interact with people. Around 6th or 7th grade was when I would not talk to anyone. Before I feel like I could talk to people but I was shy and didn't really want to. Now I was basically mute. I remember 6th grade being a particularity stressful year. And I think the new environment really took a toll on me, in addition to spending less time talking to kids, which I also blame on the new environment. By 7th grade, the two kids that I made friends with last year weren't there. And now I was alone. The only two people who I was comfortable with were gone. And I would not talk to anyone unless they talked to me first. And now, as a Junior in High School, this is where I'm currently at. \n\nThank you for reading my story. Some things happened because of luck. Like my two friends transferring schools. And I didn't add this but I transferred schools in 3rd grade and I didn't get to see my close friend from 2nd grade anymore. But I feel like a lot of things are also society's and individual peoples fault. The unfortunate reality is that no one cares about you unless you talk out loud. If your really introverted like me, people will treat you differently. They'll tease you, treat you like some kind of alien, instead of just treating you like a human. This can a take a toll on someones self esteem. I know it did with me. Their seems to be this expectation that you should talk to people or you are weird and abnormal. I view it as a lesser form of bullying. Ostracizing people who are different and are disadvantaged. I know that some of them are just messing with you and are light hearted, but it falls under the same umbrella of not showing common courtesy and not understanding people's situations. I personally feel like it is inappropriate to bring up the fact that people are quiet just because. I'm fine if I'm talking to someone and they mention I'm quiet, that's fine, but what you shouldn't do is just randomly bring it up. Maybe I'm overeating, but the things you say stick with me. I can still vividly remember people asking me questions like \"Why don't you talk?\". That stuff sticks with you and hits close to home. If someone does not talk at all, then it could mean a number of things. But very rarely do I feel like it is because they don't want to socialize with people. I know me and a lot of other people really want to socialize and form bonds with people. And when you ask someone a question like why don't you talk much, you are unintentionally showing that talking is good for you and should be something that people do. So the best thing to do is either leave it alone, or try to include them in stuff. Because you could really upset someone if you say stuff like that. And it shows our society's disregard for introverts. And especially for really introverted people like me. But the more I think about it, if this how we treat people who are different, maybe I don' want to be friends with people. Because that says a lot about you and how you think and do things around other people. Iv'e tried to take into account that the people who would tease and make fun of me for being quiet were just kids. But regardless, it shows that our society needs to do a better job of approaching and treating introverts. The world is like our home. And it would be very naive to think that we can just easily brush off rude comments and behaviors.", "subreddit": "lonely"}

I have a sister with special needs, and as a very young child, maybe 3, I have always remembered having to fight with my sister for my mother\u2019s attention, often times losing because of my sister\u2019s condition. My father isn\u2019t a very affectionate person, so I didn\u2019t seek his attention. \n\nWhen I was in elementary school, I would get bullied for being overweight, my mother would work from 3-11:30, so my sister would see my mother, but I wouldn\u2019t, not even on weekends. My father was an abusive alcoholic, he would drink a bottle and a half of wine, and then he would beat me, for various reasons he felt was necessary, and my sister being special needs with a mental disability, would be home, but because we always fought over my mothers attention she saw me as a rival, so she would beat me up, punch me, hit me, and I was not to hit her, because she\u2019s special needs. So I would wake up, and go to school alone, where I\u2019d get bullied and beat up, come home to an abusive sister, and an abusive father, and cry myself to sleep for 10 years. \n \nUntil I hit 14, and I went to high school, met people and thought my luck was turning around, finally people who cared about me, until I got to Sophomore year, where all the friends I had accumulated suddenly gave me the cold shoulder, almost speed walking to get out of range of me, and talking about me behind my back. Soon I went from having a group of friends I could count on, to feeling betrayed, and back to where I\u2019ve always been, alone for another 4 years. While at home, my father cut down on drink, but still a void had been missing in me for years, and I found temporary content in what most people would find it in as-well, video games. I would probably play for hours and hours, and eventually met some pretty cool people, but the long years of being made fun of and getting beat up took its toll, and my depression probably manifested before highschool, but I can\u2019t prove or remember it anymore.\n\nUpon going to University, I had a couple of online friends, and opted to go to a far university, hoping to find friends, and maybe any rumours or anything made up to prevent me from making friends wouldn\u2019t follow me here...but soon people who I felt I had a strong connection to, would begin avoiding me. It wasn\u2019t as noticeable, until I was talking to 2 of them, when a third pulls them, and begins to run, and looking behind them to see if I would chase. I would power walk a little, and they would keep running, and try to lose me. It wasn\u2019t my first time experiencing that in my life, so I know what it was, and I thought that i ran away from my problems, but everywhere I go, it seems I am the problem, incapable of making and maintaining friends.\n\nRecently, I\u2019ve felt that my depression makes me an unpleasant person to be around, so I deleted my Facebook, and removed every online friend I had, and gave away anything of value I could give them, as a compensation to the years they wasted with a subhuman parasite like myself. Now I sit in my home office, clicking away on my keyboard, once again alone. I go days, if not weeks really talking to anyone. Loneliness is a dark life, I\u2019ve somewhat lived my whole life, people were around me, but it\u2019s always just been in passing. I feel like it\u2019s no longer worth trying to make connections with anyone, because I know every friend I make, I lose them one way or another, by removing myself to benefit their lives. \n\nThanks for reading, I needed a place to write this; I don\u2019t expect to get friends, and I\u2019d somewhat request not to, it doesn\u2019t end well, and I\u2019d rather not waste anyone\u2019s time.", "subreddit": "lonely"}

I never really felt too close to them but I always appreciated being part of the crowd - like the player 4 in your Smash Bros. match or the designated driver at a social event. Even though I yearned for more, I was content with what I had. I knew where I fit in and being the socially awkward person that I am - I didn't feel comfortable asking for more.\n\nHowever, as time went on my large group of friends started drifting away. It was only natural that from the transition from High School to College that I'd lose half of my friends as they went out of town for work or school. That's fine, I understand. \n\nIt's also fine that in my 20's that my group of 5 friends would slowly but surely get girlfriends or boyfriends or move away for work. I get it. I can't expect things to stay the same.\n\nThis year though, there were only three of us left and one of my friends just told me that he's taking a teaching gig over in another state after he's done with his PHD this year. I'm happy for him. He's doing what he loves and I'm sure he's going to have a great time chasing his dreams.\n\nThis month, my last remaining friend got engaged to his girlfriend of five years. I was the second person he called and I can still remember how excited he was. I want to be happy for him but he's been distant these last couple of years as he keeps cancelling plans to hang out. I don't blame him though, I want him to be happy and have him spend more time with someone he really cares about.\n\nThis last month has been particularly rough for me. I went out and took myself out for a \"date\" of sorts a couple times to go and see a couple of movies, a restaurant I always wanted to visit and a comedy show to see Bill Burr. I think I was fine at the time but I just can't help but feel like I'm hollowing inside out. It's a tough feeling to describe and I'm not sure if it's the right word but *hollowing* is the first term that comes to mind.\n\nI've never had much luck with dating apps and while I'll get a date once a blue moon, getting second dates with the same person is practically unheard of - less so when it comes to a third or fourth date.\n\nI've tried Meetup.com from a recommendation I read here but I always feel like I'm intruding on a clique or like I'm eavesdropping. Maybe I haven't tried hard enough and haven't been to \"the right group\" - that's entirely fair and I'll work myself up to keep trying but I can't help but feel worried about my future. I know that it's somewhat cliched to say that my life didn't turn out how I had wanted it to but I never expected to feel this socially isolated and to dread what the future might hold.\n\nI can empathize that I'm probably asking the wrong crowd but how can I learn to make new friends in real life? I love and appreciate the friends that I have made online but it could just be that I'm wired the wrong way and that I crave human contact even at the most basic level.\n\nI really don't know where I'm going with this post and if you took the time to read this, I appreciate it.

Gonna be pretty eventful and I'm struggling through it all.\u00a0\n\n\nMy parents were highschool lovers (as I've been told) and when my mom was 17 she decided it was a good fucking idea to get pregnant. So stuff led to other stuff and BAM I was born.\n\n\nYears later and my dad wasn't in my life AT ALL until something tragic happened. My grandmother on my mother's side passed away with me in the bed with her, only me. My mom sent me to live with my grandma on my dad's side that day(I hate that a tragedy like that happened for me to be set free, I escaped a life of depression)\n\n\nSo days later and it's the funeral, my mom put my other 2 younger brothers in the car with her but 5 year old me? I had to ride with someone else. (Note: I was supposed to have 3 younger brothers but one died from asphyxia at birth and he was supposed to be my twin, at least that's what I've been told)\n\n\nSo years later and I'm going through many hardships in my life. Grandpa on my mom's side also passed away, I get retained in the fifth grade, I get bullied ALOT in middle school.\n\n\nThen my mom thought it would be a great decision to take me from my other grandparents when I'm 12( I'm just starting puberty so holy hell am I confused about EVERYTHING). I ran away for the first time and went missing for 2 weeks. Until I'm found and my mom just takes me to her apartment.\n\n\nShe had a new boyfriend and he was TERRIBLE. he made us do everything for him(like taking out the trash in the rain at 3am and sweeping up trash in the snow without a jacket and long pants) and my mom didn't have her own opinions, he made every decision for her. Until one day I started rebelling, I failed all my classes and tests from 7th grade to 9th and miraculously made it to 10th. I showed literally no emotions and had a grin on my face 24/7 They stuck me in a room with no blanket, mattress or even a pillow, and I couldn't come out no matter what, not even to eat.\n\n\nThis goes on for 4 years, I'm 16 now and ever since President's day of this year I've been back living with my grandparents on my dad's side. It's fun and all but I don't have my own room, nor do I have a bed, and a loving father. He's still as distant as always.\n\n\nI dont know if I can take the pain anymore, I'm not suicidal but feel as if i will snap and hurt someone else or myself.

With that said, there's this girl in my class. I usually sit next to her. I talked to her once in class for a group assignment, and then nothing else after that. I told this to a kinda (I hate using this term) normie friend, and he told me to go for it. After midterms, I started talking to her regularly. It was cool getting to know her, in the parts where we weren't talking about the weather, but still, talking. Throughout the semester, I noticed that she was on her phone a lot, specifically on chats, but I tried not to put too much thought into that. Cut to today, we were talking about where she moved from, and she said that she had a desire for going back, and that she's trying to convince her boyfriend to move with her.\nIt didn't faze me at first, but when class started and the professor started talking, I started to digest it.\nI had the thought of making a post like this in my head, but I saw it as just a negative thought and hopefully, if everything turned out right, I'd never have to come here to make this post. Yet, here I am, making this post. I've been listening to music to help deal with this. She's the only girl I've ever made an effort to get to know, with the hope to gather up enough courage to ask her out and see where that went. Yeah, no.

The farther you are, the bigger the picture, and the closer you get the more sensitive you are. Being this high strung is instantly discomforting for most people to encounter, but that's mainly because their mind set comes from a dependent structure.\n\nMost people rely on thinking patterns from others to navigate and build the structure of their overall lives. It's like a pack or a herd, a group of dependability and togetherness that mutually benefits the survival of the group's ideals. The group shapes the identity of the individual.\n\nBut for the outcast, they have to figure out their own methods of survival. They can no longer identify themselves with the rest of that pack, making them an animal all of their own. Baring the similar physicality of the group they were born out of, but something on the inside had set them apart. They have to evolve from a dependent to an independent structure of mentality in order to live. They will have to see things in a different light based on the context of their severe situation.  \n\nThose who operate in groups see the world based on how that group interacts with the rest of the world. They are granted certain advantages and can shape their environment based on their collective preference which is suitable for their well being. The outcast struggles in shear contrast with the rest of the world, and operate in it as though they don't belong. They weren't given the opportunity to thrive comfortably, and now reside mostly in the shadows, under cover. Living as a frail or feral beast, concealing their presence, would often hide or lash out to the rest of the world because it finds no comfort in trusting what would bring potential harm.\n\nThe interesting part is knowing the heart of this beast, and realizing that it longs for the warmth of a family. Deep seeded circumstances brought it to this state, now they wander the planet searching for sanctuary.

I don't think I'm really ugly, right now I'm probably 5/10. But there was a time, when I was 16-17yo, when I was really trying and I looked very good. I did not realize how good I looked back then, I thought I still look like shit, but I saw some photos of 17yo me not too long ago... Also I'm 195cm (6'4\") tall with adequately wide bodytype, right now that is my biggest and maybe only quality. But when I was 17 and thought that riding 23km on a bicycle in 1 hour ^((and it was 50% offroad 50% road on MTB. The road was biggest pain...)^), and then working out for another 30 mins every single day was doing nothing with my looks I stopped. Now I'm overweight.  \nI think I needed to stop caring about how fat I am or how I look to be able realize that I was not an obese blob, that I was actually fit. And realizing it took few years too, since I realized that only a year ago...\n\n...But now I think it's too late for me. I think I'm not ready for normal relationship or \"non-committal\" sex. ^((the \"non-committal\" was google's idea, it sounds really wierd to me...)^) I think I'm still like a 12 year old when it comes to relationships/dating or sex. By this I mean that I just want to kiss, hold hands and cuddle. Hey, I think I still want to play the bottle or other kissing/makeout games I never got to experience... And I think I'm not ready for sex, even though I really want it...  \nI'm not ready to move on from this mindset, to \"grow up\" even though I never really experienced the \"growing up\"...\n\nI actually feel very uncomfortable with the idea of dating someone with more experience than me, by that I don't only mean sex, I mean everything from kissing to just dating... I had this feeling for a long time, maybe since I was 15 but I always thought it's bullshit that I should ignore, but it grew stronger the older I was. But the feeling applies only to relationships, dating or sex and for some reason not to the kissing games like the bottle ^((that's one reason I mentioned it)^) and I don't know why, maybe you can help me explain it...  \nEver since I got this feeling it gave me fear that I would date a girl and that she would really like me, but that I would not be able get over that she had someone before me. That I would be unable to be with her because of it, and that I would hurt her with that. I don't want to dump a girl because she kissed someone and I did not. Maybe I would have to find a girl that is like me a kissless, dateless virgin, but I don't know how to spot or even find one, if she was like me she would be hiding home waiting to die... Does girls like this even exist? When I was leaving middle school (9th class 15yo) I was actually the only person from my class to never date and kiss anyone...\n\nThe biggest problem is that a relationship is the only thing I really want, the only life goal I have...\n\nEdit:  \nI feel like I should give you a short list of my other life problems I did not include in the original text \n\n* I was heavily bullied at middleschool and developed something like PTSD and I was unable to even complete the first half of the first year in high school because of it. There were 5 attempts, one every single year except this one...\n\n* I never found a job I would like or want, let alone aspire to do. In fact all jobs I ever heard about are either jobs I wouldn't be ever able to force myself to do or jobs I would hate to do... And the jobs I can do with my \"education\" and abilities are just those I wouldn't be able force myself to do. Even though I car repair bicykles and motorbikes and work with wood (and use the tools) quite well you need high school certificate for that here in Czech Republic ^((Well you are required to have high school even to carry boxes in warehouse here in Czech Republic so...)^) and I would actually hate to do all of the three things, especially the woodworking because I actually find it very stressful, but it's great when you finish it. I love to work on my bike, but that is because working on your own motorcycle is kinda \"romantic\" and not having to give it to someone else for the service is cheaper.\n\n* I have some other problems like my phobia of mind-altering substances, so I can't take meds like antidepressives. I also can't ever drink alcohol because of that, and I hate it for other reasons too, but that is a big problem because drinking is huge part of czech culture and sometimes it's even considered rude not to do drink... I'm the only person who doesn't drink I know. I also really hate being around drunk people. This makes it very hard to make friends, I have none.\n\n* I also have bad allergy on tabacco smoke. I can't breathe in rooms where the smoke is. This makes finding job even harder because even though smoking in public indoor places is banned in Czech Republic it's still common at workplaces.", "subreddit": "ForeverAlone"}

I've felt pain for many things; feeling stuck, seeing friends going away from my path, being lovesick, having horrible intrusive thoughts, self-inflicted injuries and just plain old anxiety attacks, but this time I just feel desperate enough that I, a person that is shy even online, that gets nervous when chatting and can't normally do it, wants to scream into the void of the internet, with some hope.\n\nThe pain that's been consuming my flesh is caused because of a breakup I had three months ago with my first girlfriend. Two years nine month long relationship btw.\n\nI am seeing the person I love the most, who has loved my heart and my first friend very much in many years, moving away as far and as fast as she can. And I get that it won't be the same as before, I'm ok with just being a friend like she asked me to be because I just want to see her grow and be happy, I want to see her smile and make her proud. \n\nA day ago at night I saw one picture of her through a third party that published the photo, she looked stunning, she made the changes to her hair that she always told me she wanted and that I always supported her to get, she was dressed with a beautiful black leather jacket and red lipstick, smiling genuinely because she wanted and not because her mother was pushing her to. I felt happy for her, she looked great, not all her problems where solved but she was pushing through and she would make it, there I realized how much I still love her. \n\nAt the same time I felt my throat combusting, it wasn't even my heart (that was beating like crazy but it didn't pain me as much, idk maybe it just went numb) but what I had used all those times to calm her down from her severe anxiety attacks and ptsd, my voice and words. It hasn't stopped burning since yesterday, like a candle getting kindled, burning everything near and above, my vocal cords and my head.\n\nShe is happier without me and the farther she goes she seems to be better, I feel that she hates me, I fear that she hates me, anyone could take my place and be better at what I had put my heart and soul on for almost three years and help her better than I never could. I have no value as a friend, because even if she told me that you wanted me to stay as a close friend  she still pushed me away further and further like it was no problem. I'm replaceable, meaningless and disposable as I had always thought.\n\nI just want to cry but my tears can't come out, to scream and shout I want to know that I'm still here, I want someone to acknowledge that I exist even if I have to shred my throat and vocal cords, but I can't, no sound comes but I'm still screaming. The candle on my throat doesn't stop burning, but maybe my hands could extinguish such a candle if they press hard enough.\n\nI'm tired and also scared, I don't feel more pain, but my heart has been unable to feel anything since some days ago. I don't want to stop feeling, I don't want to disappear from my own mind.\n\nIf I stop feeling anything entirely I just prefer dying while I'm still myself; the lovesick and love-struck, always memeing bastard that loved acting and talking like Ralsei, that always tried and hammered his head to use the correct words to make anyone that he could make feel a bit better, feel a bit better, that coward that always practiced in his head what he was gonna say a thousand times and then sometimes got to scared to say a word, that 18 year-old child that laughed at any joke as hard as he could while banging any near table. I can't go back to being a husk again, I don't want to.\n\nI don't even know if I really want to die, I just want to be a friend, her friend. I'm so sorry.", "subreddit": "lonely"}

She was 19, very Shy, not very good looking and seemed very unexperienced with men. I as 29yo FA was hoping for a Chance with her. \n\nShe acted really nervous around me, laughed and giggled a lot about my Jokes and stuff. She told me multiple times something I would translate to english with \" I cant figure you out, im out of my head around you\". \n\nThen at one time she said that she know knows why she feels that way around me, I said that i was excited to know!!! She then said that I remind of that Ugly Character Randall from the series \"Recess\"..\n\nI didnt expect that at all.. She was dead for me at that Moment. She even approached me a lot after this but I couldnt talk to her anymore and ignored her.\n\nFun Fact: She is now in a Partnership with the only other Man in the Kinder Garden Teacher class who is pretty fat, a nerd and dumb too but at least self-confident.

He says that he liked her the day he talked to her. He devised schemes and straight up lied to her to spend more time with her, like her teaching him to drive stick even tho he's always known. He only told her this after they got married, cause there's no way she would be so kind to him if he was *honest* with her and straight up said 'hey, I really like you and want to marry you'. She thought they were just friends, meanwhile he probably jerked off to her in the shower.\n\nSo I guess the lesson is that if you like a girl, don't let her know cause that's creepy and impulsive and weird.

I was young and naive, we had major differences, so it didn't work out. That was over a decade ago. For the vast majority of my life, I've been single. I would look with a jealous eye at others who had beautiful, loving relationships. I would watch movies and TV that had these beautiful love stories that I so badly want in my life. I would see beautiful women everywhere, and want to talk to them but figured they've been through enough shit, so I don't want to add to it, especially from someone like me who isn't conventionally attractive. Despite that shit, over the years, I'm learning to love myself more and more with each day. I'm still learning in general and trying to be the best person I can be. I'm not perfect, nor obviously, will I ever be. But I still want someone to love, and a loving, team effort, supportive relationship. I still *need* that love...\n\nCome this week where I have a really awesome first date. We had an awkward cute kiss at the end. I was nervous as fuck the entire time. I knew I wanted to see her again as soon as possible. I felt a connection, both of us are refreshingly honest with each other, and it just felt *good*. We talked for hours on the phone the next night and the night after that.\n\nBut that's kind of where the problem began.\n\nHaving been so fucking lonely for so many fucking years hurts so fucking bad. I do my best to live life with this pain, via medication, via therapy, but man, it rears its ugly fucking head from time to time. It manifests itself by being pushy and needy. I can't even help it. At times it feels like I'm not even in control and I'm watching this horror show from far away. This fear of losing that connection becomes life and death-like. Panic ensues, anxiety takes over, can't think straight, can't sleep well, simply can't function properly, and so I do really stupid shit. And of course, it pushes that person away. Understandably so. Rightfully so.\n\nAnd so I sit alone again, just wondering why the fuck I can't control that pushy and needy urge, why after so many years of therapy and books and meditation or whatever the fuck I've been doing to try and better myself, why can't I control it?

I also have to deal with student debt. I lived on campus through all of college  and I still didnt make friends, I wont remember anything in middle school,  high school,  or college; its going to be just a big blur.\n\nMy memories consist of me going back to my dorm after every class, roommate ocassionally complaining I stay in too much, and I would sometimes spend many hours in a computer lab just to stay outside. At least I have my own room now, where I can be forever alone on campus.\n\nI don't even think my family loves me, I never been a fun or sociable person. Sometimes they forget I am even in a car with them or at a restaurant, strangers even pointed out how quiet i was at a restaurant with my family,  like i was a weird spectacle at a zoo. Its been like this since I was a little girl.\n\nWhy does everyone else,  including children,  have more of a personality than me? I never know what to talk about to keep a conversation ongoing. My hobbies is rarely drawing anything creative or original, baking or cooking; but I never put a creative take on the recipes, and I don't even have any other hobbies. I don't have a favorite band, movie, or actor, the music I listen to isnt even English.

I go on youtube a lot but I cant even say what my favorite youtuber is or what I watch when someone asks me what I do when I'm on youtube. \n\nI have two memories that bother me, it was when a black out happened at home and me and my family were waiting it out. My brothers go up stairs to watch TV powered by the generator and I was still downstairs with my parents. My parents gradually got annoyed i was still downstairs with them and told me I should go upstairs. I go upstairs and I wanted to watch TV with my brothers, and one of them didnt want me to since we used to argue a lot and he doesnt like me for some reason (probably because I have no friends and I'm boring) and my other brother didnt want the potential of us arguing again so I decided to sit in my room where it was pitch black dark, and no one gave a shit. \n\nAnother memory is when my mother wanted to be alone in a hotel room when my brothers and my father went out to play a game and my mother stayed behind and I decided to stay as well and she suddenly got upset and said that I should go somewhere with her to do something and she made me go down to the lobby but I couldn't think of anything to do with her. So she got even more upset, and started saying I have no friends and that i am always alone and shy. She says all of this out loud so everyone can hear.. \n\nShe even said \"what is so scary about talking to people,  just talk! Its that simple\", she also said I probably had thoughts such as: \"Oh please dont talk to me\" or mockingly say \"conversation is oh sooo scary\".\n\nEven at home my family say I should go downstairs and not stay in my room all the time,  but even though, I know they would probably hate me and be bothered if I stayed downstairs with them,  at least I think.. \n\nI also have issues about my gender thorughout my whole life and I have been unconfident, timid, and shy my whole life.

Well non other than Jack Black from school of rock. \n\nAs the joker was drinking copious amounts of alcohol he was partying with these 18 year olds. The rest of us sitting in the back of the room. After about 30 minutes or so this girl comes up to us and ask us if any of us wants to dance with her. Beetlejuice and commissioner gordon immediately called out my name. Now I've never danced with a girl before but thankfully she was pretty good as realizing that and made it easy. \n\nI was actually really happy, my friends were estatic, they thought it finally happened. They thought I may have found a girl whose interested in me. As we were dancing about 30 seconds later a guy who was about 6'3 came up to us and said \"Hey mate, why are you touching my girlfriend?\"\nMyself only being 5'7 only replied with a simple but still a cheerful \"oh sorry mate, I didn't realize she was your girlfriend.\"\nFortunately he wasn't mad or anything and my friends were all bumbed about the fact she had a bf, well except for joker seeing that he was completely shit faced at this point and could only yell. \"You fucking Cucked a man, you fucking legend.\"\n\nThe rest of the night went without issue but I at least I got to dance with a random girl. \n\nWe did go back to the other bar and there were a lot of people there.

I asked her to lunch earlier in the semester, but she just talked about RA stuff the whole time, and basically just asked basic RA questions. \n\nI recently asked her to lunch again, and she said she already ate, but was going to a meditation thing at the art museum on campus. I went with her, and spent like 30 minutes just hanging in her room. It all went well, but wasn\u2019t really a date at all. I think she just wants to be friends, which is cool and all, but like why does the girl I like always either just want to be friends or ghosts me.\n\nI feel like everything is against me here, and thats why I haven\u2019t done anything all semester. Our school doesn\u2019t explicitly state that RA\u2019s can\u2019t date Residents, but I feel like its still an issue.

I was kicked to the curb on my grad night (ended up sleeping in my car with my degree at a truck-stop in Ohio). I spent most of my childhood either being beaten by my father or in foster care. Ive never had a supportive friend group, never had any foundation anywhere, and never felt loved. I mean literally never. I havent spoken to my mother in several years. I attempted to kill myself in my dorm 1.5 years ago. Shit has been bearable since then, but im starting to get bad again. Idk what to do.

Usually just ignore the feeling and tell myself im being emotional. or i just drink until im happy. but lately, the feeling of loneliness has been growing. It's becoming too much. It's overwhelming now. And i can never tell anyone. I wont let myself. I think the problem is that i dont think ive ever had a real connection with anyone. someone i can just be myself around and let my guard down. Someone i can really relate to. I have insatiable urges. an itch i can never scratch. and i cant talk about it to anyone. At least when i was younger, i could run away and spend all my money on music festivals and drugs. be reckless and irresponsible. but thats over now. I have a family. I dont think i was ever meant to be a father. i dont like children, really. I just hate that im never going to do what i want. not really. even when the kid grows up, ill still never be free again. i think that might be why the feeling of lonliness is being amplified now. its just another topic i cant talk about with anyone.

{"post_id": "dx318b", "created_utc": 1573883762, "title": "My life story?", "author": "amistupidhelpme", "self_text": "I don't know how to even start this, so I will give some tl:dr then go into detail.\n\nI have no real friends, I hate my family as no one respects, and I don't understand how emotionless I become at times.\n\nI am currently a college freshman, and throughout the years, I have honestly not found a single person I can trust with my secrets, not even my family. Although I do have some \"friends\", I view all these friendships as fake and just for benefits. I am also social awkward af, but I do believe that I treat anyone I meet with respect. I feel like people think I am unapproachable and I can't change it. So my social life is a complete 0.\n\nMy family... well, that's a whole other story on a entirely different level. I really wouldn't care much about my social issues if it wasn't for this, which elevates it 20 times more. Basically, I am the youngest of 3 boys, and ever since i could remember, I have always been bullied, disrespected, looked down up, ignored, etc... by my family. It's just insane. When my brothers bully me, my parents would always excuse is as \"playing\" with me and having fun, no matter what I told them they would just trust in my brothers and believe I am overthinking it(more to this later on). At times, I'd ask my parents for permission to do something, for instance, play video games(with my brothers, ironically),(on the weekend), and I would be refused, my brother would go then to ask, literally 60seconds after me, and my parents allow them. This may seem like a really stupid example, but it kept happening over and over again.\nAlso, my opinion for anything is always ignored. If I decide to do something, but my parents tell me otherwise, and I dont listen, and I fail, they blame me. BUT, EVEN IF I FREAKEN LISTEN TO THEM, and fail, THEY STILL FREAKEN BLAME ME. My brothers always get treated better and I am constantly treated like trash and has to listen to ever single order.\nAnother thing, my parents ALWAYS compare me to my brothers, which is expected, the worst part is, when I do something good, and compare myself to them, I would be blasted about how I shouldnt compare myself to them and I dont know what they have gone through.\nAnother thing, I am commuting to college, by my parents decision, and even with that my mom puts in the absolute most minimum freaken effort she can to cook, so 99% of the time I cook for myself. I wouldn't be irritated if she didn't cook fresh meals every weekend when my brothers are around. (Both my brothers now dorm at college). It irritates me even more that when I think about how when my brother used to commute similarly, my mom cooked for him EVERY. SINGLE. DAY. And it pisses me off every day. It doesn't end there, even when she cooks for me, I have never gotten home and ever found the food to be hot. I had to heat it every single time. this seems stupid, but coming back after 12 hours out of home I would love if my parents did something to make me feel at home, but they never do. I always spend my time in my room doing whatever, I avoid sitting down with my family because THEY MAKE FUN OF ME EVERY DAMN TIME, REGARDLESS. I also have to mention that my parents create these weird f,'ed up problems from the smallest things, and then pin it in me, making me feel even more alienated. They do whatever they can just to make fun of me and they always just brush it off when they are wrong.\n\nTo further add to that, I personally believe I am mentally stable as I am always calm and never show my anger/emotions, ever. I believe I have anxiety as my heart rate sky rockets whenever someone calls for me without tell me why before hand, I always think I'm going to get into trouble knowing full well I did nothing wrong, but my heart still races. \n\nTL:DR : no social life, hate my family\nNo one, not even my family, understand what I am going through or my emotions\n\nthank you if you read this through, I know I'm a stupid whining teenager , but thank you for reading, I wanted to take this off my chest", "subreddit": "lonely"}

I am a gay boy who needs a mate. For the past 8 years I have cried reclusively, and have become more than broken, I have become fractured as my 20's burn away crying &amp;amp; surviving. Without sharing my life with him, I am living a life or romantic deprivation. This chapter of my life needs to end. \n \nUsing a combination of dating sites, forums, events, and both online and offline communication, I haven't fallen in love no matter how friendly and affectionate I was. \n\nI have been deprived of so much due to not having a SO. I have dropped out of college, I have disassociated from organizations, I have been terminated from jobs. I have been deprived of countless simple pleasures being just one boy of two. I have been deprived of normal human activities and a career path. Due to a series of circumstances and bad directions my true self is now buried under a overburden of despair and despondency. \n\nI am done with platonic relationships, and have given up on the insanity that love will just happen when I least expect it, or that one of my plattonic gay friend will blossom into a boyfriend. Crying for romance has become a daily affirmation. My friends know full well that I cry for love and I need love. \n\nThere is nothing to live for if I'm not monogamously coupled. You will not change my mind on this. I am dead set on being a SO to another male. Denying this is existential fraud, and a violation of my true essence. \n\nI have cried enough. Each Christmas, I yearn to make out with him under the mistletoe, and each Christmas I have been deprived of this and countless other simple pleasures. \n\nLast Call. If I don't consider myself monogamously coupled by December 24th, 2019, I am going to truncate my life.  I will disappear into the night to end this deprived, miserable experience. Eight years of searching for a boyfriend and false starts, flings &amp;amp; dates will culminate in a dead body, an idea, and the worst Xmas present imaginable - if I am not monogamously coupled by Christmas Day 2019. \n\nWhere is the minority who know what they have before it's gone? Where are the gay males also crying for love? \n\nMost importantly, are you going to help my cause?\n\nUpdate November 18th, 2019: \n\nHaving no mate to look forward to after a hard day at work / school, and being deprived of the love other people are sharing all around me doesn\u2019t affect? \n\nI have lost friends because I hit on them, I have lost the will to improve myself without a mate (ive frozen personal growth because years of outward improvement has not closed the deal). \n\nYou are only seeing the snapshot of me today after these 8 years of deprived loneliness. I can assure you that you would feel very similar after 8 years of deprivation. \n\nYou can see my other posts on reddit see that internet preservation is #2, that is the only other thing worth doing. Love is #1. \n\nI was courted by a Sex and Love Addicts Anoumous Group, how can I be addicted to something I\u2019ve never had? \n\nI know what incel behavior is, I have done my best to run away from that up until now. I am not looking for benefits, a sugar daddy, I want his body and mind. I will live with him under the bridge or in a homeless encampment. I need his embrace. I need this bitcrushing to end. \n\nAlso, I tell myself everyday \u201cI deserve him\u201d, \u201cI am a beautiful, extremely intelligent guy that deserves another beautiful, extremely intelligent guy\u201d. \n\nLike an extremely desperate employer who hire anyone who meets the bare minimums (trucking industry), I\u2019ve become the same way, I\u2019ll take anyone to start and then upon finding a more compatible &amp; loving guy, Fire the lesser. \n\nI look at people making a difference in the world, and think \u201cthey have love\u201d. \n\nWhat else do I have to lose for not having his love? 10 MORE YOUNG YEARS? My Digital Life &amp; Legacy? My legs? Do I have to be gangraped, beaten and crippled before love? \n\nNeed a litmus test? If the UN signed a pact that prohibited me to have a love, I would still fall in love with him. The desire for his love is so strong that I will go against global superpowers. Liberty or Death? How about Love or Death!! \n\nI keep my word. December 24th will be my last day alive without him, so I don\u2019t have to endure another Christmas of deprivation. I have 3 PAINLESS ways to terminate myself, as I have had enough pain. If you are going to help me close the deal you have until December 20th to do it.\n\nLet\u2019s get my story on the News.

Basically, whenever I'm about to start a train of thoughts, I ask myself if it's rational, and if the thought-process would benefit me. I'm so ugly that I'd never have an SO, so thoughts about love should be culled early on. I pulled over an all-nighter &amp; this technique helped me for 6 hours, so I'm not sure if it'd work in the long run, but it's made me question the unnecessary time spent on Reddit - I had been seeking support, in a way, but spent too much time &amp; only got more frustrated. I'm being realistic now because seeking support isn't worth it for me. I need love, not support, but I'll never find love, so any endeavor in either directions would only waste my time. I'm not sure but I think this strategy is somewhat like [Reinforcement Learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reinforcement_learning) in Machine Learning parlance; I've tried various approaches &amp; false hope always lets me down, so I'll actively evaluate where I should focus my energy. Maybe I'll still come to the conclusion that I'd be better off dead, but I've to pay off a huge debt to a family member, so I'd not be killing myself in the next 2-3 years anyway.\n\nFatalism in my case is justified because I'm incurably facially-disfigured, so I don't recommend each &amp; every one of you to follow the same strategy. Maybe ugly people won't have to worry about love when we'll reach Singularity.\n\nI wish you all good luck. \n\nGoodbye", "subreddit": "ForeverAlone"}

{"post_id": "dx9155", "created_utc": 1573921873, "title": "I (24 M) am constantly being ignored by a particular female friend (24 F) among my friend circle.", "author": "[deleted]", "self_text": "  \n\nI\u2019m a guy living in India, currently training for competitive exams (and some other stuff). I consider myself decent looking; neither exactly handsome nor ugly, just average. I have never been in a relationship before, and I don\u2019t mind being in a relationship but I\u2019m not actively looking for a girlfriend. I was never a good conversation starter but I can make people laugh frequently, and I never tried to hit on anyone because I didn\u2019t want relationships to hinder my grades in university. Girls usually drop subtle hints at me but I ignore them because I am dumb and realize hints later.\n\nI have a pretty small group of friends, but only 1 close friend (male buddy) and among my friends, there\u2019s a girl who is also single and never had a relationship before. A brief introduction of her; she\u2019s pretty, but not too much, smart, maybe extrovert, great conversationalist, bonds with people very well, caring and all that. Many of my colleagues and classmates often talk to her, and she talks back pretty normally, some frequently hit on her but she rarely flirts back. Although I know many guys who actively have a crush on her and I think she\u2019s unaware of them. As of now according to my knowledge, she\u2019s isn\u2019t seeing anyone either. Let\u2019s call her Natasha.\n\nSo we\u2019ve been studying together through our Bachelors and Masters, but she\u2019s in my friend circle since the Masters (last 2 years). My close buddy is a very good friend of her because he\u2019s in relationship with her friend. I used to make everyone laugh when we were hanging out or having lunch, etc. Everyone talked freely to me but my close friend (let\u2019s call him Karan) was the more preferred one; meaning, if someone in my group has to start a conversation or ask a question, they would look and speak to Karan first. On the attractive scale Karan and I would rank pretty much the same except, he\u2019s more charismatic. And btw, most of the friends in my group are female (except me and Karan).\n\nSo Natasha, rarely starts a conversation with me, and the conversations are usually short and brief and sometimes we would laugh over a joke. Even if I started a conversation, she would terminate it after a short time. When we would part ways after a hangout she would wave bye to everyone except me, or unless I waved first at her. She doesn\u2019t like me romantically except for that one time when she dropped every possible hint at me in one day. I replied well to those hints and we connected well, but the next day she didn\u2019t look at me when we met, instead she talked to and joked around my friend Karan, and unless I spoke to her, she didn\u2019t look at me. Even if we talked in a group, she would always turn towards Karan after looking at me for a brief second. This, didn\u2019t happened once, but numerous times, everyone treated me the same except her. She will always speak or ask Karan first about anything, even though Karan and I spend most of our time together throughout the day because we go to classes together.\n\nI\u2019ve never tried to hit on her, I like her as a friend but it only occurred to me once that maybe I could be in a relationship with her. So once I tried to talk to her frequently but she didn\u2019t seem interested so I backed off; only I would start the conversation. I did not hit on her since then. \n\nSkipping to today, it\u2019s her birthday, and I was invited too but I didn\u2019t wanna go because I did not want to be ignored again. But I had to go since she treats me as her friend and I had no legit excuse. I tried to play it cool and treat her the same as everyone and talk to her but, damn, nothing changed, and I was being ignored and overshadowed by Karan. Now, the thing is, if she hates me, why would she invite me. Or if she just treats me as a friend, why doesn\u2019t she talk to me normally. Also, if there is something off and/or weird about me, why don\u2019t my other female friends treat me the same as Natasha. It throws me off every time. Does she have a crush on Karan? Or does she dislikes me in particular. Or, she\u2019s afraid that I might sway her into having a relationship with me. I don\u2019t like the way she treats me and its bothering me to my core.", "subreddit": "lonely"}

{"post_id": "dxateh", "created_utc": 1573930076, "title": "The only one without a roommate", "author": "au_gold3872", "self_text": "I remembered when I was in 8th grade, we were going on an end of year trip to Canada. And everyone was finding their roommates and stuff, and I thought I was going to find a roommate but I unfortunately I didn't. Earlier, I made an agreement to be roommates with someone but they ended going with someone else. I also asked a friend if they wanted to be my roommate, because we were roommates in a different trip back in 6th grade. She already had someone to be with. I was sad that people didn't think of me, and that I was just being left out, which I now kind of realize that its kind of selfish to think of because the world doesn't revolve around me. Something that I didn't realize in the past.\n\nA week before the trip, we had a meeting to go over the rules and procedures, and what we were going to do. Our teacher told us to stand next to our roommate and I remember being the only person sitting down. It felt really embarrassing. People were looking at me, someone told me to stand up and just stand next to someone, but I didn't want to do that, it would feel awkward. It really hurt cause I felt like I didn't exist to people. I had friends in school but I thought I existed to them. But I didn't know I was going to be left out like this. When everyone left the room, I told the teacher that I didn't have a roommate and he told me that he would set me up with someone on the attendance sheet. It really hurt that I couldn't find my own roommate. When I got home, I called my mom and cried to her and I told her that I didn't want to go on this trip anymore. I told her that I didn't have anyone, and that I was all by myself. My mom convinced me to go and I ended up going. I was really scared, and I didn't want to go at all. I just wanted to stay home. I cried cause I'm a sensitive, I get upset easily.\n\nWe were going to this college in Canada to stay in for 3 nights I think. The first day we got there, our teacher was calling out the names on the attendance sheet for the roommates. He called this girl's name and it was followed by my name being called next to her's. Turns out she didn't have a roommate either. She didn't show up to the last trip meeting. To be honest, I felt huge weight lift off my shoulders. I knew the girl, and she's very nice to me. I was not that close with her, but it felt good to finally have a roommate.\n\nAlthough this story ended on a good note, I sometimes still struggle with the same problem of feeling like I don't exist to people. The same thing still happens where people will go to other's first, and I'm like the \"leftover person.\" I'm really trying my best to not let this bother me because I have to deal with this almost every day.", "subreddit": "lonely"}

We all deserve to make a connection, feel needed, feel wanted, feel friendship, and feel loved.  No matter what someone has said to you, yelled at you, beat into you, ingrained in you! YOU DESERVE ATTENTION, TALKING, FRIENDSHIP, AND LOVE.   How do you get it?  I know it is very, very, hard, and scary, but you have to come out of your comfort zone. Message someone. go out and strike up a conversation at a library about a book, if you have something creative you can do, go to that, basketball, tennis, drawing... go to a class, a basketball game, a poetry reading. Even an AA meeting. All are welcome. Strike up a conversation. I have been coming out of my comfort zone. It is so very hard, but not all people are mean. Each time you have a good convo, you feel better.  I know you want face to face contact like i was told, but you have to start with finding someone first. Friendship, trust, respect, you have to build relationships, then eventually if you are looking for a partner that naturally comes next if you both like each other.  Don't give up. Do not take your life.   START HERE. BE CAREFUL. BE SAFE.   \\*\\*\\*\\* WHERE IS EVERYONE FROM? \\*\\*\\*  I am in Arkansas in the US. IF everyone posts where they are from you can start with your same state, or same province, online talking, then progress to video talking then eventually meeting!!!!  with 86,000 lonely hearts here, there has to be some friendships that can be found!

I'm afraid to talk about how I feel in fear of retaliation.. I got to know this girl I work with. Just friends, but I really like her. As usual, I was bad at hiding it. She found out, or she knew the whole time, one or the other. She told me all we'll be is friends never anything more. And said \"please stop\". And it broke my fucking heart. For a number of reasons, it hurt. It hurt because I put myself into another painful situation despite knowing she'd never like me back. It hurt when I read \"please stop\" because clearly I made her uncomfortable and upset... I never wanted to do that. All I ever wanted was to make her happier. I just wanted to help but all I ever did was make things worse. It broke my heart because believe it or not, she saved my life. I was slipping. My suicidal thoughts were occurring on an every day basis, I was losing my strength to go to work, I had just lost the motivation to do anything. I wanted to leave... She gave me hope. I never stood a chance, but the thought of \"maybe\" kept me going. Talking to her was literally a reason for me to wake up.. But I scared her away.... The only time she ever talks to me now is if she needs weed. I know what you're thinking, but no. It isn't like that. It's my fault... It's all my fault. I want to apologize to her so bad.. She said we're still friends, but I fear that isn't true.. I'm terrified that I did too much damage. I'm terrified that I made things too awkward again. I'm tired of scaring people away, man... I'm tired of feeling useless, expendable, hopeless.. Just once, I wish somebody could like me back. I wish I was worth liking back.. I wish I could be important to someone... I know she doesn't like me that way. And as much as it hurts, I know she never will. She was way out of my league anyway. But I wish that we could go back to being friends. I wish she didn't feel uncomfortable talking to me. I wish I didn't have to spend literally every day in agony because of my pent up feelings and guilt. My guilt for making her feel uncomfortable and hurting her feelings is consuming me. It hurts knowing that I fucked everything up. I don't know what hurts worse, the fact that she won't talk to me anymore, or the fact that I don't blame her at all.... If I were her, I'd have left me in the dust too.. I wish I wasn't stuck here, on this planet. I'm afraid to talk about how I feel now. Because if anything points towards me liking her, it'll make things even worse. And I am barely holding on as it is. I don't want to slip worse... I've accepted that she'll never like me back. But that doesn't mean I can afford to lose her. During the few months that we talked, I saw a friend that I could relate to with more than anyone. A lot of things in life can be replaced. But you can't replace good friendship. Unfortunately for me, you can fuck it up. And that's exactly what I did.... I'll never get over that.. Every day I'm in pain. Every. Day. I never thought something would hurt worse than suicidal depression. But I was wrong. What hurts the most is feeling worthless to the one person you want to be seen by more than anyone. I've never hurt so much in my life. At least with suicidal depression it doesn't hurt other people. Just me. But no, my worthless ass had to go and like someone who I KNEW, I fucking KNEW would never like me. And I ruined everything I should've saved myself the heartache and never even talked to her. She'd without a doubt be happier too... I don't have the courage to kill myself. But every chance I get, I wish that something bad would happen to me. Something out of my control. Something that kills me, without it being my fault.. Let me go. I'm tired..", "subreddit": "ForeverAlone"}

I\u2019ve been depressed for as long as I can remember myself but this year was going perfect, found a good paying job, reconnected with a friend I really loved, ended up in a relationship with her. Finally, I was feeling good. The thing is, she has multiple sclerosis and also she had some problems with her ex, he treated her badly, made her feel insignificant, he was telling her that nobody was ever going to love her cause of her condition and shit like that to the point she wasn\u2019t ready to commit with me. It\u2019s acceptable though I don\u2019t find that preposterous. Well she asked me to break up but to be honest, I\u2019ve been in love with her for a really long time. 4 years to be exact so I wasn\u2019t ready to let it end. I skipped going to work just to try to salvage this relationship. I was successful at that point, but I got fired. It was ok, if I could pull finding a job like that once I could do it again, or so I thought. After that my father attempted suicide and I didn\u2019t know what to do, we never had a good relationship so tbh I didn\u2019t really care. I took my sister in since she is a minor and our mother died 12 years ago, and I found another job, this time at a bar, temporarily so I could pay some bills and provide what I could for my sister. Some days passed and my girlfriend didn\u2019t feel ok, I was treating her with utmost respect, giving her as much space as she needed, meeting her whenever she was available. I tried my best to not push her to do anything. We had plans one day to go to a concert together but she went and booked a ticket for another one at the same day, well I got mad but I think it\u2019s understandable. We had a fight that day and we broke up, this time for good. After a couple of days we decided to keep a friendly relationship but we all know how hard it is to stay friends with someone you love. In the end we stopped talking, I made a bunch of mistakes back to back and ended up losing this job as well, I\u2019m not gonna say that it was stress and/or depression that pushed me to failure cause I don\u2019t like making excuses, it\u2019s cause I\u2019m bad at managing my life. The thing is, I\u2019m not the most likeable person since I\u2019ve been fighting a constant back to back war against depression, I ended up pushing most of my friends away. Nobody really wants to talk to me anymore. As my father got better my sister moved back with him cause I couldn\u2019t support her financially. I was feeling so alone and attempted suicide, but before I did that I made sure to tell it to my ex, part of me thought that she would try to talk me out of it, she didn\u2019t see the message in time. For good or worst the attempt failed, and I\u2019m still here. It\u2019s my third attempt to date, first was when my mother died and second was like 2 years ago. I don\u2019t feel like I want to die right now but I\u2019m feeling so alone. I\u2019ve tried to make up with my friends but nobody is willing to forgive me, I tried talking to my ex again and she wants nothing to do with me.

But I don\u2019t want to be your stereotypical neck beard (though I can\u2019t grow any facial hair lol) who\u2019s a permavirgin.\nI\u2019m honestly pretty ugly. Ive got a huge acne problem and no matter what I try it doesn\u2019t go away. I don\u2019t have a car because I don\u2019t want to pay for one. I\u2019ve got nothing. And I guess I deserve to be alone because of that.\nI got rejected the other day. My roommate was certain it\u2019d work out and was sad it didn\u2019t. He invited me to hang out with him and his girlfriend, but they just talked to each other the whole time and I was left to sit there awkwardly. I know they meant well, but it\u2019s just so embarrassing to be so alone.\nThe good news is that I\u2019m suicidal, so I could have a way out. But I\u2019ve been suicidal since I was 7 and have always been too weak to kill myself, so chances are I won\u2019t be able to now.", "subreddit": "lonely"}

I may be 36, but I don't feel like I experienced any growth beyond college.  While all my friends got married and had kids after college, I stayed the same.  I quit using Facebook, because I got tired of seeing all the happiness and kid pictures everywhere.  Maybe that makes me a bitter man.  Social Media is all about presenting a glorified picture of yourself for bragging rights.  It is a rat race of comparison.  I refuse to participate in that anymore.  I do like reddit though.  I like reading people's personal experiences.    \n\nI still stay up until 2 AM on Friday nights, sometimes later.  There is no one to answer to or to wake up for.  If I want to order a pizza at 10 PM, I can do that.  If I go to the bar, no one tells me off.  I guess the days of doing homework and cramming for tests are over though.  I can sleep in on Saturday and Sunday if I want.  If I don't cook in time, I can just go to a restaurant.  Of course, the irony of this is I would trade all these things for the responsibility of having a wife and kids.\n\nIs having responsibility what sets apart an adult from a youth?  \n\nSure, I go to my job, pay my bills and taxes, but what is it all for? I don't own my own place.  Thanks to the crappy economy in the 2010's, I was unemployed for a while so I am financially behind like many Millennials are.

I live in a city now (not that small, but definitely not big) for university but I've grown up in the same state my whole life. When you've grown up in the same area for 19 years and you don't have a single friend from there, and now you've lived in a city for the past two years while going to university and you still have no real friends, you (unsurprisingly) start to feel like you don't belong here. \n\nRight now it's quite a long shot, but there's an opportunity that came up at work that would involve transferring to a bigger city, most likely New York. And I won't lie, just the mere thought of moving there and starting over brought me a feeling of happiness (even though it was small) that I haven't felt in over a year. I no longer have a purpose where I am, or at least it feels like it. The first thing I'm always told is to focus on finishing school first, but right now I just have no desire or motivation whatsoever. I used to be an excellent student, but now I'm just drifting through this semester. I'm at a point where my goal is no longer to succeed in my classes, but to do the bare minimum to avoid failing. I know I'm better than this and I know I'm capable of succeeding academically, just not right now. I feel like I'm just wasting my educational experience if I decide to keep going while being completely devoid of interest. It's been like this for quite a while now and there is no sign of things getting better. \n\nSo why the hell shouldn't I move? People want to go on about the risks and the what-ifs about making such a big change, and while some of these concerns are valid, I feel like many of them are not really applicable in my case. Things are pretty much currently at their lowest. Even if I do move and it's a struggle, I would not be any worse off than I am right now. I have nothing to lose at this point by at least trying. And I might as well do it sooner while I'm still young rather than later. \n\nI get it, while huge places like New York provide many more opportunities to establish social connections, you could make the argument that it won't help me. Moving won't change the person I am. I would still be bringing all of my anxieties and insecurities that I have now. What makes me think that simply moving to a much bigger and more populous location would help me fare any better on a social level when my personality seems to be the sole problem? \n\nAnd my answer to that would be, I don't know. I do know the first time I moved away from home proved to be a positive experience for me, so it's not weird to think that it would help me now. Of course, right now this is all speculation. But like I said, just the thought of doing this is able to make me feel slightly happy and warm inside when nothing else can, so I'll hang on to the idea for as long as I can to help me move forward.", "subreddit": "ForeverAlone"}

I can talk to people fine and can sometimes kind of flirt but as soon as it escalates from friendly chit chat to actual discussions of relationship I get huge anxiety and wimp out straight away. I want a girlfriend but every chance I get I suddenly get huge anxiety and start to kind of shut down. I mean a couple months ago, a friend sent me a screenshot of a girl (I secretly liked at the time) saying she liked me. I obviously was happy but was also getting anxiety and generally considering not saying anything to her at school about it. The whole message turned out to be a prank by my friends which wasn\u2019t too great as well. I know I\u2019m only 16 but my friends are all getting girlfriends and losing their virginities and I haven\u2019t even held a girls hand.

I\u2019m happy for my friends when they get girlfriends or lose their virginity (like a bro thing) but I feel like I\u2019m lagging way behind. I think my biggest problems are I care too much about what others would think of my relationship (I\u2019m very self conscious) and I\u2019m very frigid and shy meaning if a girl was to ask me out I\u2019d probably just shut down.

The thing going for me is that I have a huge number of genuinely interesting hobbies. I am also physically fit, above average height, very clean and not that bad looking. Even with these, I am totally socially inept. Strangely enough, I have had a kind of epiphany. I feel like I am finally mostly at peace with my situation. I get so much satisfaction from my interests that maybe a relationship is not necessary. I might also be dodging a bullet with all of the insane women out there today. The thing that gets me is when I see a woman I genuinely feel love for, not lust, and I remember that old feeling of depression.", "subreddit": "ForeverAlone"}

He looked at me like I had just cursed in church and told me \"that's not true, look at your handsome face, you just don't pay attention or write it off whenever a woman shows interest in you\". To which I responded with the fact that I know what it looks like when a woman is interested, because I've seen it happen with friends and colleagues. It simply doesn't happen to me. He then told me that I'm allowed to show interest as well, and continued eating with a distraught look.\n\nI've never told him about me being FA but now that I'm 24 I think it's only fair to be honest with my parents, even if it devastates them. I wish people would just accept the fact that there isn't someone for everyone and that it isn't always our own fault.

Before we lived in a nice modest apartment with my 2 loving cats near my family but not his. Because he was in college/working and I was just working 40 hours a week we managed to get by, I felt like I could contribute half equally. He's in debt about 150k and didn't finish his degree despite being only 3 classes away, so we had to start making over 1k loan payments a month. (We're in the USA btw, and I feel like his loan payments are alot but not as bad as some people) Because we had to make montly payments so large, even with us both working full time (me 40 hrs, him over 60hrs) we couldn't manage to make rent AND his payments so we had to move in with his mother. I was fine with this only because he begged and convinced me this situation would only last 2 yrs max. Before we moved I begged him to either finish school or take my uncles offer for a very nice job he could hook him up with that could allow us to afford his payments AND our rent easily but he refused. I'm not sure if he was scared because it was in the field of his degree and he felt ill equipped or what. So we move, I have to uproot my entire life to be with him somewhere I've only visited a few times, get a new job and have no friends. I struggle heavily with depression and suicidal tendencies so for about 6 months - 1 yr I withdrew, our relationship deteriorated. Just recently I started opening up to him, being more affectionate and explaining how I felt. Today I told him I felt trapped financially and emotionally because he confided in me it would no longer take 2 yrs but 5. He exploded at me, calling me a moocher and saying it's just as equally my fault because I'm still finishing college and working full time but not contributing enough money for us to move out sooner. I feel alone, I have no one to vent too and he keeps pushing me to be friendly with his family even though he knows I suffer from depression and social anxiety. I know he does it out of a place of love, and I know it's good for me and I appreciate him and everything he does and has done for me and for us. I just wish he would at least try to understand, I know hes upset and wants to move out too but there are so many times when this topic comes up it really feels like hes content to live here forever. I'm 25 yrs old right now, I don't wanna still be living here by the time I'm 30. I understand it's on me too to help speed up my college so I can land a degree and a better paying job, we're both stressed out and I love him and I wanna marry him and spend my life with him but sometimes I just wish our situation could've been different. \n\nI'm sorry I'm not even sure this goes in here but I feel alone, have no where to vent but here.

I have a real friend from college who only hangs out with me on few weekends (mainly when he wants me do homework with him) and I have my real friend from high school who I just don't feel like going out with sometimes, because he can be kind of boring. I have a friend from the opposite side of my metro area who is a friend with benefit I met off of Scruff (I'm bi) and I barely see him, since he lives far + heavy traffic.\n\nI spend my weekends alone, which I actually do enjoy, but screw our society. I've eaten at restaurants alone since April 2019 and yeah it's not bad once you \"practice\" get used to it, but I dine alone at places I am comfortable at. I only eat alone at diners mainly since they have plenty of not busy counter seating and since eating alone there is normal whether if you are old or not. I eat at Indian buffets alone on Wednesdays before school. Yesterday, I did not want to eat at a diner, so I had SO MUCH trouble finding a sit-down restaurant I could eat alone in without being stared at.\n\nIt absolutely sucks that society thinks that eating MUST be a social thing (not sure if it's an American thing). EVERY restaurant is filled with people who have friends or SOs (not counting the families, considering the fact that I do not want kids) and I bet the people who eat solo and drink beer solo at the bars in chain restaurants like Applebees or Buffalo Wild Wings end up looking like they are not alone, because they probably easily can talk to people next to them, while I am shy and I also hate watching sports. I am not a beer drinker, I am more a eater and I would drink different alcohol types. I am too embarrassed to sit at a crowded bar. That's why I like diners. Yesterday, I was driving my car suspiciously around different mom n pop restaurants and stared through the windows to see how crowded and awkward the privacy was in the place and I kept driving away until I ended up going to a surprisingly uncrowded Smashburger. I had two double mushroom truffle swiss cheese burger and small Smashburger fries. I WASTED a full freakin' hour trying to look for a place to eat, because of my fear of sitting in a crowded bar as a person eating alone.

{"post_id": "dy4nm2", "created_utc": 1574091027, "title": "19yo lonely", "author": "Radiation16_", "self_text": "Hello! I'm Rads (Arisu is cool too), I'll use my username for reasons i'll explain below.\n\nSo yeah, I'm 19 years old, spanish. I'm studying programming but i've loved computers since i was 3 (my dad used to have a computer store before i was even born, I grew up with a computer and lots of hardware at home). I do also like to read manga, way more than anime since I feel anime is really slow paced when compared to a comic, my favourite one being One Piece. Also I like electronic and techno music (plus subgenres) altho I'm not just locked to those genres.\n\nI do like gaming too, but i tend to enjoy infinitely more a singleplayer experience than playing with friends, I just like to be on my own at my pace.\n\n**That's the basics covered, let's get to the advanced half of this.**\n\nSince began school, I've always been bullied, making a huge sink in my self-steem and confidence, it got worse when i entered high school, because I got more bullied and depression started. Spent my highschool years normally, even tho I was mildly depressed, and then, the last two years happened. My last two hs years were hell, i wasn't bullied, and i got relatively good at social, my classmates were really cool, and I have to thank them for opening me. That said, the exams along with my parents expectations and my fear of them, really made my depression worse, and it made me a huge dick. Don't get me wrong, I wasn't a dick for the sake of being a dick, I just was too clingy, too desperate and played with people's feelings, all of this happened whenever I had crysis. So I was literally pushing them away, my depression made me do that, and I lost a lot of wonderful people because of it, not blaming depression per se, it was my fault after all, I was the one doing those actions.\n\nThat said, there was another key piece in that depression, **my gender**.\n\nIn 2017 I started feeling like a girl (I was born male) and those feelings started to grow on me, after a few months of pain I told my parents and they weren't that supportive at first. Which made things EVEN worse. In late 2017 I told my parents I was depressed, they were really worried and I started going to a psychologist\n\nStuff started to change next year, during my last year of hs, during the second trimester, I missed some classes, by the third one, I missed every single period I had. My marks weren't good by any means. I was also too negative and things looked really dark in my eyes. On the last week, I decided to finally quit school. For a bit of context, you should know I live in a really small village, based on agriculture, like all my zone. When I prompted my parents with the fact I wanted to quit high school because I wasn't feeling good there, they hooked me up as a farmer pawn, which was... okay. Obviously not my desired job but a job nontheless. I worked at my aunt's store as a restocker too.\n\nI spent some time working, and the work at the farm was really aggravating me, in June 26 2018 exactly, I attempted suicide and failed (Thanks god I failed). I got to a psychiatrist after that, a really good one, I might say. I started to get medication, and spend the rest of the summer okay, with some irl friends, but they actually made fun of my because attempting suicide, that wasn't making me feeling better. As a normal person should do, I got rid of that kind people with time. This summer was also when I pushed away REALLY hard all my online friends, and really hurt them. They were the only people I had real trust with, people I had a fulfilling relationship with, unlike my irl friends. So I ended up, alone, while I used to spend hours on discord talking with friends daily, after the point I blocked them all and deleted during a lot of my crises , I spent aprox almost a year without using it. By September 2018, I was feeling a little bit better, and got a new job, I'd be learning as an electrician, specialiced in solar power. During this year of contract, I started feeling progresively better, and I was really enjoying my job.\n\nAt some point during early 2019 I noticed that I was feeling okay again. Future wasn't so dark anymore, bad things could happen, but they happen to everyone, I could get out of anything, I was feeling powered again. All of this boosted my self-respect and confidence. I was a really happy for the first time in ages.\n\nAbout my gender, I learnt to accept myself as I am, as my body is. I still felt female on my soul, but my body was the one of a boy. In summer 2018, I could just see HRT far far away, but now, I don't believe I need it at all now. I don't know what my gender is, or how to classify my feelings of \"I'm a girl, my body is male, but I just get along with it and live happy with this body anyways\", so what I did was literally to not think about it. Why wasting energy in trying to assign myself a label where I can fit when after all I am who I am, I cannot do anything about it and I'm happy with it? I don't need hormones to feel better, because this is my body, and I like it.\n\nThis also creates a complex problem where I don't know how people should refer to me, but I don't really care either, I don't mind called he or she to be actually honest. IRL, everyone calls me he, because that's what is easier for everyone (including me), but yeah, I wouldn't mind she either.\n\n[Acurate representation of me](https://pics.me.me/thumb_and-what-does-he-find-some-gender-confused-wolf-yeah-screw-62425805.png)\n\nThe point is, I literally had no more depression nor huge problems by April 2019, I was happy. My psychiatrist removed my meds a couple of months later, I was set. I was ready for anything, I got the english proficency level B2, I obtained my certificate of electrician, I enrolled in driving school and more importantly, I started studying again. Thankfully, here in spain, there is an alternative to \"bachillerato\" aka the last two years of hs, which is \"formaci\u00f3n profesional\" (vocational training), and there is one exclusively about computer IT. My subjects vary from server management and computer building and maintenance to web design and programming (Which is what I want to do for a living).\n\nThe reason I'm telling you my story today, is because, even tho I'm happy now, I have nobody. I do have irl friends, and a couple of online friends. But none of my relationships are meaningful. My school friends are just in school, we don't talk outside of it, same happened at work, same happens now that I'm studying again. I can't open myself to people, let that be because I don't trust them enough, or I'm just scared of hurting anyone that is close to me. Either way, I'm just looking for someone to kill my continious feeling of loneliness. Is not something that happens from one day to another, of course not, I just want to meet new people, and do my best to be a good friend and build a nice relationship with time.\n\nThis was a lot of text, took me a couple of hours to think and write. But if you got to this point, thank you, deeply.", "subreddit": "lonely"}

Given the username, you may be able to tell that music is a massive part of my life. I play guitar, bass, a bit of piano, drums, and a few others. I've been teaching myself these instruments (starting with guitar) for over a year now. But even then, I'm not good enough to make anything of it. You can only teach yourself so much. I know chords and suck, and I know all of the keys on the piano and whatnot, but I know very little theory. A few other passions of mine are literature and video creating, and whereas I haven't really given either of those a try, given the odds I don't feel confident in pursuing them at all. Call it cliche, but I've always wanted an audience of sorts. People who enjoy the content I make, whatever it may be. Music, videos, literature, anything. But I just don't feel good enough. And I never have the time to try and improve upon my passions, nor do I even have the goddamn motivation anymore. I work part-time and go to highschool full-time. I don't know. I just feel so trapped, so alone. I've been thinking about suicide so much lately, and it's honestly scaring me. I don't want to die at a young age, but I fear it'll all just become too overwhelming and my emotions will get the better of me. When? I don't know. But I fear it'll happen. Even if I don't kill myself, I feel as though I'll only end up a lonesome loser with nothing to be proud or happy for. Life just doesn't seem worth it anymore, and I really wish it would change. I want to better myself so badly. I want to start exercising and losing weight, to try and get into the dating scene, to try and solidify myself in the music industry or the YouTube community, and to just generally better myself and my life, but I haven't the time or motivation to do any of that right now.

When you never experience warmth, affection, romance, love, you\u2019re more than likely going to be aching for it.

On the other hand, the people who push these \u2018clingers\u2019 away seem to not want to understand them or help them understand why their behavior is repelling them from others. \n\nI get it, people have their own shit to deal with, and a lot of the time they don\u2019t have the time to help someone else with their social failings or give them a chance to be connected with them so they can see the value of them as a friend or romantic partner.

When I was younger, in hs/early college, I was very social, had lots of friends .. I was always wanton for a romantic relationship, but I had no shortage of people to talk to, to keep informed and engaged in my life. This first started to dwindle once I got in my first serious relationship when I was 19, and I was head-over-heels in love. I spent every moment with that person and began neglecting my other relationships. \n\nWhen they dumped me + broke my heart, I was very lonely. Because I was afraid of judgment (we were lesbians at the time) I didn\u2019t share my feelings with my friends &amp; ended up isolating myself further. I languished in sorrowful solitude not getting to enjoy the things I should have been in my young+opportune time for a good 1.5yrs thereafter. My sorrows only ended when I met another girl who then became my world. \n\nWe dated for almost 3 years and were very in love, but things started to crumble because of how lonely I still grew to feel. This person had lots of friends, and by this point in my life I\u2019d isolated myself so far from my former social self I didn\u2019t have the same. I began to feel really sad and jealous when this person devoted their attention to others than me, and I started to feel like our relationship was doomed, and I was doomed to sadness again, because of this. \n\nThis is when \u201cFortune\u201d smiled upon me again, and before I had the chance to get my heart broken, I met another girl. We fell quickly in love and I traded this relationship for the other one since my ex was paying me no attention in comparison to this new love. We dated and were very happy for about 2 years when I started to catch the same type of feeling, of being neglected by my partner for her friends, while I didn\u2019t have any. \u201cLucky\u201d for me, the cycle repeated itself again. Met another girl, fell head over heels barely before I had broken up with my current gf. We began to date and things were bliss ....\n\nFast forward 3 years later. My ex broke up with me; for awhile, she remained my friend, but soon she cut herself out of my life as well, even though I begged her to remain friends. I didn\u2019t want our relationship to end after all; but her friendship was equally if not more important to me as the person I grew closer to than any person before; not to mention, my social connections withered and dried up to absolutely nothing in the years we were together. \n\nNow here I am with nothing and no one. While I wish I could still call many of these people my friends, they don\u2019t want to be. \n\nBy this point I feel forever consigned to being lonely, unless and until that cycle repeats itself again. I feel like a different person who doesn\u2019t recognize my former self, it feels so desperately foreign to have absolutely no one to confide in , to share my life and my days with. I do still have my father and my sister, but they are very busy with their own lives and have their own significant others to care about more than they do me. \n\nI miss having someone who cares about the goings-on in my life above anyone else\u2019s; I miss, too, being that source of care. \nHere\u2019s hoping I find that again; but here\u2019s knowing that it won\u2019t come easy, if at all.

I have no one to talk to I feel so alone. \n\nI'm very young, still in highschool actually. From the exterior most would be shocked to hear that I feel like actual living and breathing shit. I'm a quite popular female in my highschool and where I'm from. Boston is fairly small and I have a following on social media, kids my age literally recognize me on the street and it's so weird. It's like, once you're well known people don't view you as just a person you know? I'm still just another highschooler, I don't feel special or any different. In middle school I wore big bulky glasses, didn't know how to dress or style my hair, and then the summer into my freshmen year something just switched in me, all of a sudden I got my shit together. \n\nMy mom got me contacts I started dressing nicer, boxing, doing my hair, and got treated A LOT differently from my peers. All of a sudden people wanted to be my friends, boys were talking about me, it was all so new I didn't know how to handle it. \n\nI have always been a really shy kid, I had like 3 friends, loved reading, watched anime, wrote FOR FUN, all that dorky shit. But that was a while ago, it feels like forever. I miss the old me, I miss not having all this attention. I hate it, I hate it so much i want to cry. I feel like I was forced to adapt these certain sort of social skills to make it by and I still suck at it anyway. I get so nervous when people even make eye contact with me, I start to fucking sweat\n\nI still feel awkward in social settings, I get invited to parties and don't know what to fucking do or say, I can't even fucking dance and I'm latina, like what the fuck.\n\nI feel like people notice this shit too, but they just wave me off, they don't care what i have to say, I'm just some lightskin bitch that gets them free shit because guys think shes cute. I can get us free food or weed, or some cashier guy will give us a discount for my snap, or I can get the homework answers from some weird kids in class, little benefits like that. \n\nLiterally, I want girl friends, but I don't know how to interact, i actually get more nervous around girls than guys,. i don't know if it's because i want validation from fellow females because I want a female friendship so badly or because I'm attracted to them. I think I might be bi, but my families so homophobic and I never really cared to think about the possibility because I am still attracted to guys very much. The girls I hang out with now are funny and I like them, but I can feel how I put on this whole fake persona for them as well, I hate it. \n\nBut I feel so empty, I feel like I'm not me. \n\nNow I smoke weed like everyday. I recently got caught by my parents for smoking and they made me quit my job. i worked at a art studio it was the only thing I liked to do. Now they will be picking me up from school [every.fucking.day](https://every.fucking.day) \n\nI hate being in that fucking house. My dad is a recovered drug addict and thinks hes almighty just because of it, like I dont remember how he basically stole my childhood from me, and my mom is just psychotic. she's a control freak. She literally has cameras INSIDE of our house. Monitors all my text messages like I'm 12, takes all my money from work and puts it who knows where. Not only that but she doesn't believe in mental illnesses. \n\nMy family has a big ass pattern of drug abuse and mental illness. My uncle is in a mental hospital and has schizophrenia, my dad has chronic depression and anxiety (which I was oh so lucky to inherit), and I KNOW my mom needs some sort of fucking help. \n\nMy mom has always been so perfect her brothers were big crackheads and watching them grow up made her hate people like them, funny how she married one though. But yeah, and she works at a hospital and hears sob stories all the time so she's sort of heartless when I try to open up to her and tell her why I smoke and shit. \n\nWell actually I don't open up to anyone. I dont know why i feel this way. I used to get good grades, be social, be a kid. I don't care about anything anymore. I dont give a fuck about school, when I cant smoke I sleep. I think I sleep because it's the closest thing to death. I'm happiest when I can't think about anything, that's why i like smoking and sleeping.\n\nI don't know why but I just hate myself. i recently tried to see if maybe getting a boyfriend would help, I'm talking to this guy but he's a big catch and I'm pretty sure he's a little too friendly with other girls so I'm not taking it very serious, I don't care very much. But he's really sweet and seems very into me, it maybe just my trust issues and paranoia, most of my friends get cheated on.\n\nI've never opened up to anyone, not even my best friend, my parents, never been super close to someone like that, never had a boyfriend none of that.\n\nThe thing is how would I even explain myself, sure I've been through some shit but my parents always tell me my life isn't that bad to feeling and acting this way. My parents are so controlling, it has it's ups and downs. I am always being tracked down by my mom from my phone, where I am from FindMyiPhone, if they don't like a friend of mines I must stop hanging out with them, my mom will do little shit like block them, make me go home super early so I can't hang out with anyone until the person eventually leaves me. And she won't even get to know the person she judges everyone by how they look. But I am very spoiled, i don't have chores and I never cook, my dads a chef so he literally just asks when I'm hungry and cooks for me. But I always have to be stuck in that fucking house with my toxic ass mother. They make me go straight home from school everyday and I get out at 1:45 pm, basically when the day is just starting, just to sit in my room and do nothing but sleep or watch tv. I hate it. And now I don't even have a job to go to so I have literally nothing to do.\n\nI used to feel sad but now I don't even care anymore, I don't care if I get in trouble for smoking again, fuck I'm about to get another cart for my waxpen tomorrow. I feel this emptiness I don't know what it is.\n\nI wouldn't even know how to open up to someone, because I don't know whats wrong. All this shit going on inside my head for no reason, all I have is a mom who's annoying and toxic sometimes and a dumb ass ex-thug dad, the hard times are over for the most part even though he disappears every like 2 months and relapses then comes back and every things back to normal.\n\nMost of my family comes from the hood except for me, my older brother was raised in the hood but when they had me we had moved to not the burbs but a normal ok middle class part of Boston you know. I have it a lot better than a lot of people I know\n\nIt makes me feel guilty that I am so fucked up because it feels like I have no reason to be this way. Like I'm being selfish. i don't wanna be this way, my head feels so fucked up all the time. I've thought about suicide like a thousand times, I hit wax pens because I know there are no studies on it and theres a possibility that this shit's killing me, especially because I've seen so many kids on the news in the hospital because of it in my area. \n\nIt's like I'm secretly wishing death upon myself. Why. Why don't I wanna be here anymore. Why do I hate myself, how do I make it stop. My head always hurts I don't know whats wrong with me, I have no motivation for anything anymore I don't care about anything anymore and I don't know why. \n\nSorry this is all over this place, I just need someone who gets me to you know?

If sex feels good and people are attracted to another, then why is the world about gamy, poly or mono, why is there even a bound between individuals?\n\nThen someone told me a harsh truth:\"women s bodies are not here to make my miserable life more bearable\". That hits like a truck. I'm really not enjoying life, and that goes hand in hand with \"a relationship won't fix your problems\". It sure did with the guy that plays AL Caponein Boardwalk Empire... But back to me. It's true, women are not here to make my life bearable, they might not even be able to. Which got me thinking about two things:\n\nWhat is life about?\nWhat are relationships about?\n\nWhy do people pair up? How can they fall in love with one person, whilst many others are as attractive and interesting, if not more, or if not at least in a different way?\n\nI don't quite understand how relationships happen. I don't get how you can move on from one person to another. Sure people have flaws, but that's part of a person. The good and good times are what matters. People aren't all bad, for most of them, so why do they breakup?\n\nI don't understand monogamy at all.\nI got to get a crush here and there and try to forget about it, only to jump to another. But I have never really developed a hatred for a past crush. I can't see how you go from being intimate to stranger, you've got the best moments, they can happen again. And with so many people in the world, it's just a matter of building up another relationship... Are people just not willing to put the effort in? But which efforts is that to spend some fun with people.?\n\nI don't quite get what life is about either.\nYou learn things, you make things. But  unless you are a genius, your stuff won't matter much. You just need to learn how to get one thing done and do that for the rest of your life. And it's boring. Learning alone is very hard, and past a certain age you don't have the mibey to be studying full time with teachers. You can't really create things just because you want to, you need to learn the craft (back to learning alone) and you need creativity.\n\nI'm quite lost. I got the job I wanted, it's too hard for me, so I'll have to find something I can manage, with less money. I can't learn on my own, I've always had trouble learning, even if I had private tutors.

Nothing cool, out of the ordinary, or worthwhile ever happened around me, at the very best I knew some people, in college, who were sometimes part of the next level of \"coolness\" and social interaction and situations that I never got to be a part of, instead I was a boring part of their own lives whenever they did interact with me, when more appealing and exciting options were unavailable. \n\nSimilarly, never been anyone's first choice, but that ship has sailed.

Why do I keep doing that? Is it some kind of survival coping mechanism? I hate it so much.  By doing this, I basically keep what I really feel bottled up which is feeling desperate, alone and in need of affection. I have no girlfriend, friend, or a social life to speak of yet time and time again, I'll convince myself that I'm better off all alone and by myself, when in reality I wish to every fiber of my being that I had everything that I listed that I didn't have. I tell my self I'm strong and I can play this lone wolf character in my head but when I lay down to go to sleep at night, all I can think about is how much of a pathetic loser I really am. I used to watch a lot of romance flicks, some would even consider them \"chick flicks.\" I'm not into these movies per se but I guess looking back, I'd watch them because In a way I was vicariously living thru the leading male character, that would always get the girl. During the movie, I'd always pretend the guy was me, then the movie would be over and I'd be all alone in my room. That's where reality welcomes you back. I hate all this \"alpha\" and \"beta\" talk and which behaviors makes you which but I feel like if I had to label myself I've shown characters of both. I would have days where I feel like a strong, lone wolf alpha, not giving a fuck that I'm single and alone. Next thing you know, I feel like some pathetic loser, who's still technically a virgin at 25 years old. Ironically I'd try to emulate these alpha guys from tv shows and movies that I've watched but then I'd walk out into the real world and I'd get reminded again that I'm a pathetic, lonely, loser. It's like I'm torn from what I want to be and what I know I can be to what I am right now. I try to do things to make myself the best version of myself but I've been trying for years and I always end up back where I started or even further back, mentally and emotionally drained even more. I hear about guys that are lonely for a long time and they finally get out of it at a certain age, but I have two specific fears regarding that. One is resentment towards myself and the future person that I'd be sharing my life with and emotional baggage. It's like let's say few years from now I find someone and there is a real chance of getting with this person. Who is to say that I won't hold resentment towards myself and not the girl specifically but the situation because I didn't find her sooner and how people rejected me before and now with my youth wasted, I finally have someone? I'd beg the question on why I couldn't of enjoyed my younger part of my 20's with this person that would accept me for me, why later when I'm older? Those years, you can't get back. Second fear is emotional scarring and damages. I'd hope that in any future relationship I wouldn't bring my mental and emotional baggage into it and sabotage the relationship but there is a real chance that could happen. What if I find the person I've been looking for and I fuck it up because all of my mental problems? All the years of isolation and being a social recluse, I know that I've developed a slew of mental health problems and disorders, a lot that are not diagnosed.

Whilst in that relationship I burnt bridges with friends, family and anyone else I cared about, just to \"prove\" to the person I was with that i loved them. \n\nWhen i finally got out of that position i felt refreshed, free for the first time in a while. and it was good. i rebuild friendships, reconnected with family, got a better job, improved my life as a whole. for the first three months i felt invincible and more confident that i have ever been. \n\nDespite this, despite having more friends, better relations with family, and a broader social circle. in the last 9 months my confidence has slowly spiraled down and down further, lower than it was when I was in that relationship. I feel more isolated and more alone, lacking real connection and love. \n\nIts not like the people around me don't care, they absolutely do, my housemates are supportive, my parents will always listen and be there to take my shit, but i just feel hollow. like something is missing. and I Can't figure out what it is. and my mind keeps wondering back to that relationship, not the person, but the feeling of being more than just myself. being part of someone else and them being a part of me. and i miss that feeling. True that spark died out with that person before, primarily because it got to a point where no matter what I did for them it wasn't as good as they wanted. I Wasn't enough. and i think that creeping feeling is what keeps me where I am right now. \n\nI spend 4-5 months after that relationship sleeping around with people, even had a FWB for a short time. but it felt null, like it was nothing. Sex doesn't feel the same as it did before, there's been no fire, no passion in my life for well over a year. to the point that the most exciting things to happen in my life these days are Game releases. \n\nIve tried Tinder, Bumble, PoF, Even a short spat on Grindr.

I have friends ive met in class but no one I\u2019ve hung out. All I have are my high school friends in a group chat. We\u2019re all busy so we don\u2019t always talk. I\u2019m not close to everyone in that group. On snapchat, my friend who used to have like a 230+ streak with me stopped after I accidentally lost it. Now she just doesn\u2019t snap that often and we\u2019ll lose a streak after a few days. Does that mean anything?\n\nThis is keeping me up at night because I\u2019m so introverted, I have no idea how to make friends anymore. One of my close friends, Person A,  from high school suddenly stopped snapchatting and talking to me. I texted her asking if I did anything to offend her and she left me on \u2018read\u2019 and never replied. I really couldn\u2019t believe someone would leave a friendship with no explanation. Eventually I realised I had offended her so many times in the past that it just added up and she finally got fed up with it. She had offended me many times in the past too but I decided to speak up about it since I cared. Person A never replied, and to save the friendship I asked a mutual friend, Person B, what Person A thought about me and why she didn\u2019t want to talk or patch things up.\n\nI was really scared to talk to Person A even though I valued our friendship. The issue was bugging me for weeks, so I kept talking to Person B about Person A every few days for 2 weeks. Within those 2 weeks I texted Person B my analysis and understanding of things because I was really socially awkward. Person B was sympathetic the first few times and urged me to confront and not hide. But afterwards she told me my overanalysing of Person A\u2019s actions and me trying to read people was sickening. Especially since Person A was carrying on with her life. She told me \u201cyou\u2019re on this pride game on your own\u201d and it shows you\u2019re clearly less motivated to salvage the friendship. She said that she thinks my pride thing comes from my inferiority complex. WTF.

Never did I think someone would love and care for me like that. \n\nAfter being previously hurt greatly I told myself I\u2019d never open up. But I let my guard down for her. She was so special.

I talked about how I found dating a lot easier than making friends, and I realized this was because when I date, I make a conscious effort to achieve a goal, of a relationship. With friends, I just kinda talk, and hope for something to come out of it. But friendships, for aspies anyway, are a lot like relationships where you have to ask questions, tell them about your self, and invite them to hang out.

I feel like a fraud when going in this sub, but I also don't relate to normal people either. Escaping FA just caused my depression to increase. Am i being ungrateful?\n\nFor context, I am 20M and a 2nd year in college. I haven't really contributed here, but I've visited this sub on and off since I was 16. This post isn't to brag. I just want to share my experience, because I believe what may happen to me could happen to many in here if by chance they escape FA. This may come off as an \"off my chest\", but I want to see what other members of this sub think of it. \n\nI want to start off by saying that I believe my escape from FA was purely a fluke, and nothing more. I don't have any redeeming qualities. I am unattractive, below average intelligence relative to my peers, and socially inept. I've made a net of 0 friends since starting college (I've made 5 friends in my first year, and 1 friend in my second year, but none of them talk to me anymore). I have 2 friends who I already knew from high school. I know most of you have similar, probably worse stories.\n\nLike all of you, I graduated high school a kissless virgin with little friends. The only interaction I had with girls was when they were forced to work with me on assignments. As a result, I put a lot of pressure on myself when starting college, knowing this was going to be my only shot at redeeming myself before joining the workforce and things got exponentially more difficult. \n\nIn an effort to make sure I escaped FA, starting my senior year of high school, I put as much effort as possible into making it a reality. I went to the gym 6 days a week, I worked jobs so I could buy more expensive clothes, I forced myself to listen to popular music and watch popular TV and movies I didn't really like so I could be more relatable and hold a conversation better. I was extremely particular about everything in myself, making sure I got good grades and not messing up my image worse than before. My life was still intensely lonely, but having a goal to work towards, even if I knew it was an enormous long-shot, made things a little easier.\n\nA few months ago, at the start of the fall semester, my goal finally came true. I was at a party, standing in the corner by myself, when a girl randomly came up to me and started talking to me. I've approached many girls before to no avail.\n\nI'd like to think of this as the payoff for my effort to improve myself, but deep down I know this was just a big fluke. I had been to parties almost every weekend since starting college in order to maximize my chance of escaping FA. Not one time ever before in my life had a girl approached me. It was pure luck that this happened and unfortunately the rest of you all in this sub didn't get that luck. \n\nI will say that my efforts made having a conservation with her a lot easier, and I could tell when I was passing through the hoops that made her begin to like me. I managed to get her snapchat.\n\nThe following weekend I spent more time with her. Surprisingly, we got along really well. The next weekend, I said that I liked her, she said that she liked me, then we kissed (my first kiss) and decided to start dating. \nThe next 3 weeks we dated were amazing but also incredibly nerve-racking. I was extremely happy to finally have escaped FA and have someone who I cared about and also cared about me, yet I had a constant feeling of impending doom, that she was going to get bored of me and eventually ghost me. I couldn't escape the feeling of dread throughout the entire time I was dating. \n\nMany of you have posted that you wouldn't know what to do or how to be a good partner in a relationship if you escaped FA, and that was true for me. I gave it my best effort though, and I honestly thought things were going pretty well before it ended. Obviously not though, as the self-fulfilling prophecy came true, and after 3 weeks she stopped talking to me and ghosted me. We hadn't even had sex yet, so I'm still a virgin (LO fucking L). \n\nEven though deep down I knew this was going to happen, I spiraled into a depression worse than ever before. I stopped eating, developed insomnia, and my grades slipped. I still don't know exactly what went wrong because she won't even open my messages anymore. I've been suicidal for over a month now. I can't go more than a few minutes without thinking about wanting to die. \n\nI had thought before that if I escaped FA, and was in love for just a little bit, and even if it ended poorly, it would be better than having never escaped at all. I'm not sure if that's true anymore. I can't stop thinking about how the only chance I'll ever get slipped through my fingers. At least before I had a dream to work towards.\n\nThis sub used to be the only place I could go where I could truly relate to other people. Now I can't even do that. Sure I escaped FA, but I feel more alone, empty, and sad that ever before.\nWhat do you guys think? Am I being ungrateful? Should I just get over it?

It\u2019s just a small reminder to myself that even if you feel lonely and helpless, there\u2019s always hope and there\u2019s always opportunities to turn things around.\n\nThis particular entry was from October 13, 2017. At this time I was very alone and everyone I knew had no idea because I hid it so much. I hid it to the point where I created a journal in my google docs because I knew that there nobody would find it.\n\n//Starry Tears// \nI wait here in the numbing cold. I have a jacket, but am not wearing it because it\u2019s nice to feel the chill. I'm alone, and the silence is tranquil, yet loud at the same time to the point that it's deafening. The gentle sound of the grainery, and wind blowing is calming to me, but there is always a ringing in my head when I'm alone. It never really leaves, just stays and does nothing but wipe away my thoughts into oblivion. Where there is complete silence, there is sound, and where there is sound, there is silence. My world is black and white, but yet I dream in color. How can I learn to love who I have become? How can I just simply push aside everything I'm thinking and focus on what matters, when I don't even know what matters to other people? Maybe to them, it's sports, clothes, or everyone on their list of 100 friends that they'll forget about when they graduate. No. To me, I care only about people, but not in the ways I'd assume others do. For instance, when a person looks at a group of people, that's all they see; a group of people. When I look at a crowd of people, however, I see people who wake up every morning, have families, jobs, hobbies, and friends. I see more than what lies on the surface, or I'd like to think I do. I know there are some other people that think like me too, though. I'm nothing too special, but when will I ever meet one of these like-minded people? Once I know someone, I never forget them.

I finished middle school, the same day they all stopped talking to me again, I wasn't surprised, I just said \"huh\" when none of them replied at my messages, next 2 and a half months were spent in my room, I was playing video games, even tried to go PRO in one, I was the happiest, I didn't really care about not having friends, cause it was better not having them, than having the fake ones.\n\n1st September of 2018 came, I wanted to make new friends so badly, cause I didn't talk to anyone in over 2 months, the 1st day was awful, I made 1 \"friend\", we had similar interests, and we were friends for the next 2 months, not close friends,but the kind of friends that would only hangout at school, for some reason after those 2 months, I again started feeling depressed, he started acting like a jerk and quickly after that we just stopped hanging out at school, I invited myself at this new group of guys that I saw in class, we didn't really bond at all, I was just there being a somebody that hate, I was so lonely, I didn't know what to do, I didn't know what to do with my life anymore, I wasn't going to school that often(I would go to 3 out of 5 day), I knew I had 1 dream, it was to become a professional CS:GO player, the dream died, my parents didn't want to hear or see me playing that game or any other, I started getting even more depressed, the only thing that gave me some kind of reason to continue living is gone, fast forward to the end of the year, I finish the 1st year of HS, I don't even know how, my grades were so bad that I didn't even want to see them anymore. My parents let me play games again, this time they gave me a shitty computer, I couldn't even run the game without the computer turning off every 15 minutes, July and August went kinda good cause I discovered weed, it made my anxiety and depression affect less on me, and I would smoke it in my room, since I didn't go out of it all summer, cause I was on youtube and reddit literally 24/7, and that's how this summer went by.\n\n1st September of this year came, I had little hope that this school year would be better, the 1st day was actually the best day of my life, I saw the prettiest girl of my life, the one that I would only dream of, she was so unique, not at all like any other girl I saw, I didn't talk to her at all, but man, I wish I could go back in time and see her for the 1st time again, the group of \"friends\" I was in was weirded out by how she was dressed, but I fucking loved it. Couple of weeks pass by, everybody in school started ignoring me and acting like a was some kind of creep, I started getting bullied by 1 guy in school, I didn't know why, 1 guy from the group told me it was cause 1 girl from my class in middle school told him I had a sex with a guy (keep in mind that my whole country is homophobic, they hate gay people, they would literally kill them and torch them), I didn't have sex with anyone, I am not gay, but I kinda support gay people, nobody knows about it except me, everything started getting really shitty after that day, I the group I was in started making gay jokes about me behind my back, I started getting more and more depressed and anxious, I smoked more weed, it didn't help at all, I started taking xanax, that thing helped me with m anxiety, I was taking it the night before school, cause I don't sleep at all maybe 1-2 hours after i come from school, I felt happier while it was affecting me, when it's gone I feel like the world's worst man, I realized I can't function normally without it, I realized a lot of things cause of that, for example, the girl that I saw 1st day of school, I thought she would be a great girlfriend, I am wrong, she would be a great friend, cause she is different than everybody, she would be a great friend, I am so lonely that I don't think of girls as my \"future\" girlfriends, I think of them as best friends, well the different girl started getting more and more like the other girls, the only person in my life that I saw that was like me started being like everyone else.\n\nIn my mind there is few questions:\n\nWhen does it get better?\n\nDo I need to change myself so I can fit to other people?\n\nwhen am I going to find out what I want to do in my life?\n\nIs it really worth living?\n\nsorry for my English if it was bad, it's not my native language.", "subreddit": "ForeverAlone"}

Not Christina and not her heroin addiction and not my father and not society. **I** have chosen this in rebellion to everything. Because it's too fucking hard. Too much is expected of me. I do not have the inclination nor mental fortitude to analyze myself further for character flaws. I'm a good, intelligent, hard-working person and I'm extremely comfortable in that *fact*.

You know, if my problem merely comprised a lack of social interaction, there is a good chance I wouldn't be typing this out. In addition to being incapable of holding a conversation with peers, I am also a failure in the academic sense - I was supposed to attend university in Canada, but my sudden move to the US made it difficult for me to enroll in anything other than community college, especially considering that American standards for university admission are far different from Canada's. Two years later and I'm in the exact same institution, shoveling through the exact same shit. My life has always been defined by a sense of inertia, so I can't say I'm disillusioned by its current state. While my peers effortlessly forayed into the territories one would expect your average adolescent to enter for the first time - sex, romance, parties, socialization - I... I... became increasingly reclusive as I watched them, one by one, graduate to realms of experience I would never be exposed to. From a very young age, I understood that I had been relegated to the background of life, for whatever reason, and that the best I could hope for was some place in the limbo between mediocrity and outright failure. I knew it was over before it began. I contemplated suicide, as we tend to do, but as I stood before the noose fashioned from my iphone charger, I was unable to 'hang it up' knowing that my carcass would be discovered by family. It was too much.\n\nDuring my high school years, my personality was inconsistent. Funny and charismatic at one moment, depressive, combustible, and silent the next. I suppose I had a robust set of opportunities to turn things around, despite the fact that I was always heavyset (until recently). I was never inundated with women, but I had several chances, all of which I actively ignored due to depression. Two were seniors who approached me when I was fifteen, another two were members of my grade. I've had a few in college as well, but I have no idea how to strike up a conversation with anyone, let alone a member of the opposite sex. If I were to talk to them, they would just cringe at my autistic ass and turn heel without a second thought, so I just pretend not to notice and then pray that I will be socially competent enough to seize the next opportunity that comes my way (none have come since last year). My interests, manner of speech, etc are so far removed from social norms that there is no way I can re-integrate myself without making some serious alterations to my personality. Everytime I end up in a social situation, I am incapable of relating to the people I'm conversing with. I am not socially adept enough to smuggle a friendship through the impenetrable barrier of alienation that cordons off every stranger I meet, so I just nod, say hello, make the occasional boring, inoffensive joke, and pray to god that I can be left alone. Deep down, I know I'm going to work towards this boring degree, go into an utterly underwhelming work environment, and become an NGO-subsidized drone whose entire life consists of the prefix to, \"...and \\*that's\\* when I met Carla\", or whatever the fuck. But there will be no Carla, or cult, or magic solution, or deus ex machina bullshit, just a winding, interminable road of misery that will last until the day I keel over.

I spend a fair share of my free time trying to help others here in their time of need. Helping you guys (if I have haha!) is helping me realise the reasons I love trying to help you all.

I _never_ want anyone to feel that way nor suffer like that either. \n\n2. Growing up, I never felt I had the support I needed (I have particular difficulties but have overcompensated for them for years) to progress in particular facets of my life. It is only now that I am truly beginning to convalesce. Equally, I _never_ want anyone to lack the support they need.\n\n3. I genuinely love that you're all strangers. I think it's so cool.

{"post_id": "dzv9uj", "created_utc": 1574393841, "title": "Needing Advice, on Staying Motivated to Change Where I am Now", "author": "vladysnepo", "self_text": "I had a online relationship with a girl I met online on a Discord server. We chatted a lot and often through video calls, and my relationship with her felt amazing, having somebody I could talk to and be completely open with. I was a shut-in at the same time, a third time university drop-out because I often got bored and incredibly lonely at my university. I haven't had meaningful friends for ages, but spending time with her was always more than enough to make me feel whole.\n\nI wanted to make something real out of this bond I had with her, so I worked a part-time job to save up money to finally meet her this last summer. I live in Canada, and she lives in Australia, so budgeting for the trip was a nightmare, but I was determined to meet her in person. Things in the last few months got worse with her, as she held everything wrong I did against me, even though I was forgiving to her whenever she slighted me.\n\nIt finally came time to the trip, and she was telling me things about some new friends she met in person. I had a bad feeling about these conversations, but decided to trust her that she wouldn't do anything to hurt me. Turns out during my flight to Australia, she had fallen for some guy, and was dishonest about being in a relationship with me. I met her the first day in Australia, and we met. For just 5 minutes, but she looked uncomfortable around me, and I felt my heart sink. She left soon after and broke up with me over text. I was devastated. I didn't bother to stay anymore, and took the first flight back home.\n\nShe messages me about how life's so much better now, that she no longer felt unstable and miserable around me, how she was in love with her new boyfriend, how her family approves of him, and how she feels motivated again with her studies. I was really hurt, hearing that from her, how quickly she turned against me. I'm still hurting sometimes now.\n\nI lost a relationship that genuinely made me happy, my first girlfriend and relationship ever. I have very little experience with women, but I haven't even gone as far as to hug one. But she was my everything to me, and those few months afterwards left me in total darkness. Who does that? It seems for cruel and inhumane, to create and bond and then quickly destroy it for somebody more convenient and better than I.\n\nThings have changed now. I go to the gym, workout and I feel a bit better. Dieting to reduce my weight. Going to college now in a program I really accel in. But I still feel like a huge part of me is missing. I would often just spend my free time gaming, but now I joined this Meetup app to meet new people. Yet I can't seem to find meaningful friends. I don't really know how. I don't want to give up yet, but each time I feel lonely and left questioning my own worth and if I can ever find that burning passion in me again like I had for this relationship.\n\nWhat I know is that I want to move on, and learn to be okay being single, happy and content with my life. But it's really hard, because I'm a very envious person, even come off as cold or hostile to others. I'm really bad with finding the right people and making meaningful friendships. I'm not asking for many friends, just ones that are good for me. I also want to learn how to create social connections and bonds, especially starting from scratch, having been isolated for 3 years. I keep going to different group. How can I remain patient and not get discouraged? I really want to change things for the better and find meaningful friends and hopefully one day a special somebody that can make me feel alive. My \"strong alone\" philosophy is breaking down, and I am having a hard time maintaining it.\n\nI just need advice on how I can remain optimistic and continue to progress with positive changes. Maybe even advice on what I can do to further improve myself or social skills. Thank you for reading.", "subreddit": "lonely"}

Early last year i was a part of this little movement thing started by 2 friends. The goal was to basically encourage people to write letters of appreciation to eachother. The person receiving the letter should only open it when they are having a bad time and it would remind them that they are cared for. The movement didnt last long considering that everyone involved was in highschool and busy.\n\nI really supported the message and was the graphic designer for all the social media stuff. Even after everyone stopped putting effort into spreading the message, i still thought it was an amazing idea. Eventually i put my own anxieties aside and wrote 2 letters, 1 for each of my 2 closest friends. I poured my heart in soul into them and hoped that when they do end up opening it, it would make them feel a little better. I got a response from one friend thanking me and never heard from the other. \n \nThe thing is, during my shower i realized that i never received a letter. I know its wrong to do things and expect something in return but i would have loved to get my own letter. There have been so many instances where i needed one, and yet i dont have one to read. Now i only have one friend, all my other friends stopped talking to me after we graduated. My closest friend of 6 years seemed to just forget about me. Ill never get a letter back from her... \n\nBut if im being honest, im still waiting for my own letter. It seems like everyone involved in the movement got at least one letter. Idk why i didnt. It seems like i was just forgotten and thats not exactly the best feeling in the world. But man it would've been cool if someone had gone through the effort of writing one just for me.

In college the first girl I really really liked used me and \"dated\"me for 2 weeks just to make me happy then quickly broke it off due to \"distance\" (2 hours away). I did fine in college, i had fun but whenever it came down to actually dating someone, they never wanted to.   \n\n\nAfter college a friend and I started talking more, but this time, timing was the problem. She moved away, then she moved back and then I was moving away. Now shes totally gone from the area. At least shes happy now with her current boyfriend.   \n\n\nAnd just a few hours ago, the girl I've been good friends with for the last year, she's finally single and shes open to dating. She's (was) perfect for me. Weird as i am, we got along perfectly, I've never been this comfortable around someone in a long time. It felt good, it felt right.  I go for it cause at this point im just swimming in circles waiting and waiting for a chance. She says no, why? Because were in the same class and were friends. BUT if we werent friends/in the same class probably. I'm sorry but dont we want to date our best friends, doesnt that make the relationship easier? I'm just at a loss of words. I didnt lash out at her after he response i was nice and said okay. I cant tell you how many times when she was dating her boyfriend id get texts about The Office, i turned her onto the show. And how much she hated when Pam was with Roy and how she wants Jim and her to be together. And I just felt like just maybe, maybe thats what we'll be. But were not, and i guess never will be. I cant tell you how many times shes called me just wanting to talk about her day or facetime me on a saturday night cause shes sick and (while living with her boyfriend) wanted someone to talk to for 2.5 hours.  \n\n\nI'm just alone, all i want to do is be loved and give love to someone and apparently thats too flipping hard. I dont know what im doing wrong or if i'm just going after the wrong girls. I'm 26 and have a great career ahead of me and some days just suck. Waking up and seeing your friends getting married/having kids/ buying a house. I know i'll get that someday but right now its just a far away dream/fantasy. I've never been the one to just walk up to girls at bars, i have a speech impediment which gets worse if i've been drinking. So with all my friends and friends of friends getting married and stuff im just sad.  \n\n\n  \ndownvote me idk, idc, im just having a pity party and really have no idea where to go or what to do.", "subreddit": "ForeverAlone"}

Normally this wouldn\u2019t bother me as much, but I know she\u2019s makes less of an attempt to call me since I\u2019m friends with the person she talks to way more often. They call each other everyday, I know this because they post about it all the time, the jokes they\u2019re making and how much they want to see each other and stuff like that. I\u2019m insanely jealous but I hide it so I don\u2019t ruin my relationship with both of them. But its gotten so bad I had to delete my social media over it. I think about it all the time now, like what do I not have? What did I do wrong? She used to constantly say I was the one she was most comfortable talking to, but that all went away.\nI\u2019ve known her for 3 years and they hit it off in 2 months. \n\nI\u2019m getting this all off my chest because she call ditched me again (thats what Im calling it now, when she promises me she\u2019ll call back but never does). She said someone was calling her, and ik its shitty to assume but it was probably her other friend. This isn\u2019t the first time this has happened. It was the one time a month she calls me, too.\n\nI\u2019m not mad at either of them, but it just hurts so much. Seeing them be such close friends makes me so damn sad. It just reminds me of what I don\u2019t have. Funny thing is I always talk about have I was afraid of getting replaced but here I am. I have no one to talk to about this. I only have about 4 other close friends but they\u2019re either too awkward around me to talk or have other people they talk to (or they\u2019re directly connected to this).  It feels like no one -wants- to talk to me anymore. Ik I should try and talk to my close friend about this, and I have, but nothing ever changes. She still rarely ever calls me, and I\u2019m left with no one to talk to.\n\n\nTldr; my closet friend doesn\u2019t consider me her closest anymore and is now closer to my other friend and its fuckin me up.\n\nEdit: Yeah, she was talking with my other friend last night.

We shared all problems, pain, feelings, happiness, everything. And we stayed talked for 8 months and I had been already started saving money from my internship to go meet her. \n\nWe are from different countries and such far away, there was 10000km between us.\n\nHer birthday was getting close and was her 18 birthday, I listened her and prepared everything to go meet her in person. I prepared my bags, went to another state, 8 hours in a car. Took 4 planes till arrive at her region, almost 30 hours running into airplanes. But I arrived there, at her region at russia and I came worried till the outside of airport. She was waiting me far away, shy as always, she came walking and hugged me. It was the most strong feeling on my life and I thought this for a long.\n\nSo we stayed living the first month at her house together with her parents. It was really amazing and I should tell that I wish very much to marry with her.\n\nAt the end of the first month we needed went to another city but we didn't think that we would need live together. We went there and was so hard to find an apartment for us, but we found a bad house.\n\nBad but good, together it was amazing, I couldn't guess that i would live so much things only on 3 months. My soul was already tied to her soul, my love was flowing up, I was dying but there was a problem...\n\nI could stay only 3 months and we couldn't marry so speedy, I needed come back to my country.\n\nWe lived so much things and had so much feelings together, her university is a hell and impossible, she used to study everytime and I was always there with her. Her company was the best thing I had on this life, and then at the end she needed went to live in a shared house with another girls while I went to my country.\n\nWould be everything fine, if there she could talk me as before. But no, I feel as I lost my soul there, I can't survive. She is busy, the girl that live with her always come to stay with her and study, and then she can't call me, we don't see each other, we don't text much, we haven't cool talks. I miss to have her love so much, I don't know what to do anymore.\n\nI know that her uni is hard, I know that she tries to talk me. But I have been suffering alone to save her from this hell. She is too busy with the people annoying her, I even can't care of her because I CAN'T TALK HER. Often I don't know if she ate, I don't know how is she feeling, I can't care if her anemia because we are too far... I feel so useless.\n\nI am broken of miss, and I am not able even to listen her voice. She wrote a letter before I went and asked to I read in airplane. Now when I hold it, I feel as my heart will explode. I get headache, I get panic, I am 10000km from her and I don't find a good work. I haven't her company, I hide my feelings to she feel better and more calm. Everyday I feel as my world disappeared, it's already one month far away and everything just get worse. I try be a man and be strong, but everything remember of her, we lived together and just a simple coffee makes me die. I just see a cat and want to die, because she love cats.

This is when it all turns around, when you read this! You might think your situation is hopeless, but it isn't... There's still hope, and you can make it through the pain and the sorrow and become stronger for it!\n\nThe first thing to know about women is that they don't care about how you look, I mean they do, but only because of how it makes them feel... Talking to someone attractive and cool makes them feel like they are someone who is also attractive and cool, whereas talking to someone who is awkward and unatractive makes them feel awkward and unatractive.\n\nThe one way for you to get a girl who is into you, if you do not improve, is some girl falls for you and happens to be very brave and strong so she does all the work for you. Luck is already a big part of finding someone, so you must optimize every last detail. \n\nBravery is very important, you must be willing to put yourself out there. If a girl shows interest you must reciprocate, because most women are very cowardly and they aren't willing to put up with the discomfort of being repeteadly rejected. It could be something as small as speaking slightly more intimate with you, and if you do not mirror that behavior then it won't happen for you.\n\nIt's of paramount important that you view yourself as someone attractive... You might look in the mirror and see an Ugly SOB, but looks are subjective... A person could have a lot of flaws and still be attractive, and even very attractive people like celebrities could, if you knew them, look very ugly to you.. Especially if they do not have the confidence to view themselves as unatractive...\n\nHow you view yourself dictates how people treat you, of course someone could still treat you as ugly, but if you see yourself as someone attractive then you will definitely put up more of a fight... Even just having the knowledge that you could be seen as attractive will make you put up a fight... Respect is important, and you must demand it!\n\nA lot of \"objectively\" unatractive people like Lil Wayne, Post Malone, to a degree Eminem though his issue is more low self asteem that having a rough apperance, manage to pass themselves off as attractive... Short people like Swae Lee gets tonnes of sex, despite being what, 5'4\"? These people are attractive but they manage to make themselves appear attractive, in large part due to being celebrities, but also they have self asteem... This makes them appear attractive, and the most important thing to get out of this is the fact that it IS possible to be attractive despite being short or ugly, it just takes a tonne of more work...\n\nYou're going to have to put in a lot more work to be seen as attractive than most people... This is because most people intergrate into society and become a part of it, while you grew into an outsider... You grew out of society and became someone foreign to the society... We live in a society, man! \n\nEven being ugly there are opportunities, you can be seen as the grizzled, ugly tough guy, you could be seen as a hard working ugly lumberjack type... Masculinity isn't defined by being pretty, in fact that's a feminine ideal... Men are more judged on how strong they are, how confident they are, how in control of their emotions they are etc etc...\n\nThis hasn't helped me completely escape FA, but it's helped a fair bit... I'm still waiting for the right girl to come along, but for now I hope this can be helpful to someone who is struggling to be seen as attractive, and I know a lot of this is meme advice territory, most normies spew out meme advice for a reason... It's definitely helped me tho, so good luck !! Cheers!", "subreddit": "ForeverAlone"}

{"post_id": "e0dru4", "created_utc": 1574487925, "title": "There Is A Void In Me I Don't Know How To Fill", "author": "NuclearSteeze", "self_text": "Maybe the best way to start this is a backstory about me (sorry for the long read):\n\nI am a 23 year old guy. I moved to the USA from India when I was 2 years old (so I am a u.s citizen and westernized in every way other than the fact that I can speak Hindi and eat Indian food more often than the average American).\n\nI have always been a loner. I tried to be cool and make friends in elementary school but I would always get teased and bullied. It was worse in middle school. So, in high school, I became quieter. I was still teased, but not nearly as much, because I would just keep to myself, assuming nobody would want to be my friend and that I would just have to deal with it. Well, as a result, this led to me being totally socially awkward and underconfident into college as well. I should also add that this whole time I have been having a porn addiction. I went to a good Engineering college, but I had no social life (like 0 friends) the whole time and an awful GPA (literally just enough to graduate but I failed so many of my major courses. I literally barely made it). Of course, you gotta have a good GPA to get internships and to get a full time position, companies look at your experience (I had no internships other than this research thing I kinda did at the university).\n\nSo, when I graduated last May 2019 with a bachelor's, at 23, I had the following:\n\n1) no friends\n2) never been on a date or any form of intimacy with anyone \n3) I was broke and lived with my parents because I was unemployed\n\n\n\nObviously, I was thinking about ending it all (my professor said I should speak with the college therapists because he thought I might have depression. Maybe he was right but I never have been one to care about my mental health. I just tell myself to stop being so pitiful and deal with it). I had 0 confidence in myself for a whole 6 months as I made futile attempts searching for a job. I ate so much that I became medically obese.\n\nAnyways, something really good happened for me recently. I got a job. A job that is damn near my dream job. Like it works in the exact industry that I have dreamed of working in since a young boy (but gave up on thinking it was just a fantasy) and it pays well (not 6 figures or anything but still pretty solid). I have been working for about a week now. It's a ton of work (more than 40 hours a week for sure) but I really enjoy it even when i get mentally exhausted. \n\nBut here is the thing, despite having this great job, I still have this void in me. I think it is because I still don't come out of my shell. I still hate myself on some level. My team's director invited me to go out with some of the employees for happy hour and walking around downtown. I told him maybe, but I dont think I am going. I think I am just going to lay in my room being a loner as always. I just assume the worst. I have tried going out with people, but I always just end up being kind of left out because I am afraid of involving myself in anything because I never feel like I am truly welcome. \n\nAnd of course, I do want intimacy. I just think I will be one of those few people that will have to die without it (some people just go on without some things) but it makes me sad thinking about it. I do want a girlfriend, but I have never asked a girl out because I am too damn self-conscience (my body, my lack of a exciting personality). But I am a 23 year old virgin who has never kissed or dated so I feel like my ship has sailed since obviously women my age would want a a guy with experience (sure, there is that 0.001% that would be cool with it, but how on earth would I find them and, since there are so few, chances are high we might not even be compatible).\n\nOne thing I am working on is getting some hobbies. I will have to work some more to get the funds to do them, but that shouldn't be long. But here is the thing. No man is an island. I really was hoping that this lovely job would completely fill my void, but it hasn't. Because it's the weekend now, and I am back to my self-pity shit. Also the place I live in and work is a crowded downtown area, so I am just a loner in a crowd. I don't know how to build relationships, platonic or romantic, with anyone. I'm just \"cool\" to be around occasionally I guess.\n\nAnyways, I feel like I am rambling now. So basically I want to know how to get out of my shell and stop feeling pathetic.", "subreddit": "lonely"}

Without her here, I feel like I've lost a part of me. I miss her cuddles, the sound of her purr, the way she'd ask for affection, her little meow when she was hungry or knew she was doing something wrong...

No luck, but they took my name and number in case someone brings her/a cat like her in. My vet also said they'd put her photo/info up on their Facebook.

Please give your furry family an extra cuddle for me.\n\nUpdate: I got a call from my vet earlier saying that someone had seen a black cat on the side of the road close to where I live - no longer living. My husband went out to see if he could find her with no luck. Chances are that if it had been her, her body would've been cleaned up by the city or taken by another animal.

I kinda feel bad that I didn\u2019t like her back but I just couldn\u2019t get into her plus having nothing in common at all didn\u2019t help. \n\n\nIt kinda hurt my confidence too in a way which I kinda hate to say. I don\u2019t really know why, but I guess just assuming out of all the girls around my age that I did work with, the one who did like me was the very last one that I would want to do something with in terms of relationships/dating compared to the other woman I worked with around my age (I wasn\u2019t really attracted to my other former women coworkers either but you know what I mean).

Whenever people talk to me it's either because they are the kind of person to talk to people (and they subsequently stop talking after they discover what I'm like), or I start talking to them and they keep listening to me because they're too polite to tell me to go away. They both try to avoid me, never initiate conversations, never come up to me to say hi etc. I've given up, I don't feel like going out to bars/clubs and getting drunk and nobody ever shows any interest in me. When I try to talk to people I fail horribly, nobody cares about the stuff I find interesting, I can't hold a conversation for the life of me.", "subreddit": "lonely"}

{"post_id": "e0nkqb", "created_utc": 1574540856, "title": "Another lonely night (Just me ranting)", "author": "OriginalGnomeHunter", "self_text": "  \n\nI was supposed to go on a date tonight. The firs one in a long time. And the first one in an even longer time that I was actually looking forward to. Not just some random encounter with whoever would agree to meet up with me, that I had to drag myself out the door for, just to get some adult interaction to keep myself from going completely insane. Some apathetic right swipe on tinder just because no one else was biting. No, this was, for once, with a woman that seemed genuinely interesting to me. I was actually excited about this one. But alas, it fell through.\n\nSo here I am. Again. Sitting in the glow of the screen, next to my dog, feeling the loneliness fall upon me like a heavy blanket of self-despair that just leaves me incapacitated and unable to muster up the energy to do anything meaningful.\n\nSo, I guess this night will end up like all the others. Alone. Siting in the couch watching some crap on Netflix I've seen a hundred times before. Constantly checking my phone just in case I've missed a message from someone... I never have... I can't even remember the last time I received a message from anyone who just wanted to know how I'm doing, or whether I'd be up for doing something. I could try taking the initiative and call up someone in my ever-shrinking group of friends, if I can even call them that anymore, to see if they want to do anything... No... Wait... I already did that... They are, as usual, to busy.\n\nI just realized, I have absolutely no single friends. I guess it makes sense then. They're spending time with their families. Besides, why would they want some sad divorcee around, reminding them that their happiness can go down the shitter at any moment. \n\nMy least favorite holiday of the year is coming up. New-years-eve. A night I dread. A night where everyone is out celebrating and having a good time. And, once again, I have absolutely nothing to do. Last year I celebrated the night with my kids, so at least I could tell myself that even if I had been invited to something, I probably wouldn't have been able to go anyway. This year they'll be with their mother. I wonder what my excuse will be then. I'll probably end up sitting at home, curtains closed, so no one can see the sadness inside, getting drunk, watching TV, wallowing in my self-pity. The clock will reach midnight. The spam-texting of well-wishings and 'Happy New Years' will commence. But all I'll receive is silence.\n\nI don't think anybody really knows me. Why would they? I've become a master of putting on the brave face when I'm out. I don't know how much longer I can keep up this charade. But then again, what's the alternative? \n\nI just noticed the posting-rules in the sidebar. *2. Behave like you would in real life...* Right... In that case I'd might as well delete this whole thing and tell you all about how great things are going.\n\nWhat's the alternative? Actually telling people how I'm feeling? I don't think so... People generally don't want to invest their time in someone unless they're being entertained. I mean, you might be able to get away with letting out small glimpses of yourself from time to time. But unless you're able to snap right back out of it, and keep on partying, you're not worth the investment. Fake it till you make it, right? Well... I'm getting tired of faking it.\n\nI'm a very introverted person. Not shy. Just introverted. For those of you who think that those two are the same thing, I have to say, they are not. To give an example: I was recently in a group situation. Conversations were flowing. I was, as usual, the fly on the wall, who no one were really paying any attention to. At some point the conversation turned to a very sexual topic. Allot of people in the group were left red-faced and embarrassed to say anything. But, for once, I had something to say. I spoke my mind, and I were celebrated for it. You see the difference? For once, just for a few seconds, I was the center of attention, the life of the party. And I loved it... I asked myself: How can I be this person all the time? A person who is entertaining, who people pay attention to, who people want to be around? Would I even be able to endure being that kind of person?... I had no answer. I still don't.\n\nMaybe it's me. Maybe I'm just not worth peoples time. Maybe I'm just not interesting. I try to connect with people, but I always just end up drawing a blank. I recently went on a week-long study trip with my university. We would be close to each other for a whole week. There would be a bit of drinking involved. I thought it would be the perfect opportunity to make some connections. People would be a bit freer. I would be a bit freer. Free to get out of my own damn head. But yet, nothing. My mind was numb. I've heard people describing how they, in social situations, panic, and can't think of anything to say. But it wasn't that. My mind was just blank... Nothing... I didn't even try to think of anything to say. A few even came up to me and tried to make some sort of connection. But still, nothing... What the fuck is wrong with me? Why don't I grab the opportunities that's presented right in front of me? I hate myself for this.\n\nDo I think to highly of myself? Should I just take whatever I can get? As a friend? As a companion? As a lover? Are whoever I can get to interact with me a reflection of my worth? Or is this just it? Is this my life now? Is this as good as it's going to get? Should I just embrace the loneliness and accept that this is my life now?\n\nIf you've sat through this whole thing, I thank you. I don't really know what I hope to accomplish by it, but I thank you.", "subreddit": "lonely"}

She's getting a graduate degree from UCLA and asked me to come with her to meet some of her schoolmates for a social networking happy hour.  I normally hate that kind of shit and I definitely don't drink alcohol (and never have) but figured it would be less awkward than being an asshole just staying at her place while she goes out, especially since she told them I was already coming.\n\nWhen I got there, plenty of people had already shown up and my hot friend had me meet the people there.  I met a lot of guys and chicks who were all there waiting to go to some other event.  My chick friend introduced me and was confident I'd make a good impression, but the fact is that the women there really made it pretty clear that they weren't interested in talking to me.  I got mostly generic questions and one word answers before they turned around to talk to other people in their group.  The guys were more friendly and a couple of them were actually really cool and I may end up hitting them up to hang out when I am in the area next time.  But yeah, I didn't have much luck being a relatively short (I was shorter than all the men there) guy on the spectrum who isn't very attractive.  Her new best friend there, who she had been hyping for weeks, was particularly rude, and I let her know that I pretty much never wanted to see that chick again when I come back to visit.\n\nSo yeah, that's my bar experience.

I get depressed because well I never had that. I never had a small group of friends to hang out with and go on adventures with as kid. I spent all my childhood and teenage years being a shut in and a loner. Not only that but I missed out on other adolescent experiences. \n\nGod I feel so behind everyone. I hate being a man child because it makes it so much more difficult to relate to other adults. \n\nYeah I know I can still make friends as an adult and go on adventures but it's harder to make friends as an adult. Most people your age are focused on school, their careers, relationships, and settling down and having a family.

They were closer to each other than they were to me (of course), and I slowly began to feel like I was being used. Example 1, we liked to smoke. I bought a lot of stuff for us to use. I didn\u2019t have to, but I felt like they wouldn\u2019t like me anymore if I didn\u2019t do it. Example 2, I gave them a key to my apartment to watch it while I went back to my hometown to take care of my dad because he broke his leg. They never gave it back, and they started coming over regardless of whether I was there or not. I couldn\u2019t come home and just rest without them being there. I couldn\u2019t go to sleep. They told me to kick them out if I wanted to but it felt like an empty offer. I don\u2019t know. Example 3, they did everything they could to spend every free moment with each other. They go to stores, go eat, and I would go with them sometimes, but it always seemed clear that the gold standard for them was going without me. They would talk about parties and plans I wasn\u2019t invited to right in front of my face. I would find myself so unhappy after they left. \n\nYesterday night was the straw that broke the camel\u2019s back. I have a potassium deficiency that gets to me when I\u2019m very tired or dehydrated and it caused me to pass out, and all they did was watch me get up, say \u201cyou want some water?\u201d, tell me to go to bed, and leave in the course of 20 minutes.\n\nSo today, I packed up all the things that were theirs in a box, handed it to them, and asked for my key. I was so angry I couldn\u2019t say a word except asking for my key. They promptly left. I texted them everything I had been feeling over the past few months, and they proceeded to take to Twitter and subtweet that I permanently lost \u201cmy only true friends\u201d. We got into a screaming match over FaceTime. I told them once I quit smoking, I assumed the friendship was over. Why? That\u2019s all we ever did. The friendship revolved around it. I didn\u2019t get invited to the other things they did. The majority of my time with them was spent in my own apartment, just smoking and smoking. If I chose not to smoke they would take their stuff and smoke somewhere else, and I\u2019d never see them again. And they called me ignorant and irrational for saying these things. I hung up on them. \n\nThis is one of many friendships I\u2019ve had that have ended badly, but it\u2019s by far the nastiest demise I\u2019ve ever experienced. I feel like I never make the right choices. I don\u2019t know who I am anymore. I don\u2019t know how to make friends in a way that works for a long time. I can\u2019t get close to anyone without feeling used. I just need someone to tell me I\u2019m not worthless.

I was sitting next to a woman (probably on a date, but it was difficult to tell, since my dreams have been really surreal recently, sometimes with no concrete setting), and she took my hand. It was truly amazing. She smiled at me, and I put my other hand on her arm. Here's the kicker: I felt her warmth, and the texture of her skin. It was amazing. It lasted about 10 seconds. I **always** forget about the warmth of a person's touch, and I'm only reminded about it very briefly on the extremely rare occasion I get to touch another human being (never in a sexual or romantic context), and also on this occasion. I daydream about it daily, but always forget about this aspect. I never knew dreams could bring such physical sensations. Since I'm unable to experience this irl, my brain is putting two and two together, to try and show me what it might be like. \n\nTo me, intimacy is still something that \"adults do\". At 24, I'm still in the same stage as a teenager waiting and wondering what his first kiss will be like. It's getting worse every year now. I'm a serious adult now, and it's surreal knowing that practically everyone now knows what intimacy is like. It's natural to them, like breathing and walking. A couple years ago, it wouldn't have been so bad, but things move fast for a lot of people between about 18-23, due to college/uni, etc. I've transitioned from being just a late bloomer, to an anomaly, an outlier.\n\nI've tried to get this point across on other subs (maybe this one as well), but I don't think people fully understood what I was getting at. I believe I should have experience those things within that specific age range. Later than average, but not stupid late. I missed my chance. I never had the confidence to try and date, but I decided to give it a go. I set myself a goal of getting at least a kiss before my 24th birthday, and I failed miserably. To rub salt in the wound, two girls I was supposed to have dates with cancelled, this was a few days before my birthday. It's like a slap in the face, or like some sort of practical joke. I feel like I'm now too old to experience the magical aspect of a first love, that it would be childish and pathetic. Not that it would be any less valid, but it just wouldn't be the same, since I'm now in my mid-20s, and I'm supposed to have mature relationships now. Sorry if this sound strange or doesn't make sense, but this is really nagging me.\n\nThanks for reading, and best of luck to you all.

Protection, validation, love, companionship, friendship, education, hell even basic shit like food and shelter. We (should at least) get most of these things from our parents/family/caretakers when we\u2019re very young. But as we age, we start to look outside of our immediate familial connections to find these things in other people. And in this pursuit of these things, many people don\u2019t acquire them. Hence loneliness. \n\nThis can often times lead to us forgetting our older connections to people who WERE actually there for us, who actually truly care about us. But is it the pursuit of these things like friendship and romance that make us forget our loved ones, or is it the absence of these desired connections that contribute to our isolation?\n\nI know this sounds like a pretty broad \u2018chicken or the egg\u2019 question, but it came to mind in the past couple of days. For the last few months I had been purposely avoiding my best friend of 7 years. I had convinced myself that they were better off without me since they had being moving on and vastly improving their life. They had successfully completed their schooling, found a job they were passionate about, and had become engaged to be married. Meanwhile, I\u2019m single and stuck working a dead end job while living with my mother.\n\nIt often baffles me how we could even be friends. I thought to myself that it was out of pity, that they saw how pathetic I am, and being the kind soul they are, took it upon themselves to befriend this worthless loser who had no one else. I\u2019ve tried to come out this person about my depression and troubled past. But when I did, they looked at me with horror and commented, \u201cI would\u2019ve never thought you went through all that, you seem so happy.\u201d I had a tendency to be a goofball as often as possible around them, to try and ensure they wouldn\u2019t leave me, to show that I at least had some \u2018entertainment value\u2019. Another time I opened up about my problems and why I was afraid to share them, stating that, \u201cI don\u2019t want to make upset, I know you don\u2019t like to hear this stuff,\u201d to which they replied, \u201cI don\u2019t want to hear it because I don\u2019t want to ever know that you\u2019re suffering.\u201d \n\nHearing that made me... angry.\n\nI know what they meant, that it would hurt them to know that I\u2019m going so much, but I thought to myself, \u201cOh, so you DON\u2019T want to hear me out after all? Don\u2019t let the loser inconvenience you with his problems, right? If it was YOU, I\u2019d want to hear everything so I could help you as best I can, guess you can\u2019t be bothered though, right?\u201d At this point I decided to cut them out completely, ignoring them when they would text/call. I figured once they thought I was ok, they\u2019d move on and forget about me, since, in my mind, they didn\u2019t really care about me.\n\nA few months later, their sister (who I worked with at the time) commented that my old friend wanted to talk, stating that they had thought I had forgotten about them. That was a blow, but not has hard as the one I received a few days ago. My friend texted me, informing that their mother (a woman who I had come to know over the years) had died. They wanted to know if I could make it to the funeral. This absolutely crushed me. I visited my friend the next day and apologized. I broke down and admitted that I had been intentionally ignoring them, and that I wouldn\u2019t do that anymore. I knew I had been an awful friend. But then....\n\nI couldn\u2019t help but escape the feeling that my friend only looked at me like there was something wrong with me. I was crying in front of them and they seemed as calm as ever. This is due to the fact that they are more than likely much more emotionally stable than me, but I still feel like I revealed too much, that I showed that there was a lot wrong with me. They of course consoled me and said that I shouldn\u2019t feel that way and that they\u2019d be there for me when they could.\n\nBut still... I still have this overwhelming urge to disappear from their life again. I don\u2019t want them to see me, to know just how screwed up I am. I\u2019m selfish, I know, I have been for a long time. I will admit, seeing my friend achieve all the things I wanted, romantic love, a meaningful career, other people who CARE about you, made me feel jealous. I\u2019ve often told myself I\u2019ll never achieve these, and fall into a spiral of self loathing that shuts others out. But I still, at the same time, WANT to be there for my friend, one of the very few people I can actually call a friend. Yet my mind still laments on my failings, and why I should give up.\n\nI wish I could turn this selfish part of my brain off, but I can\u2019t. I don\u2019t know what to do, except what I always do.

Beginning to become convinced that women are generally just selfish creatures waiting for Benjamin Franklin to break down their door and solve all their problems. \n\n\nSo I have an issue romantically in my life, I don\u2019t know what it is. Everyone seems to have a common input that I pick the wrong people to have in my life. \n\nI\u2019m 23, I\u2019ve had few women in my life and the relationships all ended terribly and I feel as if karma will haunt me forever. \n\nBack when I was 17, I really feel like I met the love of my life looking back on things, comparing the feelings I had then to the ones I have now, much more rash and extreme and passionate. I unfortunately being young and finally gaining my confidence had a lot of girls attention in highschool and I couldn\u2019t help myself but to talk to them, and one thing led to another and we broke up because she couldn\u2019t trust me and her best friend of the time (m) was in her ear for his own personal interests with my girlfriend at the time. Mr.try to steal your girl type. \n\nThen later on after that I separated myself from relationships for a long time, still a Virgin at 19, I say f*** it and I try to have something just casual with someone. I lost my virginity and got an STD and I\u2019ve had Erectile disfunction since. This experience really turned off those sexual hormones in my body that makes a younger man crave a sexual lifestyle. And from that point it just makes me dirty and no one seems to understand that. \n\nA year later (now 20 years old) I find myself dating someone 8 years my senior with a child. Thinking someone who wants to really kindle a nice homelife and strong foundation of a relationship. But as soon as sex was implemented, she told me I wasn\u2019t a man if I couldn\u2019t please her 100% of the time. At this point it hurt even more to hear about my issue being real for someone else rather than just something inconvenient for myself. \n\nFinally come time for my most recent relationship that went a year (22-23) She hadn\u2019t had a boyfriend and was a Virgin. I thought I did right in finding someone decent but a year down the line after talking wedding, kids names, dogs names, where we\u2019d live, etc. she cheated on me with some sleezebag and had no remorse for it. At the time I had a well paying job working 60+ hours a week to get a jump start early in my life for the life we both wanted together. She said I became boring, too into work. Even though all my effort at work was for what we had agreed we wanted together. She also took my erectile disfunction and told me that she never knew if she were doing things right, wanted to experience something different and didn\u2019t really care about what we had anymore, and wasn\u2019t willing to look back. \n\nI don\u2019t know what to do and I feel like I will pay back my dues for a 17 year old mistake the rest of my life. Women take advantage of my kindness and understanding and willing to be there for them every moment, my mom being a single mom without anything just me and my twin brother at 19. So I have a soft spot for women. But I\u2019ve only been hurt severely. Now with years of experience, I\u2019m tired of the beating, I\u2019m tired of being treated the way I am.

I would tell them to do something or to hurry and they\u2019d ignore me or laugh. I deserve it for being a jerk in the past.

I have been talking to her for about a month and I think she likes me, but that\u2019s not the point. My point is that I had a couple of friends going into high school and we were all really unpopular in 8th grade. I associated myself with 2 close friends and a couple good friends at the start of high school. I play football, so I did a summer camp and met someone who I considered my friend because I thought he was really chill and he had around 6 girlfriends throughout the camp, so I thought I could get a girlfriend with his help. I was wrong he didn\u2019t help at all. My other friend I met him in kindergarten and I was really close with his family and he was really close with my family. The reason I kinda lost those two friends was because my parents found out that the summer camp friend vaped and was not a good person over all. He tried to date my sister and talked shit behind my back. My other friend that is really close to me, made a racist Craigslist post about a slave and he got suspended and got all over the news. I\u2019m disappointed in him, but  he has done nothing like this before so I understood that is was a joke. It\u2019s just that I\u2019m called racist if I hang out with him.

And I get it, I really do. Feeling lonely is so horrible because not only does it make us feel worthless in the face of a society that constantly reminds us what a great, socially amazing life everyone\u2019s leading (as seen on Instagram etc) but it also makes us feel like something is fundamentally wrong with US as individuals. Believe me, I feel this 100%.\n\nBut today I learned this important lesson about perspective. We are hurting (mostly) because we are missing someone by our side in a particular moment. We feel lonely when we don\u2019t have plans on a Friday night, or when we wake up to no one laying next to us in the morning. But for some reason we believe that, because we are hurting in this moment, because we are alone in this moment, it means that no one can love us enough to care, no one in our life cares about us at all. But I believe that this is just our insecure, anxious brain speaking. \n\nI strongly believe that if we walk through life with open eyes and an open heart we will inevitably find the connection we long for. I mean, there are literally 7,6 billion people out there. And, as we can see in this sub unfortunately, a lot of people feel lonely, left behind or are hurting. A wise man once said \u201cwhat unites us as humans, is that we all suffer the same. We all experience loss, loneliness and pain. Suffering is the most universal experience we got, paradoxically, since to so many of us suffering feels like such a personal struggle.\u201d and if we take this as a \u201cstarting point\u201d it might help us realise that our feelings are not unusual, and we shouldn\u2019t be ashamed or beating ourselves up over them. We\u2019re all just human, we\u2019re all looking for connection. \n\nLife holds so many surprises for everyone, we just need to be brave enough to see them and act accordingly. Everyone of us is worthy of love and attention, and I just don\u2019t believe that loneliness is forever. So many people I\u2019ve gotten to know in my life felt lonely but never reached out, never tried making plans because they were afraid they would come of as \u201cneedy\u201d or \u201cuncool\u201d. So let\u2019s be that hand that reaches out to people, let\u2019s be more open minded and more thoughtful of the people surrounding us. Everyone of us is capable of finding the connections that can make us happy - this is just temporarily- I promise.", "subreddit": "lonely"}

I'm in high school at the moment, and I didn't really how much it sucked, until I got there. It's kind of like something just clicked in my brain and then all of a sudden I just started getting thoughts like, \"Am I good enough\" or \"What am I doing here.\" But, I've thought about these things at all before. I have such an incredibly amazing, kind family that truly cares about me, but I don't feel it. I mean I know they care, I do, it just doesn't register with me. I have never been able to talk to them about how I'm feeling, and that may be because I'm scared about what they'll say or I just don't know how to say things. Sometimes I will just cry for some random, stupid reason and they ask me to talk and I just there. They get pretty agitated about that, especially my mom; she's just trying to help, but it's just hard. It is so hard to try and piece all of my emotions together and actually tell people. Its like I can't trust anyone with anything, even though no one's ever done anything wrong to me to make me feel that way.\n\nOn top of my family felt issues, school is pretty rough sometimes. I have a group of \"friends\" I guess. I mean, they are the only people I ever spend time with at school. We are together in the morning and during lunch. But, I feel like I see through them, through all of us. It's like we only spend time with each other because there is no one else. I know that as soon as they find their perfect friends, they'll leave. The thing is that, I really don't care. It sounds weird, but I wouldn't care if we didn't talk anymore because it is so hard to talk to them about anything at all. You shouldn't have to try in friendships, it should just come easily. I've known these guys since 7th grade, but I knew I never fit in with them. I've never had close, good friends ever, and it gets really frustrating because I can't talk to anyone or laugh or even cry with actual friends. \n\nI'm just really tired of everything going on. I've actually been doing bad in some of my classes. In elementary and jr.high, I was always an A+ student because that was what everyone expected of me. But now, I just don't care and it scares me. I got a D in one of my classes, and my parents still don't know. But, I get these thoughts in my head of if they find out, then what are they possibly going to do? I've never thought of something like that but realizing it, they could take away my room and my clothes and everything. They could abandon me or hit me, but they would never do any of those things, and even if they did, I don't think I would actually care. That is what really scares me, and I can't find a goal or reason in some way as to why I still want to be here right now( I'm not suicidal, just wondering why I'm trying to put on this persona to please everyone else).\n\nI'm sorry for this super long post, and it probably isn't even about loneliness, but I just really needed to let some stuff out.

I live with my dad and his GF, (about to move into a flat with my brothers) and have friends who I see once a week or so aswell as people I talk to at work and all the other usual spatterings of people you see on a day to day basis. \n\nAnd until a few months I was happy with all that. I was so optimistic and even met a girl and even moved into her parents place until we saved up enough to move into our own place. We were both 20 and I was so happy with my life but I started having these days where I woke up and didn't want to get out of bed. I started getting more and more sad for no reason and even started having panic attacks about the world ending and exterstential crisies about how meaningless everything is. \n\nEven though I was happy I wasn't.  \n\nBut my girlfriend made it better. When one day I didn't go to work because I didn't want to get out of bed the next day she set her alarm half hour before mine and woke me up with a cup of tea and we watched Dr who for a little while while cuddling in bed so that I was awake by the time I actually had to get up. When I'd have a panic attack she noticed I stroked my fingers through my hair when I'm stressed and when she did it and hugged me close I genuinly felt like everything would be alright. And when I started to think about how meaningless life was she gave it meaning.\n\nBut I started to become abit too relient on her. It got to the point where she was there for me so often she would want brakes and that pissed me off. Not that she wanted a brake but the times she would do it, I know I was being a dick and I'm not excusing my controlling behaviour but she started doing things that made me feel like I was losing her. She went on holiday without telling me for a weekend when my birthday was on the Saturday, she got a tattoo without even discussing it with me and she would start going to the pub until 11-12 at night every night and ask me to wait up when she knew I had work at 4/5am the next day. \n\nEventually we clashed too much and we broke up. I was devastated but I knew I'd get over it. I hadn't had panic attacks in a few months and she still wanted to be friends and made a point that if I had them again to call her. But it didn't get better and I eventually had to go see a doctor who diagnosed me with depression. I had two weeks off work and half way through the first week my ex calls me crying. Turns out she's pregnant and it's mine.\n\nI knew I was a bad person when the first feeling I had was anger and frustration. Not because we were gonna have a kid, but if she had taken a pregnancy test a few days before we broke up we probably would still be together. I told her the truth, that I still loved her and she told me she didn't love me back. It had only been a month since we broke up but she was seeing someone else but hadn't slept with them yet and so the kid was definetly mine. \n\nThat's when the panic attacks started again. I messaged her and called her but she got annoyed and told me she'd only want to hear from me or talk to me about the kid from now on since when I was trying to call her she was in bed with her new guy.\n\nFast forward to now and I still have all the things I had before, I have work aquatintences I have friends I have a dad who loves me but I still go to bed every night upset. I still message my ex once every few days seeing how she is and she just repkls with a thumbs up emoji. I still get panic attacks and when my dad hears me at night (sometimes get night terrors) he tries to comfort me but it's not the same. I walk around every day and I'm so lonely that I genuinly don't know what to do with myself most of the time. It feels like all I do is work, lie on bed eat shower sleep  repeat and going to bed every night and not having anyone beside me literally kills me. It's like that passenger song 'all the little light' and every time I got to work, every time I realise I've been laid staring at the ceiling for half an hour or every time I go to bed alone a little piece of me does and there's really not that much left at this point.", "subreddit": "lonely"}

Also, this goes without saying, but be sure that I'm FA through and through (as it will become clear later on). I'm 23 and I'm in the last few months of college.\n\nMy crush didn't go to class for over a week (we have class together twice a week), so I decided to ask her on Instagram if she was OK. She also did miss a ton of important stuff for the final test, so later on I also ended up sending her my notes. She was clearly happy I cared about her (I don't remember the last time I saw so many emojis, lol). I ended up telling her I'd be in school on Wednesday if she wanted to study together. She says she wants to and will text me on Wednesday when she's available, after a project meeting.\n\nThis made my week, really. It's the farthest I've ever gotten with someone I'm interested in that didn't involve hanging out with other friends (I've once had a huge crush on someone from my friend group, so we hanged out together all the time \u2013\u00a0it ended nowhere). It should be the first time I hang out *alone* with a crush. Note that this isn't at all a date.\n\nAt first I was ecstatic, but later on I started feeling pathetic. This means absolutely nothing. It's not a date and it's extremely unlikely this will lead to something. We'll see each other in class on Wednesday, the next day on the test and that's it. I can pull some strings with mutual friends to hang out with her later, but theoretically I'm never seeing her again.

I guess that my problem stemmed from social media, before I had that I was blissful and content with my life. I became envious of others watching them show their best selves. I\u2019m starting to learn that people are just people who probably feel the same way as I, they just don\u2019t show it, and my envy comes from me imagining that they live a life without problems as well.

Every since I took a \u201cbreak\u201d from college last year I\u2019ve been at home trying to \u201creform\u201d myself. I was performing poorly and eventually the stress got to me and I crashed. I just couldn\u2019t do it anymore. I took this break to runaway from all that. Ever since then I\u2019ve been afraid to go back. Never told my parents why I needed the break, just said I needed one cuz I wasn\u2019t feeling it. I think my mom saw through me.\n\nI rarely leave the house so I\u2019m basically a shut-in. As a result I have little to no social interactions. I do live with my extended family for reasons but even then I\u2019m starting to feel lonely recently. There\u2019s this uncomfortable feeling in my heart. Like it\u2019s craving something. And it really bothers me. \n\nFor the past year I\u2019ve been gaming to past the time until I need to return to college but that has become uninteresting. So I begun rewatching anime after 2 years of not watching. So far it\u2019s been keeping me occupied. I don\u2019t have any friends. Haven\u2019t had any for almost 2 years. At the beginning of college I made 3. But when that semester ended we never really caught up. \n\nI have some bad habits. Sleeping really late for example. It\u2019s 6:30 am as I\u2019m typing this and I woke up at 4:30 pm yesterday. Haven\u2019t slept since and I won\u2019t be falling asleep for another 2 hours. Been eating very poorly too. Sometimes 1 meal a day most often 2. My dad\u2019s been giving me earfuls for my sleep and my mom for my eating but I\u2019m just not feeling it. \n\nI don\u2019t know if this is the right place for this, but I felt like this is what I needed to get off my chest. Maybe this is what my heart has been craving recently.\n\nI\u2019m not depressed, I\u2019m sure I would know if I was.\n\nI\u2019m pathetic.

Fell in love with my best friend, moved in together and had a couple months of good times with those bad moments in between. Good and bad memories altogether that\u2019ll always be with me. We grew part rapidly and I\u2019ve just felt used. Watching as we got further and further away. She made a friend that needed a new roommate so I asked how serious she was about it since it all happened rather quickly. She was dead set on this offer so I did what I could to help her move everything she had to her new place. \nThis move was for the best especially for her and I\u2019m glad she\u2019s doing better and making her way. \nI told her from the beginning since before she moved in with me that I\u2019d sooner tear myself apart rather than put her out on the street. At the very least I\u2019d just try and be there for support. \nWell I did and will always be there for her if she needs. \nI did offer so I can\u2019t blame anyone for how I feel and I really don\u2019t intend on it. I just need to get this out, to try and free myself from this awful place I\u2019ve found myself in. \nDays before she moved out my depression hit hard, and it just didn\u2019t let up. I kept a smile on my face just to make it. My family keeps asking if I\u2019m okay and I just tell em not to worry because It\u2019s not really important and I don\u2019t worry about how I feel anymore. Well I just don\u2019t know how I feel anymore, I spent a week crying and drinking. Helpful right... I still care a lot about my friend, but I just don\u2019t feel like it\u2019s the same way for her. When we hang out it\u2019s almost like before we crossed that line into a relationship. But It feels like she\u2019s lightyears away out of my reach and life. It fucking hurts and it just won\u2019t stop. \nI try and keep myself occupied with work and my trade school. But it\u2019s just an obligation at this point. When I\u2019m working I loose time In my day because I\u2019m just somewhere else mentally. Most times it\u2019s just quite in my head. Usually I\u2019m thinking about some shit to say to my coworker or focus on doing a good job, but my mind is just blank. When I come home there\u2019s an emptiness that takes over. I tell myself I\u2019ve been through this before many many times before and seems like I just haven\u2019t gotten a break from this cycle. Everything seems less than it is, but every day it crosses my mind to just end it all. I definitely have to means to, and know time schedules so as to not be found for sometime after it\u2019s done. \nBut why do that to people? I know I try and be helpful and that (good guy) but really everybody knows if you see yourself that way your just a piece of shit. And yeah there some truth to that. I want people to hurt as much as I do, that one thing that\u2019s never left my heart since I was little. I fight that feeling as best I can ever since the first time I\u2019ve had that thought. When I thought about it and was being dead serious about it, I felt this black shadow/weight rise behind me that made my hairs stand up. Never looked back and stopped thinking about being hurtful.. \nnow that feeling is back and comes in my dreams. \nI\u2019ve had a reoccurring dream where I\u2019m in a prison and it\u2019s always dark with the only light coming In from cracks In the walls. All I hear is dripping water and the sound of chins. When the guards come to drag me out I can\u2019t see anyone\u2019s face until they bring me into the light of this room. Dropping me in the middle of a circle of people all standing over me. When I look up I see them. These people surrounding me are all parts of me from my past from childhood to present. I\u2019m forced to look at myself though a mirror. As I do so, my reflection stares into my eyes and starts changing its expression. Before I know it I\u2019m paralyzed. As my reflection crawls out of the mirror and is standing over me. He starts choking me and as I\u2019m gasping for air calling for help, the lights start to fade into total darkness. Chains wrap around me and drag me further into the void while my reflection just laughs in echoes. \nThen I wake up in a sweat. \nWalk to my coffee table and pour myself a drink and just stare into my glass wandering back and forth from my glass to my gun. I keep one round right next to it just incase. I can feel something coming, I can see it. I just want to blow my heart out. It\u2019s corrupt and hurting and I don\u2019t know when that day will come when that hammer clips forward and the lights go out forever and I can finally rest. Maybe one more Christmas, one more new year, one more birthday... and then I can disappear.\nI just want this nightmare to end. But there\u2019s still that FUCKING one little bit of resilience, a defiance to prove to myself that I can live with it that I have something to prove to myself if at nothing else there\u2019s no one else left in my life I can let in or hold close. \nI don\u2019t wanna harbor this hate anymore, it\u2019s twisting me and will make me sicker than it most likely already has. I\u2019ll hold myself together, because if there\u2019s anything I can say it\u2019s that I\u2019ll always make it. Guaranteed", "subreddit": "lonely"}

{"post_id": "e1sglt", "created_utc": 1574741146, "title": "I don't know, why am I still single?", "author": "Throwawaydecade31", "self_text": "How is it that everyone close to me is in a relationship, yet I (32M) am not and have never been? Sure, I have my shortcomings and personal issues that I am working on, the same as everyone else (as I am told). But people close to me who have found someone have either the same issues or even worse problems to deal with. These same people have the balls to then tell me things like \"you're just not happy enough\", and \"I can't believe you are still single\", while at the same time giving no practical help when I ask them for it. Are my issues really that much worse?\n\nSometimes I feel like if I did find a girl, people around me wouldn't know who to feel sorry for. Like, they think \"well, my life sucks, but look at him...he's got nothing and nobody. I guess I have something to be thankful for after all. Let's keep him in a place that makes us all feel better about ourselves\".\n\nEdit: Thank you all for the replies. I thought I'd add a bit more in the hopes of fleshing out my post. \n\nI'm a funny, attractive, and at times, charismatic guy. But I do lack self confidence and have social anxiety, which has gotten easier to handle over the last year with therapy and self-help books. I try to go out at least once a week to the bar, even if it's just for a quick beer.\n\nI do not feel entitled to a relationship merely because I want one, nor do I expect a girlfriend to be handed to me on a silver platter. I've been single for the majority of my life and have made it this far. I'd just like to experience a relationship (or attempt one) at this point in my life. I have had flings with girls in the past, so I know I'm not completely incapable of getting close to a girl. The last fling was about 5 years ago.\n\nMy deepest gripe in all of this is my friend's attitude toward something I want. They act surprised I haven't found a girl, yet when I asked for help they said \"no\", and offered half assed words of support like \"you'll find someone someday\". If there's something holding me back from what I want I expect my closest friends to tell me what is wrong so I can work on fixing it. \n\nI haven't been on a real date for almost a year now. I've tried online dating but it doesn't feel comfortable for me yet (never got passed the messaging stage...that's another story). My hope was that my friends would push me in the right direction, help get me out more, and eventually meet new girls. But that hasn't happened thus far.\n\nI guess it just feels like my friends would rather take pity on me rather than help me, as it's easier for them and less work. But I am trying to branch out to new people/friends to expand my circle of support.", "subreddit": "lonely"}

So umm this is just going to be me ranting so it's ok if you don't want to read everything. Ok so I've been single for about... 5 or 6 years now I believe and it has been quite the struggle and adventure. \n\nFirst off the dating scene is terrible. I hate how much of a chore it feels just to meet someone you're attracted to. Even with simple interactions it just takes a lot of energy. Idk if it's because girls don't put effort in communication anymore or I'm just not interested in dating at the moment or I'm scared that I'm not good enough. There are a lot of reasons. I want a relationship and meet someone that I can make spend time and make memories with, but it's so difficult. Ahh well nothing if you also have this problem feel free to share. \n\nI realised that my friends suck as well. They never call or text to see how I'm doing. I only hear from them when they're not feeling well. Honestly I'm tired of dealing with others people stress. It's gotten to the point where I started becoming more honest with them. Bad enough I don't really work well with crying and stuff, but having to hear other people cry puts me in a uncomfortable spot. Not trying to be cole hearted, but the truth has to be told.\n\nNext aside from looking for a partner I've been increasing my skill set. I've taken a hobby in cosplaying and photography. Sadly it's an expensive hobby \ud83d\ude2d I just wish I won 2mil so I wouldn't stress so much, but life isn't always gonna work your so oh well \ud83d\ude01. However I did go to my first con 2 weekends ago and it was amazing. I wish I went by myself though lol. \n\n...What you're still here? Haha well that's awesome.

{"post_id": "e1twkg", "created_utc": 1574749054, "title": "Torn Family, Life Happening, I'd Rather Go through the Motions Alone", "author": "ItsInSpanish", "self_text": "Where do I begin...\n\nCurrently, my parents are going through a divorce, and it's nasty. Years ago, I moved 1000 miles away to start my career in my dream city. But another reason I moved away was to get away from the toxicity of one parent (call that parent A).\n\nGrowing up was not easy. Parent A always made the house tense; anything that would upset them, the smallest thing, would cause outrage. Parent B and my siblings would be walking on eggshells. There was a lot of emotional abuse. Because of that, I would tend to keep to myself because I can't get hurt if I don't open up to anybody.\n\nI was loving my life, and thought I had overcome all that adversity. I gained confidence, and made good friendships for once. Then came the divorce. I tried to stay neutral to both sides, constantly reminding both parents that this fight is between parent A and parent B. Parent B has tried to maintain some form of civility, and has mentioned to me that they do not want to get in between the relationship between Parent A and their children (2 of 3 children are adults).\n\nWell, parent B has decided to go with a scorched earth policy and has been tearing everything apart. Even though I am 1000 miles away, I have begun reliving the emotional abuse from my childhood. I've reverted to my old defense tactic: isolation. Because of what I am reliving, I am becoming increasingly skeptical even of my closest friends because I am afraid of additional hurt, which I know is irrational. But, I go to work, come home, and lay low and would much rather be left alone, because being alone and not opening up further makes me feel safe.\n\nFurther, friendships change because, well, life. Everyone I know is coupled up, getting married, starting families, buying homes, making career moves, moving to different cities. Then there's me. I recognize things change, and no matter how close of friends we are now, I know and understand that one day life will happen. This isolation also helps me in getting ahead of life, that way when friends start a new phase of their lives it will be much easier for me to let go. I hope I won't go missed when that happens.\n\nI do not have anywhere to go for the holidays. I am spending Thanksgiving with my roommate, his family who are staying with us, and friends. If it weren't for us hosting Thanksgiving dinner, I would just stay home. As for Christmas and New Years, I literally have no where to go. I refuse to go to wherever the parents are at, it's too much for me to handle. And I do not want to go to any Christmas celebrations with friends because I will be the awkward 2n+1 wheel. And, that way I avoid pivoting away from the inevitable \"what are you doing for Christmas?\" questions.\n\nMoving away and starting a new life, never had I imagined I would feel ever more alone. Maybe it's the holidays, but it seems like everyone has somewhere to go, and then I am here by choice because it's safe. The place I grew up with is gone, destroyed. I don't belong anywhere, and have no where to be, or to go. I'm just here...\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTL;DR - Parents' divorce has me reliving childhood emotional abuse. Pushing everyone and everything away. My defensive strategy is isolation because that way no one can hurt me. I'd rather be left alone. I don't belong anywhere anymore.

I don\u2019t feel any connections to my friends and I feel like I\u2019m becoming more distant as time goes on. A thing about me is that I have trouble expressing how I feel and opening up to anyone and everyone. I have never talked to anyone about how I\u2019m feeling or the tangled up thoughts and emotions in my head. I always feel like I\u2019m going to be judged by my friends and that they\u2019ll look at me like I\u2019m trying to get attentions by saying I need help and stuff. I\u2019ve noticed that every time I go to school and is around with my friends, I always have a smile on my face, but I still always feel empty even surrounded by friends that I\u2019ve had for a very long time. All I want is to at least have some courage to talk and share to someone about how I feel and express my thoughts. Or at least have some confidence with my actions because every time I zone out thinking about how I\u2019ll tell my friends about the things going on inside my head, I always imagine them thinking that I\u2019m so bothersome and annoying. I think I feel and think this way because I have seen other people at my school, from table mates and glances around in class, judge and talk behind the backs of someone they have some relation to. I don\u2019t want an outcome like this, but then again, I can\u2019t control their actions and choices. I feel like I should already be grateful that I at least have friends, but I also don\u2019t even know what problems I have, it\u2019s just really me being a problem to myself by overthinking everything and not being able to decide on anything.I don\u2019t really know where this is going, all I feel like is that I\u2019m ranting and going on about things I want and not even considering about how people around me might feel.\n\n(Sorry for writing so much on my first post, but if anyone can help me or give me some advice, please say anything. And please don\u2019t judge me on this, it\u2019s my first time writing or even saying how I feel, and I honestly don\u2019t know how to express whatever that\u2019s going on with my head.)", "subreddit": "lonely"}

Is your purpose now to return to the world that disposed of you and become one with the fray, or leave it all behind and start fresh?\n\nFrom the looks of it, many of you are trying desperately to become the vary thing that gave you such pain. You want to become the \u201cnormies\u201d that occupy a life of self ignorance and meaningless luxuries. They may be superficial, but at least they get what they want, what you want, right? Are you not afraid of becoming more corrupt than the ones you conform against? You were left in the dust, and have explored more depth and meaning to togetherness than so many others in the world simply because you have so little of this universal warmth. Never forget the value of this hard lesson, praise the vast perspective you have and use it to navigate your dumbass to true happiness. You all want to live like dolls in a set, a fucking perverted playhouse. \n\nHow many of you thoroughly questioned the condition of your environment, and how many of you truly believe you\u2019re obsolete because you lost your place in this arbitrary game? You are part of a condition that is an unintentional sobering of this synthetic sex party you think everyone\u2019s having without you. Take a big ass step back and control yourself, because nobody else can do it for you. Change the momentum of the direction you\u2019re headed, or get ready for a crash course in the hell that dells at the heart of all of this madness you see before you. \n\nHow the hell are you, by yourself, supposed to know the age and personal qualities you should be to fuck the guts outta some cheeky broad, huh? When were you supposed to get your muff stuffed with a dudes hunk gunk that drools for your junk in the trunk no matter how much it stunk with chick funk? You don\u2019t know who the fuck you are, but you have all the time in the world to. You don\u2019t know that your suffering is coming from you getting played, getting commercialization by that tickle in your pickle. There\u2019s more powerful work to be done at this time, we have a lot more to be responsible for than you give yourself credit for. \n\nFind the fuck out what you\u2019re meant to do now. Get rid of the bullshit. Put your head in the ground and scream it out, find that bastard in you and master that fucker. You young little idiots are a bee\u2019s dick away from kicking the chair out from underneath you and swinging from the ceiling. Let your pain peacefully be known and clear, but let your life leave a trail to find your way home. All you got left is the precipice of truth and lies, you can fuck it all up with one wrong step and become cosmic waste. \n\nDon\u2019t think \u201cfitting in\u201d is going to fix anything, you know too fucking much at this point to act all shallow and helpless about this. Most of you are too far gone to be reached anyways, but for the rest of you, prosper properly and profoundly peacefully no matter what.", "subreddit": "ForeverAlone"}

I'm extremely anxious and shy and I can't talk to people, it's realy hard for me to start a conversation. People in college already know each other for a long time or had met each other during the integration parties . And I never went to one of them.\n\nCan you see the kind of people that always looks upset ?\n\nWell that's me ..For some reason my neutral face looks like someone just told me that they broke my phone. \nAnd I get that people probably don't want to talk to someone who seems like they hate everyone here and that they don't want to speak to anyone.\nAnd I could be thinking about love and cute baby pandas people would still think I'm upset.\nThat's not something that usualy bothers me but to think that it's the only reason why people wont talk to me kinda hurts.\nBecause I always had a nice time with the people I used to talk with and we had a lot of fun.\n\nIn my family my brothers and my parents are all playing Handball except me. And obvioulsy that's the only thing they talk about all days.\n\nSo event when I am with them I end up on my phone or alone because they are talking about sport and they don't even try to change the subjet ONCE in a week.\nAnd when I try to understand what they are talking about they're just like \"it's useless  you don't care about sport\"\n\nAnyway it's not like I'm not used to all this now.", "subreddit": "lonely"}

My world doesn't spin so fast when I'm with her. Everything with her makes sense. We go on adventures and I love that we do everything together and spend as much time as we do. There's so much more. She brings me genuine peace. She sees me as her ultimate protector. She knows she can count on me for anything she ever needs, and knows I would drop what ever I'm doing in a moments notice to be there for anything she needs, big or small, but never takes advantage of that fact. She's told me on more than several occasions she knows I'd be the perfect guy for her and trusts me as much as I do her, indefinitely. It all makes sense with her. I know she would blow off any plans she's made, no matter how far in advance if I told her I needed her, and has proven that she will go to great lengths to take care of me emotionally, though I may be hard pressed to to admit it or ask for help. And knows I would never take advantage of that. \n\nBut all she wants from me is everything you find in a non plutonic relationship, minus romantic intimacy. She's like a puzzle I have every piece for, except that. She doesn't want anything more than my friendship. She wants to be free, to do as she pleases with who she pleases. After a failed attempt at a relationship with someone she was very close with before, and watching that fail and what they had together, including one of the most important friendships she's ever had, go up in flames- she will not risk hurting herself, or more importantly to her, me. She's comfortable in the idea that she can find a guy, and give them that piece of the puzzle that I wake up every day wishing I had more than anything, but if she for no rhyme or reason wakes up and decides she's no longer interested, she can hurt them and drop them just like that and feel no remorse and move on with her day. A safety mechanism for her, as she's suffered from huge emotional relationship trauma. As many of us have.  \n\nI respect her for her honesty and truth and her desire to protect me from her warped sense of love. Shes accepted the love she thinks she deserves, and that love is not the true, genuine, compassionate love that no one ever realizes they deserve without learning the way life works. \n\nSo we will continue to tell each other we love another. We'll continue to spend hours on the couch watching YouTube videos. We'll never stop bending over backwards for one another. We'll plan a ton more adventures and keep making some of the best memories with each other full of laughter, tears, and everything in between. \n\nI'll continue to wish we were more, she'll continue to get what she wants out of many more guys she doesn't need to emotionally invest herself in. I'll continue to watch it happen and stuff down my jealousy and sorrow every time she finds a new flavor of the week to fill the void in her heart she protects me from. \n\nI'll remind myself every day I wake up that I have something more valuable then that last missing puzzle piece. That the fact she honors me with the greatest gift anyone could ever have, the privilege of being the most important person in her life, and that wanting anything more than what I have is selfish on my part. And it'll get easier, tonight is just one of the tougher nights. \n\nAfter all, when you truly love someone, you want to see them happy no matter the cost. No matter how much it hurts. No matter how much I might want more, what really matters is I give her exactly what she wants from me emotionally, and that makes her smile. That's what's important to her. That degree of happiness and her smile is more important than anything else ever could be. \n\nI just wish I wasn't in love with my best friend.", "subreddit": "lonely"}

Why can\u2019t I ever change this feeling?", "author": "throwaway29495739247", "self_text": "Made a throwaway due to the fact that I\u2019m basically about to pour out of my personal life out to which I hardly share with anybody. So here goes\n\nI\u2019ve had this constant feeling of loneliness since around the beginning of freshmen year of high school.  While it does waver sometimes, it feels like I can\u2019t escape this feeling of dread and disappointment. I\u2019ve always had a way of fucking up relationships, with friends or partners, parents, etc. I seem to always set myself up to these absurdly high goals where failure is certain, yet I never seem to learn from my mistakes. I was infatuated with this girl, for whatever reason. I was going steady with this girl at the time, really solid gal, just to try and maybe see where this new oppurtunity would take me. She ignored me, gave really bland responses to texts yadayadayada.  Not sure why but I kept trying and trying to make this shit work, using excuses like \u201cmaybe she\u2019s busy\u201d when she wouldn\u2019t responded when it was obvious I was being ignored. It\u2019s the worst feeling, when you like somebody so much and if you disappeared they wouldn\u2019t even give a shit. So I just broke a perfect girls heart, for no other reason than me wanting to switch things up. Around this time my step dad dislocated his shoulder when I was around 16, and he was prescribed oxycodone. With my depression growing deeper, and I\u2019ve heard pain meds can get you high, I took some. Took 2, nothing. Took 2 more, nothing. The next day I took 6 and I was just wrapped in this warm feeling, like a blanket that just erased every single worry and doubt from your head, and let you finally have peace. This cycle continued for a couple weeks, and when his script ran dry, I\u2019d switch to looking for anything I could take to just escape this feeling of loneliness swelling inside my body. At the end of sophomore year, I met a girl at a friends place one day, and it was pretty much instant attraction on both ends. She pursued me, which was absolutely perfect for a shy lad like myself. We ended up dating at the beginning of summer and things were going great. You\u2019d think after I made such a stupid mistake beforehand, I would have learned my lesson, right? Nope; not in the slightest. Same exact thing happened again, another woman crossed my path and I threw everything else to the side, pursuing a woman who doesn\u2019t give a shit about me. I\u2019d go into detail, but it\u2019s the same thing as what I previously described above. After that it\u2019s been silent for me, I haven\u2019t really tried to get out there, and maybe find someone who cares about me as much as I\u2019d care about them. Maybe it\u2019s like that one song, once bitten twice shy. Anyways here we are in present times. I\u2019m nearly 18, have some pretty decent friends, I\u2019m good with my parents, I have a car and a really solid job. But why do I not like looking at myself in the mirror? Why do I go to sleep with this feeling that I\u2019m alone? Why won\u2019t this constant agony subside? I\u2019ve never felt worse when one would think I\u2019d be feeling pretty good. I jsut want to be able to call someone mine, someone to think about, someone to feel. If you\u2019ve made it this far I really appreciate you reading this, it means a lot. If anyone has a clue of how to escape this mindset, this mentality, hell, this curse, please let me know how to do so.", "subreddit": "lonely"}

So I did what most do, worked super hard to get good grades to make sure I'd never have to see those assholes again, and now I attend university in a big city (the capital to be specific). During high school, I hung around a shit group of people (the majority of whom I was very close with in elementary school) who overall treated me like shit, talked about and made fun of me behind my back, excluded me from literally everything and anything they could, and were just flat out mean. \n\nJust to give you an idea of the kinds of individuals they were, I had one \"best friend\" who in the 10th grade, asked to meet up with me in a park adjacent from our school, where she then set me up, brought along one of her friends who absolutely hated me, physically held me down and beat the living shit out of me while I was left defenceless. Another \"best friend\" messaged my sexual assaulter (boyfriend of the one girl who was brought along in the previous sentence) on Facebook and for whatever reason told him I lied about the entire assault (unfortunately I still remained her friend even after I found out about that). There's so many more stories like that, but some of them are just too traumatizing to even bring up. \n\nSo you can understand now why in the last 2 months of high school, I decided enough was enough, and sent an online message to some of those friends, explaining why and how they hurt me and how I no longer wanted anything to do with them, proceeding to block them completely just so I could have the last word (god knows anything they would've written after that would've just been lies upon lies). It's been about 6 months now since I've done that, and honestly the loneliness/hatred for them and myself is slowly eating away at me. The thoughts never go away, the memories of how fucking stupid I was to put up with such horrible treatment/abuse are constantly in my mind and I wish I could just be at peace. After all, that's why I left my hometown, to get away from those constant reminders of what I went through for 4, almost 5 years. The thoughts just seem to follow me wherever I go. \n\nI've thought about killing myself so many times just so I won't have to think about it anymore, but what good will that do? That means that they win and I lose. I can't let that happen. I can't do that to my family. Everyone I know from my counsellor back home to my parents/brother has told me to just \"forget about it and move on\", but I fucking can't and I don't know why. I think what bothers me the most about it all is that they don't even feel bad about it. I know for a fact they think they are in the right and that I'm just a whiney cunt who expected too much. I guess that's what happens when you use that many drugs at such a young age. Oh yeah, did I forget to mention that too? Cocaine, xanax, molly, you name it, they're doing it (something I unfortunately got into for a few months as well but thankfully got the hell out of. Them, not so much). Anyway, where was I? Oh ya, any helpful tips/similar experiences you guys have to share would be much appreciated, as I'm kinda struggling a lot right now with this if you couldn't tell. Thank you so much!!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTL;DR shitty small town, got bullied all the time, left small town for better things. Hung out with shitty garbage friends at the time, cut them all off before leaving shitty small town but now lowkey traumatized as result of shitty behaviour.

I think I only got the strength to break up with my first ex because of him. \n\nBecause I was coming from a place of so much pain, he took advantage of that and love bombed the hell out of me. \n\nHe told me I was the prettiest girl he\u2019d ever met (most guys say I\u2019m a 7/10), really treated me like it to. I blocked him on everything and he wrote me a letter. He spent hundreds of dollars on me that I knew he didn\u2019t have. He complimented me every day, talked to me every day, always took care of me... \n\nHe made me feel beyond special- he was the only person I felt like understood me, loved me, wanted me around. And his family made me feel this way too. \n\nI always felt like we were connected- even when we were fighting- we were working under the same tendencies and patterns. Something I felt like nobody had like me, nobody was that decent. \n\nHe was my other half. \n\nI had got to know his whole family and all his siblings (a family of 6) and I was basically like a daughter to his parents. I took care of his younger siblings too and was very involved with his life and the whole family\u2019s lives. \n\nWhen we broke up, it didn\u2019t even feel real. He never told me why, but he kept me around for about a month. He said he loved me, he still wanted me around, but he didn\u2019t want me as a girlfriend anymore. I couldn\u2019t take it, I felt so far away from him, it just built into rage. He finally gave up on me. \n\nI was so enraged that I cursed him out, I said the meanest things I\u2019ve ever said to anyone- \u201care you crying? I hope you are. I hope you hurt as much as you fucking hurt me. You\u2019re a piece of shit. You\u2019re a monster.\u201d I ended the relationship, and he has my phone number but hasn\u2019t done anything to show that he wants me back, understandably. \n\nThere\u2019s a certain way a guy talks to you when he hurts. It\u2019s just a voice that\u2019s given up, a voice that tells the truth it doesn\u2019t want to, a voice that cares about you but can\u2019t stand you any longer. And I hate to hear it. I want to be with someone who wants me, but I want him. \n\nHe wants nothing to do with me, but to me he\u2019s still my baby. It\u2019s been months and I still think about him with happiness, missing him, loving him. I knew even if I got to talk to him, it wouldn\u2019t be the same, and I\u2019d just be crushed because he doesn\u2019t want me anymore. I accidentally described him as my boyfriend at work the other night, and I immediately felt so disgusting and sad. \n\nSometimes it\u2019s easier to just lie and say he is my boyfriend to tell a story. Sometimes it\u2019s easier to think of him as my boyfriend because I don\u2019t have to deal with the mental conflict of reality and my memories. It\u2019s just so hard to feel different when I rarely even saw him or talked to him towards the end, maybe once a week. I used to have to wake up every morning and remember that he isn\u2019t my boyfriend. \nI still have to remind myself but these memories and these feelings won\u2019t go away. I hate it. \n\n*nsfw trigger warning* \nI can\u2019t even touch myself without thinking about him or wanting him. It\u2019s been several months. I don\u2019t want to be with other people, I don\u2019t want to date, I don\u2019t have crushes, my body doesn\u2019t want other people. It wants him. I\u2019ve been in nonconsensual situations with other people, and my body tenses in a certain way. I can\u2019t enjoy anything sexual because my body won\u2019t let me, and my mind half way doesn\u2019t even want to. My body and mind go off with warning that I am my ex-boyfriend\u2019s still, that I need to save myself for him. He was the only person I\u2019ve ever trusted or enjoyed sexually. I can\u2019t imagine sex with anyone else, not even previous crushes or celebrity crushes or anything. All I want is him. I hate it. \n\n*nsfw over* \n\nThe relationship is over and will never be the same. I can\u2019t stop loving him, wanting him, thinking about him as my boyfriend.

She was my first real love, and my first serious relationship. She was actually my first everything. Well, I've had relationships before but not like this. I know it takes time to get over someone, I've heard before that its double the amount you've been with the person but I'm sure it depends on the person. \nDuring the relationship I felt like I was always being taken for granted and I wasn't being understood. I was so certain that my girlfriend was such a mean person, I've since come to realize that she wasn't bad at all, we just didnt know how to speak to each other in our different love languages. We went through our rollercoaster, bickering a lot over nothing because we took it personally but it was worth it when we could make it work. When it was good it was great, we were a team. I was so immature and naive about everything, I didnt even try to understand or appreciate anything, not just my ex girlfriend. I was so closed minded, I didnt even bother with making change. At that time I was sticking with my old ways that I learned rocking onto.\nWhen we broke up I felt horrible like I let go too soon, and that I made a mistake. I continued to live my life trying to make myself believe it was for the best for me.\n\n Snce then I've went on a journey to find out who I am.\nI told myself that I wouldn't turn to any substances before I knew I was ready because I didnt want to grow dependent and I wanted to face my emotions head on. \nWhen I felt felt ready I got high with my roommate at the time. I had a bad trip and ended up having this existential dream or vision or something and it completely changed my views on everything including myself. I realized that I was the one that was mostly messed up. Though, she want perfect, if I even tried it could have worked. \n\nAfter about half way through the break up, a girl from work was interested in me and made it clearly obvious. I didn't want to get into something so soon because I was still hurting but I knew I would regret it if I didnt at least try. So after a month of dating she ends up ending things with me because she didnt feel anything towards me anymore. It's fine, it didnt really hurt because I knew it wasn't going to be anything serious. I think she was using me for support \n\nI never stopped thinking about my ex though and even now it affects me. I want to reach out but nothing's changed in my life other than my thought process. I have a new job as an MLO but I haven't been making any money yet. I want to show her and more importantly myself that I'm dedicated now and I'll be successful. \nI want to be better for me but also for her, in the Hope's that one day we can be together again.\n\nI just dont know if I feel this way because I'm lonely, or if it's because I really do miss her and I want to be with her. I know she was my first with a lot of things and I dont have a lot of experience with dating and that can make it seem like shes more worth it than she is but I really dont know. I know that the way I am now, and the way I'm going I can make it work with her and we can be happy together but maybe that's just the daydreams of a delusion person, but I know shes probably not the same person she was before either.

He is slightly autistic and has always had behavioral problems, lashing out at people is just one thing he does..\n\nMy daughter has also been playing up at night since I left which im getting the blame for, my opinion is she just misses me AND she is also just getting over an ear infection and no child goes back to being 100% after being ill.\n\nIve never been able to cope very well without the family we created and im happiest when I'm around them.

We spoke almost every day of the week for nearly the entire year before hand. Whilst at 16 I can't say I was in love or anything, I knew for a fact that was the closest I'd been so far. We'd make each other laugh and flirted all the time without realising. We got along really well and always enjoyed being around each other, even when I was a little quiet or nervous.\n\nWe spoke in a group chat outside of school daily but never really directly. We became good friends over that year going to movies and other things together in that group. My life didn't revolve around her but she was important to me. I loved being with her and whenever I wasn't I looked forward to the next time I could be. \n\nI was always afraid to ask her out. I was friends with one of her close friends who whenever I asked about the crush sent screenshots of messages saying she wasn't interested in me. Whilst she showed all the signs she liked me, I decided to not tell her how I felt and still have someone to look forward to seeing rather than someone who rejected me.\n\n I remember the last day of high school, watching her drive away in her parents van. I knew I'd probably never see her again and I still remember that feeling of failure. \n\nDuring the summer holidays we had to go to college for an hour or two to confirm our places. For the most part she was nearby (I would have spoke to her but I was with my mum which wide make it awkward). I overheard her say how she was eager to talk to some guy who I hadn't heard of and that she liked him. I knew then that even if she did like me at one point, she's moved on. I wanted to burst out in tears but I couldn't.\n\nNow we're at college and I've only seen her once, on the second day there. We only spoke briefly. I still think about her often and how I messed up my chances. I just can't move on. I know just how much I want to. I know talking to another girl might help but there aren't any, not one.

When I was in elementary school my family moved a lot. Never to a different state but different cities. In kindergarten I wasn\u2019t friends with anyone ( at least from what I can remember) and after third grade my family moved to a different city. At this new school (4th grader now) I had two solid friends. And it was good from what I remember. We were close and always cracked jokes. Then my family moved again. But not to a different city but to a different district. At this new school I was bullied more often and didn\u2019t really click with anyone. But I went to an after school daycare located on the schools grounds and made some friends. I made two solid friendships during my time there (one boy and one girl).  But we were all friends only during this after school thing, when it was during the regular school session they both went off with there friends and I was left alone. I would table hop here and there but I was never truly accepted. Then I went to middle school. During this time my family still moved but never out of the district, only in different areas of the region. In middle school I can\u2019t name one person who I was really close with, who I felt I could open up to and be friends for life (ik it sounds cliche but still it\u2019s how I feel).

Me and that kid were close at one point but he started getting into league of legends and everytime I would ask him to go outside and play basketball he would say no. At a certain point I realized that I couldn\u2019t be friends with anymore bc I felt so mistreated.  Always a no always feeling rejected and an afterthought. And from middle school to high school I\u2019ve always been that background character. An afterthought. I hate this feeling. It\u2019s anger and sadness and hopelessness just constantly building within me. Only being released in small spurts when I go and talk to my therapist. In high school I played football and quit after 2 and a half  years bc I got bullied so much. It caused a lot of problems in my family, it was pretty much the spark that lit the fire. I was angry after practice bc I never was able to tell those fucking bullies to go fuck themselves. And the coaches weren\u2019t any fucking help they were just fat fucks who only cared about the super stars on the team. My anger at them became misdirected towards my family. Cops got called on me twice for domestic disturbances both times they were called my own family. After I quit I isolated myself from everyone. But nobody ever cared anyways so. After that I ate lunch in the bathroom stall of my schools bathroom. And would search every bldg for an empty open room to sit at so that no one would see me alone. I felt so embarrassed. My senior year I had to find a group so that my family wouldn\u2019t see what it was truly like. I needed to fake it so that I didn\u2019t feel like I disappointed them so that I wouldn\u2019t look like a loser and a loner. But they probably already knew. I\u2019ve been going to therapy for four years now. Sometimes though since I\u2019m in college I\u2019ll go long periods of time (4-5 months) without talking to my therapist. I\u2019m lonely and sad and angry at myself for being this way and angry at the world for being so shitty and cruel. I\u2019m so close to losing hope guys. And that\u2019s all I\u2019ve had to keep me going. I\u2019m crying writing this bc it hurts so bad. The only person I met in college (one of my two roommates) that I felt was a good friend and a person who I could see myself being close with for years to come is dead. He passed away from a drug overdose. And I miss him and I hate making it about me when I say this but now I truly have nobody. Things with my family have gotten loads better but it\u2019ll never be fully healed imo. I can\u2019t see a future where I am not alone it just gets darker and darker. I\u2019ve become more cynical. I\u2019m reaching out for help and advice. If some of you have been in a situation like mine and came out of it with lifelong friendships please share with me your stories and advice on how you did it. I\u2019m sorry if what I wrote seems choppy I am writing this while in my feeling. I overthink a lot and all the time and when I write it\u2019s the worst so when I am in my feelings or trying to write what I am thinking I just keep writing and I rarely stop bc I just want to get the raw emotion out and articulate it as true to the actual feeling without overthinking. I\u2019m sorry for the typos and the vagueness of it all. If I had all the time to write it all out in a more detailed way I would but for now I can only provide what I think are the most important parts of what I am feeling and thinking.

He walked me back to a taxi where i mentally prepared myself for him to try go home with me and to my pleasant surprise he didnt, he just kissed me and said he wanted to see me again and even text me that night to see if i got home ok.\n\nAfter that he text me literally all the time and we met a week later again, then he asked to meet me a few days after that date and at this point we literally got on so well, had the best laugh so much in common and he was a gentleman. After the third date, i invited him back and we smoked a few joints. Things got heated, now we were both pretty fucked and did bits but i ended up falling asleep. The next morning was very cute and i felt happy with the situation.\n\nWe met again a few days later and he came back to mine again, this time we were sober and had a nice time but things got heated and we were making out for AGES as in to the point where i was like, is he gona take it further or what haha. So i took the lead and did all the work which he seemed happy to let me do, then graphic, i asked him to switch and he literally went for a few mins and seemed to be getting tired and apologised that hed no stamina etc. At this point i presumed he was lazy and the time of guy who let the girls do all the work and it also crossed my mind that he was inexperienced because he didnt take any control and going back to the first kiss how gentle he was etc.\n\nAfter this nothing changed we still text all the time had a great time together, i didnt have doubts even though we were just casual i was happy with how things were going and i had no doubt he felt the same. He came over again a few days later and said he missed me, that the last few days were so boring how he couldnt wait to see me cause we get on so well and he doesnt have as much fun with anyone else. That night the sex thing happened again, just kissing for ages and grinding and i had to initiate and do all the work again and i was getting pretty frustrated so i asked him when we were going to sleep if he was comfortable having sex with me and he seemed so confused by the question and said of course he was etc, so i said id leave it go and hope for the best. That night he also made a comment about his ex, who he said had started going out with a friend of his and it felt a lil strange but i didnt care too much we were casual and everyone has a similar situation\n\nAgain we were still good after that, we even planned a weekend away but he asked to come see me before it which i was more then happy with. So he came over everything was perfect, being very cuddly with eachother, i felt very happy and think he did too. Things got heated again and i was determined this time to make it work but the same thing happened again and i ended up stopping half way and confronting him. Now the details of the order of the conversation are all a bit muddled, but he said he didnt know what was going on.\n\nThen he said it could be his ex that hes a bit bothered about it, and that also he didnt know when it was okay to initiate things with me and wanted to be a gentleman cause before he initiated things with a girl and it didnt go well so now hes extra careful, but i called bullshit on that because i literally couldnt of given him more signs and it still didnt dismiss the fact that he didnt take control etc\n\nHe kept saying he didnt know why he was like that and i asked was he a virgin and he said no, and he seemed very confused and a little nervous he kept saying he didnt know what to say and he didnt know why, so i asked the most embarrassing question a girl could ask, was he sexually attracted to me\n\nHe said of course he was etc that he was just shy but i wasnt satisfied and kept pushing him and saying its okay if he wasnt and to just be honest and then he said 'maybe i am maybe i amnt sexually attracted to you i dont know im confused i mean how can i not be, look at you, youre so sexy\" and that this stage i was super annoyed and just asked him to be honest and he said that he wasnt attracted he wasnt sure after last time if he liked me and wanted to see how tonight went and that he had considered cancelling the weekend away\n\nSo i was devastated and annoyed with all the lies and shocked because until i confronted him about the sex he didnt show any signs that he wasnt attracted to me or that he didnt like me. He couldnt go home because he had a few beers in his system so he had to stay which was awkward. We talked a bit and he said he was so sorry and he was still confused looking and worried, and when we layed down to sleep...he cuddled into me and sighed and said he still liked me?!\n\nAt this stage i was just brain fried and upset he clearly didnt know what he wanted and i said that to him and he said he did that he wanted me that hes so happy around me always thinks about me that he was just looking for something to say when i confronted him about the sex stuff that he didnt know why he said it, that it was all lies and bullshit and that he cant explain why he said it but that hed never hurt me again he was just nervous and then he said that he didnt have experience with girls that hes only been with 2/3 girls and that he was afraid he wouldnt perform and disappoint me and that thats why he had thought about cancelling the weekend because he thought i wouldnt be happy etc.\n\nHe said hes over the moon were together that hes just shy and doesnt know why he said it etc and i am just so confused and insecure about the situation. I want to give him another chance and believe he didnt mean it because i am shocked by him saying it, as he never gave any signs that he wasnt attracted or didnt like me and as i said earlier i had just presumed he was inexperienced.\n\nBut then at the end of the day he did say those things there must be some truth to it? Hes begging me for another chance and i just really dont know what to do im really hurt and upset and need opinions", "subreddit": "lonely"}

I make plans with people, hang out with them, but I don't feel the need to constantly be hanging out with people all the time. However, this all changed when this girl, let's call her Amy came into my life. We grew really close, she was going through a tough time and I had just broken up with an emotionally abusive ex and we were just there for each other. She would want to hang out everyday and call me multiple times a day. It was kind of annoying at first but slowly I got used to it. two years into being friends, we had an addition to the friend group, let's call the third one Matt. The three of us were inseparable. We are all in college and we're all very busy but we hung out whenever we were free. Matt had recently proposed to his fiance and she became a core part of the friend group too. She would hang out with us from time to time as well. \n\nThings were okay for about a year, but fast forward to about a year ago, Amy started acting a little off. I could see that she was upset at me but she never brought anything up. I chalked it up to just me being anxious, esp. since things went back to being the way they were before. She had said that she felt like she was forcing this friendship because she was always the one making plans but that was just the dynamic of the group. I apologized to her and tried to make more of an effort despite my personality. a couple months after that, i started dating someone and he is the sweetest, kindest, most sociable person ever. He made an effort to get to know my friends and Matt and his fiance LOVE him. Amy seemed to like him too and they got along well. She did say something that was a little weird though. She said, \"you are going to have a second boyfriend in the three years I've known you and I am going to stay single forever.\"  She's never had a serious boyfriend but she had been texting this very toxic guy and we all disliked him and tried to tell her that he sucked. (turns out she was seeing him behind our backs even though we wouldn't have like done anything? we just didn't like him.) \n\nAnyway, we didn't stay in touch over summer due to being very busy. We came back to school and she was very off. I tried to talk to her, in tears, asking her if I had made a mistake and if there's any way I could fix it. She told me that it was just her going through some stuff. \n\nMe and Matt continued to try and make plans but she never could hang out anymore. a few months ago she sent us a text saying she felt like she was fifth wheeling and very depressed and did not want to be around couples due to her own feelings for the toxic guy. It was confusing but I guess I understand. I never blew her off to hang out with my boyfriend. I just could not spontaneously hang out with her as much anymore. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnyway, I've been feeling so lonely ever since we \"broke up.\" It wasn't a big thing, tbh. It happened gradually.  She is still nice when I see her and will occasionally ask me to go out with her but I don't want to just be her friend when she is drunk. I feel so lonely now because I was so used to her being around. I spent so much of my time with her that I did not really give enough time to other friends. Now I feel so lonely even if I have my boyfriend and I hang out with my other friends. I cannot take this sadness away. What do I do? How do I get out of this? I feel like I have no friends. I don't want to rekindle anything with her because I am hurt. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTLDR: a friend and I drifted apart partially because everyone in the friend group was seeing someone and she wasn't, she was the closest friend I had and now I feel lonely. How do I get over this sadness?", "subreddit": "lonely"}

I would always label it as social anxiety but at this point talking to this one girl online made it pretty obvious. I can't even talk to a girl for 5 minutes without her ghosting me. (I know because she left me on read) It was a girl that my landlord's son introduced to me online. I didn't particularly find her attractive but who am I to be picky right now and I genuinely don't mind making new friends, boy or girl. We were talking and it was going fine, so I thought but then she left me on read on Facebook. I thought to myself, maybe she got busy or something, nope. She gets back on shortly after and goes offline again. Looking back, when she would ask questions about me, I'd answer. Then she'd talk about herself and her situation and I'd still talk about myself and not acknowledge what she just said. I'm such a fucking idiot. I'm not a narcissist or anything but this is why I believe I'm autistic at this point. I feel like my social ques are just completely gone at this point. How can I possibly be in a relationship when I can't even go 5 minutes without scaring or annoying them away? The worst part is, when I sent her a selfie of me, she went \"aww\" and I know some guys on here don't even get that but does it even matter if I reach second base if the result is all the same? I was never a mAc dAdDy KiLlEr but I was never this bad. This is actually scaring me.

Monika ruined something that could of been amazing. Now here's the thing: me and Maddie saved Monika from a lonely life. Nobody else would be friends with here, so me and Maddie stepped in. Me and Monika were friends for a while, but when she saw that I was close friends with Maddie, she hated me. So Monika?

Love, employment, social life. Things the bullied little loser freshman I had been at the beginning of high school wouldn't have thought possible. From 17 to 22, I was riding high. I was one of 2 people in my friend circle who had a life of love and child to dote on. \n\nThen, as if God thought I needed a reminder of where I came from, everything came crashing down. The love was gone. I had to fight tooth and nail for my kid. I wasn't able to re-enlist at the end of my term (turns out the Army doesn't particularly care for single parents). Then came the years of solitude. I never did well socially. I've done as well back on the dating scene as a one legged man in an ass kicking contest. Really it was pure luck I had what I had in the first place. 6 years. It really feels like it has been both longer and not so long since we were talking about marriage, taking family photos, or planning family holidays. \n\nThen, as if to add insult to injury, everyone I know and consider close has partnered up in the last couple years. From my friend that we all figured would be a life long bachelor akin to a redneck Sterling Archer, to even my little brother who for the longest time we all thought was gay (and he even played along with the jabs and jokes, to a scary degree). Everyone I know has someone to spend the holidays in the loving arms of. And this being the year my ex gets our daughter for holidays, I don't even have that little bit of comfort to rely on. \n\nSo, here I am, 2 years shy of 30. Alone. Miserable. But due to circumstance, forced to fake that smile, and pretend I'm alright, that I'm \"just fine thank you for asking\".

{"post_id": "e3iauy", "created_utc": 1575050834, "title": "What is currently working for me, pick and choose what may work for you (24M, very long post)", "author": "King_of_Zembla", "self_text": "**Long Post.** I was happily FA for a long time, I always had loose acquaintances and 2 high school friends that I kept in touch with for years but ultimately traipsed around for years throughout college and careers always just keeping to myself and not feeling the need for people or socialization beyond work. For the longest time I was just numb to it, then at about 22 the bottom sort of fell out and I fell into a crippling depression. I did some interesting things but ultimately as an FA wasted my youth, became very depressed for about a 1 year period, and then became paralyzingly suicidal for about 6 months to the point where I had to quit my job and move back home for about 2 months. I, in the last 6 months , I have made a concerted effort to start socializing, becoming close with people, meet a partner and have rebuilt a life that is far more fulfilling albeit not without its fair share of disappointments. I have made a lot of adjustments and received a lot of support over the last 6 months and this has yielded a life (involving a lot of fun dating experiences, new friendships, a mid-term relationship) that I can continue living which I could not say about my life over the last 18 months and I want to share them in case it helps anyone. **This subreddit always seems to shit on suggestions, please don't find excuses as to why you cant do something, just pick and choose what may work for you.** Also, if you're young, please don't think you can be FA forever and be happy. if you read through psychological literature you find that disorders that lead to FA like Schizoid or Avoidant personality disorder typically have the lowest psychological functioning of any personality disorder. Humans need people, like Hume said, there is no way of conceiving of a human being without them being with other people as human beings have only ever existed (in the longterm) in the presence of other people.\n\n**Foundational principles of FA (or at least my general observations on FA)**\n\n1) It's been said before, but I like to think of FA as like having a broken leg. There are a lot of different ways one can break their leg and there are degrees to the injury. There's no one way to break a leg, some people have hairline fractures while others have their femurs shattered, but ultimately everyone has the same pain and its a shame when no one helps them with it.\n\n2) Even if we are all here for different reasons, we all pretty much share traits of high inhibition, people not being entirely comfortable around us, and the fact that we were conditioned to not really expect much from people and thus kind of forge ahead with creating a fulfilling life without the help of people. For the vast majority of us this is a losing battle, hence why we are here.\n\n3) This is a disease that should be partially attributed to the culture. Most cultures prior to the Industrial Revolution prioritized social capital and stratification over material considerations which led to much closer knit communities and a focus on connection (many cultures involving feasts or celebration would purposefully and ceremonially destroy property with the objective of making people more reliant on eachother for survival).  People in these cultures would instill values of socialization and often meddle in the social lives of their children to make sure everyone was connected in some sense. Today our culture is more atomized, so if your nuclear family or other close people in your live didn't make an effort to mitigate the damage of your high inhibition or low self worth (as they might have done if your issue was say drug addiction and poor grades in school) , then it becomes much easier to fall into the worst of FA-dom. The reality is on a bell curve most of us are probably not worse than the bottom quartile of inhibition or attractiveness, but people in our lives did not encourage or make a safe space for us to make connections with people which warped our sense of ourselves in relation to other people. Many other people with our same traits did get this luxury and never went through an FA period because of it, we kind of have to make this for ourselves from scratch.\n\n4) We all still have fulfilling experiences without people and anyone who says you cant have fulfilling experiences while being alone can eat a dick, but, in the long-term, it is impossible (not difficult, but impossible) to have a fulfilling life without some basic support structure. Some people can have a fulfilling life without sex, an barely registering minority of people can live a fulfilling life without any physical touch from people, but you would have to be a complete psychopath to be able to live a fulfilling life without anyone in your life or at least the promise of people who you can come back to if you decide to live a couple years out as a peaceful hermit. The secret to people who can find happiness alone is that they do so with the intent of eventually coming back to other people.\n\n**Whats working for me**\n\n1) Make socializing and connecting fun for yourself. I was an econ major so I like to think of things in terms of cost vs utility. The reason for most of FA-dom is the fact that the utility we received from socializing rarely outweighed the costs that it put on us. The way to fix this is to increase the utility you receive from socialization. Say jokes that you find funny, create interactions that are enjoyable for you, If you go on a date suggest a place that you will like. The emotional/financial costs of going on a date that turns out bad will be high than the benefits I received but if I also get some amazing crepes and a fun story out of the bad date then it brings to cost/benefit back to equilibrium. If I'm on a dating app, I don't immediately start with things that I think will draw people in; rather I start with a wide net and just say things that I find entertaining because it makes it an enjoyable activity and decreases the feeling of burnout. Eventually you will build up enough good interactions that socialization itself will be enjoyable, but you just have to prime the pump until that day arrives\n\n2) Spend money if you have it. Get a good hair but, find nice clothes, get a smart phone, take fitness classes, get therapy. I was always crazy frugal growing up and also thought it was better to focus on developing yourself as a person rather than being hyper focused on material goods and your appearance. I shopped for cheap clothes, had a flip phone, cut my own hair (started to get good at it towards the end), only worked out at home all in the hopes that my *brilliant personality* would make up for the difference. It did not. Just make yourself look good, think of yourself as being worth looking good. Don't overthink how doing so reflects on your value system, Gautama did not live in a time with iPhones.\n\n3) Just be less inhibited even if it means being awkward and unenjoyable. Ask people out that you barely know, pull teeth to get a conversation going, \n\n4) **Realize that your presence is valuable to people** and that there are a lot of people who are in some way lonely or going through a hard time and that just your support or empathy or acknowledgements alone can make their lives better. Being FA for so long and being so close to suicide for so long as a result of it, you start to realize that other people are also in the same state where just a hug or a smile or an acknowledgement of whatever their situation is would also help them. Young, old, male female, all relationships are worth cultivating because they make both people stronger, feel free to just use your presence to make peoples lives better, most of the time you will be rewarded for it. (Cheesy Steely dan quote time? \" Love your mama, love your brother  Love 'em till they run for cover\"...oh? so, not Steely Dan quote time? sorry)\n\n5) Treat dating and socialization like a game. I was always turned off by the idea of dating because it always seemed like game or like applying for jobs. I hated the idea that something meant to be intimate had to start off as something you sort of manipulated. But as soon as I treated it like a numbers game it worked, the intimacy can come later.\n\n6) Learn good conversation skills (dont focus on being interesting, just focus on improving the flow and payoffs of conversation) Asking questions, giving acknowledgment statements, soliciting people's opinions or advice, complimenting people, giving positive reinforcement. We've all had the feeling when we see someone with a lot of friends who we wonder like \"how is this kind of boring kind of douchey guy getting so many people to like clamor for their attention\". Usually they are doing 3 or 4 of the above listed things on top of whatever makes them attractive to others.\n\n7) Most importantly, use what's already going your way as a starting point. I had a few tthings going for me all along, I just kind of fell for the toolbox fallacy where I had 8 of the 10 things I felt I needed, but held off on socializing and interacting until I had the other 2 (I never got the other 2, just forged ahead with what I had knowing no one is perfect). I have always been like a 6 who could gussy up to a 7 on a bell curve, I've always been thin (too thin for most of my life like 5'11\" and 110lbs when I started college while lifting weights and eating 3000 calories a day, but as I've gotten older I've filled out), I have a college degree, I'm considered relatively funny by 90% of the people I've met and did Stand up comedy at a low level for a while, and I used my FA-dom to save a decent amount of money, read a lot of books and ultimately cultivate my interests. I leveraged these things to my benefit which has made the transition easier. If you have trouble locating things that are good about yourself (this subreddit is not a treasure trove of self-worth), literally ask people to tell you what is good about you (obviously in a roundabout way, or directly and just make a joke about it)\n\n**What this looked like for me**\n\nSo, what triggered me to change was I took a new job in Iowa which was 2000 miles from the nearest family member of mine (all of whom live WA/OR). I fell into a paralyzing depression that made it hard for me to go 15 minutes without wanting to kill myself. I was cutting myself, I would feign hanging myself I spent the entirety of my day crying at my job or at home (I was in a cubicle alone and could produce and cry at the same time), I intentionally crashed my car at 40 mph and survived with like a concussion (it was going faster then I slowed down but not in time lol). I was depressed for as long as I can remember but when I got suicidal I could used just take a walk, smoke weed, or play a video game and the suicidal thoughts would eventually fade. These things no longer worked I no longer had a respite and was in a near crisis 24 hours a day. While I was in IA, just to mitigate the loneliness I joined a gym and asked out a barista who I had just met that day by specifically saying \"I know we don't know eachother, but I'm new in town and am just crazy lonely\" (the gym sucked, the the barista relationship was good, we still text to this day). For the first time in my life I opened up to my parents about how suicidal I was (my parents and I aren't that close, they were pretty egregious alcoholics and never really were involved in my life, they dont fully remember where I went to college, what my major was, what I do for a living, or other basic trivia about me, but they still care for me). I then drove home, started therapy (you can get cheap talk therapy for like $60-100 a session), started following the above listed advice, joined a yoga class, started a new job at a lower pay that involved a lot more social interaction, moved into a Craigslist home with 5 people in it, and reconnected with family i had lost touch with. I started dating (which was easier because I consider myself bi-sexual, if bi is 50M/50F, i'm like 30M/70F, but guys are way easier to date then women) and have thankfully always at least had a 2nd date and never actually been rejected in person. I exhaustively curated a dating app profile on like 5 platforms (which was harder because I didnt have a smart phone until June and had no pictures of myself since freshman year of college that was not on an ID badge). I also layered a lot of people, so linking together 2 or 3 uncommitted relationships so that I would have someone else if one of them falls through. I then met someone who I have been steady with for a few months. There are definitely disappointments (ie, my current partner honestly is not someone who I am very attracted to and her antidepressants absolutely demolish her sex drive), but it is all better than the alternatives.\n\nLast thoughts, just because I couldnt find a clean way to include them with the rest of my ramblings. 1) sex is easy if you have just a basic sense of confidence and anatomy, honestly my first time (male or female) was not awkward so much as silly and playful 2) I've consistently embellished my FA-dom to partners but kept as close to the truth as I can get it. People aren't judgmental about it but  I also feel a lot of shame about it. The compromise phrase I find works is \"scarcity\". \"I've had a scarcity of sexual partners\", \"I've had a scarcity of close social relationships\". It imparts the same message but makes it vague enough to allow your partner to fill in the gaps rather than make you fill them in until you're ready 3) it seems as though the FA feeling never goes away, it's a poverty mindset, once you're poor you always feel poor even when you have money. Even when you are in a good thing, the feeling of having been FA and you remembrance of your wasted youth is likely going to continue to be a source of shame, but you can still build a good life despite one sore spot in your past.", "subreddit": "ForeverAlone"}

Never dated in my life, never told a woman I even liked her, things always went south before that happened or I freeze and never say anything. This was due to a combination of alot of things like  being morbidly obese, being dirt poor which in turn gave me extremely low confidence and made me avoid social situations and when I  had nothing but bad experiences combined with constantly beating myself up for my own faults just made it impossible for any connection to happen.\n\nAt this point in my life, I have money, not rich but enough to save and get to the point where I can't use that excuse anymore. My weight is under control, I'm still fat but always dropping. I'm at the lowest weight I've been in  over 25 years, I feel great in my body and my self esteem has risen. And as I continue to lose weight and build more muscle, that esteem will get even higher. I can't use this excuse anymore either. But someone I know  is always telling me that I will eventually get to a point where I will attract female attention and this is a point of concern for me because.....\n\nI don't care. I'm losing weight because I enjoy breathing and the feeling of an intense workout is an amazing way to relieve anxiety.  I don't have have any desire to talk to women who may even be interested. I don't have much of a desire to talk to men either for striking friendships. So many failures, humiliations, teasing and rejection have shaped me into a person who avoided social gatherings. Avoided things most people turn to for enjoyment and became deeply entrenched into anti-mainstream, counter culture and as such, I don't have many of the same ideals and thoughts most people have. My default attitude towards people were that they were idiots who hate me. So yeah, I'm sure many of you here can see how that attitude would lead to not having many friends and being pretty isolated. I wouldn't say I was hateful so much as depressed. And for the most part, I was fine with that until I met someone who responded to my snarky,sarcastic remarks with a smile and with words that enticed a fun conversation.\n\nThis person would continue with small talk over a period of several weeks and I remember hating it so much at first but  the previous conversations were good so I should make the effort. At some point  it hit me that we were talking for extended periods of time often and that it's been years since I talked with a woman this much that wasn't a relative. I began to notice she was very attractive and started being shy around her and starting to care alot about what I said, talking far less about 'negative' things,  but I just casts those thoughts aside. She was a friend I met in the gym who congratulated me on my weight loss. She is being nice, I'm just  getting excited because a woman is talking to me, stands close to me, and isn't repulsed when I hug her and just irrationally thinking she must want me.\n\nSo with that mindset, I buried my feelings because such thoughts and desires are for other people, but not for me. As time passed she got more comfortable with me to to the point of revealing more and more personal info and confiding in me whatever was bothering her, usually over text and she would be very apologetic for it. I didn't mind because it was her, it felt good to know someone wanted to share their genuine, inner thoughts with me. More importantly and without going into  those problems, I LOVED how there was another person who had gone through obesity, has anxiety, has been emotionally hurt, feels distance from people and introverted, all the things I can relate too! But unlike me, she hasn't let these feelings turn her into a miserable person who exempts themselves from society, no matter how bad it feels. For the first time in so long, I met someone who on the surface I wouldn't think I had anything in common with, a yearning for closeness and hope I never felt before.  \n\nAnd when that person starts telling me she wants a  relationship (not with me specifically) since it's been so long and telling me she is going to eat some where alone.....I shut down in fear. When I see her again, I  briefly say a greeting and then quickly walk away, I don't approach when I see her in the distance and hope she doesn't see me. I freeze during conversation and quickly try for an exit. I hate this feeling. The feeling of wanting something and yet being afraid to actually try to get it. I hate the part of myself that is weak enough to feel this self conscious about the unknown and yet strong enough to still have this much control. I've been trying for the past couple of months to just tell her and to hell with the outcome. Everyday I wait she could find someone else and the messed up part is I think this is what a part of me wants. Then I don't have to worry about telling her! She can be (hopefully)  happy and we can still be friends! That's what being alone for almost 4 decades can do to you. While everyone else would eagerly go for the prospect of asking someone out they are almost certain would agree, I'm just crippled by it.\n\nI had the will power to change my eating habits and stay consistent with a rigorous training schedule to lose hundreds of pounds. I found employment after spending years unemployed and in severe debt to not only pay off the debt, but to purchase a house. I can make drastic changes in life where I prove to myself that it can be done and I can do it, but telling someone I like them is the one thing that I cannot, and never could do. I've blamed so many people for how I ended up this way. My parents for not caring, women for judging me based on society's standards but you can only delude yourself for so long. The truth is I'm Forever Alone because of me and I'm glad it's Thanksgiving Weekend where I can talk to family members, because I'm too disgusted to be alone with myself right now.", "subreddit": "ForeverAlone"}

I'd be lying if I said I wasn't a tad spiteful over it, but not enough to have it effect anything. Like sour milk, just throw it away and move on.

But I guess I just want someone to show somekind of interest in me. Someone to check up other than my dentist, even getting some kind of positive attention would be nice. I'm not typically one of those softer people, apathy and basically being indifferent to most activities saw an end to that. But having someone to do that stupid claw thing down my back? Someone say I'm enough - well, anything to make me feel less hollow would be heaven frankly. \n\nAnyway that was my thing.

I think for most of us, there's a plethora of issues that factor in with each other that make the task of overcoming FA seem impossible. \n\nWhat things, if any, can you improve upon that would make overcoming FA slightly less daunting?\n\nA few things for me:\n\n1) My driving anxiety. I've had my license for a few years now but I still get really anxious when I have to drive to somewhere new. I'm scared of getting lost and getting in an accident. Several times I've skipped social events or chose not to go to one because I was scared to drive there and couldn't hitch a ride. I know that I gotta force myself to drive so that I can desensitize myself to the anxiety but god is it difficult. \n\n2) Intimidating resting face. I've been told by some people that my resting facial expression makes me seem like I'm angry... when I'm not. Others will say I look depressed and sad (sometimes true). Either way it puts people off and makes them uncomfortable. Some acquaintances that I've gotten to know told me they were scared to talk to me in the first place.  Doesn't help my FA when I scare people off before I even meet them. This hasn't been as big of a problem in the past couple of years because I've been working on it but it can still be improved on. \n\n3) Social skills/social anxiety. These two go hand in hand. Social anxiety keeps me from socializing because I'm scared of it so my social skills go into the toilet. Poor social skills feed backs into my social anxiety to make it a cycle. I'm almost never the first to engage a stranger in conversation. I plan on chatting with people in my next semester to get some practice with this.", "subreddit": "ForeverAlone"}

In my final year of college, and on top of already feeling like I squandered making friends in favor of dedication to school/work, I lost two of the closest people in my life about 2 weeks ago. One was someone who I had been best friends with since I was 11, and he is going to rehab in another state far away after being arrested. He was so much of my social identity and 1 of 3 in people who I know I could call at any time and know he would be there for me; because he has and I've done the same for him. I won't be able to contact him for 6 months-1 year and he is not allowed back here so I would need to go visit, and that is a difficult pill to swallow when just a month ago he lived 10 minutes away. This man was the brother I never grew up with, and it is killing me that he will never be around the way he used to be. I'm so mad, sad, sorry towards him for a litany of reasons that I didn't get to tell him, and may never. Without him in my life, I feel I've lost an undying loyalty that takes 10+ years to build. Our catchphrase to one another was \"say less\" because he knew what I wanted or needed in the same way I did with him.\n\nThe other person I lost was this girl who I have been on and off for two years, and after a misunderstanding and argument she decided to stop talking to me and responding any suggestions of talking things out. She even knows about the situation and she knows my friend, but it doesn't matter to her. I just don't matter to her in the same capacity that I used to, and the only person I could've honestly vented these feelings to and would help me process is going to rehab. The truth is, I'm posting here is because today she was on social media with/about some guy after ignoring my text today trying to be friends (its sounds unbelievable, but I genuinely love her as a human and want her in my life as someone I talk to, but understandably it isn't the time...I wish she would text me that or block me instead of nothing after we haven't spoken since the argument). \n\nI know I can rebuild, I think time will heal these fresh wounds to my heart, but right now I can't deny the truth that I am very alone, very sad, having strong feelings of inadequacy and abandonment, and honestly afraid that the empty void of these two leaving me is going to take forever to close because of how much they meant to my existence. Two people who were an asset to this life and my enjoyment of it are just gone and I can't put on a happy face about it and push through like I thought I could. It doesn't help that I can't celebrate holidays with family due to work obligations and the fact that I have no time to hang with the few friends I can muster up as this semester at school closes, so I'm struggling to see a light at the end of the tunnel where I can find time to get out of my own head.", "subreddit": "lonely"}

(2nd attempt) and one night I took a big bottle of wine from her again and I took a knife as well and I drank a shit load (I  wasn't that wasted) and I took it up to my neck and heart and head and I  just couldn't stop crying that night but I couldn't bring myself to do it. Now my third attempt it was very emotional because that day I was talking to a freind of mine about how sad and shit I was and this cunt came behind me and mocked me so I got up and got into a fight with him and pretty much everyone in that room was laughing at me. I know theirs not much context for this one girl which we've never dated or anything like that but shes one of the more popular girls she was actually very concerned for me and it was weird but I'm getting off track. When I got home I just gave up on my life and everything about it but I took a knife and I.........still couldn't bring myself to do it and i just broke down and I still couldn't bring my self to do it I just dont know what the fuck is wrong with me but my mother walked in on this and she got some government people over to the house and we talk fir a few hours. and a few hours ago I went to see my doctor about it and he said it was mild and critical depression which I have no idea what to make of it so yeah I dont know how to really end this but I guess thanks for reading this post.    \n\n\n\n\n(Ps)  I know my story is all over the place so u may not believe me. but I just dont really feel like putting this anywhere else but here so yeah I guess thank u for your time.", "subreddit": "lonely"}

I really do care though deep down and the desire is surfacing. I\u2019m watching a new YouTube channel and I wish I could be friends with the people that star in the skits. I\u2019ve been watching twitch compilations and I like the clips where people are doing things non game related like being with friends and I wish I were part of it. Aw jeez I\u2019m tearing up as I\u2019m writing lol...And the past few days I\u2019ve been interacting with reddit more than I ever had in the past because I want to have conversations now all of a sudden. I\u2019m stupid, lazy, fat FUCKER! Wooo....end rant...sorry for the wall of text...good night my peeps...", "subreddit": "ForeverAlone"}

I just needed to get this out.\n\nI'm an older single guy raising a son as best he can.  Nothing ever mattered to me other than having my own family.  \"Good Father, good husband, good friend\" is all I wanted on my tombstone.  I worked my ass off since I was twelve years old to do it.  I've fought everything one can think of to get here with a pulse.  (I experienced fairly severe abuse when I was a child.  A therapist once said I had about a 4% chance of not ending up dead before the age of 30.)  \n\nI did a good job at not losing it entirely when I came home from work to find my family had disappeared.  The wife for whom I had worked and faced my greatest demons found she would prefer to be with her ex-boyfriend.  I couldn't find my son for months until I called in favors from guys I served with back in the day.  I got him back and gained custody.\n\nI found love again until her personality disorder showed itself.  I'm now in a city I was trying to avoid living in with no friends and no family.  I've only got myself to give my son.  It's damned difficult meeting people never mind a lover.  \n\nI worked my ass off my whole life for what ended up being an illusion, a mirage.  Yes, I've got my son and I'm very thankful for him.  Still, I'm a man and have needed the touch of a woman who has an emotional investment in me, who loves me.  I can look back now and see that I have literally never been loved that way.  I've simply been used and then discarded when I became inconvenient.  It's not even depression talking.  It's mere statement of fact.  No one has ever touched me in love.  It's been deceit and disorder.  Manipulation.  The abuse I suffered as a child continues to this day in that I never knew what it meant to have someone put love into action and direct it towards me.  Disgustingly, my son was conceived in deceit.  \n\nI'm one of the mentally and emotionally strongest people I know.  I've seen shit no one should ever see.  I've beaten the odds every single time.  I'm still standing, still alive, still working to do the right thing by my son.  I'm a decent man.  I try to do the right thing in everything I do.  I'm pretty decent looking.  I've got my priorities straight.  Frankly, I'd be a catch.  \n\nBut, I'm tired of holding onto hope that I might be recognized for who I am, the battles I've fought, the road I've traveled to get here. I'm tired of being alone.  I can be strong in this way no longer.  I cannot continue to believe that love might be just around the corner.  I'll still do what I have to do.  It's just that to do it alone, without all that a woman could bring to my life, is painful.  The only way I know to continue is to accept I will be lonely.  I'm good at it.  I've done it my whole life.  I'm just tired of fighting against it.  I fear the example it sets for my son.  I just can't do it any longer.  I have nothing left.  No more faith in that magic connection, a spiritual connection with the woman I love.  There's no one to love and no one seems interested in the sort of love that flows through me.  I have no more faith and hope in this.  I dedicated my life to love.  It was an illusion.  It'll eventually kill me if I don't just accept it.\n\nNow, all I have left is to work to be remembered as a good father before I'm scattered to the wind.", "subreddit": "lonely"}

Mostly I only listen while they're joking or talking about stuff. I only throw a few questions or responses regarding of what they're talking about. \n\nSince I only listened, I was also observing which a habit of mine. Yesterday, I sat beside the most popular of them. She is a cosplayer, pretty famous in my uni and been travelling cities for events. I noticed a scar in her elbow, without hestitation, I asked her about it while the other busy with their food and phone. She had a little pause before answered me. \"You know, I was suicidal, wanting to die shit\". I was a bit shocked. And then she showed me her scars on her left lower arm, and it actually pretty visible. I was thinking to respond her with \" I know the feeling, I did the same\" because I self-harm myself that morning, but judging by her scars, I knew she cut herself pretty deep than I did.  So I just take a pause before I say that I understand and we moved on to the next topic.\n\nThe other day, I was really stupid to do a week deadline task in four hours, I took a break for a minute on instagram and looking at stories. One caught my attention. It was black and white, posted around midnight and it was a glimpse of a  video on youtube. It was some texts saying something about being depressed. I had to go back pause it, I tried to read the title of video and apparently it was \"I wanna die\". It struck me and broke my heart. My first instinct was to reach the account owner, and apparently it was someone from my department, but we never talked even tho we've been to the same classes and I see her around uni sometimes. But I decided to send her a message asking if she was okay, and she replied pretty quick which suprising because it was around 3 am. She answered that she's not in the good state but she can handle it. The conversation ends with us wishing each other a nice day. \n\nSometimes, I look at people and wondering \"What if I take those masks away and see what they really are from what they've been going through ?\" But then I realized with the ones I put on and in the end, I just walk away.", "subreddit": "lonely"}

Would be cool to know if anyone else is in a similar situation to me.\n\nI'm a 25 year old male living with 2 of my best friends of 13+ years, we all have great chemistry and genuinely like and care about each other. I also have lots of other friends who i see on a fairly regular basis and I also live in the same city as my family whom I love dearly. I work as a gardener a few times a week and really get along with the other guys that I work with, I'm doing a horticulture course once a week which I really enjoy and I get along with all the people on the course. I also work in a garden centre on the weekends and again, I really get along with all the people there and have some good laughs and jokes with them.\n\nI have lots of people who care about me and support me, yet I just feel totally disconnected all the time and whenever I'm not preoccupied with something I can't help but just think about how lonely I am, it brings me to the point of tears most evenings. It sounds totally insane given the fact that I'm surrounded by people but I just feel totally alone. It's weird, because I know these people in my life care about me and if I was to tell them how I was feeling they would want to help me. But what do I say? I'm lonely? Then what? What's the antidote? I have people in my life who I love, and who love me back. What else do I need? It's like I love my friends and family, yet I don't connect with them. Or perhaps I do connect with them when I'm with them and enjoying their company but then when I'm alone it all feels hollow and empty upon reflection. It feels like no amount of conversation, opening up or quality time will fill this weird hole that I have in my mind.\n\nSometimes I think getting a girlfriend would help as I'm definitely jealous of my friends, almost all of whom are in long term relationships. \n\nWithout sounding like a dick, I'm a pretty attractive guy. I've never struggled to get dates or hookups but, at 25 years old I've not once had a girlfriend. Not a single person I've ever dated or hooked up with has wanted to pursue anything serious with me. I'm starting to think there's something about me that I'm not aware of that puts people off. I'm passionate about my work in horticulture, I have multiple hobbies like music production, piano and cycling. I've never had a hard time making people laugh or engaging in long, thoughtful conversations with people. I'm certainly a likeable guy, I know I am. But honestly I've been on dates where we've been together for like 8 hours straight and have had great non-stop conversations and shared loads of laughs and  bonded over lots of things. But then they always just tell me they see me more as a friend. Or they'll fuck me then say they don't want to see me again.\n\nI also worry that if I do manage to get myself a girlfriend, I'll end up feeling the exact same thing that I feel with everyone else in my life. Love but no connection.\n\nIt's gotten to the point where I feel really guilty and stupid about the way I'm feeling. It's like I've got most of the ingredients to a happy, fulfilling life but it just doesn't work.", "subreddit": "lonely"}

(good old: If a person looks at you for more than 6 seconds, they either want to kill you or have sex with you). I definitely realized that she probably was indicating interest.\n\n\nI started to contemplate coming up to her and trying to chat with her or just grab her phone number.\n\n\nBut then i asked myself, whats the point? \n\n\nI am 26 yo adult virgin. I dont have friends. I dont have any life action. My life for past years has been absolute futile boring garbage. I dont have fun cool stories to share with her and no friends company to invite her to and do leisure activites with. \n\n\nIm not a killer at my job, im not a dominant guy, who can lead a girl and who knows where his life is going and so on. \n\n\nNot to mention that even if i chat her up somehow after getting her phone number or whatever and we'd escalate things further at my or her appartment, more likely my dick would just jam out of perfomance pressure, inexperience and stress.

Im not sure what is the strategy to escape from here, but it's a nighmare life situation to find yourself in. \n\n\n\nIt's just one of those cases that shouldnt happen to you, like being in jail, for instance.\n\n\nAlso i still keep thinking 'what if', because i heard from a female colleague from work that she met her husband in actual god damn subway wagon.
