By my senior year, I had literally zero friends. Not exaggerating. I had an apartment on canous with 3 random women and most of my memories from my junior and Senior year in college are me locked in my bedroom watching Netflix and drinking wine by myself and holding my piss for as long as possible so I didn't have to confront my roommate and her friends who were always sitting and having fun in the living room to get to the bathroom. I lived in the party town so it was depressing hearing parties every weekend. \n\nI joined a professional dance team. I had another (not close, but in constant contact) group of friends from that. One of them became my BEST friend. I retired from the team. 3 years later and I am no longer in contact with them. \n\nI dated a great guy for 6 months recently and he has so many friends from, middle school, high school, and college.

That's not my point, though\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPart of my convictions is hoping for the destruction of every relationship I come across.

Y'know, so I don't come off as \"discriminating\" \n\n\n\n\nHowever, every blue moon I'm met with \"you should be happy for these people.\" A guy came in work the other day and the conversation somehow came up that he recently got married. I felt no obligation to say \"congratulations,\" so I didn't. I said \"heh, cool\" and changed the conversation when it was appropriate to do so. I'm bitter about this kinda shit because, quite frankly, some normies are more equal than others\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe point I'm trying to get at in this post is -- imagine Hell *finally* froze over and our \"someone for everyone\"s magically appeared out of the woodwork and we were happy. There'd be a few things wrong with the \"shoe on the other foot\" instance \n\n\n\n1 ) Normies don't give a damn what we think, and that's literally the *only* thing I admire about them \n\n\n\n\n2 ) They would do everything in their power to break us up, because, as I'm sure we all know here, we are \"monsters that don't deserve love.\"  Cock blocking, heckling, eventually it'd get to the point where she wouldn't even want to be seen with me in public because **that's** just how people are. \n\n\n\n\nSo yeah, we should be happy for normies in relationships but whenever we so much as *have desire* to be in one, guess who's the first one to squish those dreams? \n\n\n\nThe same people we're supposed to be \"happy for.\" \n\n\n\n\n\nI refuse that. **TL;DR** : If you're in a relationship, I hope you two break up.

He was capable of integrating with the main stream and popular culture, but I digress. It seems, looking back on it, that us ever becoming friends was nothing more than pure and utter luck, and since I no longer have the confidence normally to just straight up ask people if they like something, complete strangers, is there really any hope of ever meeting someone similar? And it didn't feel like it was just common interests that led to that instant friendship, it also had to be supporting personalities and general happenstance that all the stars aligned, and at that very moment of that very day we would both be open to the idea of meeting someone new in real life and playing games together.

So how is it that girls hate me enough to \u201cghost\u201d me, yet they love this asshole. Apparently enough to let him cheat on them and still stay with him even though they know he cheated. Girls love every guy around me but hate me with a venomous passion. So what I want to know is, how come my friends treat girls like crap like this yet everything works out great for them and I can\u2019t even get one girl on this damn planet to take even a slight interest in me? To girls I\u2019m not sexually attractive, I\u2019m nothing a nobody. girls hate me and they choose every other guy over me. I have no experience in dating or relationships and i will die a lonely virgin, when all I wanted was one girl to give me a chance.  I failed and I\u2019m going to give up. its hopeless if I can\u2019t get a girl to like me now there is no chance that will ever change. Girls only like guys who treat them like shit as evidenced by everything I have seen. Girls don\u2019t want a guy like me who would never cheat on them they are only after bad boys and as I\u2019m not one I\u2019m screwed. so I\u2019m not going to bother or try anymore because even if I do the result will evidently be the same. just like it has been for the last 25 miserable years of my existence on this planet.", "subreddit": "ForeverAlone"}

At least that\u2019s what I was taught to believe. Growing up in an Asian household I was also told to believe that if I studied hard and got into a good college and was a responsible citizen, and yada yada yada, then girls would start flocking my way. Week one of university was like waking up from the Matrix. You ever just realize one day half your life has been built off a total bullshit lie?\n\nIf college wasn\u2019t a kick between the eyes, actually working in real life was. \n\nSo I sit by this young, attractive female co-worker near my cubicle. I\u2019ve noticed that she visibly treats some of the more attractive male interns on my team well. She goes out of her way to help them with projects and reports. She\u2019s nicer to them and always laughs and makes jokes with them, even doesn\u2019t mind being teased. During lunch she always picks the open seat by them and seems to really enjoy associating with them even though I\u2019ve overheard them making really off-color remarks about her when she was like a few feet away. She usually just blushes and pretends to laugh any discomfort off. \n\nI\u2019ve also noticed There\u2019s another intern on my team who is Super nice, is highly intelligent, and seems polite and friendly for the most part. But he\u2019s also not a \u201cChad\u201d in terms of looks, I\u2019ll just put it at that. My co worker does not reciprocate to any of his conversations. She seems to say hi to most people on my team who come in every morning except him. During lunch one time the only open seat at the break room table was by him, and I noticed how she hesitated for a second and then just left even though she has sat at the table every day before then. \n\nI\u2019m not sure if he\u2019s offended her personally and maybe I\u2019m just making assumptions here, but I highly doubt it from what I\u2019ve seen. He\u2019s super nice and courteous to everyone on my team and even brings in snacks and cakes for us. I notice how my co worker seems to talk normally to everyone save for him, who she treats noticeably very coldly. One time he walked by our cubicle and I overheard her mutter under her breath how he was a \u201cfreak\u201d or something. It\u2019s almost like she hates him for no reason. \n\nThen I thought back to my experiences in college and my observations there, and I started to notice similarities all across the board. I remembered how one of my short and ethnic classmates tried to start a casual conversation about the homework with this sorority girl in my section, and she completely ignored him and gave him one sentence replies before changing seats. The next day a real athletic \u201cChad\u201d sits by her and literally asks her the same problems on the same homework, and she\u2019s all giggly and willing to chat him up, and starts asking him about his major and focus and all that.\n\nThat\u2019s all I wanted to say.

Yes, she's attractive, has a wild personality with a sense of humor that always got me to laugh. At 16 she was constantly going out to party with her friends.

They laugh again, and then I hear one of the guys say \"Well yeah, my 13 year old brother probably gets laid more than him\", followed up by the first girl adding on \"Guys like that don't get laid either\".

She coolly said maybe in September.

I would lay my life down for him if I had to do so. Anyways while were hanging out over the weekend two of our other friends decided to prank him. They thought leaving a plastic bag filled with ketchup and a scary note would be funny. Now I didn't know any details about anything other than being told there was a bag and a scary in front of his door. At first my best friend and I thought it was this really creepy stalker we knew and we thought we was back and somehow snuck inside his place while we were hanging out. So immediately got worked up think something real bad was about to happen. My best friend told me he was shaking and didn't feel comfortable in his own home (this was before he realized it was ketchup and I was still left in the dark on most of what was going on). So later on I messaged the two other friends and I explained why I was upset and how he reacted and all of that and that they should be more considerate and know exactly what they are doing to who. I was being nice and I wasn't yelling or anything but apparently that made me \"spiteful and pathetic\".  No one bothered telling me much of anything other at the beginning so I didn't really know what was going on and I was thinking the worst. So I had to apologize for showing concern for my best friend.  This is really bothering me more than it should but I can't help it. I don't want to lose any friends but after their response I feel like I don't matter much to them.  So I don\u2019t know....I guess I ended doing harm without meaning to do so.  If either of you two read this don't talk to me please. Just go away and leave me alone and you won't ever have to deal with me again I promise.   I'm posting this cause I have no one I feel like I can talk too and I just need to vent so please don't hate me for this..

All the people who end up in relationships drew their partners from this tiny subset. This subset is probably pretty representative of people as a whole: most people are pretty similar to each other anyway, you're unlikely to meet anyone truly unique. So: you've met enough people. And none of those people want you. Which means it's very likely there's something wrong with you. Nature wants most individuals to reproduce. DNA wants to replicate itself. Most people don't have to try particularly hard to find partners, they certainly don't plan them like military campaigns, the way you're asked to. I mean - why would nature put obstacles in its own way? So maybe there's a reason you can't pair up: there's something badly wrong with you. I know I've felt it, felt it from a very young age. I've known there's something wrong me from when I first really started intensely desiring others. I knew those desires would never be reciprocated. Knew I'd be alone forever.

It may not look pretty to anyone else, but it's yours. **That's** what a relationship is like.

I would have a parent and maybe a sibling come, or maybe even some of my cousins and aunts, but who would be my best man? On a related topic- If I got divorced and on the street, where the hell would I go? Who would I go for consolation when I have no friends?\n\nWhat I worry about too is the funeral problem. According to some facebook post by a relative, \"You know you're Polish-American if you fixate on death all too often and casually discuss it.\" There's that, and on top of suicide idealization, I also recently had a heart monitor strapped to my chest after a heart-attack scare. I'm 20 years old, vegetarian, worked out daily and ran three miles in spring semester- since college let out I now only walk two miles and go bouldering two-three times a week; and still had a resting bpm of 90-100bpm. Occasionally it skips. So... is it weird or normal for me to think about my own funeral? \n\nwho would show up to my funeral? Who would even care? What would anyone say? Here lies \\_\\_\\_\\_, Who did nothing, he never accomplished anything, never had a love of his life. I've had to bury my father, funerals are expensive no matter what route you go. If I died, the worse thing I imagine is my brothers angrily swearing out my name as they have to take time off work and jeopardize their own precarious situations to come up and help my mom try to set up a funeral and pay for it all, only to see her cry more as maybe ten people show up. \n\nOr in worse case scenario... Would I just end up being the guy who dies alone in their apartment, and no one finds out? What happens to the body no one claims?", "subreddit": "lonely"}

I have gained, lost, and left friends over the course of several years, and so far have found that not one of them is willing to put in the effort of maintaining and strengthening our friendship, beyond the first couple of months at least. I have very little friends because of this since at some point you realize you're so sick of chasing after people who don't care enough to do the same. The friends I do have are not very close friends, mostly friends by circumstance, but I fear that I cling to these fragile friendships, probably too much in their eyes, because I'm so terrified to be alone. I look at people who have big friend groups and I don't know how they do it, most people I think could be good friends turn out to be stuck in that petty highschool mindset of I'm better than you so will somehow put you down. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI guess my low self-esteem comes from both lack of friends and lack of being able to keep the friendships I do have. This is where I wonder if I'm the problem. Is it my personality that puts people off? I honestly don't know. For example: when it was my birthday a couple of years ago, I was the youngest of the group so pretty excited to finally be turning 16, looking back I don't know why, earlier in the year I had gone all out for my best friend at the time. When it came to mine, I didn't understand why nobody had done something similar, I wasn't expecting a big huge present like I had got them (maybe hoping, but not expecting). Even a pizza lunch would have made my day, which was something we did for our friends birthdays, later after my birthday, I found out that a group chat had been made to organize it but my close friends at the time soon decided I talked too much about my birthday so they weren't going to get me anything past a card. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAs you can imagine I was extremely hurt, not to mention this was one of the reasons I started to spiral hard into depression. Honestly, I don't think my self-esteem has really built up since them, I constantly doubt myself, if I'm talking too much, not listening enough, putting enough/too much effort into friendships. I have since changed friend groups of which I have since kept friends with 2-3 people after leaving for university. At university I didn't find as many friends as I thought I would, has anyone been in a similar situation? I guess I just don't know if I'm so lonely because of self-sabotage or not. But by God does loneliness creep up on you at the weirdest of times. Has anyone been in a similar situation? If so, please give me advice on what I'm doing wrong.", "subreddit": "lonely"}

{"post_id": "c8ytgm", "created_utc": 1562219039, "title": "Feeling betrayed and angry", "author": "Doggiedoggieafreak", "self_text": "I befriended an older woman at a grocery store about 2 years ago, she's about my mother's age, somewhere in her 50s. We would have conversations about random things. She told me very private things, such as building a new house somewhere else because (something along the lines of) \"you never know what your husband will do.\" I believe she was alluding to him cheating or something. I recall she would bite her lips every time we spoke. She always wanted to show me something on her phone, giving it to me, and then grabbing my hand in such a touchful stance when I returned it. She told me that before she got married, she was a youthful girl that loved to go out to the bars and dance. Eventually she got older and realized she had to settle down. She told me in a very begrudging way that she had to settle with her boring husband that doesn't even dance or do anything. I eventually felt the need to court her. I could tell she wanted some young stud that would satisfy her and I wanted a mature older lady that played no games.\n\nBack in April, during my day off from work, I'm at home by myself and decide to ask her out. I have about 2 or 3 beers by myself and walk to the grocery store, waiting for the opportunity. I never had an issue approaching random women in the past 3 years but somehow this older woman was an exception. She made me feel like a dumb clueless kid with oneitis all over again. We have a small chit chat and feeling the butterflies raged inside but having the facade of confidence, I asked her, \"When was the last time you went out?\"\n\nI don't recall if I mentioned her husband but who cares.\n\nShe tells me it was a long time since the last time and I just tell her, \"Let's go out\" and she said ok. I asked her when would be a good day and she said Sunday since it was her only day off. I suggested seeing each other in the evening around 6. I left the store feeling like a fucking boss.\n\nThe day before Sunday, I walk in and ask her if she's ready for tomorrow. She tells me maybe, saying it will embarrassing for her to be seen with someone much younger than her, and tells me to text her. I tell her she doesn't even text me back in the first place. She tells me to text her and we start texting again, but she only texted back and forth for about 3 times. We never confirm anything. I felt angry. Where did I fuck up?\n\nSide note: When I told her that she doesn't text me, she showed me the amount of people she texts. She showed me the example of this one guy who texts her at an approximate 7:1 ratio. He looked like he was trying to court her as well.\n\nA couple of weeks later in May, I walk into the grocery store again after feelings of embarrassment prevented me from doing it earlier. We spoke for a bit pretending that the last time we saw each other never happened and I insisted with the question \"So what happened?\" alluding to the incident. Eventually she \"realized\" what I was referring to and told me \"I'm married\"\n\nMy heart sunk. I was so dedicated to courting this married woman that was very likely bored of her dead bedroom. We spoke in such a manner that her husband would react the same way if he found out about what we spoke about.\n\nI just brushed it off and walked back home. I was no longer the same when I would see her there. I would still go to this grocery store every now and then and she would attempt initiating a conversation but I don't even make an effort in sustaining it any longer. It's like seeing your crush in the hallways and you get the butterflies inside. I have no idea if I should even consider talk to her again. Should I just avoid the drama to not be dissapointed and led on again? This woman dumped a boatload of her issues onto me signalling she's bored of her husband but then tells me \"I'm married\" as an excuse for not going out after not mentioning him the first time I asked her out.\n\nIf I learned anything from this, never bother pursuing a married woman, even if she signals to you she's open.\n\nI wasn't sure which subreddit to post this on. The normies call me an asshole for falling for her. The incels got upset I managed to talk to a woman. The manosphere calls me a beta for even caring about her. I feel so depressed.

A girl that I went to high school with both of them before I moved to another school has 11k followers. She\u2019s basically Instagram model tier but I\u2019m not really sure if she\u2019s actually a insta model. I see she\u2019s travelling the world, wearing expensive clothing, partying etc. I see pages are wanting to sponsor her too. \n\nThis girl was a bitch to me in high school. She would ridicule and bully me. I actually liked her (god knows why) and she even pretended to be my girlfriend until the following school day when it was a joke among her and her group, after this I hated her. She was always being the over the top typical high school girl too. \n\nI would say this angers me, but it does not even though I still hate for what she did to me. She\u2019s obviously living off mummy and daddy\u2019s money to do the things she wants and when she\u2019s old, when her parents are gone and she runs out of money, she won\u2019t know what to do.

She was actually really nice to me, would often ask how I\u2019m going, she even gave me a hug on the last day of school and wished me luck before I moved. I believe she wasn\u2019t really apart of what her friend did to me because she was pretty new to the school at the time.

I cant really explain it properly but it all started when I was kid, I had a pretty tough childhood, I used to get bullied a lot and beaten on occasions since I was in 2nd or 3rd grade till A levels and the experience left me blank and emotionless with thoughts of suicide (still have them). At one point I beat the bullies themselves but in the end everyone around me became afraid of me, the way they looked at me as if I was a monster. I had some friends but in reality it was just me lying to myself. My parents never really understood me, I used to get beaten and threatened (to disown) by them when I would fail tests or if my tutors pointed out that I wasnt paying attention in class. At one point my mom threatened me with a big kitchen knife. I had no one to talk to about what I was going through so I decided to be alone, be independent and I shut myself off from everyone. I have spent most of my life like that because I thought that I would be better off without anyone.\n\nWhat really got me through all this was gaming and art. I never thought about what I wanted to do in life and there were times when I doubted myself so much that I hated myself for it. I tried a few places but I ended up dropping out until I found out about studying abroad. I had a tough time convincing my parents about what I wanted to do because they are old-fashioned but despite the circumstances I ended up studying in UK and graduated with a degree in Games Design but I never felt like I accomplished anything. My dad still thought of it as a joke and in he wanted me to go back and do his business. The later years were hell when I was getting rejection emails from where ever I applied. At one point I almost gave up but then I got a call for a job and I took it. I wanted to get away from my overly over-protective, megalomaniac parents and their schemes, I wanted to give living by myself a shot.\n\nNow I live alone, independent and have a job for over a year but since the past few months, I've been fighting a losing fight against depression. The fact I am depressed is because of my parents trying to pull the strings, if things go south then I have to deal with the mess they left for me. I feel empty and all alone, I have started losing interest in my work, my hobbies and even eating and sleeping. Its eating me from the inside. I hate myself for putting myself in this position and to make things worse when I started watching anime and after seeing those relatable situations, it just hurts me a lot that I did this to myself. I really wished I had friends like the characters did and have people around me that understood me. All I do now is watch anime and cry, the pain is unbearable. I wish I had a shoulder to cry on or atleast get a hug when things became too much to handle. I dont want to be hurt again.\n\nI live in **Pakistan** and I dont think there is much I can do to get social again. Its very hard for me to talk to people and I am afraid they will call me a monster like everyone else did back in school.

I've been using Whisper for over 5 years since I broke up with my first and last long term relationship, and luckily there are nice people on there to talk to if you're going through something but for the most part it's just horny men hounding after vulnerable women. \n\nI was born and raised in Worcester, MA and I never really had friends. I did have a circle in high school but some weird drama thing happened where we were all pitted up against each other and no one talked to each other since. I did have one friend but he always hung out with other people and put them before me. College was even worse. Only one guy talked to me and all he'd ever do was talk about his girlfriend. It's not that I didn't try to make friends but it was one of those Catholic/party colleges and I felt out of place since I wasn't into sports or church and there weren't any clubs or organizations I was interested in to join. Basically if you took everyone on Tinder and put them all in one place, that was my school. \n\nThe last time I was happy was last month. I met a guy when I was on vacation in Sweden and we connected right away. He said he was alright with a long distance relationship but of course by the time I went back home, he just didn't have feelings for me anymore. Guess I can't blame him\u2014 if it's not there, it's not there. But still, never met anyone like him before and he just made me so goddamn happy... I've always wanted a real, non-toxic relationship but I guess it's just not in the cards for me. No one has ever been interested in me where I live and there's no where for me to go to meet people since I'm afraid to go out on my own. There's a lot of stabbings in Worcester.\n\nAnyways I can write all day about my shitty life but if you want to know more about any of this or if you're interested in talking to me, just PM me.

I always thought the whole \"cooties\" thing was ridiculous because I was trying to talk to girls when I was like 7 and shit.  Back in second grade, I had a crush on this girl, Eileen.  When I tried talking to her on the playground, she got mad and said she didn't want someone ugly like me talking to her.  I thought that would be the end of it, but when I was walking back home from school, I found her brother and two of her friends waiting for me.  They basically told me that if they caught a \"skinny freak\" like me talking to his sister that they'd kick my ass.  And to drive the point home, the two friends carried me over to some rather thorny bushes and dropped me in there before laughing and walking away.  I didn't tell anyone about the episode, but I made sure to stay away from that girl going forward.\n\nThe guy did end up telling people about what happened the next day and after that, I got a nickname \"twiggy,\" both because I was super skinny like a twig and because I was stuck full of twigs after my encounter with the bushes I got dropped into.  I think that last part kinda faded away, but the nickname stuck with me all the way through middle school where people would make fun of me in the locker room because I was so skinny.\n\nStrangely enough, when I moved to California to go to high school, I was at a school where nobody heard about my second grade humiliation, but they coincidently gave me the exact same nickname, again because I was super skinny.

Just wanted to get this off my mind.\n\nI'm the type of person who always wants to have a conversation with someone (except when I'm asleep of course lol). In all the years I've been alive, so many people have tried but they all go ghost on me. Heck, I actually joined reddit in hopes that I can find one constant person (a female preferably) to talk to, to let my emotions out.\n\nIn the past month, I've met a few who was willing to \"listen\", so generally everything goes okay until they ask me why I'm always so lonely. Naturally, I tell them my story then say that I have to man up and when I try to continue they either disappear or don't reply anymore. It's been like that for so many times I've become cold to new people who try.\n\nSo... what do I want in a person to talk to? I just want someone who will listen. Just let me talk about my insecurities, my rejections, my failures, my crushed dreams. Don't interrupt me, don't say encouraging words like: \"Oh but I'm sure someone has it worse than you.\", they don't help and makes me more miserable. I just want someone who can tolerate and accept me, possibly motivate me to become a better person. No \"you have to man up\", no \"I won't judge you\" in the start but will leave because they can't handle my shit.\n\nI just want a genuine connection with someone. Someone who I can be with. If that doesn't sound right, then may be I really am better off alone.", "subreddit": "ForeverAlone"}

It may be ''context'' loneliness so I'm not sure if it's the right place to post it, but I figure if the feedback in the comments can help me, it may also guide somebody else. It's a universal thing to feel this ''gap'' in your heart after a series of bad relationships, so this will probably resonate with a lot of you anyhow.\n\nSo I've been in a relationship with a sociopath for three years. We were almost the same person, at least I thought we were. Both trans, back then both wanting to get out there and make it in the world of pro wrestling, both great writers (we met through RP). He lied about a lot of shit and ultimately I realized he'd been leading me on. \n\nTried in every way to reestablish communication and figure out what went wrong. Even gave him another chance to see if he'd changed, months after the breakup. Turns out he's still the same asshole (probably worse). He didn't even try to work on the friendship in a respectful way, so I had to kick him out of my life.\n\nSoon after, it felt like I'd been going thru a period of denial of my sexuality. I'm a gay AND trans AND ace person so I've been struggling to figure out how to approach the dating scene (I know it's a process, but yeah).\n\nI met a woman I started REALLY connecting with and opened up to her in ways I hadn't for awhile. The moment I opened up about how I'm pretty sure I'm gay (even though I've had some confusion about possibly being bi) it started messing things up between us and she lashed out and ended up sending me the classic ''I'm sorry for fucking up, you deserve better friends than me'' and blah...\n\nThere have been several people in the past months just entering my life, staying for awhile (weeks of opening up, hanging out a lot, etc.) then eventually fucking up out of the blue to the point they became toxic to me OR just decided to leave thru the back door for no reason.\n\nI'm at a point where to be brutally honest (I don't know if it's my depression talking or what) - I have NO idea how to let someone in anymore. Not without counting down the days until they ''break character'' and show their ''real face'', or simply lose interest in me and stop talking to me soon as they've got what they need from me. It's leaving me in a spot where not only do I want to stay single for as long as I can help it to protect my sanity, but I also stopped believing in friendships.\n\nAny advice on how to open up to life again and trust that human connection isn't simply an illusion? After all this I'm having a hard time believing. Been trying to stick to a healthy routine, keeping my mind and body busy, but really the fact I'm doing all this to avoid reminding myself of how alone I feel... it's getting daunting.", "subreddit": "lonely"}

I went back to college and I was in my mid 20's. She was a freshman. We talked in class together but other guys in the class kept hitting on her making her uncomfortable. In my case I was new to the school and just because I wasn't hitting on her, she would talk to me. I know people will assume I was being an evil nice guy who was just being her friend because I wanted to win her over from being a friend into a boyfriend. In reality we clicked and my only intentions were to finally make a friend at this college. Yes, she was attractive but I didn't talk to her just because of that. There was another woman in the class who I sat next to who was beautiful and I got butterflies just looking into her eyes. She had the most amazing eyes. Now with her I knew she was way out of my league and we didn't talk outside of class. If I saw her, I would wave and she would wave back. \n\nThis woman who I got along with ended up in the same class as me when I came back from Winter break. It was nice seeing her in a larger class and she didn't have to deal with guys hitting on her  but the more I talked to her, the more I found we had things in common like a similar taste in music, similar interests, and I really liked talking to her. I assumed she had a boyfriend because women who look like that usually aren't single. She never mentioned a boyfriend but I knew to not flirt with her. I know some people will think I only was interested in having her as a girlfriend but no, shockingly, I had another motivation with her. There is nothing wrong with wanting to be friends with a woman. Not every guy is an evil nice guy because he gets along with a woman without flirting with her. I thought we could be close friends that hung out together. \n\nDuring the semester we almost always sat next to each other. We would talk during class but after class she would never offer to hang out with me. I assumed she wasn't comfortable with me to where she would want to spend time outside of class with me. I assumed eventually she would want to spend time with me. I'm going to mention this a third time. I wasn't trying to get with her in a sexual way. Most people were weirded out by me. She wasn't and seemed to not mine my social awkwardness. \n\nDuring the semester I wanted to be able to talk to her outside of class as a friend and she gave me her email address which was weird because you don't just give a friend your email address. Eventually she gave me her AIM screen name. We would talk on AIM but if I mentioned hanging out in person she quickly changed the subject. I constantly got pictures of her dog. She also was a big sports fan like me and she sent me pictures of her at games. The pictures showed that she was wealthy. Her father was a wealthy businessman. She lived in a large house in ths suburbs. She showed me pictures of her friends and they were also wealthy who lived near her. These were her friends from high school who also went to my college. I started telling myself, she probably doesn't want to hang out because in a social circle filled with kids from wealthy families, I wouldn't belong. This was confirmed when one day I was in line for lunch when I noticed she and a friend were in front of me. I said hi to her and her friend turned around, looked at me with that disgusted look I was used to from other people. She looked at my friend in a way that said, eww, you talk to him? She became very uncomfortable and quickly walked away to sit with her. I could tell her just being seen with me was a risk to her social status. After that she stopped talking to me on AIM. She stopped responding to my e-mails. Eventually she ghosted on me. She even stopped sitting next to me and actually avoided me the rest of the semester. In college, if someone in a social circle wants to make a new friend, they have to be accepted by other people in the social circle. These people were wealthy and attractive. I had no chance. I didn't care that she was wealthy. I didn't care about anything except just wanting to be her friend. I never was able to connect with anyone on the same level again at that college. \n\nI apologize for the long rant but it brought back memories of talking to her. \n\nTl;dr: Met a woman in college. We got along. I wanted to be her friend but she became uncomfortable with that. It turns out she was wealthy and saying hi in front of another wealthy friend causes her to risk her social status by still talking to me. She ghosted on me after that day.", "subreddit": "ForeverAlone"}

I feel so alone rn I need some release, so here I am. My grandfather passed away a few weeks back and this weekend is his celebration of life thing (my Dad has a conniption any time I say funeral lol). We're staying with my grandmother in her apartment for the weekend since they lived a ways away.\n\nMy Grandmother raped me several times when I was a child, and only in the past few months have I realised I had repressed it. I told my mum, and she kinda guilted me into not telling anyone, as she believes my Dad wouldn't believe me and it would destroy the family (she's probably right). So on top of grieving my grandpa, I now have to spend the weekend in confined quarters with this woman. The funny thing is I don't even really hate her, but I just feel incredibly uneasy and helpless.\n\nMy mum has been acting all buddy-buddy with my Grandmother, and since she knows, it's making me feel even more gross. On top of that, I've shared my worries and anxiety about all this with my two best friends, but neither really gave much effort to empathise. The only person who cares is my therapist, which makes me feel even worse. I'm hoping once this weekend is over things will be okay, but right now I'm feeling not so nice.", "subreddit": "lonely"}

We were never perfect and making the relationship work was a huge strain on both of us for very different reasons. The months leading up to our Separation were hard for me, first we spoke of polygamy and I did my best to support her by guiding her through her new crushes and offering what advice I could to help her make things work, all while trying to process and just kinda slowly dying on the inside. Next she started reconnecting with a friend from her hometown and not technically lying to me or being dishonest but also not telling me she had really started liking him and planned to move in with him as soon as we were over. Either way, we mutually decided that neither one of us despite absolutely loving each other could try to fix our shambled broken marriage any longer.\n\nNow.. my ex wife for all her flaws is an amazing and fantastic woman who has changed my life in so many positive ways that I will forever be grateful. As much as it kills me to know she\u2019s with someone else I am so proud of her for making advances in her life that she needed. I still love that woman, a bit differently now that all this pain has happened but if this new boyfriend treats her right then I have nothing but love for that man as well. We\u2019re still friends and talk a few times a week. ( I\u2019m kinda low key coaching her through her new relationship because she\u2019s just as much a mess but couldn\u2019t find it in herself to stay single and work on herself like I\u2019m struggling to do. )All I\u2019ve ever wanted and fought for was her happiness. So please do not speak ill of my ex wife if it can be avoided. She doesn\u2019t deserve it, I would let you know if she did.\n\nNow to my dilemma. I\u2019m alone, in a different state than her and I haven\u2019t been single in over 10 years.  I do a pretty good job of working through my emotions (for a man. Lol jkjk ) the usual random bouts of crying at everything that even remotely touches my soul on a personal level, scrolling tinder, thinking I know what I want even though I can\u2019t muster enough actual energy to being the dating process right now, .... you get the idea.\n\nI\u2019m so lost on a day to day basis, I\u2019ve started new hobbies and have reconnected to as many old friends and new friends as possible. I\u2019m going to be getting a manageable pet (Bearded Dragon) so I can give something what little actual love I can muster right now, and hopefully have myself a little buddy to help me feel better, maybe even talk to, idfk. \n\nI just feel hollow, there\u2019s this woman I\u2019ve been talking to and I\u2019m super into her but I\u2019m questioning wether or not it\u2019s real or if I\u2019m just trying to fill this void as quickly as possible with the first thing that comes along. I\u2019m obviously more into her than she is me and am gonna speak to her about it Sunday when we both have time to figure out what she\u2019s looking for. \n\nI guess I\u2019m just looking for a friend, or a few friends, or someone to talk to about life shit so I can get all this out of me, or 50k people to talk to who all know exactly where I am because they\u2019re either there or they have been before.\n\nIf you\u2019ve made it this far thank you for reading this long ass rant/cry for help. Would love to hear from some of you and maybe start chatting regularly.  I\u2019m curious if anyone has any real good coping mechanism they can share for being lonely as fuck that have helped them get through rough times. \n\nLooking forward to reading and replying to some posts. \ud83d\ude42 \n\ntl;dr : be my friend so I don\u2019t ruin my nonexistent dating life!", "subreddit": "lonely"}

This is the only explanation I have for what some guys are doing. \n\nThis Instagram model has been the subject of large youtubers for a while now. I didn't know she existed until recently when some larger youtubers were talking about what she is doing. She has millions of subs. She has these heavily edited pictures to make her look like some anime character. I don't know much about anime either so feel free to correct me. I've seen Youtube videos talk about how edited photos of some of these Instagram models are where if one of them walked past you in the street, you possibly wouldn't even recognize at least some of them. \n\nWhen I first saw people talking about this woman, I said, she's 15 WTF are people doing but apparently she's over 18. I watched a video last night about her that talks about how she is making thousands of dollars a month, just by taking advantage of guys. Don't get me wrong, she can do whatever she wants but how desperate of a guy do you have to be to do what some of these guys are doing. They give her thousands of dollars on her Patreon to get private photos of her. They tell her how much they love her. She will say if you give my photo on Instagram a certain amount of views or likes, I will do this. Then she trolls them. She's quite intelligent in knowing how to manipulate desperate guys although that's not as difficult as trying to date when you are ugly and autistic, but, she still knows exactly what she is doing with her followers. \n\nI'm on Youtube and see this series of videos talking about her literally selling her bathwater for $30!!!!!!! I thought to myself, she's just trolling. The only people who would buy that would be people just buying it ironically or youtubers who want to get views by buying it then making videos about them buying the bath water. While some did buy it ironically or for commentary purposes, apparently thousands of guys actually bought it unironically! Guys are falling in love with a woman who looks like some anime character due to a combination of makeup and filters. Maybe it's my age but I don't understand why guys are doing this. Maybe there are more FA guys out there than we think who are so desperate, they will literally buy the bath water of some Instagram model they like. This isn't an isolated incident either. \n\nI've heard stories of Instagram models getting to be wealthy just from desperate guys. If they want a vacation they will say they are releasing private Snapchat photos for example and the next day they will have the money. What is going on with guys?\n\nOnce again, I don't blame the Instagram models. They are just taking advantage of a situation where they can profit. I'm also not generalizing all women on Instagram since most just post pictures and have their friends comment on them. I am saying that are there more of us out there than we think?

Currently studying Communications because I guess I\u2019m good at that somehow (ironically a bit too) and hope it will sustain me financially while I test more waters and try to find some decent purpose in life.\n\nAlso probably somewhat antinatalist (yeah real romance material I know) but like not extremely. Idk there\u2019s probably a better word for what I believe with that. Political scale test tells me I lean left and libertarian, but I\u2019m still like -3 authoritarian -5 right. Don\u2019t like to label myself as anything but moderate but also not strictly in the middle according to data. Is this important, I have no idea. Honestly don\u2019t even know if I\u2019m going to end up talking to anyone and just want to introduce myself somewhere. Also worried something about me will be an instant turn-off. Which is fine. Or well, it\u2019s not *really* fine but it\u2019s fine if people feel that way. Does that even make any sense idk. \n\nBut yeah I\u2019m happy to be earnest to someone for a longer period of time. I hope I\u2019m someone I would date. Even if not, welp, hope this was a decent read. Not sure why it would be but I won\u2019t complain (unless you harass me about it I guess but I\u2019m going to assume that\u2019s not happening).\n\nIf this is the wrong sub someone tell my stupid ass so I can delete this btw.", "subreddit": "lonely"}

I used to go to her house every week, (I\u2019ll call her S) she was the only person I hung out with. We were both suicidal, and took cover in eachother. I knew she cared about me. She had to fill out a form at school with one of the counselors for the people who were having suicidal thoughts or not attending school. I saw the form in her room one time, it said \u201cif you\u2019re feeling suicidal, who can you trust and talk to?\u201d My name was the only one on there, so I knew she cared. We would watch movies, take walks, smoke. Some of my best memories were with her... then she got a girlfriend, I\u2019ll call her L. S and I had an unhealthy relationship from the start. I knew she didn\u2019t want to hang out if I didn\u2019t bring weed. After about 4 months of hanging out once or twice a week, I started to get a bad feeing. I knew something was wrong I felt strongly that I knew our friendship would end, I couldn\u2019t explain why I felt it. When she got a girlfriend, she started hanging out with me less. Small details gave it away that she didn\u2019t want to see me as much. All 3 of us had hung out before, I didn\u2019t like L that much but I didn\u2019t mind bring around her. When it came to the end of the day, where we\u2019d watch a movie, they\u2019d be under a blanket and I\u2019d be on the other side of a couch. Nothing I could be too mad about, they\u2019re dating and I have to respect that. But as someone who\u2019s never dated before, it was difficult to sit there, hearing them make out. I sent S a text a few days later about how i felt that she and I had been drifting apart, and that I wished she and I talked more. She didn\u2019t really respond, which is something she does all the time. If she doesn\u2019t like what she sees, she looks the other way and ignores it. So when I say something she doesn\u2019t like, she doesn\u2019t text back. So immature to ignore everything you don\u2019t like, especially when it\u2019s the person who cares about you the most. I had the same feeing in my gut that our friendship was coming to an end, I knew it would be in a week, I just knew. A few days later, I texted her asking if she wanted to hang out, no response. I waited a few days, nothing. I sent another text saying I\u2019m sorry if I upset her, and that her friendship meant a lot to me. No response. I check her Instagram. She deleted all the pictures I took of her on her main, which was like 80% of them. The. I checked her private, and I was blocked. I was in shock, I had helped her through so many scary times in her life. She was going to kill herself, I was there for her. If you\u2019ve ever been there for someone when they\u2019re going through that, you know how stressful and hard It is to comfort them, but I stuck with her. Because that was the right thing to do. When she needed to talk, I was there. I had always been there, I had prided myself on always being loyal and reliable. Then she blocks me in everything and never texts me back. Has anyone else had a similar situation, or any tips on how to cope? I don\u2019t have anyone anymore, and she knew that. What do I do? Any ideas on why she never texted back?", "subreddit": "lonely"}

I\u2019m a full time shift worker so my sleep/wake cycle is completely fucked and I\u2019m almost never, ever free on weekends or evenings because of the nature of my job. Because of this, I\u2019m usually only free during random weekday mornings, and most people my age have regular day jobs so I don\u2019t really have people to hang out with. I\u2019ve never had many friends to begin with. During my years at university I made maybe 5 friends at most, and unfortunately none of the friendships were close. I\u2019ve also never had a romantic relationship of any kind. I tried to remain in contact with some of my uni friends on and off for a few years but all those connections gradually faded. I\u2019m not friends with anyone at work. We\u2019re \u2018friendly\u2019, as professional acquaintances should be, but there\u2019s not a single person I could describe as a friend. On top of this, the kind of job I have involves working by yourself without needing to spend much time interacting with anyone (that\u2019s part of the appeal of the job for me due to my social anxiety and social awkwardness, to be honest). Basically I\u2019m in a situation where I\u2019m in my late 20s, depressed, very lonely, and don\u2019t have very many opportunities to meet and connect with other people. Besides, most people around my age or older are married, have kids, etc., so I don\u2019t come across a lot of people with free time just to hang out with some socially awkward loner who\u2019s almost 30. The whole socially awkward thing I\u2019ve got going on is downright off-putting at my age, where it might have been somewhat cute and endearing in my teens when I actually had a decent circle of friends. I always thought I\u2019d grow out of it, but I didn\u2019t. There are so many things that happen in my life where I find myself just wishing I had someone to talk to about it, or some friends to share experiences with. Unfortunately I feel like that ship has officially sailed. I can\u2019t even imagine a plausible scenario in which I\u2019m ever going to have a close friend again. What bizarre sequence of events would have to happen for someone to end up developing a close connection with *me*? I\u2019m not interesting, I\u2019m not funny, I\u2019m not attractive. It\u2019s almost laughable to think about someone ever being like \u201cu/youarenothing is my best friend\u201d in this lifetime. Forget romantic relationships\u2014 I\u2019ve officially given up on that. If I can\u2019t even make a friend, what are the odds that anyone could ever push past that and actually fall in love with me? Virtually impossible. That\u2019s why I\u2019m now just focused on the lack of friends. That\u2019s what keeps me up at night. It can\u2019t be normal for a person to have literally no friends at all... Conventional wisdom says *everyone* has friends, right? Guess that\u2019s concrete evidence my life is a monumental failure. \n\nAnyway, just wanted to vent.

I just wanted somewhere to rant to that isn't my immediate only two/three people I talk to. I am kinda in a weird situation where I had to leave school for a year and a half, it's really expensive and I'm paying for it myself so I took off to pay off my tuition from last year and save up to go back. A lot has happened since then, I've gotten awesome jobs that pay very well for someone who doesn't have a degree and is just a college kid trying to pay for everything. I'm finally content at my jobs, I've worked some shitty barely minimum wage ones, and I'm happy to say after a year and a half of struggling, I'm better off now.\n\nNow, my personality has always been bubbly and I've always loved people. Its why I work in retail and with people- because even for those 99/100 times where someone is just an asshole (who's entitled and is so frustrated with their own life that they have to harass the hard working people at their local stores and malls to feel better) there is always that 1/100 who remind me why I'm glad humans are social creatures. It reminds me why I'm a med/STEM degree, why I keep bothering with waking up in the morning, and why I can't wait until I graduate so I can help people in an even bigger way then just helping them find clothes, or tools, or serving them food. If I can get you that discount, if I can find a way to make it cheaper for you because you're kind to me and have a special occasion, I will.\n\nBut I'm so so lonely.\n\nI'm engaged to the greatest man I've ever met, my sister, brother and I get along, my fiance's best friend treats me like a little sister, and I have a roommate I consider a brother. But aside from these people, there is no one else. And I try! I try to talk to the girls my age from work, I've even made plans with them and been out with them once, but then those promises of \"we should do this again\" they never happen. Aside from that, most of my other coworkers are way way older than me and are very kind and caring towards me, but they understand that there is a mutual respect going on and they wouldn't wanna hang out with a college kid. They have grandkids my age, it'll be weird to them to consider befriending someone so vastly younger.\n\nAnd today, I've kinda just snapped and broke down into tears in the shower. Yesterday I decided to try and initiate some plans with the two girls I really liked from an old job that I quit, and they said they'll let me know! Well this morning I check their snaps and they just decided to hang out without me and I'm just devastated.\n\nI just want someone to talk to and hang out with that isn't a male, my family is far away since I decided to go to college far away and I feel so lonely. It's like everyone forgets about me, if I run into you on the street I get hugs and kisses and everyone is so ecstatic to see me! But it's the keeping up the constant contact, or even just reaching out to me no one does. Even when I run into people who claim they miss me beyond words and all that, as soon as I text them hey let's do something! I get left on read or they never get back to me.\n\nAm I cursed? Why doesn't anyone want to be my friend, I feel like I am boring my fiance and family with these complaints, and I don't want to be a nuisance. I started working out to pass the time, I've been suffering from an injury though so its hard but I'm determined to start running again. I loved running. I go to therapy to talk about all my bad experiences so I try to keep any emotional outbursts to a minimum, but holy fuck dude it's hard to keep going when it's this fucking lonely. My fiance is out of the country, his best friend/my (nonblood) brother is out of the state, my siblings are on the opposite side of the country, and my roommate/(nonblood) brother is here obviously but I can't keep just hanging out with him and crying about the same problems. I don't know what to do and I keep crying and I feel so awful about my existence.\n\nI feel like life is in a loop of work, eat, sleep, and it feels so empty sometimes. I just wish I had other people I had a deep connection to where I can make plans, celebrate my birthday with them, a surprise party maybe- I dunno! I turned 21 this year and no one wished me a happy birthday aside from the few mentioned here. And even then, no one wanted to see me anyway.", "subreddit": "lonely"}

My depression usually gets worse when I develop a crush on someone, something that happens around two months after I successfully forget the last unachievable crush. The last case was a colleague of mine in college, a girl that was actually a quite good friend to me. Crush developed, never found the balls to talk to ber, and realized some other sad things about the whole deal, and I get *really fucking depressed*, shit was pretty bad. \n\nI realized that seeing her and interacting made me feel awful, and it got worse because she was a good friend and wanted to talk to me pretty much everytime we saw each other. But the problem was that I couldn't do that because she was literally in ALL my obligatory classes in college. But then, a small miracle happened: due to a pretty complex administrative problem in said college our obligatory classes were not offered this semester. So I had a semester full of optional classes full of people I never saw before. \n\nAnd after a while I just started feeling better, completely erased any old feelings about her. I honestly forget she exists most of the time. The great part is that no other crush appeared to take that place, I've been free for almost six months now! It's the first time in many years I had such a break. \n\nNot only that, I started seeing a psychologist to treat my mental issues, which got way worse after my dad passed away last year, and started to practice a quite strict diet and, after going through the worst part of it, already lost 10 pounds (I'm aiming to lose 40). I've had some time to read great books that I enjoyed greatly.\n\nFor the first time in a long time I feel... Happy.\n\nOk, so why did come here to say all that?

However, I desperately need one, especially since my parents would not approve of me living the life I want and I need a partner to help me through it.\n\nI come from a South Asian Muslim background. Islam is a harsh religion and I no longer believe in it. South Asian culture is even worse. It is full of stupidity and contains heavily parental control of adult children. You can see r/ExMuslim for more info.\n\nHowever, my parents / family are the only form of love I have. To have them accept me however, I have to conform to their norms. Within a couple of years, they will try to get me married in the traditional South Asian Muslim arranged marriage fashion. This is not an FA escape though, as 1) I won't be able to live the life I want and 2) there is no love as such in a south Asian arranged marriage.\n\nIf I come out as an ex-Muslim, it will not go well. I need a partner for this sort of support. To give me an emotional support to live the life I desire. But since I am unable to find love, I am stuck where I am, living a lie so that my parents may love me. But their love is in some ways conditional. To them, me leaving Islam is like if I robbed a bank - they will love me but not really through the hurt and shame. A partner is the bridge I need to be able to be honest w/ my parents and to live the life I want. If only I could get that...", "subreddit": "ForeverAlone"}

(15f) I am always the one to go up to people, always the one to text first, always the one to invite people, always upbeat, happy, energetic, and sweet, and still I have not one friend I could text in my freetime or talk to casually. All i really want is a friend. Just one.", "author": "Comrade_Danielle", "self_text": "It's a long thing. and it's really affecting my mental health. Like REALLY. So I'll start.\n\nOkay... I'm 15, going to tenth grade. I am an orthodox jew, straight, and currently work 5 days a week as a counselor at a summer religious day camp from 8:30 to 4:00. I have been to private school all my life, not religious or jewish, but private school. Just giving background info. I'm probably depressed, I self harm, see a therapist (who does nothing, by the way), have been emotionally and probably physically abused (don't know what constitutes physical abuse but ive been slapped hard on the face, kicked down the stairs, and hit against the wall multiple times). I've been called a piece of shit, piece of trash, waste of oxygen, bitch, fucking bitch, stupid kid, idiot, as well as numerous other names... but don't worry about it please... this isn't the point of this post.\n\nI have bad social anxiety, so much that I run out of classrooms when i have to present, and start shaking and sweating when i am called on. I never raise my hand but a couple times i was called on and i started violently shaking, looked down, and mumbled *i dont know* even if i did know, im too stressed out to answer. I don't work well in big groups of people, crowds terrify me, but 10 or less people I can deal with and be normal with.\n\nI also have maladaptive daydreaming. I won't get into it now because it will be important later. It's a type of dissociation and coping mechanism thingy, but it's a bad coping mechanism. Hence the word maladaptive, which means:\n\n&gt;not providing adequate or appropriate adjustment to the environment or situation.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;*\"maladaptive coping strategies such as increasing consumption of alcohol\"*\n\nIt is where i create a world in my head that doesn't exist, I have imaginary friends, an imaginary self, and i live in a perfet utopia where i have all that I want. It's like a subconscious yearning i have for that reality, for friends and for a better me, and just a better life, and there's so many things stopping me from getting it in reality so that I daydream about it. the dreaming is about 60% of my waking life, it involves pacing nonstop in circles, talking to myself, and making facial expressions. To other people I look like a psycho but in my head I'm pretending im other people having conversations. Occasionally i burst out laughing in public out of nowhere and people are like what's so funny, but what happened is that I daydreamed someone said or did something funny in my head. I try to not show it in public but sometimes i zone out and can't control it. My dreams are mainly me having fun with friends. It's a complex world only I can understand, and it'll only give *me* the pleasure it gives me while doing it because i am deprived of and have different wants than most other people my age, if that makes any sense.\n\n\\---\n\nEnough background info. But it was important. So, like, if you skipped over it, go back and read it.\n\nSo I try hard to make friends. I am extremely eager and i have a really immature, goofy personality but not an annoying one. I stop when people tell me to. I like doing pranks, i take things easily, i dont get angry or sad or dramatic. and if someone needs help ill gladly run to help them with anything. I always go up to people. I have to interrupt them even sometimes so that they'll notice me.I text them but I've never recieved a text message from anyone. I have never in my life of 15 years been invited to the beach, mall, or any kind of casual outing by anyone ever. Last week I texted 10 people i thought were my friends even though they have lots of other friends. I invited them to the mall and i planned everything out. There was a movie theater, bowling alley, and roller skating rink. A movie i wanted to see started at 11 so i started the outing at 11, in case we wanted to watch a movie. I figured we'd have lunch so i looked up all the restaurants. I gave everyone the directions, things to do, and I felt this awesome feeling. I never get out of my house. NEVER. I NEVER talk to people. NEVER NEVER EVER.\n\nAbout 5 people said they could come. I was really excited.\n\nOne cancelled a couple of days before saying they actually couldn't make it.\n\nThe rest of the people i texted everyday from that day reminding them and talking about how excited i was.\n\nThe day of the trip I got up extremely early and fixed my hair and spent like hours choosing an outfit. I ate a really good wholesome breakfast and i was feeling really good, like as if even for 3 hours i could pretend to be normal and live the life like the way i do when im in my head talking to myself. With friends, but like real ones.\n\nSo then I got into the car.\n\nAll of them said they were so sorry they couldn't make it. Except one.\n\nI felt extremely down but i texted the last friend, the one i was hoping would come the most out of all of them. I even changed the date to the day he said he could make it on. It was like 20 mins til it started. I texted him 'are you excited?? have you started driving??\"He texted: \"wait what r we doing again?\"\n\nand so i got confused and sent him all the details again. I had been bothering him for days about it since i planned it. He said:\n\n\"Oh sorry, im going to the beach with \\_\\_, and \\_\\_\\_, and \\_\\_. I'm so sorry i hope you have fun.\"\n\nBut.... he had told me he had nothing planned on that day. So then I just asked my mom to drive to my dad's office where i go sometimes. there's a mattress and a pillow in one of the empty office rooms. I like to sleep there and daydream. It's a depressing room though. later that day he posted a photo on instagram, and a few videos. he was with all the kids hiking in LA by the hollywood sign ( we live close to LA) and then they were in this gorgeous beach by the sunset that I'd only see in my dreams. And they were on top of this mountain and the view and everyone looked like they were having fun and he captioned it 'i had so much fun today, you guys are the best most amazing and funny friends ever!!'\n\nGuys im done with making friends.\n\nYesterday I invited my other 'friend' that never talks to me unless i talk to her and i was super eager and like do you want to go to the amusement park and we can go on the roller coasters and stuff?? Obviously she said no. I was so excited.\n\nThen i go on instagram and see everyone in other countries and everyone having fun and shopping and eating out and going to amusement parks and im here with a bunch of crying third graders all day in the hot sun only to get home to 'you piece of shit get to your room right now but first clean all the dishes'.\n\nand then I'm up until 2 o clock in the morning pacing in circles in my room imagining everything about me and my 'friends' and my life was completely different. I haven't left the house for a fun outing with friends since 6th grade, almost 4 years ago. And even that time i had to invite myself.\n\nI wish someone would invite me somewhere. And put thought into the planning, and what well do and how excited they are to see me. I'm always so excited to meet people and i always tell them how much i miss them but no one ever responds and no one ever tells me they enjoy being with me.\n\nI wish i had even just one person to be goofy with and go out, maybe we could do the things i spend my life dreaming about, 8 hrs a day, just dreaming... maybe we could just like laugh and go to the beach and go eat out and maybe we could go roller skating or get ice cream sundaes or go hiking or just like take a walk in town and go to the library or something... or we could go shopping in santa monica, a really lively nice city in the evening, there's street jazz bands and ice skating... I've only been there once as a child but occasionally dream about it in my dreams. ANd then we could go to the coffee shop and get something to drink and sit outside and just chat.I WANT SOMEONE to look into my eyes when they talk to me, not ignore me, not pull out their phone, not walk away, I want them to look in my eyes and pay attention to what i say and i want them to have fun being with me cause i have fun with everyone but no one has fun with me, everyone thinks im boring. And i want someone lively, not depressed like everyone else my age. And someone that will just send me random text messages, i wish someone would send me hi. I wish someone would tell me hi and then send like a smiley face emoji. I wish someone would facetime me. I haven't facetimed in years and i have never received a facetime call from anyone.\n\nI wish i could escape my home with someone and just go somewhere simple, like just take a walk, and i want to be comfortable with them and just be me, not mentally ill, not abused, not depressed, not covered in scars, not wearing long dresses and long sleeves and shirts that cover my collarbone (because of religion, im extremely religious tho i dont want to be) just i want to be normal and do normal things like a normal kid my age and forget everything that's going on just for 3 hours of my life. With someone who actually enjoys my presence and isnt looking away or responding 'oh' or 'yeah' to something i say. I don't party, never kissed or hooked up, never vaped or smoked, im not a social media addict, i dont bring my phone or look at it when i talk to people, im not a slutty hoe-girl, idk......... i just want to have easygoing, sweet, responsible empathetic friends. or just one.\n\nNext year im going to public school. A new school. I dont know a single soul there. I have a chance to change things, change my personality, make new friends.\n\nI need help so i dont ruin everything on the first day. Again, I DON\"T do well in crowds.\n\nTLDR i want friends. Help, im going mentally insane. I already am actually.\n\nLITERALLY YOU GUYS all i want is a friend.\n\n\\*\\*shuts of reddit and proceeds to pace in circles whilst laughing, making weird facial expressions, and mumbling to myself, you think i look like a psycho but im actually just having a picnic in the park with my imaginary friends\\*\\*", "subreddit": "lonely"}

What happens if you hesitate for so long, so anxious about wasting it, that when you finally pull trigger: nothing happens?\n\nYour chance was invalid before you even began. The deck stacked against you. The gambit was in play before you even realized that there was no way out. You cherished the notion that at the right time and place, you could suddenly fulfill yourself! You would feel purposeful, intent on completing what you set out to do. And yet, you aimed at what you wanted, and now you\u2019re overwhelmed without a single point of salvation available.\n\nThere\u2019s no escape rope, no teleport, there\u2019s no quick exit, no wings to spread and fly. It\u2019s just you and the crushing darkness of what you tried to run from all catching up to you.\n\nI\u2019m 25, and soon I\u2019ll be 26. I don\u2019t see myself making it long past 30. Every year after I graduated college, I told myself that *this* would be the year. I\u2019d figure my path out, I\u2019d find what I was looking for. I\u2019d finally be able to relax. Maybe you\u2019re younger, and you feel the same. Hell, this misery know no stranger, and there are those older who probably suffer, too! Just the same, my mind wanders to thoughts of how things could have been different.\n\nI missed all of my chances. Any opening I had at my dreams has long passed me by. I\u2019ve put the gun to my head and pulled the trigger but even then it didn\u2019t fire. The powder was wet, the bullet tarnished, the mechanism rusty from disuse; moreso, the thing doesn\u2019t even look like it was built to fire in the first place. \n\nI was born faulty. I was not made properly. Who here can say they were? But many of us have the troublesome mental afflictions that make the game seem rigged from the start. When you fear existence itself, are you meant to keep existing? Maybe your family thinks so, or you could be unlucky and have them wish you would stop being a bother. Maybe you don\u2019t know, or perhaps you feel they\u2019re lying to your face. You can say \u201cNo worries,\u201d but do you mean it? \n\nI\u2019m on the Spectrum. The blasted Spectrum. I\u2019m quite alright with it, but you\u2019d be hard pressed to find someone who is willing and able to deal with a stranger who is afflicted. I\u2019m a handful, even on the best of days. My usefulness is limited, my personality grating, my appearance shabby, and my interests absurd. But I\u2019m still human. *Right?* I hope I am, but it\u2019s not easy to feel that way sometimes.\n\nThe rest of my family are wonderfully average. *Dare I say above average?* My father is an engineer, as is my uncle. My mother, a nurse, my aunt an experienced legal assistant. My sister is a physicians assistant, my cousins both wonderful people trying to start their careers as they finish out college. My sister is older than I am, and I got to watch as she quit a 6 year relationship and found someone better, with whom she is quite happily living her life. Their relationship is enviable. My younger cousin has found a boyfriend who has quickly bonded with her and is moving to engagement, much to the delight of my family. My other cousin is recovering from a motorcycle accident and will finish school soon. And I... well...\n\nI\u2019ve discovered that I burnt my chances out long ago. As an Aspie, I struggled to fit in during middle and high school. I was bullied. I was used. I was neglected. And I ended up becoming very scared of people due to this experience. I found myself retreating to the edges and the corners, relating with teachers and adults to avoid the unforgiving others my age. I exited school with no friends, other than a small group of three people I found in an online forum before I discovered that the bullying and abuse existed on the internet, too. I stopped exploring and being excited about the Web once I got berated for simply enjoying a game I liked. *Nobody cares,* indeed.\n\nI went to college and never found my place there. I kept presenting myself for usage, because it\u2019s all I knew about interacting with others. I could do project work, I could find things online easily, I was knowledgeable in certain areas, and when it came to games, I had a lot of cool things to offer. But I rarely got taken up on any of that, and despite hating how I felt being used for what I could do and nothing else, it was a lonely time. Even the campus\u2019 religious groups largely ignored me if I visited. I struggled to make it through, and got depressed and suicidal. I got pulled through it by medicine and awkward discussions with doctors who didn\u2019t know what to do. And for a time, I felt my greatest achievement was getting my degree. The other option was death. I couldn\u2019t fail... it wasn\u2019t an option.\n\nI quickly realized that death would have been better. My degree wasn\u2019t in Science, but in Arts... a business degree in a field that didn\u2019t care for business. I found myself locked out of jobs due to lack of experience, lack of clearance, lack of education, lack of certification. I took the first job I could find and then quickly looked for friends.

I'm happy for u/PleasurableButtStuff and jealous of his success. His post just caused me to remember when I was 25. I was at my social peak. I had friends, some of them were women who actually wanted to hang out with me which was rare for me, and all of them told me I would be escaping FA before I turned 26. Ironically, when I was 20, a woman friend predicted I was going to find a woman when I was 26. Since I was 20, I wasn't worried about being FA. I was concerned due to my lack of experience but I had convinced myself I was a late bloomer and my friends at the time agreed. \n\nAt 25 I was in good physical shape. I went to the gym multiple times a week. I actually did not try online dating yet. I was going out multiple times a week to meet people. The friends I did make were through a hobby group. Yes, the meme advice worked for me and I had friends who were interested in similar things to me. \n\nI sit here at a new low because every day I wake up is a new low. Every day I go to my job is a new low. Most people have a social peak and most people peak in their 20's. By your 30's you are settling down, getting married, and having kids. Your social circle shrinks to include other married people. If chad's peak was Mt. Everest, average guy's peak was Mt. Kosciuszko(shout out to the Aussies on here), and unattractive guy's peak was Mt. Wycheproof(smallest mountain in the world is in Australia so another shout out to them), my peak at 25 was a fucking anthill. The problem is, the anthill looks high up when you are looking at it from halfway down the Mariana Trench. \n\nI can't take it anymore. Why I do have to wake up? I will go to work tomorrow and work with my chad coworker again. While he may not have a great job, his model looking girlfriend is rapidly gaining social status at her internship. I will get to watch how normal people interact. I'm a spectator in normal life. I only get to watch them at work or when I go out on my own. I went to a diner today and saw how normal people interact with each other. \n\nDo you know what it's like to be this age and have people literally half your age lecturing you on how to escape FA? Do you know how it feels to be told you didn't try hard enough or nitpick everything you did wrong by someone who was a bulge in her pregnant mom's belly when you were in high school getting bullied every day? I hold back my anger with them. I'm sitting here at midnight drinking a Monster because I don't fucking know and it's probably not healthy. I don't give a shit. \n\nI don't think I can take another birthday. I don't have anyone to talk to since therapists here seem to be obsessed with politics. You are all I have. I'm sure some outsider will tell me how I can't accept being FA and should never give up. I'm sure they will assume my current personality is the one I've always had. They will say, people can sense your negativity. I don't give a shit. Some of these people are so full of themselves, if it turns out they do some pleasurable stuff to their butt when they look at their own picture, it wouldn't surprise me. Funny name. \n\nIt's never going to happen for me. Why can't I move on? I still think about women. I still fantasize about women. I don't want to because it just makes it hurt worse. By fantasize I don't even mean sexually but in a companionship way doing things like sitting together watching a movie. That hurts more than not having sex. I constantly think about if I did one thing differently, I would be married to a wonderful woman, financially secure living in a house with two kids by now. Maybe if I was able to control my stupid autistic personality more, I wouldn't have ended up where I'm at. \n\nI'm never going to be one of those guys who pays for some Instagram model's bath water or premium Snapchat pictures. As pathetic as that is, you need to actually think someone will like you and they will want to get with you. I don't even get used anymore because they have nothing to gain from me. \n\nMy existence is meaningless and I don't know how many more times I can continue to wake up in the morning like this. I'm not saying I'm going to do anything to myself but sometimes I wish  the assisted version of that was legal. What do you do when you have lost at everything? What do you do when it's too late to get back up? What do you do when you want to accept FA but there is always a part of you that can't? What the fuck do I do with myself anymore? It's more of a rhetorical question so the outsider saying something specific isn't what I'm going for.\n\nIf anyone got to the end, you must have lots of patience. \n\nTl;dr: Things suck", "subreddit": "ForeverAlone"}

{"post_id": "c9safd", "created_utc": 1562410094, "title": "How do I stop hating myself for not making myself a social life in college?", "author": "ranji_shabnam", "self_text": "I went to 3 different elementary schools (2 in TX, 1 in CA), 1 middle school (in CA - which was in the same school district as the CA elementary school), and 2 high schools (in NJ and MD). Overall, it somewhat makes sense I have no one I can communicate with on a regular basis - I only had a handful of distant friends I would see from family parties. In high school, I had \\~5-6 classroom friends - I was invited to a birthday and graduation party, and had a small graduation party.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIn CA, I made a good friend who I would email with on a regular basis throughout my high school years - when college started, she stopped contacting. After looking through her social media, it seems like she got \"wilder\" (i.e., go drinking, partying, wear heavy makeup, wear less conservative fashion, etc.) during college - so it might have been natural dwindling from her side. I reached out to her in sophomore year of college...but after one night of texting she never reached out again. I just looked over our email threads recently, and boy did I mess up - I think  a few times she didn't respond to my email...so for periods of time I wouldn't respond to her email for months if I felt the conversation \"ended\" - I should have waited a couple of weeks during the few times she didn't respond to my emails; still I am happy over our 4 years there was contact.\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\nFlash forward to college - I believed the clubs/classes were cliquey throughout...but as I am about to graduate with my B.S. in electrical engineering this summer, I came up with an epiphany: it was my fault. Students follow the 4-year plan given to them by advisors - they can see the same people over and over again; whenever I listened to advisors (for 2 semesters) I failed classes so I invented my own schedules - I \\*never\\* failed classes when I made my own schedules (for 8 semesters).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI learned, after it was too late, that when it comes to making friends in college clubs you have to go to as many events as possible as a freshman, before cliques settle in; I should have done that in either my freshman or sophomore year of college (since it took me 5 years to graduate). Anyways, I was miserable over my college major (my parents said if I don't become an engineer I will never find a good job) so I spent majority of the time freaking out/procrastinating in my dorm/apartment and doing homework - if I could go back in time I would try to become more active in a religious organization or engineering sorority/organization. Even if I had 1-3 other friends to keep in touch with I would be fine; everyone has a million classroom friends, a million friends to hang out with, and a thriving social life after graduation - either by seeing high school/childhood friends by moving near their hometowns, or by moving near their college friends (I went to a major flagship state university, which is not terribly far from 2 major national cities).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAfter I failed my 4th class in college (end of my 3rd year) I had a nervous breakdown over summer break - I talked to myself in my sleep, didn't eat for a few months, had a little bit of alopecia, and lost my period. I drove my mom and dad mad, my mom forced me to buy a circuit kit, and I reviewed my circuits course material over summer break. I retook circuits  (my 4th failed class) and got an A; ever since then I never repeated a class...even when my father passed away during my college years. I made half of my classroom friends after I failed circuits the first time.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIn college, I had only one friend who I would hang out with a few times a semester - turns out she doesn't have much of a social life in college either. She's special - I opened up to her about my father's passing in the middle of college and my dysfunctional family; she opened up to me about finding it stressful to work and study full-time and become independent, her lack of college social life, her therapy visits, and her dysfunctional family. This is the first time I have \\*ever\\* found a friend I can trust with about anything. I would love to keep in touch with her...but I don't think it will happen - she is already focused on working and trying to be independent, and she doesn't have a car yet and I don't drive on freeways yet - so we can't visit each other. However, went I sent her a FB message saying I appreciated her friendship since it was special and unique for me, she responded back that I was one of her closest friends in life.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIn college, I made \\~10-12 classroom friends (i.e., talk to each other in classes, do homework together, study for exams together, and send each other notes/files/assignments/exams from previous semesters) - irony is I made more of them after I repeated so many courses. There are a couple of girls who live in the same county as me, and we have invited each other to hang out very few times over 2-3 semesters (I could have seen them more if I was more active in my religious organization - I should have done that from the \\*very\\* start in either freshman or sophomore years) and we have carpooled together to/from campus - irony is I never would have had that if my father was still alive. Yes, I know religious organizations/engineering sororities are cliquey as well, but at least the people are less wild compared to other social clubs.\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\nI could easily spend time cleaning up our house and helping my mom...but I am grumpy, lethargic and waste time seeing all these active social lives on Facebook, Instagram...even Venmo (as pathetic as it sounds).  After my summer online class ends this Saturday, I promised myself I would try to help out my mom more, maybe pick up some freeway driving lessons...and maybe visit the gym (to lose some weight) after my mom is pleased I am helping her out more. I hate how my high school and college assignments made me miserable - one side of the world revolved around getting decent grades, another side of the world revolved around everything else. In college, if I wasn't miserable over being invisible I was miserable over my college course work.\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\nAt social events (all throughout 23.5 years of my life), my mind either freezes up or intimate friendships/cliques have been already formed - it feels like no one cares about my existence - everyone follows around the bubbly/quirky/witty folks - I can never smile and converse unless my heart believes the other person likes me - the only \"good\" thing I bring to a friendship is a naturally peaceful aura if I believe someone likes me (I am not quirky/witty/bubbly - people have admitted to me I have a soothing/calming/peaceful presence - but who the hell ever wants that when there is fun?) - I don't know how to put myself out there; I hate that I discovered to late about putting myself out there more in college - half of me feels I was too scared it wouldn't work out so I just said \"screw this - try to pass your difficult classes in this major your parents said would set you up for life\"; I still justify my behavior at times, genuinely believing it wouldn't have worked out either way. Half of me believes I didn't put myself out there in college since I was invisible in primary schools and family gatherings, half of me believes I didn't put myself out there because I hated my classes and overreacted over how hard they were. Now I will spend the rest of my life alone...just over \"What if I still failed and hated myself even more? What if I had only 1-2 successes?\"\n\nI still believe if people weren't social, I would felt better about myself and would not care about my lack of social life - with my father's recent passing (I watched him die from a massive cardiac arrest when I was 22 - I spent my last moments with him) I still am under my mom's roof (we all depended on my father for everything)...but hopefully I can become independent. College is the last place to form friendships, and I fucked that up due to various factors - cliques are universal everywhere. Half of me believes no one will miss me if I die, half of me believes I can distract myself by improving myself - that is easier than seeing a cliquish planet Earth, and bursting into tears since everyone values chatterboxes.\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\nPlease give me advice on how to love myself being a lone wolf - I hate wasting time on my phone, pigging out at home, laying around in bed, crying and screaming...and hearing my mom rightfully complain about running a household (I hope to become more active once I finish this online summer class today). I am destined to be alone my whole life (forget finding a husband) - help me find peace. I can never find someone who will text me 24/7, never find people to hang out with once a month (I live in a middle-class suburb that is not a major city), and never find lifelong friends to catch up/visit occasionally - I don't know if it came from me moving around frequently, making horrible first impressions, or being too scared/miserable in college. I can't continue feeling miserable/lethargic my whole life - what have all of you done to feel happy as lone wolves?", "subreddit": "lonely"}

In a month, I'll have been sober for 2 years. I feel like I should be celebrating life right now but I can't help but feel an overwhelming sadness. I have no friends, I dumped my boyfriend in February and I've felt mostly great until now. It's given me  a chance to learn more about who I am and what I like as an individual. With that being said, I am having a hard time figuring out if this is me isolating myself out of necessity or, if I am actually just depressed. I go to work and that's the only real reason I engage with people, I'm a bartender.  In my free time, I just spend that at home. I often will have 2 or 3 days off a week and won't even leave my house unless it involves running errands. Hell, I won't even answer my door for a door dasher, they call, I tell them I'm in the shower and they leave my order at the front door. I used to be all over the place, surrounded by people and when I decided to get sober, I cut everyone off. I needed to do that. It's past that now though...I can't relate to my peers past a surface level, I feel like an alien. I feel like a ghost too.  The only people who talk to me are guys who DM  me on instagram. I come to reddit because I'm alone. I haven't planned to do anything for my birthday because what do you do to celebrate you 30th birthday when you're alone? I've had a few guys offer to take me out to celebrate but I just don't have it in me to muster up a smile out in the world outside of my house if it doesn't involve getting paid to do so. I'm torn because half of me feels like I'm on the right path but the other half of me is unsure. I've never been alone like this before and although I think it's necessary in order to grow, there are moments when I need to talk to someone and there is nobody for me to do that with.  You can't help but notice that sort of thing...I'm trying my best to snap out of this funk I'm in. I try to allow myself to do the things that I want and need to do for myself to function optimally through out my days. I'm just drained. I just want a friend. I'm thankful for my dog, there isn't anyone more pumped to see me than him, ever. I'm sorry that my post is so negative, I guess I just needed to release something.

We were best friends.  We used to do everything together.  Now we just exist in the same house and occasionally argue.  Living with roomates makes it even worse.  He has a bit of a temper and I have spent too long putting my head down and trying to remedy his problems.  I get yell at for stupid things all the time.  I feel like he doesn't care about me or anything I like.  He gets mad when I correct him.  He gets mad at his video games.  He gets mad at our cats.  Mad at his job.  I grew up in a violent household and I really hate yelling or when he starts throwing his phone or hitting stuff, I've tried to explain why I get emotional when he raises his voice with me and then I get yelled at for being sad.\n\n  He makes me feel like a failure.  I work more hours (3 jobs), but make less than him so he has the financial power.  Despite working more I also am the only one to clean or care for our animals which I get yelled at for not doing enough. I feel more like a maid or a mom than a partner.  And the worst part is I now know I am so much smarter than him.  I don't really understand why I painted myself into this corner of enabling bad behavior.  He's like a kid that throws tantrums.  Honestly I used to get scared but now I feel enraged by the ignorance of ir all like watching a monkey sling poo, it's just stupid and primative to get as mad as he does.\n\nAnd all that has made me feel so alone.  I can't talk to him because he gets mad or accuses me of making up stuff that didn't  happen when it is about  his behavior (more like he smokes so much pot he forgets what he does).  We also live with 2 male roommates and it causes a lot of stress because he gets jealous over stupid things.  Like last winter my battery died and my roomate tave my car a jump.  I had to get gas because my tank was near empty too but I didn't want to go alone in a blizzard with a car that had not started 10 minutes prior.  He refused to go.  Too much effort.  He had an attitude, so my roomie offered to go.  When I got back you would have thought I rode in on the guy naked, my BF was pissed because I 'CHOSE' another man over him to help me.    He gets mad when I talk to them too sometimes.  I feel like I am just supposed to sit in my room and wait for him to come home because setting at the table talking to the people we live with is not always okay...\n\nI finally feel like my life is coming together.  I am out of my druggie parent's house.  I am working 3 jobs and just got offered a promotion.  Still I don't know if it enough to get a place on my own.  Still I don't know if he will break my stuff or hurt our cats if I leave.  Still I have no one to talk to because he won't hear me, my family is way worse, and the only person that acts nice to me ever (roomie from the jump) gets me yelled at because my BF is jealous.", "subreddit": "lonely"}

I have always had a fight within myself about love, more so intimate love, romance that sort of stuff. Half of me thinks I am better off alone while the other half wants it more than ever especially now that I am almost halfway through 43 and see myself getting older. Some days wanting it wins while other days being alone wins but it seems when wanting it wins, it hits me hard.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo this morning while laying in bed it hit me hard and it started out with me thinking about my faith. I believe in the lord above at one point in my life you could say I had the beliefs of an athiest but that changed about ten to fifteen years ago. While I was thinking it came to me in the form of a chess board where I thought this whole game, the game of life is rigged from the start. It might not be for you but it definately is for me. first off the lord removed my mom who left when I was three and outside of sporadic vists throughout my life was never in it. He or if your a feminist she replaced it with my stepmother who from the age of 4 to the age of 12 abused me. She put my head through a wall, beat me with a belt so hard it left welts across my ass, legs, and back. You the readers are the first to hear this outside of my sister who is 7 years older and adopted by my father. Lets get this out of the way before anything else, I am the middle child, my sister is seven years younger and is the product of my ex stepmothers first marriage. My dad adopted her so she  became my adopted sister. I am the product of my dads first marriage and then I have an asshole younger brother who was conditioned to believe the abuse of my sister and I never happened. He and I dont talk because of alot of reasons but he is the result of my dad and stepmother so he is my half brother.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo I was beaten with a belt, my head was put through a wall, made a nice hole that my dad had to spackle and since my father was a cop a patrolman for the city I live in worked shift work so my step mom had plenty of time to do her thing, the punching the taking me by  the ears and slamming my head into the floor. I dont know why this happened but she used to take a blanket at night when I was sleeping and put it over herself like a ghost and come into my room and start punching me telling me my real mom is dead this went on from the age of 4 till the age of maybe 8. It was so strange that I had to ask my sister did this really happen and she told me I was correct in it. My mind blacked or blocked it out until my late twenties or early thirties.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWith all that and my mom not being in my life I had issues. I was raised from the age of 12 to 18 by my grandmother on my dads side who became a mother to me but being from Poland and being raised in a hard fashion because my great grandparents migrated over here in the early 1900's she wasnt a person I could talk to about girls thats a mothers job so I was a late bloomer. I gained alot of weight at the time and was very shy and never talked to girls in high school, I didnt date anyone until my early twenties when I met someone online, this would be 1998 so I was 22 if my math is correct. I was in a long distance relationship that lasted till early 2001. We broke up because that is when my problems started, it started with insomnia which I already had as a teenager but bbecame more frequent to the point I would go days without sleep then collapse during the day and sleep and to this day I still have the problem. My depression really started to come out in the form of bi-polar and because of that we broke up, I had proposed to her at Christmas time and it was over by the summer of 2001. There where two things that kicked my depression off that I have failed to mention 1. My best friend who lived down the street from me committed suicide in 1997, that was the first time that I ever lost someone who was close to me. In 2000 my grandmother who raised me died. Which leads to August of 2001 when my mom died from a massive heart attack. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAround  this time I was still had athiest beliefs but I bargained with the lord above and told him that I was fine with him taking my mother but my father and I were close and dont take him. In 2003 my dad had open heart surgery where he had a quadruple bypass, I remember going to the church chapel and praying to the lord above please dont take my father and at that point he heard me, my dad recovered but late in 2004 my dad was told he had cancer, liver cancer to be exact after a lengthy fight my dad died in July of 2005 and on that day something happened that was the last time I ever felt loved. Its been almost fourteen years now and I am 43 and have said to my shrink if the average is to live till 80 I cant see myself doing this for another 40 years I mine as well end it all now and people dont realize that I am okay with my mortality soon as you mention suicide or offing yourself oh well we cant have that we need to put you on a 72 hour hold and feed you pills to fix the problem.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI went to the doctor at the beginning of last year 2018 and said doc I feel very lethargic I used to weigh over 400lbs I hid it well because I am 6'5 but I lost alot of it by walking to the point I was at 250 and then when I became introverted I gained 25lbs right now I sit at around 275 and so I told the doc I have no energy and I am feeling depressed about it that I am seriously introverted to the point I have no friends outside of the apartment I live in he said well it seems like you have anxiety so here take this pill that should fix it. Middle of last year, doc I still have all the same problems plus my sleep is still fucked up. Okay well continue taking your depression meds at that dose along with the anxiety medicine and now heres a stronger dose of trazadone 150mgs. I should tell you I take cymbalta 60mgs, and a 30mg tab in the morning for depression, wellbutrin 300mg in the morning for anxiety, trazadone 150mg for sleep. And now in 2019 I take depakote 500mg all in the hopes that I dont off myself but its totally okay for me to not have any energy and feel like a vegetable on a daily basis. I support that if people want to end it all they should be allowed to. Its there life, for me I feel like I am broken, I self mutilate (cut) its not everyday but on the days I cant cope I do but doctors think that all this is fixable with medicine there's a pill to fix this though it causes this and this so we need to give you another pill to fix that to me it doesnt make sense my opinion is if you dont want to be here than that's fine with my as long as you dont take anyone with you. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhen my ex fiance broke it off with me it was all about me starting on this journey with my problems after she broke it off I got it stuck in my head that no one would want me like this, and to this day I feel like this so for the last twenty years I never had a serious relationship and now that I am 43 I see all the time that was wasted and the fact that I will never have kids which at one point I wanted. My opinion is love will never find me, its not out there for someone like me as many times as I have prayed on it to this day I cant get it I feel the lord above doesnt love me either. Like I said I havent felt loved since 2005 and if I dont find it why should I be here? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSorry this was so long, there was so much I wanted to get out, hopefully I gave you the reader some talking points.

I said no because it's less of a mouth full. Stating this up front just in case.\n\nAnyway, I'm a 19 y/o male, with high functioning autism. I'm relatively thin, and I'd say I'm about average in the looks department and I have an average height. I don't have a girlfriend but I do have a single friend, let's call him Cole, he is my best friend, and according to him, I am his best friend. He is an extrovert, he enjoys going to party's, has a girlfriend, and tons of friends. \n\nTo get to the point, Cole has quite a few interests, he enjoys videogames, he tinkers with electrical engineering, he has many animals that he raises and breeds in order to sell, and he enjoys making and editing music and videos, and many other stuff. In contrast, I have two interests, I like videogames and I have a special interest in pure mathematics. \n\nWhich was the observation that first made me think about this topic. My sense of humor can be summed up with \"dry with a tinge of puns\", whenever I am talking to anyone other than Cole, I'm incredibly quiet boardering on not talking at all.

For people who already are, hey, you'll resonate with this post even more. Now, in this world where you are lactose intolerant, be it this world or the imaginary one, imagine for me that everyone *else* is able to have ice cream.\n\nThis post is specifically about ice cream, not other dairy or cheese products, but, bear with me, I *promise* that this has a purpose here. Imagine for one moment that this world has entirely focused itself on the advertisement, propagation, and production of ice cream.\n\nEveryone constantly talks about how they love ice cream. Everyone also talks about their last time they had ice cream, and when they're gonna next get ice cream, and how they can't wait until they next get another lick of that sweet vanilla/banana/whatever flavour atop a waffle cone, or just in a bowl, or slathered in chocolate sauce.\n\nAnd, every time they bring it up around you, you just have to grin, grit your teeth, and not. You say things like \"uh huh\" or \"wow\" or \"that's crazy\", before, mercifully, you are allowed to disengage from the conversation and swap the topic to another one. But, then, apropos of nothing, your conversational partner says \"oh, yeah, like the last time I had ice cream\" and then bam. You're right back to talking about that forbidden sweetness, the one thing you can never experience, but that everyone else can.\n\nSo, you bid your goodbyes to this conversation in the middle of his next spiel about how vienettas are superior to waffle cones, and head home. On the way there, you turn on the radio in your car, or hear it on the bus, or on the street as you walk, and the song is a famous singer currently popular, singing about ice cream, and how much they like it. Maybe the next song is a rap number about a dude who gets so much ice cream he's drowning in it.\n\nAgain, you try to ignore it, and go home. Maybe you should finish that TV show, or put on a movie, or maybe read a book. But, oh look, there are people on the street ahead, casually enjoying an ice cream cone. How many doesn't matter, just that they're there. So, you cross the street and opt to take a longer route home than usual. This, of course, takes you past a few more reminders of the thing that you will never have.\n\nEventually, after however long, you manage to crawl through your doorway and let out a long-suffering sigh. Finally, you are safe from the never-ending barrage of people and their ice cream. You settle in for the night, and flick on the TV. The news is on, a study about how people who don't get enough ice cream may suffer adverse health effects. The next channel has a popular soap opera, and the current plotline is a critically-acclaimed one about someone forced to endure a whole *week* without ice cream.\n\nThe movie channel has a cheesy b-grade ice cream flick on. It's predictable, but it doesn't matter. It's just another reminder. You shut off the TV and put on a movie. The characters enter into a side plot about their ice cream. The TV show has whole arcs around new ice cream, young ice cream, or old ice cream.\n\nYou pick up that book only to remember, it's got ice cream in it. \n\nDejected, you decide to go to bed, maybe surf the internet for a while. You end up in a community of people who don't necessarily like ice cream, or can't have it, just like you. You resonate with these people, and vent your frustrations into the Void. You feel slightly better, until the comments pop up;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\- \"Maybe you should get rid of that negative attitude about ice cream, you'll get it more.\"\n\n\\- \"Man, sucks that you've never had ice cream. But, never say never, I believe you can get some!\"\n\n\\- \"Bro, just stop focusing on ice cream so much. It's not healthy. Just stop thinking about it, and you'll get it.\"\n\n\\- \"Maybe servers would give you ice cream if you cleaned up a bit and left the house more.\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nYou scream into your pillow, shut your phone off, and go to sleep. Unfortunately, your dreams are plagued with thoughts that, maybe, perhaps one day, you may get to experience ice cream for yourself.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThose more astute among you will realise what I'm getting at, as I haven't exactly made it subtle, here, have I?", "subreddit": "ForeverAlone"}

She actually told me I wasn't being creepy because I was scared of being so. She posted some of her crazy stories on the account and honestly I think she wasn't comfortable with me seeing them.

He can get any female he wants and talks about how easy it is and how he could just pipe some bitch whenever he wants. I just sit there and wonder what it\u2019s like to think that way and feel that way. My friend already got like 3 bodies under his belt and I\u2019m still just lonely and scared. Today I was with the same friend and we\u2019ve bin friends for 4 years. He is literally too attractive to females. Today we had three very attractive girls over and when they walk through the door and they see my face I can see them compare me and him immediately. My friend who literally drips sex appeal easily wins. I literally get so self conscious and lose confidents to the point I don\u2019t even introduce myself. I hate it. I just sit there and be awkward and silent, I looked like a fucking creep. I get so nervous and crumble under the thought that I\u2019m the ugly one in the room. I go through the night silent and uncomfortable. We end the night off with a movie and my friend is getting friendly with all three girls and I just sit there and wanna leave.

I\u2019m still upstairs and I hear both of them say that they are not coming up to say goodbye and just yell out, \u201cgoodbye whoever you are\u201d and walk out. I felt like nothing, completely worthless, pretty much like a complete piece of shit. I know it\u2019s all my fault they treated me like this.

Your English is more likely not as good as native speakers, you are less desirable by women. And when you moved here when you're over 20, you already missed a lot. Yes you can have a good career, but you pretty much have no option but to go back to your country to find and marry someone. All the dudes I know (same generation as me) they all went back to our country for marriage. Even then, there's no guarantee that you'll have a good family. I've seen many women leave them and find a new partner. They most likely just wanted a free ticket to a better country.

What was your experience like?", "author": "Fixed_Assets", "self_text": "When I was much younger, I met someone once online who I ended up meeting in real life for a date.  It was supposed to be an all-day affair, but like 30 minutes into the date, she basically said she got a call from work and so she had to go in.  Never heard from her again.\n\nI met that girl online in a service called Yahoo! Groups (a very early ancestor to this type of board, actually).  But I've never used online dating apps or websites.\n\nBack when I was in my early 20s, around the Bush years, it was considered a mark of shame to be on online dating sites.  It basically implied that you didn't have the looks or social skills to get a date the normal way so you had to resort to going online to find other desperate and socially awkward people.  I wasn't so worried about finding people on those sites as much as I was worried about someone else finding me on those site and basically giving me shit for it.\n\nAs I got older and dating sites became more mainstream, I still stayed away, but for different reasons.  Sites like Tinder, Bumble and other swipe-able apps are really just to help hot guys get laid and I am not a hot guy.  Sites like eHarmony are better at finding people relationships, but they probably would reject me since I am an atheist.  And I've noticed that people who use OKCupid, Match, and POF tell me stories about the strange, creepy guys they find there, and the women who tell me these stories are typically desperate themselves and dealing with severe emotional issues (like trying to get back at an ex, or getting over a divorce, etc).  But I think the #1 reason I would avoid dating sites is the same as the original reason - I work with a LOT of women (note to the guys, if you want a career where you are surrounded by chicks, go into accounting. :D ) and most of the rapport I've developed with my colleagues is largely because they see me as an eccentric but harmless guy who isn't into dating or sex.  I think if someone found me on a dating site, or did anything else that would openly confirm that I am anything other than a eunuch, it would make people around me really uncomfortable.\n\nWhat about you?

I don't really see the point of that at all, personally. \n\nFirstly, I don't want some one night stand with a guy. I want a relationship. Guys on Tinder usually want to just have sex. \nSecondly, most these dating apps are solely based on your looks. I'm ugly so no guy is going to pick me on this site and that's just going to lower my self esteem. \nThirdly, dating apps just seem artifical to me. I don't want a relationship with someone else just because we both were looking for a relationship,  if that makes sense? I guess I just mean that I'd rather have a friendship develop into a relationship or I'd rather meet a guy and naturally hit it off and have a relationship from that. I don't want to have to go on Tinder. \nFinally, for me personally, my problems are much deeper than just issues dating. I'm not normal, I don't have good social skills. If I found a partner on a dating app, it would just reinforce the fact that I'm not normal and I need to go to a dating site to find someone instead of finding someone at work or through friends like normal people my age. I don't want to have to go to a dating app. It would be the last resort for me. I want to just be normal and find a romantic partner through friends or something, the way other people do.

I'm not a germaphobe or anything like that. It's just that i don't like being hugged,  kissed, massaged, rubbed...etc - not by friends, not by anybody. I treat people kindly and i do shake their hands but thats as far as i'll go. I've been like this for as long as i can remember. And its mainly for this reason that i prefer to be alone. I've never been in an intimate relationship in my life and i do feel lonely sometimes but i just treat it like any other bad feeling that eventually passes.\n\nHowever, the other night, i had this dream where i was in a large dark hall with rows of empty chairs in the center. I was sitting there alone for a while and nothing felt particularly out of the ordinary. A little bit later,though, a woman walked in. She seemed about my age, my height and, somehow, i vaguely knew her. In this giant hall full of empty chairs, she chose to sit in the one directly to my left. I nervously adjusted my posture as she sat down but she didn't seem bothered. A moment later, she slowly moved over towards me to where our shoulders were touching. She kept moving closer until her right cheek was pressed against my left cheek and her back softly rested against my chest. The feeling of her face against mine was something new to me. I could feel her warmth. It started to feel euphoric; like the weight of the world was slowly being lifted off my chest. Waves upon waves of good feelings that i never knew i could experience kept washing over me  to the point that had me crying (i never cry) and i couldn't get enough. I never wanted to leave that hall or that chair. I never wanted to leave her (whoever she was). \n\nThen i woke up... \nIt was like waking up from a soul shattering nightmare. I felt terrible. I still feel terrible. I've been barely functioning for the last few days and it's really showing at work and with friends. I don't feel like my old self anymore.

I always feel out of place and awkward, for literally no reason. For example, some days I could be sad, other days it's just neutral; some days make me want to go under the sheets and cry my heart out, y'know? There are other times where you just feel anxious for no reason, and can't really control it? We all have these feelings and sometimes I just wish that our folks could understand us and not say things like, \"Stop crying, you're being such a baby!\" or \"Man up!\" or something else; whatever the action might be, because they don't understand. They don't understand what's like to go through pain every day and you're lonely and tired and want to change yourself, but feel unmotivated and by the time you are, it's too late to even start. You feel you should seek help, but you don't want to because a) You don't feel as if you might have an actual disorder, considering you only have like 1 or 2 symptoms, but have them frequently, b) You get shut down so much you don't really know anymore, or c) You think that the therapist won't actually help you because how can a stranger solve your problems, you can't trust anyone nowadays? The only reason I'm writing this is because I don't feel okay. Nothing in this world makes sense. I wish people would understand me. My parents say to stop acting like a baby and why I'm crying so much. \"I don't know; maybe I'm depressed, you would know that if you actually understood me!\" but I'm just here in the dark. I'd go to my friends, but they are not really my friends. I mean, they are, but we aren't that close, and they wouldn't understand. Plus, I haven't really talked with anyone since I got home from Jamaica a few days ago. There's so much I want to do, but it all feels hopeless. I imagine the future and what life will be like, but I am having so many envisions. I'm just worried; I'm going to be in my last year of middle school and then going to high school, and I'm definitely worried for that. I honestly wish life was so simple and people weren't so judgemental. I can usually handle it, to a certain extent. I usually ignore it; do something else like a hobby. Now, I don't know what to do. I'm so tired like I don't have the energy to do these things. So I just go on YouTube and Reddit or listen to music. July will be over soon and then I'll hate myself for not accomplishing anything over the summer. I swear, if I had any siblings or pets, I would tell them this, probably.\n\nSomething that really bugs me is people. People walk down the street and see a homeless person and don't do anything. Why do people do that? Tbh, depends on what the person was doing and their action, but still, can't people donate a little money? A few years back, I came out of Sam's Club with my mom and we saw a homeless lady with her dog and we passed them. I wanted to look back, but didn't, in fear of what my mom would say. I asked her why she didn't donate any money and she said that she didn't have any spare cash on her. I knew that was a lie. Why do people not donate? I always wanted to help people; it was a secret dream I never told anyone. Now I'm not saying this is all people though. I wish I could help. But being 12, almost 13, and being very socially anxious, awkward, introverted, and lonely, I can't do much. All I can do is express my feelings on Reddit. So yeah.

I dont feel like I'm getting along well there because I'm so young and most of the people I work with are 10-30 years(I think) older than me.\n\nAt my other job, I work with jewelry and I get jealous of people there with their significant other buying engagement rings or nice gits for each other.  I'm so tired all of the time and when Im off work I just want to go home an veg out. To top it all off, I have a slight anxiety disorder and I dont want to open up to anyone (which is something I need on work on). \n\nI guess I'm just posting this because I cant really say it anywhere else without feeling like I'm bitching.", "subreddit": "lonely"}

I know i am a major fuck up and i don't deserve a gorgeous girl as i am not good looking either. When  i remember how my friend told me his story of banging a hot chick a few times, i feel such anguish. It's unbearable. A few days ago i messaged a friend that i feel like putting a knife through my windpipe. I cried at night for like an hour. Mute screams, live with my parents so. I am also broke, poor. m 20 and never even kissed a girl. i tried to get a gf, i didn't go for top girls as they were out of my league and i like most girls anyways, all are pretty good looking, but oh my god how bad it hurts when each girl just ignores you. I really wanna do the stuff that i see 16 yo do when i go to parks. but alas that's not possible now. i end up masturbating cuz m at home all day(have been trying to stop but didn't have too much success yet as i have lots of financial stress, which definately is contributing to my bad looks and also all this making it harder for me to actually study and get some good job). i went for a movie with my friend yesterday, spiderman far from home. But before that, yesterday morning i decided that i know i don't wanna die, and i can't get what i want in life, i am not gonna be the hot dude, so i don't really wanna live either as a virgin all my life, feeling unattractive, so i accepted truely for the first time that yeah i have lost, i've thrown my life away, and i am a failure and my daydreams aren't coming true. Now i am just gonna be alive, do what i should do like normal stuff with no hope or aspirations of any kind, just stick this life out. Like deep down i don't  care but i try to do my best full knowing that i am not getting the thing that i want. but still living it. i laugh when i am out with some of my friends, not fake laugh, i am happy(a little when we crack jokes), but i am also dead and hopeless inside when it comes to the biggest desire of me of being close to a girl. so yeah. no matter what anyone said to me i know that that pain wouldn't go away until i have been laid a few times. but giving up every hope and accepting that i am not a attractive boy and like not a boy at all, just an alive piece of meat who tries to do his best with what shitty brain he's got and body he's got or made it worse over time, have gone fine since yesterday.\n\n for other guys out there who also long for girls to like them but have had no luck, i just wanna say i know how utterly heart-wrenching it feels, I know exactly how it feels and i wish that you get a girl with mutual feelings, i really wish that. try to take care of yourself still, cuz on a completely different note, i have written in \"notes to myself\" that there is always a worse, so there is always a point in not destroying yourself further no matter how hung up you are on something. but again i doubt it'd really help as it just feels soooooo bad. mostly such posts relating to never being in relationship is ignored and i think it's cuz there are a lot of these and people don't know if there really is a solution and there are probably a lot of such posts? Whatever the reason, i really do see these posts and think it's brave to share things like this here. in fact i started writing this as a comment to the post \"suicidal seeing women irl and online\" in this sub but it was too long so i made it a post. m gonna leave a comment on his post, his post kinda made me wanna get this off my chest.", "subreddit": "lonely"}

I just focussed improving for next time and the idea that it\u2019s not an overnight fix will take years of working on this.\n\nLast month I was feeling very comfortable with myself for the first time ever, my head was straight and confidence high so decided to download hinge, got more matches than I expected (maybe averaged about 5 or so a week) and after a couple weeks got a date, went well, we got on (couldn\u2019t believe a good looking girl was sat in front of me with no monetary incentive). I thought maybe a fluke but nothing to lose so asked her out again and she said yes, that was last week, and second date was similar.

My dad did drugs, was physically and emotionally abusive to my mother, never me, but I grew up watching it. I mostly dissociated through it but ya know... it is what it is. My mother got remarried to a wonderful man who I now look as my Dad but I definitely had problems the first 6 or so years they were married (my teens.) \nI was in a relationship with a boy for 4.5 years and then he cheated on me (did NOT see it coming) and ever since then I feel like I\u2019ve lost myself. \n\nI\u2019m currently in therapy and have been on medications for yeeeears and honestly don\u2019t feel like my situation is that bad because mom is my best friend, I have my own place, nice car, great job and have my shit together. \n\nIn the past few years it seems like all my friends are getting married and having babies and honestly haven\u2019t connected with anyone since my ex. Not even in a romantic way but in a best friend kind of way. (Btw he has a fianc\u00e9 and a baby and I\u2019m just here like uhhhhh)\n\nI just feel so alone. It could be the fact I live alone or that everyone else is busy with their own lives and I don\u2019t blame them but I\u2019m just like... so exhausted. I would say I\u2019m a normal 24 year old girl and I have people to talk to or hang out with occasionally but I just feel so dark and low on the inside. I haven\u2019t had sex in two years (I\u2019m self conscious but also have high standards lol) and it\u2019s so past the physical part! I just crave closeness.

I\u2019m 19 years old and have Asperger\u2019s. I have very few friends but the ones I do have I hold near and dear to my heart. I\u2019d do anything for them. They went out of their way to give me a chance and welcome me into their lives with open arms so I\u2019ll always do anything I can to make sure they know how much I appreciate them. Lately though I\u2019ve ran into some trouble. I find myself feeling down over things that I feel like I shouldn\u2019t be even though some are normal. \n\n1) I\u2019m always scared that my friends are hiding things or will find someone better. \n\nI\u2019ve heard that this is a normal fear but I feel so selfish for the things I think sometimes. What if the reason they don\u2019t answer my texts quickly are because they found someone other than me? What if the reason they don\u2019t want to hang out is because they did find someone better but they don\u2019t want to tell me so they lie instead? I think these things constantly. I know they\u2019re selfish thoughts but I don\u2019t know how to shake them. I know my friends genuinely love and care for me but what if it\u2019s not as much as I thought it was in my head?\n\n2) I feel like I have to be everyone\u2019s absolute best friend. \n\nI hate the idea of just having acquaintances. I\u2019ve never understood how people are ok with having people of little to no benefit around in their life. To me having acquaintances feels very shallow and doesn\u2019t make any sense. Why would you want someone around who never prioritizes you in any way? It might partly be that I absolutely hate small talk but I\u2019m not entirely sure. I don\u2019t want to waste time with pointless conversation. If I\u2019m interested in someone whether it be platonic or romantically, I want to jump straight into meaningful conversation but to others it can come across as aggressive and scare them away. \n\n3) I don\u2019t do well with reading personal boundaries \n\nI\u2019m an open book but also very private. If you don\u2019t ask me something then I won\u2019t tell, but if you want to know something then ask away and I\u2019ll tell you anything. I have a hard time grasping why not everyone is like this or ok with me being this way. I don\u2019t understand why some people are so private or defensive about certain things. I hear people all the time talk about how they wish they could just talk to someone about everything in life. Well why can\u2019t you? Sometimes I\u2019ll ask a friend a question such as \u201cwhat did you do today\u201d and they take it as me being nosy. I don\u2019t understand why. \n\n\u2014\n\nThese are just three major points of many that I\u2019ve come to recognize in myself. Lately I\u2019ve been living in constant fear and paranoia that all the people I love are doing it for show or just because they feel bad for me. I have genuine connections with these people I deeply love and care for, but lately something has always had me wary. I know it\u2019s just me. In turn it makes me feel even worse when I realize I\u2019m potentially sabotaging perfectly fine relationships without realizing it in the moment.

An island for another year. Two? Three? I'm not sure how long I'll last if it's already getting to me. Even trying to make myself hopeful makes me hate myself. I can't even handle unexpected human touch without almost freaking out because it's so foreign. I can't talk to people; I only ever think about things that people can't relate to or don't understand. And other young people? Forget it. \n\nShould I just give up hope and focus on my interests instead?", "subreddit": "lonely"}

I was desperate to get out of this situation, as you, the reader, might be. I'd spend my day mostly lying around, and talking to people on r/lonely. Thank you all of you who helped me out. &lt;3\n\nI figgured out a way to end or greatly diminish my loneliness, especially tips 1 and 2, so here it goes:\n\nTIP 1. Find something to do with people face to face. The more you can connect with these people, the better (e.g. if you are 25, you may not connect with 70-year-olds), but any non-toxic group of people will do. In terms of choosing an activity, anything that you don't actively dislike doing should do (e.g. don't join a soccer team if you hate soccer). If you just kind of like it or better, that is great. You also don't need to be good at it (it really does not matter).\nTo summarize, it should be \"connectable\" and at least kind of fun. No need to be good at it. Given that, anything except work will do. (I never tried working to beat loneliness, but I'm guessing it won't do).\n\nTIP 2: Doing the tip above will take several weeks, AND several tries, until loneliness begins to dissapear. It's a slow process, so it will take several (took me like 9) months of slowly getting less and less lonely, until you feel almost none, or no loneliness at all.\n\nTIP 3: If you can, only bring up the subject of loneliness to people you really trust. Those who talk a lot about how bad their situation is bring other people down, and attract people who do the same, creating a situation that is bad for both. On the other hand, not talking about it with people doesn't make them feel down, so it is less likely they will repell you\n\nTIP 4: I'm not a pshchologist. If you need one, talk to a psychologist. Most of them will help quite a bit, so I suggest you take their advice. These people usually know their shit, I' m just speaking out of personal experience.\n\nIf there is anything that is unclear, please PM or leave a comment.\n\nP.S. Thank you all again for your help back then. &lt;3\n\nCheers", "subreddit": "lonely"}

It is extremely hard for me to accept the fact that physical attraction is simply not something I can have in a relationship.

I find most women my age attractive, so it is *extremely* demoralizing to me that I have only ever been shown romantic interest by the small small percentage of women who I find unattractive. It's likely they didn't find me attractive either, but saw me as 'in their league' so-to-speak.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI don't understand how an ugly person can be happy. I don't want a relationship with a woman who I don't think is beautiful and sexy. Yet that is what I will have to settle for if I want to avoid a lifetime of loneliness. How am I supposed to be happy and content with this? What woman wants to be in a relationship with a man who doesn't think she's sexy? What woman wants to be in a relationship with a man who finds the vast majority of other women sexier than her? Never mind the fact that I'd actually like my partner to find me attractive also.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy future fills me with a sense of dread.

The thing you get told about the online dating game as a man is that, since the response rate from women will always be low, to just spam messages out to every match you have and statistically you'll get a response. My issue is that it's a herculean task to work up the courage to message anyone in the first place. I've messaged like 3 people in the last month or so, which is a lot for me (no replies though). But every time I'm about to do it I tell myself \"I shouldn't bother her, I'm obviously not good boyfriend material and don't want to waste her time,\" or \"she wouldn't like me after she finds out X Y or Z thing about me so why bother?\" That last one is probably the biggest. It often prevents me from being bold, as I know is a necessity with finding a relationship. Also I hate that I never get responses even though I put a lot of thought into that opening message. :\\ This may be a bit controversial to say on here but I think my lack of charisma and how timid I am is the biggest roadblock to finding love, which makes it even more frustrating that I can't seem to improve.\n\nSorry, I know I'm rambling, I just don't have anyone in real life that I can talk about this with.", "subreddit": "ForeverAlone"}

And again I was stupid and blind, I believed her, then inevitably she left again without a trace.

And I guess all of that anger I felt that I used to turn into determination just turned to sadness, I turned to everyone I knew. My mom my dad my best friend and my 3 old middle school friends, of course the only true comfort I got was from my parents and my best friend, that was the second time someone close to me outside of family had died. I just didn\u2019t know what to do with myself, then the original girl came back, out of the blue with some story again, I again let her back in, I was in a very vulnerable state and I just, idk I needed someone else in my life, that was a mistake as she inevitably left again, I\u2019m 18 at this point, sad and lonely only going out once every 3 weeks or so to visit one of my friends, after a long time of being alone and sad I met this girl online, but that didn\u2019t last too long as she didn\u2019t want anything serious and I found it difficult to relate to her and connect but, I did like the attention and giving attention, making her laugh and stuff it was fun, but I wasn\u2019t happy, and inevitably she left, after even promising to still be my friend, throughout this long ride I have tried to make friends and relate to people but I\u2019ve felt broken, with somewhat small bursts of happiness because of my best friend, these bursts can last for days at a time, but she\u2019s a bit older then me and has a boyfriend, I\u2019d never even attempt to cross that line, she\u2019s really amazing, I don\u2019t wish to meet tons of women and sleep around, I just want one person who I can be with and genuinely be happy with, to live out my life with.. but every day it just feels like I fall deeper and deeper into this hole and one day I\u2019ll just have to realize that it\u2019ll never happen.

When it's really bad I can't even watch movies or shows or heck even see ads about couples, without getting intensely irritated. And, of course, seeing couples IRL is upsetting. I have had one relationship when I was 20 that lasted 10 months, and two times where I thought I found someone who loved me but in the end they were just leading me on (and as I'm terribly lonely I immediately latch on to the slightest affectionate gesture, so that doesn't help). But outside of those times I'm pretty full to the brim with extreme bitterness towards happy couples. Even with close friends or family. My best friend of 16 years recently got engaged and the news just made me feel dejected and put me in a bad mood. I don't ever show it; but inside I am seething and jealous, and reminded how I've barely had any romantic love in my life and see no hope of finding it again. Reminded about how I have no-one who wants me and how I have no-one to hold me at night, cuddle me, love me, enjoy sex with, enjoy life together -- how I am missing out on one of the purest, most blissful of human experiences. I have had Major Depression since early adolescence, so of course that makes things worse. But I hate the bitterness I feel towards couples. It makes me feel like a bad person. I wish I could feel happy like most people at news of an engagement or wedding, but all I think to myself is, \"great, more people getting what you aren't. More people experiencing love while you're left behind. Just reminding you that no-one will ever love you that way!\"\n\nSigh. I hate this.", "subreddit": "lonely"}

I was a valedictorian in high school and that tradition of hard work and perseverance continued into college (even despite my high school English teacher telling me I wouldn't make it in college). I landed an internship at NASA this summer as well. I've always had a tall and lean body type, but ever since May I've been working out three (occasionally four) times a week as well to improve my physical body. I am admittedly a huge nerd and spend a lot of time playing video games and watching science fiction/fantasy movies (Star Wars, LotR, Marvel, etc). I've been told in the past I have a very witty sense of humor and love to keep the atmosphere light, even at work. Appearance-wise, I'm definitely no male supermodel but I'd like to think I'm at least average.\n\n\u200b\n\nNow the reason for this post is that I really do feel invisible. I've dated only once before in my life, and that was two years ago now. When that relationship came to a close I joined several dating apps to help take my mind off of it and everything.\n\n\u200b\n\nIf anything the whole experience has just been a catastrophic failure and a massive self-esteem crusher. I'll fully admit that since I spend so much time doing homework/at work/gaming (always something different), I do not get out much. But even after years of routinely using dating services (perusing through profiles, reading responses, reaching out, etc), I've only had a handful of conversations that lasted longer than 2-3 messages, and none of them have led to anything remotely close to a date. That would naturally imply I'm just not a good conversationalist, but I genuinely read their entire bio before reaching out, and I always reach out with a relaxed conversation starter and am very respectful.\n\n\u200b\n\nI'm not a big social media user which did definitely burn me as after high school graduation I fell off the radar pretty badly for sure. It's just been an extremely common theme for me to blame myself and constantly wondering what more I could possibly be doing to gain the favor of women that wouldn't involve me compromising my responsibilities/interests (AKA clubbing and whatnot; while I know that's obviously not a bad location to meet women, I'm not even sure the people I'd theoretically meet in that setting would be my type since I'm not into drugs at all and can't really see myself drinking much at all in the future either).\n\n\u200b\n\nThat leads me to the title question: What is it that women truly seek in a guy?

I posted a couple more recently and all of the sudden they are getting railed. Negative responses everywhere. The thing is, all of the photos I have posted are selfies, and and they are practically the exact same, yet they are getting vastly different scores. Actually, one of the worst photos I posted (where the lighting made me look like a fucking zombie) received a 9.4 attractiveness score about a year ago whereas one of the best photos I've ever seen of myself is getting railed and is currently below average. I also posted a mediocre photo of myself just standing there (as a test) a year ago, and my face was sorta difficult to see and I was wearing sweaty gym clothes: it got incredible scores. Now? All of my photos are getting obliterated, like the fucking Death Star firing at Alderaan. \n\nI've also seen results from good photos of incredibly good-looking dudes (no homo) receive similar horrible ratings while blurry beach photos without a clear face shot receive scores in the 9 range. Additionally, I've seen results of photos of very average people, some of which you can't even see their faces properly, get in the upper 5% range.\n\nI don't know how the fuck they've done it, but Photofeeler is a bullshit scam that should never be monetized. It's basically the Rotten Tomatoes of photo-sharing sites: just like you can't trust critics anymore, you can't trust this supposedly \"unbiased\" method of getting photos rated. I don't know how and why this is happening, but this is just another \"Disney paying-off critics\" conspiracy. \n\nI know this is a long rant, but this is nuts. Do not trust, or pay for this site! I don't know how they're doing it, but they're fucking scores up and capitalizing on people's insecurities.

Most importantly, the idea of being surrounded by loving friends, family, and a significant other.  \n\nBut time and time again, they all crumble to dust when any small percent of loneliness, exclusion, or isolation creeps in.  Temper tantrums flare up when they don't get attention.  Sobbing, weeping, wailing happens when someone who showers them with the love that they've got so accustomed to, just happens to be away for a while.  Almost a \"bubble\" life where they maybe are not the king or queen (or prince or princess) of the castle, but pretty much emotionally, love-wise, they feel safe, happy, and secure.\n\nThere's a lot of talk of material wealth in society, how the rich get richer, and the poor get poorer.  And the rich often look at the poor almost as lower forms of life that have no one but themselves to blame for their misfortune.  This is EXACTLY THE CASE with emotional wealth (those who have a loving family, friends, significant other).  There are those who have it, and those who don't.  Is it fair?  Absolutely not.  But that's really the world.  And to add insult to injury, any efforts made to try to get it (maybe self-improvement, putting oneself out there in social situations), you're just looked down, spit upon, actively isolated, bullied, made fun of, and any other bad behavior designed to do nothing else but \"keep you in your place\".  But remember, this is all insecurity, and hoarding of emotional wealth.  Just observe: do any of them go out of their way for others?  Do they go outside of their \"safe space\" of activities, groups, people, at any risk?  Absolutely not.  \n\nWhy is this?  They are not as strong as you.  The fortitude to battle isolation, to face looks of disgust at less physical features, the lack of status and money, the lack of any kind of love or friendliness in your life, to face rejection EVERY SINGLE DAY, and to take verbal abuse of how \"it's your fault\" and \"you deserve it\" whenever you falter, it takes SO MUCH to be able to get through to the next day.  And EVERY SINGLE ONE OF YOU DOES IT, AND PUTS UP WITH IT.  \n\nSo for what it's worth, I've seen those who have it all emotionally, and trust me, despite this show of strength and security, the flaunting of an SO, love, and confidence, it's built on shaky foundations.  Insecurity, fear to step outside of their comfort zone, trying to validate themselves on social media or in person, it's disgusting on some levels.  It's a \"F you, I've got mine\" mentality, combined with a \"born on third base\" sense of entitlement of this emotional wealth, that makes them step on all of you the way that they do.  \n\nFor what it's worth, most people would not survive the emotional turmoil that you all face every day.  They'd crumble and fall apart.  Really, you have SUCH STRENGTH, and maybe the words of an internet stranger may not mean much, but I really do believe this.", "subreddit": "ForeverAlone"}

Seriously, I feel as if my life is spiraling downhill because of that creeping feeling of loneliness, alienation and depression. Every single day I put 12-14 hours of work because I have nothing else to do and need to somehow fill the black hole of loneliness and sorrow eating me from the inside. Every single evening I'm either drinking or smoking weed at home, and when I'm not doing this - I'm seriously scared I'm going to kill myself sooner or later, that feeling intensifies 10x being sober.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI don't have any friends, people to hang up with, let alone girlfriend: I don't have any social circle at all, except for two friends who both live 3 and 5 thousand kilometers from me and have their own lives to take care of. At this point I feel detached when looking at people making social interactions with each other, it looks and feels so surrealistic and so sad. Every time I see happy couples passing by, people having fun with each other, families having rest together, friends fooling around, I feel as if the whole universe of sadness and hopelessness is concentrated around my chest and my stomach, which is about to explode. Even watching porn brings me nothing but emptiness and severe anxiety - and hell, I do it extremely rarely, because of my libido being almost non-existent at this point...\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI spend 3-4 days a week in the gym to somehow keep myself uplifted, which doesn't work **at all** for the last year or so.

I'm coming from an extremely poor family and always thought I'd become rich and things would be ok - it was such a fucking trap, you don't even know how fucked up and ironical that is... I swear I would give up all of this fancy luxury shit to simply live a life of joy, happiness and have at least someone in my shitty life who genuinely cares about me and is interested in me as a person, as a man, as a friend, as a soulmate, as a sexual partner - whatever the fuck it be. It may sound fake, far-fetched, irrational, illogical, but that's the way it is. All I really want is just some emotional and physical affection, some basic human intimacy, whether with the opposite gender or not, but sometimes I honestly think that is never going to happen: time is passing by at the speed of light, nothing changes despite all previous effort and attempts to somehow fix my miserable lonely existence.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSorry, I had to let it out and vent.

My life is empty, hallow, meaningless.\n\nI'm 28 years old and I'm having a mid-life crisis.\n\nI grew up sweet, kind, loving, naive, and full of optimism. Now I am the complete opposite.  I've  been treated so poorly for so long that, over time, slowly, I have become a monster. All I wanted, growing up, was a friend. Someone I could share with and grow with. No matter how hard I tried, I was always treated like shit, picked on, bullied. I felt my good qualities start to dimish slowly after high school. Up until I met some people on college, friends. At first I was happy, and then I started to realize, I was just being used. I had a couple of relationships in this time period but nothing really lasted. \n\nThen I met her. I was 20 she was 18. Life was perfect between us. Or so I thought. Love is blind you see. It all came flooding back to me. The joy, sweetness, kindness, and naive optimism. I was a fool. We dated for 4 years. In that time. I heard whispers but payed them no mind. Insecurities started to build for me, but I pushed them all away and put my heart and soul into her. She was my everything. \n\nWe got engaged in 2015. I was going to marry the love of my life. The most beautiful woman in the world. I was so infatuated with her, I couldn't even imagine to look if another woman might be looking my way. We got married in 2016 and got pregnant with our first child the year after.\n\nAfter months of cyber cheating, drinking, treating me like trash, and emotionally abusing me in ways my heart cant handle, she confessed she slept with someone else just months before we got married. \n\nWhenever she got upset or mad at me, I was always the asshole. She never listen to a word I had to say to her, and wonder why I stopped talking to her as much. And why we didnt have talks the way we used to together. During early reconciliation she pushed the idea of having another baby. Apparently she never really understood me either. She is now 6 months pregnant. I was so blind to everything horrible in this world. I can't leave her because I love her. I can't stay with her because I hate her.\n\nBeing the nice guy turns you into a monster. I have been called an asshole so much, that now. Slowly and subconsciously my mind figured, \"I might as well earn the title\". \n\nI need help but I'm too ashamed to admit it. I need a psychiatrist but I'm to proud to go. No one knows who I am or how I feel because sharing my emotions makes me week and vulnerable.  I'm so afraid of letting people know or see who I really am because that person has always been treated like shit. Im afraid that someone will use it all against me. \n\nI'm paranoid, angry, sad, upset, lost and hopeless. I'm 28 years old, and I feel like my life has already ended with how much time I've wasted. \n\nNo one cares enough for me. To push, pry, fight, and shove their way into my heart.\n\nI am unknown.", "subreddit": "lonely"}

The problem is, other coworkers still make fun of him behind his back for his height and socially it's acceptable to do. \n\nI have posted about how difficult it is to only be a few inches below average height and how difficult it must be for someone who is a few inches shorter than me. It turns out, there are lots of short guys out there who are very sensitive about their height and will snap at anyone who teases them. I saw comments about bagel guy and it was one short joke after another. \n\nI know bagel guy isn't FA due to being divorced and acted like an idiot in the video, but if what he's saying about being teased about his height before the video started was true, I can understand why he snapped. I'm not condoning his behavior, but you have to imagine after probably being bullied for your height for so long, you are not going to tolerate people teasing you. The problem is, society has no problem with making fun of short guys even though they can't control their height. If I made fun of a woman due to her weight, I would get told how terrible of a thing that is to say I would never tease a woman due to her weight and understand some of them are probably very sensitive about it. The difference is, society thinks insulting a woman due to her weight is unacceptable. Making fun of a guy because of his height is acceptable. \n\nThis relates to FA because we have posters who are short and are or have been teased about their height. It's not bad enough the FA'er who's 5'4\" is disqualified before they get to know anything else about them. People have to rub it in by making fun of them. Obviously it's not the only cause of FA because lots of short guys are not FA. It is a major weakness that has to be overlooked. A short guy is never going to be loved with their height being one of the reasons. If someone likes them it's despite their height. Nobody brags about how short her boyfriend is. \n\nI don't understand the double standard. Once again, please don't think I think making fun of heavy women is okay. It's just an example of something that society finds unacceptable. Also don't think I'm defending bagel guy. What I'm saying is that I don't understand why bullying short guys is still socially acceptable?", "subreddit": "ForeverAlone"}

I don't know exactly what sparked the sadness, but I've been feeling low since Wednesday. So I was reading something in Quora about a game and somehow I ended up in a question topic about \"How to accidentally touch a girl's breasts?\" And there was a couple of answers that recap parts of their own stories with that issue. All that got thinking about other instances in the internet where I read similar stories. It's like, for \"normal people\" is not a big deal. I remember that when I was in college we had to draw a mythological creature for the scientific illustration subject, and we had to do it as realistic as possible, so I asked the professor how am I going to draw a creature that doesn't exist, realistically? And she told me, something like \"well, you know how to draw fur, and how to draw snakes, so put fur to that snake and voil\u00e0!\". So I wonder how knowing how intimate areas of the opposite sex' body feel like might change how you dream about intimate situations. The closest I've ever been to a girl, was one time that I was with a female scouts mate, and she hugged me and I felt her shoulder with my chin. After that in high school, a girl that only talked to me because she wanted to team up with me because I was a hopeless nerd, hold my hand in two different occasions. When I went to college I moved to a different city so I lost all my friends and with that, all contact with women, so since then I only touch girls in my dreams, and when I wake up, I can't recall the feeling, and I think it's because my brain doesn't has the information to know what areas of itself would the touch activate, therefore it cannot translate the information from the dream into an actual bodily feeling. It's like error 404. Any of the you guys that are still FA has ever been close to touch a girl?", "subreddit": "ForeverAlone"}

I wrote out this little memory earlier as I thought about it\u2019s main character. It\u2019s all true, and may seem like it doesn\u2019t fit here\u2014but just read to the end. \n\nWhen I was maybe 8 or 9, we had a family thanksgiving dinner at my Aunt Patty\u2019s. She was a fan of everything bears and everything apples. We\u2019re talking statues, blankets, posters, cross-stitches, signs, etc. \n\nAunt Patty was moving with her husband\u2014a crotchety, banjo-playing Vietnam war vet\u2014to Las Vegas, and needed to reduce her vast collection of apple and bear collectibles. \n\nShe decided that she\u2019d let each niece and nephew choose a stuffed bear from her collection. (with a few favorites she intended to keep) I ended up choosing this large white bear with long fur. The fur was everywhere but the face, which made it unique from the other teddy bears which were typically covered head to toe in a single colored fur. It also wasn\u2019t the prettiest bear, but I really liked that it was white, and pretty big too. (Far bigger than my other stuffed animals, but not one of those awful Valentine\u2019s-Day human sized things.) \n\nThe bear was squarely positioned in an unyielding upright sitting pose, and measured in at just under 3 feet tall. \n\nI remember distinctly what Aunt Patty said when I chose the bear, she said: \u201cOh. I always say that he\u2019s the bear with the face only his mother could love....\u201d The bear didn\u2019t have a name, and unlike my other animals I never gave him one. I was too worried about damaging a \u201ccollectible\u201d bear to play with him.\n\nI don\u2019t remember much else from that day, but that bear sat in my room for a little over a decade after that. Now when I look back, I think my choice of bear was somewhat prophetic. \n\nTime and time again I\u2019ve poured not only years, but years of effort into girls who have ultimately been \u201ctoo afraid of hurting my feelings\u201d to tell me they\u2019re not interested. Some even reciprocate mildly only to eventually tell me that they \u201chope I find someone who deserves me\u201d because they\u2019re not interested. It\u2019s brutal to give so much to people only to find out it was pointless. It\u2019s disheartening and makes me want to stop trying to meet people. \n\nI\u2019m pretty introverted. I have just a few friends, but most of them are closer than other friends than they are to me. I\u2019m little more than a nameless background character in most peoples\u2019 lives. I\u2019m bigger than your average teddy bear, and though I\u2019m polite, loyal, and have a huge heart; it\u2019s been proven time and time again that I\u2019m \u201cthe bear with the face that only his mother could love...\u201d", "subreddit": "lonely"}

The one thing that has always pulled me back is my parents, they dont know anything about my depression but they are in an extremely bad debt problem, they owe over $600k in house loans which is the only reason stopping me. My mother has a small business and earns maybe $100 a week if she's lucky, my father works as a laborer and hates it, been doing it for the past 15 years and i can see him slowly breaking down through these last couple of years. I live in a very hot place the weather is a constant 32 degrees Celsius + everyday with really bad humidity and works from 5am to 4pm. I can see that they wont ever earn enough money to pay their debt off. They chose to leave our home country when my older brother was born which was their first child, it was cheaper and there were better opportunities then whats in our home country at the time (they both didnt graduate highschool so a \"proper\" job is out of question). As the years go on they keep telling me that they want to move back home but with the insane debt they've accumulated its pretty much impossible. So at the start of the year i started to think up ideas on how to help them out, not to be a good son but so i can actually \"leave\".  I ended up applying to join the army in my home country, the pay is about $50k a year and gets better after every promotion. I didnt think id get accepted but i did. Ive been working out pretty much everyday and gotten pretty fit in the process, i wouldnt say its enjoyable but i am pushing myself through it quite roughly. ive kinda rambled on for quite awhile but heres what im trying to ask. Is it okay to save up a enough money to help them pay off the debt and move back to my home country so they can live the rest of their lives happily, and once thats done id be able to actually \"leave\" without feeling guilty? I personally dont see a future for me, i dont want kids, ive had terrible relationships and have been cheated on multiple times, i dont really like to socialize, i have a few friends but no one i can really be my true self around. I hated school and barely graduated so i dont see myself being successful, im probably thinking about the future to much but ive always thought to myself that living isnt for everyone.

Just make an instagram account bro you'll see*\" Attractive men truly live on the same planet but in a different world. I couldn't stop myself from comparing myself to him, despite knowing full well that doing so would break down all the confidence I had accumulated the few months prior. But I did it anyway. And I was broken.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nToday I was out shopping for a t-shirt. Roamed around and did some windows shopping. Tried on a few that I didn't think fit me well. Got frustrated, gave up and started making my way back home. That's when I found myself near that street again. And that's where my weakness kicked in. I told myself c'mon.. it doesn't hurt to just go take a quick walk there and check out the atmosphere. It was a moment of absolute weakness.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nI hesitated, but I did go. It is a short street, somewhat dirty. women there sometimes will literally cat call you to get your attention. But you'll have to do the actual approach if you're interested. I walked down the street and up it again, and told myself it's time to go home. But the weakness had already set in. I started telling myself c'mon.. just a blowjob won't hurt. I have some cash so what's the problem? Surely nothing is going to happen. Prostitution here is legal and the women are probably healthy. guaranteed no STD's. I should allow myself this just this once.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nI genuinely stood at that street corner for what might have been 20 minutes.. going through the different scenarios in my head.. about what could be, what couldn't be, what the repercussions are going to be, about what kind of man this would make me...\n\nBut, yet again, my weakness got the best of me. I was honestly at an all time low. I hated myself harder than I ever have.\n\nIn a single moment, I turned around, and went back into that street.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**The Approach**\n\nIt was raining (yes, it rains in the summer here too.) One girl was looking out through the window, looking at her phone occasionally. I approached her window and she opened it immediately.\n\n\"Hi\"\n\n*in a heavy romanian accent*\n\n\"30 Euros\"\n\n\"Urm.. yes ok.. do you do blowjobs?\"\n\n\"Yes blowjobs sex touch everything yes\"\n\n\"OK well I only want a blowjob..\"\n\n\"yes yes OK no problem. 30 Euros is OK?\"\n\n\"Yes it's fine. So should I speak German with you or English? Do you understand English better?\"\n\n\"Yes German English yes. Come in now?\"\n\n\"Yeah sure\"\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nShe went around to open the door for me and let me in. I go in, try to give her a handshake, and she gives me a confused look. It takes her a second to understand what I was trying to do. Maybe it's not usual that clients are polite to her or something. Or maybe she's just slow. In any case, I maintained my politeness and introduced myself and asked about her name. I asked her how old she is.\n\nShe was 22. From Romania. A bit shorter than me. Honestly not very attractive but I didn't care. I was happy she didn't reek of cigarettes, but smelled rather clean. She never smiled throughout the whole thing. Very quite. But more to that in a second.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**The Room**\n\nNow she's leading me up stairs to a room. Things got silent so I took the opportunity to tell her that this is my first time ever so she should excuse my nervousness, (in retrospect, this was a mistake because I've already set the stage for a disappointment). While walking, she turns her head and gives me this \"Oh no..\" look.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nNow we're in her room. She starts undressing. She wasn't really wearing much to begin with, but she still didn't make any effort to undress in a sexy way or anything. Just undressed and stood there. So now I am in a room with a naked woman for the first time in my entire life. And I didn't feel nervous about that or anything honestly. The confidence I had built prior sorta helped with that. So I take a few steps towards her and ask her \"may I?\" Implying that I would like to touch her. She takes one step back and says \"cash first\".\n\nSilly me! I obviously didn't know anything about sex work etiquette or anything. But I give her the money and tell her that I'm sorry I didn't know it works like that. She replies with the fakest 0.3 second smile I've ever seen. \n\n\"May I now?\"\n\n*nods*\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nSo I start by touching her hips, slowly at first, still in control.. But well.. then my instinct took over.. I genuinely became a sort of uncultured beast. I'm not here to write erotica so I'm going to spare you the details but the point is, I was going very fast. Too fast. And she didn't like it. She pushes me off softly and tells me \"slow. Make slow yes?\"\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nUnfortunately I wasn't me. I knew that one should take their time. I knew that I shouldn't change what I'm doing every few seconds. I knew that you shouldn't be too aggressive because girls don't like that. But again.. I wasn't really me. I just wanted to do as much as I possibly can.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nAfter like two minutes of this she says \"OK OK stop. I give blowjob now yes?\"\n\nMe, understanding that she's severely disappointed in what I'm doing, wanted to stop her misery, and told her yes.\n\nShe tells me to lay down, I pull down my pants. She puts a condom on my penis and goes to town.\n\nDespite trying to hold back and be a bit more reserved by now, I let out a genuine moan of pleasure the second she started. I really couldn't stop myself. My body just did it and I didn't have a choice.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n3.. 2.. 1.. three seconds.\n\nShe gets up to close the door that went open for some reason, by the time she comes back, she notices that I had already orgasmed, and gives me this extremely disappointed look, sighs, and goes to get dressed while I pull my pants back up. From that second she never says a single word. I told her thanks and she just nods.\n\nAnd then I got out and went back home.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**The Evaluation**\n\nHere are some of my thoughts about what happened today.\n\nSex is as great as people say it is. If someone tells you sex isn't a big deal, they're bullshitting you. The absolutely amazing feeling of a blowjob, combined with excitement and hidden nervousness is what made me cum so quickly.\n\n**Her**: She was *extremely* unhelpful. She didn't look or act welcoming. And most certainly didn't ease me into my first time. Totally unhelpful.\n\nThough to be fair, she did stop me from being very stupid and trying to go down on her, which is a great thing. Looking back at it now I cannot believe that I was about to do it. So props to her for that.\n\n**Me**: \n\n*What* Could I have done better? I could have taken my time, and not change what I was doing every .25 seconds. I could have tried to read her facial expressions. But I didn't because, well, I'm a virgin.\n\n*Do* I feel like a different person? Somewhat. I'm glad I went through this embarrassment with a professional who I might or might not see again. I couldn't imagine how awful I'd feel if it were a woman I cared about.\n\n*Am* I going to do it again? Hard to say. Maybe. Maybe not. These 5 minutes in total were hardly worth my money. And despite her being not very helpful I still somewhat liked it. I just imagine it could have been a whole lot better.\n\n*Did* I just abuse a woman? This is a very valid question honestly, and I'm struggling to find a proper answer myself. I've seen documentaries that show how many of these women get sent to west Europe against their will to work as prostitutes. Their own families refuse to take them back, so their only other choice is to work. I genuinely hope her lack of enthusiasm was because I was a virgin, not because she never wanted to do this in the first place. I still need sometime to process my own feelings about this.\n\n*STD's?* Despite having worn a condom during a blowjob, where STD's have a hard time getting transmitted anyway, I'm going to get myself tested just to be sure.\n\n*Would* I recommend this? If you can find a sex worker who can communicate clearly and has understanding and patience towards less experienced men, and assuming you can afford it, I'd say yes.\n\nBut don't go out of your way to do it. Remember that I, as an individual, have a different life experience than you do. You might feel guilty or dirty afterwards. Know that whatever you choose to do will have consequences, and only you are responsible for them. And oh, for the love of god, if prostitution isn't legal where you live, please let it be. It's great but it's still not worth the heightened risk of STD's and breaking the law.\n\n*Am* I still going to feel this was about this experience a month from now? A year from now? Ten years from now? Hard to say. I hope I haven't just made a mistake that I'll regret much later.\n\n*Since* I haven't had penetrative sex, am I a still a virgin? Look, man, I don't know ok? I'm just a lonely dude not a philosopher.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nI'll be there to answer any other question you might have, so hit me with em.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**TL;DR** Spontaneously paid for a blowjob and it was a mediocre experience overall. Still might do it again.", "subreddit": "ForeverAlone"}

I come from the netherlands.\n\nLast year I had sort of a breakdown. I was extremely unhappy with myself. I have lost almost all of my friends all of them got married and were starting their own families. When I finished my university and got a degree I started working fulltime. Over the years I gained weight. Since I am very short I looked overweight and it made me look weird. I have never had a girlfriend in my life. My confidence at this point was shattered. I never tried to find a girlfriend since I looked hideous. I spent most of my time at home. I didnt care what I looked like. One day my depression hit so hard that I had a breakdown so tried to self harm. I hurt my self pretty bad. I kept this hidden from my family. At this point I knew I couldn't go on like this. I didnt want to be lonely anymore. So I changed. Since I was 164 cm and 75 kg i knew I had to start with my weight, hygiene and appearance. On September 2018 I started doing intermittent fasting, worked out and changed my looks. After 4 months i lost 15 kg and looked pretty slim. I bought great clothes and perfume. I went to the barber and got a pretty good haircut. It boosted my confidence. I talked differently to my colleagues. Made more jokes and kicked ass at my job. People said that I have changed. I am more confident and they want to listen to my advice and stories. While I was working out on October 2018 I also started online dating. Paid money for a premium service where it is guaranted you will find your soulmate.\n\nSo what did I get after all this work? What do you think? \nAlthough I looked better and in my opinion more handsome, i didnt find a single woman yet. All my dates where no good. I was always polite, funny and it never worked. I got some phonenumbers but after that i couldn't get in touch. Some blocked me, others simply were not interested. But still I kept on going and try to find that person. The day before yesterday I met my childhood friend at the atm. I talked to her and I really wanted to hang out with her again (not neccessarily as a date just as friends). We talked and she seems to be doing well. I gave her my number. I thought she would get in touch with me. Well it has been 2 days and no call or text message. I dont know but this really hit me. It hurt my feelings pretty bad.\n\nToday i realized something. No matter how much you change your looks or your personality. It doesn't matter in the end. I am still alone and have no friends. I cant seem to get a date after I worked my ass off to improve myself. Why doesnt it work? Because I try to be someone I am not. People say you have to be confident to get the girl but do you have to really? Do women only like confident guys? So many women with different tastes exist out there. I tell you what this is all about. Maybe hard work can get you to places... if you are extremely lucky that is. That is what this is all about. Luck.\n\nI just want to be me. I dont want to be someone I am not. Why cant anyone understand this? \n\nSo what do I do now? Well you tell me. I bought some booze and am a bit drunk. (I still can write) I want to drink more so that I can numb the emotional pain. \nSelf esteem is pretty low. I think I am pretty hopeless.\n\nEDIT: I am sober again. Next morning and I try to see everything from a different perspective. You guys made me realize that it is to soon to give. I will not surrender! Thank you all for your kind words. I have been alone my entire life but I will not be alone forever. I refuse!\n\nMy words to you all. Maybe people dont appreciate you but you help many people on this thread. You helped me! I am thankful to you. Although it sounds clichee but in the end your character is what counts. Being alone for a very long time or your entire life requires a strong will!

I had only one serious relationship of 3 years and that was 6 yrs ago. Prior and after that serious relationship, I had been playing around. Slept around town. Riding the cock carousel. My number is above 70 up to this date. I have been self sabotaging myself, issues about self love and even considering myself a sex addict. Thank heavens, I never contracted any infectious diseases (recently got HiV test screening and is negative). A big part of why I have been doing what i've been doing, is because I grew up hating myself. I've been constantly bullied for almost my entire life, that I end up disliking myself as well, and it turned to actually loathing myself. So, I resorted to alcohol to feel good and sleeping around to just feel being desired. But as I grew older, met good people, and developed real friendship, who made me realise my own value, I somehow started to like myself. In turn, I recently (for almost a year now) stopped sleeping around and focused my energy towards self improvement and my work. Somehow when I am alone at night and I am on my bed, deep thinking about things and worrying about my future, loneliness would always creep in. I feel so dirty and used. I know it was all my fault. I don't feel I deserve to be loved at all. This conflicting feelings of wanting to have another person in my life versus not letting anyone in because i don't deserve any of it, is constantly tormenting me. Should I just resign to the idea of being alone forever? Would there be someone who will accept me as I am? The problem is, I don't want to just settle for anyone who would first offer their love or something. I am trying to be like a normal woman, with a basic standard. Some would say, I shouldn't be picky because I am like a runned down used good, ought to be on sale for the lowest price possible.", "subreddit": "lonely"}

{"post_id": "cckc1j", "created_utc": 1562986475, "title": "Why I Believe Love Is Real", "author": "OmegaSirius", "self_text": "I keep hearing over again from these supposed \"science\" magazines and articles talk about love.   \nPretty much, I'll give you a more of a digest on this.   \nThe brief idea is, \"There is no such thing as love, it is only chemical reactions in the brain that causes you to have this feeling.\"  \nAnd for clarifying, I'm talking about romantic love. You know, the kind of love that desires for a soulmate?  \nNow with that idea, basically it revolves around the idea of how the brain can release certain chemicals, kind of like a euphoria or something. I'm not denying the fact that the brain does have chemicals with different levels and mixtures that can cause this. But with that said, it is still a very invalid argument.   \nYou can say the same about any other emotions. The proof is in the pudding, doctors and therapists prescribe their patients with medication to balance out these harmones and chemicals in the brain. People with depression are prescribed anti-depressants. People that are bi-polar are also prescribed medication to help control their mood swings.   \nEven people that have ADHD or having difficulty focusing or whatever take medications to help them focus, particularly targeting levels of the substances in the brain.   \nSo of course taking some of these medications isn't just for anxiety, studying, or relaxing, they're also there to help control your emotions like sadness and anger. It's just proof that love isn't the only thing being felt by \"chemical reactions in the brain.\"  \nAnother thing that makes love so different from the rest of these \"feelings\" is that love is metaphysical and can't just go away so easily. You can take control of your anger better, you can easily calm down after something, even in instant. And yes, sometimes you can be in a bad mood all day and still be angry. But in the next day you're probably going to be better, might even forget what happened depending on the situation. You can't be angry 24/7, something has to be causing you to be that. Maybe you got into a fight, and when you see that person, it fires you up, or maybe your favorite team lost and you're angry because of it. But you're not going to be feeling like that all forever, it subsides.   \nSadness and depression can be said the same thing, you're having a bad day, life ain't working out the way you planned it  to be, etc.   \nAnd of course, it really depends on the person and situation, which are all factors.   \nBut I believe love is different, love is real. Almost like you're being controlled by something or somebody. Or there is some universal force trying to pull you to that special person, and you can't help it. You start asking \"Why do I feel this way for him/her? Why do I feel the need to connect with him/her?\"  \nThere's even a world wide belief that some people love at first sight. When you just turn your head and look at him or her, for the first time ever, and you think \"I don't just want, I need him/her.\"   \nPersonally, I'm not really sure what to think of that, since really the first time I saw my love, I thought to myself, \"I'm never ever going to talk to her and I'm never going to acquaint my self with her.\" As it wasn't just a promise to myself, but a command telling myself not to.   \nWell as it turns out, it backfired on me. Ironic isn't it? Even I couldn't stop myself from falling in love, even when after I promised myself I wasn't ever going to be speaking to her ever, not even once.   \n I would of used gravity as a metaphor for describing how I felt, but then I remembered that Albert Einstein said *\"Gravitation is not responsible for people falling in love.\"*  \nA scientist said that, the one that came up with E=Mc^(2) . I'm sure Einstein was trying to say love cannot be measured or understood by science.  \nWith that being, how can one be so naive to believe that love is just something that happens in the brain?  \n\n\nThose are my thoughts on why I think love is real.   \nTell me what you think below!", "subreddit": "ForeverAlone"}

Like what the fuck have I been doing with my life? Why am I just now waking up and deciding to make a change?\n\nI think we all have our reasons for why we think we are FA. Not being attractive, being short, fat, ugly, weird, no social skills, etc, for me it's because of my weight.\n\nThis is really long, and I want to apologize for the novel, but I feel like I need to explain why I have been FA for almost 10 years.\n\nI don't want to come across as narcissistic, but I used to be really attractive. I started getting attention from guys when I was 11, which is creepy now when I think about it. I didn't look 11 though. I looked 14-15, which is still creepy considering the attention I was getting were from 15-40 year olds. I loved it though. It made me feel really good. I was told all the time how pretty I was and how sexy I was (yup started getting told I was sexy when I was 12.) I looked good and I knew it. I could not leave the house without guys approaching me, getting honked at, getting asked out. And this was happening when I was 11-14. Which is fucking crazy now that I think about it. I had my first boyfriend at 12, who was 15. After three months, he dumped me because I wouldn't have sex with him, and he found out I lied about my age (I told him I was 15.) So I did what every girl would do; I started dating his 14 year old slightly more attractive cousin. That only lasted a few weeks before my first boyfriend begged me to take him back. I was an idiot and I did. I then found him making out with another girl two weeks later. I then tried getting back together with the cousin but he shot me down. He called me a lot of names (a stuck up bitch, sl\\*t, said my looks will fade, etc.) All of this caused my self esteem to go way down. Not long after this, I started getting really bad acne and just was feeling really gross. Even with the acne, I was still getting attention but not as much. I had to wear a lot of foundation to cover most of it. I stopped caring about the attention I was getting, and actually started to detest it. I started to close myself off. I dressed more conservatively, moved schools, didn't bother trying to make friends, stayed away from boys, lost myself in tv shows, and just basically hung out with myself, my dog and my parents.\n\nThen I started high school. My acne mostly went away, but I was still feeling really insecure. I wasn't fat yet, but I had gained 20 pounds so I was now 140 pounds at 5'7. I remember my weight because I used to keep journals which I still have. So I started high school being really insecure, and not wanting friends, why the fuck not? I have no idea. Girls would approach me and try to be my friend, but I would pretty much ignore them. After a few weeks of being asked to hang out, they eventually stopped. Which made me kind of sad, but what the fuck did I expect? Basically at this point the boys at school were the only ones who paid attention to me. But the guy I was seriously crushing on was a junior, and besides catching him looking at me sometimes while walking in the halls, or during gym class (both of our classes shared the gym) he never approached me. So I convinced myself that it was all in my head. I started to feel really lonely, and depressed for a lot of reasons, one being because I thought the one guy I wanted didn't want me, and that I wasn't pretty enough. So you want to know what I did to make myself feel better? I started to eat my feelings. This is where my unhealthy relationship with food would start and ruin my life for the next 15 years. I gained 75 pounds in a year. So I was then 15 almost 16 and weighed 215 pounds. It didn't matter that I was a natural beauty, or had a pretty face. I was fat. Fat=ugly to guys. The guys who I rejected in the 9th grade, were now calling me fat, and were so smug about it too. They were soo happy that the girl who rejected them got fat. That should have been reason enough to lose the weight but it wasn't. I would go home and cry but did I stop eating my feelings? Nope, I'd just order a pizza, then cry some more. This went on until right before the summer before senior year. I finally had enough with being fat, so I worked out, ate healthy, cut out junk food and I lost 55 pounds in 3 months. At this point I didn't really look fat, but I wasn't skinny either. I was starting to feel comfortable with myself and was still continuing with my weight loss, but then I met a hot, sweet, funny, college guy who wanted me and liked my body the way it was. So I paused on losing weight (wish I didn't) and I fell in love and lost my virginity to him. We were together for a year then I fucked it up and he broke up with me. So at that point I was almost 18 and the depression and insecurities came back and I gained the 55 pounds back. I repeated the same cycle as I did when I gained weight the first time. Not really living, just going to school and turning to food for comfort.\n\nFast forward 2.5 years I finally tell myself that enough is fucking enough! So I lose 60 pounds, and the attention from guys comes back and oh now my ex wants me back. I was still very much in love with my ex, and missed him like crazy. So after a long two in a half years without any kind of intimacy and sex, I spend the weekend with him. It was an amazing weekend. Then a few days later I find out he already has a girlfriend. So I'm like beyond pissed and devastated at this point. So I resorted to doing some questionable things. I hooked up with a friend of his and fooled around with a married guy, all in a span of 2 weeks. This caused me to feel extremely low, and disgusted with myself. I ended up gaining all the weight I lost, plus more and for the last 8 years I have just been barely living. I work and I'm financially independent, but I'm not really living. I don't have much of a social life, no intimacy, no relationships. I haven't had sex in over 8 years and I am incredibly lonely, but most of all I am just SO fucking angry with myself for wasting my 20's. I can never get that time back. I just want to ask my past self what the fuck was I doing! I just turned 29, and I am feeling beyond depressed lately. My body will never be what it was. Yeah I still have a pretty face, but a pretty face at 29 is not the same as if I was in my early 20's.\n\nFor the last three months, I have been working on myself. I've lost 40 pounds (have 80 more to lose) but I don't feel better at all. I'm just so angry and depressed with myself for being in this situation. I am very bitter. Everyone my age is getting married, having babies, having sex, in relationships, while I am basically starting from scratch. People around me are telling me how good I will look once I lose the weight, but it doesn't really help, 'cause I keep thinking about how better I would look if I was younger and didn't have stretch marks, and the lose skin I am bound to have when the weight is gone. I'm gonna have a 40 year old mom bod, and then I'm going to have to explain to guys why my body is the way it is. I know I'm not going to have trouble getting dates, or whatever when I lose all my weight, but I am already dreading the surprise they get when they see me naked. I'm already planning on getting a tummy tuck.\n\nI know this isn't a weight loss sub, but I'm sure a lot of you are in the same situation as me, where your weight is holding you back.

But I can't stop thinking about it, especially in times in those we hear horrible things more and more often in the news.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe most harmless type of people are such who can't just live without speaking bad about others. They try to let everyone but themselves look bad by pointing at weaknesses of every single absent person. They're nice to you when you're around, but as soon you're absent the rumors start spreading. In some cases they even spread rumors that you insulted or even threatened them, just because you asked them to stop speaking bad about absent persons.\n\n**=&gt; Why should I waste time talking bad about other people? There's so much fun you had when not bothering about people you do not like.**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThen there is the type of human who seem to be great friends, but won't ever do anything to improve your friendship. They'll lie to you and always find excuses to not do anything together. They're seemingly ashamed of you as they actually don't want your friendship unless they need something from you. Even if they live in the same town, meeting up is difficult as if they live in a different country. They just don't want your full friendship, just the advantages you give them. They'll leave and ignore you as soon they get someone else.\n\n**=&gt; Why not just be honest? Either you want my full friendship or not, don't try anything between with other people.**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe most harmfull people to our civilisation are those who insult others in shameless ways and yell around like they just got a limb cut off. They won't bother to threat you, and will deny they did as soon other people are around or justice comes into play. If you try to speak calm with them, they'll just yell louder and repeat themselves over and over again: Any try to solve the problem will get destroyed by them in an instant. It's just terryfing that people insult you when passing by without even knowing you. If they have a problem with you, they won't even try to solve it calmly. Some of them are even open to violence and will come after you.\n\n**=&gt; That's the type I understand the least. Nothing to say here. In my town this type seems to be the majority and I just can't understand why people try to disturb peace.**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI could live with that if those people were the minority. But no matter where I go, someone always seems to try starting a fight with someone else, instead of going the peaceful way. It's super easy. Just admit your fault.

The best known is the 6 pillars of self esteem which helped tons of people. Most of you have big self esteem issues because of bullying, abuse and other horrible experiences. Sadly, to quote Branden: \"No one is coming to save you.\". You have to save yourself &amp; self esteem can only come from within. It sounds klische but it's true. Perhaps you read this &amp; say: but there is nothing whitin me except emptiness. Well that's not true but you have to dig. This book shows you how to do it.\n\nThis book (also available as audio book on youtube) could be a step in the right direction for some (or many?) here. It's not a quick fix &amp; reading it &amp; practicing the techniques will neither magically give you a bf or gf nor solve all your problems but it can help you to understand yourself better &amp; give you the self esteem you need. Self esteem is more than being confident enough to talk to women.  \n\nHere are a few quotes about love:\n\n\"There is no greater barrier to romantic happiness than the fear that I am undeserving of love &amp; that my destiy is to he hurt.\"\n\n\"But if I lack respect for &amp; enjoyment of who I am, I have very little to give - except my unfilled needs.\"\n\n\"If I do not feel lovable, it is very difficult to believe that anyone else loves me. If I do not accept myself, how can I accept your love for me? Your warmth &amp; devotion are confusing: it confounds my self concept, since I -know- I'm not lovable. Your feeling for me cannot possibly be real, reliable, or lasting\"\n\nThere is so much more in this book so I stop here. If you want give it a try- you have nothing to lose.

{"post_id": "cctb78", "created_utc": 1563045906, "title": "My FA story (male, late 30s)", "author": "sdgsdvsdfsd", "self_text": "I read a lot of stories from other guys here who think that being unattractive, unemployed or working in a low wage job is the major problem for attracting women.\nOne might say that the opposite applies to me. And yet, being in my late 30s, I am still a virgin that never even had a real kiss.\n\nI am being told that even as a child I was silent, introverted. \nMy father, while physically being in my life, never really showed any interest in me; he never spent any time with me.\nI have been bullied in the early years of high school and was a late bloomer when it comes to girls. There were maybe 2 or 3 girls showing interest in me, but I just didn't know how to handle the situation. On a positive note, the last years of high school were the only part of my life where I had a few _real_ friends.\n\nI graduated from university with a STEM degree. Needless to say, there were not many girls at the campus. I barely participated in extracurricular activities. And as I didn't really have many friends, probably no *real* friends at all, there were no opportunities for me to meet women.\nI botched the only potential chance I had: an attractive girl at the university indicated interest in me. She often looked and smiled at me when we saw each other, and we had one or two small talk conversations. I was too shy to approach and ask her out though. And when I finally did, she declined.\n\nI moved to a large city to pursue a PhD. It was a fresh start: I went out to night clubs almost every weekend. Sometimes with the one friend I had, sometimes alone. I saw other guys picking up women's phone numbers at clubs or bars. I never succeeded in that. I just didn't know how to properly approach them, or how to smooth talk them.\nI had a few dates (less than 5) with women I got to know via other means, but never made it beyond the 2nd date.\n\nWith a completed PhD, I landed a job at a Fortune 500 company. Working in STEM, there are not many women in my work environment. The only silver lining is that I like my work, make a good salary and have good performance feedbacks.\n\n\nSo here I am now, approaching the age of 40, with a PhD, a top employer and a good salary. I do lots of sports, I have a (non-nerdy) hobby and have been traveling the world, both work related and privately. Self-confidence is something I do not lack at work. I have a good sense of how other people feel the moment I am with them, I can usually see the cues in body language or behaviour and actually listen to what people say to me. I have been called charismatic. I also think that the nice guy problem does usually not apply to me -- I have no problem stating my opinions, disagreeing or saying no to a woman.\nYet, I completely fail in finding a female companion - from this perspective, I am an utter failure as a man.\n\nTo make things \"worse\", I realized over the years that I am apparently kind of handsome. I've had attractive woman - at the gym, on the train, ... - look at me, smiling, probably providing indications that I should approach them. I also noticed that when I smile at attractive women - on the street, the train, ... - I often get a smile back from them.\nOne of the few dates I had in my life was with an absolutely gorgeous woman that draws attention of men around her. Unfortunately I never made it beyond the 1st date with her.\n\nAnd I think these are the main reasons why:\n1. When I find a woman attractive, I become a very shy and anxious person. My heart rate increases, I become nervous,  I often instinctively run away from her, trying to avoid confrontation.\n2. I am anything but a smooth talker. Even if I'd approach a woman, I wouldn't know what to say except for an initial \"Hi\". In general, it is often difficult for me to keep a conversation alive. I am more of a logical than an emotional person, unless the conversation topic is something I am passionate about.\n\nI believe that if you approach a woman with self-confidence and you know how to keep her entertained (=talking) you can win her over.\nIf you have neither of these skills, then being attractive, educated or having a good job is not going to help you. On the other hand, if you are not attractive but self-confident and a good talker you can still attract women.\nThe evening I met this very attractive woman mentioned above was one of the very rare moments where I was talkative and radiated a certain level of self-confidence. I believe this is what won me a date with her.  But I was back to my normal me on the date, having troubles keeping the conversation alive. And I believe this is what killed my chances for a 2nd date.\n\nI am currently trying to work on my first problem, approaching women I am interested in. Yet the second problem - not being a big talker - is the biggest issue, primarily because I do not know how to fix it. I have certainly improved over the years but it seems I have hit a boundary; my brain seems to be wired the wrong way.\n\nI do not mind having almost no friends, or only fleeting friends. I am probably partially a loner. My only fear is never having a family of my own. Yet, I probably still have a window of opportunity of maybe 5 years left to find a women to have children with. I am hoping for the best, but starting to think that I might die alone, a bitter old man.\n\n\nIf you have made it this far: thank you for reading.", "subreddit": "ForeverAlone"}

I have friends thankfully, though. A few close ones. We bicker at times over small things, but when any of us are going through a bad time, we\u2019re always there for one another. But this is something I can\u2019t bring up in front of them. Not out of fear of judgement, just because I always keep this kind of stuff to myself. I don\u2019t know why. \nI\u2019m ok with being alone, but this is getting out of hand. This is gonna sound bad, but I\u2019ve pretty much never faced rejection. The reason for this is because I\u2019ve only asked one girl out, and we dated for a few weeks and then she broke it off. Ever since then I\u2019ve been scared to ask anyone to be with me. It\u2019s been 2 years and I just want to be loved or watch a movie with someone or cuddle on the couch or some shit like that. Sorry for sounding corny. \nI\u2019m a sophomore in high school. \nI really just can\u2019t take it anymore. I\u2019m not suicidal at all, and I like my life. It\u2019s just so boring. I don\u2019t live in a big city I live in a town in the middle of nowhere. And pretty much all the girls at my school are dating some douche. I\u2019m on the track team, but that doesn\u2019t make me a chick magnet. I just want someone that shares my interests. \nAnyways getting back to the original point, I don\u2019t know what to do. I have some problem talking to girls, but only when they\u2019re around their friends. I saw this one girl. She was really nice and pretty. We exchanged glances and smiles, and I convinced myself that I would find her after this event was over. I never did. And I wonder if I could\u2019ve gotten her number, but I\u2019ll never know because I\u2019m a tard. Is there some secret between guys that lets us just stroll over to girls and ask them for their number/ ask them out? If so please tell me because I\u2019m tired of all these missed opportunities. I\u2019m tired of all these long lonely nights. I\u2019m tired of all this sadness. \nIf anyone could tell me any confidence tips, that would be greatly appreciated.", "subreddit": "lonely"}

Up until age 14 (the year I went to school for 1 semester) I was VERY naive about the world, I thought that evil was largely hidden from plain sight. \n\nAnyway, like I mentioned I was socially awkward, so much so that I was almost diagnosed with high functioning Aspergers which I don\u2019t have. \nSo anyway, long story short I had a tiny friend group composed of kids I went to church with. Once I stopped going to church (13) that all stopped to. \n\nPhase 2: - 14 - 17\n\nYear 13-14 was extremely lonely for me so out of desperation When I was 14 I decided I needed to go to school. My parents found a small private christian school near our house and I attended there for half a year.\nThe school was full of other socially awkward kids who\u2019s parents were pretexting them from reality\n\nI made 2 (these were the only people I kept in touch with) close friends over that time with people my parents disapproved of. Due to there goading I ended those friendships when I was 16. Over all these years I tried homeschool group after homeschool group (literally all of them in my state).I was either to \u201c normal \u201c or to \u201c weird \u201c it didn\u2019t help that I was in a mixed race family (I was viscously bullied behind my back about this aswell as well as my poor social skills) \n\nBesides those 2 friends I saw maybe 5 times over the course of 3 years I haven\u2019t had a single friend in that time.

I\u2019ve done sports clubs ect but the same thing happens. \n\nI\u2019ve estimated through asking trusted confidants (my old friends when I had them my parents sister grandparents ect) that At this point I have the social skills roughly of a mature 15 year old...Im now 17...\n\nIn my family I\u2019m expected to be driving have a gf have a job be preparing for college ect I have non of that...but it\u2019s not all bad news.\n\n1 I\u2019m studying to get my drivers permit 2 I\u2019m taking the college admissions test for our local community college 3 Ive been working out past 6 months or more and I\u2019m fit and lean and attractive now 4 in actively trying to conquer my anxiety when it comes to job interviews talking to ect \n\nThis was a huge oversimplified version of my problems so I suspect I\u2019ll get a lot of crappy \u201c fix it \u201c or \u201c just do it \u201c answers lacking empathy and rational understanding but I\u2019m posting this anyway if maybe 1 person relates or has meaningful advice on HOW TO MAKE FRIENDS STEP BY STEP it\u2019s worth it", "subreddit": "ForeverAlone"}

I am a 19 years old guy, and I feel like I am completely wasting my life away. I have never been in a relationship (despite trying my best with my appearance and personality), I have no friends, I\u2019ve barely been to any parties, I\u2019ve been clubbing about twice, I have no memorable social experiences whatsoever. While other people are having young love, having memorable times with friends staying up and getting drunk and talking the night away I am just sitting here in my room miserable wanting to scream and cry because I want to die so badly but nothing ever comes out. \n\nI just don\u2019t know what to do, and I can\u2019t take living like this much longer. I really tried my best to make friends, but nobody likes me as I have a repugnant personality that I don\u2019t know how to change. I have tried hard to attract people, but I am immensely ugly and, again, I have a very poor personality. I\u2019ve tried to improve myself a lot: I style my hair, I wax my eyebrows, I take care of my skin, I go to the gym, I practice good hygiene\u2026but none of it works. I\u2019m skinny as shit because mental health ruins one\u2019s appetite, I have a disastrous face, I have a bunch of minor bodily deformities which while not completely malignant on their own add up to an overall unattractive picture when combined with the other characteristics I\u2019ve mentioned. I could go on for thousands of words on every little bit of my appearance that I hate, though it\u2019s not like anyone here cares so I won\u2019t waste either my or your time. I have tried therapy-I\u2019ve probably spent over \u00a34000 on about 5 long-term therapists over the last 3 or 4 years-and it\u2019s not helped in the slightest. They tried to teach me mindfulness, but it didn\u2019t work, they tried to teach me CBT but it didn\u2019t work, they did talk therapy and it didn\u2019t work. I\u2019ve tried 8 different medications and none of them have helped in the slightest. Every single day I get more and more miserable, bitter, angry, and cynical. I want to die so badly, I yearn for it, I need it, god the only way I can get to sleep at night is by comforting myself through imagining killing myself in as vivid and graphic a way as possible. It\u2019s better than the reality I\u2019m in now.\n\nI just look at other people and all the cool stuff they\u2019re doing: having dates, going to the movies, going to parties, going clubbing, going on tinder, having social events with friends (idk what people even do\u2026), and I want it so bad but I cannot get it no matter how hard I try. I am a worthless piece of shit with no good qualities, no skills, and in fact nothing appealing whatsoever. Why would anyone want to be friends with me, let alone date me? I don\u2019t blame other people for not liking or wanting me, I just blame myself for having no good qualities, and to an extent I blame my parents for being selfish enough to birth me. Why did they bring me into this world? I didn\u2019t ask for it, yet now I am morally and legally obliged to trudge through this dire existence which has no happiness and in which I am alone. I want someone to hold me, to hug me, to rub their hand through my hair, and to tell me I am good enough. I want someone to eat dinner with, who I can trust, who I can talk to about random bullshit through the night, hell it\u2019s not even about sex (though that\u2019s not irrelevant to it I guess) it\u2019s more just about the emotional intimacy. I want to be loved, to be able to believe that I have anything good about me to make living worth it. What is the point of it? How can I ever love myself if nobody else does? No-one has ever been attracted to me because I am a miserable, ugly, self-absorbed narcissist who is in constant chaotic flux between superiority and inferiority (IDK what I\u2019m even superior about considering I have no good qualities, I guess just because I perceive my own reality in so much more detail and so much more \u201cin reality\u201d that the experiences I Have within my life are elevate to a greater level of truth or importance. People say oh just have confidence, but what is there to be confident about? People say just be yourself, but I\u2019ve been myself my whole life and it doesn\u2019t bloody work because I am an UGLY AUTISTIC PRICK and my personality is abhorrent to most people. People say, \u201cdon\u2019t compare yourself to others\u201d, but these are always the people who are good looking or are in good universities or have good relationships and social environments. It is easy for them to say that as they actually have a reason to have self-worth and so don\u2019t need to seek the validation of others, which I do since I don\u2019t get any from myself (and for good reason). I think my mental health issues are a completely rational response to the situation of my life: having no-one that loves me, having no friends, having no good qualities, having no good prospects, and so on. I know at times I am only going tangentially to /r/lonely on this vent post but it\u2019s all interlinked. \n\nI want to be held, god I want a hug, I want someone to look me in the eyes and kiss me gently and tell me that I have value, but because I am so worthless I will never get it. I will never find love, I will never be someone\u2019s dream guy, nobody will ever look at me and think damn he\u2019s hot or damn I love that man. Nobody will ever envy me, ever lust for me, ever look at me and have their heart flutter, never be filled with pride, never want to be friends with me, simply because I have no attractive qualities whether that be in the context of romance or friendship. I want to die so badly, I yearn for it, I need it! I can\u2019t shoot myself as I live in the UK, I can\u2019t jump in front of a train as that\u2019d give the driver trauma, I can\u2019t OD because I\u2019m scared of screwing it up and becoming a vegetable, I can\u2019t hang myself as again I\u2019m so so so scared of messing it up. God I want to leave this conscience so badly, I want to go to bed and never have to wake up again, never have to have this deep pit of entropy in my heart with nobody and nothing to fill it. I never want to have to sit on my own staring into the ceiling at night unable to think about anything other than how much I wish I had someone laying next to me who loved me and cared about me and appreciated me. I wish so much that I had friends who thought I was funny or charismatic or clever and who actually wanted to spend time with me and didn\u2019t just feel uncomfortable around me (because I can\u2019t hold a conversation) or pitiful (as I am a pathetic person whose entire life is based around my mental health issues as I have never known any other reality and at this point I am so far into the abyss that my mental health has completely rotted my person into nothing. I am nothing but a messy patchwork of mental illnesses fighting for the top place on my suicide note, a battered husk pulled along the inevitable passage of time with nothing but fear and guilt pushing me forward. My parents were good to me, they really tried their best, but I still resent them for having me and bringing someone so doomed and hopeless as myself into this dire place. \n\nWhen I started writing this, I hoped I would get some closure and that I would feel a bit better. I don\u2019t. I still have that pit in my chest, I still feel a constant lump of anguish balled up inside me, I still feel just as manically miserable. I want to get a hammer and smash my flared ribs in and then mash my vile ugly face into shards of bone. I want to slam my head into a wall until this useless thing that one may mistake for a human life is finally set free from this pain and suffering. God, I want to die so badly, I\u2019m so scared though, and I don\u2019t want to do that to my family. I want to be happy and loved and dead and I don\u2019t know what to do I have tried everything I can and none of it has worked! I am doomed not because I have some insane irrational mental illness, but my lack of qualities and of good experiences are so clearly pronounced that the circumstances of my existence are just shit to be in. Other people my age (19) are having the time of their lives, finding love, having sex, partying, doing drugs, and I am just here trying to look up ways to kill myself on \u201csuicide-friendly\u201d websites that I know I\u2019m too much of a coward to ever go through with. I want all these things, I want to be good enough, I\u2019m really trying my best and it\u2019s just getting worse every day every week every month, god I don\u2019t know what to do anymore. I\u2019m sorry, I want it to be over, why must I suffer through this? I\u2019m sorry, this is a stupid post that won\u2019t help me get a solution and that nobody will ever even read. I have made countless posts on /r/depression and /r/suicidewatch but they all get no upvotes, no comments, and nobody cares. I delete them the next day when I see nobody gives two shits about me. I\u2019m trying here instead I don\u2019t even know why, I just want somebody to know my struggle and my pain, I don\u2019t even know why, I am sorry for wasting your time and mine in writing this worthless shit. I want to be hot, charismatic, to be taller, more intelligent, but since that\u2019s impossible all I want is to be dead.", "subreddit": "lonely"}

This advice is mostly for small talk. Its a compilation of stuff I've picked up over the years and a book I read\n\nI dislike small talk as well, but honestly it's pretty much required before you can develop an actual relationship with someone.e\n\nUse the environment/things that the person has when you don't know what to say. Please don't mention the weather. So far this has worked pretty well for me?\nFor example, you could ask about a keychain attached to their bag. Chances are, they are a fan of that character and would be happy to talk to you about it.\n\nWhen asking questions, try to make sure that they are open-ended and not yes/no questions so that the other person can elaborate. \n\nBe open about your feelings. Showing them makes it look like you trust them and it helps a lot. For example, if you are both anticipating something like exam results and you are sitting next to each other you can talk about how nervous you feel. Bonus points if the other person feels exactly the same as you. \n\nAsk them to help you look after your belongings/food when you go to the restroom. It makes them feel trusted so they'll like you more.\n\nAsk them for advice. This one has worked 100% of the time for me. Doing this shows that you trust the person and validates their expertise.  Most people are not arrogant and will not laugh at you for asking for help (mostly unless you are really asking them a dumb question e.g. how to flush the toilet)\n\nDo not mention controversial topics if you only have a casual relationship with a person. If they have strong views about something and you kind of oppose them, it probably won't end very well. \n\nI know this list is not exhaustive at all but I hope it helps.\n\nDo share any tips if you are willing to:P\n\nThanks for reading and have a nice day:D \nIf you tried out any of the tips I'm curious how it went for you o.O", "subreddit": "lonely"}

I've been struggling with some personal problems recently, and I haven't had anyone to talk to openly about them. Now, due to the anonymity of the platform, I decided I feel comfortable talking about my problems with you all and I need some advice if you have any for me. \n\nI'm currently in high school, going into my junior year. I have struggled with depression and anxiety for the last few years if my life, in addition to suppressed social skills as a result of family problems in my earlier childhood.\n\nLast winter, I met a girl named Nel in my science class. We hung out a lot that semester, during lunch and free periods. When I was around her I felt happy, and not lonely; it was amazing.\n\nAfter some hiccups around the holidays, in mid February we decided to start dating. Everything went great for about a month. Then, completely as a surprise to me, she broke up with me one morning in late march. She offered no explanation besides that I was \"clingy,\" and would not explain what that meant to her. I was devastated by this. I was back to being by myself again, and the loneliness set in quickly. It felt even worse to be alone, and my depression was the worst that it had ever been. I tried to ask a few people what had actually happened, but none of them had anything substantial to say to me about it.\n\nA few weeks later, Nel tells our mutual friend, Bill, that she \"only meant the break-up to be temporary, until we're both older.\" She then told me this as well, very emotional at the time, crying. Now, the other day I asked her if she meant that still, and she said no, very quickly. I asked her why, to which she simply stated, \"no.\" That kind of reopened that wound that had been dealing over. Do you guys know what's going on at all? Maybe you have a similar experience? None of this makes any sense to me. I can't keep beating myself up over it, but I don't know how, or how I can feel less lonely and depressed without her.", "subreddit": "lonely"}

I cooked dinner, and tried to cheer myself up with some videos about makeup. About 4 minutes before he gets home my dog (who always gets leg out as soon as he walks in) peed on my family heirloom blanket. I broke down. Cleaned it up and he wakes our other dog. She then crapped on the floor and I cried some more.

The reason I'm FA has less to do with self confidence and a fear of rejection than the fear of putting myself in an awkward situation. I dread being awkward. The dreadful silence in the air, racing thoughts looking for things to say and thinking the person next to me is probably thinking the same things too and I am making them feel even more uncomfortable with my presence. Thats what I'm truly afraid of. Never approached a girl in my life all because of this and its not an unfounded fear. 90% of my encounters with the opposite sex goes like that. I feel like I am looking at a different species I have no idea about and any wrong move I make might be the end of me. I constantly reconsider what I'm going to say or have said and if it was appropriate to say to a women. Did I sound creepy? Was that too personal? Was that even really funny or she fake laughed? Am I being too inappropriate by girl standarts? This kind of thought train leads me to increasingly be more silent and run out of things to say because I limit the amount of opinions and topics of conversation I share which brings that sense of dread that causes me to escape opposite gender interaction in the first place. I know that when I'm with guy friends I'm in my safe space and I know what things are considered appropriate or not. Most topics of conversation are fair game for guys. But I cant help but feel as though I have to hide majority of my personality and thoughts as they would come across as not appropriate for girl talk.

The times my buddies would get in relationships, and they'd sit on a waist-high brick wall making out before the bell rang in the court yard. No faculty would stop them, which it's not really their problem to begin with. One in particular was really painful to be around : I had one friend that was **everyone's** friend in our little group. He was charismatic, average height, and he had *actual* hobbies. In my clique of friends, that was a rare thing to have outside of video games and porn. It'd always suck to have female \"friends\" and have to cut them out of your life entirely when they start dating him... I did this for two reasons\n\n\n\n\n1. They liked him more than me, even when I was trying so hard to go my own way \n\n2. They *were* my friends at one point, and watching them suck face with this guy in particular was just adding insult to injury\n\n\n\n\n\nI had to watch this with not only my own clique of friends, but random bystanders would oftentimes do it too... Didn't feel particularly good, and brushing that shit off wasn't easy when you were literally the only guy that **wasn't** in a relationship among your group of ~5 friends \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI believe the closest I ever got to a girl \"showing interest in me\" was the one from our homeroom that was apparently terrified of me. I didn't know her name - and I'm pretty sure she didn't know mine either. I heard from some mutual friend of ours that she made it a point to stay in the back of the classroom to stay away from me, and would constantly look back at me to make sure I was as far away as could be from her. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe last post I made was about this one customer at work in particular that'd always make it a point to talk to me for a few minutes before she leaves. Judging by my past... Maybe that's all she's being - just *friendly.* If things are anything like high school (which, let's face it, they are - people are just as immature if not worse) , there's literally **no** interest. I'm like a shitty credit card : **zero percent interest**, for the rest of time. \n\n\n\n\nIt's one of those nights where no sad song can help me cope with the sadness in my heart\n\n\n\n\n\nOh yeah, and the one girl that works at my store quit. Today was her last day. Regardless of all the times we talked, the times I made her laugh and all that jazz, she *still* clocked out and left without even saying goodbye. Tell me how \"it's ur personality bro\" \n\n\n\n\n\n\n**I feel great**\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n# /s", "subreddit": "ForeverAlone"}

And get a response, with a third wish.\n\nHer wish was to know \"why a boy so cute\" put a genie as his tinder picture instead of one of himself.\n\nI'm sorry, what? Cute? That was not what I expected. I felt like Rudolph after Clarice told him something similar. \n\nIt took me about 3 minutes to figure out/word the best equally flirtatious response.

We weren't \"official\" at this time even though we were\n- constantly interrupted me whenever I spoke and cut me off. When I finally pointed out he did this, he said he didn't realize it. But the next week I pointed it out and he said it's because I don't get to the point quick enough sometimes. He really really struggled with not interrupting me\n- during one of our last big arguments he broke up with me, told me to leave then physically wouldn't let leave for 30 mins which obviously made the argument worse. He then said he didn't actually want to break up with me and didn't actually want me to leave\n- after our last big and final fight.

In the past people have done this and I hope it is still okay to do so. This post does not intend to advice or mock anyone. English is not my first language, please excuse all minor mistakes but feel free to ask for clarification.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**The loneliest of times**\n\nI was FA until I was 28 and in the beginning it didn't bother me much. When I was a teen and the others around me started getting girlfriends and boyfriends I didn't thought much of it. I was concerned with the fact that the people in school I had a crush on where out of my reach. But I was able to cope. Is was hoping for better times and thought that it was true what people were saying. \"For some it happens later\" some said. \n\nThe things that happened later in school were not the things I expected or wished for though. A friend of mine killed herself. Her decision took a toll on me and others. I became depressed, shy and awkward but tried to cover it up by presenting as weird and random. I had trouble with body contact, that I was actually longing for. I got fat and puberty added some sweat. I started harming myself and cut my arms. I was physically and mentally in a very dark place. \n\nIn the later school years I developed feelings for my best friend Alexandra, but she didn't have those for me. This unrequitted love haunted me for many years, maybe because we still kept in touch. After school I began my military duty (mandatory at that time in my country) and started university after that. In retrospect my unrequitted love lasted a little over seven years and in all that time I felt so alone. I wondered if anyone could ever love me if the person who at least liked me in the first place wasn't able to do so.\n\nAs those feelings vanished I started to hope. Hope to experience those things that others around me didn't even seem to notice anymore. I didn't know what a kiss felt like and it made me feel like an outsider, a non-human. I wanted to become a human though. I wanted not to cry out of joy anymore because a dentist touched my face once a year. I wanted closeness to another being.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Another low point**\n\nBut I didn't get that. And while I couldn't get what I really wanted I was at least able to function. I still had problems with mental health and self harm, was thinking about killing myself often. But from the outside noone noticed. My studies at the university went okay. I was neither the best nor the worst student. Life just went on. It felt empty though.\n\nI wanted to apply for a job that would have made it necessary for my mental health to be checked (research in antarctica). At the time I didn't even had my degree, but I was already thinking about what could come after. And since there was no love to fill the void I wanted to have a badass job at least. So I stopped cutting myself out of necessity. The wish to experience pain remained though and so I started doing fitness and sports. \n\nIt was amazing. Every run to the point where my lungs hurt was rewarded. Every time I put on too much weight on some bars and overdid it was rewarded. Instead of pitying fresh scars on me the people around me where impressed by my ability to not stop when it began to hurt. They did not know that this was actually the point I was hoping to reach.\n\nAll this changed my body. I lost around 30 kg (66.14lb). I got fit and became somewhat attractive.\n\nMy bodily changes changed the peoples reaction to me. At first I couldn't really pin it down. But it became apparent. When I entered a room with strangers they no longer looked at me leery. They were neutral or interested. It felt as if everyone around me had become friendlier and more polite. The [Halo Effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halo_effect) is real. I realized how much subtle hostility has been directed towards me before. And now that was gone. It made it so much easier to talk to people! \n\nAt that time I came closer to a woman that I was acquainted with before. Theresa. We hit it off so to say. She was so beautiful in every aspect. Never had I ever connected like this with someone else before. We talked about everything, we had romantic evenings, we snuck into forbidden places. Unfortunately she saw me as a friend, while I saw her as much more. Again my feelings were unrequitted. And that kinda sunk me. My physical appearance had bettered so much, but still I couldn't make someone want me. How repulsive was I really I asked myself over and over.\n\nAll this happened right around the time when I was leaving the country for a year abroad in New Zealand. I travelled to the other side of the world and spent almost the whole flight silently crying. Over the letter Theresa gave me. In which she wrote how great I am and that I suffice. I could only think that I didn't suffice for her. I hurt and I was so embarrassed.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**The change**\n\nThe first two weeks in this foreign country I spent crying in a hostel. I can barely remember what else I did in that time, but I must have done something else because I started working as a roofer near Auckland. I was living at the construction site, and there was not much going on. But the work was enough to keep my mind occupied. So I worked long hours and started feeling empty. It was as if there were no tears and feelings left in me. \n\nIn that state I began to really use online a dating app for the first time. Not to feel a thing while doing so helped immensely. I could do what I was too afraid to do before. I started to message women. I didn't care that most of them didn't answer. I didn't care that of the few that answered most ghosted me soon after. I received so much rejection but there were no feelings left that could have been hurt. So I just kept going. Until someday after a month or so when I texted this american woman, Katy. She was so funny! And also way out of my league, but I didn't care. I just kept going. To my profound astonishment she did too.\n\nAfter two or three weeks of texts we agreed to meet for a date. She was living in Wellington. I drove a few hours to get there. We had a date. I didn't tell her it was my first date, of course. We went out to eat, then took a walk around the city and came to the harbour to watch the stars. We talked about Science Fiction and I immediately fell for her.\n\nShe brought me back to my car to say goodbye and the she kissed me.\n\nIt was the best feeling I had ever felt. And in hindsight I was horrible at kissing. We parted but stayed in contact.\n\nIn the meantime I increased my dating efforts even more. Found a girl on OKCupid that was willing to meet me for a hookup. Then I hooked up with her and it was... Okay I guess. I felt nothing. She seemed to enjoy it. I didn't cum.\n\nLater I met Katy again. We had a short fling. I thought to have found the love of my life. For her I was a fuck buddy. One of the things that hurt the most. It's been almost two years and I still sometimes think of her.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Now**\n\nThe thing with Katy led to me mostly detaching from any emotions that are associated with love. I don't crush on other people anymore. I have a job as a researcher, though not in Antartica ;D Life is okay I guess.\n\nI became sexually very active. I kissed 36 people, had sex with 25 of them. I keep a list for some unknown reason. Some of my fuck buddies have become good friends. I live openly non-monogamous and am seeing two women at the moment. I'm also constantly trying my luck with tinder, but those moments are rare.\n\nI became somewhat of a bore. I gave up some hobbies like reading because the time I have to invest into maintaining my relationships and online dating is such a big chunk of my free time.\n\nExploring sexuality and intimacy has helped me so much. For the first time in many years I feel strong enough to search for help. I'm going to start therapy for some of my mental issues in a few months.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI wanted to come back here and tell you because in many instances when I was feeling alone and distant from all humans this sub showed me that I wasn't. Reading many of your stories helped me. The things I was feeling and couldn't explain to anyone else I saw mirrored here. In some lonely moments this sub helped me survive!", "subreddit": "ForeverAlone"}

Loneliness is an emotional response to lack of companionship, loss of connection and\u00a0[communication](https://www.betterlyf.com/articles/relationships/nine-steps-towards-better-communication/). It is a state of mind that craves for connection but somehow stops us from making one.\n\nLoneliness strikes in when we lack a \u2018true connection\u2019. Irrespective of the number of friends we have, we might still feel lonely if we\u2019re unable to find companionship or don\u2019t feel understood. Loneliness brings about a huge change in how we perceive things around us.\n\n* We may assume \u201cno one understands me\u201d based on earlier experiences\n* We may feel sad or unwanted in a crowd.\n* We may fall into a relationship very quickly out of the need of having someone around and end up feeling lonelier when we fail to make a true connection.\n* Thought of \u201cwhy me\u201d may stress us out and add to the whole struggle when we see people around us happy and getting along well with people.\n\n**Dealing with Loneliness**\n\n* Recognize what makes you lonely-\u00a0First step towards helping loneliness is to find out what is that we want in order to feel better. Unless we find out what triggers our loneliness and what is missing, we won\u2019t be able to work towards it.\n* Initiate-\u00a0While we have in mind what makes us sad, initiating a connection would help us reach out to people and reduce loneliness. Drowned in isolation we may unknowingly keep ourselves from initiating. This is something we can change.\n* Find potential places-\u00a0We can go out in search of places or activities that engage masses. These may work as a medium of finding like-minded people and building new networks.\n* Focus on quality-\u00a0Our focus must be on building a \u2018true relation\u2019 rather than \u2018for the sake of having one\u2019. Once we find a quality relationship, we may not care about the number of relationships we have.\n* Use alone time-\u00a0Loneliness could be used to explore our own selves better than ever. We can invest this time in pursuing the interests that would help us feel light and fresh.\n* Positive self-talk-\u00a0In loneliness, we may very often think negatively about ourselves. This may reflect in our perception of surroundings and in turn, we may expect rejection from people all the time. Talking positively to ourselves will help us improve our self-image and attitude in social relationships.\n\nShare your experience with us.

A couple days ago I tried to talk to one of those old friends, and the conversation was kinda awkward because I didn't have a clue about what was going on on his life. I learned that he broke up with his girlfriend, whom he has a child with, I didn't know that he finally found job after like 6 months jobless, I didn't know that he approved the one subject that was still holding him from graduating. At first it kinda gave me shivers, like that feeling that you get when you realize that you've lost something valuable , but I started thinking, why am I so sad about this? I barely talk to this guy like once every two or three months, it's obvious that I'm gonna miss on the important events on his life. I don't know what to make about this, I feel alone, but at the same time I think about all the drama that comes with human relationships. In the past I tried very hard to make friends but it's impossible for me to keep them.\n\nI was watching a video by Monday Blue where he talks about how some people start to believe that they're friends with the youtubers they watch, and I thought \"I understand that people, those youtube are the closest thing to friends they have\" at some point I had to make a conscious effort to keep at bay that false sense of proximity that one gets from watching someone's videos every day. I try really hard to not feel alone, I try to convince myself every day that is better to not have anyone to avoid drama, to avoid feeling guilty when I don't talk to the them in three days, but sometimes it's really hard.

I at once should\u2018ve gotten this of my chest (not like 6am after a sleepless night is the best time, but f*ck it). But first, let me describe myself a bit, aight? \n\nHi! Im Omega (real name hidden for obvious reasons), 21 years young and a swiss citizen. Im still living at home, am single and had somewhat a \u201enormal\u201c childhood. Normal in the case being raised the old fashioned way, respext my elders, finish what you eat etc. My early years were somewhat nice, having a few friends to play with in the old neighbourhood, but fewer at school. Got bullied for 6 years straight and kinda let myself be the lonely one with minor points where i stood up for myself. After that like any normal teen gotten an apprenticeship at a local store. Through there met some nice folk, but only talked whilst i was at buisness school. Following 5 months been working w my father, working on that dad-son bond i felt was not as it should have been. Till that point (19 y/o) i tried to date a few lovely women, but always got rejected (5 times was it?) either because i messed up or showed my feelings to no approval. \n\nAfter my time working with my dad, i got drafted in because service is mandatory here where i live, and i cant deny its not as bad as i thought. But i never had anyone considered a friend i talked outside my profession/work besides some short and longterm online buddies. This went on till November last year, where i decided and pulled through to become a Sgt. After training for that i continued back in my old unit, w the same CO i had before. In between my dear father suffered a stroke which left me now with enjoyment of snuff to a certain degree (various from week to week where sometimes i endulge myself lavishly or dont snort at all. At first it was to REALLY numb the psychological stress, but after that its more for enjoyment). Now im more than 1,5 yrs in military and begin to approach the end of this time. Havent dated since about 2,5 yrs, still live at home. Dad is still on rehab, my mom handling quite well for herself. Me on compensational leave, vegetating since yesterday in my room.\n\nI always relfected upon my life, what i did, how i approached it.\n\nTo the unkeen eye im a carefree extrovert, i talk open about most things and i love (most) people. I invest myself in learning others, what drives them and generally show interest in most things. My work ethic is: without genuine effort nothing is gonna work. And still i sometimes feel pity for myself, do i overthink myself? Am i the best i can be? Or am i still learning what life is and what i should do with it?\n\nAfter long consideration, theres so much id love to change, things i wouldve done or said, but right now?\n\nI think im happy and okay with who i am. Yes, i dont go out on weekends and trash myself with alcohol, mainly because i hate loud places, secondly is my lack of friends. \n\nMaybe im just a bit in need of sleep or a bit \u201ehigh\u201c on the nicotin from the snuff. Guess this one of those \u201eexistencial crysis\u201c kind of things where i dont know how to put things or think of them.\n\nIn the here and now, i somewhat feel accomplishement with what i did till now in my life, and the many years to come.\n\nFor anyone reading this: Thanks for looking through this giant text, and maybe sharing your mind on my existence or just giving it a thought.\n\nMaybe i should do this more often...", "subreddit": "lonely"}

I'm currently 21 going into my last year of university. Like most of you, I suffered from depression, social anxiety, and low self-esteem. It all started when I was 14, I moved away from my home country with my sister to study abroad. The first semester of high school was a nightmare, I didn't make many friends, and even if I did it felt like they were doing it out of pity. Looking back I was a pretty quiet kid, and I understand why I didn't really make many friends during those times. The next 2 and a half years of high school was hell, I made a few friends here and there but I didn't feel much of a connection with them, which was probably also my fault. \n\nDuring those time the things that kept me going was video games and my old friends, every weekend I would go to an internet cafe playing CS over and over and over again and somehow it never got boring. Over time we stop playing, little by little my friends stopped playing games and we lost contact with each other, they were growing up, until it was just me left, sitting alone in an empty lobby. My depression and social anxiety were slowly worsening and I didn't know how to stop it, I remember it clearly when I used to cry my self to sleep every single week because I just kept thinking about how worthless I am, it only got worse when I started considering suicide, luckily I tried to avoid that option at all cost. My perspective on life was very dark and depressing, sunny days didn't feel right, weekends got tiring, my school work was just a distraction from it. \n\nThat changed recently, I found a girl sitting on a bench with her hands on her face, I didn't know why or how I was able to muster up the confidence to talk to this girl, I just did. I guess it made me think to myself \"If I was in that situation, what would I want people to do.\" I talked to her, tried to comfort her in any way I could by telling her that it's all going to be alright, that you just have to hold on a little longer. She told me her name and I treated her with some coffee near the campus, and before I leave, I gave her my number just in case she needed someone to talk to. After that, I really didn't think that much of it, I just went home and did my work. A few days or so later, I got a text message from an unknown number, at first I didn't know who it was until she told me her name. We started talking to each other more often, at first it was awkward but I felt comfortable being around her and vice versa, I'm not going to go into much detail about my relationship with her, but talking to her and facing my anxiety was the best choice that I ever took in my entire life, the world seems to be less gloomy when I'm with her. Please if you are suffering from these types of feeling, I beg of you try to seek as much help as you can, what I find very effective is helping others even if you're scared to approach them. I may not have many friends, but it only takes one person to make a change in my life. It's been 4 months since we are together, I spent the summer with her and it was the best month of my life. I know that I'm young and that I have a lot of time to figure things out, and that's true, I'll try my very best to fix my life from here onward.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSorry, I'm not that fluent in English.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf you want to talk about anything, I am here, I'll try to respond to every message I can.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThank you for reading my story, I know it was probably a mess of a paragraph but I just felt like sharing this experience so that people could somehow find hope in it.

And I have practically no friends. This is either due to unfortunate circumstances of my own doing or mostly things out of my control. Either way, i am learning to accept the role I've played, however big or small.\n\nI've been in two relationships that were long distance and both have ended terribly. I've learned a few things from both, but the most prominent for me is \"Never put ALL burdens on one person\" and since I'm obviously here in the subreddit, I'm incredibly lonely. They were my only source of reliable therapy sessions. Why would I seek professional help when I have a girlfriend and a therapeutic confidant? Right?\n\nWell. Bit of backstory, I haven't been single since I was 18. I never truly experienced the single life and the freedom it has. And after my last relationship ended recently, I made it clear to myself that I would improve myself, for myself. \n\nThat means, therapy. Making friends and not being lonely all the damn time. Having an exercise routine. Finding hobbies that I enjoy solely for self entertainment. Practicing self love. Etc.\n\nI know for sure I'm a handsome guy so I won't be lonely too long. Especially once I start college. But I need to put the work in. I'm lonely because of ME. and me alone. \n\nI guess what I'm trying to say is that for me, and for a lot of you guys, that loneliness can be beautiful. A time of reflection, and introspection. A time to adjust to yourself and realize what you want from life. I don't know. It's 5:40 am where I am currently and I just felt the need to type this up.\n\nMaybe as a way to feel a bit less alone.

Life is so beautiful, so wondrous. I'm so glad you shared your thoughts. To simply read about your path touches my heart.\nKnow you have a community you can always reach out to when life gets tough. It's so easy to get caught up with the anxiety the mind has created; and moreover, to get so sucked in, so engrossed into that emotion that life simply becomes anxiety. But know that is never the case. Peace lies within that anxiety. It's often hard, and we often don't want too, but look into that anxiety. Ask yourself, as you would with a friend in distress, \"Why mind do you feel anxious? Please tell me. I want the best for you, but tell me why you feel this way.\" And rest there. As a friend who is trying to collect his thoughts, allow the mind to rest and settle. Then the mind will speak, and simply listen. The Buddha wanted us to investigate our suffering.

Loneliness is somewhat familiar to me, as its an endless battle to see who comes out on top; some days are harder than others. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI exercise regularly, enjoy my hobbies, have a good job in my field of study, and have friends that I meet around once a week to hang out and get drinks with. If anything, to anyone, and sometimes even to me, I seem to have things under-control.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBut damn am I lonely. I have always been the one to observe them come together, fall apart, turn into something beautiful, or devastating but never, ever been a part of one. Friends tell me there's no real hype behind it, and its overrated, but sometimes I want to get a taste of that chaos just so I can have my own opinion of it, not someone else's. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo I set myself on the much-advised path of \"loving oneself.\" I used to be a couch-potato who only cared about video games and anime, but I steeled myself and started exercising regularly (I still do), I limited the time I spent on the computer, I started socializing more, actually went out and realized drinking wasn't about alcohol but the people you drink it with, and threw myself outside of my comfort zone, applied for jobs I didn't think I would get (and got one!).   \n\n\nNow did the loneliness magically disappear as I become more confident in my self worth? Nope. It was still there, mocking my efforts to champion it. I would try not to think about it and throw myself into the healthy routines and habits I had created for myself to no avail--it would only serve to hold it off until the moment I wasn't doing these things--it would come back with a vengeance. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI don't want to be lonely anymore guys, It sucks. I'm at a loss. \n\nHelp.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI apologize if this post seems a bit ramble-y, it is coming from a genuine place.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTl:dr  \nSociety tells us not to base actions upon loneliness because the actions that result from it are not coming form a good place. I have tried my best to try and focus on myself and \"love\" myself to not much success. I  don't know what to do anymore, it just feels like I'm just going through the motions. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nPS: I have never had suicidal thoughts nor considered myself to have depression.

I've sulked and bitched on here, I've tried offering condolences here, and occasionally lurked intermittently on this sub for a long time. Definitely a year. Maybe even two. Idk. /u/iPercussion suggested making this sub more about how not to be lonely; this has been brought up multiple times, but it's going to take a bit of work to do so. And more than just one poster. So I might as well share a successful attempt of mine. I've been to a few concerts before, but not many. More oft I pass up on seeing bands I really like because it would mean going alone. Those missed opportunities still bother me at night. But damn social convention, I want to see X-Ambassadors.\n\nI showed up almost late, and hit the first barrier: My coping tool, my phone, was dying. I needed to save at least 5% of battery to get to the thruway after the show, and it had 21% after the drive, down from 51%. Second barrier- unfortunately, I don't turn 21 til August, so I got an X marked on my hand and was restricted to the underage areas. Third hurdle- it turns out there were many opening acts- not just the silversun pickups- and the first act didn't start until half an hour after the listed start time. It would be many hours before I heard what I came there for. At least there was a 'carnival' theme- dancers, cosplayers, jugglers, etc to entertain the audience between sets.\n\nI tried to ignore what felt like eyes glaring at me when I'm standing alone, imagining all the people around me were wondering if I couldn't find my people, or if I was just a weird loner. I shook feelings like that off throughout the night with \"well, I'm a guy who looks old with a big stamp on my hand saying underage. They're probably trying to figure that out.\" Plus while it sometimes feels like theres this primal predator lurking behind people,  really, it's not there. They're focused on themselves, their friends, and the music. \n\nI'll admit, hours and hours of listening to bands that weren't advertised, standing in one place, got me a bit frustrated. Show was 6-11. 5 hours of straight standing, nowhere to move to, listening to mostly meh bands, although the first opener got me with their first song:  [\"no one likes the opening band\".](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAxYwx_lIyA) When X-Ambassadors did play... it was like being woken up from a waking dream.  A large part of solitude comes from feeling no one around you understands what you are saying. My favorite songs are ones that lessen that feeling.\n\nSince it was a small venue, I could actually see the members and hear them naturally. Their energy was great, and throughout the night I had been hesitant to move, to clap when the bands ask you to- I have haunting memories of teachers and peers laughing at my lack of rhythm so I don't usually dance or clap- but with the first notes, that melted away. I found myself 'singing' along. My boredom of standing through hours of music with not a single friend or internet distraction had been melted away and turned into excitement, and it felt like their set ended as quickly as it came- the music had washed away any sense of time. My voice was hoarse and breathless. That hour of music made up for everything else that had happened that night or even that week.\n\nDepression, loneliness, stress, etc are all becoming a public health crisis; I think it's fair to say most people know or are someone suffering from one of those or know someone who passed away as a result of those three. Nothing is a substitute for honest medical help, but if you ever truly love a band, if it's songs are the literal bright notes of your day, if they make you feel for once in your life you are not alone in your sentiments- go see them. Don't give a fuck if you're going alone. Find your medicine, use it.\n\nEdit5: Removed about four paragraphs of filler", "subreddit": "lonely"}

I didn't have much of a social life and I had practically given up on making friends because every friend I made I was only able to keep for a few weeks. I found her one day and we just clicked. I was scared since I had given up on trying to make friends. But she was such a bundle of joy that she made me forget I was ever alone. I hadn't received attention like what she gave me for a long time. So, I legit fell in love with her in just a few weeks. This was different though, I didn't want to have sex with her or even a relationship, I just never wanted her to leave me. I had a really good thing going with her for like 3 months ( do remember that this was a one of the longest friendships I've had ever ). I did a lot of favors for her, did assignments for her, helped her with tests and stuff. This was all regular for me, I didn't think much of it. \n\nBut, right after we were done with the semester and went on break, things fell completely apart. It was all good, until one day she seemed really off while we were chatting late night. I started asking what was wrong and she wouldn't tell me. I begged her to tell me why she was sad and she still wouldn't. I met her the next day and she literally shut me out. I saw her buying some food and I went to confront her. She wouldn't talk to me and I literally chased her to get her to talk. And it did create quite a scene, people were staring at me and laughing but I didn't care. My friend was sad and I didn't give a shit about anything else. But while I was chasing her, she told me that she didn't want to be with me anymore. And it tore me to pieces. I just stood there, frozen and allowed her to walk away. She didn't even look back. Later in the day, I texted her to ask if she wants to remain friends with me and she simply said \"no\". And I legit started crying tbh. I felt used that till the time I was doing stuff for her, she stayed with me. But as soon as we went on semester break, she told me that she didn't want to be with me. This really hurt and a week later I found out something.\n\nBasically, I was with someone who was also friends with that girl. The guy told me that there was something wrong with her medically but she made that guy promise not to tell anyone. I was dying to know what she had. The guy went to the bathroom and left his phone unlocked. Me being the fking weirdo I am, I checked his phone and turns out the girl was vomiting blood and stuff around the time we started having problems. She had migraines and shit too. The message said that she was scheduled for an MRI the next day. \n\nI'm really dying to ask her what the results said. But I'm not even supposed to know. What do I do? I feel used and betrayed but I still care a lot about her and blame the illness for her reaction. I really hope that some way we can get back together. She was my last attempt at friendship.

Lost someone close to her. I make an attempt to make her feel better. What the heck am I supposed to say or do? \"Uh, sorry about that\". She probably becomes extremely irritated. A normal guy would know exactly what to do and the right thing to say.\n\nScenario #2: She brings a couple of her friends on an outing. Damn it. I can't do this. Not with my anxiety. I don't know these people, and I'm awkward enough as it is. I would be known as the quiet weirdo. A normal guy would be able to get along with her friends and make normal conversation.\n\nScenario #3: She wants me to meet her family?! There's no way in hell I'm doing that. I would mess up big time. What if I say something wrong? What if I accidently bump into something? What if I'm too quiet? Her family would eventually end up thinking I'm pathetic. \"Get the hell out of our house\". A normal guy would have no problem getting along with her family and knowing what to say.\n\nScenario #4: My family wants to meet her?! Definitely a big nope. My family still knows how immature I am even at 21. Yeah I graduated college, but I'm an introvert and like staying inside all day. \"Doesn't look like you're mature enough for a girlfriend\". A normal guy would know exactly how to introduce his girlfriend to his family.\n\nScenario #5: Someone (probably one of her friends) is trying to frame me and make it look like I cheated. I become shooken up, not knowing what to do, where to even begin, or how to prove my innocence. Even though I know it's not my fault, I would still be blank and scared out of my mind. The one who framed me would reign victorious, and I would lose. \"I trusted you, so stay out of my life\". A normal guy would be able to stand up for himself and know how to prove his innocence.\n\nI could probably imagine many more scenarios, but I wouldn't see anything going right for me. So yeah, because I have no experience with girls whatsoever and because I'm socially awkward with severe anxiety, I know for a fact that even a first girlfriend would be a fail in itself. Yes, my unattractiveness is holding me back from even getting in the door, but then my anxiety and awkwardness would make the experience unsuccessful.

I see this community as a safety net--no one truly wants to be here, but they find themselves here when there's nowhere else to go.\n* You do have less social support when you cut away from communities like these.

Cutting away from that source of comfort was hard at first. \n* The best approach isn't to go cold turkey on these subs, but limit how much you use them. Moderate your use.

I thought I was doing great at first.\n\nBut when I got there and when they greeted me, I just felt... so... out of place and like I didn't belong.\n\nI looked at them and they looked and sounded so different. No surprise, it's been years since I last met them in person. But it was still so jarring. I remembered when they were a little more... I don't even know how to describe it. I'm really at a loss for words.\n\nThey offered me a smoke and I turned it down since I don't smoke and I was never really sure when they started smoking. We sat in their room, they quietly played games on their PC and I just sat in the back looking around, glancing at them, and just... thinking. I saw a large array of wine, I saw a tattoo on them and I had no idea they even had tattoos, I saw condoms laying around, I saw notification letters and trinkets and drawings and...\n\nI just felt so impossibly out of place. Even just setting aside drinking and smoking, two things that have never been up my alley, I just... I don't know.

I'm feeling like just throwing in the towel again. Like I can't handle how much catching up I need to do because even if I caught up in terms of life stuff, I'd feel so incredibly out of place and like a stranger in my own skin.\n\nThey tried to be courteous, or as courteous as their personality permits, offering to make some lunch and stuff.

These kinds of things are familiar to me the first pact I made was 8 years ago I was failing high school and made a pact with Lucifer, it worked. Later I continued working with Lucifer for money and business purposes the wishes all came true. I never thought about using Demons for finding love because I thought it wouldn't be necessary boy was I wrong. I hope this will work and won't end up in a disaster.

Most people are living off their parents so they don't need to worry about paying bills or anything like that. This is the one time where you get to live your life to the fullest because you aren't an adult so you'll be let off if you do something wrong. You're allowed to be immature at this age, you're allowed to still be learning. You don't need to have your life figured out. \n\nMost other people during adolescence are in some sort of friendship group, they're going out every week partying, they're talking to the opposite sex, they're building connections, they're laughing and messing around in class. They aren't uptight. They aren't depressed or down. They're living their lives. Adolescence is also the time where you also have most energy, where you still look youthful, where you have a full head of hair, where your body isn't covered in stretch marks and where your skin isn't loose and saggy. \n\nI know I vent about this same issue a lot but I just regret wasting this time so much. I wish I'd just been a normal teenager. I wish I'd worn nice clothes, done my hair up, wore makeup, spoke to cute boys, put myself out there, played sports, etc etc. I just wasted that time. It sucks because I'm never going to have the opportunity to be around people my own age ever again. If I go to work, I won't find people to befriend or date because they'll be focused on doing their work, they won't care about making friends at that age because they'll probably already be in some sort of social group from their own adolescent years. If I join some sort of sport or hobby now, it won't make a difference because everyone else will be in their own social groups and cliques they already formed during their youth. I had such a magical time in my life to make friends and build some sort of community for myself but I completely wasted it and now I'm alone. My own parents are trying to kick me out of their house so I don't even have family to rely on. Just completely on my own. I wish someone would just end me already because I know I don't have the guts to do it myself. \n\nTL;DR: Adolescence is meant to be the time where you look your best. It's the time where you're surrounded by people your own age so you have the opportunity to make friends and build a community. It's the time where other people start their first relationships. I wasted that time and I'm never getting it back.\n\nEdit: this is just a vent post. It's me pouring out my emotions and maybe finding someone who relates.

I have a weak memory, and success is 99% reflected by how good your memory is, honestly. I completed a year and quit, I will be attending a different college in September to try and restart doing subjects I enjoy more. Talking of this, ALL YEAR in college I was stressing about the exams which were ages away. Whilst nobody around me was bothered about them.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**The price of living is too high**.

Well I finally met her and as is typical of my meme of a love life it didn't go well. \n\nWe decided to all meet up last minute to play bowling. The cast of tonight's story is myself, my wingman, his GF, my best friend and mystery girl. \n\nNow everyone had met up the prior week except for myself since I was at work. The way my wingman had talked about mystery girl was that she had a lot of similar interests as myself and we had a similar sense of humor. While they were all together she had said she was really interested in meeting me for those same reasons. \n\nWe get to the bowling alley and it was booked out so we went to the arcade instead. \n\nOnce we are at the arcade mystery girl and I haven't really had a conversation or talked aside from saying hi when we first met. This is about 5-10 minutes into the night and mystery girl and my wingmans gf decided to play an arcade shooter. I decided to make a joke which boiled down to me explaining how to hold the guns in a satirical voice obviously not knowing what I'm talking about. Mystery girl didnt like the joke since she interrupted during my tangent saying \"Honey, I've been shooting guns for over 12 years.\" \n\nMy Wingman and I decided to walk away and he said \"My GF did say she might act like this. She's never had a boyfriend or kissed a guy so shes a bit defensive around guys who are single. Basically instead of directing the conversation to her just try and talk to us about something shes interested in and she should participate in the conversation since it's about something she likes.\" I decided to listen to him since I had no reason not to. Throughout the next hour he tried every avenue he could think of to get her involved in a conversation where we would finally hit things off to no success. \n\nNow it wasn't because she was shy or nervous. She was quite the talker but only if I wasn't in site and it was only ever to my wingman's GF or him. \n\nAt a later stage my wingman decided to play pool and offered to do a guys vs girls game. Mystery girl strongly refused saying she hated pool. We decided just to play by ourselves while the girls went off and did their own thing. As our game was coming to a close the girls came back and said they wanted to play now. \n\nAs my wingman,  best friend and I sat down and waited for the girls to finish up this next notable event happened. My wingmans gf mentioned how mystery girl was planning ahead like she did with card games. My wingman saw this as the last entry to a possible conversation with mystery girl and myself since he knows I have an extensive TCG history and am an active TCG  collector. He then asked.\n\"Oh, do you play yugioh or something?\"\nMystery girl responded with\n\"No, she means casino card games like poker and blackjack.\"\nNow I love poker and blackjack and saw this as my possible gate way into a conversation. I said \"well we should all head to the cas after this then and play some blackjack.\" \nMystery girl just ignored me and my best friend and wingman just look at me with looks of well we tried.\n\nAfter that game of pool mystery girl decided to go home early instead of joining us for karaoke. We all walk to where her car is parked and where my wingmans gf's car is parked and mystery girl talked the entire 10 minute walk there to them while my best friend and I just looked at each other like what switch just flipped then. \n\nAll in all it still didn't matter about how much we had in common or how much my wingman tried to get me a chance. She decided from the get go she didn't want to even humor me a conversation the entire night and mostly ignored me. I just don't understand it and I probably won't understand cause not even my best friend could understand why she acted like she did. \n\nThanks for reading this tale of another failed attempt.", "subreddit": "ForeverAlone"}

I just rattle about this house drinking and talking to myself these days.\n\nI didn't realise I was going mad, it seems to have just happened. I originally came on here today to say I cried. I dont know the last time I did but man it was a bit of a release. I know what it's like, I'm a guy single 32 no hope. I feel all the pressures from family and society you guys do. I also I understand that for my generation there isn't much hope, we got shafted in terms of jobs, no education? No hope of career progression. I was on my way to being a mortgage advisor, the bank got fucked and so did I. I stack things on shelves now. I'm grateful for the job but I didnt see this coming. \n\nI guess what I'm trying to say is we need to find those small releases. If its crying, drinking smoking I know some are bad but does it help from time to time. Try it. Not the drugs, the crying, try it man please.", "subreddit": "lonely"}

She's just the cousin of my sister's husband, just a year older than me, and she came to visit. For a while, I was so weirded out by my own reactions to her every time she spoke to me, I couldn't understand why I was acting and feeling the way I was. But now I think I know what is it about this girl that filled me with butterflies every time she talked to me, and I kind of hate the answer...\n\nShe treated me normally.\n\nThat's really all that happened. For the first time in my life, a cute girl didn't ignore me or treat me like a weirdo. She just talked to me like a normal human being, as equals, and seemingly enjoyed our conversation a little even.\n\nThe reason I hate the way I feel, is because it reveals how little positive female presence I've had in my life that I'm thirsty enough to start falling for the first girl that \\**doesn't*\\* treat me badly. It's the common fall-at-first-sign-of-affection syndrome.\n\nWhat I like about this feeling though, is that it's... really good, and comforting, and peaceful, and makes my chest expand and feel warm in ways I never thought it could. It's a new feeling. I've never actually felt this way before. Never truly felt that I liked someone enough to want to see them again, and never understood 'love', and even if this feeling is temporary, at the very least it allows me to see that this feeling is possible. It's like a new horizon had opened up for me that I didn't know even existed.\n\nSorry if you think I'm creepy (I've been told that before, as you can probably imagine, to the point that I can't distinguish what's creepy or not anymore), but I just write my feelings as they are. I just felt like I needed to share my feelings. Just writing in my journal doesn't feel enough sometimes and I feel like I need someone else to listen.\n\nThanks if you read so far.\n\nEdit: WOW I didn't expect this to get so much response.

Someone to come home to, to tell them about my day?\n\nPart of me thinks it is due to feeing left out of the inner circle, I don\u2019t really have any other friends, I clearly haven\u2019t had the interest of a woman in years let alone been touched or hugged in the last eight years... \n\nI don\u2019t want to be alone like I was...

I'm turning 24 in August and I've never had sex until February this year.\n\nActually during last October I already had a desire of losing my virginity to a hooker but I was too hesitant to give it a try. I looked up to different forums to gather suggestions and it's about 50/50, some people suggested that losing virginity to a hooker makes you even more lonely and some said it's okay.\n\nAfter a long comtemplation, I decided to give it a try in January. Since I have an uncircumcised penis, I was extremely nervous trying to put my penis in the hooker's vagina. She told me to relax but my anxiety kicked in (good timing huh). My penis got soft quickly. I tried to put it in few times before I finally gave it up and jerked off instead. I was embarrassed even though she said it's okay.\n\nMy penis was letting me down but my desire of losing my virginity was growing strong. I visited another hooker in February. My mental state was better than the last time and she's very patient trying to teach me what to do step-by-step. I successfully cummed in my condom which I didn't notice. I was thrilled for finally losing my virginity but right after I left, the loneliness loomed in my brain. It's the feeling that hurt. Few minutes ago I was still having sex with a woman. She even called me \"hubby\" but I know we are just client and server, nothing more. There's no love between us.\n\nI did have sex with another hooker that month but I realized that we're not enjoying it.

She dumped me because she didn\u2019t think I would be successful and make a lot of money, even though we had an amazing relationship otherwise. We tried to stay friends but eventually she didn\u2019t want that anymore and blocked me on everything (other then my phone number).

Working on my novel, hanging out with friends. It was all I needed.

He invited his different girlfriends during that period to our dorms and we watched horror movies obviously with me being the third wheel on my bed and them standing a few feet away from me. I spent years copying this chad's moves, clothing, manners. Nothing improved. We kept hanging out together but for some reason girls were only interested in him. They never showed the slightest interest in me. Usually this Chad guy was nice to me except when he got mad or when in a big company decides to joke about me - saying i'm funny looking and so on - that i'm looking like a giraffe on a picture, occasionaly he would see a very unappealing girl with mustach or overweight and will tell me jokingly this is your girlfriend. Yeah I get the gist, I'm ugly. Even though before college I didn't think I'm that ugly, I thought I was average. I tried to max my looks by working out and wearing styling clothes but this doesn't fix recessed chin, crooked teeth and big nose. \n\nAnyway I drifted from the topic.

I cuddle my pillows, fantasize about scenarios, listen to BFE audios and I would always find myself hoping to find love one day. But when it comes to the opposite gender, I'm just... Awkward. No matter how hard I try. I'm an 18 y/o straight girl and I still find it hard to make or even maintain eye contact with guys. Flirting is a definite mess for me if done through conversation but through text, I'm very smooth. When it comes to romance, my defense mechanism just shoots through the roof and I unconsciously push away anyone who comes close :( This eventually led to people to stop pursuing me romantically because they think I'm just playing with them or that I'm just emotionally unavailable. Countless times already I've wondered to myself, \"what am I doing wrong?\". I've been trying my best to overcome this but it's been tough\n\nBasically, my hopeless romantic side is amplifying my loneliness each passing day.

The smallest things annoy me such as my siblings when they do minor things, if anyone jokes around with me I take it offensive and get aggressive, then get yelled at. Which then I take being yelled at to heart and start having negative thoughts about myself. I now live with my parents due to being unable to afford an apartment with no roommates, after I was previously living with a sibling (who lives now with a friend). I help out a little and pay bills each month so I'm not living rent free.\u00a0\n\nPart of why I can't afford is because I have never had a real job but make money by reselling video games and electronics for the past 4 years locally and online, wanting to even have my own store, but that's not enough. It doesn't help that I feel picky about job searches. I don't want to work at a fast food restaurant, cleaning jobs, manual labor (construction, lawn, outside jobs), etc. I don't mind retail as that's similar to selling stuff and I even applied to many places, and even went on an interview at an electronic store that I thought went well, despite being extremely nervous prior. I got a rejection email a few days later. I am tech savvy and feel like I could do better in an office setting or doing something with computers, but when I see job requirements I feel very overwhelmed and under qualified because I know there's always someone much better than me and that I have no \"actual\" work experience apart from interacting with customers for sales, and some volunteering I did before and a school club I was in, even though I'm told to just apply and be confident.\n\nI have never had any internships either and I'm now trying to apply to them and prepare. But feel overwhelmed and like I'm not good enough, to the point I get scared that I won't have any kind of job related to it after graduation. I am in school for Video Game Design, but I feel like crap compared to peers who I know some constantly work on their craft, had some internships, and are way better than me. That really discourages me. I make my own small games too (for 7 years already) but have not in a long time due to lack of energy and ideas, apart from school group projects and game jams, which in the end of those I am always told I do really well and the people loved having me in their groups. I mainly focus on the art and design aspect.\u00a0\n\nI never really had a social life ever, no friends apart from very few \"school friends\". I have never had a girlfriend either and probably I never will. I have been on only 1 date, 2 years ago with someone from online dating, which I will never do again. (girl was way different in person and seemed rude texting the whole time, plus people never respond). I also wasted time on a girl (online) for 6 months after that who actually talked to me first but I pushed boundaries when she wasn't really quick to respond to me due to work and I'd constantly get mad. Eventually she changed her number and ignored me. I even started doing crappy in school at that time since I spent time stalking her and gained weight (I have since lost nearly 20 pounds since and am doing much better in school.) I figured I will never talk to a girl again after that point. I have seen guys who look way worse than me with good looking girls so I wouldn't really get desperate or lower my standards. I feel like I'm an average looking guy though sometimes I feel like I'm really ugly (If you really want to see me, PM me) I actually missed chances with some really nice girls who seemed interested in me during Middle and High school because when they'd talk to me I'd start acting really weird and push them away. Same with when people tried being my friend sometimes. I am very shy and socially awkward. I am also afraid of showing people how I really am.\u00a0Nobody wants a negative person with probably nothing to offer anyone around them. They want confident and non clingy people. Sometimes I am content with being alone and just accept the fact, but other times I long for people and feel like crap especially when I see couples and attractive women in stores, school, or on the bus, etc. You can't depend on others for happiness as they say.\n\nI can't drive due to a minor vision disability so therefore I am almost always home unless I have to go out. I have hobbies and interests such as retro gaming, making &amp; editing videos for youtube, computers, game design and producing my own music MIDI's, drawing, and watching TV (mainly cartoons), but lately all I ever have energy to do is lay in bed and daydream of the worst scenarios, and therefore I only do things if it's for school. I feel like I am not good enough for anything and quit easy. I feel even worse when my younger siblings have real jobs, could drive, and are very happy often and they do not let things get to them. I don't want to feel like this anymore. Sorry this was long.", "subreddit": "ForeverAlone"}

Anyway, I met a girl at work that I finally had the guts to approach and talk to. After a few stumbling, awkward conversations because of my natural social awkwardness, eventually she would approach me to start a conversation when we'd work together. I was really happy because it seemed like a girl genuinely enjoyed my company since she'd seek me out to initiate conversations. Anyway, as we talked, I found out we have a ton in common as we both like video games, like to banter back and forth, and have easy, natural conversations. I ended up falling pretty hard for her.\n\nCurrently, she's taking some time off work during the summer because she's been burnt out with college and work she needs a break so our only way to stay in touch is through texting. I usually have to be the one to initiate text conversations, but on a rare occasion, she'll text me and start the conversation. Either way, the conversation usually only lasts a little while and while she starts out engaged and actively contributing to the conversation, she quickly seems to lose interest and eventually stops responding all together. This has been going on the entire 2 months we've known each other even before she took the summer off work. Additionally, I had invited her to do things outside of work one-on-one twice and she declined both times saying she had a lot to do that day. Now, we have hung out outside of work twice with mutual friends from work, even once when it was planned and arranged by me, so it seems she's not completely opposed to doing things outside of work with me, just not one-on-one.\n\nAnyway, I finally decided I needed to give myself an ultimatum. Now, I genuinely enjoy being around this girl and I do firmly believe that I'd be perfectly okay just being friends with her if she doesn't want to be more. That's perfectly okay. I'm always open to new friendships and I've been able to put my feelings behind me with girls in the past to just be friends with and it's worked out well.  However, I was at a point where I was unsure if she even wanted to be friends with me so I figured, this was it.  If she genuinely likes me (even just as a friend), she'd want to hang out with me outside of work. So I decided I was going to ask her one last time to hang out. If she said no, I was just going to stop putting in so much effort into a friendship that I didn't feel like I was getting equal effort in return with.\n\nSo on Wednesday, I invited her to the movies this weekend to see the new Spider-man. Of course, she apologized and then declined saying that her parents had plans with her this weekend so she wouldn't be free. So that's it. For my own sanity, I need to just let go. It's one thing to stress about if this girl has feelings for me, but if I feel like she doesn't even want to be friends, that's a rough pill to swallow and one that I just personally can't deal with constantly wondering about. I'm still open to and hoping she'll do something that shows me she wants to be friends, but I don't see it happening. I don't want to put in any more effort and I don't want to feel like I'm forcing someone to be friends with me. She knows how to contact me and knows where to find me if she wants to be friends, but I had to let go for myself at least until she proves me wrong.\n\nMy point in this all is that sometimes you have to do things like that for yourself. It's easy for us who feel lonely and hopeless to cling to someone.....anyone. It's often not healthy though and if it's causing you too much stress worrying about if they even like you, sometimes it's best to just let them go and let them show you that you mean something to them. If not, you deserve better.", "subreddit": "ForeverAlone"}

At this point, it is widely accepted that the stress caused by loneliness decreases life expectancy, damages the physical structure of the brain.\n\n[https://www.researchgate.net/publication/273910450\\_Loneliness\\_and\\_Social\\_Isolation\\_as\\_Risk\\_Factors\\_for\\_Mortality\\_A\\_Meta-Analytic\\_Review](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/273910450_Loneliness_and_Social_Isolation_as_Risk_Factors_for_Mortality_A_Meta-Analytic_Review)\n\n&gt;social isolation odds ratio (OR) = 1.29, loneliness OR = 1.26, and living alone OR = 1.32, corresponding to an average of 29%, 26%, and 32% increased likelihood of mortality, respectively. **We found no differences between measures of objective and subjective social isolation.**\n\n[https://www.researchgate.net/publication/51500689\\_Effects\\_of\\_social\\_isolation\\_and\\_enriched\\_environment\\_on\\_behavior\\_of\\_adult\\_Swiss\\_mice\\_do\\_not\\_require\\_hippocampal\\_neurogenesis](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/51500689_Effects_of_social_isolation_and_enriched_environment_on_behavior_of_adult_Swiss_mice_do_not_require_hippocampal_neurogenesis)\n\n&gt;In addition, an enriched environment protected female Swiss mice from declining learning and memory by aging or impoverished environment (as opposed to the isolation environment i.e. isolation caused impaired learning and memory in the mice previously housed in the enriched environment).\n\nSolitary confinement has been widely studied with its potential to cripple verbal and general cognitive abilities and even induce schizophrenic-like symptoms and increase suicide-rates by an explosive magnitude.\n\n[https://www.nmlegis.gov/handouts/CCJ%20102716%20Item%203%20Dr%20Grassian%20Psychopathological%20Effects%20of%20Solitary%20Confinement.pdf](https://www.nmlegis.gov/handouts/CCJ%20102716%20Item%203%20Dr%20Grassian%20Psychopathological%20Effects%20of%20Solitary%20Confinement.pdf)\n\nHarry Harlow performed experiments in the 1950s to test the effects of raising baby monkeys in situations of isolation, social deprivation, and deprivation of love. The results showed antisocial behavior and PTSD-like symptoms present in the population exposed to social deprivation.\n\n[https://pages.uoregon.edu/adoption/studies/HarlowMLE.htm](https://pages.uoregon.edu/adoption/studies/HarlowMLE.htm)\n\n&gt;When the experimental subjects were frightened by strange, loud objects, such as teddy bears beating drums, monkeys raised by terry cloth surrogates made bodily contact with their mothers, rubbed against them, and eventually calmed down...In contrast, monkeys raised by wire mesh surrogates ...Instead, they threw themselves on                the floor, clutched themselves, rocked back and forth, and screamed in terror.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;**When Harlow placed his subjects in total isolation for the first  eights months of life, denying them contact with other infants or with either type of surrogate mother, they were permanently damaged...** They concluded                that the impact of early maternal deprivation could be reversed in monkeys only if it had lasted less than 90 days, and estimated that **the equivalent for humans was six months.**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nYou may notice, all of these symptoms are similar to those of depression. This is the DSM criteria for Major Depressive Disorder. At least 5 must be present for a diagnosis:\n\n* **Depressed mood most of the day, nearly every day.**\n* Markedly diminished interest or pleasure in all, or almost all, activities most of the day, nearly every day.\n* Significant weight loss when not dieting or weight gain, or decrease or increase in appetite nearly every day.\n* A slowing down of thought and a reduction of physical movement  (observable by others, not merely subjective feelings of restlessness or  being slowed down).\n* Fatigue or loss of energy nearly every day.\n* **Feelings of worthlessness or excessive or inappropriate guilt nearly every day.**\n* **Diminished ability to think or concentrate, or indecisiveness, nearly every day.**\n* **Recurrent thoughts of death, recurrent suicidal ideation without a  specific plan, or a suicide attempt or a specific plan for committing suicide.**\n\nBecause 4 of these symptoms correlate strongly with loneliness, it could be that &gt;90% of chronically lonely people have Major Depressive Disorder.\n\nIt is also relevant to mention that social withdrawal is considered a symptom of many different types of depression. Up until now, psychologists have generally believed that depression causes individuals to isolate from friends and family. But perhaps it is that the isolation *itself* is the cause of the depression, not the other way around.\n\nThis is not a mixed body of evidence. There have been hundreds of high-sample studies on loneliness and few have found a neutral connection between loneliness and mortality, brain damage, or psychiatric dysfunction. No study has found a negative connection between these rates. Most studies support the theory that subjective loneliness has the same effect as objective loneliness so even with social connections, individuals can still face significant damage if they *feel* lonely.\n\nLoneliness is as deadly as smoking, obesity, and poverty and it can be one of the most painful things that humans can experience. Everyone feels lonely from time to time, but the hell of prolonged periods of loneliness can be hard for most people to empathize with. That lack of empathy can only serve to further deepen that loneliness.\n\nAs social media has expanded, people have fewer friends who they see in-person. It makes it easier for our peers to ignore us in times of need, or to isolate from our peers ourselves. The population of the chronically lonely is growing and it has become an epidemic.\n\nFrom an ethical standpoint, we should consider access to meaningful and vital social connections a human right. We should consider loneliness a priority social problem. If we want to tackle depression, suicide, or even violence we should first target their major cause: loneliness.", "subreddit": "ForeverAlone"}

People can nitpick the rejections but they are still rejections. They don't know what like to be in your 30's being rejected every single time. Rejections hurt more over time and was part of the reason I gave up trying to escape FA. Remember, putting yourself out there costs money. Using dates sites if you are to get any dates costs money. We can only handle so many rejections before we give up. It's natural to give up when you put so much time and money into something without any success. I'm not saying we are entitled to successes because I know that's going to be the first thought of some people but rejections start to wear down on you. The rejections don't get easier over time.

Just thinking about it, living a life where everyone is so indifferent to you and no one would recognize you, that gives me goosebumps. I do feel lonely at times, but to be so lonely that the world will never be moved by anything I do, that alone makes me shit my pants.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo this summer, losing a lot of my friends really makes me scared of what's coming up in the future for me. I kept just one friend from high school and we recently had a falling out. I also had a couple of online friends but recently, they've just been falling away from me too. Lastly, I had a love interest that I've been talking to for 5 years now. Although we were just online friends, it was basically known between us that we would be together if only we lived closer. We also fell out together and all this happened in just a two month span. I'm scared that I've basically maximized what I person I could become. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI feel like I can't grasp why all those people in my mind are just so turned away from me. Even my online friends and the people I barely knew when I went to school, I honestly loved. I can't tell you how much I love hearing about what people go through, what they love, what they want to be, what they love or hate. Just the fact that everyone human goes home and will experience something completely different is what makes the world so beautiful to me. Even though I didn't talk to much people, I loved listening to what people had to say about their day or week. With my online friends especially, I would do things like gift them with things. I remember writing an essay for one and they got a B and were really happy since it was a boring topic. For one online friend, I gave them a playlist and I found out all their favorite songs because they told me they weren't going to get gifts from anyone else. Even for that love interest, for her birthday last year, I went back to all of our conversations from all the social media we had together and I took my favorite messages she sent me and put it in a Google Doc with a custom link so she could read them all and think about the time we had together. In the end, she seemed really manipulative to me but she was the one to cut ties. This one especially hurt me. I was telling her about how I wasn't able to talk to her for a while since I had to go through things and right when I started talking about how she was hurting me, she told me to never talk to her again. And then right after that I got into an argument with my best friend from high school and it was the same story. It was the exact second I tried talking about how they were hurting me, they told me to never talk to them again. And right after that I started losing just so many others, right around the first half of summer.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI feel my problem is out of frustration. This is the first time I've ever truly felt lonely. I feel as if I can't make people as happy as other people can, no matter how much effort I put in. It's just as heartbreaking as having a crush on a girl or a boy and just never feeling like you're gonna be enough for them. I know this is gonna sound /r/niceguys of me to say, but I wish I had the opportunity to make someone a happy person. It's kind of a big meme to be like \"hehe why can't these girls give ME a chance\", but shit. I wish I would have the chance to make someone just the happiest person alive and I don't even think I'm alone on thinking like this. I guess people feel the most lonely when they aren't able to make people as happy as they could, even when they have friends.", "subreddit": "lonely"}

When I post a rant on here (with the flair \"vent\"), that means I'm just expressing the way I feel and I'm clearly not doing great. It isn't an invitation for people to come out and start trying to argue with me as though I'm trying to have a political debate, I'm not, I'm just venting about the way I feel about my own life. The purpose of my vents are to express myself and perhaps find someone who relates or someone just willing to listen and understand the way I feel. It's quite inappropriate imo to post a one thousand word essay on why you think someone is wrong for expressing their feelings on a rant post. If you want to give \"advice\" (which isn't even wanted on vent posts) then you should do so in a subtle and understanding manner, realising that the person venting is clearly frustrated and the topic they're discussing is sensitive. You shouldn't be trying to derail that person for feeling as though they've missed out on an important aspect of their life. \n\nStop being so damn argumentative for no reason. Let people express the way they feel. Let people show their guilt, let people talk about how they feel they're missing out. It's a vent post, the poster isn't actively looking for your input on why they're wrong and why they need to stop \"moaning.\" Stop brushing people's feelings under the rug and let them express themselves goddammit. You may think your advice is warranted because you're older than the poster and you somehow view yourself as superior and wiser but in reality you're making yourself look pretentious and condescending. I'm not against criticism btw,  I just don't like it when people are obviously looking for some sort of argument when I'm simply venting my frustrations. \n\nWhen I post vents on this subreddit,  I'm doing it because I feel as though this is as community where people will understand and empathise with me the most. I'm not doing it so that I have a thousand people telling me why I'm wrong for having certain feelings and why they're better than me. Oh and if I wanted your \"advice\" (which is usually just you trying to make yourself seem better than me), I would flair my post with \"advice wanted.\"", "subreddit": "ForeverAlone"}

Sadly i didnt tell her nefore they left back to the UK and its been years since I've seen her... My 2nd crush was on a cool girl but after months of talking i confessed and she hit me with the classic \"I like you as a friend\". My 3rd one I got really close to during one of my my school year and we shared a lot in common, but she started talking to me about another guy that she has a crush on.... The 4th one just ignored me and it hurt, not even in a nice way. And finally my current one. About 3 weeks ago we went on our first date and we both really liked it. So we decided to hang out again when she comes back to town, because she went to camp. I asked her out on Sunday, but she wasnt home so she told me that we could hangout when she come back and yesterday I saw her talking/walking with another dude and i felt kinda betrayed, I dont know whats wrong with me and why am I so bad at this thing called love.....", "subreddit": "lonely"}

I was always noticeably above average, but never \"amazing\" as such at mathematics. I was one of the better students in my top level math class in my sophomore year of highschool, but now in my junior year after taking the IB curriculum, I found myself struggling because I'm not good at IB hl math. No matter, I dropped down to SL. You can still get into many nice programs in the United States with SL math, I think. I don't know.\n\nI mean, admissions officers for universities have no idea what the difficulty of the HL math curriculum actually is. I talked to an admissions officer recently and queried her, would she prefer a 5 in HL math or a 7 in SL math? Which of the two would be viewed more competitively? She said that both were great scores, but she'd prefer to take the student who got 7 in SL math and a 3 or a 4 in either of those courses would be what would make her worry more. The thing is that a 4 in HL math is actually harder to achieve than a 7 in SL math is.\n\nI got told by a US university counselor at my school that I couldn't handle engineering if I couldn't handle HL math, but if that's the case, why did I hear an anecdote from my math teacher about a student who got into Warwick (British university) with a 5 in SL math, that being a school far more competitive than I'd hope to get into and with a math grade below what I'd expect to be getting in the future? Tons of kids do standard A level math and get in as well, and that's a syllabus even easier than SL math. So what's the scenario here?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI guess another thing that universities in the United States are supposed to take into account is extracurriculars. Seems like a fair way to differentiate the students who sit at home and play videogames all day from the students who do productive work, right? Unfortunately, no. In my experience and opinion this only benefits kids with highly liberal parents and highly competitive extracurriculars. I know that if you grew up in the Bronx, they'd probably take that into account if you're applying to MIT, and you weren't president of the robotics club or something. But I'm growing up in bloody Dubai, I'm going to one fo the best IB schools there is (even though it's one without great STEM resources), and I hardly have that many extracurriculars. Why is that? It's because my parents haven't allowed me to partake in those activities. We have the finances for sure, and I honestly have the time as well. It's just that they'd rather have me spend that time sleeping or working on schoolwork, the latter of which they view as the most fucking important thing next to oxygen (and the former as something to supplement the latter).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThere are so many things I wanted to do and wish I could do that I haven't been able to do. Join the STEM society at my school (which doesn't exist, despite my best efforts), build a tube amplifier (which they never allowed me to do), join a robotics club (a waste of time, apparently) etc. These are all things universities will take into account alongside my grades, which would make sense. It makes sense. The good grades I have are in subjects I like and have liked. There has been no variance in my interests throughout time. They have always been two things; history, and science (mainly physics). I don't see my interests changing, not saying they won't, but I'm not giving the \"other paths\" a try because I have no faith in them. We need more engineering historians in this century, anyways.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMaybe I'd be into sports if my parents didn't prevent me from playing them when I was growing up, probably. I'm okay with being a chubby binge eater #fatpride\n\nI'm not okay with having my interests and desires robbed off me, and if that's going to continue to be the case through my life, why even try?", "subreddit": "lonely"}

The first two years of it weren't too bad. I was dating regularly and connecting meaningfully with people but for some reason... the last two years have been dire.\nMost days I'm alone. I work from home (something I'm trying to change) and the only single friend I have, I see for about 2 or 3 hrs at the weekends. Sometimes weekly, sometimes not. \n\nI live in a small town. No particular \"social\" events I could sign up to and meet people like me. \nI've just turned 30. I'm a big introvert. \nI have Tinder and [I don't think I'm particularly unattractive ](https://www.instagram.com/p/BeE21mijfBV/)but I still struggle to get matched with people I find attractive. I'm not very picky either. \nBut I've been single for so long that (I've always had it) it has made my depression a lot worse. \nI try to treat myself to days out. But they don't feel fulfilling. They don't bring me happiness. \nAnd I'm always wishing I had someone to share them with. \nI'm getting more and more depressed. Feeling really low these days. It's affecting my personality as I just feel \"boring\" and \"uninteresting\". Which in turn affects my self esteem and self confidence. Which then affects any chances at dating and my overall mental health. \n\nSo I just feel lonelier and lonelier and like this situation will just keep \"getting\" worse. \nIt's one of the biggest causes of my depression so it's something I try to work actively on. But at the same time... at times it hurts so much to go on Tinder. Seeing people I could see myself with and would make a great fit and... just be completely ignored. \nI take \"breaks\" from using Tinder. Sometimes for a few months. But it just makes me feel worse. Like I'm losing months of my life on \"breaks\" and forcing myself to step away from things and be emotionally unavailable... when I'm available and looking. It's just what the situation drove me to do. \n\nWith the depression and loneliness I just feel like I'm losing my passions too. I don't think I have many dreams anymore. My passions lie in all sorts of geekery, animals, art, food &amp; music but how do I meet like minded people through those? Where I live it's pretty dire. \nThe prospect of signing up or going to events with the purpose of finding someone seems weird to me too. \nA 30 year old guy, standing there alone, striking up conversations with random girls in hopes of eventually landing a date? It feels weird to me. \n\nBut all I know is that every night I just lay here... in a very low mood. Going into panic/desperation/crisis mode. \nTearing up alone and having a weird and painful crushing feeling in my chest. \nI feel so down it gives me strong headaches and makes me nauseous at times. \n\nAnd... yeh. I don't know what to do anymore.", "subreddit": "lonely"}

I\u2019m not the most attractive human, but I\u2019m ok, and I like to think I have an ok personality as well. Lots of times I guess I lack confidence to speak to women and \u201ctest the waters\u201d so to speak. It\u2019s like I need a fresh start, all the girls who know me from school i feel awkward contacting, or they are in a relationship, or blah blah blah (lots of excuses) but i have a hard time meeting girls as well, I\u2019m not legally old enough to be going out to bars, i work, i have college, etc (more excuses I guess) and i don\u2019t know where to begin online. It seems like a lot of Russian porn bots and not a lot of real life women. I just need a body, somebody I can hold and lay with and be there for and love and I don\u2019t know where to find it (here comes the actual point of this post I\u2019m ranting because I\u2019m sad, sorry)\n\n\nSo a few days ago, i was partying with a cousin of mine. She was dog sitting for somebody and my parents are on vacation so I decided I\u2019d hang with here for a few days. So at this party, she invited a few of her friends from her school over (most of them I know because my cousin and i are extremely close, pretty much brother and sister) but she brought over this new girl whom I\u2019d never met before, and she was amazing. She\u2019s beautiful and intelligent and kind. We didn\u2019t even talk that much the first night but everyone came over again for RD 2 the next night and we started talking more. Still looking back it isn\u2019t that much only a few hours and a lot of it wasn\u2019t even one on one but I really thought she was cool. By the very end of the night everyone was in bed and I was laying on her lap while we were flipping through some music and signing songs together. Her lotion smelled so good and all I can remember from that night is that last image as we hung out. I never knew I needed that in my life so much.\n\n\nI always thought I didn\u2019t need/want a girlfriend or anything like that, because I\u2019ve gone so long without one. But just being in her presence changed my life even if we were both drunk and just doing whatever.\n\nThe problem is now I\u2019m worried that I will never see or talk to her again. I followed her on Instagram the next day but there\u2019s really nothing else I can do. Like I said she\u2019s my cousins friend and I can\u2019t just DM her because I don\u2019t want to make it weird. Does she even think of me or was she just drunk too? Would it be awkward between any of us? \n\nI barely knew her name and now I can\u2019t stop thinking about her as I lay in bed and cry rn. Maybe this says something about me because I fell so fast. I never get attention like that and I crave it so so badly. I want more and more but it seems so hopeless. I\u2019ve got nobody to share my problems or stories with and I don\u2019t know what to do. There\u2019s so much more I have going on than this but i think a shoulder to cry on and an ear to listen would help so so much\n\n\n\nIf any single person read this I appreciate you so much, I know this was a massive rant but I needed to get this off my chest \u2764\ufe0f\n\n\nTLDR: I fell way to fast for a girl I can\u2019t have because I crave female attention. I don\u2019t know what to do.", "subreddit": "lonely"}

The thoughts dont stop. Every fucking day. I ask for affordable or free resources. Well I live in the middle of nowhere with no car so of course the resources they sent me were not any help at all. They sent me links to chatrooms and apps that are supposed to help. I tried, I gave it my best shot, but it was honestly no help at all. It made no difference. \nHeres some background. Ever since my ex and I split last september, things have completely collapsed from underneath me. I lost my house, then my job, then a lot of my support system. I went to the hospital for a few days because of a mental breakdown and thus a stress induced kind of psychosis. While at the hospital, I learned my mother dropped me from the insurance plan. So now I'm jobless, out of my emergency funds, and insurance-less. I had nowhere to live, so a good friend of mine offered me a room in his house. Problem is, it's in a pretty small town called Athens, TN. Finding work has been hell. I got a job serving tables at pizza hut. I made no money in tips and was taking home $45 checks for 50ish hours of work. It was stressful, I was loosing my mind and I decided to leave. Go ahead n tell me a little bit if money is better than none but I'm telling you keeping a job that toxic and barely getting paid is far worse. I've lived here for about two months now, paid slightly less than a months worth of rent and been eating food other people buy, and I feel guilty as all hell for it. It's probably my own projecting on to others, and I know this, but I am sure my friend is sick of it by now. Nobody is made of money and living is not free. I've been job hunting nonstop. I've applied for every gas station, drug store, grocery store, and fast food place in town. Nobody is even giving me an interview, nobody seems to be hiring. I'm trying my best. But I've been trying my best for so long I've got next to no faith left. The urges to self harm have overcome me multiple times. It's hard to get out of bed now, I force myself anyway. It's hard to eat, it's hard to sleep and when I do I will literally sleep for anywhere from 24-32 hours straight. When I'm awake, all I can think about is how I'm nothing but a burden and how much better off everyone is without me. I try to relay this information to the few people I feel still have hope for me. They have no new advice. I truly feel as though I am going to take my roommates gun and kill myself any freaking day now. I find myself wandering into the room and reaching for it without even thinking some days. \nI feel as though I'm in dire need of serious counseling. I need help. That's so blatantly obvious. But I dont have any resources close enough by for me to walk to, and even if I tell a hospital I'm going to kill myself, they wont admit me without insurance or income I'm sure. \nSo what exactly do you do when you need serious, professional, inpatient treatment and just do not have the opportunity or resources to go and get it? How do you deal with this when you have 11 cents to your name? How do I fix myself because I just dont know. I dont want to die but I dont know how I can go on living.", "subreddit": "lonely"}

I began hitting the gym and I mean really hitting it. I worked out five days a week for an hour and I put myself on a high protein 1200 Cal died. Meanwhile I began taking showers and properly grooming myself. I would also spend any chance I could talking to strangers bin public to work on my confidence.\nI also began slowly working on this girl, she sat next to me and I made it a point to talk to her every class. We studied multiple times together and I even got her number.\n\nAfter 3 months of extreme self improvement I lost 50 lbs and gained muscle, I can talk to people with no problem, and have no hygiene and grooming problems. It was all pointless.\n\nThe girl I liked never talked to me again after the semester ended. I figured \"hey you spent all this time, let's keep trying\". I tried dating apps and that was a joke. I figured my standard were way too high so I spent a ton of time just swiping without looking. No matches. I even spent money spotlighting my account and being able to see who swipes me, not a single person. I even got a stupid message congratulating me on how many people saw my profile.\n\nWell there goes 3 months down the drain.", "subreddit": "ForeverAlone"}

I don't think so, .. hope not ..\n\nBut I think being alone is really cool.  People who are alone get to be all mysterious, and they can do whatever they want and nobody is there to stop them, they can just decide to change something and change it and not care what anybody else thinks about it.  Want to paint the cat pink ?  Can do.  Want to lay on top of your car ?  Can do.  Want to go somewhere and skip rocks on the water ?  Can do.  There's nobody around bitching, complaining, nobody to tell you that you're wasting time, or that you need to go to sleep, or what to eat, nobody throwing guilt trips on you, trying to manipulate you, ... you're just there on your own doing whatever.  I think this is great, if you are alone then it doesn't even matter wtf other people think.  If you are weird looking, so what, why do you care, you aren't hanging out with anybody anyway, who cares if you look weird ... the cat doesn't think you look weird.\n\nIt seems like people who are alone get to learn directly from reality, because they do things themselves, and get to be super self-confident because they are the ones who are doing what has to be done.  It gives you a lot of time to learn to trust yourself when you are alone, because if anything is going to get done, you're the one who is going to do it.\n\nForeverAlone is an opportunity.\n\nI think I felt like writing this because so many of the posts in the forum seem so dreary ...", "subreddit": "ForeverAlone"}

I ended meeting a girl through my parents and we lived together for a summer. However, her and my other friend became really close.

I started to feel inadequate starting Sophomore year of my High School. I was popular for being a fun guy in the school, but was very awkward when it came to talking to girls.\n\nAs with any teens, there were many girls I had a crush on back then, and I asked them for the school dance or for a date, but I was rejected every single time, eventually leading me to not go to prom, and probably graduating as the only guy in school who didn\u2019t get the dating experience. This one girl, let\u2019s call her \u201cMonica\u201d, left me the biggest scar. We attended the same middle school, went to the same church, went to the same tutoring center, and shared the same interests. Both of us were Koreans, save for the fact that I moved here and she was born in the US. We previously had many small talks getting to know each other better, and my feelings towards her grew stronger. I eventually asked her out and at first, she said some reasonable excuses. Monica did eventually tell me she wasn\u2019t into me, and I wish she would\u2019ve been honest with me at the beginning instead of toying with my feelings (I don\u2019t think it was intentional, though). Not only that, she dated and eventually married one of my closest friends. He was and still is a great guy, and I wished the best for both of them, but that just left me a big scar in my heart. It took me 5 years to get over her.\n\nAfter high school, between college and work, I had no time to care for dating anyone. I mean, the first major I chose had class with little to no girls, the girl I met at work was already in a relationship, and when I was home I was too tired and felt miserable.\n\nFast-forward to present, I am still in college because of major change, still live with my parents because I don\u2019t have a career job to afford my own place, I stopped getting taller after 5\u2019 2\u201d, stress and lifestyle made me overweight (not obese, still fat around belly), socially awkward and staying quiet in the corner during gathering, and I turned to watching porn every night to forget about the pain. I did go on a few dates here and there, but nothing lasted more than a month.\n\nNow, social awkwardness, watching porn, and overweight I might be able to change. But the fact that I\u2019m 5\u20192\u201d, Asian, still virgin, and having little to no dating experience makes me undesirable, whether it\u2019s dating app/site or real life. Those two factors alone are what gives me no chance in dating, and it discourages me to change other lifestyles mentioned above. I am jealous of all my friends who are in relationships; Not because their significant others are hot or good-looking, but because they seem so happy together. They seem to know what they are doing after all the previous dating experiences they had, keeping their lovers happy and committed to their relationships. One by one, I see them getting engaged, getting married like Monica.\n\nMy sister jokes and asks me \u201cWhen are you going to bring home a girl?\u201d or \u201cAre you not going to give mom and dad their grandchildren?\u201d I used to laugh at the questions as well, but it is starting to look like that\u2019s going to be life...forever.", "subreddit": "ForeverAlone"}

Some people don't get a happy ending where they end up finding a person who has the same feelings for them. \n\nI used to be more emotional during this week but even with the panic attacks, I'm not in denial anymore. I know I will never truly accept being FA even at my age, but all those years where I promised myself I would do whatever it took to where the next year by the same week, I would have escaped FA just caused more pain.

I'm awful at explaining my feelings with words (I seem\n\nto be very high in Neuroticism), the only constant emotion I can make out is\n\nHumiliation.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI can't even say that I feel like I'm going insane because almost everyone feels that, when growing\n\nup at least, I hate that possibly everyone has the same problems as me. When those shite self-help\n\ncompanies have the same cut and paste responses to all problems to ever exist it absolutely\n\ninfuriates me, the most common being \"You are not alone, plenty of people feel what you feel\".\n\nI'm trying to think why it angers me and put it into a short sentence but its not coming to me,\n\nthis will probably be a common thing I say throughout this because my thoughts are so disorganised.\n\nI've looked through so many self-help websites and have found almost nothing of use, I can't identify\n\nthe problem so how am I to solve it, I've listened to a lot of Jordan B Peterson for a long while and\n\nhe has helped me the most so far so at least I have that.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm scared of becoming resentful but I feel I am anyway, I hate most things I'm very irritated often.\n\nI know I have the capability to kill someone and even enjoy it, more so family and friends than\n\nstrangers which is something I'm quite ashamed about. I think about murdering a lot, getting caught\n\nup in violent daydreams and become extremely excited by them (not sexually so far), I also have common\n\nextremely vivid nightmares; which have involved beating my mother to death, getting my jugular ripped\n\nout messily with plier cutters and getting so enraged at my sister that it actually started to scare\n\nmyself, enough to wake me up. My dreams often are dystopian versions of life paired up with separate\n\ndreams of me in the center of made up humiliating events or sometimes about insects attacking me for\n\nsome reason. I don't really know what dreams mean or if they're helpful in anyway but here they are.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI've lost so much as a kid, I had a beautiful 2 story house in a nice suburb and a secure family,\n\nI had many other things that weren't just materialistic but the point is that my family and I lost\n\nmany privileges when my father left to never return, its been about 8-12 years I think since then.\n\nWe moved to a little house that we could afford and if my family wasn't a bit of a mess before it sure\n\nis after that. I've had to cope with so many shitty step-dads who made my life miserable until\n\nmy mum finally decided to go out with someone sane, that relationship didn't last long though which\n\nreally pained me because I thought I would finally have a proper father figure in my life.\n\nI plan to talk to my father one day and ask why he left, which I think is because of me, i'd explain\n\nbut that's to much context to go over. I guess I feel quite guilty for ruining my family, which I've\n\nonly continued to ruin over the years, its not like they've given me a reason not to do so since\n\nall they do is make me miserable, now that I write that I notice how selfish that is.\n\nI never got to say goodbye to my father, it took me awhile to realise he wasn't coming back,\n\nI don't think my mother told me for whatever reason maybe to \"protect\" me or something, all that did\n\nthough is make me more bitter.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI can't trust my friends and end up isolating them, going cold when they ask whats wrong. I feel\n\nso distant from them somehow physically as well as emotionally. Anytime I talk I feel humiliated, \n\ninferior perhaps? Anyway I don't feel like I'm even on the same planet as my friends, I don't\n\nunderstand them and they probably don't understand me either, they say I'm very weird and mysterious\n\nto them so I'd say I'm right. I'm almost always dissociated from them or anything really, I don't\n\nknow where I am or who I'm with, I mean that somewhat literally, I'm just so confused.\n\nI often lose focus on what the date or time is, one day could go by and it feels like a week,\n\nI've forgotten the year before which surprised me, I am just so lost.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI don't know why I feel so humiliated and I don't know how to explain it either, that feeling might \n\njust be so ingrained in me that its become part of me, whatever it is its driving me crazy.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI have these moments where my body goes cold and weak, objects seem unreal and I can't really make\n\nout what they really are as they expand and shrink at the same time, at these moments I feel the most\n\nconfused, I'm completely lost in my surroundings and my body itself. It usually happens when I'm by\n\nmyself and am stuck in my thoughts for a while.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf I could meet my young self I would tear him apart with my hands, I fucking despise myself for the\n\nshit I've done, I can't trust myself to do anything anymore because of my fuck ups and the reactions\n\nI got from them. I just shut down now when anything difficult comes my way, I can't trust others to\n\nhelp me so I'm just stuck in that mode until I slowly get through it or the time passes and I\n\ndon't have to worry anymore. The only thing I know about myself is that I'm pathetic.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhat am I even thinking anymore? I really just want to die, I know it will be painful but everything\n\nis painful anyway, I feel like my whole nervous system was designed just to feel pain: I have barely\n\nbeen hugged in my life, maybe If I do so I might have something to live for. Its something so small\n\nto ask for but I never ask anyway, so I stand cold seemingly forever. I am so cold.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI want to scream. Can I even feel? All I do is feel without understanding. Everything I write still\n\ndoesn't feel like me. Does everyone just feel this and live with it, why can't I.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy friend, possibly best friend I don't know, is probably going to die soon. He's always ill probably\n\nbecause he smokes all the time, and I don't even care. If he died I really don't think I'd care, I'd\n\njust have a lot of spare time on my hands I guess, I don't even think I like him. He actually asked me\n\nif I'd care if he died (he probably expects the same thing as me), and I basically said \"not really\".\n\nI'm just such an evil person, I'm pretty much this guy's only proper friend and that's what I do to him.\n\nHe's on anti-depressants and he lives in absolute hell and I don't even care. When I grew up and looked\n\nback on all the humiliating shit I've done I told myself I wouldn't repeat it, yet here I am.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOne of my few early memories is back when I was nine perhaps, I was waiting for a friend to come over\n\nand suddenly started crying for no reason. My mum, confused, asks me whats wrong. I really didn't\n\nknow what so I just stood there crying for ages till I blurted \"I don't want to live\" or something\n\nalong those lines. My friend arrived at that moment so my mum went to open the door as I wiped the\n\ntears as to not embarrass myself, my mum hasn't ever mentioned that moment since, I don't know how\n\nsomeone could forget something like that. My mum thinks there's something wrong with me without\n\nme saying anything remotely personal since so maybe she does remember or I'm just so broken that its\n\neasy to tell, I don't know.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI wish I could be close to someone, I say this but I don't respond to peoples messages so maybe that's\n\na lie, I really don't know how to be open and I wish someone could just teach me how.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI could actually have a future, I'm somewhat a musician, I'm in a band that's horribly failing and I\n\nreally just want to ditch it but I'm going to set something right in my life for once and turn it\n\naround, god I'm for once going to do something right because unlike the doomed and hopeless I actually \n\nhave a chance. I'm an artist as well and I could really do something with my skills, make a side career\n\nout of it maybe, its not like I'm bad at art I just don't work hard enough, I actually have hope.\n\nI really have a chance if I can just live through it.", "subreddit": "lonely"}

I don't live in a country you can move out right away after university.

I remember in the first year of university she told me I am gonna get a girlfriend and have amazing experience in university because on campus everyone would be my age and practically everyone finds a girlfriend there and definitely there's gonna be someone for me. I was skeptical even then but then she pointed some examples at me how her friends kid did it, her other friend's kid did it and so on. \n\nBut now after 5 years when university is now over and most likely due do depression I'm gonna work a dead end job with minimum human contact and socializing she tells me this.\n\nLittle does she know I've been feeling like that ever since the first year of university. I've been hurting ever since the first year. That's when I was sure that even if I spent 10 years in university I am not getting a girlfriend. All my collegues got one and I was standing there seeing it happen. Seeing the way girls look at them but it never happened to me. A girl never looked at me this way.\n\nSo here we are now. I've been hurting but now my mom tells me this and it really hurt. Every time I got back from university she kept telling me when you get a girlfriend you will have kids, you will do this, and that. But maybe she thought I had one there in the campus. Now I see in her eyes looking at me she'd lost hope. And even if I knew for myself it's not gonna happen. Seeing the last person who ever thought I could get a girlfriend give up on me sucks as well. And on top of that she is sad. Like me being sad about the life I have and the fact that it's slipping, I'm wasting it, my youth and all and I can't do anything about it is not enough but now I have to care about her sadness and she's gonna be depressed too.\n\nI was annoyed and even though I've never told her before I confessed: It's never gonna happen, don't be blind, I am ugly, stop saying that I'm handsome, the fact that I haven't been able to get a girlfriend for 24 years, a girl has never expressed a single hint of liking me (i'm not oblivious, i can pick up on signals, unlike other guys) tells me that I'm anything but handsome.\n\nThis got me even more depressed and I don't know what to do anymore. \n\nI'm in pain for not being able to find a girlfriend for me, I feel awfully lonely and in dead end with no way out.\n\nI'm in pain for my mother who tells me now has nothing good to look forward in life (something I've been feeling for years but haven't shared it with anyone).\n\nEvery day and night is pain.", "subreddit": "ForeverAlone"}

I of course do not mean simply therapy, bad experiences of groups, hospitals, mental health nurses or workers, all are common enough. I am not badmouthing treatment of course, the people who are currently helping me are wonderful, therapy for 2 years in October and its been life changing. But my only other therapy before this was 10 sessions of generic talk therapy, vaguely CBT, 12 years ago when I was 26. I have always had issues with self care. He became physically aggressive and stood up and threw me out that first session, said I stank and to come back when I was clean. I did, because I did not know their were other options or that referral was even a thing at the time.\n\nOn the second session he told me we were absolutely not allowed to discuss trauma, indeed he said we could only discuss things that had happened since I moved the the community 4 years earlier when I was 22. I did not want to piss him off, he could be quite harsh, and I pretended to be okay, which caused us to run out of things to talk about within 15 minutes, so by session 3 we has come across my interest in military history at that time, and we ended up speaking largely of his experience as a young man in the war in Vietnam.\n\nAt a certain point in therapy I had bought bad shoes and thrown out my old ones, I was limping quite badly and worried I my foot may be permanently crippled from the bad shoe, he explained that was entirely possible and I just needed to accept it. He never mentioned the limping again, and when I got better shoes after a few weeks when my check came in and began walking better he did not mention that either. When therapy ended he did not tell me anything about referrals at all, simply told me the government would pay for 10 more sessions a year, that I could come back in 42 weeks. He implied I had no choice but to go back to him, and that was it. I did not go back and try therapy again for a decade.\n\nAt the time I figured it was me, that I was fundamentally broken and assumed his technique of tough love was valid, I was an autistic man living on disability in a rented room in a boarding house, and he had a Masters, I figured if the tough love did not help me I could not be helped. It was only 10 years later when I made my first and only suicide attempt by jumping from a bridge made me desperate enough to try therapy again. I should say he also openly mocked my autism, at least once a session he would physically mimic some of the stimming or body language or my way of speaking.

Most people speak a sort of halfway personal dialect that they create themselves, but if you manage to learn how to speak \"clean\" that would go a long way to make your voice sound more masculine. If you speak the standard america dialect, learn to speak it perfectly, if you're in the south, learn the southern dialect, or midwestern, new york, wherever you were raised is good.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhen you feel a lot of emotion you can widen your pronounciation and make it more pronounced. When you feel very tense or unemotional, nervous you can tighten your articulation. This helps express your emotions and make it easier for people to read you, though you have to do it in a dignified manner, and it doesnt sound very good if you don't speak cleanly. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHow you articulate words also stem from your understanding of the english language, if you have a very thorough understanding of a word, you will articulate it in a more resonant way. Your experiences and knowledge will shine through in your speech patterns and also the way you think will factor in. If you have a lot of complicated thoughts, learning the english language will help you express those thoughts more clearly, and everybody appreciates intelligence even if they might seem dismissive of it sometimes... \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHopefully you appreciate my guidance, I hope it can help someone who feels like their voice is \"whiny\" or \"high pitched.\" Anything can be learned, it might take a lifetime to learn to behave like a normie but it is worth trying...

Interestingly enough whenever I stopped trying, things started to improve with girls and once they did, I would get sucked back into the whole thing. Once I was sucked back into it and started caring, things would change and I would again be back to saying \"I'll stop trying forever\". I've realised that this wasn't a solution though because the main problem was that I was afraid of rejection, I felt that being rejected meant that I wasn't good enough. But through meditation and reading ancient Greek philosophy and some spiritual books, I stopped fearing rejection when I realised that It actually meant nothing about me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhen someone rejects me, they aren't really rejecting me because they don't actually know me. Mostly they just aren't physically attracted to me, which sucks but it's also fine and only fair since there are a lot of girls I'm not physically attracted to either. Reading things like this really helped me: \n\n \"Ugliness has nothing to do with your body. Neither has beauty much to do with the body. The beauty or the ugliness of the body is very superficial; the real thing comes from within.\" - Osho\n\n It sounds like a \"cope\", but It's true. Someone can be physically beautiful but very ugly on the inside, this actually is the case often.\n\nAnyway, I realised that it isn't really the rejection that used to hurt, it was my *thoughts* about the rejection. Basically when someone rejects you it's like they hand you a knife, and it's up to you to decide what to do with it. You can cut yourself with it, or you can throw it away. To make sure that this realisation wasn't just empty words, I decided to test myself by putting myself in situations where I'll get rejected. I joined tinder, bumble and so on, and it happened. I got ignored by girls I messaged who I'd actually met before, didn't get many matches on tinder, when I did I also got ignored there and I wasn't hurt. I observed my thoughts through all these situations and saw that my thoughts were the problem, so the key was to *not identify* with my thoughts and just observe them indifferently. This will need to be explored in a different post though, if you are interested in this kind of thing. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm okay with [being alone](https://open.spotify.com/track/01iOt9kebrIfNnTrcMPi7w), and rejection doesn't hurt anymore.", "subreddit": "ForeverAlone"}

She was beautiful, smart, funny, we had almost all the same interests, had similar views on the world. It was the best years of my life (even with the shitshow with my family). Three months before grad I proposed and she said yes, made plans to leave the day after grad.\n\nShe had been abused by her father for over ten years when I met her, how she ever came to love me (man) I\u2019ll never know. She told me she felt safe with me. What I didn\u2019t know was he had also been raping her for the last four years. I knew she was terrified of her father but she was to scared to leave (what if he found her). She never told me and I never had the slightest inkling that it was that bad.\n\nTwo weeks before grad I hadn\u2019t heard from her in two days. We never went a day without at least a phone call (she was homeschooled). I got really worried so I rushed to her place. Heard screaming and sounds of a struggle. Smashed through the door only to find her father standing over her in the bathtub. He had tried to rape her again, she couldn\u2019t take it and slit her wrists. Needless to say I beat the living hell out of him, making sure to bootfuck his genitals. She died in my arms.\n\nHer father was killed in prison before he hot to trail. I was furious! I wanted to kill him! Took me many years to date again.\n\nMy first marriage lasted less than three months. We had been seeing each other for two and a half years, exclusive for nine months beforehand. After we got married we moved to another province. I couldn\u2019t find a job right away so she had to get one. Two months later we moved back, into her parents place. A week after returning she left to visit a sister. And fucked every guy at a party. \n\nWorst thing was she was pregnant (mine) but didn\u2019t tell me. I only found out AFTER she gave it up for adoption. I ended up getting my child but for (many) years after I had ZERO trust in women. I would date but only for the physicality, whenever it started to get serious I\u2019d end it.\n\nI\u2019m married again, been together 17 years, three kids. And I\u2019ve never been more lonely. I almost left eight years ago because she became distant. She promised to get help. Things were better for a while. Four years ago she started again. Been three years since we made love, been two years that we\u2019ve even hugged.\n\nI think the only reason I stay is because a: I literally have nowhere to go (have no family I care about) and b: I\u2019m a coward! 45 with health issues that prevent me from working full time. Take $500 a month in meds that I wouldn\u2019t be able to afford without income assistance.\n\nSo here I sit, day after day, in the couch watching Youtube videos or, when not to hot, in my shop woodworking. We might see each other two, maybe three hours a day. Don\u2019t really say much to each other that doesn\u2019t revolve around kids/bills/menu...\n\nI have no friends. Moved around so much I just stopped trying. The few I have had, most betrayed me one way or another, resulting in me having zero trust in anyone.\n\nI am in no way suicidal, goes against everything I believe (I\u2019m atheist btw), but every morning my first thoughts are, \u201cDamn, I didn\u2019t die in my sleep...\u201d But every day I just keep going.

During the minute that it takes me to compose this sentence, thousands of animals are being eaten alive, many others are running for their lives, whimpering with fear, others are slowly being devoured from within by rasping parasites, thousands of all kinds are dying of starvation, thirst, and disease. It must be so. If there ever is a time of plenty, this very fact will automatically lead to an increase in the population until the natural state of starvation and misery is restored. In a universe of electrons and selfish genes, blind physical forces and genetic replication, some people are going to get hurt, other people are going to get lucky, and you won't find any rhyme or reason in it, nor any justice.

I feel like what I really need is a group of friends I can be with, thats what I think will make me happier atm. Ive pretty much deliberately avoided actively seeking romantic relationships because I dont think I am in the best state for that and I dont want to put any of my baggage on anyone while in a relationship, Id much rather be in a good state of mind before entering the dating scene. I just wish I knew how to find real friends because it seems so hard and so time consuming to find out whether someone is really your friend. Maybe my reasoning is flawed to prioritise friends over a relationship but I feel like this is the way for me.", "subreddit": "ForeverAlone"}

Doubt follows leading to questions that weaken self-esteem. \"Was I not interesting enough, did I say something wrong. what could I have done different?\". As confusion mounts rage and hate build. When every attempt at socialization ends with a cold shoulder it's only natural to seek warmth in the heat of rage. Yet if rage is not expressed it builds up inwards, a consuming fire that burns what's there to ashes. Depression sets in like an airless crater, choking out any hope of a new rising flame.\n\nThis is the cycle that all sorts today find themselves in, and I have experienced myself. Lack of connection between people has left many in despair. Yet these same people go on to do what was done to them. Seems a poor strategy for making the world a better place.\n\nStriking at the root is usually my first approach when looking at a problem. So what is the root of people ignoring other people? Let look at this in a list of generalized possibilities first.\n\n1) A person is ignored because they lack interesting engagement.\n\n2) A person is ignored because they are socially undesirable\n\na) Rude\n\nb) Low Class\n\nc) Embarrassing To Be Around / Lacking In Social Awareness) Makes Others Uncomfortable) Annoying Mannerisms Or Conversation\n\n3) Outside circumstances\n\na) Technical difficulties\n\nb) Technological difficulties\n\nc) Personal issues\n\nd) Outside opportunities / Cost - Benefit Analysis in terms of time and focus.\n\n4) Nervousness\n\n5) Lack of shared frames of reference\n\n6) irreconcilable differences in personality style and temperament\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSome of these will cause obvious emotional pain to the ignored while others are easily brushed off. I will focus on the more judgmental and therefore more emotionally volatile.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt is the judgmental types of ignoring and implicit rejection which cause the spiral of self-doubt. When one believes they are judged unfavourably the first reaction is to question what caused such a judgment in the first place. Yet it is more wise to first ensure that a judgment has indeed happened before jumping ahead to a place that will harm self-esteem. \"Why was I ignored?\" is a valid question yet if never explicitly answered worthless to chase.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe only ones that can directly answer are the ones that ignore. If it is found out that they indeed judged you wanting in some area you must ask \"Are they fair, reasoned and of sound mind?\" instead of \"what did I do wrong?\". The fact that the majority of people are susceptible to things like advertising and other nonsense should help set things straight.\n\nThanks for coming to my ted talk.", "subreddit": "ForeverAlone"}

And perhaps most importantly, I think I'm almost ready to see a doctor.  \n\n\nOne thing that's become abundantly clear to me over the past few weeks is that I'm *fucked up*. Like, broken inside and fundamentally incompatible with anything that resembles lasting happiness. But. Depending on what exactly is broken, it might be fixable - or removable. I assumed my issues were coming from the lifetime of loneliness, but what if the loneliness *is* the issue?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\"Normies\" tell us to be happy alone first. I mostly dismissed that as fake goalposts - you're told to be happy alone before you can be in a relationship, then you work toward that and, if you can get there, you're happy, so it doesn't matter that you're still undatable. The trouble is you never get there. But they seem to expect that you could. Could they? I'd assumed not, that they didn't understand because they hadn't been through the same extended periods of singleness, but..now I'm wondering if I'm the one who doesn't understand.  \n\n\nWhat if I'm so intensely lonely because I'm sick? I've been reading about borderline. I'd always thought of it as the \"crazy ex-girlfriend\" disease, but there's so much more to it than that. The fear (and *expectation*) of abandonment. The black-and-white thinking. The loosely-defined identity that frequently and easily changes. The obsessive affection. The looking for every little sign it isn't returned and subsequent crushing despair when you find them. Cutting off relationships before they can end (based on the assumption they will, for potentially made-up reasons, as I did with my only GF ever.)   \n\n\nMost borderlines are in and out of relationships because of an intense need for companionship. What if I'm what happens when you're borderline *and* ugly, so that intense need for companionship is just crushingly unmet *all the time for decades on end?*  \n\n\nBorderline is treatable. Super treatable, apparently. If that *is* what's going on (or even if it's something else, it looks like DBT works for a wide variety of related issues), maybe being happy alone isn't actually impossible - it just requires treatment.

I'm 23 today.  I'm not sure if all of you would agree that I'm truly FA, as there was a girl who once liked me and I tried to make a relationship out of it.  Unfortunately, that blew up in my face like a nuke and messed me up a lot.  I lost a lot of the desire I had/have to find someone else.  This was a couple of years ago now.\n    \nAnymore, I don't know what I want.  Sure, I wouldn't mind to have someone to come home to, someone to do even the most mundane of tasks with.  I'd like someone to love.  But, I don't know if I even have it in myself to love someone the way I should.  After years of few to no friends, being the outcast, and capping it off with that one attempted relationship gone awry, I think I've hit my social limit and spent all of the love I had to give already.\n    \nMaybe I've become a premature wizard.  I have no real way of even coming into contact with a girl.  What few friends I have are also alone, although their hearts are much more in this than mine.  No way to be set up with someone through them.  My entire department at work is all guys.\n    \nI don't really know what happened, the spark, the desire, is just not there.  My mental health has definitely gotten worse, but I just don't feel emotionally alive anymore.  I'd like to say I prefer this to the crushing weight of being alone and still having the drive to change that, but I'm not sure.\n    \nMaybe someday I'll come out of this and want to find someone again.

I have a best female friend whom I have known for 3 years. She entered in a relationship a year ago. We became more distant since than but we still chat daily. A month back she got a great job in a different state. She wants the job, but she is not sure if her boyfriend would want to move, so she is waiting for him to decide, and the decision lays solely on him.\n\nWe were talking about how we would miss each other when she moves. After that, I said that I don't expect to influence her decision to stay here, but that I find it hurtful that I wasn't even a variable in her consideration. She replied with this truth bomb:\n\n&gt; Off course it will be hard to leave you and my other friends here, but I can't make decisions based on friendships. Things are great and fun now, but in reality, most of the people from our circle will enter relationships and get married in the next 3-5 years and stop hanging out. In that point, I would regret not leaving.\n\nThen I realized - she is right. I already \"lost\" one friend to a relationship, he only comes with us when someone is celebrating birthdays. Most of the people I hang out with will stop doing so in the future and I will be left alone. And when the friends get their children you can at best grab a coffee every 6 months.\n\nIt makes sense that even best friends will prioritize their relationships over friendships. So the statement that \"friendships are enough\" are a pure and basic lie. When in a relationship you are somebody's highest priority, you make decisions together with a plan a future ahead. Every other interaction is secondary and will be left behind if it interferes with the plans. What people her crave is to be that #1 in somebody's life.", "subreddit": "ForeverAlone"}

Rather than meeting people like my friends who also deal with shyness and quirky interests but are still balanced and witty, it's groups full of super awkward people who make each other laugh but cause me to cringe inwardly for hours and never visit again.\n\nHas anyone else who's reclusive or geeky found alternative ways to make friends?  Work also isn't an outlet, because everyone else who works at my main workplace of the past seven years is twice my age, and everywhere else I've worked in that time I've gotten laid off from.

I have not been playing sports my whole life because my parents have not allowed me to. I also do not eat healthily, and do not exercise.\n\nMy parents force me to (I mean, close to force me to - I have to practically eat everything on my plate) eat large amounts of food.

Now I would like to start playing sports etc but I fear it will be too late in university. I am 18, after all, with zero sports experience. People have told me it is definitely too late, even my university counselor told me that. They don't let me go to the gym because they believe that having muscle is bad for you, and that it's a waste of time anyways because I should be studying to get a job to make money.

I wish I'd put myself out there and made friends, I wish I'd tried to look pretty, I wish I'd spoken to boys. Everyone else has such fond memories when they look back at their teenage years- after all that was the time when they had the least worries apart from school work and all they did was go to parties, hang around with friends, get drunk, get involved in the drama. I never made an effort because I used to view everyone else as being immature and I thought I was above them. Now I realise how wrong I was. Those same people who I viewed as immature back then have actually gotten much better social skills than me now because of the way they used to interrupt in lessons and the fact that they had so many friends; this means they are much more capable of getting jobs and relationships in the future because they have such great social skills. Also, when you get older it's less socially acceptable to do certain things because it's seen as immature- you are allowed to get drunk in fields with friends when you're 14, not so much when you're 26, you're allowed to get involved in gossip and petty drama when you're 16, not so much when you're 24, you're allowed to wear certain clothes too when you're a teenager and then not so much when you're in your mid to late twenties. Those are the social rules and you have to stick to them. Most people have already met their current friends through high school, that's where they got their first initial social group and how they extended that social group. They all just have such amazing memories from their teen years but I have absolutely nothing. They're all shared memories too, most people experience them- it's normal to them to have their first kiss age 11-13, lose virginity age 14-18, go to parties and festivals and drink all the time throughout their teen years. I just don't have any of that and I hate it so much. I wish I could just go back and slap my 13 year old self into action and make her realise how important high school is in terms of making friends but I just can't now.\n\nI wish I had experienced everything about the teenage years, I wish I had a big friendship group, I wish I went out regularly, I wish I had a first kiss, boyfriends, I wish I went to parties, I wish I had been involved in drama, I wish I'd gossiped with people instead of being the subject of the gossiping, I wish I'd spoken more in lesson, I wish I went to festivals and to concerts, I wish I tried to look nice.

The universe is impersonal at its best and worst, and there's probably no divine scheme to keep me a certain way.\n\nHowever, there are times when I've felt like life just won't throw me a bone. Like every attempt I make to better myself is thwarted somehow.\n\n* I graduated two years ago and still haven't got a job in my field, and have only received offers in retail and the food service. I'm currently without a job at the moment because slaving in retail for 18 months for 40+ hours a week was destroying my soul, but my prospects are extremely bleak and I'll probably have to take another shitty job because I'm close to dipping into savings. I've watched my friends at home graduate alongside me and find respectable jobs, move out, find partners, whereas I cannot gain any sort of career traction. However, I have tried adding a few skills to my skillset and reached out to volunteer, but I won't hold my breath and don't actually expect them to get back to me.\n* I've been going to the gym. It hasn't changed the way people treat me at all. A lot of people can't tell that I go, tbh. I know dudes who bench 155 that look more ripped than me. But it feels good regardless, and I feel better in myself doing a mix of cardio and weights.\n* I read so many stories about social circles and how people meet others through partners. My social circles have been predominantly male. The women in my circles aren't interested and know no single women. At my last job I thought I'd be in no shortage of single women, but it was mostly middle aged women and guys my age who worked on my department. 99.9% of my customers were elderly. Whenever I'd go to a social event involving work, most of the time it was other guys or taken women. On the off where there were single women, they were aloof. My friend who is successful with women talked about how closed off they were around us.\n* I've tried going rock climbing and it wasn't really a good idea to date there, people were there to do the hobby. TBH, so was I.\n* I've tried going to bars solo, and I did get speaking to a few people. Dudes. The bar I frequent (because it's actually good compared to the others in my area) is a sausage fest. I went out with his group a few weeks back, and his social circle was mostly dudes. The only women were already in relationships. One of them said I look like a baby after telling them how old I was (23).\n* I've tried online dating on about five different sites, but I'll be honest I only really prioritised three of them: Tinder, Bumble, and OKC. I am currently paying for Tinder Gold and have been for like half a year. Beyond a few conversations that involve me putting most of the effort in and getting one word responses, OLD has been a fruitless endeavour. My friend met his first girlfriend on there (good for him though!) and I remember nonchalantly mentioning OKC to my female friend. She had no shortage of likes within days and met up with two guys in a short period of time. So after reading success stories on here about how they were hopeless but \"just tried Tinder\" and ended up getting a date out of it, I gave it a go. It's literally like mailing pieces of my self-esteem out to different people and having them bin my mail before they open it.\n* I've tried making myself a  more interesting person by taking up a few hobbies like the gym and rock climbing, travelling to cities on my own, hiking, dabbled with cooking, etc. I've also started a blog and share my content over social media. An article I spent days writing got no interaction on Facebook when I shared it. I understand that it's not as simple as that, but it is crushing when other people share content and it gets noticed when mine doesn't.\n* I've also brought \u00a3500+ worth of books and have gotten through a chunk of them, including topics of philosophy, politics, self-improvement, classics, etc. I feel better off for it but few people care about these things in conversation.\n\nMy problem is that I've tried to follow the advice prescribed for me and it hasn't really gotten me anywhere, and I don't really know where to go from here. I feel stuck in the mud. When you do some activities you at least see some investment/returns on them, and that progress keeps you going. But for me, my efforts haven't really gotten me anywhere. It's like taking \u00a310000 but throwing almost all of it off of a bridge.\n\nIDK, there has to be something I'm missing.", "subreddit": "ForeverAlone"}

This was the closest I've ever come to anything substantial - I truly believed this was a real chance. Thought my interest was reciprocated, but apparently not enough for them to take the jump with me. Now I'm back to square one.\n\nOver the last few years I've mostly come to terms with my perpetual alone-ness without feeling much loneliness...though sometimes I wonder whether I'm getting too comfortable with solitude. When I do find myself slipping back into existential despair, the darkness is darker, and the pain is more intense than ever before. I feel utterly betrayed by the human experience. For the people around me, it seems so simple - you meet someone, there's mutual attraction, and the rest is history. But for me, it seems like I'm trying to crack an impossible code. Sometimes, I don't even feel human. As an introvert and self-diagnosed demisexual, it takes me a long time to bond, open up and develop feelings for someone - I know this is partly to blame. I tried online dating many times, but I could never connect with anyone faster than they were willing to wait (for sex, for commitment, etc).\n\nEven though I know it's objectively untrue (for anyone!), I feel inadequate, broken, and invisible. Now as I'm approaching my 30s, I feel like I've missed out on \"young love\", and moreso I feel like I've wasted away my prime. And as time passes, I dread the increasing stigma of inexperience at my age. I already feel judgment and pity from people who become aware that I have No. Freaking. Experience. I know it's only going to get harder to find someone who won't immediately reject me for being a relationship virgin (and everything-else-virgin). I don't think I'm physically repulsive, I have diverse interests and a promising career, and I cultivate fulfilling friendships. And I do take solace in these things, I really do. I tell myself there's more to life than romantic love, but still I can't help feeling like a part of my soul is withering away. I believe I have so much to give, but no one will take it.\n\nI keep telling myself that just because love hasn't happened yet, doesn't mean it will never happen. As I get older, I'm finding it harder to trust in that truth.", "subreddit": "ForeverAlone"}

I\u2019ll give you guys the background first and then get into the event(s) that really set me off.\n\nFor starters, he\u2019s a physical embodiment of everything that I am not (except for height I\u2019m a good couple inches taller but he\u2019s a good 40-50 pounds heavier). He is about 5\u20198-5\u20199 tan skinned stereotypical guido from New York or New Jersey or something, he\u2019s got a bunch of tattoos, extremely muscular powerlifter, dark hair on the longish side and blue eyes. He was a marine out of high school so he\u2019s a few years older than me (I\u2019m 19 he\u2019s 22) and has a good amount of world experience. That by itself to me is a good enough reason to hate him, but it gets even worse. For background we are both at a trade school (which surprise surprise he beats me in knowledge and operation of the equipment as well) but we are about 15-20 minutes from a major college town and it seems like every weekend he goes out and brings back girls to have sex with him which I have to witness and hear as our place is on the small side. He has girls on rotation that he constantly is talking to and has the nerve to say to me \u201cthere\u2019s not really one \u2018type\u2019 for girls. Some think I\u2019m a 10 and some think I\u2019m ugly as fuck it\u2019s all about finding the girls who are into your type\u201d and I hate how it\u2019s so simple and easy for him to do and say. He\u2019s even actually told me \u201cif you ask me, I\u2019ve never actually pulled a girl from a bar. What I say doesn\u2019t matter, if she\u2019s into me she\u2019s into me and I feel like they\u2019re the ones pulling me.\u201d Could you imagine having that mindset? Girls actually choosing you, actually being seen as attractive to someone? He knows about my FA status and does seem to try to help me, but I can\u2019t help but see it as a slap in the face every time he fucks a random girl from the bar/tinder or invites one of his fwb over to hang out and they eventually have sex. He also has a long term fling with a girl he met when he lived in California who flys out here to stay with him, buys him things, and cooks for him all while knowing they\u2019re not officially together.\n\nNow, outside of pure jealousy of his sexual success, there is another reason I hate him. He is completely deserving of all the attention he gets, and I hate to say that. I know his background and his story and it\u2019s not pretty, years of physical abuse and poverty turned him into the man he is according to him. Here I am, I grew up with all the opportunity in the world, an only child, well off, and wasted my school years watching anime and playing video games while he worked an actual job before he could even drive to help pay bills and provide for his younger sisters and I sit there and complain about life, I have depression and anxiety, and am completely socially inept. He\u2019s also charismatic, engaging, hilarious, confident, protective, masculine, hard working, and one of the nicest most loyal friends Ive ever had. He revamped my tinder, he brings me out, pushes me to engage in conversation, includes me if he thinks I\u2019m being left out, he makes girls bring friends for me when they come to hang out even tho they don\u2019t like me because I\u2019m not deserving of love, but he tries. He effortlessly makes a good impression on everyone he meets and it seems like he\u2019s everyones friend (although I have seen him lose his temper and get in more than a few fights). Hes my gym partner and he showed me how to lift properly, he drives me to and from the gym, he\u2019s fixed my piece of shit car for free, and he buys and prepares our meal plan and he\u2019s actually a damn good cook. And I hate how he\u2019s able to effortlessly brush off criticism, I\u2019ve seen it firsthand where he\u2019s assumed to be dumb or a meathead because he does look like one, but those comments never bother him. He just brushes them off like nothing, while I\u2019ll dwell on someone changing their tone on me for weeks.\n\nNow for the most recent event, something happened that changed me and I honestly don\u2019t believe I can keep living with him. It was the week of the 4th of July, he rented an Airbnb in the city from the 3rd to 7th because we had those days off, and he brought me along with him claiming \u201cI was 100% gonna get some pussy this weekend\u201d, as if it would be that easy. Little did I know, we also picked up his friend from the marines at the airport. His friend is a short (like 5\u20196 tops) Puerto Rican guy also from somewhere in the northeast, also muscular, tan, tattoos, the whole 9 and as soon as they got together it seemed like he changed. They disrespected each other constantly with jokes, wrestled all the time, shared explicit stories about sex, and honestly besides the introductions and the occasional comment I felt completely in the background. I was out of place and wanted to go home, but I was in too deep at that point. Anyways, I ended up actually having a good time, my roommates friend turned out to be a pretty good guy and I warmed up to them well enough to be involved in their conversations and even found myself the butt of a few jokes and throwing back a few of my own. But this all changed Saturday night. We went out just like we had been, to an 18+ club after getting pretty tipsy at the Airbnb, except this night was different. This night, my roommate spotted 3 smoking hot girls as soon as we walked in standing by the bar area. He tapped me and his friend as if to say \u201cthis is it boys\u201d and I immediately started having an anxiety attack but I bit through it and followed them as they cold approached these girls. Being that I can\u2019t drink at the bar I stood on the sideline as these two effortlessly started a conversation and took shots with the 3 of them and they each pulled one to the dance floor and began grinding and making out. I was honestly speechless at how fast and smooth they managed to pull it off but I soon realized I was awkwardly standing silently next to the 3rd girl, who dragged me to the dance floor I\u2019m assuming out of pity. I tried to explain to her that I don\u2019t dance, but she wouldn\u2019t listen and just kinda danced around me while I sipped on my water and prayed I would fall dead or disappear or something. After what felt like forever, my roommate and his friend grabbed me and told me we were leaving, each with a girl behind us and to my surprise the 3rd girl was coming as well, I started to think maybe I would get lucky after all. We made it back to the Airbnb and started to play drinking games. Then one of the girls pulled out her phone and told us about a very sexual drinking game she had on her phone (basically it was like pulling a card and it would be something like \u201ctake 2 shots or play the rest of the game shirtless\u201d or \u201ctake 3 shots or French kiss one of the players\u201d etc etc) and the girl who was basically the 3rd wheel stated that she would not be playing. It was a kick to my nuts and pride, I choked back tears as I was reminded that I was and always will be a disgusting creature and failure destined to die alone. Within minutes, my roommate and his friend were full on making out with their girls. Laying them down and doing things with them I couldn\u2019t even imagine. Before long, the 3rd girl left and I was left sitting in the kitchen area alone drinking and crying. And then I heard it, at first it was quiet but soon unmistakable and I walked over from the kitchen and witnessed the worst possible thing. I saw my roommate, naked, fucking this girl he just met on a small couch a few feet away from his friend who was fucking the other girl on the pull out bed. I couldn\u2019t believe my eyes and I couldn\u2019t look away. The moans, the way they breathed and the way I could see how the girls were grabbing them were all reminders of what I will never have. No girl will ever be underneath me, gripping my arms while we have sex or bite my neck or moan in my ear. Here I was, 5 feet away from 4 people achieving what I deem impossible, something I couldn\u2019t dream about in my wildest dreams. I wished for them all to die at that moment. I wanted to cry and and I wanted to hurt them, but I realized that was selfish, so I turned away and drank myself to sleep in the living room, alone... as always. As if that wasn\u2019t enough, this past weekend his long term long distance fling flew out to see him from California. I had to watch them act like a couple and flirt with each other for 3 whole days. She would parade around the apartment in her underwear, cooking for us, she would get drunk and get touchy with my roommate and I overheard one of the worst conversations ever. It basically went like this; they were talking about money and she said she was gonna marry a doctor for that reason (she\u2019s in nursing). He said that was a smart move cause he doesn\u2019t have any money and she said she knew that she just wanted him for sex. He then said this \u201cgood, the doctor will get you paid and then you\u2019ll come to me to get laid\u201d and they laughed about it and made a few jokes about her taking a lot of \u201cbusiness trips\u201d to his hometown and how she\u2019d explain it to her husband. I feel like they were just joking cause it\u2019s in line with his type of darker humor but idk there was something about it that made me so sad. And it was the realization that I\u2019ll never be seen as a choice. He goes through life, and women WANT to have sex with him, people WANT to be his friend and spend time with him and be around him. When people are throwing parties or going out, they think of him and want to invite him. That will NEVER happen for us. We may be able to make enough money to be tolerated, we may be able to put on a persona and get a drunk girl to maybe find us attractive enough for a one night stand, and we may be able to pay for an escort. But we\u2019ll never ever be the first option, never be who they would willingly and on their own dime want to spend time with. And at least he understands that I think, he never gives meme advice. When I ask him how he picks up girls, he genuinely will say he doesn\u2019t really do anything, just talks to them or they approach and talk to him. It\u2019s a life i will never ever experience and it\u2019s a hard and bitter realization.\n\nAnyways sorry for my rant, it feels good to get this off my chest. Good luck my friends.\n\nTL;DR- my roommate is a constant reminder of all that I\u2019m not and never will be. I hate him because I hate myself that I\u2019m not him.", "subreddit": "ForeverAlone"}

Hope everyone of you has a amazing day.\nSo lately I've been feeling extremely lonely and sad, not the sad where your upset or have pity but just on how you feel like your not getting anywhere in life. Before hitting 20 and living in the adult world I was a pretty positive average guy in high school. I knew alot of people people knew me I made alot of friends I remember doing so much and going out of my way even getting beat up to defend someone from being picked on. I made two best friends that I can really actually call friends they ment the world to me, they felt like the brothers I have never had it was incredible. I felt so thankful it's weird I had so many other friends but they made me truly happy. After high school many problems have surfaced I had to move away I couldn't live with my parents, paying rent at my parents friends house became too much and difficult that my last high school year which was senior became the year depression first hit me. Once out of high school I finally got to move in with an actual family member my grandma I was so thankful. It didn't last long mid year my aunt (grandma's daughter) has a bipolar disorder so my grandma always tells me to not talk to her or get close. Of course it's my aunt so I don't care what she has I'm gonna talk to her she's my aunt I love her. Turns out it was not a good idea I got kicked out because of her and was gonna be homeless until one of my best friends reached out to me and said I can move it. I was so thankful but let me tell you moving a 90 pound bag from L.A to San Diego with no car was not fun but finally I moved to a stable household and it's with my best friend the brother I never had and loved. Only catch is he got a girlfriend after that his number one priority became her. I hardly see him and am always being left home alone or with his dad which is fine but kinda sucks cause I feel awkward just hanging with a friends dad. But even the dad leaves most the time. After a week my friend tells me how he plans to move with his girl in two months meaning I have two months to stay before he leaves and I have to leave this made me extremely stressed and upset. This is when my sense of loneliness kicked in everyone I knew everyone I helped, everyone I ran hours too just to stop them from crying and talk to them, to cheer them up, to spend all my money to get a smile out of them, I had lost touch or they are too busy to talk. I felt abandoned I didn't have any family to go to nor any friends only my two best friends one of them is far and is going to the military while I'm with one but is leaving me. Later he told me he felt bad and sorry for treating me like a roommate and he's willing to stay for a year. I felt better alot better but that only means I only get to see him 3 days every two weeks we barely hang or talk and everytime we make plans he cancels them to talk to his girlfriend. And this is my question which took so long for me to ask I apologize. Am I overreacting by feeling lonely and upset cause I have no one to talk to most of the days and I have no idea what's around me or any help since I barely have money to maintain myself. Or is it normal for me to feel lonely from this situation?", "subreddit": "lonely"}

Yet it's become a place where everything has become so.... dull. Nothing gives true happiness. Every single thing that gave me even a semblance of happiness has become nothing but a tedious task. And it's tough because everything good about my life has been destroyed a few months ago, so my anxiety and depression are at a high, sprinkled with some (a lot of) existential crisis. It's because of these reasons, I am desperately trying to feel good. But nothing helps. Does anyone feel the same way?   \n\n\nI love playing games since I was a child. Used to be a sort of escape from life. It's all changed now. I don't find the same fun and interest in them. I have Middle Earth: Shadows of War, Far Cry New Dawn, Sekiro, Rage 2, GTA V, Monster Hunter, The Witcher 3 and Fallout 4 (2nd Playthrough) and even AC: Odyssey yet I uninstalled all of them because after playing for barely 5 minutes, I begin to lose interest and quit. I don't feel happiness or fun or enjoyment while playing them. I feel nothing, almost like I'm forcing myself to play. Then I wonder if buying a new game is the cure to this. But regardless of whatever I do, I simply sit and stare at all these games and feel like there's nothing to play. After staring at the games for a few minutes, I shut down my PC. That is heartbreaking for me, as video games hold a special place in my life and I can't bring myself to feel the way I used to.  \n\n\nI love space and I loved reading science based books by Carl Sagan, Stephen Hawking, Michio Kaku, Richard Dawkins. I always found an odd comfort in looking up at the sky at night and thinking about things in a cosmic perspective. It used to make me feel good. I should get happiness from it, but I don't anymore.

I'm very picky about the people I keep around me, I'm pretty radical and I need my friends to match that energy. Now, take that and apply it to the fact that I'm a Lesbian, who went to a **Catholic** highschool in Texas. That environment was slim pickings because of the rampant homophobia, and no pickings with girlfriends. I was the only openly wlw (women who love women) at my **Catholic** highschool, which I attended all 4 years. So, that whole time I only made 2 close friends. One of those friends I had a falling out with my Sophomore year of college, and the other lives an hour away from me so we don't see eachother often. I have 4 friends in total, my best friend/roommate, her boyfriend, and my only remaining friend from highschool who lives an hour away, and my sister. I turn 21 in 2 months  so as of now I can't even go out to bars with my best friend/roommate who is 21. My friend who lives an hour away has mental health issues (and a boyfriend as well) so I have a difficult time motivating her to hang out. My new job has yet to start because their shitty HR department takes eons to do a single background check, and I'm not involve in any extracurriculars. I go to a therapist every week but the last 2 weeks my therapist hasn't show up to the appointments. The first time it happened I texted her and called, and a few minutes later I only got a single text from saying she was in the hospital. My next appointment was supposed to be today so I called and left a voicemail but she has yet to get back to me and I'm afraid something tragic has happened to her. I guess that's the main reason I'm really here, because my therapist is out of commission until further notice, and I need to express myself to somebody, in some way and soon, because I definitely spent too much time recently zoning out in a haze of depression recently. I've been using Tindr for over a year and have gone out on so many firsts dates it ridiculous. The only girl I did take on a second date moved to a school in another state up north and my most recent date stood me up. Both my best friends have boyfriends as I've already stated, and they have a great sex life too. I've never had good sex, or a serious relationship (a few months with a dumb boy in highschool doesn't count for me). I'm extroverted and make a lot of friendly acquaintances but rarely any **friends,** ya know? I'm not really asking for advice but I'd be glad to receive it. I know what I have to do, hit up my sister and old friend who both live an hour away, start my job, turn 21, join some student clubs, and go out on more dates. But rn I seem to be in a rut where I can only do 2 of those 5 things (go on dates and hang with my sister or old friend), and with the luck I've had I'm getting more and more reluctant to put my heart out there just to receive another dose of disappoint in dating. And because my sister works so much I doubt she'll be able to hang anytime soon (of course I'm going to ask anyways tho). And my old friend... it's like pulling teeth to get her to hang out. So, all in all- it sucks being gay.", "subreddit": "lonely"}

They are experiencing what we will probably never have. Then on this sub, the majority of us being normal FA'ers. \n\nNormal FA'ers might be a bit unattractive, never been in a relationship, never kissed anyone etc, but usually have normal personalities and may not have too much trouble socializing. \n\nAnd so I've come to the conclusion that there are also some of us on this sub who we could consider as \"Turbo FA\" such as myself.\n\n I believe there are different variations of this. One Turbo FA might not only be a KHHV, but has probably never even had a conversation with the opposite gender for example. For me though, I think what makes me turbo FA is not only the fact that I'm unattractive and a KHHV, but also that I'm an extremely timid person. I've made a post about it before, how I have never seen someone more cowardly or afraid of everything than me.\n\nAs an example of my timidness, someone may suddenly confront me and tears will start forming in my eyes. (I'm a male by the way). I also have no will to argue back with anyone (In real life) even if I'm right, because I fear what people will think of me. I'm basically a doormat and I can't say no to anyone even if it inconveniences me. Also not to mention, I'm also a human punching bag. \n\nSo in other words, the fact that I'm extremely cowardly on top of my unattractiveness and KHHV status I believe makes me a Turbo FA.

I\u2019ve managed to escape the \u201cfriendless\u201d FA thing in my late teens, so the problem remains only for romantic relationships. \nPlease no normie advice on how to escape FA in general, I have plenty of hobbies, a good job (software engineer), take enough showers, average looks (not overweight, 1.80m / 5\u201911\u201d) and I\u2019m also learning to speak my 5th language. Of course I have low self-esteem, I\u2019m kind of depressed most of the time and I\u2019m sure FA is the main reason why. \n\nSo my cousin invited me to this summer trip in Poland (I have some family there) she was organizing with her friends.\nI met this girl there. The reason why I started to like her was because we share common interests (she seems to be a nerd). Half of the people in the group were couples of course, and like in lot of normie social situations there was a lot of alcohol (I don\u2019t drink usually, so this was the exception). \nSo at the beginning she seemed to enjoy spending some time with me, talking about our interests. However when I started to like her, with the alcohol and all the normie advice you hear about \u201cbeing confident\u201d, I tried to show that I was interested in her by spending more time with her, sitting next to her and so on... Seems like she didn\u2019t like that because she became colder and colder with me during the rest of the trip. \n\nAlthough she\u2019s a bit younger than me (23 or 24, I don\u2019t remember exactly), she never had a boyfriend (don\u2019t know the specifics why), she\u2019s very shy and introverted and doesn\u2019t have a \u201cvery social\u201d life, she\u2019s more of a loner (the other people present were joking that the only friends she has are all present here). I didn\u2019t know all this at the time, but smells kind of \u201cFA\u201d to me. \n\nWhen I came back home, while speaking about all of this with other people they told me that I had to have hurt or pissed her in some way. So I\u2019ve sent her a message to apologize to her if I did something like that (also with the alcohol you can\u2019t be sure). She replied with a long message explaining that she\u2019s shy and she needs a long time to be confortable around someone, that she didn\u2019t like I was trying to get close to her and she started to avoiding me because I was getting her uncomfortable and she felt kind of trapped. But then it gets weird, she accepts the apology, says that it\u2019s ok and you can\u2019t change the past, and \u201cwishes me to find a girlfriend that will suit me better than her\u201d.\nI was quite occupied at the time but a couple of days later I replied to explain some things about my behaviour during the trip that it seemed she got wrong. As all of you can expect, I\u2019ve never got a reply this time \n\nI really like her, but seems like she\u2019s not interested. So I need advice from you people to understand all of this. \n\nEnglish is not my first language, so I\u2019m sorry if some parts are hard to read because of weird wording.", "subreddit": "ForeverAlone"}

I guess I want to put things into perspective first.\n\nI am 26 year old guy in a large rural city (around 130K pop.). I have a full-time job I enjoy but don't get paid well at. I own a old trailer house and it's not in the best condition, but it's my house. I own my own car and am getting close to paying it off. I have no debt.\n\nI have never had a girlfriend. Never held hands with a woman, never kissed, never even had a woman smile at me (outside of waitresses/cashiers). All my life I was always told by my mother that \"someone will come along\". I didn't really care when she said that, but I guess I believed it it up until last month.\n\nI had an epiphany. I got tired of being a homebody. I started working out in my house, doing at least 40 miles a week on a treadmill and doing crunches/squats every night. I stated eating better. I want to say I dress better, but I have no fashion sense, so I didn't really make any improvements tbh. I read *How to Make Friends and Influence People*. I cut down how much I play video games. I stopped masturbating so much.\n\nI got a Facebook finally and signed up to Tinder, Bumble, and OKCupid. I took some mediocre photos of myself and put them up. I got 4 matches (all from fat girls). I tried talking to them, but realized that I was pulling teeth trying to get decent responses and just asking them the usual questions (job, hobbies, etc). I don't really have any \"texting game\". I don't know how to flirt. Eventually I'd just give up and stop trying to talk to them. I rarely got responses to \"Hello, how was your day?\" The times I did get responses I got worthless answers that I couldn't think of how to respond to because they didn't give me anything to work with. The profiles never say anything worthwhile that I can tailor a response to. I really don't want to lower my standards to include single mothers and/or morbidly obese girls. I'm even fine with fairly ugly looking women, but I haven't even matched one of those. I feel worthless on online dating and some of it is my fault for not knowing how to text well (I didn't get a phone until I was 22). I feel so inferior to people on OLD or Facebook who seem like they have more going on in their lives.\n\nAs for offline dating prospects. No luck there. All my male friends are married and don't have time to hang out with me or they are older than me and in the same position (or asexual). My couple female friends are all married and all their friends are married or lesbians. I don't think a woman has ever been interested in me and I wouldn't know what to do even if she was. I go to a barcade pretty frequently, but everyone seems so busy or having fun with friends there that I don't feel like I have the right to interrupt them (and I'm too much of a coward to try to talk to them anyways). The people who are dancing and laughing and having a good time... I just don't understand it. I've never \"partied\", I don't get it at all. I don't know where else to hang out in public to meet new people around here.  It seems like all the women in South Dakota are dating someone already or have kids by 20 or both. I've tried [meetup.com](https://meetup.com), but nothing in my area that I'm even remotely interested in. Everything is outdoorsy like hunting, hiking, and a bunch of spiritual mumbo-jumbo.\n\nI think I'm pretty ugly, I posted some pictures on /rateme and I got 2-4/10. I started balding at 20 for fuck's sake. I said fuck it and shaved it all off. Now I look like an alien rather than a 40 year old man. Here's a picture: [https://imgur.com/a/ci6AM8i](https://imgur.com/a/ci6AM8i)\n\nOn the other hand, I have a few friends, most of which are older than me that I have made at my current job and my previous jobs that I hang out with on a regular basis, usually playing video games at my house. So I do have some friends at least. And I still have my video games and anime when I am alone.\n\nI know the rules mention this on this reddit, but the thought that other people have it worse than me actually keeps me going. I'm not dying. I don't have any diagnosed illnesses. My job is stable even if the money sucks. My life is boring from an outsider's perspective and I don't hate it. I just wish I had a girlfriend (who I can game with preferably) that is okay with an ugly, stable dude who doesn't like to travel much.\n\nI usually think that I am pretty good at socializing when I need to (at work) or building friendships with my co-workers (since I am forced to see them so often). But I am absolutely terrible at relating to people outside of work. I feel like I don't have the right to speak to anyone and I don't feel like I can open up to my real life friends so that's why I'm posting this novella on here. My apologies if you read this whole thing.\n\nI don't know what to do. I could try moving to a bigger city, but with everything I own, I would find it very difficult to move away and I would hate to leave my job. I don't want to quit my hobbies of video gaming and anime since those mean a lot to me, but it seems impossible to find ladies who are into that stuff.\n\nI'm not afraid of women. I'm just afraid of bothering people (regardless of gender).\n\nThis is a venting thread, but if anyone has advice, that is fine too. Sorry if this was a bit incoherent in some places.

I don't know what this post is, maybe I just need to have this off my chest.\n\nI have been lonely for two and a half years, and it's taking a toll on my mind, because I am struggling with the conversations and understanding others. It hurts me to always have to contact people first, yet I see the same people calling others first. And when I say I feel lonely they are like - oh, you know, we all don't have time - but that's a lie - I see them having a plenty of time for others. It's not like I can't make friends or that people dislike me - seems like the opposite, but I don't know why everyone acts like I don't exist, even if I am trying to form a friendly relationship. For all this time, for only 4 days someone gave me a minute of their attention, for all these two and a half years. When we talk it's like - my dear, but they don't treat me like I am really dear to them. It feels especially horrible, because, for almost all this time I have been severely sick - daily pains all over my body, and I lie in the bed for a long time because I am tired, having headaches, and so on... And they know it: when I call them I am always sick and laying, still, not even a one support message. It hurts - sometimes I have thoughts of sending them a message how they are hurting me neglecting my existence, and telling them to erase my number because I will erase theirs, and I don't act out because there's one hairline of hope it will be better; but it never does.\n\nDid anyone have a similar experience? How do you stay at peace with people like these? How do you find strength to continue?

I didn't take the relationship seriously and didn't put in enough effort. She used to be obsessed with me, but I took what I had for granted. If I could go back I'd work harder to keep her obsessed with me and I'd make sure to show her I felt about her. I always thought I would be thinking about marriage, buying a house, and kids by the time I was 30 but here I am, about to turn 29 and I'm single and alone living in an apartment. We used to live in a nice house that had a beautiful yard. I had an office room, a garage and things were looking good, although I didn't realize it at the time.\n\nThe friends I had been socializing with for the past few years and getting to know were my ex gf's long time friend group, and understandibly, I don't get invited to their social events anymore. Me and her met through one of my best friends from high school who is part of that group. I thought me and him at least would be able to retain a friendship but I've reached out to him and been blown off so many times that I now understand I'm losing one of my only friends as well through this breakup. \n\nI've reached out to old friends and had good conversations and caught up with them, but they are all busy with their lives and SOs. I can't pester them any more without revealing how needy and lonely I am. I'm not going to be able to build those friendships back up to what they once were.\n\nI work from home so I spend all day inside a small apartment and only have human interaction over the phone and text chat. The days are all running together. Wake up, do work that I've grown to hate, then kill time until I go to sleep.\n\nI used to be fine being alone. \"Killing time\" was awesome because I could get into a video game or something and entertain myself. In fact me needing \"alone time\" caused several fights in my last relationship. Welp now all my time is alone time and im miserable. Turns out It's not what I want at all. \n\nI feel like I've died inside. I can't entertain like I used to. All of my old hobbies and things I have such great memories of doing feel so pointless. I'll try to force myself to sit down and play games that I used to obsess over but I just feel like I'm wasting time not accomplishing anything and turn it off. All the knowlege and random skills I've been so proud to obtain mean nothing. They aren't going to help me meet anyone.\n\nI feel like I have run out of time to do anything that doesn't directly contribute to improving things or doesn't feel like \"progress\". The only thing that matters to me now is getting a girlfriend or getting back with my ex... unhealthy thought I know. She randomly texts me sometimes and says shit like she misses me and we catch up but nothing happens. Ive said we should catch up in person sometime but she hasn't taken me up on it and im not going to push it. I need to move on. I know I should be able to be happy alone but I'm not. \n\nI want someone to do things with, to travel with and build a relationship with. I've learned from my mistakes in my last relationship. The only problem is meeting someone. I just don't know how... I'm planning to do online dating but I still need to get in better shape and get better pictures before I start. Maybe online dating will work out and im complaining for nothing, but from what I read it is difficult for men, so a part of me feels like being trapped in my apartment is all I have left to live for.\n\nIf you actually read all of this you deserve a medal.\n\nPM me if you want to have a conversation about something.

It might be a long one so I get it if you want to skip.\n\nTo start, I'm turning 19 in a couple days and I'm afraid that none of my \"friends\" are going to remember. I tend to post something every year about my birthday on my socials but not many people see it and even less say something. It's even worse whenever I see people today or yesterday all over social media practically screaming happy birthday to their other friends and I just want someone I know to be that happy that I'm alive for once.\n\nNext, I'm moving off to college in less than a month now and my friends seem like they're already replacing me. I took a week long trip to California with my youth group and a new guy came along. He's a pretty cool person and I genuinely like him seeing that we're actually pretty similar, but my closest friends have seemed to have given him my spot in our trio and every time I look at their socials it's always those three now instead of me and them. I've talked to them about it and they insist that this isn't the case, but when we're all together they always talk about stuff that they did that I never seemed to get the memo about. Again, this guy is a pretty cool dude, but I wish that my friends at least waited until I was gone to replace me. \n\nLastly and somewhat along the same vein as the first thing, I always feel like I'm the second choice. It's nice being out of school and having the free time to do what I want, but I at least talked to some people while I was in class and now that we're not forced to be together, everyone seems to find their best friends and have a party or go to movies and I'm never invited to any of that. Any time I say something about it, I always get the classic \"oh we never really plan anything and it's all spontaneous\", but they always invite their friends to everything they do and I never am part of that list. I'm not asking to be part of everything I can,  I simply want to feel important to people I like and it's just not happening.\n\nAnd all of this is on the cusp of me leaving for college, so I'm even wandering if any of this is worth it. I'm not going to see any of these people for a long time, and if they don't care about what I'm doing, why do I care about them? At this point, half of me wants to leave without saying goodbye and see if anyone notices that I left. My school friends forgot me when summer started, my church friends are replacing me already, and I'm wondering if anyone's going to care when I leave.

Sometimes I\u2019ll do anything to avoid contact with them, like when someone invites me for something and I just come up with a million excuses for not accepting the invitation. This also includes situations where they just want to talk, and I just decline... \nI don\u2019t really know the cause of this behavior. Maybe it\u2019s past \u201ctraumas\u201d from school. Though, for some time, I used to overreact to jokes like an asshole until I realized it was just best to not give too much thought and attention to them. Maybe I unconsciously judge myself too good (or too bad) for friendships.\n\nSometimes I\u2019ll just ignore messages and give some half-baked excuse of \u201cmy internet was down, I just got your msg, sorry\u201d. I just don\u2019t feel like answering at the moment, think \u201cI\u2019ll do it later\u201d and forget about it or, even worse, just don\u2019t want to answer at all. FOR NO REASON.\n\nThe thing is, I just always fear what can go wrong between me and others. Mostly what I\u2019ll do to disappoint/annoy/hurt people. I keep overthinking past mistakes and I can\u2019t help it. \u201cWell, why don\u2019t I just get away from everyone? Less harm for others that way.\u201d So I thought. Isolation is better if it keeps you out of trouble, right? This raises an irrational and stupid insecurity for me, one that seems to inhibit any self-esteem I could have, since I\u2019m always fearing the worst I could cause. So I do my best to avoid making ties to others. \n\nI can\u2019t burden people with my troubles and fears though, and being an isolated, closed-off person all the time surely raises red flags and gets people worried about you. \u201cI\u2019ll need to interact in some way in order to \u201cthrow them off the tracks\u201d, making myself feel comfortable around them.\u201d Then, I came to the conclusion that being the one who makes jokes all the time was the best way to keep people off the more personal boundaries of mine. Everyone loves to laugh, right? \n\nAnd so I\u2019m the one that only matters when I\u2019m helping or making people laugh. Can\u2019t really blame people for my issues though. I certainly got some mental health problems that I don\u2019t want to face head-on. I\u2019ve been closed-off for a good bit of my life, and I\u2019m supposed to open up to a stranger (AKA psychologist) who could be judging me at every instant to get better, when the whole point of it was to AVOID such judgement from people? But, this also couldn\u2019t be the case, which would mean that I\u2019m too much of a narcissist, selfish, egocentric person to build something meaningful and good with people. \n\nThe thing is, deep down, I don\u2019t want to end up alone because of my flaws. But I just keep thinking about how bad I act with people and enter a cycle of self-loathing and self-hate because of my wrongdoings and, however I change, I\u2019ll hurt people again, and again, and again, all so I can conclude that everyone\u2019s better off without getting too close to me.

When I can start working next year, I'm either gonna save up for the Xbox One with Minecraft just so I can try reuniting with some of my best friends and have one of those \"Me and the boys\" moments.\n\nIt's been so long since I've actually seen/talked to any of my Irl friends and it just sucks, knowing that they see me as the annoying little brother and coincidentally, I am the annoying little brother. I sort of feel as if my online friends think of me like this as well and it just sucks since they're all I have since I don't have much of a relationship with my family since we all just mind our own business except for my brother and sister who are pretty much friends. \n\nI did manage to reunite with two of my female best friends (One younger by a year and the other older by a year) but apparently, the younger friend lied about me and even said that we dated even though that never happened at all. I did date the older friend though at one point since they had a crush on me and I was too scared to say no but we're still pretty good friends to this day. \n\nI usually just stay holed up in my house, on my computer or Xbox, and playing video games, watching YouTube, and talking to my online friends. My parents criticize me for doing so even though I only go out with friends about once every 2-3 months. If you're still reading for some reason, I'm sorry for how long this is but it's just sorta therapeutic to talk about some of my problems like this.\n\nI do try to go to conventions and even spent my birthday at one but even then, I still get left out the majority of times and just stick with an older cosplayer (18M) I met who also got left out from the main group most of the time.\n\nI wanted to change myself this summer by exercising to get rid of my noodle arms, using Duolingo to learn German and maybe another language, and just improving myself in every way I can but it's just turning into another summer of isolation.\n\nI always feel left out at any and all events, sorta just making me feel like that one weird person.

What happens when you've lost even the hope that you'll meet someone who actually loves you? Life just becomes a drag, and it is for most people but sex and relationships make it a little more bearable. Most people's  days are spent at a job they don't care about but they put up with it because they can make money, which they can then spend mostly in ways they can make themselves attractive to the opposite sex. So the cycle then becomes working all week and then spending that money on the weekend going out, buying drinks and going clubbing. The purpose of clubbing of course being putting yourself in places where the opposite sex is.\n\nWhat happens then you've tried all this and nothing happened except rejections which resulted in low self-esteem, when you're convinced that you will certainly [die alone?](https://soundcloud.com/remedy97/gold-in-my-soul-prod-by-sno) Suddenly, work becomes meaningless because you realise that you're working so you can keep on living a lonely life. You might make a lot of money and buy all kinds of nice things, but at the end of the day you'll come back to an empty house with no love. You'll try to distract yourself with hobbies, video games or whatever but the feeling of loneliness and being unwanted will keep being present, you're biologically programmed to want connection and intimacy after all. This is the reality.\n\nThe question then becomes; what's the point? Why bother to go on living when you already know the way your life is gonna go? For me, I've gone beyond rejection.

All my other ones were with escorts.\n\nAll my previous attempts at clubbing were a disaster so bad to the point I stopped going entirely. I don't mind getting rejected, but the inability to avoid awkward silences was killing me.\n\nSo after watching some stuff about how to act, I decided to up and go. I asked for help to a friend I barely talk to (hadn't seen him in months), and he decided to go and bring along two people: his sister and another friend.\n\nWell, I got rejected once, then the music went too loud for conversation to be possible and I didn't know what to do anymore. The training I got didn't address that. My friend and his other friend managed to hook up with two girls, while I was left alone with his sister.\n\nAnd that's when it happened. We were just talking, she started getting personal about her life, venting out about past relationships and how she wants one for life. I was like \"why don't you give us a chance?\", and she was like \"oh, but we don't know each other very well...\", and I just kissed her. I still can't believe it happened, she's way out of my league and 8 years younger.\n\nWhile I went out clubbing just craving sexual contact, she's actually someone I can consider dating.\n\nBut after that, things got really confusing. She became sad thinking she shouldn't have kissed me because apparently that'd be giving me false hopes because now she's not looking for dating someone. Which is confusing, since she had just said she wanted a relationship for life. I managed to get her number and asked if I could ask her out some other day, and she said yes.\n\nWhatever's going on inside her head, I don't know if it's something I can help her overcome or it's something I should just leave her with. Should I ask her out and see what happens, or leave her alone?\n\nWell, at least I had a really happy night and still can't get rid of the smile on my face. Couldn't even sleep afterwards from how I excited I was.\n\nTL;DR Kissed a girl for the first time, would love to go out with her again, but she seems to be going through some internal trouble.

I got a job here with people that are older than me and so don't really socialise with them because they have family's etc. So what can I do? I've tried getting back in with the old group, but am tired of trying, I have looked at starting night classes to meet new people, but some are very expensive and the actual course doesn't interest me. I can't go to a bar and chat to people because that is \"Weird\" and \"creepy\" by today's standards, so what can i do? Advice and comments are appreciated.\n\nI've decided to join a running club, as exercise is good for the body and mind and hopefully running with others will bring new social groups for me. Only one way to find out I guess? I am terrified by this, but need to push myself to get out of the comfort box that is my room.\n\nAnyway, I have constantly worked on stream-lining my life to increase the amount of time I have and work on making certain jobs I have to do more efficient. However as a lonely person with quite a bit of free time and a routine which is probably bad for me, I have decided to use this as a positive thing. I am using it to watch movies which are supposed to be great, read books and the news, this is difficult and sometimes I don't want to do it, I just want to play video games or sleep or watch TV. But it needs to be done, in order to be able to socialise I need to be able to get pop culture references and be able to relate to what is going on in the world and this is a key part. In my mind, if I don't do this I won't fit in when I do get out there and socialise (whenever that will be!), it's a small step and I am finding things I really enjoy, new writers and favourite movies (Shawshank Redemption is amazing!). This kind of growth is something that I haven't experienced in years and it feels great.\n\nIn terms of holidays, which can be a big issue for people, I recently went on a \"Contiki\" which is a holiday for solo travellers, basically a bus load of solo travellers do a certain route and see certain things etc. There is a guide and they make it so much fun, you can meet so many cool people and make real friends. It is definitely worth it, scary as hell as first - but so much fun! There are a lot of different companies that do it, can be anywhere in the world, can be as long or as short as you want it to be, so just look into and take a risk, I did and I will do another one soon and am looking forward to it. I did a tour from New York to New Orleans and visited the Kennedy Space Centre, Miami and Orlando to name a few, it was Epic!\n\nI speak to my therapist a lot about the loneliness I feel and about how I feel left behind, and honestly I'd much rather have no friends then have friends who don't make the effort. If they don't want me then I don't want them, simple as that. I know that isn't easy for everyone and everyone has their own battles going on, but I have just given up with trying to be \"in\" with the group, if they want a coffee or something then that's okay, but it has been over half a year and I can't see that happening now!\n\nI've gone on too long and I apologise for this, but the topic of loneliness is something that isn't seen as being common in millennial's. This is because people are too busy looking at their mobile phones to notice and posting on Instagram to distract them from being lonely and make themselves look more social than they are. I hate it and I hate what social media has done to today's generation.

Could I get some advice?", "author": "natantantan", "self_text": "I've always wanted to get plastic surgery. Since I was little, multiple people have been telling me I'm ugly. My physical appearance is having a serious negative impact on my life and well-being.\n\nI'm 5'8 and 135 lbs. I'm working out and looksmaxing in all way I can and the only thing left is Plastic Surgery. Recently, I turned 23 and got my first job. With this job I was able to save up to $15,000. Today, I was speaking to my HR department and it turns out that I have 11 vacation days that will expire by the end of the year. This made me realize that I can actually get the Plastic Surgery I need. \n\nCombining my PTO with some holiday days, I can take a 3 week vacation in October. \n\nThis is my plan:\n\nI live in NYC which has a lot of great plastic surgeons. However, I cannot get plastic surgery in NYC because I do not want my family to know about it. They are very traditional and will freak out. So I can't come home with a cast around my nose. \n\nThat is why I decided to do Medical Tourism. I want to use my 3 week vacation to fly to a country with a great surgeon, get my surgeon to preform the surgery on the first or second day there, and then spend the next 2-3 weeks healing in peace. Then when I come home, I want people to think I look 10-15% better but not really be sure why. Maybe its the new haircut/tan I got.\n\nThe only thing is, I don't really know where to start. The biggest surgery that I want to get is Rhinoplasty. I have an atrocious nose. The other two is buccal fat removal (I have chubby cheeks that people always comment on) and ptosis surgery. \n\nHow do I start researching doctors in other countries? Does anyone have any recommendations? \n\nHow do I find a good doctor overseas? This is very important and I do not want to cheap out on my surgeon. With my 15k and the fact that I am travelling where surgery is a lot cheaper, I am sure I can fund a great one, I just don't know how. \n\nWill I be able to do my \"consultations\" over email so I can get they surgery as soon as I fly in? Could I send potential doctors photos of my face and will that be enough for them to work on?\n\nWill it be possible to find a doctor who can do all three procedures in one go (so I can heal at the same time for all)?\n\nSince I live in NYC, I want to shop around NYC surgeons for free consultations (do they do that?) to boost my knowledge and then fly to an overseas doctor when I'm ready. \n\nAnd if I have some money left over, I want to look into getting veneers. I heard you can get them for like 5k in Colombia or countries like that. Good or bad idea? \n\nIf anyone can give me any advice at all, I would be very grateful. I only have two months to figure all this out.", "subreddit": "ForeverAlone"}

I'll admit I'm just as guilty of this. I see it being done all around me so I know the only way I'll be able to 'connect' with other humans is to play along with these dumb games. Social conventions, presenting ourselves in certain ways, engaging in small talk... I'm sure you know what I mean.\n\nI sometimes feel like I've constructed this whole entire social 'self' around who it is that other people expect me to be. Or even who they need me to be. And I just keep waiting. Waiting for someone else to show the slightest hint that they, too, are fucking sick of all the pretending. I just want a genuine soul to soul connection that transcends all of this menial day-to-day stuff. \n\nAt this point it just brings me down so much lower whenever I try to put myself out there and spend time with other people.

She's an average looking girl, so think about that when she says she has to physically avoid guys. The conversation has been paraphrased a bit to make it shorter.\n\nMe: Girls aren't into me.\n\nHer: Maybe it's because you don't talk to them? Girls expect the guy to make the move, regardless of whether he's attractive.\n\nMe: The difference between a hot guy and an ugly one is that a hot guy goes up to a girl, he says hi. She says \"hey sweetie\" and leans forward. An ugly one says hi. She says \"I have a boyfriend\".\n\nHer: No girl who has self respect will say \"hi sweetie\" and lean forward. Don't take rejections personally, hot guys get rejected more times than you can count. Most of the times the girl's not in the right headspace.\n\nMe: Once I literally just said \"hi, how are you\" and I got the \"I have a boyfriend\" line in a disco.\n\nHer: Yeah but, girls' intuition. They can tell if a guy wants to get to know them. If a guy approaches you for no reason or compliments you after saying hi, he wants to get to know you. That's why most guys use the \"do you know where the - insert place- is\" line, then try and have a conversation.\n\nMe: Now I see why you hate parties and discos. It sounds like you're avoiding guys all the time.\n\nHer: You learn some tips as a girl: don't wear makeup, wear black, though that's not that helpful, tracksuits and a hoodie and the famous resting bitch face. Don't approach girls like that.\n\nMe: Did you get approached a lot?\n\nHer: Only when I look up from my phone.\n\nMe: Do you realize how crazy that would be for a guy?\n\nHer: I know it is, and it's sad, but most of the times you need to go to places where girls are willing to get into relationships.\n\nMe: I feel like you're contradicting yourself. You just said girls don't wanna be approached but you tell me I should be approaching girls.\n\nHer: No no, approach her. For instance, if she's sitting down on a bench ask her if u can sit down and ask her about her. After u charmed her, ask for the number. If she says no, move on. It's not that hard.\n\nMe: I still feel like that's some dream scenario.\n\nHer: Nahh most girls are not that evil.

You know what happens, the usual responses. Disbelief, shock, even mockery. Most people are unable to understand that there are humans who are not suited for sex.\n\nHowever, I think that the reaction changes completely when it comes to being kiss less. First of all, the age when your are supposed to start making out with people is much sooner than when you\u2019re supposed to lose your V-Card. \n\nSecondly I suppose that it is several times easier than having sex, so you are at least twice the failure as a man if you are unable to get just one kiss.\n\nWhy am I writing this? Because I am terrified of letting people know, and I want to know if it is the same for you guys. You see, I have no problem acknowledging my virginity,  but for some reason it is the complete oposite with admitting that I have never kissed a girl in my life.\n\nI believe this problem \u201ctrauma\u201d of mine started after watching an iCarly episode. I realise it sound really stupid,  but hear me out. In that episode the nerd character that helps with the IT related stuff in the show admits he is KS. By the way, he is just 14 or 15 years old. Welp, he gets bullied to oblivion by his classmates. Then he makes out hit a girl that made fun of him and then the episode ends. Moral of the story? Just kiss you fucking loser, you deserve the mockery. They could have said that it is perfectly alright to be KS at that age, but no.\n\nI just hate the reaction I get. The first time I said that I have never kissed everyone in the room suddenly stopped talking and looked at me, it became awkward as hell. Same thing happened the second and third time. I truly do not understand.

Especially this one girl that I\u2019ve been practically in love with (day/night dreaming about her all the time) that I am a bit more shy around but I think that she thinks of me as a friend. Does anyone know how I could really tell if any of these girls actually \u201clike like\u201d me or just like me as a friend.\n\nBTW I\u2019m writing this post because I had another dream last night about having a girlfriend. She was beautiful. The nicest and happiest person I have ever met and so kind and made my heart so warm. When I woke up however, I was devastated. Cried for about 30 minutes and have been feeling empty and lonely the entire day, not being able to concentrate on anything.", "subreddit": "ForeverAlone"}

Well, it seems like it's going to come true this year. I'd kill for companionship, I'd kill to be loved. I just want somebody to love and accept me for who I am without me having to hide anything.

To make it worse, the self-accusing of selfishness  haunts me every time I lay in bed.\n\nI know it\u2019s greedy, I know it\u2019s not kind.  I wish somebody would prefer me over anyone else, as a friend.  I moved a lot in my childhood, and there is one thing I have learned.  You might think you can get over past friends, but when you fall in that dark pit of loneliness, all you can think about are those lost friendships.  My old friends have all moved away or slowly distances themselves from me.  My only two friends are all I have left.  I tried to make myself stop feeling these horrible feelings of attachment, but I still have fallen head over heels for one of the two friends I have left.  On the rare times I hang out, I can\u2019t control myself from feeling jealousy when my other friends does anything with my crush.  It\u2019s mortifying.  Hell, I\u2019m starting to be confused about my emotions.  I\u2019m uninterested in intimacy at this point.  I just want somebody that would always be at my side, who I could always trust.  My father told me a long time ago that it wasn\u2019t important to have a lot of friends, but to have a few of your closest ones.  I can\u2019t agree more, because Ive seen how true that is.

I just want it to end.\n\nNot end my life though.  It\u2019s strange, I know things will get better, I know things will straighten themselves out.  It\u2019s just this episode has darkened my life.

Truthfully, I should have ended things with my ex years ago. I was absolutely miserable for the last couple of years. But I'd somehow convinced myself it was better to be with somebody and miserable than alone.\n\nOnce I got out though, I felt a happiness and freedom I haven't felt in so long. I'm getting to do all the things I never got to do while I was in that relationship and have started doing things for myself again. And I've not been this happy in literally years. \n\nBut I'm missing having an emotional and intimate connection with somebody. Honestly, I miss the physical connection as well. Like a lot. My libido took a nosedive over those last couple of years and I had zero sexual desire. But now that I'm single again, I feel like I've got the libido a 15 year old boy again. But more than anything, even though I'm not looking to jump straight into a relationship right now, I miss having that intimate, emotional connect that comes with getting to know somebody on a deep level. \n\nI can be a bit of an introvert so meeting new people is sometimes -- okay most of the time -- difficult. I'm not the spot a woman across the bookstore, walk right up, and introduce myself kind of person. But once the ice is broken, things are great. \n\nIt's just meeting somebody who can help me break the ice that's the problem. This is the problem with being me -- well, one of them anyway.

My friend said something the lines of \"well y'all didn't have anything in common anyways so it prolly wouldn't have worked out,\" and I realized then that of all the girls I have ever liked, I have had little to nothing in common with them. The closest was an acquaintance of mine who had similar music tastes and opinions as me, but outside of that I can't think of a single instance of me crushing on someone who has similar interests as me. In the back of my mind whenever I pursued a new girl I always kind of knew that we didn't have anything in common, but I never really thought about the fact that I have NEVER been interested in a girl who had similar interests as me.\n\nSo now it makes me wonder if that's been one of the contributors to my situation, outside of the usual lack of confidence and below-average to average looks. I am an introverted person who has introverted hobbies, yet I always find myself attracted to more extroverted types, or pretty girls who just like vastly different things than me.

I'm never going to be the white knight sticking up for women who can stick up for themselves. \n\nI read an article that said people who believe in monogamous relationships are bigots. I discussed it with my chad coworker who has a very negative view of men in open relationships. I said, I don't care what other people do with their own relationships, but I would need a monogamous relationship. If that makes me an evil, incel, nice guy, then so be it. I don't have to worry about it since I am not financially secure so nobody could use me for that, but if I somehow became financially secure, I could never let myself be in anything but a monogamous relationship.\n\nThis isn't towards anyone but more of a vent.

After all, I didn't felt like I was suffering from having few friends or from spending my weekends on my own at home. I considered myself to be a shy introvert, but a satisfied one. After all, I have a best friend and managed to escape the destiny of becoming a wizard at age 30, lol. \n\nI also thought I was doing fine progress-wise in my life. In 2013 I failed at college and dropped out. I spend the next 1,5 years trying to study something else, but I was just running away from reality and my own feeling of shame and failure. Then I made the brave step to quit, this time because I wanted to. It took me a year to find a job-based education and I'm now close to finishing it after 3 years. In those 3 years, I moved out and started living in my first own apartment. I also have a job offer on hand, so I can keep working at the same place after finishing my education. Its going to be a boring job in accounting, but I was so glad to not having to register as unemployed next month and to not be forced to have my job hunt to be driven by existential fears. Only thing I was looking forward to, was finding a better apartment, as mine is in a very old house and hasn't seen any upgrade in decades.\n\nAnd then I got my heart broken. \n\nA man I had fallen in love with at first sight (literally), confessed that he doesn't think he has romantic feelings for me. And although I had been rejected before in my life and felt some lovesickness, not even the break-up with my boyfriend felt this bad. I never felt so intense for anyone ever (I've been single for 8 years). He was just so...perfect in any way.\n\nNow I know I'm not as resilient, as I thought I was. I'm lonly and afraid. Suddenly it does matter, that my friends and parents don't live close by. And I feel so unwanted, unloveable , I see all my flaws and the fear, that I'll end up all alone for the rest of my life is back. It just hurts. And there is nothing I can fall back on, as everything I considered okay/decent is now void of any joy or pragmatic satisfaction. I hate my apartment, I hate the upcomming job and the city I live in. Even my own hobbies don't give me the satisfaction and joy they once did. There is no \"at least I have X\" argument I could come up with, to ease the negative feelings.\n\nSorry for the long text.

I use the term autist very loosely. (I use it as a term of endearment)\n\nSo I'm (21M) a normie, but a bit of a weirdo. I can relate to maybe 60% of posts here (Not so much the 30+yo people.) and I sometimes struggle with feeling like a social reject even though it's pretty obvious I am not one. I have a lot of very autistic friends with less than average social skills or even ones that have kind of a MGTOW (or worse) mindset. (Some of which I have watched become a lot more socially adept during the time I've known them.) I spent some time on 4chan. I was kissless till 19 and by some definitions, I'm actually still a virgin now.\n\nLooking through the posts on this subreddit for a while, it is pretty clear to me that the immediate problem for most of you guys is your mindset. Because I'm interested in the topic of social rejects and self-help I decided to go through some of your posts and write down some bullet points off the top of my head. The guide is written kind of authoritatively but that's not because I think I'm in the position to be giving commands but just because that style is easy to write in. Because of that it sounds a bit harsh with pretty low persuasive power and lacks charm but oh well. Maybe I'll pretty it up eventually.\n\nWhy should you trust me to give sound advice? Well, I'm not really active on reddit so there is no real way you can judge my social skills by going through my post history. I rank myself as about average in terms of social skills but trying to justify that online would be pretty ineffective. I wrote the guide not because I think I have life figured out, but because it helps me put into words a certain mentality I have subconsciously adopted in the last couple of years that has made me quite happy with myself. I call it a guide, but really I just want to share my ideas.\n\nAs an analogy, if the topic of the text wasn't social skills but interior design it would be a description of how I, an amateur, currently choose to furnish my room, not a guide on whats the right or the wrong way to do so. If you want to study it like a guide, that's fine I guess but just know that it was intended to be more like a coffee table book and that I am agnostic as to whether stuff like this can actually be learned just by reading it.\n\nHoly shit, get to the point. Alright.\n\nIn no particular order\n\n\"Why should I want to become more social?\" Actually you don't, honestly. Unless some of the stuff you want to do depends on other people in which case absolutely you should. And let's be honest, unless you are an extreme exception this applies to you.\n\nRecognize that too much medicine is bad. A tip like \"Care less about what other people think.\" doesn't apply to you if you already care 0%. How can you find out where you are on these spectrums? Only through a lot of social interactions.\n\nStop Self-Pitying. Recognize that even though certain things are really easy for some people, they are a challenge for you personally. Have irrational faith in your current self to deal with your situation. Ask yourself if a hero got teleported into your exact situation what would they do? In fact, the more fucked your situation the greater the opportunity is for an amazing journey. Enjoy the challenge.\n\nDon't regret the past. It is your origin story and it gave you the opportunity to face your current challenge.\n\nDon't set proxy goals. Will everything really get better once you learn Japanese and move to Japan. Will everything really get better if you're ripped? Some things sure, but the solution to your problems aren't that simple.\n\nBe secure in your insecurities. Be comfortable with them. You shouldn't hide your virginity / small dick / whatever. You don't have to go whining about them, but you don't have to pretend you aren't insecure.\n\nStop caring what other people think. If someone makes fun of you, there are only two possibilities. That person is insecure themselves or they really don't actually care about the effects of their actions. If you're so scared of what other people think, go outside and do a Naruto run in a busy street while barking or some shit. Really makes you stop worrying about how you come across. (I'm not saying don't worry about how you come across. I'm saying only analyze your behavior if that's actually what you want to do.)\n\nDon't nourish resentment towards people. Treat people as part of the natural environment. Would you get angry at a river for flowing? A fire for burning down your house? Sure you might be upset but direct your anger at the situation, not the person.\n\nIf you see / meet a stranger you may be tempted to rank yourself in comparison with them. \"I bet she's a stuck up bitch.\", \"Wow, he's even more autistic than me.\", \"Omg I could never be so confident.\" Stop that.\n\nDon't assume normies are happy. You may see them laughing / having fun / whatever but this is normal to them, just as chilling in your room is normal to you. Sure you may actually be more depressed than they are and their lifestyle may be healthier in the long run but resist the temptation to roll your eyes at normie problems.\n\nSometimes when people stop self-pitying and start bettering themselves they become arrogant. \"Pfff, I love normies and how they can't even deal with their comparatively easy problems. Meanwhile, I'm out here slaying dragons. lol\" That's fine for the beginning but drop that as soon as your ego becomes less fragile.\n\nIf you enjoy doing something, even in retrospect, you don't have to change that part of you. Embrace your autism. Be a proud weeb / furry / whatever the fuck. \"But all weebs are social rejects and just mentioning that you like anime will get you weird looks.\" Well, be the exception. Be so out of line with that expectation that people won't believe you when you tell them you watch my little pony.\n\nFor all the people who would be extroverts if they were social: Enjoy spending at least some of the time you are alone. If you don't enjoy your own company who else will? How can you tell if you are an extrovert? Imagine yourself hanging out with some people and you are not the center of attention for the entire interaction. You just occasionally throw out a remark here or there. Are you fine with that? If not you are an extrovert.\n\nFind a healthy balance between exploring what you like doing and doing what you like. If you feel unhappy doing the same things every day, that means you should explore a lot more options. Don't knock it till you try it applies to virtually anything besides maybe stuff that will impact your health significantly. I can't take you seriously if you say you don't like going out and you haven't actually had the maximum amount of fun that is possible for you personally while going out.\n\nDon't make sour grapes excuses like \"I don't really want anything to do with women anyway.\" \"I'm comfortable just watching anime alone on a Friday night.\" You can tell it's a sour grape excuse if you never seriously tried the opposite. Everyone would respect MGTOWs if they fucked like crazy in their teens and then decided it wasn't for them. Imagine how good watching anime alone on a Friday night will feel if you've tried everything else there is to do and know that currently out of all those things you really do prefer just watching that hentai or whatever.\n\nThere's three levels of confidence. There's competence and experience at achieving what you want to do. Then there's how you think of yourself as a person. (The autobiography being formed in your mind.) And most importantly there's the meditative confidence of just finding comfort in the pure experience of the present moment. The latter kind of involves separating yourself (as in the entity that experiences things) from yourself (as in the person defined by the things he does). It is the act of withholding the evaluation of your experiences until you want to (if you want to). Work on all three types of confidence simultaneously.\n\nIf you come across as an asshole, it doesn't mean you have to become more agreeable (although that may apply as well), it means you have to become more charming. Charm comes from practicing the social skills to create and alleviate tension in a social interaction. The PUAs have a good literature on this.\n\nNote: There are two types of assholes. \"Anon is such an asshole. \\*laughs\\*\" (Disagreeable but Charming) \"Anon is such an asshole! \\*angry\\* \" (Disagreeable but not Charming) \"Anon? He's so boring.\" (Way too agreeable.)\n\nOn that note, don't be afraid to be disagreeable. If you have the charm to back it up it makes you interesting. If you subconsciously overvalue other people, however, being disagreeable can cause \"nazi\" behavior that sounds a little something like this: \"No, that's bullshit, you are fucking wrong! &gt;:( \" Calm down there buddy, the other person isn't a major world leader, it's fine if they are wrong on some issues.\n\nDon't go proselytizing your beliefs onto others if they're not interested. Everyone lives in their own bubble, that's fine. Treat a conversation with someone like your invited to their house. You can comment on the furniture or decoration, but if you start trying to rearrange stuff or hang up your own pictures, that's not going to be enjoyable.\n\nNormies don't have magical powers, they just have more reference experiences. \"But, it's too late for me to have these experiences.\" See what I said about self-pity. If you have weird interests, you need even more social skills and thus reference experiences than a normie does in order to do the social things you want to do. Here's the bright side: if you have strange interests and hobbies and you embrace that side of you on your way to becoming chad, once you do gain social skills you will far outpace a boring normie chad. Autism chad is S-Tier.\n\nGet over your ugliness. Especially if you are a man, being handsome is not absolutely necessary. Being attractive to girls is to some degree just a behavior pattern not a look. Girls are weird like that. It's more difficult if your ugly, I acknowledge that, but handsomeness is not even close to the most important factor for male attractiveness. Let's say your ugliness means you need to have 4x the amount of social skills than a normie to be attractive and because of your ugliness the necessary reference experiences are 4x harder to get. That's just 16x more effort than a normie has to put in (and normies hardly put any effort in.)\n\nNote: If you're an ugly girl you have it more difficult. Enjoy playing the game on hard difficulty mode. (For the confused guys: yes it's easier for them to have sex, but it's generally speaking not what they desire exclusively.)\n\nDon't resent people for doing what they like to do. Staceys and Chads will continue to fuck because they like to and it's none of your business. They really aren't taking a slice from your pie.\n\nYou aren't owed affection, a relationship, sex or friends. No one is taking it away from you.\n\nLearn how to have light conversations. If you aren't used to being social, conversations will feel very heavy for you. Every word you say will have meaning behind it. You cannot achieve banter in that state. Learn how to say things that just popped into your head before you even evaluated them. People aren't gonna assume you mean every word if you give off a light vibe. Light conversations will feel completely meaningless until you realize that it's not about what you're saying but about enjoying conversation itself, not any specific topic. Watch some podcasts with stand up comedians to get a feeling for what banter is.\n\nDon't assume that you will always have the same interests or be the same person.\n\nTry to enjoy social situations for what they are in the moment, not for what you hope to get out of them. Enjoy talking to strangers regardless of if you become friends. Enjoy going on dates.\n\nIf your one of those people who actually has approached 100s of people and it hasn't worked out, clearly you need to change your behavior.\n\nFuck fatalism. \"Oh well, I wasn't born a chad. Guess I'll be forever alone. It honestly doesn't even bother me anymore.\" What a boring end to your story.\n\nDon't put a value on things you haven't experienced except for the value of \"I haven't done that, I really should try it.\" Sex is not a big deal. Just because you heard someone talk about how it makes them really happy or because it is in every TV show doesn't mean it has to be the core focus of your attention. Imagine if a normie overheard some autists talking about how great anime is. They might think \"Huh, I might check that out.\" They definitely won't think \"Holy shit I will drop everything and abandon my other hobbies just to watch anime.\" You could develop the same pathology about anything if it was hard for you to achieve. When you actually experience the thing then you can start to give it a lot of value if it was that enjoyable.\n\nIf you don't want to judge a situation, don't. Do you find yourself asking yourself \"Is this normal?\" \"Am I being weird?\" \"Is this a sign she is not into me?\". Those questions probably are useful to ask but only when you want to think them through. Observation without evaluation is what inner confidence is.\n\nFuck waiting to be in the right place at the right time. There is no perfect opportunity and if you haven't been gathering reference experiences and failures you will not even be able to take that opportunity when it comes.\n\nFuck validating sympathy. Why would you want someone to tell you you're doing everything right when you're not.\n\nTake responsibility for your situation, even if you think it's not your fault. Things aren't happening to you. Things are happening and you are responding. This is actually not in conflict with distancing the you that experiences the present moment from the past you. You can think of yourself as the manager of all the past you's. You are responsible for what they did, but you won't be offended personally if someone attacks them or makes fun of them.\n\nSeparate your business from other peoples business. Don't worry about stuff that is not your business and don't blame others for stuff that is your business. She thinks you are ugly? Her business. He is ignoring you? His business. She doesn't want to spend the night? Her business. It might be because they are grumpy because their parrot died. It might be because they have diarrhea. It might be because they don't like you. It might be whatever, but it's not your business. The world doesn't revolve around you. The reverse is also true. You're a virgin? Your business. You get anxiety when people aren't nice to you? Your business. Handle your business. Leave other people alone. Drop the ego. You might think you don't have one because you don't feel confident and aren't you walking around like a macho but you do.\n\nDon't be social for the sake of getting validation. If you have a great experience, the happiness should come from the situation itself, not from the thought of bragging about it afterward.\n\nBe outcome independent. If you like doing something, focus on enjoying the parts that are under your control. Whenever you think \"I like making people laugh.\" also think \"I enjoy telling jokes.\" Whenever you think \"I like winning medals.\" also think \"I enjoy playing competitive chess.\"\n\nDo exactly what you want to do. Not necessarily what you want to be. If you want to be a grand pianist but don't enjoy playing the piano, don't. Sometimes there are edge cases where you don't enjoy the activity but you want to do it regardless because you feel responsible for it or because the outcome is worth it. That's fine if the outcome isn't more than a couple weeks in the future and if it has a reasonable chance of actually occurring.\n\nOnce you start to see progress you are going to get imposter syndrome. You will think that because some people never had to think about acquiring social skills since they were exposed to so much experiences growing up you will never reach their level. This is not the case. A reference experience is a reference experience regardless of when you have it.\n\nRecognize that when otherwise friendly seeming people hurt you by poking at your insecurities this is a sign of progress. They see you as resilient and secure. They wouldn't behave like this if they thought you were fragile.\n\nHere's how to find out if you have an insecurity. Next time you have a negative emotion (sadness / frustration / anger) observe whether or not it comes along with a HNNG / chest tightening / anxiety feeling. Like a falling sensation in your stomach. If so, yep, there's an insecurity somewhere, although it may not be obvious what it is. Try to formulate the emotion as a thought and edit the thought until it feels maximum HNNG. Now ask yourself what about yourself makes you HNNG at that thought. If God could edit you or your past in order to make the HNNG thought go away what things would he delete / insert / edit? Those are your insecurities. Note: the negative emotion may even be justified! But the anxiety is not. Example: If seeing someone do something immoral makes you feel angry, that's fine. If you are so phased by the memory that remembering it and feeling anxious because of it takes up more time than you want it too, that probably points to an insecurity.\n\nFinancial success is not directly attractive for most women (besides maybe some gold diggers but they don't really go for attractive men anyways) it's just that being successful correlates with being attractive. There is even some causation involved I'm sure. (It's hard to be insecure when you're Elon Musk.) Sure go and be successful. It will probably make you more attractive. But it's not actually necessary. Don't use your unemployability / dead-end job as an excuse for why you are single.\n\nDon't worry too much about statistics. Let's say you live in a fictional country where 90% of people are assholes. If you don't live in a small village, that means there are still going to be thousands of people who aren't. Let's say only the 5% most attractive men get matches on tinder statistically. That just applies to a representative sample of the data set. Solution: just don't be a representative sample of the data set.\n\nEdit: just thought of more shit\n\nIt's great if you make a friend with the same interests as you, but a friend with whom you have nothing in common can be just as great. Compatibility is more complex than just common conversation topics. I like to use the straw hat crew from one piece as an example. They all have completely different interests and goals but they are great friends. In fact the more someone is different from you the more valuable they are as a friend.\n\nYour personality is not the problem. What would you say to a morbidly obese person who says: \"I can't stop eating, that's just part of my personality.\" No it isn't, it is a bad habit. Stuff that is actually part of your personality like, for instance, being introverted is not a problem.\n\nHow do you separate your personality from your bad habits? Think to yourself, if this thing that I like doing was socially acceptable and there was no outside pressure to do it or not do it, would the best version of me still do it? If they would then it's part of your (current) personality. If they wouldn't then it's a bad habit.\n\nIf you think of personality as what you want to do in any given situation then by definition in new environments and situations you do not have a personality until you have explored all the different things there are to do in that situation. \"It's just my personality that I like to stand in the corner in social settings and never speak to anyone.\" Sure, maybe, but only if you've actually tried a number of alternatives. Otherwise, how do you know? You might think that you know yourself but you will be surprised by what you enjoy doing once you actually try it.\n\nNote: By trying the alternatives in the above example I don't just mean having a failed, cringey interaction. I mean actually taking the time to work on yourself until you have a proper good interaction. If you then decide that standing in the corner is better then you're just a mysterious introvert kinda dude and that's pretty rad.\n\nPeople do not reject you because of your personality. Respect comes from people realizing through your actions (and through word of mouth by others) that you know exactly what you want to do from experience in any given situation. There is no personality type that corresponds to \"the type of person who doesn't know wtf they want in life and it would be detrimental to them to actually go and find out\" or \"the type of personality that is incapable of doing a certain thing\".\n\nIf you go through this guide and at every sentence you pause and think \"How can I interpret this in a way that makes it completely impractical / not relavant for me?\" that could mean that you are so comfortable in your victimhood and self-pity that you feel attacked just by the thought that there is something you could do to better your situation. You may have actually set up being a victim as a pillar of your self-confidence and you are scared that there will be nothing left when even that gets taken away from you. You are behaving just like that guy from Little Brittain who keeps saying he is the only gay in the village.", "subreddit": "ForeverAlone"}

Was it always like this?\n----\nI want to preface the following thoughts with a couple things. One, I am not playing the blame game here. I recognized and understand the effect of looks, status, and money have on attraction and desirability. I am not implying that you or me are completely to blame for our isolation. Two, I recognize that being someone who typically does not fit in or has undergone some abuse, can have profound effects on personality, general temperament, approchability, social skills, etc. I am not implying that you are the only designer of who you are. We are all a product of our genetics, experiences, and upbringing. Lastly, despite what you may take from these ramblings, I do believe self love is important and not just a normie quote. It really does help to TRY not to regard yourself with complete disgust. We may feel broken here on this sub but that does not mean we are unworthy of love, care, and general common decency. Don't shit on yourself. The world can handle that job.\n\nI was thinking today about my mental illnesses, personality, beliefs, and outlook, and how it might have a hand in pushing me deeper into isolation, and farther away from others. When I was younger, I was bubbly and talkative. So much in fact, that on numerous occasions my parents received letters from school reprimanding me for laughing through lectures. At some point, I estimate during middle school and high school, something changed. I have ruminated over this period the way an insurance agent might over an accident. What went wrong? Whose fault is this? Of course it's different from an agent, because while their investigation will yield some vital conclusion, spuring payouts and more inquiries, my introspection is really just self torture. Regardless, I do it anyway. I concluded that is was the beginning of high school, and more specifically, my coming of age and realizing that I was weird. I dont remember calling that at the time, but the idea was definitely present. I was not like the other boys. I'd never had a girlfriend, didn't smoke or drink, didn't really feel comfortable with any clique or group, and had ideas often seen as 'too heavy' for regular conversation. This characterization is not meant to be a compliment by the way. If anything it's my deviance that in part, contributed to me finding difficulty forming connections with those my age and I still struggle doing so. Anyway, at this point I am 16 years old, khhv, and surrounded by people who have done all those things multiple times. I cannot relate to them for obvious reasons. This gets compounded by the fact that I was becoming more and more of an introvert. You might argue my growing introversion was due to my insecurities surrounding sex and relationships, and you may very well be right. Things would only get worse from there. I have this theory that social isolation is like a stain. The longer it gets to set in, the more damage it does, to the point where its effects are very hard to reverse. My senior year I was a certified loner. It didn't hurt because it wasn't a wound. It was who I was and is who I am. I had some close calls. People I called acquaintances, almost friends. But in the end, in my phone contact there are only three people I talk to on a regular basis, and they are immediate family. So there you go. I am 25 years old now and that's my account of things. What about you guys? \n\nPlease excuse typos and strange autocorrects. Did this on mobile. Had to get the thoughts out. Will edit later.", "subreddit": "ForeverAlone"}

Besides all the changes and drama, there was something about my experience I have just remembered that confirms my distrust in establishments.\n\nWhen I was in Middle school, all of the students essentially went to two different schools. Each half of the students were assigned to a different 'house' where there was no overlap of students and teachers from the other house.\n\nLooking back on that memory with a bit more knowlege of the people I went to school with, it seems as though the student body was divided by socieoeconomics and social preference. My house featured a disproportionate number of students from low income families, while the other house seemed to be for the creme of the crop.\n\nThis left me exposed to more people who glorified drugs, violence, bad behaviour and disruptive classmates. It contributed to my pessimism about life, and did not provide a proper balance of people on the right track and people on the wrong track. It made the wrong track more appealing, because that was what was popular among my classmates.\n\nOn the other hand, the more privileged class had more experienced teachers, beloved to this day, while the ones I had were incompetent, first year teachers, talked about drinking with students, and at least a couple were fired while I was there. It was an all around shitshow on my side of the school.\n\nI come from a mid-sized city with a very strong 'community'. Several big name families and influential people who's children were my classmates. Well, not classmates, because it seems the system was designed to quarantine them from the riff-raff.\n\nWe all know that high school and college are corrupt, but it seems to have started in middle school for me. This plays a role in my FA status, as my distrust of other people, particularly groups of people, greatly restricts my ability to make friends. Friendship itself is corruption as far as I'm concerned, I feel dirty trying to make friends.

I am optimistic but my life is extremely difficult. TLDR at bottom\n\n\nAt the start of the year, I was with my friends in a car watching a STP video. I don't like to make physical contact with people and I was avoiding it with the person who was sitting adjacent to me previous to this. I twitched from exhaustion and he copied me. I twitched again and he copied again. I then sat next to him in an ashamed and anxious state for the next thirty minutes where we were in a silent dance of tormentor and tormented. This gave a mild but increasingly worse case of PTSD. All of this happened after smoking quite a lot which contributed greatly to the damage.\n\n\n(I've gotten help and started meds 3 months ago. However, my largest problem is inconsistent peer interaction)\n\n\n\nI started school a bit later. I blocked all of the people who that individual was associated with, which happened to be all of my friends lol. I would always be aware of when I was in the line of sight of everybody and be afraid to jerk and that anxiety wore me down to the point where I would twitch. My depression was horrible and I was a big ball of anxiety. I had a very hard time retaining new information because of my depression. I would always dread going to sit down in the next class and focusing on not bringing attention to myself. I ended up dropping all of my classes except for yoga. Yoga is an amazing tool for people who have PTSD, and I recommend it to anyone who experiences a lot of anxiety \n\n\nEventually I got a lot better. School provided a structure to the chaotic underworld, despite it feeling like hell. I did something that regressed me so far back that I'm still recovering. Yada yada, a lot of debilitating cringe happened, and I mean intense cringe, end of the semester.\n\n\nI unblocked those friends and tried to get into the groove of things by trying to get back into a group chat. After my attempt most of them stopped interacting with me. I assumed they were debating to let me in. One of them decided to act emotionally and that didn't mix well with instability. Another one told me exactly what was happening in a sentence and my assumption was correct. This a big tangent but I have a reason why I started this.\n\n\nI am a huge narcissist. I am evil. I very losely cared about any of them. I used he who shall remain namelesss for weed and I was an avid smoker. I see my role in why my ex-friend couldn't help himself to torment me, which I don't feel particularly inspired to explain.\n\n\nSo there's context of what my year has been like. Some things I missed: I am very irritable, I've been on an upward trend of self-improvement and I got some momentum going (although emotional and pyschological stability is missing), I did LSD and MDMA a few days ago, I don't do drugs regularly. It was challenging to feel exactly as I was in the worst periods of my life. I also have a headache, I think from the LSD, which put me over the edge to make this post.\n\n\nTLDR: My insecurities and constant anxious state makes it impossible to enjoy myself with anybody. I'm afraid that when I get in an intimate relationship I will very self conscious and ruin the moment. The single person who hangs out with me is out of town and thank God we we're still friends. If we hangout I enjoy myself for a while but I'm experiencing constant anxiety so if it's longer than an hour I feel extremely shitty. This also happens when I listen to podcasts and they're negative emotions.\n\n\nI'm going through a government program for job training soon. I'm going to be volunteering at a pawn shop where a mentor will give me tips. It'll be nice. Sorry for the post being long winded, \u270c\ufe0f.", "subreddit": "lonely"}
{"post_id": "cjqqbd", "created_utc": 1564487947, "title": "I don\u2019t have friends, but it\u2019s by choice... I think.", "author": "NatDru", "self_text": "I\u2019d like to know if it\u2019s a bad thing that I discard people when I don\u2019t like an aspect of their personality? I know some people stay friends with others that aren\u2019t that nice just to have friends and people to hang out with. But, I can\u2019t seem to do this. \n\nI\u2019m a 31yr old female living in Los Angeles, this is where I\u2019ve lived my whole life. I\u2018m a pretty likable person, I think. Although I am more of an introvert, I know the importance of making small talk, asking questions, being charming, not awkward and all of that. Therefore, when I meet other girls at events or gatherings I seem to be liked, more than once they have asked me for my number to grab lunch or coffee in the future and just hang out. \n\nMy issue though is that I can read people extremely well. So, right off the bat I know if someone truly can be a potential friend or not. So that excludes a bunch of people as soon as I meet them. And, let\u2019s say I do like a girl and would like to be friends with her, the moment I notice something off in her personality I step away. Think Maya Angelou and her famous quote, \u201cWhen someone shows you who they are, believe them the first time.\u201d I\u2019m actually more forgiving than Miss Angelou and give everyone the benefit of a doubt, a second chance if you will. I figure sometimes people are having a bad day or they expressed themselves incorrectly without realizing it. But, after a while I realize they\u2019re not very nice or centered people so I discard them. I don\u2019t want friends like that, I like nice, kind people and I feel I shouldn\u2019t have to put up with crap like that. And so my question is, Is that a bad thing? Because I genuinely would like to have friends, I just can\u2019t seem to find people I\u2019d like to be friends with. Is it that I\u2019m just too judgmental? I don\u2019t know...\n\nI\u2019ll give you a few examples - \n\n1. I met a lady who was about 15 years older than me, a professor, she was really fun and energetic. Yet, she tended to be rude to people. I noticed it once and let it pass since I figured that\u2019s how her and her friend got along. But, then we went to a karaoke party and she was so rude to multiple people on the same night and towards people she didn\u2019t even know well. So, I thought, this is how she will eventually want to treat me at some point. No thanks. She was also a lesbian and although she assured me that she\u2019d never hit on me since we were friends she did try a few times. She\u2019d get just a little too close for comfort at times and that was very distressing for me. I\u2019m a straight woman and have zero desire to be with another woman, ever. \n\n2. I met another girl whose very well spoken, truly eloquent, and I liked that because I feel I need to be more that way. She was around my age, fun to hang out with. A wannabe actress, but I figured I wouldn\u2019t judge her for it. We do live in LA. Yet, she made multiple comments about how she wants to meet a rich man to marry so that she never has to work again in her life, she doesn\u2019t want to have kids or deal with pets and just wants to be taken care of. I went to her apartment once and she had a bunch of vision boards all throughout her apartment, like a good 30. Now, I\u2019m not saying we can\u2019t have dreams and aspirations, but some of her comments sounded down right delusional. I also know beauty isn\u2019t everything, but she\u2019s like a solid 4, and saying things like that just sounded stupid to me. It was very off putting. \n\n3. Then I had another friend and she was unemployed although she\u2019d tell everyone we met that she was in PR and dealt with clients. At first I didn\u2019t know she was unemployed, but I caught on as we hung out more and she opened up to me about the interviews she was going to. She had\u2014had a 7 month relationship with a guy who ended things with her since he didn\u2019t want anything more than a girlfriend and didn\u2019t want to waste her time since he knew she would eventually want to get married and he just didn\u2019t see that in his future plans. So, anyway, here her and I were talking about this ex boyfriend still after a year and a half after he dumped her. She\u2019d been mourning the breakup longer than what they were even together, which technically was only 4 months since the first 3 they were just friends. Any who, she\u2019d also throw little tantrums here and there sometimes and it was very uncomfortable for me since I don\u2019t like causing scenes in public. \n\nIf you\u2019ve gotten to this point of my post I want to thank you for reading it all the way through. I honestly just want to know if I\u2019m being too picky with the friends I choose and if that\u2019s a good thing or a bad thing? I don\u2019t mind my company, I like doing things alone all the time. But, it would be nice to have a friend I could go have a drink with sometimes or a girls dinner date. I haven\u2019t had a boyfriend in two years so I\u2019d like to go to a bar every once in a while with a friend and see if we can meet guys. I obviously can\u2019t do this by myself, so if you guys have any advice for me I\u2019d greatly appreciate it. \n\nThank you in advance :)", "subreddit": "lonely"}

I asked her if she is not willing to continue my therapy could she at least take them off because I\u2019m statistics with my results. She responded that she will not take them off unless I book a surgery appointment. So I stormed out of her cabinet and didn\u2019t even look at her.

All my life I've ever only had one friend, H, who was forced to be my friend in kindergarten by her cousin. Her cousin saw that I was the only kid with no friends and she was friends with everyone in the class. At the time, I thought she wanted to be my friend and I was happy to finally meet someone. I have always been a super shy and awkward person my whole life and have been made fun of for it. My family tells me constantly that its abnormal for a girl like me to not have friends when my siblings have many. I grew up with H and only talked to her since she was the one who made friends for us. We separated in 3rd grade and I went back to being a loner. Every girl in my classes would often make fun of me for not being like them and I never cared until I got older and understood why they never liked me. H and I reunited again in middle school and everything went back to how it was. She made lots of friends during our time apart and I forced myself into her group. We later separated again in high school and I was back to how I always was. \n\nIn high school, I joined the choir to make friends with people who were interested in the things I was, singing. At first, it was all good, I had lots of friends and none of them knew my past loneliness. I thought being alone was a thing of the past, I was wrong. I started being more confident and happy with the people around me. They began to think I was annoyingly too happy and slowly stopped inviting me to events while I watched their stories on instagram and snapchat. When H would contact me during high school to hang out, I would be excited to see her as I didn't get to see her often. It was always just the two of us until she got a boyfriend. Our time together started to shorten so I decided I needed a boyfriend as well to fill up my emptiness. My first boyfriend was a close friend of mine in high school and things were great until he started asking me for sexual favors in our sophomore year. I would always try to decline as polite as possible as I didn't want to ruin my first relationship. He pressured me more daily and eventually I gave into the pressure and was too scared to tell anyone what he would force me to do. Eventually, after telling H about my problems, she gave me the courage to stand up for myself and stop seeing him since he was very manipulative and didn't care about my well being. He started to harass me during school and luckily I had another friend in my high school who would defend me against him when I couldn't. I looked up to her as an older sister and we hung out when H was too busy with her boyfriend. \n\nI met my sister figure, F, in my Freshman year English class when she transferred from out of state. We instantly clicked and I wasn't sad that my choir \"friends\" wouldn't talk to me. We spent every day together and she took care of me so I wouldn't be hurt again by another guy. F hated the way my first boyfriend treated me and never wanted it to happen again. She protected me when H wasn't there for me. Later on, in senior year, we made friends with lots of people who transferred from out of state and we became best friends. F started dating one of the guys and I felt genuine happiness for her. It wasn't until he was only using her to be close to me and when F found out, she dumped me too along with our other friends calling me a homewrecker. Her ex was quickly forgiven and brought back into the group but I was forever shunned from everyone because I had been seen as an attention seeker. H was also disappointed in me and took F's side and I was left alone the rest of my senior year. I was about to buy grad nite tickets to Disneyland with my friends before the events all played out. When my old choir friends heard out the news they took me back in as if nothing happened before. I slowly recovered from it and started to be happy again when my ex started talking trash to my choir friends and they believed his lies. They pretended to invite me places but never tell me the time and date. I would later see everyone hanging out without me. On our choir instagram page, I was left out of every major photo. They talked about family and how everyone belongs but would always exclude me in everything. \n\nF also started hanging out with my ex and created an instagram account to trash talk me to everyone they knew. F knew a lot of people in our high school and was fairly popular. I was very introverted and only knew choir people and my old friends. Rumors spread fast that I was a thot who would have sex for test answers and homework. I didn't find out about it until a choir friend asked me about my services. I tried to kill myself that night and my family didn't understand why I didn't want to go back to school. I pretended to be happy for the rest of my time there since it was only a few more months until college. I managed to graduate without killing myself and started going to my community college. I went into a Filipino community where I thought I could start fresh with people who would want to learn the culture with me. F moved back to her country and H pretended nothing bad happened in high school. My old friends tried to reach me since F left saying she threatened to stop talking to them if they were still friends with me. Being the naive pushover I was, I accepted their apology and became friends with them again. F's ex went to a university so I wouldn't be able to see him. My ex went to the same community college as me but we haven't seen each other yet. H went to a better university away from her boyfriend making her have more time to message me. Our hangouts when she came home started having more people and eventually, everyone ignored me. \n\nDuring H's birthday party, all her friends insisted on watching a horror movie even though H knew fully well I don't enjoy horror movies. That night I cried and everyone there made fun of me saying I shouldn't be scared because I'm not a baby anymore. One of H's friends was in my class and he would constantly make fun of me to her and she wouldn't tell him to stop. He told her multiple hurtful things about me as she laughed. I later found out he wanted to be with her badly and even told H's boyfriend if he could steal her away. H was very offended by this but he's still more of a best friend than I am. H and I are in summer classes at the moment and I recently found out she still talks to my ex. She used to tell me when I would ask for advice that he was a bad person. Now, he hangs out with her boyfriend and talks to her as if she's his best friend. \n\nI recently tried to kill myself again because of how much everyone around me is hurting me and its not like anyone would notice. I had been telling my parents constantly to put me in another high school because of everything that happened to me but they always refused because my siblings went there and had lots of good friends there. I was sent to a mental facility and my parents didn't care if I killed myself or not. Till this day, all of my choir friends and H are fake friends pretending our bond has been special and they've never had a friend like me. My parents forget about what happens to me also, saying that depression and anxiety don't exist. \n\nI don't know if anyone will bother to read everything and get to the end, but if you do, thank you. I really wish I had a real friend and I often dream about having good memories with them. Going to disneyland and prom are still two things I wish I could experience in my life. Anyways, I left out a lot of detail since its too painful to read but if anyone is interested in making a friend, I'm always available :)", "subreddit": "lonely"}

{"post_id": "ck3axu", "created_utc": 1564546674, "title": "Relative deprivation", "author": "throwaway59232", "self_text": "It's a term I first came across at 19-20 years old in my sophomore Psych class. \n\nBasically, it refers to feelings of depression, anger, or frustration on the part of an individual stemming from a failure to gain equal or similar access to resources compared to others whom they consider to be part of their group. When an individual feels that they have been denied what other members of the group have earned without an acceptable or fixable cause for the discrepancy, feelings of inadequacy, depression, and bitterness often result.\n\nNormies often fail to understand that this is exactly what happens to us. Two of the most common responses they come up with when we discuss our FA problems are \"You aren't entitled to anything\" or \"Just be happy that you aren't impoverished in Africa/ living in a wartorn country/ sick with cancer, etc.\"\n\nIn many cases, such statements simply reflect attitudes of passive aggression, superiority, or condescension, but on occasion they do actually represent genuine and well-intentioned efforts to give us honest, if useless advice. In either case, however, they miss the point.\n\nThe majority of us on this sub are young men, and a few women, in their 20s and 30s, with some even older than that, who have never experienced a meaningful romantic relationship--in fact, most of us have never had sex at all. In North America and Europe, that is a highly unusual situation to be in, especially if it is not because of one's choice or lack of trying. Sure, some of us (again, not all) have supportive families, alright-paying jobs, and decent friend groups, but that does not change the fact that when it comes to our efforts at finding love, we have been utter failures, and the fact that most people consider love to be the most significant aspect of their lives only exacerbates this. \n\nAgain, returning to the Africa/cancer example, some people definitely suffer horribly in other parts of the world, but that is not the case for most of us who grew up in at least moderately wealthy countries where destitute poverty is not really an issue. Conversely, some people at home also suffer from incurable and fatal diseases, but at our ages this is rare, so we don't include them in our comparison group.\n\nThe people we do include are regular, Western millennials, who have done the same things we do, gone to the same colleges, had similar friends, worked similar jobs, and tried equally hard, or in some cases less hard, for relationships yet they have been successful multiple times, and take their relationships for granted, while many of us can't even take the first step. Furthermore, we have already tried all we could and still failed. And in most cases, there is no justifiable reason for why other people have done better than us. In many cases, they were more sociable or better-looking, but looks are mainly the product of genes, while traits like extraversion are partly inherited as well and can be further impaired by negative experiences in childhood and adolescence which most of us have no control over. With that in mind is it any wonder we are depressed and sad?\n\nAnd as for the entitled part, we do not feel entitled to any particular person, but having put in the hard work and the effort, all we want is for there to be one person, out of the hundreds of people we swipe right on, the dozens of people we try to chat up in the bar, the many opposite gender acquaintances and co-workers we have, who would be willing to give us a chance. We do not feel entitled, but rather just want our own piece of the pie which we have worked hard for, yet been denied.\n\nSo, with that in mind, it's hardly surprising that many of us are morose and depressed, and there's even a psychological term that describes our situation. Knowing that the problem has a name and can be explained by regular human psychology will not solve it, but at least it can make us feel less abnormal and make our suffering a little bit easier.", "subreddit": "ForeverAlone"}

People don't understand how important sex is to most people. Sure, some people are introverted or asexual and the lack of companionship hurts me more compared to the lack of sex but not being sexually active in those years when you want to can affect you mentally in a major way. \n\nI remember being in college and hearing people talk about having sex like it was an every day thing. If I said how I wish I could have sex, people would say don't worry about it or it's not a big deal. Once you get past 18 and are still a virgin it's considered to be a red flag but usually not a deal breaker. At 21 it's a bigger deal but still mostly not a deal breaker. In your mid 20's is when more people begin to see being a virgin as a deal breaker. Still, in that 18-21 year old age range, you find out whether you are just a late bloomer or will possibly become FA. \n\nNow I can't even look at a woman thinking in a sexual way because I'm not allowed. I'm a weirdo and creep already so thinking of women in a sexual way would make me even more of that combination. Maybe if I was able to stop being an ugly, autistic, weird, guy in my late teens or early 20's long enough to have sex, maybe I could have used the success to give me the foundation to build my self-esteem on after my childhood of being bullies almost every day especially in high school. Don't let people try to tell you sex isn't a big deal if you are in that age and want to have sex. I'm not saying if you get past 21 as a virgin, you will become FA. You can escape later in your 20's but it becomes much harder. I regret believing what people told me when I was in that age range about sex not being a big deal. Those people got me to be naive about my virginity. I hope none of you especially in that 18-21 or into your mid 20's end up a 36 year old bitter virgin. Do what you can now.

While I was surrounded by family, I felt so ostracized. When I was a baby, I got a fever and had to have a trach put in me. I felt like a caged monster that had to be checked up on by the hour. Felt so hopeless and envied other children\u2019s freedom. I felt like a burden with no one who could understand my pain. The only thing my mother could console me with was prayers of a better afterlife, which now I know I could never experience. Kids were so scared of me that most of them didn\u2019t want to look at me. I only had a handful of friends due to me trying my best to be friendly to distract from my disability. That became a running theme for the rest of my life. When I realized I liked boys, my life shifted. I knew it was wrong and my family told me I would go to Hell if I was like those sinful people. I hated myself ever since. I repressed my sexuality all throughout school. People always asked my friends behind my back If I was gay. I always got asked and laughed it off. It felt like a gut punch knowing how nasty you are and how everyone knows it. I felt like I was a joke and I had no one to turn to. I was trapped in my own mind. I knew I was going to Hell for what I am so I just gave up on giving a fuck. I am not religious anymore for logic reasons but I still fear I am wrong and will pay for what I am at the end. I despise my sexuality yet I long for the day a guy could be interested in me. I know it\u2019s wrong but I\u2019ve never been with anyone in my life. I\u2019ve never had someone like me. Never been to prom or had any fun teen experience. I feel so inferior compared to my older brother who is everything my parents wanted me to be. He is the perfect christian man who has always been loved and admired his whole life. He had a revolving door of girlfriends and a famous football record. He is happy with a wife and kid now. My family probably knows I\u2019m gay and that\u2019s what makes it even worse. They know I\u2019m disgusting and just keep it to themselves. I am an embarrassment to them. Sometimes I wonder if my life was just joke to begin with. If God is real, then why would you put me on this earth to suffer? My days of believing are far over. I just need someone some days. Just to have someone to turn to when I wake up. I have no one but a distant friend who I meet up from time to time. He\u2019s been a longtime friend since elementary. He could never truly understand my twisted relationship with my sexuality or my family problems, though. He has so much shit he has to deal with. He was ok about my sexuality but I feel I caused a rift and know feel talking to him. I hope he doesn\u2019t think I\u2019m creepy or that I want him. Aside from him, I have absolutely no one.

{"post_id": "ckczme", "created_utc": 1564600510, "title": "On Confidence", "author": "Atschuuu", "self_text": "(This ended up being a lot longer than I anticipated. In retrospect, I should have thought of a structure before writing the actual thing. English isn't my first language and I haven't written anything this long in a year, but I hope this gets my thoughts across somewhat effectively.)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBeing one of the most brought up, dreaded, and memed talking points, the topic doesn't really need an introduction. Today, for no particular reason, I'd like to dump some of my thoughts on the matter, explain what I think well-meaning non-FAs typically get wrong and invite everyone to have a bit of a discussion or challenge my points.  \nFirst things first, I will be making a clear distinction between confidence and self-esteem, although some points may apply to both. It seems that many misunderstandings stem from not making this distinction. By confidence, I mean \"the quality of being certain of your abilities\" as per the Cambridge dictionary and for the most part, it will refer to confidence within a romantic context.\n\n  \nMy first point is that confidence is not a universal trait that a person has, but rather very situational. E.g. I can solve certain classes of maths/physics problems and with confidence assert the correctness of my solutions. I can not however confidently draw or paint, because I know from experience that the results will be rather shit. The only way to change this would be through extended practice, more about that later.\n\n  \nNow, there is a lot that goes into achieving physical intimacy with another person especially as a straight guy given current social norms (ignoring the debate whether it's cultural or natural since it doesn't matter here). You have to make the first contact, move the relationship forward towards emotional intimacy, then physical intimacy. While doing this, you have to communicate some level of interest, without seeming too keen so as to maintain romantic tension. Moreover, you have to notice and correctly interpret the other person's reactions and adjust the pace at which you're moving among other things accordingly and of course, make a call as to whether the feelings are mutual in the first place. And this is just the abstract stuff, ignoring the details of what you **actually** do. In addition, you have to be able to do all this with confidence, because if you keep second-guessing everything you say, you're going to seem \"off\", because your body language will betray you and if you take too long thinking about what this or that meant, they might lose interest. This is where I see the misunderstanding arising: most non-FAs have been through this process so often that it has become second nature to them and the only thing they have to worry about is doing what they do with confidence. FAs have a completely different starting point; we lack the absolute basics that non-FAs are hardly even aware of anymore. Telling an FA to act confident means, using the above definition, telling them to feign trust in skills they don't possess. This is completely backwards and an unrealistic expectation.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTake table tennis as an analogy. The most central stroke in the game is the forehand loop and being able to execute a big forehand in a tough situation is an important skill to master. This certainly takes confidence, because it presents a risk. However obviously, handing a new player a racket and telling them to just confidently do it, isn't going achieve anything. No amount of faking it is going to allow them to pull it off in a high-stakes match and they aren't going to be confident, both because they have no idea what they're doing. What actually happens is that new players learn the movements first, then execute it in training with their partners making it intentionally easy for them, before moving on to more realistic scenarios and at last doing it in a match. Note that each of these steps takes confidence, but this confidence does not appear out of thin air; it is gained through succeeding at the previous step. This works only because you are gradually moving from low-difficulty, low-stakes situations to high-difficulty, high-stakes ones. This progression is essential; confidence without competence will lead to the player smashing the ball into the net again and again, just like it would lead an FA person to make a fool of themselves repeatedly and end up socially ostracised.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis is where I see the problem when it comes to dating and FA people: this \"training phase\" for love and romance is constrained rather tightly to a fixed period of your life. Teenagers learn romantic interactions through playful, flirty interactions. This is low-risk because at that stage in your life everything is forgotten within weeks and serious consequences for small mishaps are unlikely and low-difficulty because everyone else doesn't know what they're doing either. Most people remember this as \"cringy\" and that's the whole point. Next come first dates, first kisses and first relationships. Slightly higher risk and difficulty, but it's not too different from what they've done before. Only having been through this do most people enter the world of adult dating. They have a feel for the basics and that is where confidence comes into play. FAs typically don't have this foundation. For a variety of reasons, like looks, mental illness, disability, family difficulties or bullying, they spent their youths on the sidelines, while others were playing truth or dare, writing flirty letters in class, and later making out at parties. Of course, they're going to lack the confidence that these others possess later in life, but you're only scratching the surface with that. Many people on this sub have never experienced someone showing interest in them until quite late in life, so when it happens (if it ever does), how are they supposed to confidently recognise the signs and act accordingly? They have had no chance of a normal development that allowed them to do that. They are thrown into a high-risk (you're more intimidating as an unattractive adult male and making women uncomfortable by misreading signs or acting \"off\" can have severe social consequences at least) and high-difficulty (women expect you to have some experience and hence be smooth, create a \"spark\" etc.) situation they are not prepared for. How could one expect them to act with any confidence? The trouble is that one can not simply go back in time to catch up on the natural progression of these things. I see no real solution to this. At any rate, confidence related advice needs acknowledge that confidence is progressively built (usually alongside a skill related to it), rather than expecting it to come out of nowhere, and provide actionable steps. If it doesn't it's unlikely to be of any use. \n\n(Caveat: this is only really applicable to FAs who have overcome whatever held them back in their youth. If you still have poor looks etc., your lack of experience and confidence won't even matter)\n\nThis is also how I'd draw the line between an FA and a late bloomer; a late bloomer has learned the basic skills through these experiences and just hasn't utilised them yet, while an FA lacks them mostly or entirely.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nConclusion/TL;DR: While confidence is important in dating and other kinds of success, it is the last step after a long progression of learning skills and experiencing a series of small successes and does not happen in a vacuum. Addressing confidence as the main issue ignores this and skips too many steps to lead to any useful advice.", "subreddit": "ForeverAlone"}

Everyday I forget your face, your voice, everything that I loved about you. I once again see the facade that your personality betrays. Everyday that you aren't here, I feel as alone as if you were. I used to think that you were the one. The One. The one to end the cycle that I unknowingly began when I was younger and pressured into finding someone to spend my life with. The one to show me how to be a better person. The one to force me to work harder. I tried so hard to be perfect for you. To be the one to bring you the happiness that I felt you deserved. How selfish and complacent of me to believe that I would be the one for you. I was a stupid boy who has yet to get over it. I idolized you. You may not know it, but it hurt so much when you told me that you saw me as a brother and you weren't looking for a relationship. Then turned around a week or so later and went out on your first date with a friend of mine and forged a relationship. It didn't last and he betrayed you, just like the next guy, but I always kept faithful, waiting for the right moment. I can't forget the time that you invited me to the community band and I was able to go, I was so happy. I went, we had a great time and I was biding confidence to ask you out. Then, as I was sitting in my room and watching a movie, I saw it. The Instagram post to ruin my absolutely wonderful day. For the first time in several years, I cried, and it wouldn't stop for a long tome. Why would I write this so long after it was already over? After you already made the transition from one school to the rival. I get it, you were pressured, you felt pressured. The teachers, the students, they didn't make life any easier for you. So you quit, you left everything behind. I knew it would happen, with how intelligent and beautiful you are, but you left me behind. You cut almost every connection you had to the school and I was what you had to remind you of the place you cried about everyday. It almost isn't fair. I know I was odd, I was borderline creepy most of the time and my thought process was so poisonous. I feel like I should apologize every time I see or speak to you. I couldn't comfort you when I had to, I couldn't stand up and be confident. I could relate you and I was always a \"mood.\" But I couldn't be toxic in my dealings like you could, I couldn't be \"fake\" to people like you could. \n\nIt isn't hard at all\n\nTo recall\n\nMemories of you", "subreddit": "lonely"}

Like today, I was taking with this nice girl for about a week and she wanted to go on a date to dunkin, so we decided to do that and here I am waiting for her for the last hour being stood up while yesterday she was totally fine about going. Either way this has always been happening to me and I cant figure out why, I am not that bad looking, I groom well I\u2019d say and I dress well, but still girls dont see me as a potential candidate and I always seem to get ditched as they probably think of me as nothing more than a joke", "subreddit": "ForeverAlone"}
