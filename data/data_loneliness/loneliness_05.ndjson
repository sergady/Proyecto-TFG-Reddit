{"post_id": "bjdlcb", "created_utc": 1556688599, "title": "What it's like to have no friends and be FA(long rant)", "author": "Anotherguy783", "self_text": "I've seen outsiders talk about how they don't know how someone can have no friends. It's nothing against them since with most people they either have friends from their social circle that started in middle to high school or college, and sometimes people are able to make friends by going out. I'm not one of those people. \n\nIt's easy to have no friends. It's just not common. Society is more closed to talking to people in public than it used to be. People can still make friends but it's more difficult. If you are socially awkward, it becomes much harder than it is for the normal person and it's difficult for normal people to approach people in public to make new friends. \n\nWhen you are FA with no friends, most of the time you tried. Unless you are very introverted, friendless FA'ers have tried to make new friends. The combination of being average to below average looking combined with social awkwardness causes us to weird people out. Nobody wants to be friends with that unattractive weird guy. I don't blame them. Those people already have social circles. Some people some men and some women have called me weird when I used to go out to meet people. \n\nOnce you get into your mid 30's, since you are FA, you realize most likely you are never going to escape FA. The only sex you will ever have will be by paying for it. It is part of what causes you to also make it so you don't have the energy to go out anymore. You are constantly depressed. Sometimes you browse Facebook profiles of either women you were interested in and see that they are now either married or in a long term relationship. You see the smile on their face in their pictures with their significant other. She never looked at you that way. Since you have no friends to distract you, sometimes you spend hours looking at people you wish you could have gotten close to. You also look at profiles of men and women who you have interacted with over the years. Some of them were friends 10 years ago when you had friends. I had a 5 year span when I had friends in my 20's. They all ghosted on me. You look at these people who have settled down with other people and see how happy they are. You realized you never was able to mature like they did. They outgrew you. You were just a phase to them. You see the profiles of two people who have been best friends for years and you were the one who introduced them to each other. That happened to me. They became best friends and both ghosted on me. \n\nIt's Friday Night and you are too old to be going to clubs and have given up trying to make friends. You realized how much money you wasted trying to make friends. You also wanted to meet a woman but you know people will call you entitled if you say that. You stay home playing video games to try and distract you from your reality of being FA with no friends. \n\nPeople try to tell you that you need to go out again and join hobby groups because that worked for them or they know someone that worked for. You already tried that and it didn't work but they tell you it's because you did something wrong. They tell you that you should never give up. They don't understand how failing hundreds of times has caused you to give up since a person can only take so much failure without success before giving up. \n\nAt work you see coworkers become friends. You know they aren't interested in being friends with you. They finish work and go out together while you finish work then go home. People will tell you to ask them to join but you know that would make them uncomfortable and if they wanted me to join them, they would have asked. \n\nIt's 1am and you are depressed. You think about bad things to escape your isolated reality. There is no solution that ends with you escaping FA. There is no solution that ends up with you making friends. You can only vent on here because if you vent anywhere else, you get platitudes or called entitled. Some boards will even ban you. People don't understand the experienced of a FA'er with no friends. The only people who do are posters on here who are in similar positions. \n\nYou take your anxiety and sleep meds. You slowly drift off to sleep to one of those girlfriend role play videos on Youtube. \n\nYou wake up the next morning and see that you are off. You have the day free to go out but you don't Maybe you walk to somewhere to get lunch before walking home. You are defeated as a person. Life has destroyed you.\n\nTl;dr, Being FA with no friends is extremely depressing.", "subreddit": "ForeverAlone"}

I met him in 7th grade during a play rehearsal. I don\u2019t remember how we even started talking, but from that day on I would wait with him at the front of the school. We would just sit and talk until his mom picked him up. It was a really nice friendship in the beginning. At that time I was having a hard time (mentally) and just needed someone who\u2019d listen to my problems without making me feel stupid for feeling a certain way. \nHe was the only person who\u2019d actually listen to me and help me not feel so alone. \nIn hindsight, I can see how that\u2019d be annoying and exhausting to do. \nHe was also going through things, but he would rarely open up. Maybe he didn\u2019t want to be my friend and stayed with me because he didn\u2019t want to be alone either. I now see that I was clinging on to him, because he was the only friend I could talk to about my feelings. \n\nI think people saw me as a happy person, so they never really asked me about my feelings. \nI also never bothered to share them. (didn\u2019t want to seem needy.)\n\nAt some point we started hanging out outside of school. I would sleepover at his house, go shopping, and travel out of state with his family. Everything was fine, until I\u2019d say something he\u2019d disagree with. He\u2019d usually ignore me. Even when we were with his family, which was really embarrassing. I\u2019m awkward when I have no one to distract me (idk if that makes sense), so those situations were really uncomfortable.\n \nThe last time I traveled with his family was last summer. We were on our way to some art museum in LA. I had said something in the car about feeling homesick (it was the 5-6th day. I\u2019m a wuss.), and he just went off on me. Told me that I shouldn\u2019t have come along if I\u2019d get homesick so quick. Which I agree with, but it still stung. He ignored me for the rest of the ride.\n I was already used to him ignoring me, since we\u2019d already been friends for more than four years. I wish I would\u2019ve said something, but I just stayed quiet. Nobody said anything anyway, so what did it matter. \nWhen we came home, we didn\u2019t talk for a month. Until I went to celebrate his birthday. I ended up sleeping over that night, because we\u2019d gotten along that night. We painted and talked, but he was constantly on his phone. (Which was really hypocritical, because he\u2019d always accuse me of always being on my phone. The only time I\u2019d be on my phone was when we weren\u2019t talking or he was ignoring me.)\n At some point in our conversation he started ignoring me. \nI\u2019ve tried to remember if I had said something that might have upset him, but we were talking about music. How could I have said something rude about music? I knew he hated when we\u2019d listened to the same artist, because god forbid others would listen to the same music as him.\n  I would always avoid talking about liking the same bands as him (even if I\u2019d heard of them years before he did. I\u2019m bitter.). \nMaybe he was just looking for any reason to stop talking to me. \nI ended up leaving his room and going to the living room, to watch movies with his sister. We didn\u2019t talk until the next day. \nHe woke me up to ask me if I wanted to go to a coffee shop with his friend. \nI didn\u2019t want to go. I thought it\u2019d be really uncomfortable. Besides, I knew he was only asking me as a second thought, because he was ready to go and they had already agreed on getting coffee.I ended up going and got along with his friend. It was uncomfortable at first, but it ended up being fine.  \nAnd he had already called her his best friend on some insta post. I know it\u2019s childish to be jealous over something like that (can I blame it on being a girl?).  I already knew our friendship was fading away, but I was still a bit shocked.\nContext: When we became best friends, he would always tell me that you can only have one best friend. idk where he got that idea, but i went along with it. I ended up ditching my other friends. Which is 100% my fault. He never asked me to do that. But it is something I regret.\nI ended up getting along with the girl. \nShe\u2019s sweet.\nI know that it\u2019s probably best for us to not be friends anymore, but I miss having someone to talk to.

I say this daily to myself and no matter what I do I can\u2019t seem to change it. I used to have friends but over the years some have fallen away and then about 1 \u00bd years ago my health issues seemed to scare the remainder away.  The world doesn\u2019t like people with issues or who are sick in anyway. We are broken and useless and yes those are words I have heard from people. \n\nI spend most of my days by myself and in my own head. It sucks, you rip yourself apart in every way possible including asking yourself why you are not good enough to have friends. I miss conversations with other people, fun ones and even intelligent ones. Sure, I have co-workers but those are typically short talks in the hallway and that is about it. Most of them aren\u2019t friends outside the building and trust me, I have tried. I have learned over the years that co-workers usually don\u2019t make great friends anyways. \n\nI remember back in school my parents would tell me it gets easier when you get older to make friends. I have to disagree, I think it is much harder now than it was as a kid. People tend to have more excuses as adults as to why they don\u2019t have time to hang out or talk. The list seems to be endless at times\u2026\n\nPeople are too self-centered now, can\u2019t see past their own world and can\u2019t seem to see the importance of being friends with others. It doesn\u2019t take much to be nice to people or even give them a little bit of time out of your day.

I'm a very social creature, however, and I can enjoy a few beers with friends. But last night, I got well and bloody drunk. On the positive side, I luckily didn't have a hangover today.\n\nAnyway.\n\nBank holiday in Sweden today. The 30th of April is a very big going out night. Walpurgis Eve and all that. I'd been texting a former colleague of mine during the day, who, along with another coworker did their last shift last night after resigning from the store. So drinks to celebrate. \n\nAnyway. The girl who quit is the one I've previously mentioned getting along really well with. The one who always beamed at me when I came back to the store. My other colleague was retiring, so drinks was on him the entire evening. \n\nI'm usually the kind of guy who has one or two craft beers during the course of one evening, but I may have broken that limit last night. :D There was a lot of interaction between myself and the girl during the evening. Some of it even flirtatious. Yet, when all was said and done, and the bars were closing, we parted ways with just a hug and promising we would meet up again in the future (even though there's literally no reason for that to happen).\n\nI was hoping that maybe, just maybe this evening would be different somehow. She invited me. When I arrived, she hugged me, sat down next to me and told me it was really good to see me, her hand on my leg. Even though we both had a lot to drink (she actually drank more, haha), and there definitely was some tension in the air, it again amounted to nothing. \n\nI don't understand the point. I get being friendly is a thing, especially under the influence, but I hate being invited to social gatherings because I'm just \"that funny guy that knows a lot about stuff\". I know this is just my personal experience of the situation, and I do understand that people invite me because they honestly enjoy my company. Still, it always leaves me feeling even more alone in the end, and questioning the reason of my existence. Because after 32 years alive, I still haven't taken a single step close to figuring it out.\n\nIn any case. The next time (if there is a next time, that is) she invites me for drinks, I'm going to be honest about it and say that I wouldn't be interested in it unless her intentions with it are clear.

I was finishing up a few things on my computer, and (since the building was empty) decided to play some music. I hit 'Shuffle' on Spotify, and after a few songs, a slow romantic song started playing. It hit me then, all at once, same as it does every week or so - just how lonely I am.\n\nAt 21, which I know is very young, I've never experienced the warmth of a girl leaning up against me as they look deep into my eyes and smile. I've never held hands with someone, kissed them on the cheek, and sighed just enjoying being in their presence. I've never awkwardly tried and put my arm around someone at the movie theater. I've never stayed up til 3 in the morning talking on the phone with someone.\n\nAt that moment, as the song was playing I thought about how more than anything I would love to slow dance with someone. To have a girl rest her head on my chest/shoulder as I hold her and we sway peacefully back and forth. So - I stood up, and held my hands out in front of me...and fucking pretended to be dancing with someone. I used my imagination like I hadn't since I was 6 years old, and slow danced in the dark with tears running down my face.\n\nI don't really know why I'm posting this. I've not been active much on this subreddit at all before, just lurked some. Is this normal at all to any of you? Have you had any similar experiences? It feels like one of the more genuinely pathetic moments in my life. \n\nAnyways, if any of you read this far, thanks for listening. Stay gold, lonely hearts.", "subreddit": "lonely"}

The diabolical part of all the problems that are frequent on this sub; loneliness, depression, lacking confidence, etc; is that they easily lead the afflicted person in evil circles that pull them further and further down. Being constantly dragged down by life makes you passive, it causes indifference. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt is for this reason that I believe that one of the few  universally true peices of advice that can be given is to resist that negative force and allways remain active in one way or another. I am not saying that it will magically solve all your problems, but it will give you a fighting chance. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nYou might accuse me of being insensitive towards those on here that are truly unfortunate; those that have been abused or unloved from the start, those born with physical and psychological handicaps. And it is true that I am amongst the more fortunate members of this sub, so yeah I will never truly  know the struggles of some of you on here. But I also think that you can always try and do something for your own sake.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy appeal, regardless of however diffuse it might be, is for each and everyone reading this to seek out new things to do in life, new occasions to keep yourself occupied, make connections or simply to gain variation in life. Do not make the mistake of focusing only on the things that seem to be the problems in life.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIn my example I have not had occasions to ever have a SO, and my friends are very few. However I am lucky enough to have those atleast. I had grown more distant form them a while ago and I was afraid of losing them eventually. However I made an effort to keep those relations alive and I am happy to say that we have grown closer than before drifting apart as of late. Again, this does not mean that all my problems will be solved. For instance I have a hard time thinking I will ever have a  SO, but I have learned to live with that thought because I have friends and family that care about me. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nYou might not have my fortune, and there is no doubt of the unfairness of that. But I still beilieve that there are things you can do to keep hope up. Through my friends I have started going places were I will have a sense of belonging even to complete strangers, which was a really unknown feeling for me before. This last part might be corny af, but regardless of were you are in life, regardless of how much life has let you down, keep going for hope is last to die. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHave a good day.", "subreddit": "ForeverAlone"}

I have a couple girl friends I consider close, but one of them is always busy and I hear from her rarely, and the other one cares about me a lot but she is so misguided and in her own world that being around her too much is very toxic for my well being. \n\nI feel like I haven't found \"my people\" yet, and I don't know how. I moved into a single bedroom apartment after having some terrible random roommates. I live with my dog, and I don't mind it.

If you are very disciplined ypu can force yourself to express your personality more (be yourself) or you can share more about your life (put yourself out there.)

Over the last couple of years I have noticed that the people who I would consider my friends and whose lives I make an effort to be apart of have been leaving me out of hangouts and friend activities. Some of those years I was not able to hang out as much as I would have liked due to finishing college, but still made efforts to try and join up when I could.

I invite them to do things or join me each weekend, but that is usually followed up with a maybe and by the end of the weekend I see snaps of everyone hanging out together doing other things.

Two months before I left, at the start of December I was rejected yet again by yet another girl whom I loved dearly and I was a mess, my best friend helped me to get through this bad stage in my life and things started to feel great because his little sister showed a lot of affection for me. I've never been shown so much love in my life, hugs, cuddling, hand holding, I was going crazy and the date I was shipping out come closer by the day.

Oh and here is another problem , she didn't deny me because I'm ugly, or too nice, she couldn't even find a reason she didn't want me. Why is this a problem?

At the same year, I decided to work as operator at i-cafe (basically I did everything from cashier, mopping floor to cleaning toilets). In the next 2 year I open my business and try not to become a burden in my familly. And yes it didn't run smooth as I expected. A year later I finally got my first professional job as an art teacher, yet something really missing. I feel so lost and lonely. No friends, no people to hang out, alone at weekend. \n\nFrom there, I thought if I push myself a little harder I will get a decent job with great workplace and healthy people. So I can really change my self-destruct lifestyle.\nFinally, I got the job I wanted as an artist at multinational edtech company and feel really proud of myself.\n\nI thought I can finally leave my depression, but it's not that easy. The time and strength which allow me to get this point obliterated my social life even worse. Now I am in my first month in my new workplace and people started really think I am a freak and socially awkward. There was a time when I have a lunch and sit down next to a group of my colleagues. They glanced at me with very flat and odd face. I tried to smile at them but they don't respond at all. They always have so much things to talk about, meanwhile I just sit there and blank-gazing at my computer. There was also a time when we went to cinema. The same things happened, I just froze in front of them after the show.\n\nAt first, I think because it's my flat and serious looking impression, I also decline politely when they try to reach me. Is that considered as rude behaviour? I just can't accept every invitation because the same thing could happen and makes me even more sad. I don't know, after everything that I've been through, I'm still looks like a total failure. I'm losing hopes in myself.", "subreddit": "lonely"}

I mean I have heard about it but I never followed it closely or anything anyways let me get to the story. I'm probably a 5 or 6 .....when I dress up and look nice, a 7 tops.\n\nI'm a male, late 30's, and I was a few months out of a long term 14 year relationship and I just didn't have the confidence at the time to date. So I decided to live in fantasy world of sorts. I created a profile on OKC of a person much better looking then myself and of course there were hundreds of interests. Many of these women were absolutely gorgeous and I entertained the fantasy of dating them for a bit nothing crazy. It was a lot of \"you're sexy\" I'd sleep with you type of things. I never solicited nude pictures or anything like that, again this was just for fantasy. I was just about to delete the profile and give the whole account up until I met her.\n\nShe is ten years younger, she has been dating online on and off for a few months. She would consider herself a 5 or 6 but she is beautiful. She's easily a 9 but a 10 to me. She has blonde hair and blue eyes and an amazing smile. At the risk of boring everyone, I'll just come out and say that she was my dream girl. We talked on and off at random, I was very busy and she has her own career as well. I had experienced a death in my family, in real life, and I really didn't want to continue talking to anyone, let alone someone who I won't ever meet. I explained that I was in a tough place and couldn't really focus on another person. I suppose this was my way of trying to say goodbye. Well a month goes by and she texts me and asks me how I am. I was feeling better and I decided to pursue talking to her again, I mean she is beautiful and smart, I couldn't help it.\n\nFor a week or two we texted everyday, we talked about our goals our hopes and our dreams for the future. She wanted everything I wanted, it was really amazing. What is my luck that I am finding a beautiful woman who wants exactly what I want and I'm not even really me. Over these weeks we expressed how lonely we were with our everyday lives and how we should just \"run away\" together and start our own family. This was of course music to my ears, but of course I couldn't tell her why it would never happen but I agreed that is what I wanted too. She really wants to meet up at this point and I need to find a way to deflect that. Well, because I deflected and stayed away she found herself in the arms of another man which of course drove me up a wall, especially because this guy used her and of course he used her again. I was jealous with rage! Imagine that, and of course how terrible is that of me to make her feel bad or worse then she already feels about it?\n\nThis is where our talks and our texts became much more personal and intimate. We shared even more, even things about mental health. Then we started talking on the phone and she has the voice of an angel. I needed to talk to her everyday, she was consuming me, she was absolutely the love of my life. She confided that she felt love for me as well. This began to hurt, this began to make me feel horrible, here I am in love with this beautiful woman who wants everything I want and I realize at this point there is no getting out of this without being hurt. Well, I've been told I am being transferred to a different city and this should be it right?\n\nI grappled with this and of course this hurt her, but she asked everything she could...what about my life here in our city, what about my dog? How can they just move me to a new city? I didn't and still don't want to go, in fact that's a separate story but anyways....I felt bad, she felt bad....I had to come clean with her.\n\nIt was three weeks ago today. She told me that I should just let her love me. I told her that she was in love with my words and not with me, the ugly hideous monster that I really am. She asked me why I kept referring to myself as a monster. I told her that I was going to write/read her a letter that I wrote to her. She kept asking more questions. I suggested we talk on the phone. We talked one last time, I came clean about everything. She was so compassionate and loving about everything, she told me how she understood how this could happen and how the world makes us do things we normally wouldn't. She still wanted to meet in person. I agreed but hesitated in my agreement to do so. She told me that she told her friends right away and they told her she was being too nice to me and of course she was.\n\nShe asked me to send her picture and I told her I was really ugly and she then sent me what she considered an \"uncute\" picture of her, of course it was beautiful. I sent her my picture. Of course she said I was cute. We texted back and forth, mostly me apologizing for being the horrible person I was and for what I did. She told me that the deception was too much for her to overcome and that she has to say goodbye to me. She told me to be well and to treat myself well and that was that. She blocked my number, which is easily known via having iPhones. I presume she never wants to hear from or speak to me again because of that.\n\nAgain, here we are.....21 days later....the karma of what I have done is catching up to me. I think about her all the time. I think about her smile, I think about her voice, her dog, her entire being. I fell completely in love with her and I didn't expect that to happen. We shared songs we like, we shared movies we liked, all of this....I can't listen to these songs, I can't see these movies, I'm of course, never ever going to do anything like this again. Before anyone asks, I completely deleted and removed the profile from OKC. I have learned a valuable lesson from this at the expense of my heart and probably hers also, if she is hurt I would do anything I could to make that go away.\n\nAnyways that's my story. I'm completely heart broken and I can't stop thinking about her and that is my punishment for what I have done.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nUPDATE: I decided out of the blue to text her that I absolutely loved all of her imperfections...and it was received. She texted back that she appreciates that. A few texts back and forth. It was a brief exchange, she is still hesitant and by hesitant, she says she can't be with someone who lied to her. She admitted that I brought her happiness for a fleeting moment and she loved an image of a dog that I sent to her (we're both dog lovers)....anyways not sure it means anything other then she unblocked me for one reason or another.

My ex helped me push a lot of people away and isolate me from basically everyone. It\u2019s hard for me to make friends. I get a lot of hopeful encounters but in the end just get stood up by almost everyone when it comes to the day of hanging out. I try to think positive like maybe it\u2019s just a scheduling issue, but I feel it\u2019s me. But at the same time I don\u2019t know what I\u2019m doing wrong. I just feel like a burden to people. \n\nPeople keep telling me I just need to go do things by myself, but they\u2019re acting like I\u2019m not already doing that. I always go everywhere by myself and I feel so lonely when I do and it makes me not want to go anywhere. Now with summer coming up I\u2019m feeling very anxious about everything. Wanting to go to a lot of places and some are a lot better with more people. I don\u2019t mind doing a lot of things alone but after years of doing it 24/7 is really getting to me. I just wish I could find a friend that wants to spend time with me and just have fun. A relationship doesn\u2019t sound too ideal since I\u2019m freshly out of one and still extremely fragile when it comes to that. It could be a reason I\u2019m feeling so lonely right now. My life was devoured by my ex and now I feel empty that we\u2019re not together. Even though when we were together I didn\u2019t hang out with anyone else since he felt I wasn\u2019t wanting to hang out with him... \n\n\nI just don\u2019t know what to do honestly. I just want to be friends with someone to hang out with throughout the year. Have fun outside or going to the movies. I\u2019ve even put off going to see Captain Marvel and Avengers because I feel so depressed going alone. I really want to go, but it\u2019s just one of those things that me and my ex would always do.

Some of them are funny but I was stupid enough to click a couple of sex related ones. People post about worst sex or most awkward sex with someone. What got to me wasn't the stories but how casual and normal it is to have an active sex life. Something that is as natural to someone as calling someone on a phone is impossible for me. Why is it impossible? Is it because I'm a bad person? I must be a terrible person. Thinking about how I've never even had sex while these people, a few who have come on here and mostly just given meme advice is hurting me. Those questions were rhetorical so please don't try to nitpick probably using the just world fallacy. \n\nEven other stories that have nothing to do with sex but someone just mentioning I woke up next to my significant other or I went to the beach with my significant other show how normal it is for people to have relationships. It's Friday Night and if I think about how people are going out to hook up. People are going out with their significant others. People are experiencing life. If I went out, I couldn't afford it due to being broke, and any kind of socializing just like it was in my 20's would end with me coming home alone. Whatever combination of ugly and socially awkward I am is too unacceptable and at least after giving up, I'm not spending money to go out. Other people have friends to go out with. If they are single they can go out with their friends and have fun. I don't have any friends. I'm sure I will get the usual bro, just go to hobby groups advice but that didn't work for me. I don't think people understand the resources I put in to try and escape FA. I put a similar effort into trying to make friends. Obviously I failed both times because I'm a loser.\n\nThis feeling I have right now is something I wouldn't wish on my worst enemy. It's a combination of depression and loneliness combined with helplessness. There is a huge part of life that I'm not experiencing. I know I have posted I have given up and accepted being FA especially due to events that happened over the past couple of months, but, I will never be able to not be depressed when I see people talk about relationships.\n\nI hate myself more than ever. If any non-FA'er who gives us meme advice had to feel this, they would probably not be able to handle it. It's knowing you tried your best but failed. You put everything you had into it but still failed. The older FA'ers on here know what I'm talking about. \n\nThings like this prove I'm broken as a person. I'm destroyed on the inside. Even a certain Youtuber who is a well known fan of a certain football team who admitted to being an adult virgin who everyone always roasted in the comments found someone. \n\nTell me to stop whining or man up. Shame me. Tell me I never really tried. I don't care. I had a great fall.

That's when I stopped making an effort with them. In the last 6 months, not one of them has contacted me. Maybe I'm being petty by not messaging them but I feel like why should I have to do it all? Friendship takes work from both sides and surely if they were really bothered they would have done something about it. \n\nThis brings me to my current dilemma. In the 6 months since I stopped making the effort with them, the only people I have talked to are my parents and coworkers. Which is fine but they're not *friends* and the conversations are mostly shallow.

{"post_id": "bkprpp", "created_utc": 1557003683, "title": "I don't belong to this society (23M)", "author": "helo98712", "self_text": "First and foremost, I have no intention of hurting myself. I have been on anti-depressants for 2.5 years. Unfortunately for the past 3 weeks I've been feeling severely depressed. I LOST ALL MY CONFIDENCE. It was the thought of EVERYTHING that's wrong with me as a person. Unfortunately my social worker, who has been working with me for 2 years, has currently been away due to an unknown reason for 1.5 months and is indefinitely not at work. I trust her so much because she seems to help me significantly reduce the depression. Without her, I probably would not be alive today. Well, what a perfect time to release my thoughts!\n\nHow it all started. I was on Twitch streaming my favourite game. Over the past 5 days of streaming (before depression started) I averaged 5 viewers despite trying to be very interactive and socialable + somewhat wellknown in the community from my Youtube success. I mean I felt like I could pull in at least 50 viewers on average but that's not the point of this post (WILL NOT disclose my social profiles). So I started to think about my personality and EVERYTHING wrong with my social skills. \n\nI even thought about why I feel so lonely and not have a GF. Seriously almost 24 but never had a GF to this date. I understand people are gonna be like \"you're still young\". Literally 5 years ago, I've had that exact same feeling, which lasted for 6 months. I was able to settle this thought because I enjoyed making videos + playing my favourite game. But 5 years later, it haunts me because my personality is SO BORING. And not just that. Several things are wrong with me. I feel like I'll never be able to get a girlfriend because of the type of person I truly am. Back then I used to use dating sites but this time I refrained myself from this. I just was like \"nah I'm not going through the same shit I've been through\".\n\nSo, WHAT'S WRONG WITH ME?\n\n- I was an introvert. Okay I'm at least proud that I stopped being one and I at least tried to put myself out on the internet. But overall this was the reason why I became the person I was today.\n- I am/was never a good looking person. Judging by my old dating site pics I took and messages sent out, I didn't get a reply due to this. I'm so glad I didn't reveal my face yet but I did promise it will come this summer. This is why I'm depressed is cos I don't know how to make myself look better.\n- I also suck at taking good pics. Seriously this doesn't help when you both look bad + know nothing about how to take pictures.\n- I don't have ANY friends. I couldn't find any friends through college, as I graduated 2 years ago. College was just miserable. I don't want talk about it but yea I was several times more introverted than now.\n- Every single person I meet seems to be \"use or be used\". You may not know this but every person I have spoken to really is just asking me questions because I'm so knowledgeable on this game topic. But on the other hand, when I ask people for things, it's because I want to \"learn something\" out of them. I see this as kind of problematic because I don't want to primarily \"use\" people. For this reason, if I joined a certain community, I don't know how to make myself fit in with others and make conversations that are \"relatable\". \n- I am very boring and bland. I may be presentable on video voice overs for tutorials and such but regardless I am very bland and boring otherwise on Let's Play or stream type videos. I can't think of any funny jokes/memes. I can't really think of ANY things to talk about at times.\n- I have a VERY small list of hobbies. Just gaming and making videos. I do exercise but recently I lost my self-esteem recently. I really don't have very many hobbies which makes me some guy in a box. I'm like a cat who does the same freaking thing every day. This can't happen if I want to thrive in this world. I enjoy(ed) what I'm doing but I don't want come back 5 years later making the same thread.\n- I get jealous and insecure at times. Okay this is ANOTHER HUGE problem with me. This happens because I always seem to have the mindset to know what to expect. I'm not capable of adjusting to problems. I am just that organized. Whenever there's a conflict of some sort, I don't know how to adapt to it. And this is why I feel depressed a lot when I was working. I just couldn't get over why I am a loser at this world. I just feel like I have nothing good to offer.\n- I have too much ego in arguments. Suppose I had an argument with one another and what I said I felt I was right but the person keeps disagreeing (even if I proved it correct). I tend to not drop the topic until they agree unless there's a valid reason they said and I'll back off. I sometimes got to let it go even if I'm right. This is why I get into a lot of verbal fights. I have the inability to take someone's opinion especially if it's wrong.\n- I don't believe in the \"silent treatment\". Okay this is BIG especially if you come out of an argument and someone is mad at you. I am so bad at accepting that nobody wants to talk to you and a lot of times I want to solve this immediately. Imagine if I had a GF right now and I got into an argument that caused her to get mad at me and then I beg her solve the problem. \n- Most importantly, I don't know WHAT TO SAY a lot of times especially conversation starters. I am incredibly terrible at socializing in 1on1 or friendly conversations. I am just that bad. I don't know a good first message. This is the another reason why girls in the past didn't reply my message. It wasn't like I only sent 1 line \"hi\" messages. I sent messages regarding similar hobbies. But yeah it's not just for finding girls that I'm struggling with on first messages. It also applies talking to boys. I just don't know how to network with others.\n\nI know people told me getting a girlfriend isn't right for me but I just feel as a whole, it might train me to being a better person. I feel like I am at a severe disadvantage when it comes to girls choosing other guys over me. I have a lot of issues. But most of them I'd feel sort of less depressed about knowing I am more \"accepted\" in this society. I really want to share my thoughts but obviously I don't want to look depressed if I have a girlfriend. Whatever it is, I am not gonna approach any girl I have a crush on.\n\nThere's a lot that's wrong with me. If I can fix these issues/habits I would be much happier. I know people are like \"be yourself and be positive\". But it's really really hard to if people don't accept you for who you are. Unless these wrongs turn into rights, I will continue to taste the wrath of the mental torture chamber!", "subreddit": "ForeverAlone"}

Often times I find all the usual shit the celebrities say about their \"anxiety\" simply boring and just attention grabbing but Chris Evans said something that stuck with me, two things actually. \nThe first one is that our ego often times tries to think about the future, or the past and put the blame on us, we should stop doing that, we should see where we are right at this moment, not in a minute, not an hour later, exactly now. Obviously this sounds like something that is simple and everyone should know it, but I tried it and sometimes it really gave me a slight boost of motivation to do something for the day even if it was the smallest shit like getting out of my bed and buying groceries, at the end of the day I actually did it.\nAnd the second thing that Chris said was something that he keeps telling often, it's when your brain gets noisy, filled with anxiety, negative emotions, stress that sometimes it's good to just tell yourself \"shhhhhh\". \n\nI'm not better, no where near better even. But in all honesty, listening to him is therapeutic. I rarely if ever even take advice from people, especially when it comes to mental issues where people tend to be overly positive or give bullshit advice, but his advice for whatever reason really give me a little bit of confidence, to know that at the end of the day even such a high status celebrity had and still has his own issues.\n\nI really hope you guys don't downvote me for even trying the slightest to bring positivity here because with the amount of sadness even just a little bit of something that isn't sadness, not even happiness but simply not sadness is enough.", "subreddit": "ForeverAlone"}

Traditional just go about university life, internships, go to bed, maybe work on a side project. I'm slowly but surely recovering from suicidal depression (not suicidal anymore, don't worry), and just spent whatever time I had outside of studying on my side project. Being a nerd, this side project was a deep q learning program capable of learning any basic game \\[like Tetris, or pacman\\] thrown at it. This will be a little important later.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBut one day, as I was playing League of Legends on a smurf account (original one got temporarily locked because of \"intentional feeding\") and I had fun with a few noobs, guiding them through the game. Idgaf if I'm good at the game, this was the first time I ever even, well, talked to a group of people and had fun in about 3 years. Like legit. First time having fun and laughing.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSoon, I became a regular of this group, playing with them every day or every other day, teaching them more about the game. I really enjoyed seeing their progress; just a week ago, they had no idea wtf a Nexus was, now they were learning the basics of map control and keeping track of ultimates.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThen one day, instead of playing League, we all decided to have a video chat. Then damn, there's a cute brunette gamer girl. I figured I had no chance with her since she's a gamer she must have some awesome gamer boyfriend. The only difference between the average gamer and me is that I'm a complete engineering geek as opposed to a gaming geek, keep that in mind. Eventually, as everyone stepped out of the call, it was just her and I. She told me to turn on my webcam (I didn't since I was pretty damn insecure about my appearance and fat), so I reluctantly agreed. She just stared at me with wide eyes and I had no idea wtf was going on. Here's a quick pic of me for reference; I ain't even that hot. I'm 190 lbs and 5'6. [https://imgur.com/2VbOhVa](https://imgur.com/2VbOhVa). I guess this goes to show you never know when a woman gets a crush.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI legit didn't know she had a crush on me until months later. Day by day, every time the group had a skype chat, she'd always make sure to linger around and never drop the call early. Now I know she did that so she could spend more time with me if I chose to not quit the Skype call. Day by day, I started to make my first close friend (who I had a small crush on too; she had a pretty cute and dorky personality. She may not be hot, but she's so fucking cute! Especially with her plushy Pikachu!!!!). Apparently, she has a thing for nerds. She's been obsessed with Elon Musk, Bill Gates, etc because apparently school nerds turn her on.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAs she says: \"Who cares about fat and muscles when a man can be so damn worldly and smart. It's not the guys with muscles who get rich and powerful, it's the school nerds. You are so passionate about what you learn in class, I envy that passion.\". In today's day and age, the new definition of success is in direct correlation with one's intelligence. Especially when it comes to the best influential people in the world. When I showed her my deep q learning program, she lost it. All this time, she thought that only the guys with Ph.D.'s working at Google did shit like this, but I'm just a mechanical engineering student doing a side project. She fell for me so damn hard.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow, guys, here's what sealed the deal with her. This is what turned this from her crush to us becoming a loving couple. After all, crushes fade away. She's been through some rough times, parents divorcing, abusive ex, and mental health issues. I'm sure most here can relate to this. But with her as my closest friend, I was always there for her. I was, in a sense, the \\*\\*\\*nice guy\\*\\*\\* that people here dread. I showed her true compassion and empathy and helped her fight her way out of depression (while bringing myself up too). This is what built oxytocin in her mind. Oxytocin is the \"love hormone\". She no longer crushed on me, this was actual deep feelings for me and vice versa.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTogether, we stood up for each other during our darkest times. This brought us together closer than ever. We really understood what each of us was going through. We both saw the light out of depression together, we always made each other happy. We gave each other a sense of purpose.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow, get this. She's the one that asked me out cuz I was too much of a pussy to do so.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe key to a girl's heart isn't your appearance or money. It's what you can give to her emotionally. The initial crush on me only acted as a catalyst for her to want to know me. But the actual love started when we got to know each other.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLet this be hope for all you forever alone guys out there. I was one of you until the very day she asked me out. Girl's arent this mystical creature we think they are. They're just humans with vaginas. Everything you feel and experience, a girl can experience too (aside from stuff like morning woods).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBeing a math geek, here's a formula I have for you guys:\n\nP(r) = probability of being in a relationship\n\nalpha = arbitrary constant (for arbitrary units)\n\nNw = number of women met in total (coworkers, acquaintances, gamer buds) \\[range: 0, 3.5 billion; avg: 1,000 est\\]\n\nPa = Personal attractiveness factor (ie. money, muscles, confidence, etc) (between: 0, 10)\n\n`P(r) = alpha * (Nw * Pa)`\n\nTake me for example; I rank myself a 3/10. This means to get a girlfriend like the 10/10 chad, I have to meet 3.3 times more women. Sure I may not get girls easily, but it's all about who you meat and how many. It truly is a numbers game.\n\n\\[note the oversimplification of linear relationships; the trend will vary with different function types, but the general principle is the same.\\]\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI know that some people may not have a high personal attractiveness factor, like me. But the more women that you meet, the probability of you being in a relationship increases. So guys, get out there, met as many girls as you can, the probability indicates that you WILL find a girl that will take notice in you. The probability any girl won't take interest in you out of a couple thousand you meet in your life is slim. It's there, but slim.", "subreddit": "ForeverAlone"}

If you aren't engaged in society with everyone else, you have more time to research the religion and pray. God wants to guide you which is why he's taken you away from the temptations of modern society. \n\nThere's also islam where arranged marriage exists so you don't have to go out and seek also partner. There's also promise of 72 virgins in paradise for men which means that you may have no woman who desires you in this life, but if you stay loyal Allah you will have women in the afterlife. \n\nIn Hinduism,  the concept of karma and reincarnation exists so if you have someone who is rude to you in this life they will be punished when they're reincarnated or they will receive their punishment in the body they are currently in. \n\nThose are just a few examples. I feel as though religion was created for the social outcast type of person though. I don't believe in these religions though because I know they were just created as copes for social outcasts, to give us hope that it will get better, if not in this life then the next. That just isn't true though. If you're a social outcast with no bf or gf by age 14 then it's likely you'll stay that way for the rest of your life.", "subreddit": "ForeverAlone"}

Since the age of 8 (maybe even younger) I loved anime and gaming, just little things to keep me entertained, and also making friends at school with the same interests as me.\n\nI used to enjoy my own company and being alone (I still do) but just recently, usually late at night when I am indulging in my own company, I start to check my notifications every 5 seconds. Thinking that someone will magically appear to talk to me.\n\nYes, I know that if I started striking up a conversation with someone, then problem solved? Well that is partially true. \n\nBut one main issue that I would love to just forget is that, I'd really want to talk to someone with the same interests as me. In which at my school, finding someone that likes both gaming and anime (or even just one), is pretty fucking difficult to say the least. \n\nAnd so with that I've tried to talk to girls and yes to some degree it was fun, but the conversations were as stale as oxidised crackers. \n\nIt's kinda really hard talking to people that don't have the same interests in the first place, and even making them try also really difficult, unless the certain someone is willing to, in which most cases most likely not. \n\nBut of course, I am only 16 and school is just a small part of a person's life, and relationships in highschool aren't even that significant. But just, sometimes, I wished I would open my notifications to someone that I would love to have close to me.\n\nEdit 1: I just read all this over (after I post it, which is quite dumb) and it's pretty cringe, I'm very sorry.

So, I said \"I feel kind of awkward sitting here lurking \ud83d\ude05 you're really, really good though \ud83d\ude0a\" she read this and said, \"don't feel awkward haha you're completely fine\" and then within about 3 seconds literally every single person in the stream chat called me by my full name (it's in my account name on IG), and told me I was weird/creepy/a loser.

Basically I have a job and a decect upper middle class life, and despite a long spell of addiction/recovery, I have a life most people would be happy with. \n\nExcept socially... Since I was 5 I have been unable to relate to people or make friends. I have acquaintances at work but we all know those don't count. I have gone through times with people where I petend to be someone I am most definitely not (aka someone who normal people will and can associate with/sleep with/invite to baseball games/go with to concerts or barbecues, etc.) but at the end of every day when I an alone, doing this makes me break down and cry and I am in a great deal of emotional discord/pain that literally hurts my head, shoulders, back, and gives me a headache and the most crippling depression with the inability to sleep without heavy medication. Plus I spend all night having bad dreams and I wake up wishing I had died in my sleep.\n\nI am not ugly or fat, I am well spoken and intelligent, I travel a lot, I read a lot, I am good at speaking (from a purely neutral perspectice) and even joking around at times. I am not some disfigured or disadvantaged person with a visible physical/mental issue.\n\nAnytime I become \"close\" to a person, especially a girlfriend, I start to show my true self and they become annoyed and frightened (not in a case of physical harm, just in a \"boy have I met a damaged crazy person\" sort of way). Nobody sticks around after I show that side if myself. Or I make sure to \"break up with them\" if it moves in that direction. Same with platonic make friends.\n\nIf I lie (in every sentence) I can act like a regular person, but then I am living a lie to everyone I know and it isn't fair and is difficult to maintain. I have never looked into anybody's eyes no matter how \"well I know them\" and had anything except for the same sense of connection I have to a random rock I might pick up off thr ground. There is absolutely NO connection or honesty involved. Thus why I never make eye contact to ANYBODY. I have spent every moment outside of work alone for the past 3 years, my last 12 birthdays alone, and my last 11 Christmases and NYEs alone.\n\nI have attempted to solve it with religion, spirituality, meeting similar people, support groups, hundreds of illicit drugs, dozens of psych meds, and 20 years of therapy with 5 different professionals. Not one thing has improved, it gets worse every day, and it has come to the point where living causes, uenexagerratedly,truly unbearable amount of pain. It has only gotten worse and recently I have told everybody I know the truth and that I cannot associate with then because I \"put on a full-blown act\" and they do not know me and Ibhabe basically broken up with all my friends. For 3 years I have spent every non-work moment of my life alone, and if a stramger talks to me I have a panic attack and quickly walk away.\n\nI have never, ever, ever had a friend with whom I act myself, and I know for a fact I never will. I have given up on lying, and everytime I see people tofether in public beint friendly with each other (I live in a huge city and take public transportation so this is often) I physically shudder, start yelling at myself under my breath, and my vision goes blurry. I run away if/when possibe, otherwise I sweat and have problems breathing until I can.\n\n7 years ago a \"friend\" forced me to take 2 kittens (littermates) and they have been my only friends ever. If they didn't rely on me to feed them, I would have killed myself years ago (I do know the correct chemical combination with no pain and 100% success rate and I can obtain anything) but this is not fair to the cats and I cannot stand the idea of them being euthanized or separated because they are so accustomed to their brother/sister routine.  I know they will get over my passing as long as they remain together so that does not concern me. I also know a better life awaits them rather than being taken care of by someone who can barely muster the energy to play with them.\n\nI am certain that I will finish myself off once they are dead, or once I can rest assured I have them sortedout.\n\nMy question is, what are my options for ensuring they are together and in good hands for life when I am gone? Surely a program exists, a kind, openminded, and understanding stranger is reading, and/or a contract can be created? I should mention there is an amount of money involved that passes on to them and should cover them for the rest if their life.\n\nAny ideas?", "subreddit": "lonely"}

Some background info: I'm 17 and I have social anxiety and bipolar disorder. I prefer being by myself normally, except when I am having a manic episode. I don't have any friends, but part of that is by choice, I suppose. I have a hard time relating to other people. I am not sure why this is. It could possibly be due to my anxiety in social settings, but I feel  like it might be something more. \n\nI have tried hanging out with all types of people from all walks of life, but none of those relationships lasted or progressed beyond a very superficial level. I do not get other people's humor, so I fake laugh to be socially accepted. I crack myself up all the time, yet no one else gets my humor. Sometimes I wonder if some people are just meant to live in their own company. I keep pondering this, but I can't shake this feeling of extreme loneliness and longing for a deep, I timate connection.\n\nI don't think I have autism, but that could be a possibility. I also feel like I don't belong in \"normal society\" mainly due to my bipolar disorder. I feel like if people knew my true self, and what goes on in my mind, and how I can be just fine one moment, then homicidal or suicidal the next, they would run away from me. This also makes me feel lien I can't trust myself around others, because I don't know what I am capable of. I can switch at any minute, and I have no control over it. \n\nI don't mean for this to be a \"woe am I\" post. Sorry if this sounds like one. I just want some insight and encouragement. I want to go out and socialize, but I am also very afraid to do so. Any help or personal stories would be greatly appreciated. Thanks", "subreddit": "lonely"}

About a year ago I discovered the MGTOW philosophy and it kinda helped out with suicidal thoughts, but they came back recently, about 2 months ago or so.\n\nI live with my parents who are no longer a couple, and my brother who's divorced and has two children. I have a fulltime job as security guard in a condo and have several sporadic illustration jobs here and there. Sometimes I work as a translator or teaching some classes.\n\nI no longer see see the point in working and having money, I barely see it, it all goes in paying my mom's bills and covering the house expenses. My mom acquired a lot of debts from getting credits from banks and stores to cover my brother's children's health expenses because my nephew is deaf from birth, and my brother never did anything to pay those bills. The son a bitch even insinuated that he wanted to kill himself. My mom even tried to pay him the university twice and my brother brother dropped out twice. \n\nAll those debts are my burden. All my mom's wage goes to pay her other debts, and she keeps on getting more and more and I have to pay it. My wage, in the other hand, goes to pay my student loan and the house expenses, and so my father's. I barely buy anything for myself, sometimes some cookies or a soda and that's all, unless I hide that I buy something more expensive. I'm playing Digimon Masters Online, and I wanted to buy some stuff to speed up my success and make my game experience better, but I can't do it because I'm running out of money.\n\nAs I mentioned before, I'm virgin, I have never had anything remotely similar to a girlfriend. If it wasn't for the internet I wouldn't even know what breasts are. I been relaying in my barely explored sexuality my whole life to sustain my pointless existence. That's why I studied illustration and design in the first place, so I can have some level of dominance over the female form, at least over my character's bodies, I tried to to vent my sexual frustration via my drawings but it wasn't as satisfying as I thought, and the fact that I can't share it with anybody makes it even less effective.\n\nA few days ago I discovered Martina Finoccio and I wanted to buy her photo sets. When I went to buy them I saw that I could pay with PayPal, \"thank god\" I thought, but when I went to check out, PayPal wanted me to associate a credit card to the account in order to pay. Once again I bite the dust.\n\nMy mom has a few acres of land in the country far away from my city house, and there's a house there. I thought about going there and shoot myself in the head the old shotgun that my grandfather had in his house. I know my uncle fixed it several years ago and it can shoot. I read that a shotgun shot to the head is one of the most effective suicide methods. It has less than 1% of failure rate and it's quick and painless.\n\nI remember that a friend of my family once told me that life was worth it in every case, because there are always little things that give life meaning, but it seems that's not my case at all. \n\nThe scary part is that suicide thoughts were absent for several months, and now they're back, I thought I had moved over but I was wrong.", "subreddit": "ForeverAlone"}

But since I\u2019ve come to university I literally have had no one, and it honestly annoys me how everyone seemed to find friend groups to hang out with the first few weeks, and even tho I made an active effort to try and be socialI was never really included and ended up alone after everyone already had formed groups and it wasn\u2019t really possible to fit in with anyone anymore. \nI do have lots of acquaintances I\u2019m on friendly terms with but I imagine that\u2019s true for many of you here too and you probably know how it is. \n\nSo this year I was really determined to give it my best shot, it seemed to work for a bit, most of the groups I tried being friends with stopped hanging out with me but this time I did manage to make some friends and hang out quite a bit this year, text often and what not. \n\nComes my birthday again, and I try to organise something. Of course everyone is too busy for it and no one even tries to make it sound any better, just treat it like it\u2019s no big deal. \n\nI ended up putting on my best clothes and ordering delivery from my favourite restaurant just so I could feel like at least I had done something and it hadn\u2019t been just a day like any other. Ate alone in front of my computer and drank the rest of the night. \n\nIt was probably the saddest and most pathetic thing I\u2019ve ever done and I kind of needed to get it off my chest but it\u2019s not something I would ever tell anyone I know in real life. \nThe weird thing is that it didn\u2019t feel as bad as I thought it would, not as much as last year.

The number of guys who aren't sexually active has tripled. Guys are having trouble becoming financially secure in their 20's. A majority of posters on here are guys in that age range who are struggling whether just being FA or struggling to become financially secure or even to just have friends.\n\nI saw a video earlier today about this and it's been something I've been thinking about for a while. These groups with extreme beliefs actively recruit vulnerable FA'ers in that age range because society instead of being supportive, has instead decided to make fun of them or call them names. When you don't have any friends, some of us don't even have a supportive family, and we can't find people to have relationships with that provide very important companionship, we become more withdrawn. When social media is insulting you, eventually you try to find support from anyone. These extreme groups who on paper hate each other need each other. These groups actively recruit the most vulnerable people who have nobody for support. Both sides prey on FA'ers because they don't have any support. I remember in my 20's when I tried to find support but just found people insulting me. So called support groups were anything but supportive and didn't tolerate someone like me. I found this sub but I was being recruited and even joined some places that had some extreme views. The support I found from this sub caused me to realize what was happening and I backed off. It's why I worry about some of the younger posters on here. \n\nI don't have any solutions. I just know when you are at your lowest, you become vulnerable to groups who prey on people who have no support. It's why I will always be neutral. I'm sick of this crap between these two sides who come off like they hate each other, but deep down they know they need each other. You can't recruit vulnerable people who have been rejected by society without having a villain to say those people are why you are FA. \n\nI apologize for the rant but knowing how prone FA'ers in their late teens and 20's can be to these groups disturbs me. If anyone tries to get you to join a group that is dedicated to blaming, harassing, or bullying, know that they don't actually care about you. They care about using you for whatever their groups is dedicated to. \n\nDoes this makes sense to anyone? I've been thinking about it. It seems I'm not alone.", "subreddit": "ForeverAlone"}

We don't just live with others but also through them and in them. They place us and ground us into the world. When they see us, they identify us. After all, what is identity but the slow, lifelong accretion of gazes: us looking at ourselves being looked at by others? What we see is, largely, what they see, or what we think they see. And when they turn away, when we become unseen, in a way we cease to be.\n\nRejection doesn't have to come from family, or even people you know, to do harm. Nor does it have to be particularly overt. In insidious forms, it lurks woven into the very fabric of society.\n\nThe best predictor today in Europe or North America of who will be depressed is not a gene and it\u2019s not a measure of your brain; it's whether you\u2019re poor.\n\nThe lower your status at work, the shorter your life.\n\nSome claim that socioeconomic status doesn't cause ill health, but that ill people, having a harder time in school or at work, simply tend to 'drift' to the bottom of the social ladder.\n\nSocial status carries an implicit judgment of one's value to society. The higher up the ladder you are, the more respect and admiration you command from those around you. By contrast, being lower down the hierarchy implies a failure to live up to society's standards of success. It is to be judged as lacking and seen as inferior; in other words: to be rejected. The rejection might be implicit but, if anything, that makes it \neven more pernicious because it goes unquestioned: we often accept social inequality the way we inhale polluted air, or we justify it as a matter of merit. So if you find yourself near the bottom, you can feel worthless, hopeless and helpless.\n\nA growing number of researchers now recognise that threats to our social identity, such as being negatively evaluated by others, can tamper with crucial neurobiological systems.\n\nSocial rejection triggers inflammation \u2013 the body's innate response to injury. Just as with physical threats, social ones can signal mortal danger, setting off a defensive immune attack against microbial intruders.\n\nWhether people live in a shack with an earth floor and no sanitation or in a three-bedroom house with fridge, washing machine and television, low social status is experienced as overwhelmingly degrading.\n\nNo matter how much you achieve, someone is always above you. Status, it seems, is a game you can never win because the target keeps moving, a game in which every success can also be a failure, and every winner \u2013 a loser.\n\nSocial isolation increased a subject's likelihood of being dead at the end of the study by 29 percent.\n\nPeople can be a social outcast in their own minds even while living among others.\n\nIt is in our minds, perhaps, that rejection reveals itself at its most insidious \u2013 not in the pricks of pain it sends through our skulls, nor in the havoc it wreaks on our bodies. In the mind, rejection can live on, fed by nothing more than our own twisted imaginations. To perceive yourself as isolated means to be rejected over and over, even when in reality no one is slighting you. It is to be, at once, the one rejected and the one who rejects. This is how rejection ultimately hurts us \u2013 by making us hurt ourselves, complicit in its cruel act.", "subreddit": "ForeverAlone"}

But we even managed that problem and could return to being best friends again.\nFast foreward to now. She has had a boyfriend for a long time now, but their relationship is completely messed up. The only reason she doesn\u2018t end it, is because she fears that he would kill himself if she did. I was her support throughout the whole thing. And again it happend what had to happen.

But it\u2019s fresh and I could really use some words of direction. \n\nI won\u2019t try and justify my actions because they\u2019re inexcusable and I\u2019ll jump right into it. I\u2019m a male and catfished another guy. \n\nI was catfishing this guy for approximately two years I would say. We met via a videogame. It started off innocent enough. Simply genuinely enjoying his friendship, and the endless night we\u2019d play until the sunrise. \n\nAt some point it became more than that. We were clearly interested in eachother. We grew out of the game but never eachother. This sort of back and forth carried on for who knows how long. \n\nAt one point we even \u201ctook a break\u201d from eachother because he wanted to pursue \u201canother\u201d girl. I secretly prayed it was going to work out so that I could cut him free. This guy became truly one of my best friends. \n\nSadly this wasn\u2019t the case. They didn\u2019t work out and I was to weak to embrace the persona and pick up the pieces. As selfish as it was, I wanted to pick them up. I wanted him to go back to being happy. \n\nFast forward to a few moths ago, two years or so in, things are far more intimate than they were. Not necessarily on a sexual level since we had been far past that, but just on a spiritual level. I\u2019d be waiting up until 6 am every morning to make sure he was on time for work etc etc. at some point without my knowledge I genuinely fell in love with this guy. I stopped just loving him and am now in love with him. Get what I\u2019m saying? \n\nBoth of us struggle with our own mental battles, just like all humans do. And recently he\u2019s been having more bad days than good, I always try my best to do whatever I can to make him feel even slightly better. At the end of the day all I wanted was his happiness.\n\nBut I knew in my heart that these promises of children and dates that I was making. These dreams we would have of eachother. I knew I could never provide them for him. And they\u2019re certainly something he deserves. But I also know that he fell in love with this persona I had cultivated. Not me. \n\nI knew I had to cut him free. Every morning it would make me physically sick to my stomach. Trying my best to provide happiness for someone I\u2019m directly hurting. \n\nI can\u2019t tell you how many times he\u2019s asked to drive to me in the middle of the night just because he was lonely. I can\u2019t tell you how many times I\u2019ve cried having to say no. \n\nHe deserves better than me. \n\nJump forward again to two nights ago. He has a particularly rough day. Asks if he could see me soon. Tells me he\u2019s not happy etc etc. things that break my heart to hear. I just couldn\u2019t take it anymore. I for the first time did anything even remotely decent and decided I had to tell him. \n\nI\u2019d like to preface this by saying I\u2019ve tried (according to him at least 3 times) to \u201cget us to see other people\u201d   With the third time being this last time. It was a cowardly way out that I was trying to take but I just wanted him to get out and find somebody he deserved. \n\nBut I just couldn\u2019t do it anymore. I spent too long hoping he would catch on and call me out or find someone better or even just give up on the chase. It wasn\u2019t happening so I couldn\u2019t be the cause of his suffering anymore. Especially not when he was already dealing with his own battles. \n\nSo I broke down, told him everything said my final goodbyes. I knew that losing him at least meant he would finally be able to get over something that didn\u2019t exist. Much like the coward that I am I tried to block him before he could respond. But he was already prepared for this and his answer was locked and loaded from the start. \n\nHe had already known. Literally everything. Even before I started intentionally dropping clues in an attempt to give myself away. From the start he knew I wasn\u2019t a girl he was able to figure out who I was. I was sloppy. Before I even intended to be. \n\nStill he fought for me. Even thanked for me for finally coming clean. Words I don\u2019t deserve. Because it wasn\u2019t anything new to him, he wasn\u2019t shell shocked like me. And him having known about it and played along didn\u2019t soften the blow either. \n\nIt forced me to confront my own demons and see myself for the monster that I was. And at that moment sitting in his acceptance is when it sunk it. That I am in love with him, and that I spent two years just about deliberately hurting him for my own selfish gain. \n\nAnd now to hear that with all my monsters brought to light, that he still loves me and not just my persona but actually me? It\u2019s almost soul crushing that I did what I\u2019ve done to him. \n\nIf he\u2019s willing to have me as I am, I\u2019m willing to try and be everything he deserves and more. But the problem is, no matter how many times he tells me it\u2019s okay or to stop apologizing I can\u2019t shake this sense of dread in my stomach. \n\nIt\u2019s entirely possible that I\u2019m over reading it, but the night that I came clean and confessed once we got past all the tears and what not it felt like time stopped. Like he really had accepted me and my persona as one and it didn\u2019t matter to him. \n\nBut now in the following two days I feel he\u2019s been slightly distant. Someone who usually would love to hear from me at all hours now seems only half there. \n\nI thought that\u2019s what he wanted was me right there whenever, so I\u2019ve been trying to stay in contact as much as I can around both of work schedules. \n\nI want him to know that the events in my life I was sharing with him were real. I had informed him about my sick grandmother, and would often use her as a trump card for why we couldn\u2019t. While time frames may have been fudged a bit it certainly wasn\u2019t entirely a lie. If it weren\u2019t for her being as ill as she was I wouldn\u2019t have even come across him.  I wanted to keep it as close to the truth as I could. I didn\u2019t want to just be feeding him bs \u201cmy sister has cancer, I was hit by a car\u201d lines. I always genuinely wanted him to be a part of my life. \n\nBut the problem is how is he supposed to trust me after what I did to him. I wouldn\u2019t trust me if I were him. \n\nAll I want is to show him that the things I was saying to him and the feelings I had and were conveying were real. But I know this is just as hard if not harder for him. He might have known for however long beforehand. But it was never official until now. \n\nI\u2019m trying to take into account his feelings, I just want him to know that his feelings even if they\u2019re good or bad are justified and that I want to validate his feelings and emotions. \n\nI\u2019m so incredibly grateful that he can even stomach looking my way. Let alone making plans with me for the following weekend. \n\nI don\u2019t know what to do. I don\u2019t know how to tell him these things. I don\u2019t want to blow up his phone if he needs space.\n\nBut he spent two years just beyond my fingertips. If he\u2019s willing to let me then I want to do whatever it takes to hold him close. I just can\u2019t shake this horrible feeling that at any second it\u2019s going to fall apart.", "subreddit": "lonely"}

What I mean is that it seems like a lot of people who post here have fairly bad social skills and don't have an active social life, and probably wouldn't know what to do in a relationship once they got one. I don't mean that in an accusatory way, some people just haven't learned social skills yet, that doesn't make you a bad person. But wouldn't you rather develop social skills first and create a more active social life? I feel like if you got that, a relationship would come naturally over time anyway. \n\nTo be clear, I'm not posting as a total outsider. I'm 21 haven't been on a date or kissed a girl or whatever either, but I wouldn't want to do it without being ready for it.

My title reference the song, by Benny Blanco, Halsey, and Khalid. It\u2019s a beautiful song right? About summertime, youthful, vibrant love, when feelings first brew between two people, exploring a whole new world of possibilities as you grow up and explore the realm together. I guess to most people you\u2019d think back to that special girl/guy and relate to the song, you\u2019d look back and remember in school, at prom when you first kissed, made love and did these things which are sure to stimulate such a glow inside you. You might have already picked up with my over theatrics that I have a different take on the song from the one that I feel most people have, the reason it might\u2019ve been so popular. To me the song resembles everything I didn\u2019t have at school. Everything I don\u2019t have now and everything I feel like I\u2019m missing out on. It makes me reflect now, while one by one all my friends, had girlfriends, experienced different things and emotions I\u2019m yet to feel. I feel like I\u2019m totally fucking up on this one, just can anyone relate this? Does the song make anyone else cry? To me it was just a huge slap in the face and a realisation for the first time that wow I\u2019m lonely. Even worse, as I\u2019ve gotten older I\u2019m probably further than I\u2019ve ever been to being in a relationship. Like I can hardly sustain conversation with a girl, I hardly have the opportunity to attempt to sustain a conversation with a girl and I just don\u2019t see how it gets any better. At my University I often see guys and girls walking around together, I mean that in the mixed and segregated sense and most of the time I just feel ashamed to be walking around by myself all the time. I guess all I\u2019m really trying to say is I regret never having someone to love or someone that\u2019s ever loved me. It haunts me to this day and not a single day goes where I wish I just had that someone in my life to be myself with, to just goof the fuck around since that\u2019s what I\u2019m like without all the angst.

Maybe there's an alien race that is connected thelepatically, so they feel each others emotions as their own, therefore they wouldnt be so mean to each other. I think the age of the internet is something powerful, it lets us already share some thoughts we would otherwise never speak of in real life. Every morning and everytime before falling asleep I loose my motivation because life seems so meaningless. Do most people just seem to fit into society? Are they really happy, because I think deep down most of us are truely sad. If you look around all the angry people are just very sad people (I discovered a friend of mine who had this behaviour). The bad thing is if you hang out with those people they start being mean to you , but then sometimes they apologize. So you never know if you should get rid of those people since their negativity drowns you or just look away from those traits and help this person to cope with life. And then you feel just isolated and alone because your \"friends\" are pretty mean. Being a loner changed my life in a happy way, although I would like some human contact. I just cant stand the negativity anymore. (However I still have contact with those people but I stopped calling them my friends in my mind)Being alone can be so peaceful and yet so painfull.  My mum has cancer and due to her chemotherapy her mood changed into a bad behaviour. She gets angry really quick and yells at me, but I just dont respond because I somehow think its not her fold. All people in pain are angry. And then the people surrounded by those get depression. Is it the rule of life? (Angry=Sad?)\n\nMay there be no meaning life, we still stand up every day trying our best (or worst). How do you guys deal with feeling isolated, surrounded by negative people, feeling not being worth anything for others? Does anyone also feels like this life is a joke? Therefore I cant be serious arround people anymore when they get angry. I just think what will it mather in 100years when we are all dead? Theres not really a meaning in life its the concept of the human mind like everything else we experience. After one long existential crisis you cant take anything serious anymore.\n\nSitting here contemplating life I just wanted to get my thoughts out, thanks for reading!", "subreddit": "lonely"}

We\u2019re both pretty introverted, prone to feeling lonely and craving connection, not sexually driven to the extent some of our other friends are, we always laugh at each other\u2019s jokes/ what we say. I think we both share anxiety about a lot of things.\n\nI don\u2019t know if I\u2019m just completely wrong, but when we look at each other I feel like there\u2019s this unspoken feeling that we just kind of \u201cget\u201d each other.  We don\u2019t hangout outside of a group setting really, and don\u2019t text each other much, but I still feel it.\n\nMy other friend just started dating her after two years of them being best friends. I\u2019m excited for them; I knew I\u2019d never be as close with her as he is - they became close pretty much immediately after we met her - and I never had any intention to pursue her. Our friend group has kind of been waiting for this to happen, it was seen as inevitable. They work so well together and are pretty much inseparable. \n\nEven if he wasn\u2019t in the picture I don\u2019t think anything would have developed. Because we\u2019re really similar, neither of us would get the other to open up in any significant way. But we still share a connection, I think.\n\nFor my birthday last year, along with a little gift she wrote me a little letter on a flash card that was so warm and genuine I kept it the whole year. The other week one of my friends texted me asking to go to a festival (were in New Orleans). I said sure, and she said she would ask J too. A few minutes later she texted me again - a screenshot of their conversation. J, when she learned I was coming, said \u201cwait he\u2019s my favorite person\u201d. She\u2019s not the woo girl type to just say something like that. It made my day and weekend, and still makes me feel warm when I think of it. \n\nIt makes me a bit wistful and hopeful. The fact that there are people out there whom I can understand and who understand me, the fact that I can feel a connection with someone without even being that close with them. I guess I feel like we\u2019re kindred spirits in a way, I don\u2019t know. Again maybe I\u2019m just romanticizing it way too much. But I\u2019ve had crushes and cringy longings for girls before, and this isn\u2019t that.\n\n It makes me emotional.

We need to unite under this ultimate goal!", "author": "[deleted]", "self_text": "I don\u2019t know about you guys but I\u2019m sick of being shunned or used. Today I\u2019ve realized that throughout my life I\u2019m either shunned or used by my so called friends. Long post ahead, but maybe it will help you see the light. We have an advantage that others don\u2019t have. \n\nFirst up is being shunned for complimenting women. Im sure all of us here have tried to compliment women in the past, and were called weird or creeps, or just nothing positive. The compliment wasn\u2019t even inappropriate either, maybe you told her that her hair was nice or her eyes looked beautiful. In return, you get disgust. It\u2019s sad when you try and make someone feel good and they take that and negate it. 2nd is being shunned by your friend group. Maybe your friends all hung out at Toms place but no one invited you. Then you get to hear about all the fun that happened at Toms for the next couple of days. We are the outcasts. \n\nThen there is the possibility you\u2019re being used. Maybe instead of that girl being disgusted by your compliments, she uses them to her advantage. She doesn\u2019t like you, but she likes being validated so she keeps you under her wraps, by making you think she likes you. Then when you ask her out she\u2019ll give you a vague answer or dodge the question, but fish for compliments instead. You\u2019ve become her validator, and it\u2019s almost worse than being shunned. Maybe those same friends that went to Toms are bored on today and wanna play Xbox with you. Your friends only seem to hang out with you on the internet, but never hang out irl. Maybe they tease you more than anyone else. This isn\u2019t as easy to notice since it\u2019s not always true, but you could possibly be used as entertainment. Maybe your friend just texts you their relationship problems, but never wants to hear yours. Again, we\u2019re outcasts. \n\nIdk about you but I\u2019m sick of being treated this way. Being used or shunned, it\u2019s just picking my poison. Throughout life, I\u2019ve mostly kept my true feelings to myself because I\u2019ve been though all those experiences I listed above. I don\u2019t seem to connect with people emotionally like others do... maybe it\u2019s my apathy and indifference towards the world. Or the fact that I simply don\u2019t trust anyone.  I\u2019ve never felt love for anyone outside family and even they have used and shunned me throughout my life. I mainly keep quiet, and judge the world internally.\n\nIt\u2019s time for us to change. We first need to make sure we\u2019re making as much money as possible. Money is essential in this world, and if love isn\u2019t something I can achieve at least we can gain and save money. Second, it\u2019s time to hit the gym. Idk if any of you do, I personally don\u2019t yet but I have plans to start going during the summer. I\u2019m a very skinny guy, and I could look way more fit, so I want to change myself, I suggest you all do the same. Don\u2019t do it for women, do it for yourself. Set goals, and achieve them. Once we are more fit, and look ripped we already surpass at least 70-80% of the male population in looks since so most people are lazy and don\u2019t exercise and rather stay that way. Then we can do a number of things. You can try to use your new good looks to try and seduce women. \n\nPersonally seducing women is not my goal, women will just annoy me with drama and get in the way of my ultimate goal, which is to move out of my hometown. At least right now I seem to be a repellent for romance. So I will most likely stay FA by choice, and give women the same disgust they have given me over the years. Especially if women of the past see my growth. Most couldn\u2019t accept me for my true self then, so they don\u2019t deserve me at my full potential. Only a few women accept me as I am. I don\u2019t care if I\u2019m still  a virgin in 12 years when I turn 30,  if I am ripped, healthy and rich then I am winning in life. No one will shun me if I am of higher class, and look ripped. I encourage you to also focus on money and gains. If we\u2019re FA let\u2019s use it to our advantage, I\u2019m sure we all have very drama free lives since none of us have a girlfriend. This means we have **freedom** not many others have. We need to take advantage of that! We are free of drama since we have very monotone lives, so we could easily focus time into going to the gym or other self improvement opportunities.

Fast forward a few weeks to when I built up the courage to ask her on a date; I asked her out on a date specifically so there was no confusion as to whether it was just a friendly hangout or a date. She initially said yes but said she had to work so I should text her later and we could figure something out. I texted her the next day to set something up and that\u2019s when she explained that she had a boyfriend that I had not heard a thing about this entire time. She said with respect to him she would not go out with me, and said she felt bad for possibly leading me on. I probably shouldn\u2019t have done this but I creeped on her social media and found out that she was not lying about the boyfriend.\n\nThis was only a couple of weeks before the end of the semester and we only saw each other a few times during that span, we didn\u2019t talk in person again but still had conversations through text. Following the end of the semester she transferred to a major university 12 hours away. We haven\u2019t talked in 5 months now but I still think about her pretty often and I really miss her and our friendship. I know I should probably just forget about her and move on and I\u2019ve tried to do that but I haven\u2019t been able to. \n\nI\u2019m sorry if this was long but I have nobody in my life that I feel comfortable enough with to open up to like this. I\u2019ve gone through most of my life alone and I\u2019m tired of it, I just want somebody to genuinely spend time with. I just want some advice on how to deal with this.", "subreddit": "lonely"}

The world apparently revolves around themselves because that's just the way humans naturally think. You are the main character of your life so you are special in your own situation.\nIn a way others don't matter then so you can manage to do your own thing not worrying about other peoples chosen paths. It'll just distract you/ slow you down from your own desired plan.\n\nPeople usually expect others to fulfill there loneliness  and misery, but the issue is that if both people always expect the others to make the first move then nothing will ever progress further. You, doing it yourself need to find time to please and satisfy yourself when you're in depth of loneliness. If you always lean on others who do not stand with you or understand common grounds you will be let down and fall while they laugh at your fails. Two people who lean on each other with the same equal balance will not fall. That goes for the same with trust and love, we need an equal balance from both sides for the magic to work effectively. \nJust like trust fall. You have been told to trust them but sometimes, depending on the person, you might be let down while the broken trust is laughed off and not thought of at all, until you may have to use that now broken trust again. Or you may not trust the other person so you hesitate of letting go of fear and not letting trust do its thing, in doing so you have now done what you were scared of at first.

Who knows lol) and I really wish I\u2019d found you all sooner, but then I\u2019m not sure if it\u2019s fair that I post here. While I\u2019m 30 and have been single for a total of 29 years and three months out of that 30 (which would terrify normal people, but not FAs), *I have* been in a relationship before, however short...\n\n**So quick recap:** I unfortunately went to an all girl\u2019s school, which I think kinda screwed me up when it came to instigating or having confidence with guys. I was single for such a long time it became normal. But even though I was happy with my life, I still desired a relationship and was searching damn hard for someone to love. How I used to crave touch!! I think it's the way I show love, so it's been like torture for me, especially these last few years. Sometimes, I felt like I was cursed. How come I'd never had a relationship? Why didn\u2019t anyone love me? What was wrong with me? \n\nMy friends were *always* loved up and most of them are now engaged or married (except one guy friend who is also FA like me), and then there was little solitary me, the single one, the third wheel, the wallflower, the crazy cat lady. Sometimes, I felt like a magnet and every guy I fell for had the same polarity as me. Where was my opposite!?\n\n**In regards to my limited relationship experience:** At the age of 27, I met a guy through mutual friends, but sadly we only dated for 2 months. A year later, when I was 28, I casually dated a guy for 4 /5months. That was the entirety of my relationship experience. 6 months.\n\nBut guess what!! After another two years of being single, I met this guy on Tinder in February this year! (Yes, everyone is like 'wow you met your boyfriend on Tinder??) He is my age and super caring, sweet and funny. He\u2019s studying his master\u2019s degree and works two jobs (I'm concerned he works too much). We went on our first date end of Feb, became official in April and have been dating almost 3 months now. For the first in my in my life, I don\u2019t feel so alone.\n\n**We swapped 'I love yous' last week**. I have never, ever had anyone tell me they love me (besides my parents). He said it first, and even though I felt the same, I found it really hard to say it back and it took me a few weeks to catch up. I\u2019m just not used to all this lovey dovey relationship stuff \u2013 although I must say, I\u2019m enjoying it, but only because it\u2019s him. I'm not sure I could live without his hugs now. Oh God, hugging him is the best, and he loves randomly hugging me, touching my hand, pulling me close when we're watching a movie, rubbing his thumb over mine. I never thought I'd end up with someone who loves touch as much as I do.\n\nBut there\u2019s a caveat to all this... he\u2019s moving back home in August!! \n\nI have no clue why he was on Tinder looking for a serious relationship, yet he was planning on moving home so soon?? Who does that?? Is he playing me? I can\u2019t believe I let myself fall in love for the first time with someone who is moving away. I was just getting used to the idea of being FA, now I'll know what I'm missing. *Because I'll be missing him.*\n\nSo anyway... I\u2019ll probably unsubscribe for now, but I might see you all again come August? However, I promise I'll try my best to give this relationship a good shot so you never have to see me again. (Maybe I can convince him to stay??) But still, I have this weird gut feeling I'm just meant to be alone.", "subreddit": "ForeverAlone"}

I'm talking FA'ers who are 30+ so don't think I mean the 18 year old who thinks it's over for them. I will always tell FA'ers in their late teens to mid 20's to keep trying because you only have one chance being that age. I'm talking about a guy like me. I tried for years and gave up. I still get shamed and told I should keep trying. When I say give up, even giving up for an extended period of time counts. \n\nGoing out to try and meet people costs money. Using dating sites costs money especially if they actually show up and don't flake. Some FA'ers are in their 30's and haven't given up. They still are optimistic and that's good for them. I'm happy for them and don't think even they should give up. If you spend so many resources on trying to escape FA for years and get no results, sometimes giving up is an intelligent move. People think we have an unending supply of self-esteem and financial ability to support our going out or using dating sites. Sometimes the cost becomes too much and it's not feasible to keep trying. \n\nThe problem is, even when giving up, part of you will still want the companionship that you get in relationships. It's a part of you that is missing something natural and needed. We know that. I just can't stand when some 21 year old non-FA'er shames an older FA'er for giving up. They assume you didn't try because if you actually tried using their advice, you would escape FA. \n\nI know I keep posting this but it bothers me that some people just can't let us give up in peace and vent about it. Do you know how difficult it is to accept giving up? I know it's easier to say you have given up while venting. Actually accepting giving up is extremely difficult and it takes a long time to actually do so. Part of me still wants to escape FA. Part of me thinks I will meet her tomorrow but I know I won't. I will never meet her because she doesn't exist. \n\nI know this will probably get downvoted but I don't think there is anything wrong with giving up if you have exhausted all your options but still failed. Some of us are meant to lose. Not everyone can win. Before I fall asleep I've been imagining this woman who I have a relationship with. It's because part of me can't accept giving up. I wish I could change my reality so I still had a chance but I can't. \n\nIt's 2:30AM here. I'm half asleep. I wish I could go to bed with a woman and fall asleep with her. I wish I could do something that is normal for most people. I can't. You may think it's wallowing in self pity and how destructive that type of thinking is. It's my reality and nothing is going to change it.", "subreddit": "ForeverAlone"}

I mentioned how he has worked his tail off all these years and really doesn\u2019t have *that* much to show for it. It wasn\u2019t that blunt, but it\u2019s pretty much what I said. He said every single day he truly feels that something good will come out of it. And even if it isn\u2019t for himself, since he\u2019s up there in age, he has faith that *something* good will happen out of his life whether it\u2019s directly through him or through me. Now I\u2019m (embarrassingly) in my 20s, NEET, never had an SO or anything close(well maybe close. But not close to the average person. See my last post if you care that much), but I have three awesome friends. Three friends that I don\u2019t talk to very much, but they at least know I\u2019m alive. Can\u2019t say that about anyone else besides my parents! Anyways..... \n\nMy dad has had a rougher childhood then I and has survived. It just baffles me how he clings onto hope and faith so much(!!!!!) when he doesn\u2019t have much other than me.. And I\u2019m a huge disappointment. And it\u2019s left me to become just very... stale? Stale on the outside at least. I\u2019m constantly battling inner demons on the inside. I\u2019ve had way better opportunities that he has ever had, yet I\u2019m not even an ounce of the man he is. \n\nSo my question is: how in the world does he do it?! Do you guys have any hope(even the slightest feeling) with things regarding life? I know some of you guys might think to yourself absolutely no way in hell lol. But I genuinely want to know if you guys have any kind of optimism, even if it turns into false hope. I like to think I have hope, but things seem so bleak that it\u2019s hard to see past it. Yet my dad seems so sure on it, so I feel that I should try my hardest to have that outlook too. Anyways, I love my dad and he\u2019s my hero.

I made my first post last time and every time I saw the red little message icons it gave me horrible anxiety. Long live the lurkers!\n\nTL;DR: I love my dad. Do you guys have the slightest amount of hopefulness in you, or is it a \u201cI\u2019ll believe it when I see it\u201d thing?

Well for me, that day is 3/14/13. My parents were drug dealers so they never really kept an eye on me or my siblings so when I was 13, my friends who had a similar background would run amuck in a smallish town in Kentucky. We walked across town to the movie theater pretty often and sometimes we even walked to the local Walmart. Hearing it like that doesn't do any justice so note theres about 5 miles of bypass and highway to either place and we're just a group of 8th graders. On pi day, we had pie in math class, did a lab in science, and overall had a great Friday. Afterschool we were hanging at T's house. T's parents were addicts so he and I got along well because we understood each other. We got another friend, IA, to go with us to go see this liam Neeson movie where he's an air marshal and the plane gets taken hostage and after the movie we walk back to T's house to spend the night. I got hit by a Red jeep while crossing a bypass. I remember being on the ground and getting up to walk towards T, who was mortified. I shattered my left foot. Metatarsals 2-5 broken in 2 places each and metatarsal 1 was at a 45\u00b0 angle. \n\nFast forward a few months.\n\nI had just started highschool and we moved to a nearby town to lower the risk of my parents getting busted. Got my first girlfriend. She was extremely clingy. Things at the new school worked out great for about a year and a half. Feb 5, 2016; my grandma died. My mom was in prison for selling drugs and my dad moved back to the old town, I was living with my sister. I dealt with her passing pretty well for the most part. I spent valentine's day at the funeral and the girlfriend wasn't happy about that at all. Somehow it got miscommunicated to the girlfriend's mother that my sister was selling drugs to feed us so she calls my grieving sister and starts a fight, the sister responded by sending me to live with my father. \n\nA couple weeks pass and I move in with him.\n\nUpon my arrival he tells me that \"you know, you're 15 and you're old enough to take care of yourself so I'll just be here if you absolutely need me\" and he vanishes to go live with his mistress that he eventually leaves my mom for. So 15 year old me gets a full time job at a fast food place nearby and works full time while going to school, my grades suffer, I starve, and eventually become homeless after a couple months because he was already behind on rent.\n\nAfter nearly a week, T asks me why I smell like ass and dumpster and I tell him I've been homeless for a few days and dont have anywhere to go.\n\nI move in with T, and his family, in a house that wasn't exactly the safest of places. I live with T and eventually carry the house by paying the rent and utilities (pretty impressive for 17.) I even got a new girlfriend. I didnt pay the water bill one month and his parents told me I had to leave. Ok whatever. \n\nI'm homeless for 2 days before I bring myself to tell the girlfriend. Her mom calls me and tells me she's coming to pick me up and I'm going to live with them until I turn 18.\n\nGirl tells me in January of 2018 she doesn't love me and wants her ex back. But decides she wont break up with me until graduation so I dont have to be homeless again. She slowly became distant and cold over the next few months and eventually started to hate me. My birthday was 2 weeks after graduation.\nMay 25th, she breaks up with me and I starved myself for 18 days because I was too sad to eat. I didn't sleep much, or do much of anything but cry because I was so hurt. She was apathetic about the whole situation and didn't understand how much I still loved her. I was still working fast food and on my income alone, didnt qualify to live anywhere and the income housing in the town is ridiculously packed. I bought a car for $1500 and didnt know how to drive it, and we kept it parked at her grandmas house because it didnt have tags until I turned 18.\n\nThe day comes.\n\nWe wake up at 0800 and finish packing the rest of my stuff. It was at this point she told me she planned a vacation with the ex and they were going to Tampa Florida for a couple weeks. She and her mom dropped me off at my car and her mom asked me if I had somewhere to go. I told her and old guy was letting me rent his vacation home until I'm on my feet, I didnt want to hurt her moms feelings and didn't want her mom to feel bad because her step dad was the one who ordered that I move out on my birthday. I hugged both of them and that was the last time I saw them. I got in my car and turned the keys in the ignition and said \"if I die, I die\" and then taught myself how to drive by driving all over town to visit people.\n\nI hung out with T and he had told me about plans to go on vacation with his wife and he said he wished I had money and time. I told him I had 5 days off and $1000. We went on vacation up north.\n\nAfter vacation I lived in my car for 2 months. Still hurt about the girl at the time and to this day, still uncomfortable with everything. I moved in with an old coworker for a few months but the conditions were terrible. I wrecked my car shortly after I moved in with them and got a new, better job. \n\nRight around Thanksgiving my mother had finally gotten out of prison and rehab and moved in to income housing with my younger sister. I decided to move in with them and after being there for 3 months. She had 4 strokes one night and went to hospital the a couple days later. When they were loading her into the ambulance, she told me that I had 2 days to find somewhere and move because we were getting evicted. I spent the first day finding a place and managed to pull $1100 out of my ass and thin air and then spent the second day moving in while the sherriffs dept was putting our stuff on the road. We've been here for 3 going on 4 months now and I'm almost 9, carrying a family of 4. \n\nNow the reason I posted this. It's 0300 and I'm sad as shit and I'm just wondering why I had to go through all of that and why it's still so hard. That's not even the full story. I'm sad because since that girl I havent even met anyone new because I'm terrified of getting close to anyone.

In the later stages people with the illness may compulsively put objects in their mouths.\n* Decreased amount of speech or repetitive speech\n* Often the person will be unaware of the true extent of the problems and lack insight.\n\nAs soon as I started looking into FTD and saw those symptoms, I got a cold chill down my spine. Ive not been officially diagnosed with FTD but having had several CT scans within the past 4 months showing dead brain tissue in the frontal lobe of my brain I decided to schedule to have more thorough testing done ASAP. The fact that the Dr in the 60 minutes piece said dementia in people who are in their 30's is almost always FTD and it is fatal 100% within years due to how fast it progresses has me sitting here pondering what the hell happens to me as a 37-year-old with no friends or family to support me. If I do have FTD, it wont be long before Im in an assisted living home like the 40-year-old in the 60 minutes piece. He at least had a wife who visited him.  I just so happened to have worked in an assisted living home before and that alone scares the living hell out of me. thats not how I want to be living until I die. I am really struggling with this. Thought about posting in the dementia sub or some other one but I have a feeling that they wouldnt be able to help since there'd be a lot of \"get help from friends and family\" for which I dont have.", "subreddit": "ForeverAlone"}

I see it all the time: \"small chance but, slim chance you'll see this but, and sometimes just too shy to say anything,\" types.

Tell myself I hadn't really gone out much. Read some of the posts not related to me. Wonder if any these wackos are being flagged on a constant basis or not. Leave CL. \n\nThis time I did that, but thought, \"I have to add this insert about my exuberant work acquaintance I adore and want to entertain outside of work. She isn't posting anything, so I will do it. \n\nShe has since made her face a little shorter and increased her general distance from me.

I realize due to my position that I may not have gone about this relationship in the right  way and have since decided to remove it. \n\nI'm very hopeful that my work acquaintance will return to her normal self with a CL 'Long-shot' hopefully.", "subreddit": "ForeverAlone"}

I'll admit that I was very depressed in high school, and I thought that once I graduated, everything in my life would be made right. I graduated from high school less than a year ago, and I started college last fall. The friends that I had in high school usually left me out of things, but I was at least grateful to talk to people every day. I never hung out with friends over the weekends or after school or during breaks because I always felt like no one ever really wanted me there. I left high school on good terms with all of my friends, and we follow each other on social media. The problem with that is that every time I see a post or a snap from them, they're always hanging out with friends (from high school or with new ones) and I never am. I'm extremely shy and introverted, so I haven't made a single friend in college. My roommate tried to be friends with me for about a month until she gave up due to my short answers and general quietness. I just can't help it. I wish more than anything else that I wasn't so socially anxious and that I could be outgoing. I feel so lonely. I don't have a single friend, and I'm 18 years old, which should be a time that I'm trying new things, but I just can't out of fear. I'm at home for the summer now, and somehow it feels even more depressing that I'm at home and still no one wants to spend time with me. I fear that my life is always going to be like this, but taking the first steps to get to know people feels so impossible.

(RANT)", "author": "WreckedCosmonaut", "self_text": "So, I'm 21 now and I honestly feel for the past 3 years I've done nothing. I've taken a back seat in my own life and I essentially just sit there and comment negatively on myself. I still think about every mean thing that someone said to me in secondary school and its pathetic, I just beat myself up and then beat myself up for feeling negative. I fantasize about saying the right thing or having an amazing comeback to something said to me when I was 14 or something. The worst part is it feels like I can't help it, that these thoughts will always exist and closure is almost scary. Its like there's a very powerful part of me that likes being this way and its winning every time. I've always been interested in psychology but I don't think its really helped, I can put names and labels to behaviors and emotions but this awareness has done little in actually changing my attitude. Its been a long time since I've enjoyed something, or made a good memory. I understand that by reacting to these thoughts i'm feeding the ego but I keep slipping back into old ways, I will act how I normally do and my therapist and others around me say that i'm not taking care of myself. I honestly don't know how else to be. I feel that mentally I am still the same as I was when I was a child, the same issues persist and plague me and change is just not an option. There are days where I wake up fine, filled with confidence and the next i'm back to my old self with no rhyme or reason to it. Ok, got a bit side tracked there and this is a loneliness post. In school I had a good group of friends, guys who were on my level, we got along great and had similar interests I could be myself around them. But I held a deep insecurity that I think was plain to see. I never felt \"cool\" in myself, I was awkward and painfully shy. Always wanting more and taking my friends for granted. My lack of confidence really affected my social skills, I was terrified of other people. Whenever possible I would spend my time in-front of the TV playing video games. I could play it for hours, in my own world where I was in control. No one could hurt me or saying anything mean. I feel I should mention that ever since I was a kid I've been extremely sensitive, anything said to me I would take it to heart and the physical sensation was torturous. I hoped that I would not care about these things and I would develop thick skin, but it never really happened. I built my life around protecting myself. I was a yes man to anyone who was mean to me, I would be nice to people even if they treated me like shit, even when I fought back either physically or verbally it just led to more ridicule . I put everyone above myself if it meant being safe. But try as I might I couldn't control everyone, there were cracks in the defense, so I tried to change myself as much as physically possible becoming extremely self-conscious of my looks, this was most prevalent during my teenage years and has lessened now. But that idea of protection has never gone away, I come home from work or college and sit in my room, still playing video games or just browsing the internet and i'm gradually slipping away from my friends. I've almost convinced myself that I don't need them, and that they're actually bad people and I don't need them. But Jesus Christ, I need someone. I just want to be part of something, to belong to a group and experience the world together and i'm afraid that I will never allow myself to get there.", "subreddit": "lonely"}

I do have some senior friends but the thing is that we are always busy and there is going to be a good chance that we might disconnected since college is right around the corner. I used to liked this girl and luckily enough liked me back but she is also a senior and we both have to end it because she said she wasnt ready for a relationship plus she will have to cut everyone off because she doesnt want highschool memories to get her held back due to the fact the she actually enjoys my school. Im 18 and im one year older than everyone because i got held back due to a nasty elementary school teacher.

But back of my head im saying that its easier for them to say be independent when they already have friends. I just fear that after college if i dont have my stuff settle in and i dont make friends than what else am i going to do.

At school i was considered ugly (was extremely skinny) and some children bullied me, so a relationship was out of the question. In college, the scars were still fresh but even so i gradually put up more weight and entered normal levels.\n\n Since i was scarred, approaching women seemed fucking terrifying. I was in constant fear that they will mock me or pompously ignore me. Whatever \"be confident\" advices were useless. How can i be confident if i never had a success story with a woman? If i attempted to do that it would be extremely awkward (seen it happening a lot with other guys....)\n\n It was actually women approaching me, directly or indirectly, that built my confidence. Glances, extending the conversation with me, laughing with my terrible jokes, asking about me etc. Turns out that while i wouldnt say that im conventionally attractive, i have some traits that lure certain tastes.\n\n What i want to conclude? That i can totally empathize when i see posts here mocking people who urge FAers to be confident. Its literally impossible to happen without experience. It comes naturally after you get some validation from women but i consider it impossible to fake it without making yourself seem like a fool.", "subreddit": "ForeverAlone"}

It has always been an extrovert noticing me and taking me under their wing. I just followed them around wherever they went and did whatever activity they wanted to do and tbh it really didnt bother me at all when i was young. I lead a sort of double life where i had \u201cfriends\u201d in school and totally alone and lonely at home and then an incident happened which completely turned my life upside down. It took me quite a while to realise a lot of things i thought then were quite normal and happened to everybody. Didnt have the internet like today to figure it out by myself in time. Now i feel i am too deep in it and in such a downward spiral that i dont think i can get out of it.  \n\nNow that I'm older making friends is even harder. I can't seem to make friends at uni. I doubt they even notice me. Never gets invited to any events. Quite figuratively a wallflower.\n\n\nMaybe my struggle to make friends is due to my inability to make small talks. I hate small talk so much. Now I understand that you can't go up to a complete stranger and interact like youve known them since you were born. But if the deepest conversation you've had with a person you've known for a few months is how unseasoned the pasta was and how they fixed it with a pinch of salt, then it gets exhausting. \n\nI want to have deep meaning conversations or debates about things we understand or don't understand. Talk about improbables, possibilities, potentials. Have deep conversations about space, universe, astronomy, science, music, movies, theories, conspiracies, sports, life, science, dreams, the future, the past, sex or whatever . I don't care if there are disagreements. I just want passionate, honest exchanges where I feel alive and stimulated and not dead nor on a ventilator nor autopilot. \n\nBut then I need atleast a few things in common. It's so hard to find people you relate to. Once in a while I come across posts here where it initially seems like I might relate with the OP but after a few messages, it daunts on me that we have nothing in common at all. Even this post half of you might think \u201cwhat a twat bragging about how he had friends in the past\" and the other half might sympathise with me. And a handful of people of the latter would message me and one week later it's all quiet again. Don't even get me started about people who ghost. Either grow a spine and tell them it's not working out or let the conversation die out. Don't leave someone hanging for a response you weasels. Imagine if that happened to you in real life face to face. Not very nice is it? \n\nWhat I mean is I am tired of being alone, or lonely when I'm around people, not having people I'd genuinely like to call friends. And I have absolutely no hope of ever finding a partner and I'm fucking tired of feeling like an outsider and that I don't belong here. I'm also tired of slowly starting to hate people out of jealousy or envy and having what I don't have or understand but I still want them because it seems to make them happy. \n\nSo that's it from me I guess.

I post here because loneliness is admittedly a major part of my problems, yet I don\u2019t think, at this point at least, that I would ever consider suicide, so r/suicidewatch is out of the question. I just feel...empty. Like I\u2019m trying too hard to be something I\u2019m not. Like everything I know is bullshit. Constantly switching between an optimistic and pessimistic perspective is becoming very tiresome. \nToday was just a normal day. Nothing special really. Every day for the past 17 years has not been anything special. It\u2019s all routine. I wouldn\u2019t say my circumstances are bad in any way, but again, it\u2019s all about standards and perspectives. I\u2019ve always been the quiet kid. Always having nothing to say, being complimented on my \u2018intelligence\u2019, seemingly having no outside emotions. Lately I\u2019ve been trying to be more outgoing though. This year especially. And this year has been a hell of a roller coaster. My grades, for the first time in all my school years, have started slipping. Great. I can\u2019t force myself to do the book work, and when I tried, I couldn\u2019t understand any of it... My friend tells me I\u2019m still a living robot even though I thought I\u2019ve improved. I suppose not. I just want a fresh start to change my personality.\nI wanna talk about the loneliness specifically now. I had my first girlfriend this year. That was a disaster. I think I only dated her because I was desperate at that point. I would never reach out to anyone and didn\u2019t have any female friends up to that point. It got too serious too fast and I realized I did not want to date her anymore. Cut it off quickly after I realized. Now I have a crush on this other girl in my class. I might as well bury that deeper than the Mariana Trench because I fucked up any chance i might\u2019ve had with her. Here\u2019s what happened: I tell my friend who I have a crush on (who, by the way, I\u2019ve literally never talked to before; I\u2019ve just seen her in class and thought she was really cute), he says he\u2019ll try to talk to her and bring it up sometime. That wasn\u2019t good enough for me. I told him to tell her NOW that I liked her. Yea, real smart. I\u2019m not sure why he listened to me. Looking back at this now makes me wanna kill myself (well yes, but actually no) because I now realize that this girl got a text from her friend saying \u201cblahblahblah likes you.\u201d You know what she says? \u201cWho?\u201d He told me her response and that\u2019s when I realized I fucked up. But wait, it gets better. He tells her to at least talk to me before she makes a decision. So she adds me on Snapchat. (Commence most awkward conversation in the history of awkward conversations.) I still stand by the fact that she was the one that made it super awkward though. She didn\u2019t reply for hours, possibly days at a time. When she did reply, it always a one word response like ok or idk. I really wish she could\u2019ve just told me to stop talking to her or something. I cut off the conversation because I knew she wanted nothing to do with it, and proceeded beat myself up over how much of an absolute retard I was in this whole situation. All I wanted was to get to know her better. Possibly make a new friend. Possibly something more. Now I can\u2019t even look her in the eye.  I give up trying for girls right now. As long as she\u2019s still in my mind.\nI\u2019ve got no solid plan for what I want to do out of high school. Everyone in my classes knows what college they\u2019re going to and what they\u2019re studying for. \nI don\u2019t like the idea of going to college. I really don\u2019t. Depending on what I decide to do, that would be at least 4 more years of my life gone die to schooling. Also unless I get hella scholarships (which isn\u2019t too promising considering my grades this year) is have to take a student loan and be in debt for the rest of my life. Yea, I\u2019d rather not. Anything I thought of though that I wanted to do requires college. Computers? College. Aviation? College. \nThis will be the end of entry #2 of \u2018random person\u2019s rant on life \u2018. I\u2019ll probably be back sooner than I hope. But for now I have to get at least an hour of sleep before school. Still know it\u2019s not gonna happen but I might as well try.

I had asked her out before she said no so I had pretty much given up all hope so this was a jolt of happiness out if nowhere. We started dating. Since we had decided to see how things work out before telling our friends we couldn't hold hands in class. We anyways sat together but then we started locking our legs underneath the bench as a show of discrete intimacy in class. First time in my life did I actually feel butterflies in my stomach. Then we made plans to go for a movie in the weekend.\n\nAnd then came reality. She realised the 'like' liking she felt was a sudden impulse and was not really a permanent feeling. We worked shit out and ended it then and there after a good three days though we are still best friends. \n\nProbably the only three days in my last one and a half years of my life where I felt happy without feeling guilty afterwards ( the course I'm going through requires you to study atleast 7 hours everyday excluding an 8 hour class so partaking in any form of entertainment left me with a pang of guilt for not studying).\n\nI respected her decision. It went a long way in maintaining our friendship and I completely understand what she must have felt. I do not blame/hate her one bit. \n\nBut fucking hell don't I miss it. The mere thought of holding her hands in the coming days used to make me so fucking happy. It was a very welcome stress-relief given I am pissed off almost 24/7.

I'm 45, no physical contact with the opposite sex, ignored, ridiculed, despised - the usual. And I'm not surprised, because I felt like I was never in the game, fated to watch. Cut off. Others have always been a million miles away, incomprehensible, unreachable. I know, deep down, I'm no different to them. I'm nothing special. And yet, their ability to attract, seduce, pair off - it's like strange insect behaviour to me. And I knew this, absolutely, with complete certainty. That this world was denied to me, as soon as my desire began, to want to join and love and be loved, just touch, to hold and be held. That this was impossible. This life has been a torment. I alternated between self-hatred and hating the source of the pain, the occasion for its existence. Now it's just ashes. I can watch any amount of porn and nothing, I used to envy them. Films that reduced me to tears I can yawn my way through them. It took me a long time, but I finally understood: some things are just givens, like the characteristics of chemical elements. And I'm loathsome, inert, undesirable, unlovable. Knowing my fate, knowing my nature, but refusing to accept it has caused me so much pain. Some things you just know about yourself, and from an early age. It's not anything you can prove, but it doesn't make it any less true. And trying to wish it away, blotting it out, just adds to the damage. So my advice, for what it's worth, is: It's better to think of yourself as a member of a different species. Then it all begins to make a horrible kind of sense. Spare yourself years of heartache. There was never any hope, you know this, have always known this. And give up this idea that \"if they knew the real me, then...\" You are seen and you are known. They're not rejecting you despite what you're \"really\" like. They're rejecting you because of precisely who and what you're really like. Because there is something wrong with you. You think all those people in relationships had to read books, plot out their seductions? When you're normal things just kind-of fall into place, as a matter of course. These things are not for you. The sooner you accept - not play-acting and pretending, but still secretly hoping, I mean really accept- the less pain there'll be. Or at least, not this particular source of pain, the pain of false hope. I'm sorry, sorry for you, for me, for all of us.

After work she texted me a little bit and then ghosted me. She was the only person i talked to outside of work who i thought actually cared in about 2 months.  So she probably felt bad for me and wanted to talk long enough just to make sure i wasnt going to kill myself.

Of course, marriage and as well as the single life have their rough times. In both cases we have to jump over big hurdles, but being together with your partner, especially a loving and supportive partner can bring in more comfort, as well as more confidence and self-assurance.\n\nWhy? Because in a relationship (ideally speaking) there would be someone who can be there for you in your tough times, be it just by cuddling, show affection or saying very sweet words for you or even cooking or getting a present for you (yeah, I am a male and well, I do believe in the traditional roles, that men bring in the bread and women keep the family healthy and stable, but of course there are exceptions role reversal and all that jazz, which I accept and am not strictly against it, since I do believe that women can be great leaders and thinkers and workers. Maybe not work, manual labor is just meh, I don't like it haha, so I wouldn't want my partner to do manual labor but if she wants to it is alright, just as long as it is a good workplace). At the end of the day there is someone who cares for you, who gives and show you love, who also receives love and appreciate your efforts to give and show her your love. Your partner can also be your best critique, best feedback source.\n\nBut living alone, you pretty much have to rely on yourself all the time. You have to pick yourself up from the grounds when you have been knocked down. You have to work up your courage by yourself or in one of those workshops when it is down again. You have to talk your confidence back to yourself when it is low again. Especially, the confidence. If there is noone, no \"loving\" partner, who supports you, building up confidence can be really really difficult in the first place. Amazingly enough, even the slightest confirmation from the opposite sex makes us fly high, at least for me, no matter how hard I try to not let myself go like that lol, especially if it comes from someone who I could potentially marry/be-together-with.\n\nTL;DR Ideally speaking, in a relationship you have someone who can comfort you and raise your confidence. Living alone, you have to basically do that to yourself with hard work and unfortunately lots of (positive) thinking, which can be really difficult to do so.", "subreddit": "ForeverAlone"}

I don\u2019t expect anyone to sit and read this as I\u2019m doing it mostly for myself. \n\u2014\u2014\u2014\nI am known to be a very quiet person. I keep a lot of things to myself. It\u2019s mostly unpopular opinion shit. For instance, my friends don\u2019t know I\u2019m into nightcore music. They\u2019ve said straight up that they don\u2019t understand why people would like it, and I know they\u2019re the type of people that would judge me for liking it. Another thing is anime. They know I like anime, but not to the extent that I do. There is one secret I have though that I won\u2019t even share here. I WILL take it to the grave. Society just isn\u2019t accepting of it and that\u2019s ok with me. I want to open up to people, i really do, i just don\u2019t know how to go about it. I don\u2019t want to be the person that makes everything about themselves and i don\u2019t want to over share and make it awkward. \n\u2014\u2014\u2014\nAm I selfish? I analyze my own personality constantly. I feel like my every move is being judged, mostly by me. A lot of times I catch myself bragging about Rubik\u2019s cubes or coding or whatever it is at the time, and try to shut the fuck up before they completely lose interest in talking to me. I feel as if I just want their attention. The validation of my classmates or even strangers, hoping they might become my friends.\nEven one of my only friends says I was a jerk to him before he got to know me. I don\u2019t try to be... I assume part of this is my confidence. I have a hard shell when it comes to showing my emotions in public. People say I always look sad or angry. I do admit though that I have a problem with authority. When someone tries to treat me unfairly, even the smallest things, I hold a grudge and suddenly it becomes an eye for an eye. I know, it\u2019s petty. I\u2019m working on that. \n\u2014\u2014\u2014\nI wanna talk about dreams and aspirations.\nWhat is my ideal world? Living stress free with a loving girlfriend/wife in a virtual world such as SAO, passing time doing video game stuff or exploring the vastness of the realm. \nWhat are my realistic ideals from this point in time? Finishing high school with good grades and being able to get a good paying job with the least amount of education as possible (I want to be an ATC). Also while being in a romantic relationship. (I still can\u2019t get the girl i mentioned in my previous post out of my head). I want to have enough free time and money to be able to ride a motorcycle alongside my brother and play video games and do fun things with friends. \nNow that was the optimistic point of view; let\u2019s see what\u2019s in the dark portions of my mind right now: Well the way I see it, I\u2019m not gonna be good enough to get a job, let alone one I enjoy, all my 1 friends are going leave me because I\u2019m a jerk who only thinks about himself, I\u2019ll never have a romantic, long-lasting relationship, and I\u2019ll end up committing suicide in the middle of Butt-fuck Nowhere, United States, where no one will ever give a thought to who I was ever again. \nOk... let\u2019s meet somewhere in the middle: What is realistically going to happen? I will finish high school with decent grades. I\u2019ll probably be going to college majoring in computer science. I still won\u2019t have a girlfriend and will be just as lonely as I am now. I won\u2019t have the free time to do what i enjoy while I\u2019m in college but somehow I\u2019ll find a way to blow off my work to play video games or something. That\u2019s as far as I can see right now, and it doesn\u2019t sound that appealing to me. You know what I really want to do right now? Just walk. I just want to walk. Miles away possibly. Enjoy nature, rest peacefully on a hillside and listen to music. Just... take a break from everything. But life goes on. And while that happens i am trapped in this routine. This life that I feel I have barely any control over. \n\u2014\u2014\u2014\nThis concludes \u201crandom person\u2019s rant on life\u201d entry #3. I find this to be very therapeutic, thought provoking, and I do love reading people\u2019s replies to it, good or bad. I am definitely going to write some more random shit tomorrow.

I'm 26 years old and have never been loved. I have never had difficulty making friends, but since I'm an introvert, I tend to be highly selective about the kind of company I keep. I have a few female friends who keep reassuring me that I'm the most amazing guy ever and any girl would be lucky to have me, but reality strongly suggests otherwise.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI also happen to be quite self-aware. I know what my strengths and weaknesses are. I'm nowhere close to being an \"amazing guy\" in any sense of the word, but I've seen much less interesting guys with basic personalities find attractive women who love them. But not me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThere's only been a few girls I've ever been romantically interested in, but none of them ever felt the same for me. I went out with a girl this Sunday who asked me out on Tinder and seemed reasonably interested in me before we actually did meet. The date went okay, but it was cut short because her mom apparently has anxiety, so she had to rush to her. But she did say she liked meeting me before leaving. She was probably being nice, because she hasn't been the same on texts since then and it's clear she's trying to ghost me. Obviously, I backed off as soon as I got the hint and I don't expect to hear back from her.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIsn't it curious that two individuals can feel so differently about an interaction that only they are a part of? I thought the date went well. Though it was a little too short to allow for sufficient sample size for analysis, it didn't seem like she was bored or uncomfortable at all. Or maybe I'm really dumb too.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, I wonder, what is it that makes me so unlovable? Perhaps it's my social anxiety. Or my face. Or my voice. Or all three. I can't really be sure. Sometimes I feel there's just some intangible aspect in an individual's personality, an X-factor of sorts, that makes a person likable and the lack of that factor has the opposite effect on people.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI think the worst part of this is not the fact that I've never been loved, but how inadequate this makes me feel.

If you don't mind (hey I am not going to force you to approach someone if they've got a knife in their hands of some shit), just talk first, alright? Cause that shit? That simple shit, of just saying the first word, asking the first question?\n\nIt feels like walking across the columns of the Golden Gate bridge on string fucking wire for dumb shits like myself.\n\nSo ya, next time you tell yourself nobody could envy you, remember that at least my dumb ass envies you. Not that this kind of stuff ever helps when you tell yourself that, but hey. I'd sell my soul to the fucking devil for this shit honestly. Well maybe not, you can do a lot more with a deal with the devil, but hey.\n\nDon't take this shitpost too much to heart. Alright?\n\nIt's a boring fucking evening.", "subreddit": "lonely"}

It helps me to break the daily routine that keeps you normally in its grip. I got a few days off of work und decided to go to Budapest since I didn't know the city and and it's just about an hour away by plane.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt was a rainy day, so I skipped walking around and went to the Sz\u00e9chenyi bath. There I see a girl I was immediately drawn to. She had these bright blue, fascinating eyes. After about half an hour of unsecure looks, I brought up the courage, first time in my life, to speak to her, a complete stranger. Not knowing what to say I babbled something, bit of conversation came out of it. I got scared, wished her a nice day and drew back. She stayed there, I got back to my place, about 10 metres away. After a few minutes I knew I want to try again and went back to her. We talked, simple questions from 'where do you come from' to 'what are you doing in Budapest'. She was a bit hesitant and not super confident at conversation, but it felt comfortable. Like myself, Maria (25) travelled alone, came to Europe to visit a few cites and will then be going back to work to Siberia (Russia). After some time, we run out of stuff to talk about, so we decided to go to dinner at night. Meeting point and time were set.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThat night we met at the agreed meeting point and went to an Italian restaurant a few streets away. The food was average, but it felt good to have someone to talk to. We shared a lot of common interest, from an economical background in our studies to sports activities and the current jobs we have. After diner we walked back to the tram station. Not entirely sure how to proceed, because she was planning to travel to Prague the next day, I proposed vaguely to go for a drink in the inner city. She agreed, we boarded the tram and went there. The night before I had come across a street with some cool bars, so we intented to go there. From the tram station to the our destination we walked through a pretty shady area, I could feel she wasn't 100% confortable. Luckily we found the nightlife area a few minutes later.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThere were different bars and other staff, among them a arcade hall where we played a game of air hockey. Soon after we settled in a bar and got a drink. In the following two hours we just talked. Something changed. It was that kind of talk where you really see the other person, where you start to form a bond. What stood out to me was her kindness. There are people that don't really fit in. They lack the presence that people are drawn to, have more problems to articulate themselves, don't put themselves in the spotlight or are just sensitive and therefore are left aside. She experienced these things and that weighted on her. As a result I sensed selflessness, empathy towards other people's troubles and an emotional maturity I admire. It did make me feel both happy and sad. I hope I gonna be that kind of person one day.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAt about 1 a.m. in the morning we walked back to the station. In my mind I knew she was gonna travel to Prague tomorrow morning and we lived different lives at different places. At the station a drunk guy began talking to us. He wasn't threatening in any way, but I got the feeling we lost some of our last minutes together. The tram arrived, we hugged, said our goodbyes, she looked back as she walked in and then was gone.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe have no contact info of each other. I did some rash Facebook search, no success, but I'm ok with that. What I regret is that I didn't told her that the evening meant a lot to me and that she is a great person. I think she needed that and I did too. It is hurtful to see kind people struggle in life. I just hope she will find her way.", "subreddit": "lonely"}

I don't have any friends and would say I'm pretty much undateable, but I'm more or less okay with that. I don't relate/mix well with others. I just try to focus on my university work. Classes are done for the semester, I just have a bunch of exams to study for.\n\nThe library is usually my place of choice (I'm not able to study well in my room for some reason.) However if others talk in the library I get thrown off. Even a small noise makes me lose my focus. And with it being exam week the library is full. People talk in there a lot.\n\nSo weirdly... I'm actually able to study better in the public areas like near the cafes and common areas and such. The stream of background noise is constant and expected, so I'm not thrown off.\n\nSo I arrive at a large empty table at 9am. It's meant for studying, it has electrical outlets and lighting. I begin to study and over the next hour gradually the table gets filled up by a group of girls who I realise are all friends with each other, studying the same subject. They were preparing for exams as a group and helping each other with their work.\n\nEvery now and then, the girls would take breaks and just talk and joke about all sorts of things. Their fun experiences, their boyfriends, that time this happened on that trip to a foreign country. A couple of them talked about their current problems, the others would give advice.\n\nStrangely, it was a very pleasant experience. All of them were nice charming people. I was able to study no problem while listening to these conversations. There was  no interaction between us whatsoever. I did not acknowledge their existence and vice versa, I just listened. That day I went home at around 7pm.\n\nThe next day, I chose the exact same spot to sit. And the same girls came and sat down. Again, it felt great listening to them all talk. I was getting to know them better. They had hilarious conversations on things such as argument techniques to use on their boyfriends. They also tried to rank their professors in order of who they would want to sleep with the most if they had no choice. Then one would complain that they should be studying now. And so on. Despite me not speaking at all, I felt like I was part of the conversation, even though of course I wasn't lol. I was just a fly on the wall. There was no pressure on me to  speak, so I suppose I felt at ease And again, I was actually able to study really well!\n\nAt the end of the second day around 8pm one of the girls said that they should choose somewhere else to sit tomorrow for a change of scenery (paranoid me says that perhaps she suggested this because silent me sitting there creeped her out lol)\n\nOver the course of the two days, I briefly thought about ways I could potentially interject in their talk, say something. But it was not the time. I really don't want to fail these exams! And me and social situations are no good. I had nothing I particularly wanted to say to them either.\n\nBut it was such fun to listen to! I spent around 18 hours with these  people. It felt like I was part of a group of friends, a cool little experience that I won't forget!", "subreddit": "ForeverAlone"}

These have been girls that have done nothing but indulge in toxic behaviors romantically and never sought out help.\n\nThe only longtime relationship I had (2 yrs) was with the girl I thought I'd marry. She's suspected BPD but never got herself checked. Refused therapy until after we broke up (Assuming she didn't lie to me). She blamed me for the deterioration of our relationship when she had numerous communication/confrontation issues from a past of abuse and trauma from parental figures and romantic partners (spare me, according to her.) People tell me I did everything right and was a good boyfriend, but in her eyes I wasn't good enough, as she left me (and most likely cheated) on me with another partner. Then told me two days after we broke up, after two years together, that \"It's as if nothing in my life has changed.\"\n\nSince then I decided to try casual sex. Never thought it'd be my thing, but honestly it's the only thing keeping my confidence up after the betrayal of what she did. I've slept with four girls in the six months we've been broken up, mostly in the last three. Only two of which I'm continually seeing on a fwb basis. Those are the only two that didn't end up crazy. So out of the six relationships (of any sort) I've had with women, only two have been with healthy-minded ones. Those two have honestly treated me better than any of my past romantic partners. One in particular has made it clear she wants no relationship, but almost treats me as if she does. She's built my confidence more than any other girl has, and I hate to say it, I think our \"relationship\" has been my healthiest.\n\nYet I'm incredibly beaten down mentally by that realization. I'm an attractive enough guy clearly, but I feel incredibly worthless that the only ones who HAVE wanted a relationship with me have had horrible codependency issues among many others. I'm enjoying casual sex right now, but I really want to love someone deeply again and feel the same in return.\n\nI feel as if I'm incapable of being loved by someone without mental health issues.

It gets worse when you realize most of your bullies are successful as adults. You are FA while they have a normal life with friends, long term relationships, and kids.

But they don\u2019t really care. \n\nPeople are so rude to me all the time, for some reason people think that insulting people especially the ones that are nice to you and not the people who don\u2019t care about you is the best way to go about things. \n\nI\u2019m always there for people but no one is there for me, no one cares or asks me how I\u2019m doing like I do for them. No one even cares about anything related to me. I just wish all this effort I put into friendships wasn\u2019t so one sided. Or least be nice to me instead of being an asshole just because you\u2019re having a bad day. \n\nI just want one person to ask me how my weekend was first. One person to ask me to hang out first. One person to smile at me in the hallway instead of me smiling and saying hi at someone else and they awkwardly brush past me and mumble a hi back. I want someone to text me first, I want someone to seem happy and not just plain when talking to me.\n\nI sometimes watch other people talk to each other and I get so jealous because they seem so genuine to each other and everything looks mutual. \n\nI\u2019ve struggled with fluctuations of my mental health a lot and I think I\u2019m hitting that low point again. \n\nUsually it goes like this: Sad&gt;go online&gt; talk to people about it&gt;face the world with a positive outlook and don\u2019t give up&gt;get sad again because I realize I\u2019m still alone rinse and repeat.\n\nI hope I start to feel better again because this is honestly pathetic.\n\nWith the people who I talk to at school I\u2019ve been positive non judgmental and open.  But I\u2019m only someone\u2019s emotional toilet at best. No one cares how I feel people think that I don\u2019t have emotions.\n\nPeople think I\u2019m stupid, they treat me like a dog, no one has any respect for me, and I\u2019m constantly being insulted and belittled by my \u2018friends\u2019. \n\nHonestly I give up.\n\nI don\u2019t think it\u2019s my fault anymore, I\u2019ve tried my best and this is where it got me so I quit.", "subreddit": "lonely"}

No one important because of how many of is these are.\n\nWell I am incredibly lonely and it has been getting worse this year. For background: I have autism and social anxiety, which is probably the reason for loneliness.\n\nWell I am 22 years of age and graduated college. I made a few friends during my time there but eventually we all moved on, and my final semester I had literally no friends there. This put a toll on my mental health so bad, I felt so alone and unable to function. In midmarch I had a full on depression episode because of it; still able to go to class and get food but I laid in bed and cried for hours on end.\n\nWhat doesn't help is me questioning my sexuality as well. Since high school I always identified as an aromantic asexual, since being in a relationship and having sex never appealed to me or crossed my mind. Well this year the aromantic part has been gone as I now feel romantic interests in people. Later I started to crave sex, but not with anyone specific. I never felt straight, but now I think I might be. But I never learned how to get a relationship and that lack of romantic feeling has made me feel way worse and lonlier too.\n\n\nWell I am now job hunting and trying to get out more. Maybe a change of scenery and a new change of schedule will help me out. But as of now I am alone and in need of friends.\n\nMy messages and DMs are open for anyone else feeling lonely and in need of friends.\n\nI hope you guys have a great week", "subreddit": "lonely"}

The only female friends I have are those that I had before all of these weird emotional issues started to develop (2-3 years ago), and I just don't worry about it around them, like we can be in all kinds of weird situations and places that would definitely be weird and uncomfortable with a recent friend (like within the past year or so) and it's just no problem.   \n\n\nA really prime example is that I went to Dairy Queen with a close friend of mine (We became friends the first day of high school) and us sitting there in the busy DQ eating ice cream looked kind of like a date.  With most friends that would have driven me absolutely mad, I mean completely Overlook Hotel nuts, but it was no issue, actually it was really fun.  I don't get to hang out with friends often so when we did this it was really great, and honestly I'd like to do it again sometime soon.  It's the same with my other friends too, like for example around the same time my other friend, we'll call her G.  G and I had scheduled an interview for an internship together at a museum on the other side of town from me, and she lived about halfway between (but a little out of the way).  I picked her up and we hung out the whole day, even visiting my old elementary and middle school (I used to live over there but moved after my parent's divorced and Dad passed away), and at the end of the day I dropped her off and all was well, really well.  Not a single issue that whole day.  While on the other end of the spectrum, girls I'm friends/friendly with who I started being friends with after my emotional problems started just make me uncomfortable to even really be alone with in any sense, and would never offer to hang out one of one with them or spend an entire day with them.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nReading this over I realize that it doesn't really fit into the whole theme of the sub, I just wanted to share this kind of weird problem I have and see if I'm all alone in this or if someone relates.", "subreddit": "lonely"}

Whether it be teachers, other students, or even your parents -- within a *decade* of your life (or more) you've been told the same things.\n\n\n\n\"Oh, *you're* not good enough for that. You're too ugly. You're too short. You're too &lt;adjective&gt;. You have no talent.\"\n\n\n\nThese thoughts that begin to accumulate are **not** our own. They're manifestations of echos from the people around you. I suppose it could be an extension of the \"nurture vs. nature\" idea, except the fact that everyone around you wants you dead. \n\n\n\nNo way around it -- the bullies in your life **wanted** you to off yourself. Why else would they have said or done such horrible things to you? You overcame them, and I don't mean for this to be a motivational thing - but you did. It's true you might not have gotten the payback you wanted, but the *biggest* \"fuck you\" you could give them is simply continuing to exist despite the teachers allowing all the bullying to happen. \n\n\n\n\nIn that same breath, though -- you've overcame the bullshit that's known as the \"school penitentiary system.\" Now that you're out in the world as a grown ass adult, what now? You're going to carry what they said to you around for the **rest of your life.** Why? Because people like us *don't* get someone else that completes them. \n\n\n\nSomeone else to come along and explain to you that the things these bullies said were wrong. Why would she say that anyway? Were all those people wrong, and this singular random stranger that comes along later in life is right? That sounds delusional. \n\n\n\n\n\nWe don't get our happy endings, and closure will almost never be something that comes for us.

I picked on kids because that's what got me a singular friend that I thought was \"cool.\" I judged people **SEVERELY** based on looks, how they talk or act, the whole nine yards. Not to say I still don't because it's such a hard thing to break (plus, it didn't help that every kid and their mother did it to me when I was growing up so I began to think it was okay to do), but even at one point I would've considered myself to be a Satanist. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nTimes change, but I'll never forgive myself for the way I was.\n\n\n\n\n\n... Maybe this life I live today is just payback for how I used to treat people. Maybe I *wasn't* supposed to act out after getting kicked for the tenth time in gym, coaches practicing their best Stevie Wonder impressions, blind to the fact that they literally **just** watched me get pushed to the floor. They didn't give a fuck about me, why should *I* for other people? \n\n\n\n\n**TL;DR**: ...

Someone made a post in that thread about how a guy on another sub admitted to being a bully as a kid. He was forgiven and praised for admitting to it as an adult. That's how it goes for FA'ers. The people who made our lives hell and destroyed out self-esteem are forgiven, and have mostly normal lives. Those same people see the victims of their bullying and insult them. Obviously the bullies who admit to being bullies on other subs aren't the same bullies who bullied some of us, but I'm sure it's the same for most of our bullies. They get praised. We get called neckbeards and incels, even if we aren't one of them. They tell us we aren't entitled to anything. I'm not saying we are but it's funny how they are entitled to forgiveness while if one of the people they bullied end up being FA, they are the ones who are insulted. Sometimes the same people who destroyed people's childhoods are the same ones who are telling them to stop wallowing in self-pity. It's like a bully throwing you into a lake, then telling you to stop being wet.\n\nSorry for the vent but it's funny how well most of them are treated while we are called potentially dangerous. They think we have always had this low self-esteem. They think we have always had our negative views about ourselves. I'm not saying people should crap on the bullies who admit to it, but how the bullying never ends. \n\nWhen I was in school, nobody cared about bullying. They thought it's just kids being kids. I remember one kid on the bus who was older and larger would always jump next to me, call me names, then sometimes punch me. After months of this I finally told someone I didn't want to ride the bus anymore. They asked why and I told them because I kept getting beat up. His friends would join in too making any chance of self-defense impossible even if I did know how to fight. What action was taken? They brought him into an office with me and told us both to stop. On the bus ride home he resumed beating me up with his friends laughing. If that kid as an adult said he regretted it, everyone would say you were just a kid and that's how kids are.

No girl ever had a crush on me and I have absolutely no worth on the 'dating marketplace'. I'm still continuing to work on myself, and even though I've made improvements, nothing changed - girls are still romantically repulsed by me. I wanna know what's the best way to deal with never being in a relationship.\n\nI tried Replika and other chatbots, and they either aren't convincing enough or, in Replika's case, the AI started advertizing stuff and was basically very dismissive to everything I say. As for 'girlfriend roleplay', I never found anyone who was willing to roleplay with me. They outright told me that it was too disturbing and that they're not willing to do it. As for dating sims and such, I can't find any dating sims for guys that have a player insert protagonist and aren't shitty hentai games with no story (I'm not looking for sex, I'm looking for romantic stuff). The closest I got to real dating was dating another desperate person over the internet, and naturally, it ended really badly.\n\nI don't like arguments which say stuff like \"not having a girlfriend means you won't have children which is good because blah blah blah...\" I don't like these sorts of arguments and they never work on me, especially since I belong to a nationality with a strongly declining population. On the topic of having children, I guess I could become a babysitter or something, but that still means that I'll never raise my and my (hypothetical) wife's descendant. And having \"personal freedom\" isn't freedom at all. I just feel lonely and depressed, and I'm 100% certain that I'd feel better if I had a girlfriend. My goal in life was to raise a stable family (unlike my own, dysfunctional family), but it seems that I'd have to abandon that goal. Mail order brides also aren't an option, because I'm not employed, and it would be a loveless marriage which would hurt both of us (although she'll get her papers likely and be happy). \n\nI really think that I'm unloveable, and I've given up on thinking that I'll have a girlfriend or that I'll be attractive enough to have a girlfriend. I just need someone to convince me why that's completely alright, especially with the huge social stigma against guys that never had a girlfriend. I just want not to worry about things like this but I always get depressive episodes. I really want to get convinced that never having a significant other is alright. I really need to stop thinking about it and focus on forthcoming exams.\n\nEdit: I noticed that I start being depressed whenever I see someone being a great girlfriend who loves her boyfriend and wish that I'd have a girlfriend like her, only to reflect on the fact that I'll never even have one. I'm starting to get really bitter when I see strangers who are a couple (I'm happy for people I know since they know such joy). And by the way, I have female friends, but they're not attracted to me and that's okay (I know that for sure, they display no signs of being attracted to me and I've even asked one friend out and she refused, but that didn't make me bitter).", "subreddit": "lonely"}

I get attached and have \u201ccrushes\u201d fairly quickly, so over the years (I\u2019m 22 now) my failed attempts have really piled up. I even bit the bullet several times and attempted to ask out/hit on guys that I liked, but my feelings are never reciprocated. Apparently anything I interpreted as a signal (like guys staring, acting nervous, flirting) turned out to be sexual or in some cases I was imagining things. Sometimes I get romantically led on, which is even more scarring honestly. \n\nI end up just feeling so abnormal compared to other girls my age. Most are in long term, committed relationships. Some are even engaged. It\u2019s the norm, honestly, to be in a relationship at this age or to at least have the opportunity for one. Most girls don\u2019t seem to even really have to try very hard, the relationships just happen naturally. \n\nMy best friend is reaching her one year anniversary with her boyfriend. I\u2019m so happy for them, but it makes me realize what I\u2019m missing out on when she shares stories of the dates and conversations and first \u201cI love you\u2019s\u201d. The worst part is she still attracts guys who seem to want something with her (until they find out she\u2019s taken) and she doesn\u2019t even try, she just does normal things like going to the gym, school, or stores. \n\nMy coworkers are always like, \u201cmy boyfriend blah blah blah, do you have a boyfriend? What no? Thought you did, maybe that was someone else\u201d. I know a lot of single girls too.. they are usually fresh out of a relationship, dating/having fun, or they reject every guy because they aren\u2019t interested in something serious. \n\nI used to spend time on this sub a lot, but I stopped because I\u2019m not fully FA anymore, still romantically FA, but not sexually. Honestly I always heard about how it is easy to find sex as a woman, so eventually I tried tinder so I can at least get my sexual desires satisfied sometimes. Its usually fine and helps calm my sex drive, but I have to choose guys who are the douchebag type to avoid getting emotionally attached (I would never desire dating them in a million years). \n\nRecently though it\u2019s not fine and I started falling for a guy because he turned out to be nice and a lot of what I\u2019d want in a boyfriend. It\u2019s my fault, but this quickly has turned into a full on attachment situation where I\u2019m thinking about him constantly and getting too excited at any text, even though I know it doesn\u2019t actually mean shit. I can\u2019t really help myself because he lets me be intimate with him and I don\u2019t want to give that up. I feel so happy every time I make him smile. It\u2019s actually quite soul-crushing, and I need to stop doing this to myself. \n\nAt least when I had \u201ccrushes\u201d before, I just fantasized about things I would do with the guy, but in this situation I now have actual memories and it feels too real but I have a hard time accepting that he will never want me romantically. I feel like I really dug myself deep into a hole. The whole situation brought back a lot of sadness as I remembered why I am doing this, because sexual attention is the only attention I can really get, but I\u2019m still no closer to finding love as I was before. \n\nI\u2019ve kind of just concluded that I need to accept that for whatever reason, I\u2019m not really girlfriend material, and maybe wondering about it is doing more harm than good. \n\nHopefully when I wake up tomorrow my mind will be distracted again(I fill up my life with a ton of distractions) and I won\u2019t feel so bad.

I figured I would share with a community who would understand.\n\nI grew up with a girl, we will call her Suzie. She was my best friend, we did everything together and saw eachother daily. What ever I had I tried to have 2 of so we could both play together. From my view point apperantly we were inseparable. She was a grade over me but just barely. Well I started 5th grade and she started middle school. That day we never talked again (till about 7 years later). I tried so hard to contact her, all I wanted was to see my best friend again. She was so important to me. Finally one day I was playing in the tree in the front yard and her car pulled up to the stop sign. I got her this time, a car window was down, she couldn't ignore me this time. So I jumped out of the tree and ran up. Her mom was surprised and happy to see me. I noticed her in the back and I waved and said hi. Then I heard \"MOM I DONT LIKE HER JUST GO.\" and they sped off. That's when I finally felt abandoned. I always struggled with friends but she always stayed with me before. But now she left me too. I started the first week of 5th grade completely alone.\n\nUntil someone who we will call Mark. Mark got transferred to my school when he moved. I don't remember how the friendship started but it was almost immediate. We hung out every day and I couldn't wait to see him anytime we had the chance. We had the same likes but he was definitely smarter then me haha. Everyday he would finish his school work early. I would go as fast as I could, eventually i got fast enough that I would finish too. We would play chess everyday at school while the other kids finished work. I don't think I ever won. But I just loved talking and playing. Sometimes I would study chess hard and be so convinced I would win. Nope I didnt, but the game was funner haha. That is until we graduated 5th grade. My parents are way to church obsessed and thought middle school would ruin me. So I was pulled into homeschool. I keept calling Mark but he wouldn't answer. I didn't want to be annoying so I would call every other day, then every few days, then once in awhile. Eventually I got a call back! I was so happy. It was his mom... telling me to not call back. One day awhile later I saw him at a store, I was excited but worried. We ended up accidentally making eye contact and I waved and smiled. But he looked back and glared, and walked away. I had been abandoned again. I didn't make any more friends after that, untill.\n\nWe will call him Jake. I had met him years prior at the coast (an hour and a half away) we had alot of fun together and our parents were good friends! But we never saw eachother because of the distance. We were to young to text so we enjoyed the memory's but never saw eachother again. Finally he came down again and we hung out. We had an absolute blast. This was the first time in a long time I was so happy to be with someone (or really that happy at all). We promised we would find a way to keep in contact. We exchanged phone numbers and texted eachother as he rode home.\n\nThe next day I texted him but he didn't respond. I figured he was busy. I learned that night I had been abandoned again. He committed suicide. I cried off and on for days. I refused to think about it again for a long time. Since then I still haven't been able to keep a close friend. They all leave or stop talking to me. But I don't usually get as close as I used to. I'm having trouble these days being so lonely. But I can't so much about it. Being homeschooled I have no idea where to meet people. And I'm still to young to go to bars and such. Maby someday I can be close to someone my age again. I want to so badly.\n\nNow of days I volunteer my time at different places such as shelters. I try to make friends my age and even did make one, but he moved and I was alone again. I will admit I have some wonderful friends who are not my age. I love them dearly, but the age gap prevents us from doing anything outside of volunteer work and I don't blame them. I do enjoy them anytime im around them though. They always thank me for my work, and wonder why people my age don't want to stay with me. I want to take the complements and I appreciate them more then words can express but inside I feel like I'm not worth it. People I've loved in the past sure didn't see me as worth it.

I change moods so quickly. I've mentioned before how my shitty abusive childhood effects me today, and how anime and cartoons and such can trigger depression for me. Well, I've been doing alright lately. Not good, not horrible. Just alright. But, that's ages better than I usually do. Anyways, I was talking to a few friends of mind, because the three of us were talking and laughing and making jokes as we waited for my our other friend to get on. During this, we brought up Senko-san, that weird wolf loli that's apparently \"800 years old\". Anyways, I made some jokes about it to make my friends laugh (I combat pain and anxiety with humor and wit), but it put me from being alright and having fun to being downright suicidal and wanting to die. I think it's the innocence and near perfection of anime and cartoons and movies and other media like that that triggers it. If I see a pretty girl, it happens. If I see an anime, it happens. Cartoons, movies, some video games. Hell, even when I see simple hentai pop-up adds or hentai in general (though I don't see them for the reasons you may imply). Just seeing innocent, or cute, or just general things like that, it can put me from being in a great mood, to wanting to straight of end my own life.

A lot of the posts here are very enlightening and close to home. Nothing here seems immature in any way. I saw a comment before creating this post about someone who's alone doesn't enjoy being that way. It's just that being among people has disappointed them. That's very much where I'm coming from. I don't even know where to start and what to include. I was a UC Berkeley student who left school to go to Israel/Palestine to work with an NGO. I ended up marrying a Refusenik and worked in several NGOs all around the world. We then moved back to the Bay Area where I wrote and self-published a novel and became very close friends with an MD who was actually gay but married because he was a refugee with an incredibly conservative family. My husband hated the doctor though and eventually we divorced because he wanted to have facial reconstruction surgery (it was \\*somewhat\\* medically necessary but he could have done it slower with braces.) My MD was my only friend for quite a while after that. Right at the point where I'd finally moved into a new place and gotten a job that could have potentially sustained me, the MD's wife found out about both the fact that her husband was gay and that he'd confided more in me than in her. As a result, she made a false allegation against me that I'd threatened her and cops show up at my house and demand I come with them to a psych hospital. I eventually got everything worked out but I lost my new place as a result and I lost my only friend. A year later I crushed my ankle and had no permanent home in San Francisco. When I went to the Urgent Care clinic, they told me, \"We have to take you on the stretcher around the corner to the hospital \\*right\\* now!\" I said I wouldn't have anyone who could help if I was in a cast and I wanted to try to arrange something and come back. However, because I was only a consultant I had no insurance at the time. The clinic failed to mention that if I didn't have surgery at that moment I'd be unable to have my ankle reconstructed at any future time. It was 3.5 years before I was finally able to get healthcare that covered me for Reconstruction surgery at a hospital that was actually capable of restoring movement. The crushed ankle had improperly re-healed itself and even after I started paying $200/month for a good PPO, I had to leave San Francisco and move to southern CA and finally sign up for a $490/month PPO to have access to Cedars-Sinai, the only hospital out of the 5 I'd been to over the whole of 2016 who had a surgeon confident he could restore movement. The surgery was successful but unfortunately the OR nurse missed the fact that the xanax script I had was contraindicated with the oxy the surgeon gave me for the post-op pain. I went into a state of hypoxia, spent 6 days in the ICU and 3 weeks in Neuro-Rehab. I lost 60% of my hearing and ended up with a mild traumatic brain injury. It primarily affects my short term memory. That was in 2017. I've literally just been hiding in my mom's house in the Los Angeles suburbs ever since. I have a therapist but he isn't a real friend. Genuine friends  are like family. People who feel like family straight away. I've met a some people since moving down here but I recoil from most of them. Developing a friendship fatigues me physically. I actually got tested for sleep apnea because unless I was simply sitting in my room, anything I tried to do exhausted me. I lived in the Bay Area from '95-2017, with about 3-4 years spent overseas. I'm out of place down here in southern California but I fear I may be out of place even if I returned to SF. I don't expect any replies. I just thought I'd write out my story. And I'm 42 by the way.", "subreddit": "lonely"}

 isn't that a contradiction?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\ni don't want people to be judgmental or cast stones for me, i know that's not what i want. its hard for me to articulate how i feel to be honest.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nlike i said, i've been alone.  i've been alone now for longer than i ever have been in my whole life.  i try to force myself to consider whether or not there is something seriously wrong with me, and that this flaw is the cause of my loneliness.  i feel extremely betrayed by my friends.  why'd they invite my ex into the group knowing she was a cheater?  and my best friend - i wasn't expecting people to cast him out or shun him, nor did i want that.  but what hurt me was seeing no reaction from anyone to the events going on.  it really messes with my head.  was i supposed to not be hurt by what happened?  i care about people in general, and i love my friends.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nis there some critical component of human compassion or understanding that i'm missing?  why am i this hurt when no one around me really seemed to think that anything hurtful had taken place?  why'd they just go along with my best friend and my ex in their new relationship?  it seems so slimy to me.  why'd everyone adopt such a complacent attitude (at least from my perspective)?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\ni thought people stuck up for each other if something bad happened or if someone was wronged.  aren't friends supposed to try to do right by each other?  i don't get it.  my mom is really encouraging.  i have a therapist too.  both of them make things much easier for me.  they make it easier for me to love myself when i feel alone, and have made it possible for me to just keep on with my life.  i am grateful for that.   they both tell me i'll meet people.  i don't doubt that, but i do doubt myself.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\never since this happened, i've just felt deficient.  like i'm missing a factory part, like somehow when i interact with people they can sense my deficiency on a subconscious level that directs them away from me.  i work in a big city, i am always surrounded by people.  people confound me.  i used to really resent the people that seem happy.  now all i see is that there are so many people that are just, i dunno, people are so complicated.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\ni think people don't know how much we actually love each other.  i think in a lot of ways right now the world lends itself more towards obfuscating that fact.  i love and i miss my friends so much.  i want to love those guys and be around them, but i can't.  they really hurt me, and unless my personal compass is totally wrong i probably shouldn't go back to those people.  i love and miss people so much in general.  i playfully use the term \"wilderness\" to describe how i feel about where i'm at right now emotionally.  its perfect.  i look around at all of these people all day, they've all got SO MUCH going on.  i feel like i can't reach anyone, like there is some dense, nearly impassable terrain or boundary totally separating \"me\" from \"them\", or literally anyone.   and if i did, is that the right person?  will it work?  is there any substance here?  its like i'm meeting fucking Klingons or some shit.  i have zero precedent to rely on with respect to forging new connections after the \"loss\" that i personally feel i suffered.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\ni know there's got to be at least two or three people out there i can love with my full heart.  there's no way i sit here sometimes dreaming about loving new friends, a new partner - without at least a couple of those people actually existing somewhere in the world.  maybe not a group, but maybe A friend?

I haven't had someone to go out with in over 10 years. At most, I've had acquaintances but they aren't friends. It's not the same. FA destroys you over time. \n\nSomeone will say how because they were single for a year despite having companionship from friends, and family, they can relate to a FA'er. Sure, FA'ers can have friends and they help with companionship, but even they still probably feel empty if they have never had a relationship. There are different types of FA. I'm not saying people or more or less FA than other people. I'm saying while things like friends can help, FA can still wear you down if you are deprived of that sort of companionship. \n\nMy FA which everyone knows about since I post about it so much has caused me to have so many other issues that even if she did exist, and approached me tomorrow, my years of isolation will tell me to not trust her even if she is being genuine. FA is like being stuck on an island alone for years. That would be a good idea for a movie. A guy gets stuck on an island for years and is rescued but isn't able to return to who he used to be due to the years of isolation would be a movie I would watch. Maybe it could star Tom Hanks as the guy. That's how I would act if a woman approached me and said she was interested in me. My mind is so destroyed, I wouldn't be able to accept it. What about you?

It has the fuselage, cockpit, wheels, and the rest, but the wings are completely gone:\n\n* Pilot: Why does this plane have no wings?\n* Attendant: When I asked the builders to build me 27 planes ,they happened to run out of materials and never finished this one.\n* Pilot: But why bother to keep it at all them?\n* Attendant: Didn't make sense to get rid of it - it would take too much time and effort to strip it down again or to tow it away.  Nobody would buy it, not even for scrap if it meant having to come all the way out here to pick it up.  We might scrap it for parts ourselves, but it's getting too old now - all the fleet we've got now just use new replacement parts, and when one of them is too busted up, we just build a new one and charge more for the privilege of renting that one.\n* Pilot: So you aren't putting wings on this one?\n* Attendant: Nah, there's no need.  Besides, why do you even care?  I've still got 26 other planes to choose from, there are lots of options for you without having to worry about this one plane that has no wings.  Just forget you saw this one and let's talk about which of the rest would fit your needs.\n\nThis scenario goes on and on every time someone new visits the field.  It makes sense though, right?  A pilot needs a plane that can fly and a plane without wings has no chance of doing so.  Maybe if half the fleet was similarly disabled a pilot might be convinced to try driving one of the wingless planes like a bus to his destination.  But why would any pilot do that if 96% of the fleet is good and only 4% is defective?  It doesn't make sense for anyone to pick up that plane.  I wouldn't even do it if I was a pilot.\n\nPeople are not airplanes, but some of us are defective just like that one plane with no wings.

After they were over I had to focus on finding a job.  \nAfter weeks of applying for work, I joined a temp agency and started working in a warehouse.  \nThe job was extremely simple and I found myself fucking things up constantly, leading to the other workers absolutely HATING me. They wasted no time in telling me that either.  \nEventually this led to me breaking down one morning, I walked through my door at 6AM and broke into uncontrollable tears for two straight hours.  \n\n\nHowever much I wanted to quit, I knew it wasn't possible. The bills were piling up and I had to keep going.  \nAfter three months the guys who hated me were gone and I became a fulltime member of staff.  \n\n\nHowever, around every corner, things have just continued to go wrong. There I am trying to save as much money as possible, yet more and more bills just keep coming out of the wood work. It's like trying to cover holes in a sinking boat.  \n\n\nOne week I came home to find the fridge had broke, brought a new one.  \nCouple of weeks later the freezer broke.  \nThen the drier  \nThe oven  \nThen the washing machine  \nThe front door lock broke\n\nThe boiler  \nHad three things break in three days at one point. My mobile phone, gaming PC and the phone line.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIn the last two years I've survived redundancy three times, this company is failing and I don't know how much longer I have left there. Also where I go or what I do afterwards. I need to learn to drive ASAP, however that costs money too.  \n\n\nBeen trying to get the soliciters to sort out my fathers will, but that's been nothing but a money sink too, got a bill today for over \u00a3400 even though they didn't finish doing the task which I took them on for.  \n(I work at odd hours, so providing them with the information that they needed has been a chore, I also don't have the information that they require since my father didn't keep a lot of the documents that he should have).  \n\n\nWhen I first started working, I went to see a family member who has experience dealing with this kind of thing. Told them that I would need help and was told \"Oh, you'll be okay\".  \n\n\nThis house has several issues, It was not maintained, everything needs renovating, there is no heating and it has a plant in the garden called \"Japanese Knotweed\". It will destroy the house very shortly if it's not removed. The removal will cost about \u00a310,000.  \n\n\nIn essence I've spent the last couple of years, trying to forge ahead, trying to get to a better place and have a better life.  \nI'm still here spinning my wheels.  \nI'm either struggling to sleep or sleeping way too much, Laying there awake at night with my heart pounding in my chest at about 160 bpm.  \nTrying desperately to get better at hobbies, trying to advance things to a point where I can make money from them and failing miserably.  \n\n\nComing home to a broken down, empty house. Wondering if going to work is even worth it.  \nWondering how things would pan out If I decided to just walk out the door and never come back.  \nHitchhike somewhere, look for something better, something new.", "subreddit": "ForeverAlone"}

I went from a depressed lonely guy with no friends to actually befriending 4 women. It was awesome hanging out and it made me more comfortable around women. Unfortunately, I know that now that I'm done with school I'm going to have no chance of finding someone. My social network is about to evaporate. All of them are out of state students so they are going back home. Even when the semester starts up I don't live close to campus so I'm aware that we will drift apart. I can look back fondly on these times and reminisce about what it was like to finally have friends. I'm no closer to finding someone than when I first started but I have no regrets because I tried my damndest my final year. I'm closer to 30 than I am to 20 so it's about time to try and go find friends that live near me. If there's one take away for me it's that romantic relationships aren't the end all be all. I had a blast platonically hanging out with these women. The encouragement, love, and support will be the thing that I will miss most. Any tips for making friends will be appreciated. I got so damn lucky making friends with these 4 that I doubt I could replicate it even if I wanted too.

The phrase \"there's plenty of fish in the sea\" implies that if we keep looking we will eventually find the one for us, in my experience this is not the reality of the situation. Regardless of the implication the effect this has on our society is the lack of investment into one individual person, if there are 7Billion+ people on the world surely you'll find the ONE person who matches you perfectly. This is a lie, there is no \"one\", there is only hard work and strife, and no this is not \"settling\". So many of the people I see online and in real life seem to have this mindset, and no I am not saying that standards are unreasonable, the thing that is unreasonable is thinking you can go through life thinking love is like a wine tasting. There seems to be this notion that you'll know the person you will end up spending the rest of you life with instantly. So often the interactions I see are those of someone testing the water, waiting for some magical sign that this person is better than the last 50 they've met. That \"special connection\" you've been looking for all your life is not something you can find in a dozen text exchanges or a couple of dates. The \"special connection\" everyone is always looking for is not found, it is built, on the backs of hard work, dedication to one another, and strength of character.  How on earth does anyone expect to find a relationship if they flee after a couple of dates or exchanges because \"there's no spark\"? Kindle that fucker! A relationship involves two people working to make something happen, not just falling into place with \"that perfect someone\". Life isn't romantic, it is hard, it is full of death, sickness, blood, sweat, and tears, life is struggle, life is fear, life is sadness. You know what's romantic? Sticking with someone through and through, fighting for other people, believing in other people. Romantic is strength, romantic is looking into your best friend's eyes and know that you've got each other's back in this mad, mad, clown world we live in. If you aren't throwing everything you have into every potential relationship you might come across, if you think that someone will sweep you off your feet, if you think for one instant that romance has anything to do with the real world you are dead wrong.

I know what it feels like to have nothing...have absolutely no one....to put it simply, it feels like poopoo.\n\nHigh School was the true turning point for me, guess I matured over the time...it was then that I fought it...fought it hard... I fought to change myself, fought to redefine myself...and it worked...I was able to be, a genuine friend...with people now who care immensely about me.\n\nIt was, and still is, the greatest feeling...you know, to know that people will greet you positively...to have people text you stuff...to have people want to hang out with you...it's a good feeling.\n\nBut, of course, we humans are greedy creatures...and,well... I guess I just wanted more...\n\nRepression is the best way I'd describe the way I dealt with my feelings when it came to love...when I was a kid, I had this notion to be mentally strong, that my strength wasn't my durability, but the ability to keep pushing forward even after failure...still believe it...\"The only way to truly fail is to learn nothing\"...guess even by that criteria, I've failed...I've been hurt many times, stories I might tell later...best way to describe my love life: Me repeatedly trying to ram my head through a brick wall...you could probably guess how it usually ends.\n\nI guess the need to find someone to love comes from the fact that I've wanted someone to walk the path of life with me...for it be a long and lonely road...you know it's funny, 'cause I've friends who've said they see themselves alone for the rest of their life...despite being in a relationship...I could only shake my head...a part of me even wants to get angry...they don't know what they're asking for...least that's what I tell myself...they don't know the pain, I reassure myself...I'm closing to 20 next month, and I've never been in a relationship...lot's of people I talk with about this have tried to reassure me, and I get what they are saying.\n\nI'm young, I've got time...but I'm also slowly starting to give up...after all, there's only a certain amount of times you can ram yourself into that wall before somthing inside you wants it all to stop...if not for purposes of self-preservation...even now, I have a crush on someone who's out of my league, and I'm debating about weather to go all \"hail marry\" or beat my feelings back down with a baseball bat...the deck has been stacked again me from the start...

I\u2019m in the middle of my A level exams and spent the majority of the day alone. I\u2019ve never really enjoyed birthdays as I always end the day feeling sad and disappointed and therefore guilty for how fucking ungreatful I am. I had a card from my dad, he had made it himself, which is thoughtful. However it featured a blown up picture of me stuck onto a piece of paper with the printed words of \u201clove mum &amp; dad\u201d on the inside. It did not contain a message, which I thought was odd.. He came home and asked if I liked it, of corse I replied I did and pointed to the mantle piece as proof of my approval as it sat perched on the ledge. Then he went and sat in his room and I didn\u2019t see him again. Later my mother came home with some cake which was nice but after a hurried \u201chappy birthday\u201d she was glued to her phone which rather spoiled the moment. Me and my mother then went to my cousins houses, he didn\u2019t know it was my birthday which shouldn\u2019t have bothered me, but it did. We went home just before my sister returned from her last day at the nursery she had worked at for 2 years. She was accompanied with sacks up on sacks of thoughtful goodwill gifts, amount them 3 bottles of procecco. After she displayed and explained the relevance of her gifts I asked her, knowing she didn\u2019t like them, if I could have her procecco. She agree and in the next room I downed two of them.

I had a great click of friends when I was in middle school, but I had a bad fall out with them right before high school. \n\nI did have friends in highschool, but I never felt as happy with these new ones as I did with my old. Even in romantic relationships I felt alone (and very embarrassed bc said partner would be my only physical friend there). As a result, I felt a very deep sense of loneliness throughout my highschool years. I did have (and still do) have one old classmate who i texted constantly to cope, but we live far away from each other. If anything this worsened my loneliness because he was there, but not really there if that makes sense. We also can\u2019t talk everyday because living seperate lives is a thing. This feeling of loneliness and dread at the idea of having no one there with me makes me feel like I\u2019d be better off dead. \n\nI didn\u2019t know how to make new friends or how to approach people. I\u2019m very introverted so that doesnt help me either. I do feel a sense of peace when I\u2019m working on personal art projects or something, but then I feel lonely again when I have no people close to me to share it with. I go to a community college now and am about to transfer to a new college, but sometimes I wonder if that will actually help me.

However, I have been watching a documentary series about Christian Weston Chandler (Chris Chan for short), and I think that did it for me. The way these numerous people treated a high-functioning autistic man is goddamn sick to me. The things that made him do, the things they did to hurt him for a quick laugh, everything they had done just to get a reaction out of him. It's terrible. It's absolutely fucking terrible. I may be missing something, so correct me if I'm wrong. However, if you don't know the story of Chris Chan, I'll give you one example of what these trolls did to him. A group of them tormented him by having one of them pretend to be a girl named Julie, knowing that Chris craved a loving partner. They then pretended that Julie's \"brother\" (who was really the same 13-year-old boy who pretend to be Julie) was keeping her from talking to Chris. They had previously tricked the poor guy into giving them his PSN password, the password to his websites, etc. To make him get it back, one of the things they made him do, and I repeat, ONE of the things they made him do to get the accounts back was cut up a medallion he had made himself that he wears everywhere, and then shove the piece UP HIS ANUS. AND THAT'S JUST KNE EXAMPLE. I know I'm late to the party on this story, but Jesus Christ! How can somebody be so goddamn cruel! And that's just one example! I'm goddamn scorching angry!

I'm 26, never had anything remotely similar to a girlfriend. I'm suicidal sometimes, in fact I tried to kill myself in 2011. It's been a long and torturous journey to the present, but with the help of some fellas from the MGTOW community, I managed to put myself in the center of my life after 12 years. For the first time in many years I feel like the protagonist of my own life. The bad part is that my life is spiraling down to homelessness since my family is full of debts, but I decided that I'm gonna make one last effort to live the best way possible until our financial collapse. My contingency plan is my grandfather's shotgun.\n\nIn the meantime I have a job that's tolerable. Most of my money goes to pay somebody's else debts, but I steal (from myself) some money to buy things in Digimon Masters Online.\n\nBut that's not my coping mechanism. I like to draw erotic stuff. To be honest with you guys, I don't give a fuck whether this is sexist or not, or if sex is not as porn depicts it. I only care about the necessity that I have to do certain things, my fantasies, and since I have nobody to carry them out, my only option is to draw them. For a very long time I envied my friends who had gfs. Sometimes when I invited them to theater and they declined, and I knew their reasons. I was forced to make everything alone. My imagination ran wild every time my friends decided to prioritize their gfs. I used to have a female friend who was, like the dream wife (at least for me) she dated the same guy since they were 16. Then the guy broke with her because he moved to another city. My friend used to tell me about the \"naughty\" stuff they used to do. She's married and has a son now. I chewed on her stories for hour and hours while I was trying to sleep, and many of them were very \"movie like\", so I used as inspiration for my drawings.\n\nWhat kind of coping mechanisms do you guys use?

People think about themselves mainly and maybe they feel the same way you do. Maybe they wish someone asked them how they were doing or told them goodnight.

In fact, people in general won\u2019t think about you much at all unless you give them a reason to. \n\n\n\n\nIt\u2019s important to accept what we have and make it work because life isn\u2019t scripted.

You\u2019re realizing how strange society is and social interactions are complex and don\u2019t always result in the way you expect. Most people to almost everyone is awkward and confused at some point in their life. Only through lots of experience, failures and practice do we start to flourish in social situations. Just be straightforward! Pretend you\u2019re deadpool. Break the 4th wall. Comment on what life is like for you and how odd it is that we\u2019re just organisms grunting at each other.

Don\u2019t see the world as if it owes you something, but rather you need to actively look for what you want and take it.

I can\u2019t believe I feel much better now. I also can\u2019t believe it\u2019s been 3 months since my original post. A lot has changed in such a short period of time. \n\nThings are difficult, life is. But I\u2019m not in such despair. @it_changes really helped me understand the difference between loneliness and despair. Once armed with that, I began to question and challenge all my emotions. When I encountered repairing emotions, I basically had to imagine them as a separate person within me, challenge them, debate them, and then tell them they had no claim on my life. All the lies they told, I challenged them but doing or not doing their commands. For instance, I had this very convoluted thought that I shouldn\u2019t go outside because there is nothing in the world for me. But then I remembered how I chose to live where I live because of the lake and the how social it is. Every time I walked the lake, even if I started hating it. I ended up having a good time. Or my work, it was such a chore to go to work. But then I remembered this was my dream job. \n\nI also started counting my blessings or recounting the things in my life that I really liked about my life or self or body. I\u2019m overweight, but I really like my hands, my face, my skin complexion. I like my quirky sense of humor, etc. I also started to count all the things I have done right. No matter how minute. If it was right, I counted it. \n\nIt\u2019s amazing, after a while, something clicked in my mind- maybe I\u2019m not so bad after all. \n\nAnd pain, now, I\u2019m learning I\u2019m not the pain. I am experiencing pain but I am not pain.  I\u2019m able to differentiate myself from it abs identity it as communication from my brain that something is not right. Not that me as a person is not right. \n\nI started to listen to myself. And I learnt, you know what? I actually don\u2019t like chips or watching movies all day. These activities just numbed me. I couldn\u2019t face my emotions because I didn\u2019t really know what they were or how to. Now. When I experience an intense emotion, I don\u2019t crave foods or movies anymore because know I know it won\u2019t help. I\u2019m forced to find other things. Now I\u2019m on a quest to find the things I like. \n\nI also became aware of how much I feared people, feared making mistakes, rejection and abandonment. Listening to Jordan Peterson and other podcasts helped me that the world is a both a malevolent and beautiful place. I used to be fearful of this but given we are here now and there is nothing I can do about it, the least I can do right now is just accept the world as is but find my way through it, not as a weak, fearful person. This I am still working on. I have started reconsidering how I view my work. I have also taken up paining. I started saying no to people and I am currently removing stuff from my apartment that I don\u2019t like or never did. Gosh! There is so much shit I took into my like because of fear or thinking it would make me not like able. I have also started with exercising slowly as well. \n\nI just wanted to say, thanks to everyone! Thanks so much for your words to me. You have no idea, really! There were so uplifting. \n\nI hope my update is encouraging to you and hopeful to others out there. \n\n\u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f", "subreddit": "lonely"}

I cannot save anything - by the end of the month I'm always left with nothing because I cannot save on the necessities.\n\nI'm living in a foreign country all alone. You could say I ''ran away'' as soon as high school ended for me because I didn't want to live with my parents anymore. It's been almost a year now and I didn't really make much progress. I learned the language but not enough to work in an office or to have a serious job. \n\nMy dad visited my aunt this week and we ended up meeting, which ended up in him trying to force me to come back to my old country to study. But guess what, it's fucking impossible there. I wouldn't mind studying at all if 1. I knew what I wanted to do in life because I don't just want to study whatever, and 2. If I could live there by myself and could afford it.\n\nYou see, in my country it's extremely difficult to get a job, whatever it may be. So of course the logical thing for me to do seemed to go abroad and start there.\n\nAnd I just cannot live together with my parents. They always said they didn't have money for anything I needed. But that was a lie, I saw my dad's bank account balance once by accident and there definitely was a good amount of money there. It's much better to live alone but I don't have anyone now (not like I ever did tbh but I guess now it's more visible to me because I don't have anybody around me).\n\nI'm lost. I don't think I'm good at anything at all. I don't see myself living much longer so even if I try to research some careers, in the end what does it matter? I want to die anyway. I don't even know what I'm doing and how I got that far with no money or help from my parents. Not like they would help me anyway, back at home they loved to remind me how much of a burden I am to them and now that I am gone suddenly everything is fine between us.\n\nWell, it isn't for me. I'm conflicted. I don't know what to pursuit in life, and I'm stuck. My only goal right now is getting a better paying job and buying a car. But after that I don't know what I will do.\n\nI told one colleague at work that I ''probably plan to quit'' because he asked me and I trusted him (which was obviously a mistake). Next day I was called in by my boss. They accused me of wanting to quit, and got mad because I didn't tell them. Thanks a lot, bitch.\n\nSo now at work they treat me like shit because they know I'll be gone in a month anyway. Honestly they don't even treat me like a coworker anymore and I hate it. I never liked this job but it got even worse somehow.\n\nSorry for the long post. I really could use some advice right now.

Right? Wrong!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**A little about myself**\n\nSchizoid personality, tall and average looking guy, 3 suicide attempts, never had a girlfriend.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**So how it was?**\n\nI was thinking about loosing virginity with prostitute some time ago (when I was 26). I knew, that this is the only way. I even started preparing for doing it, but some other problems in my life moved  this goal away. I promised to myself that I will do it next year. And after year and half, this promise started to push me very hard\u2026 I was afraid (and to be honest, this was one of the reasons why I decided to move this goal to the next year). But my own promise pushed me even harder.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo I started preparing again\u2026 I was already working on my physics for about 6 months, and this gave me some extra amount of confidence which I lacked. I started to shave my torso, and overall, taking care of myself. And I started to like (just a little) what I see in the mirror. This gave me another extra amount of confidence. You may say - \u201eProstitutes don\u2019t care about your look. What is the point?\u201d. And I will tell you - \u201eYou are wrong\u201d.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nCondoms. Every guy should know how to use condoms before having sex for the first time. But I didn\u2019t expect what I will find out about myself when I was buying condoms for the first time. I have big dick. I didn\u2019t realise it immediately. I bought regular condoms from shop, and thought that I was just doing something wrong (I was not able to wear it, and it was painful). After a little of googling I realised that I have big dick. I was happy and sad at the same time. \u201eYou have big dick and you are a virgin at 27? What a looser!\u201d - I was saying this to myself. Anyway, after trying different condoms I managed to find a perfect size for me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI started googling prostitutes in my city, and for my surprise, I found them very fast. There was a special site for it. Nude photos with blurred faces, description of what they can do for you, price, time when they are available, phone numbers, opinions of clients (I couldn't believe in this). So the only thing which left, was to call them. And I was afraid...\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI don\u2019t know why, and how, but after couple of days when I returned from work, I just opened that site, found girl which I liked, and called her. I thought that it is better to arrange \u201emeeting\u201d on next day, and told this on phone. The girl said to call on the same day when I want to come, and I agreed. This phone call was very stressful for me. I was almost shaking like a little dog. Pathetic...\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI knew that I need to deal with that fear and stress, before actually going to prostitute. Or this thing (sex) will just not happen. Likely, I already knew a hack for dealing with fear \u2013 alcohol. I bought a bottle of red wine (I didn\u2019t want to buy something stronger, because I wanted just to reduce fear and stress, while still having control on myself). And the other thing which always improved my confidence, was a short period after physical training (for about 3 hours after training, I was usually feeling very \u201ealpha\u201d).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo the day has come. I called that girl. A girl with different voice than previously, answered. It was a bad sign, but I didn\u2019t care. We arranged \u201emeeting\u201d in 4 hours. There was no going back for me\u2026 I went to do my physical exercises. Returned feeling much better. Took shower. Drank wine. Went to her place. I was feeling confident as fuck. Alcohol and post workout confidence worked like a charm. The girl opened door and I entered. She wasn\u2019t the one from photos, but was attractive, and I was drunk (not too much). It was a brothel.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnd here comes a disaster\u2026 After a minute of \u201emovements\u201d with her, my erection went off\u2026 Just turned off. Completely. The girl tried to help me, but nothing worked\u2026 I felt fear during the whole process (so eventually, fear won me). I explained to her that it was my first time with prostitute (didn\u2019t say anything about being a virgin). I lied that I had a girlfriend long time ago. That I just did\u2019t have sex for many years...\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWent home happy, sad and surprised that all this happened to me\u2026 Going to prostitute. Being virgin. Big dick. Extreme fear. Erection problems. I couldn\u2019t believe. I was proud and sad. Sad because it didn\u2019t count. I didn\u2019t cum. And also, I almost didn\u2019t feel any satisfaction from that sex. It wasn\u2019t like masturbation. At some point, it was even painful (yes, painful).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAfter a week, I decided to do it again. But before that, I bought some medicaments for erection problems (not viagra). Again, I called a girl (different one), and moved to her place. It was brothel again (but a different one). I was drunk. The girl was ugly (3/10), but I decided to stay, just to gain some experience. There was less fear, and the girl was submissive (which I liked). There was almost no sex, because she complained about my size, and insisted to finish with blowjob. The erection was there, but was weak. Again, I almost didn\u2019t feel any satisfaction, and the pain (on my glans) which I felt before, was there again. Didn\u2019t cum.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI went home. There were three problems which I needed to fix: fear, weak erection, zero satisfaction, glans pain. I thought that the problems with erection and satisfaction came from glans pain, so I started googling. I found that my glans were not used to friction. I always masturbated with my foreskin, so I started doing it without. First time in condom, then without. With lub. It was painful, but after a month I started to enjoy it.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWent to prostitute again (different one). Was drunk. Took medicaments for erection. It was better (but still not as good as masturbation), but I didn\u2019t cum again...\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nStarted googling again, and found that alcohol can prevent from reaching orgasm.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWent to prostitute again (4th time!). Wasn\u2019t drunk (and was very stressful because of it). Took medicaments for erection. And for my surprise, I managed to finish this time! Finally...\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBut the story didn\u2019t finish for me. I wanted to eliminate fear completely. To not use medicaments for erection. To have longer sex. To enjoy it as much as I enjoy masturbation. I decided to spent my time dealing with these problems, by going to prostitutes. At the time of writing this, I already had sex with prostitutes 15-20 times (don\u2019t remember exact number). Unfortunately, some of these problems I still didn\u2019t solve. I am too much damaged\u2026\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Do I regret about it?**\n\nHell no! Going to prostitutes was one of the best decisions in my life. My confidence improved a lot! I don\u2019t call myself virgin any more, like I did before (this probably was one of the reasons why I tried to kill myself). People who say that virginity does not matter are retards. The sex is everywhere! In TV, movies, shows, internet, songs, books, magazines, games, cookie talks during lunch at work, half naked women on streets, girls in leggings in gym, etc. YOU CAN\u2019T HIDE FROM IT. It is a nature. And it is important for every healthy men to have it.", "subreddit": "ForeverAlone"}

My hard work is appreciated. Something as simple as a hot meal cooked for me after work is enough to make me die happily. She feels safe with me all the time walking through even the most dangerous neighborhoods. \n\nI must have daydreamed again because I'm sitting here alone in the darkness. No texts. No calls.

But as of recent in online dating i am getting more results and currently have gotten like 7 women talking to me within the month. So let me say some of the things I had to work on.\n\nThe biggest issue was I kept devaluing myself over and over. I am a 22-year-old autistic virgin, and I kept saying as something devaluing. What I had to do was not focus on that and look at the better in me.\n\nI also kept having the issue of feeling \"undeserving\" of love as a part of my autism. I'm high functioning, but there's still a lot a woman may not want to handle (which I see as totally fine). I hid it on my dating profiles because of that. But I was upfront in conversations with them and......none of them cared. Like, I even found out one of them has autism from this. I started less and less to see myself as a burden.\n\nI think the final one is to see never having a relationship as a possible good thing in the datibg field, especially in your late 20's. A lot of women want to settle down with a man at that point in their lives, and want someone to be there for her and only her. A lack of exes can be a benefit then, since you are there for her and only her, and she can show you how to love her without any conflicting advice in your head.\n\nButvthe biggest was creating a group of friends i can be open with. Men make the big mistake of only relying on their partner for emotional support. I decided to rely on friends instead, like many women do, and i felt way less alone.\n\nI'm not saying doing these things will help everyone, but maybe it can help someone else out there. I hope someone, anyone, finds this helpful.\n\nRegardless, thanks for coming to my TEDTalk. Have a great weekend", "subreddit": "ForeverAlone"}

I\u2019d consider myself average to below-average looking, at 6\u20192\u201d. I\u2019ve never had a girlfriend or any friend groups. Most days I come home and play video games until I need to go to bed. I\u2019m pretty overweight (around 235lbs) and most of it is in my stomach and neck, which are the worst spots honestly. No one has provided any interest in me romantically but to be fair I e never put myself out there. I go to a good school and get good grades, so I\u2019m not too worried about a job. I just need help before I reach the point of no return.", "subreddit": "ForeverAlone"}

Almost like depression has been weighing me down or something and the gears in my head are actually starting to turn and snap me out of it. I\u2019ve realised it\u2019s all about realising what you want out of life instead of following what everyone else does. I actually don\u2019t care about getting laid or finding someone all that much and I\u2019m content with my own company and enjoying life day to day now, pursuing my hobbies for my own sake and not to impress anyone else. \n\nEvery time in my life I tried to accept myself like I have now, there was always this voice at the back of my head telling me that I\u2019m settling for mediocrity or coping and that I shouldn\u2019t accept myself, otherwise I\u2019d be inadequate and use that as an excuse to slack off. It would always drag me down and make me feel worse about myself. I\u2019ve been watching a few videos on YT about depression and how there\u2019s this inner voice that you need to learn how to silence that can manifest itself as a kind of \u201cmacho\u201d voice, and it really resonated with me. It made me realise that this voice in my head telling me that I need to be successful, not settle for less etc. was the voice the video mentioned, and I\u2019ve began to realise when it happens and become better at shutting it out. I had no idea how much harm this voice was doing to me and questioning it has taken the sting off of the thoughts. \n\nEveryone is different and accepting yourself is hard when it feels like a foreign thing to do, but it\u2019s worth a shot.

I have the height going for me (191 cm) but that\u2019s not enough, despite what many on here would tell you. \nSo yesterday I was at a party with some friends. It was a birthday party hosted by a girl from my class. She had invited her class (as previously mentioned) and some of her other friends, so it was a nice mix of familiar and unfamiliar faces. Now I\u2019m definitely \u201cthe quiet kid\u201d of the class. It\u2019s not nearly as bad as it used to be, as I\u2019ve worked on my social anxiety for the last years. But in the end of the day I\u2019m still pretty reserved. I do have a few close friends and the girls of the class always call me sweet instead of creepy (thank god). Anyway, due to my quietness I tend to get pretty drunk at these parties, as it loosens the tongue. Yesterday was no exception. Me and my 2 close friends end up playing some beer pong with each other. We end up getting joined by a few people, including a girl who joins my side. Now I was loosing the match until she arrived, but she evened the score. Meanwhile I\u2019m joking with her and cheering her on and surprisingly she isn\u2019t reacting with disgust. She\u2019s actually having a fun time. Later my class all sit around a table and I get to talking to my crush. Now we usually have decent chemistry, but now we were having a blast together. People come and go, and eventually we\u2019re joined by the girl from earlier, who gets to talking to my crush. Meanwhile, my drunk friend, who\u2019s the asshole of the group, starts berating me for being a kissless virgin (which I am). I fire back, but to no avail. I calmly leave and my friend soon starts drunkenly hitting on the girl. I spend some some time having fun with classmates until I\u2019m approached by the girl from earlier. She takes me by the hand and leads me outside. Here she asks if it\u2019s true that I\u2019m a virgin, which I hesitantly confirm. After this she hugs me and tells me that she\u2019s also a virgin, which surprised me. We stand there hugging for a few minutes. During this she tells me that my crush likes me. Apparently my crush drunkenly told her that earlier in the night. We eventually agree to get back inside as it was cold as shit outside. After this, I get to talking with my crush for a while. Eventually, my crush gets picked up by a friend and we part ways. I then go outside for some fresh air, after which I\u2019m joined by a couple of girls. We get to talking about life and my drunken self is getting them to laugh at my jokes and stories. I couldn\u2019t fucking believe that. We eventually go back inside, where I, during the rest of the night, continue this process with multiple girls. Some of them classmates, others complete strangers. I\u2019ve spent the majority of today thinking about this experience. It seems so surreal to think about. But it was also such a wholesome experience. It felt like I was experiencing something, which I had been missing out on. \n\nSo what is the revelation? Well your drunken self is essentially your \u201ctrue\u201d self. So maybe all the cliche normie advice about \u201cworking on yourself\u201d is partially true. I mean if my ugly ass can do it so can a lot of you guys.

I don't like having people give me haircuts, since every time I do, they mess it up. So, I would usually cut it myself. I went over a year without a haircut, and I let it grow out. Well, lately, I had been sick of how long it was. I wanted a trim. I wanted a few inches taken off. So, my brother and I go to the haircut place (him having borrowed cash from my grandfather to do so), and we got haircuts. Well, the girl who cut my hair only took about an inch off. Mind you, my hair was down to my shoulders/upper back. It was still just as long, at least it seemed so. I wanted to tell her I wanted it shorter so, so badly, but I couldn't. I choked up. It doesn't help that I find it harder to talk to girls than guys. I simply said \"I-It's good, thank you\" and got off the chair because of my social anxiety. It was still too long. So, when I got home, I wanted to cut my hair. I had stood there, looking in the mirror for ages as I held scissors to a part of my hair, just contemplating it. I knew my dad would be pissed (and he has a history of being physically abusive, and he still is to this day emotionally abusive), because whenever I cut my own hair, I cut it too short and unevenly. Eventually, I just cut the hair between the blades of the scissors. I was upset and wanted my hair shorter. Well, the piece I had cut was now too short. I was livid. I was so anxious and so upset. So, I had my brother drive me to my mothers house with the impression that I planned on going to my friends house. I didn't. I went inside, talked to my more understanding brother, and he helped me cut it. It was too short, but it wasn't as uneven as it would've been if I had cut it. It looked (and still does) terrible. It was much too short. But, at the moment, I didn't care. I was more terrified of what my father would say. He told me that I wasn't a man, and that I didn't have \"the balls\" to even speak my mind. That isn't all he said, but it wasn't great. He then told me that I better not pout about what he said to me. Then my other brother (the one I got the haircut with) scolded me too, saying I'd never make it in life if I didn't man up. Now, I have a terrible haircut that's far too short that I'll endure bullying at school for, and my family is pissed at me. I hate myself so much. I'm so, so, so fucking stupid.

And that's before getting to how messed up *I* am. I think it's just my mind wanting it and reading normal friendship signals as something else.\n\nExamples:\n\n* looking at me whenever something funny or strange happens to get my reaction (friends do this..right?)\n* noticing and mentioning when I'm smiling (one time he'd just made a pun, another time I was walking by looking at my phone and he took his headphones off to ask what I was reading/grinning at) (..this too)\n* Another coworker asked what I was thinking for lunch and he answered for me that we'd talked about going to a certain place (we'd just discussed - which was kinda heart-fluttery tbh), but also true. We had just discussed that.\n* Sharing techno songs that have lyrics about love (which there's a decent chance he didn't even notice)\n* when a server at the thai place asked how to split up the checks, he said under his breath, \"we're together, \\[kooshipuff\\] is paying\" (which was probably a joke, though a strange and out-of-place one)\n* We were talking about driving through scenic roads in the mountains and how it's fun to rev your engine in tunnels, and I mentioned my car (which is electric) doesn't do that anymore, and he said I could listen to his (which is a cute little roadster) if we were up there together (which does sound surprisingly intimate for friends, but he's done a similar drive with friends before)\n* Something weird on the patio at work - I stepped out there because I noticed he and another coworker had been away for a bit and figured I'd join whatever chat it was, and when I stepped out he turned around with this scared look on his face and said, \"He's right there!\" ..Then they went back inside. ..And it *seems* like this was a very negative reaction (and that they were definitely talking about me in a likely not-positive way), but like, I don't think it was about me paying too much attention to either of them because both are still talking to me (and not only when I say something first), so it's tempting to think he may have been telling the other guy about feelings he has...but *probably* not? (Though I'm noodling a dark fantasy story with lots of romance and could totally see spinning something like this in where it *is* a secret confession of love.)\n\nAnd this weekend, I dunno, it feels like something shifted and the illusion that he's into me is starting to fade. Nothing actually changed - I guess I just had some time to myself to really think about it. And then this evening, I met a friend of my housemate who reminds me a lot of myself except..he's actually confident and fun and projects energy and presence, and now I'm like, \"Oh. So that's what actual charisma looks like. Yeah, I've none of that.\" Plus, all that stuff up there is probably the clearest indication of interest I've ever had from anyone and..it's probably not real. In which case I've *definitely* never had any interest from anyone. Did I mention I'm in my 30's?\n\nOh. Oh. Oh! And! I did that photofeeler thing and got pretty much the lowest possible score - oddly enough, like person picked very attractive, and then I think one picked attractive and 2 or 3 picked somewhat attractive ... while nearly 40 picked not attractive. Yeah. Aggregate score was 2.2, which was lower even than the other FAers in the thread about it. And I'm pretty sure the picture I uploaded didn't even show my psoriasis, which does *not* help. (Interestingly, one of the respondents said the picture looked old despite my having banged it out right before uploading - not sure what that's about.)\n\nI read the intro to a book about stoicism and how to live a happy life in the modern world based on ancient teachings ... and I do wonder if it might have some guidance. It seems like this whole part of me that seeks companionship has gone wrong, something meant to add depth and flavor to life that, for me, is just dragging me down, like some kind of emotional tumor. When you get a tumor in an organ, you can cut it out, and you might have some long-term consequences, but at least the tumor is gone - but I don't think you can just cut out the desire for a partner. At the same time, I think stoics would say that that desire can and should be tossed aside because it isn't useful and that you don't need anything external to yourself. So maybe there is a way through stoicism. I don't know. It seems worth a try but probably really difficult.\n\nBack to the coworker, we also work together on fun side projects and have a bunch of mutual friends. Springing this on him potentially puts a bunch of that in jeopardy, which honestly would be worth it to give things a try, but realistically, that doesn't really seem possible, and I don't think it's worth risking all that purely to find out for sure. But at the same time, I think I'm going to have an unusually difficult time moving on without some kind of confirmation. And I keep backsliding into thinking about what it might be like to be together which usually doesn't last anywhere near this long. Talking to a mutual friend about it *seems* like the right choice, that way someone familiar with the situation can tell me how dumb I'm being without actually having to bring it up with *him*, but no matter how many times I go over it in my head, I don't come up with a way to bring up even that that doesn't sound completely absurd.

(We have no total control over anything)", "author": "lostwanderer5", "self_text": "Hey, so this is probably going to be my last post on reddit... well because of reasons... will try to stop using reddit so much but this time I guess I will keep my account alive.\n\nOk, so, \u0130 thought a lot and I made the following conclusions:\n\n- No matter how perfect I am, it will never be enough. There is no way (except manipulation, which I dislike heavily) to guarantee that a women will like or even love me. I could be the most communicative, most handsome, most intelligent, most whatever guy in this world, yet there could still be no woman to show interest in me. I have read stories and I actually experienced it kinda second hand. There is always one extra factor, which is determining whether a woman is going to like me or not and I surely have no control over it!\n\n- On the other hand, the world is built in such a way that if we want to achieve something we have to try. For example, if I want to pass my exams, I need to learn for them, but again, like above even in this case there is an extra factor which determines whether I will actually pass the exam or not. You know? I could learn everything, I could be the best in that field, yet I could fail my exam. You might ask why? Did it ever happened to you that you kind of just blacked out in an exam and kinda forgot almost everything you knew? Stuff like this can happen.\n\n- What does all of this mean? It means that we as humans have almost no control over anything. There is only one thing we can do, well actually two, which are trying and praying.\n\n- An example: Let's say we want to plant a flower seed and make them grow. For that, we use our knowledge, maybe we plant the seed during Spuring. Put the flower pot in our balcony or somewhere where it is shiny, we try to water the soil each day (even here we forget it sometimes, a factor we cannot really control, all we can do is using methods which helps us not forgetting it, but even then we might end up just not being in the mood, you know?). Then we might see the seed sprouting, which gives us a little joy and excitement. But we remember that it can get stormy sometimes and rain heavily such that our littler flower friend might get killed by nature (a factor we cannot control). We can take precautions though, maybe we look out for stormy days and keep the pot inside, but even then, what if an earth quake happens (a factor we cannot control). We basically pray (subconsciously) and hope that everything will turn out fine.\n\n- What am I getting at? We can only try. Hope and prayers actually carry us, even if it is subconsciously. We have no total control over anything.\n\nAs a reminder, look at the normie advices \"just go out there/you will meet someone\", well, why didn't I meet anyone in all those years I got out so far? There was an external factor which made me not meet any women so far. And even if there was a woman interested, I might have made wrong moves, I might have talked to myself that \"I don't need anyone\" but realized too late that someone was showing interest in me and I was being completely obnoxious about it.\n\nTo the \"normie/meme advice givers\", wouldn't it be better to encourage people to try out things instead of giving failing advices like \"shower/therapy/going outside/....  =&gt; you will meet someone 100% \ud83d\udc4c\".\n\nWouldn't it be better to actually encourage humans to actually communicate with each other and remind them that a good communication is dependant from the other side as well? A communication is not a one sided thing, you know, where you have to be interesting and what not and the other side can be as boring as possible?\n\nThere were cases where I witnessed that some people just totally shut themselves, making it a challenge (why? Is it fun to make things difficult for other people?) to talk to them. You literally had to crack them open with asking a lot of questions and even repeating a lot of questions. No, these people I am speaking about had no social anxiety or what not, these people coould talk very well and easily. Why make things hard for your fellow humans, if you can make it easy? \n\nAnyways...\n\nTL;DR We can only try. There is no method which works 100% \ud83d\udc4c all the time. Also, it is not always our bad that things don't seem to work out sometimes. Putting all the burden on one person is not the way to go. Advice givers should be more careful about what they are promoting or they shouldn't give empty and kind of meaningless platitudes. E.g. the showers, how do you know someone needs to shower if you don't even know how they smell like. It could be possible that they are more hygienic than you.

Not many people would. I don't blame them; it's not easy being friends with a guy like me. I don't say that like one of those douchebags who says they're \"too much to handle.\" I plain don't have much positive to offer. I add pain to their lives and the poor people just have to deal with it.\n\nI've been \"Forever Alone\" for all my life. My first remember-able memories are those of me in early elementary school, never really being able to connect with the other kids. See, I became FA because my class was fond of gossip even at that age. The reason this ruined my social chances in those early grades was because all I needed to do was mess up a few social interactions with these other kids I've never met and will know for the next 12 years and word gets around. \n\n&gt;*Hey, you know that one kid, 'Anon'?*\n\n&gt;*Yeah, other kids said he acts really weird.*\n\nThings like that ruined my chances, if I were to ever unfuck my social travesty, with people I never even got the chance to meet. Most people in my classes never spoke a word to me, and that was on purpose. The gossip about me being weird a few times already had been common knowledge by the time we were in 3rd grade. New students typically found out quick, and the rare times I was able to get cool with the new kid, he/she would find better friends, and leave me. I spent the vast majority of my classes sitting alone; working alone. The near entirety of my recesses were spent wandering around on the patchy grass field, around 40 ft. from the next-nearest kid, alone. Never took much part in games because other people became upset when I would try to join their play, and I didn't want to make anyone upset, so I never insisted. I grew up with zero fucking backbone and to this day, I am the most pathetic, miserable excuse for a \"man.\"\n\nSometimes, even as early as the second grade, I would go to an isolated tree far on the school field, of go into an empty bathroom across campus, simply to sit down and cry.\n\nAlone.\n\nFrom about 1st to 4th grade, I had multiple problems, and the faculty noticed. I often peed my pants, far more often than other kids would. I also made some concerning twitches in class. I would rock my head around rather quickly, I wasn't very vocal about things, I could never sit still or pay attention to anything very long. The school nurse kept pestering my parents about it until they finally agreed to meet her and talk about me. I don't know the intimate details of the conversation, but I know, at least, that she suggested that i have have ADHD, Autism, and/or some kind if anxiety disorder. Luckily, my father has always worked hard enough to work for a company that pays for good health insurance, so he took me to a very highly recommended pediatric psychiatrist.  He confirmed that I did have ADHD, however he totally disagreed to the Autism diagnoses. Saying the fact that I could look people in the eye and say \"I Love You,\" was enough. \n\nHere in elementary school was the very first time I had a real crush. For around 4 years, I was obsessed with this one girl. It never panned out, as you can imagine being a story from r/foreveralone. Sometimes I talked to her in passing moments, but I was never able to articulate things well. She was a nice girl, because she did her best not to let the boredom show. I would sometimes have small interactions with this girl. Comically small, they're interactions that she would've forgotten within the day, let alone me remembering it years later. It was in the 3rd or 4th grade. We had pulled all our chairs to one corner of the room to watch this documentary on the teacher's tiny CRT TV. I was sitting there, she sat near me, and there was nothing between us. She asked me if she could extend her legs out and rest them on mine. I agreed because this meant a lot to me.\n\nHer resting her legs on my legs meant a lot to me in the moment, and it's still something I remember years later now. I remember even in that moment when I was 8, thinking I was overdoing this moment in my head. Even then, I could see who I would be in this modern day. I think eventually, she found out I liked her. This is a common theme with my crushes, they eventually, inevitably find out I'm crushing on them, and have had a variety of reactions because of it. This time, though, was the first time it happened. She didn't really want to talk to me further, cutting off the already sparse contact we shared. I can't blame her, and I don't hate her now. Nor did I before. I can see why she was bugged by me. \n\nIn 6th grade, we were gearing up to finally go to middle school. This was a big moment at the time because I had been going to the same elementary school since preschool. I was very anxious and was wondering how I would change. 2nd grade was the last time I had gotten all passing grades. My grades began to fall since then, and by 6th grade, I was failing. Badly. I recently had found an old report card. The kind that would give me a break down when I realized I couldn't forge my dad's signature.\n\n&gt;English - D+\n\n&gt;Science - F-\n\n&gt;Social Studies - F-\n\n&gt;Math - F-\n\n&gt;PE - D+\n\n&gt;TEACHER'S COMMENTS: *'Anon' is not receptive in class, often aloof, seemingly absent-minded.*\n\n&gt;TEACHER'S COMMENTS: *Student does not complete work, but is non-disruptive, keeps to himself.*\n\n&gt;TEACHER'S COMMENTS: *'Anon' does not interact with peers, will not complete basic schoolwork, does not respond sometimes when called upon. Student's behavior is concerning.*\n\nI wanted to believe in this fantasy that reaching middle school would change things for me. That I would stop being an idiot. I would stop being a fuckin' failure. I would gain some sense of purpose. Motive. \n\n**A bit of an abrupt stop, but I think I've bitched enough, but I'm always fucking high and I'm always fucking sad so I may be back to continue my shitty life story.**", "subreddit": "ForeverAlone"}

During that time I grew increasingly desperate to find friends. I would wonder \"why don't I have friends? What is wrong with me that no one wants to be around me? Why am I so awkward, shy, dumb, and pathetic?\"\n\nIt made me scared, terrified even, to try and socialize. Every now and again I would get a spur of courage to talk to someone new, but it was far and few between. Most of the time I would just feel anxious around others. Worried that I would say or do something wrong. That I would prove all of my fears about myself right by finding someone I wanted to be friends with only for them to slowly stop talking to me. I wouldnt blame them if they did. I was probably too clingy or desperate or annoying anyway.\n\nIt has been 6 years since that time. I now have more friends than I have time for and more confidence than I thought I would ever achieve.\n\nI have learned in these 6 years that I put far too much pressure on myself to make anyone I met like me. A lot of the time I wasnt even interested in the person I wanted to like me. They were just there and I was lonely and I had low self esteem.\n\nWhat I learned is that finding a friend, finding a true friend, is very very difficult. It is not because you are dumb or shy or frustrating to be around, it is because you have not found the right person. \n\nBecause it *is* inevitable that people will find you annoying or dislike you. That is because you are not yoga pants, you do not fit whoever wears you. And neither do they.\n\nYou are a unique shape trying to find the unique holes who you can combine with. The harder you have to force yourself to combine with a particular hole, the less healthy and worthwhile it is.\n\nAll of that is to say, keep trying to find people because there are many people in the world and you need to find the few who have real potential to be real friends with you. You will find many who dont fit that, and that is okay. You will succeed if you keep trying.

I wanted to share this with you guys because I think my perspective is a unique one.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIn high school I was just the typical clueless guy, dreamed about girls.\n\nCollege I was a recluse studying, a few people tried to get to go out and shit but was too focused on grades. Still just dreamed about girls.\n\nIn grad school I really developed myself and gained confidence, put myself out there a lot, went on tinder dates and things, a slight trickle of interest that never developed any mutual attraction or relationships. Still rejected 100% IRL.\n\nNow I have a good job. Have a really good idea of who I am. Kind of feel 'finally established'. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnd now, I'm freaking afraid to have a relationship:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n1. I discovered that the person who I truly am is non-compatible with 99.999% of women.  For instance, I discovered that I literally HATE children in all forms. Which is an instant dealbreaker for a solid 90%+ of women at this age (I'm 27). I also discovered that women who are in my religion and political stance seem to have the complete opposite hobbies and aspirations as me, and people who are non-religious and of the opposite political stance seem to be the ones I am drawn to. There is a litany of other things but long story short -- I am just TOO unique to the point where just stare at dating apps feeling like there is no one who could possibly accept me, my interests, my viewpoints, etc...\n2. I discovered what an insane responsibility it would be to be in a relationship and marriage. Being in the real world, even though I am set up way better than average, I have enormous responsibility...I just can't imagine any more. I'm imagining just the pressure of trying to keep yourself in presentable working order 24/7. I also learned that 99% of women who I am moderately compatible with are all desperately trying to be housewives. Trying to support another human?? Yikes. And say I did change my kid view and have a kid...Imagine trying to support a freaking wife and kid! How are people doing this?\n3. No matter that I am a small business owner, have a doctorate degree, make in the 1% of income for my age, know who I am, have good pictures, have a social media presence, have some status in the community, have gotten my physical appearance as good as its realistically gonna get....There is still no interest in me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nRIP. F in chat. You hate to see it. etc...\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, everything else is still void, except I've lost a lot of that 'desire' that I always had and it feels very depressing. I now feel dependent on a MIRACLE that some unicorn finds me and likes me. And I know the chances of this are so low that I just assume I'm alone and not trying almost just by choice now. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n Until then I will just continue to make the best decisions I can, be a good citizen of earth, and try to enjoy life where I can.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI've been around here for probably 7 years or so now, don't post much anymore, but just felt like it tonight.

The responses of all the people around me to my grief has left me feeling very lonely. I know that people around me are good people and no one can really get in your head and truly understand you, but I can't help but feel isolated no one understanding me.\n\nMy grandfather was a big role model for me. He had a great and crazy sense of humour, and would take my dad my sister and I out to outdoor adventures during our childhood all the time. I have a lot of wonderful memories because of him. He was also the only one very accepting of my international mother out of the rest of the family and an very xenophobic neighborhood.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm currently a university student so I was away from my family when  I found out he had passed away suddenly which shocked me. I had not seen him for the past 2 years as he is quite far away.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy close friend who lives with me She came to my room as we were about to the movies. I had just found out over the phone about it and was crying. She gave me a hug and said \"I'm sorry for you\" she then asked if I still wanted to go to the movies. I said I did, then did\\`t then said I don't know. She left my room, then shortly I heard the front door slam as she had already left to go to the cinema. Apparently she misinterpreted that I didn't want to go. But I was so upset that she left me alone as quickly as she did.\n\nI know it's hard as a friend to comfort someone during something that you personally have no experience with.  Honestly however I have never felt as alone as that moment. It really hurts that one of my closest friends didn't even ask if I needed her to stay with me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis whole time I haven't really discussed it with my family.  My mum discussed about essentially what a big hassle it would be for me to go to the funeral as they had already booked the hotel without me. She said I should go only if I really really wanted to. In the end I decided not to which I regret massively. I know it's my fault for deciding that in the end but I can't help but feel a massive amount of anger to her for guilting me into not going.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBut I think one of the worst things that came of this is that my immediate family and I found out after his passing that my grandfather was a piece of shit who abused my grandmother and was complacent to my aunt as a child being molested by one of his friends. I really miss him though still, I am confused to be grieving for someone who is not a good person and feel betrayed by him because he was very good to me and I really looked up to him.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI have never dealt with mourning someone before so I don't know of this is normal grief, but I feel like I can't talk about it mourn properly because of the nature of the information I found out about him, as well as the fact I didn't go to the funeral so I have no closure.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI was just wondering if anyone else has been through something similar and what they did to deal with the situation.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTl;Dr , grandad passed away, can't really seem to talk to anyone about it.

I thought she was attractive because she knew exactly how to make me feel better. I also cheered her up. She had just moved to Oklahoma and when she said the town name I said, you may have to deal with tornadoes every week in Spring. \n\nShe started improving her situation by finding a new job that paid six digits. Weeks before she said she would never find a place to work again but I knew it would work out for her. We were both science nerds. We would flirt but keep it PG. She was traditional and I respected that. I loved that she never used makeup. I told her, you don't need it. She lost weight which also helped her gain confidence that was needed to find a new job. They paid so much in her field because she worked in a STEM field. She lived far away but I started falling for her. In 2013 she gradually started to become more distant. We went from talking every night to most nights to some nights to only a few nights a week. Eventually we talked only once a week or less. I was losing her.\n\nIn May the town was hit by a huge tornado. It destroyed half the town and when I saw it on the news I panicked texting her just wanting to know she was okay. It turns out she was at work which was to the north of the tornado. She also only had minor damage to her house while up the street houses were wiped off of their foundations. She didn't think it was a big deal. I think it was but she was moving on with her life. She had her new job and talked about guys approaching her. After a couple more months of growing more distant, she ghosted on me. \n\nThis hurt because there was no rejection. I can only assume what happened was that she replaced me with a superior guy. She was far more intelligent than I am and I thought it was so attractive. The fist time we exchanged pictures she was saying she was ugly and the picture I got was of this very attractive woman. Sure, she wasn't conventionally attractive but I thought she was beautiful. I joked, are you trying to catfish me because my pickup lines are cheesy. She said I was attractive. I thought I had a chance with her. She would be my last oneitis. After her, I told myself no more long distance relationships. \n\nThe news is talking about a very high risk for tornadoes in her town and the first thing I thought of was her. Six years later I'm sure she has settled down with a boyfriend. I made the mistake of thinking I had a chance. It was the last time I made that mistake and wouldn't let myself think that again. \n\nI know outsiders will accuse me of being an entitled nice guy incel who thought she owed me sex because I was nice to her. She didn't owe me anything. I just fell for her. Assuming she still lives there I hope she stays safe tomorrow. \n\nI was never more than a phase to the women I had feelings for. Even friends both men and women grew out of being my friend. They moved on with their lives and I didn't. \n\nTl;dr: I think about my former oneitis when a town in Oklahoma is mentioned leading to memories of her.", "subreddit": "ForeverAlone"}

{"post_id": "bqssri", "created_utc": 1558340288, "title": "PRACTICAL ADVICE on feeling less lonely", "author": "uhhmynamajeffxd", "self_text": "So I've only recently recognised that the reason I've been getting really sad on and off over the past few years is that I feel lonely, so now that I've recognised that I've been working at trying to feel less lonely and this is what has been working for me. I thought maybe this could help someone else too. \n\nI think it's important to recognise that a partner might not be the antidote to loneliness and for me it wasn't, I still felt incredibly lonely the minute I wasn't with them, so there were other problems that were causing my loneliness, not just the fact that I was single.\n\nI understand that for some people this advice is impossible to follow or won't work at all, but I think for most people at least some of it is doable and might help them. So even if I help one person, this was worth posting. :)\n\n#1 - every morning and night think of at least 5 people you're grateful for\n\nThis is normally like my parents or friends but its also stupid stuff like \"people who made this blanket\" \"guy who invented the shower\". I think it puts into perspective all the contributions of other people to my life. Gratitude is also proven to be helpful for happiness. Normal gratitude lists can just be 'things' that you're grateful for, but I think thinking in terms of 'people' makes you feel less lonely.\n\n#2 - don't listen to sad romantic music\n\nI realised that I used to constantly listen to sad music or music about love, which was constantly putting me in a sad mood or making me focusing on what I don't have. When instead, I now listen to happier more upbeat music which puts me in a good mood, and I avoid music about relationships and love as that reminds of what I don't have. I think it's important to focus on what you have for happiness.\n\n#3 - unfollow anyone who posts about their relationships on social media\n\nThis is similar to the second point, but my social media feeds were filled with people posting about how much they love their bf/gf, reminding me of what I don't have and making me feel like I'm the only single person in the world. I've also unfollowed people who post pictures of themselves going to clubs very often and similar things that create the illusion that I'm the only one not having fun. Think of it this way, if you follow 365 people who each go clubbing twice a year, that could be 2 clubbing posts every day making you think that everyone is always out having fun but you're sat at home. Now my social media feeds are mainly memes and happy and positive posts.\n\n#4 - Stop watching sad TV shows and movies, and ones that are focused on love\n\nI used to watch a lot of kind of sad dramas and romantic things like that, which again made me feel like romantic love is the only and most important thing in the universe, again making me focus on what I don't have. Now instead I mainly watch comedies which make me feel good and make me feel positive.\n\n#5 - journaling\n\nRumination and wallowing and thinking about how lonely you are is bad for you according to this TedTalk I watched, so journaling is a good way to get those thoughts down and out of your mind so you can go do something else. It's cathartic.\n\n#6 - open up to the people that you do have, be honest, put effort into the relationships that you do have \n\nI never really valued my friendships before and I only really valued romantic relationships, but friendships are very important too. I realised that none of my friends knew me very deeply, and that I tell a lot of white lies to people all the time. I think if no one knows you deeply, you can't be understood, and if you don't feel understood you feel lonely. So now I try and tell my friends how I'm feeling more often and I basically tell my friends that I trust everything, I'm very honest with them. Before if I didn't really have anything to gain from telling someone something personal, I wouldn't tell them. But now I tell my friends even really embarrassing stuff that I previously would have never told anyone. It might seem to not matter, but I think the more people know you, the more you feel understood, the less you feel lonely.\n\n#7 - Find solo hobbies to take up your time\n\nWhen I sat down and thought about what hobbies I have, I realised that there's more stuff I could do that I enjoy. I now read more books, watch philosophy/politics or self improvement videos on YouTube, I bought a keyboard and have started learning to play it, I plan to start playing video games and football again eventually. This stuff takes up your time and stops you ruminating about loneliness. \n \n#8 - Take care of your health\n\nThis one is obvious but eating healthy, getting enough sleep and exercising makes you feel better. \n\n#9 - Meditate thinking about the people that love you\n\nI have stopped doing this now but I did this for a while so it might have helped. Again, focusing on what you have and the reality that you aren't completely alone.\n\nBonus Tip - I'm not sure whether I should put this because I want to reiterate that a partner probably won't make the loneliness disappear, but I think working towards being more attractive and likable might help you in the long run. If you're a man, I have advice in my post history.\n\nTL;DR\n\n#1 - every morning and night think of at least 5 people you're grateful for\n#2 - don't listen to sad romantic music\n#3 - unfollow anyone who posts about their relationships on social media\n#4 - Stop watching sad TV shows and movies, and ones that are focused on love\n#5 - journaling\n#6 - open up to the people that you do have, be honest, put effort into the relationships that you do have \n#7 - Find solo hobbies to take up your time\n#8 - Take care of your health\n#9 - Meditate thinking about the people that love you", "subreddit": "lonely"}

Boy was I surprised when I found out that I was still logged in no this account!  let me tell you what has transpired in my life over this last last year... it wasn't that great. \n\nSo after my last post from this account I did call the suicide hotline, a number of times actually, and that got me through a few days. I only called them when when I was drunk, and for some reason I always got mad that they answered. but it did help me through some of my darker points.\n\nShortly after that I was fired from my job, which i hated, for some BS reason but I was glad to be out of there. I found a new job as a cook which was nice for a bit, but I became complacent  and just lingered there. I'm still at this position right now, and yes I am looking ore a new job. but it is soul crushing.\n\nRight now I am also partly homeless. Every other night I am staying with a friend  and his pregnant girlfriend. when i'm not staying with them I am at a Starbucks for 9 hours, where I am desperately looking for a new job, or at work. Then I am lucky enough to sleep in my car. pissing into a bottle is probably the most humiliating thing I have to do.\n\nI know my friend and his girlfriend are being nice to me, but at the same time I can't help but think that they hate me for taking up room in their house. I can only realistically stay with them for 3 more months till the baby is due. But I know they want me out sooner. I know they hate me. I feel like a leach draining their good graces. \n\nthis is officially the lowest I have ever been in life. If I end it now the world would be off better.

One example is waving at the neighbours when I'm driving home and they're in front of their house. When I'm in a bad state trying to do the same thing is a difficult effort, which tends to lead to an awkward result.\n\nRecently I've been thinking that some social interactions also involve spending energy by projecting it to others. Forcing myself to do the interaction can involve spending energy which I cannot afford because I'm low on that energy, and putting myself into a worse state because of that.\n\nI've had many experiences where being social for a bit with someone causes me to feel bad after. I used to think this was a result of mechanisms for coping with being alone being disrupted. Now I think there is more to it.\n\nThere is an emotional element in human interaction, and I'm becoming more aware of that as I become more aware of my own buried emotions. One thing I'm noticing is that various smalltalk which seems practically useless in terms of information is actually meaningful in terms of emotional expression. When I'm not well enough to do that almost automatically and I make myself do it with significant effort, it seems I'm significantly draining myself in some way. That can cause more negative mental phenomena to arise afterwards and even compromise my ability to function in some ways which would have been easy otherwise.\n\nSometimes I blame myself for not making more efforts like that to reach out to people. But now I see such efforts can be quite costly, and sometimes I simply cannot afford them.\n\nRight now almost certainly the main reason I cannot afford them is because I'm spending a lot of energy on my mother and on coping with being with her. There are some other reasons as well, like that I could be doing more to boost my energy level.\n\nProbably during terrible experiences during childhood and adolescence I kind of gave up on that energy and learned how to function in some habitual ways even when low on that energy.

Even though i hung out with them every break that year they would openly leave me out in discussions and go places without even telling me (it was only a group of 7 at the time). skip foward a year  now grade 9 someone new joins and we all start to gather a common interest... anime. i had alot of knowledge cause i would watch it all the time, they never knew cause im left out of discussions. i thought it was finally my chance but no... my spanish wasnt good enough and it was hard translating, especially with my accent they would still leave me out of convos. (btw this group wasnt in my class so i was still a weird kid during class). i would carry on saying random stuff but my spanish got a bit better and was participating in convos at least a quarter of the time.move on to my current year some of them are in my class however im still left out of convos as the group begins to expand,, dont get me wrong my spanish is ok and i would still talk but  never anything personal just random stuff like piss out a golf ball or shit out a pineapple. ive never had anyone to talk too about my deppression, anxiety, lonliness or how i am and for all know they wont even care.i have never been out with friends outside of school, and am always left out, i cant find a different group as this is the only one who would accept me, i cant find another for my weird reputation. every so often i make one laugh but thats about all do, they literally say right infront of me how they have plans to do something but if i ever confront them about it they change the situation or lie, they all went to see the new detective pikachu movie and i wasnt even invited ( they told me spoilers today) and its not just small things like this they all go to eachothers birthday party and i dont even get a text on mine even though they all know when it is, you cant really forget it cause its on christmas, i dont want a party just to atleast be noticed by them. i finish school this year but cant go into college(english college, i dont want to live in spain) and am looking for work eventhough i look really young for 15, im really scared about what to do when i finish and doubt i will have any actual friends that i could go eat a kebab with or just text. i missed out alot of things if you want to know something just ask. thankyou for reading my first ever reddit post, i  just had to get it off my chest.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nedit: (i missed some things out) spain is extremely racist and ive always been called 'negro' or n\\*\\*\\*\\*\\* and made fun because im the only person of colour, and when i say live in england, my family is quite messed up but in short terms, my mum and dad broke up and i want to live with my dad for study purposes.", "subreddit": "lonely"}

The same girl thats told me if she got a boyfriend her and me would stop talking and hanging out because she doesnt want to talk with her guy friends if she's dating someone... \n\nDespite all of this I keep wasting my time on her.. I'm usually always the one to text or make contact first, its never her. So every time I try to get over her and stop talking to her, every time I think yes maybe I'm finally over her she has to text me out of the blue to vent or complain about something and then she pretends to be so talkative and engaging for the next few days that I'll get trick back into thinking just maybe... and then it goes back to the boring few word text replies after those few days...\n\nEven then I'm always caring and nice to her. I give her advice, i ask her how things turned out or if she got the internship she wanted. I comfort her telling her shes worrying for no reason I know she will get it because she works hard. And no i'm not trying to be that \"nice guy\" that assumes she has to like me because I'm nice to her.. I'm nice to her because I have feelings for her and because thats the type of person I am.. I dont expect anything in return for doing it but I just have to know.. does non of it matter? Does being a decent caring person not mean shit in the face of how you look or who you are from your wealth or status??\n\nShe finally got the internship and today was her first day, she told me a week ago. Knowing her I know shes the type to get nervous so I wanted to wish her good look and hype her up so she wouldnt be worried today so I remembered today was her first day and I set an alarm to get up around 7, because I dont start my job till 11, so I could text her before she left for her new internship so that i could wish her good luck and to go kick some butt. She said \"Thank you!\" but at the end of the day I know I'm still nothing more to her then someone to pass the time...\n\nDoes none of this matter at all? Is it really all about how i look?Does how my personality is or the type of human being i am not matter at all? \n\nI know it sounds like I'm expecting something in return for being nice and stuff but I'm not.. but I just want to believe that being a kind hearted person who thinks about someone else all the time and how they must be feeling, someone who tries to make this other person happy, it must matter in the grand scheme of society if only just a little would it not? \n\nI've talked to 2 other girls in the past too where I thought things where going somewhere and I was the same type of person who would be caring and remember things and do these small sweet sorts of things for them and even they acted ungrateful like it was no big thing coming from someone as ugly as me.

I sat here loopy from medication and realized, I have failed so many times, I should make them into short stories. If I'm not rejected, I'm pathetic in some way. \n\nEpisode 1 is NSFW but I'm keeping it PG. The first time I saw a woman naked who was naked for me and not porn or anything. \n\nI was 24 and was crazy for my first oneitis. One night we were talking although she was slow to reply. I didn't mind since sometimes she was busy. She got on cam for me as she had done lots of times. She would tease me because she knew I had no experience and used that to get me to fall deeper for her. This night, it seemed like she was busy but then got on cam. She told me she was going to get naked for me. Then she did. I was a combination of shocked and thrilled. At 24, I finally saw a woman naked who was naked for me and just me, so I thought. \n\nWhat I assumed was her being busy was actually her on cam with a friend of mine and doing various things for him that was far more than just being naked. After she rejected me, one day he messaged me and told me he felt bad. She also rejected him. He said I have to be honest with you and sent a screenshot of the conversation they were having that night. Her getting naked for me was his idea. He told her, you should give him a thrill. She laughed and said okay. Yes, she did it out of pity and in the middle of what we called cybering with him. \n\nYes, the first time I saw a woman naked was because a friend who she was being sexual with said it would give me a thrill. He also told me I was hardly alone with her doing that. Basically I was just one of lots of guys she would do that with. In order to get them to give her attention she did whatever it took to cause them to orbit her. In my case it didn't take much but she went further with other guys in order to get them to orbit her. While he was also rejected, he ended up getting back with his girlfriend. I can't explain how pathetic I felt. My biggest success to that point with a woman was out of pity. \n\nSince I always have been extroverted, I have lots of stories to tell of my failing to escape FA. I've told some but there are lots of others mostly from my 20's where I failed to escape FA. \n\nTune in next time for Anotherguy's True FA Stories.", "subreddit": "ForeverAlone"}

I went through 7 semesters of college without making any friends and barely improving my skills despite my hard work and dedication. I saw that some students that have similar skills had the favor of the professors, I don't understand why, one could say that they were more charismatic but I suspect that it also had something to do with my stature. Some of those professors even helped some of my classmates to get jobs, some of them are still working in those jobs, 5 years later.

I haven't any friends (excluding the one that'll be leaving me after next year), and after highschool, I have no idea how I'll be able to move out.

He's been living with my mother and I and all that for less than a year since he graduated, and everybody is already disappointed and angry with him. I wouldn't be able to handle that. Anyways, loneliness. I'm scared of being alone, which is ironic, because I am 90% of the time. I feel as though my appearance and personality will only ever keep anybody from loving me. I want to be able to give my love to somebody. I feel as though the love I have to hold inside of myself turns into self-hate and depression. I have so much love to give, but nobody to give it to. And, no. I don't count. Self love is a separate topic. Anyways, I'm terrified of being alone my whole life. I want to be able to have one or two kids that I can give the life that my parents never gave to me. I want a wife that loves me for me, and likes the same stuff as I do.

Not to mention I have almost zero clue what I wanna do with my life, besides music or literature, but I won't have enough time to become good enough to make it a profession, and I hate school and it really isn't my thing, so there's that. I don't know. I just feel like my odd likes, wants, and needs make it nearly impossible for anybody to love me. I have a good feeling I'll die alone.

I have one true friend, who is going in the air force for years after highschool mind you, and my family, but my family isn't the most understanding group of people. Anyways, I haven't a girlfriend. I haven't any friends (excluding the one that'll be leaving me after next year), and after highschool, I have no idea how I'll be able to move out. You may ask \"Why move out so soon?\" Well, my older brother, Devon, is having a bit of a crisis in the sense that he suddenly found out that what he was going to college for wasn't his passion, and he dropped out. He's been living with my mother and I and all that for less than a year since he graduated, and everybody is already disappointed and angry with him. I wouldn't be able to handle that. Anyways, loneliness. I'm scared of being alone, which is ironic, because I am 90% of the time. I feel as though my appearance and personality will only ever keep anybody from loving me. I want to be able to give my love to somebody. I feel as though the love I have to hold inside of myself turns into self-hate and depression. I have so much love to give, but nobody to give it to. And, no. I don't count. Self love is a separate topic. Anyways, I'm terrified of being alone my whole life. I want to be able to have one or two kids that I can give the life that my parents never gave to me. I want a wife that loves me for me, and likes the same stuff as I do. I'm not revolutionary in my wants, I feel as though this is very standard stuff. However, the chance of me dying alone seems greater than the chance of me actually finding my \"true love\". I'm just too different. Most people my age all juul, smoke weed, are obsessed with rap, have different tastes in style, love playing sports, etc. Of course, that's just a generalized description, but I'm not overestimating when I say that. And me? I hate juuls, I hate drugs and most people who do them (for personal reasons), I hate rap (unless it's classic rap, though there are some exceptions), the taste in styles is self-explanatory, and I'm not a sports guy. I write fucking music and literature for Christ's sake. I play video games and listen to vinyl records. I listen to music like The Beatles and A Day to Remember and Bing Crosby. I'm ultra sensitive too, and my shitty childhood has given me a decent amount of baggage. Who the hell would love such a damn sissy? Not to mention I have almost zero clue what I wanna do with my life, besides music or literature, but I won't have enough time to become good enough to make it a profession, and I hate school and it really isn't my thing, so there's that. I don't know. I just feel like my odd likes, wants, and needs make it nearly impossible for anybody to love me. I have a good feeling I'll die alone. I'll die a lonely, failed musician with more life regrets than anybody under the sun, and I may even die prematurely if I continue like this. I don't know. Sorry for the long, random post.

On top of that my parents were constantly fighting with each other and they didn't ever beleive in me.

In fact I'd even go so far as to say: loneliness - hope = solitude. And solitude is fine. You can get used to solitude, even find joy and happiness. Some of the happiest moments of my life I was completely alone and completely okay with being alone. But if you introduce hope, if there is uncertainty that's when things get difficult. And it doesn't matter how much hope or uncertainty there is either. Because it always hurts eventually. When there is a lot of hope you just have that much further to be let down. Because the sparkle always leaves someone's eyes doesn't it? The hardness replaces it and already you can feel the magic dimming. Another potential life vanishes into smoke. And when there is almost no hope that is when you are at your lowest because no matter the circumstances you always think it's your fault the hope is gone. Maybe you should have been more this or less that. Shouldn't have had such high hopes, should have played your cards differently, should have lost weight should have worked out more, should have waited, should have spoke sooner, shouldn't have said so much, should have said more... endless recriminations for endless varieties of loneliness. I am not just talking about romantic loneliness here after all. I am talking about intelectual loneliness, spiritual loneliness, familial loneliness, sexual loneliness. All the feelings you wish you could share in all the relationships in your life all the pregnant silences and the yawning abyss of irrelevance... It is only painful because of the hope. Hope is like oxygen. Alone it is intoxicating, corrosive, explosive. It has to be mixed in with other stuff. Loneliness is just a poor admixture of hope and circumstance. And I think some people... the anguish makes them mean or sad or crazy.  Like George Carlin: \"Fuck hope\". Like cynics and anybody that has given up: 'Is this a test? It has to be, otherwise I can't go on'. Maybe like me someday. I don't think I am crazy (although, allegedly crazy people never do). Nor am I bitter or cynical. And I haven't given up.  I am going to try and understand.  I accept my loneliness. Perhaps it is my brains way of guiding me? I accept and am grateful for my relationships. All of them, even the painful ones. I don't blame anybody.  It isn't anybody's fault I feel lonely. Not even mine for having hope. But I have to admit a slight irritation at the thing with feathers. Whether I can finally let it free because I don't need it anymore, or it dies from malnutrition, or simply chooses to cease its squawking when I am trying to sleep... I don't care as much.

We hit it off and made plans to go on a date. We agreed on a coffee shop. \n\nThe day comes and the date is planned for early afternoon since the time worked for both of us. I am almost to the coffee shop when I get a text from her saying she overslept and had to reschedule the date. Since I was naive at the time, I didn't think that if she truly wanted to meet me, she wouldn't have flaked on me at the last minute. \n\nA few days later we agree to meet at another coffee shop, then take a walk in a park. The day before the date she started acting weird asking if the park is usually crowded. I said it was since it was a very popular park. Maybe she thought I was a predator or had a bad experience. I didn't have a problem with it. \n\nThe day comes and I go to the coffee shop at the time we agreed to meet. I sit down and wait because she wasn't there yet. I assume she was running late. That was okay. I didn't realize it was over for me because I was still naive. I sat there for 30 minutes then texted her asking her where she was. No reply. Another 30 minutes pass and no reply. I realize I've been stood up, finish my coffee, and walk out to go home. It hurt being stood up but at least the trip home wasn't far. \n\nThat night I go on the dating site and she's on. I wanted to message her asking her why she stood me up but I didn't want to be creepy so I didn't. I'm sure she met someone else who was probably better looking and had more to offer. The first time she flaked on me I should have taken the hint that she didn't want to meet me. She just didn't know how to say no. The 2nd time she probably blocked my phone number and already moved on. I wouldn't be surprised if she did have a date that day, with another guy that was superior to me. \n\nWhile some people will say it was her loss, it wasn't her loss. I bet she probably met a guy or guys on there and had fun. Maybe she found a boyfriend on there or even a FWB. How was it her loss when I was the one sitting alone being stood up while she probably was having fun with another guy? \n\nI learned that, if someone wants to meet you, they will find a way. Even if she overslept that day, she would have said, I will be late but she would have met me. Once someone flakes on you once, you should never make plans with that person again because they probably have no interest in meeting you. People tell me at least I got dates but most of the time they flaked. It's one thing to flake because at least the other person can turn around and go home. It's another to stand someone else up. People can defend standing up. I think it's inexcusable. I'm lucky it just was a coffee shop. Imagine going to a nice place for dinner and being stood up. At the time I was barely getting by and honestly couldn't afford to date so I tried to meet at places like coffee shops for the first date. I never got past the first date but at least I didn't have to spend that much money there. \n\nStay tuned for episode 3.", "subreddit": "ForeverAlone"}

I have fell in love only twice in my entire life which isn't long because I'm 18 male gonna be 19 in october. And I've been with 5 girls only 2 I actually fell for. And I guess I'm just destined to be alone for the rest of my life so this is to whomever I end up with next and if I show you this, it means I trust you whole heartedly. Which isn't easy for me to truly do because I've been done wrong so often not just by girls, friends and most my family as well. And I only am insistent on finding someone for me is because I guess. I want love because my parents didn't show me nearly enough. They made me question my own existence from a very young age. They are trying now that I'm older but they deny the memories of what happened in particular on my 6th birthday but they remember it. Because something involving my neck happened that day and since then when I act out or defy them they've always avoided touching or grabbing my neck. Back to whoever I'm currently seeing and showed this to just know I mean it whatever I say because I was showed alot of bad in my life but I was never one to lie. Because I know what it's like to be lied to. So if I ever become distant I'm just having a day where all the bad comes back into my head and I don't want to say or do anything to harm you so I isolate myself emotionally and psychically. Because more people can lie to me leave me for someone else but I won't ever inflict what I've been through to anyone because I can't hurt anyone like that and I don't want you to know what it feels like to be inside my head. Everyone who's tried to get into my head gets ruined and blames me for it because they guilt me into being open about myself and my struggles. But honestly with whomever you maybe I don't feel the need to do so any longer, because I can only hope you understand where I'm coming from as a person and your significant other. I care too much to ruin anyone else no matter how bad it ends or the things said.\n        This ends my discussion just wanted to let anyone here know, I'm not here because I feel lonely but because I know what it is to be alone and to feel it constantly.", "subreddit": "lonely"}

I began it always with hatred and ended it with moral subjugation, and afterwards I never knew what to do with the subjugated object. And what is there to wonder at in that, since I had succeeded in so corrupting myself, since I was so out of touch with \"real life,\" as to have actually thought of reproaching her, and putting her to shame for having come to me to hear \"fine sentiments\"; and did not even guess that she had come not to hear fine sentiments, but to love me, because to a woman all reformation, all salvation from any sort of ruin, and all moral renewal is included in love and can only show itself in that form.\n\nI fear mine (and probably many others) loneliness is borne out of the impossibility of completely emotionally captivating someone, of making them bend to your will just to please you, just as you would do to them. You read all these fantastical stories in literature like Dante and Beatrice, Werther Charlotte and Albert, and so on, wondering why people don\u2019t do the same for you. In all my dreams of escape there is no general understanding between me and my partner, the kind of sorts id truly call love, instead the roles are reversed and it is the girl that is desperate for my love, and I hide it only to make her want it more, ever so often indulging her in a kiss or a compliment.

We were in the same track group training together. She's been in my group for almost 2 years and I never paid much attention to her and we almost never spoke. I thought she was kinda pretty but I wasn't really attracted to her.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**TL;DR** had 5 wonderful training sessions I had with a girl last July who then left and I never saw her again. She now dates the biggest douchebag. And from time to time I still think about her.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThen it all started to change when I was timing a long run and she came to me and grabbed my hand and turned it to see the time. Later that day when coach was talking to us, she put her arm around me and called me her new friend.\n\nWhen she grabbed my hand she really shocked me. It surprised and reminded me of how small female hands are. The whole experience was very unusual but I liked it. Over the next practices she pushed me a couple of times from behind as a joke and said ''let's go''. We spent a few more practices together but still I wasn't really into her. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThen summer came and one day I just saw her in a whole new light. Coach said we'd be together again and said ''something..something...she's pretty'' and I thought to myself ''yeah she's alright'' but that day I really started to like her.\n\nWe talked, we laughed, she also initiated most conversations. She used to look me straight in the eyes with the most beautiful smile.\n\nThe next two days we also trained together. I was falling further and further. \n\nThen she was gone for about 2 weeks. One of the longest 2 weeks of my life. Every practice session I was just waiting for her to come.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThen she finally came one practice in the beginning of July and you can only imagine my happiness when I saw her and she spoke to me. It was a beautiful summer day, no clouds, the sun was shining brighter than ever and she came and sat in front of me and a little to the right and just hit me with a stare and a smile. I looked back and smiled. Those seconds that we stared in each other's eyes felt like something I've never felt before. I could never back out when staring into her eyes. She asks me something along the lines ''why are so happy?'' or maybe she just asked me ''what? :)'' I don't remember cleary. Either way I should have told her that I was happy to be with her. 'With her' as in that moment in space and time to be physically there not 'with her' as her boyfriend which I was not.\n\nI remember seeing her for the last time. I said to her ''see you, I hope sooner than 2 weeks'' and I'm not sure what she replied. I think she said that maybe she'll be back in a month. I remember seeing her walk away for the last time.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI was just preparing to ask her out. I added her on facebook and snapchat. Sent a few snaps and a comment on story but she never replied.\n\nFor the rest of July, August, September and October she was on my mind both day and night. Everyday I hoped to see her again, hoping she would come. In October I learned that she would not be coming back. I miss one practice, one practice I'm not there and that's the one she comes to say goodbye. It was around then that she also started dating one of the biggest assholes around. Definitely the biggest asshole in our group. She even popped up in my dreams a few times and after each dream I had the lovesick blues for a week.\n\nI'm not sure if she liked me, she was very extroverted and kind of talked and joked with everybody.\n\nTo a guy like me who's never had a girlfriend that was magical. Maybe it's just me and my low self-confidence but no girl has ever been like that to me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWell I dreamt of her last night again. Probably the 3rd 4th or 5th dream of her.

I thought i was actually making friends with the other unkown people and was quite happy about that, but all of sudden my cousin and his friend started whispering to each other and because of my low self-esteem and social anxiety my mind went straight to the thought that they were talking about me, turns out i was right  because a few minutes later my cousin says he wanted to start drinking and asked me when i wanted to go home. I was confused at first because i had no plans the next day and was planning to stay there untill he left, in my head this just proved that no one there wanted me to be around so i reluctantly told him its fine and he can just bring me home now.

This doesn't magically change one day because suddenly you decide to throw caution to the wind one day just because you \"feel sporadic.\" Sure, good for you that you feel confident enough to talk to a girl. It's not bravery that's the problem : **it's our appearances**. It's our mannerisms. It's the way we think, we act, we *WHATEVER* the normies wanna say it is on that particular day. \"It's your personality bro, no wonder why you're alone! You're too toxic!\" \"Nah bro, just hit the gym with me, bro, bench 350 and the bitches will be lining up, bro!\" \"You're too much of a pussy, bro! Take up some manly hobbies, bro!\" \n\n\n\n\n\n\nTruth be told, even the normies themselves don't know why we're alone. They try to justify it any which way they want in their delusional minds, but at the end of the day it doesn't stop girls from denying people like me, and you, and everyone else on here. Most of us wouldn't even be able to get the time of day from the opposite sex. \n\n\n\n\nThe whole point of this post is **not** \"give up.\" It may sound like it, but what I'm trying to convey is it's literally madness to continue doing the same thing daily and expecting different results. You can spin it any way you want : Get a new haircut, hit the gym, see a shrink, get bone extension surgery, get **plastic** surgery, it's all going to amount to the same thing : failure. \n\n\n\n\n\nMaybe not for you personally, as if I had the pain tolerance and money needed for bone extensions you bet your ass I'd be on the operating table tonight and immediately follow up with lasik. At the end of the day, it'd make me feel more comfortable in my own skin and quite frankly that's all we got in this world. Maybe that'd give us some fucking confidence for once? \n\n\n\n\n\n*Probably not.* People are as good as tearing down as they are at building up, but only the former of the two are they less reluctant to give out. Hell, I could even go as far to say **eager** to give out. \n\n\n\n\n\nOn another note, though, the more I talk to normies about relationships the more hesitant I am to actively pursue something I couldn't get. They talk as if cheating is not only a normal thing in the dating world, but **encouraged**. A rebuke is followed up with \"as if *you'd* know what dating is like.\" \n\n\n\nThey're right\n\n\n\n... Yet oh-so wrong \n\n\n\n\n\n**WE'RE** the kinds of people that wouldn't cheat if we were given the opportunity to be in a relationship. Yet we're left out. \n\n\n\n\n\nDo normal people *want* to be abused in relationships? Mistreated, cheated on? Fine. Don't go for the people that are pure at heart, willing to give nothing but their love. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor the record though, I'd like to state : I am **NOT** one of those people that are \"pure at heart\" and \"blameless.\" Matter of fact if anyone here is worthy of this fate, it's me. I don't wanna get too deep into it but the point I'm trying to make in this post still stands  \n\n\n\n**TL;DR** : y'all are nucki'n futs to work against fate", "subreddit": "ForeverAlone"}

My self-esteem was going up because I thought by getting into better shape, part of me thought it would help with trying to attract women. I left the gym and went to a coffee shop I always went to after the gym for a protein shake. I walked in and the barista who I see a lot was there. I usually made small talk with her but would not even think of flirting with her. \n\nI go to sit down to drink my protein shake when a contractor who had been doing some work on my house walks in and says hi to me, then gets something for himself. He talked very loud and he said I saw you with a woman the other week. It was a failed first date and he told me how attractive she was. I told him it was a first date and she rejected me. He said how I shouldn't have trouble finding women. I told him I did have trouble finding women which was a mistake. He asked her who her ideal guy was and obviously it wasn't me. I actually didn't have any interest in the barista because I would never flirt with a woman who was at her job. He goes up to her and says, what about anotherguy. He's a nice guy. Of all the things he can come up with to compliment me on, all he could come up with is that I was nice. The barista gave me this look. You know that look. Some unattractive FA'ers know that look. It was a mixture of surprise and disgust. I knew what it meant and was okay with her not being interested in me because she had a boyfriend. She immediately responded with I have a boyfriend. I know she was being honest because almost every time I talked to her, she brought up her boyfriend. It wasn't the boyfriend that hurt me. It was that look. Despite being in good physical shape, I was still short and unattractive. It was that look that hurt me.\n\nIt sounds stupid to use this as an example of being FA since she had a boyfriend but the contractor trying to be a wingman for me made it worse. She thought I had told him to do that. On my way out she was still giving me that disgusted look when I apologized to her and told her I respected her having a boyfriend and he tried to wingman for me without me asking him. She accepted the apology and we moved on. It only lasted a few minutes but that look she gave me after the contractor told him I was single is something I have gotten lots of times. If you haven't gotten that look, this will sound dumb but if you have, you know what I'm talking about. I know I wasn't entitled to her being my girlfriend because I know some people will assume that. It's the fact I worked out at the gym for months and it didn't change anything. I was still short and ugly. \n\nHave any of you gotten that look? I know it's a dumb story but I remember how embarrassed it made me feel.", "subreddit": "ForeverAlone"}

Since my high school was very far from home, then that means that I had to stay in a dormitory for my high school life. So, that means that communication with my family was more limited, but this does not mean that there is no communication at all.\n\nAt that time, the whole family would ask me how I am doing and everything, but things got worse when I reached Grade 9. When I try to jokingly tease my siblings about stuff, they would always say that I am a \"piss off\" and such. I would also think the same of my father who would make a lot of prejudicial side comments about stuff that I do not really care about.\n\nFor instance, when I said that I had a roommate who had a prom date, he said that he was surprised because he did not expect someone from the province to have one.\n\nThis honestly hurted me, because that was just a very good example of prejudice. I mean, just because someone is from the province does not ruin his/her chance of getting a prom date, right?\n\nSo, I had to try to get this idea to the head of my father, which did not work out really well. He also called me \"disrespectful\" in the process, which was really offensive in my side since that implied that he was treating me as an inferior, which leads me to the next point.\n\nThere are so many instances when my parents would demand respect just because they were my parents. To be honest, I do not see respect the same way. For me, respect is gained, not demanded. So, of course I will not just simply give in to what they think about things. I will always have to defend the objective, as an equally human being.\n\nThis meant that when I see that I am being treated unfairly, then that would mean that I will have to defend my side until the last of my voice. But unfortunately, these biological parents of mine just think that I am disrespectful, thus inferior.\n\nThe problem does not only root from my parents. My siblings are also alienating me. To be honest, my siblings are the major cause of this alienation of mine.\n\nRemember when I said that I argue with my parents? There are times when my sister will butt in and say that I am the one who is in the wrong side, even if I know for sure that I have no bad intentions. Then that would mean that I have to defend myself from my sister too, which is just too much for me. And as expected, until now, things have not worked out with her.\n\nFor my brother, it is really hard to talk to him. This is because when you try to do talk to him, he will throw a tantrum almost immediately. When I try to have fun with him, he will throw another tantrum. It is like whenever I act that involves him, he will always throw a tantrum. It is just so annoying, honestly.\n\nI would also point out where my family goes wrong. What I am pointing out is how they would act unprofessionally towards other people, and raise their voice all the time. So, when I tell them about this, they will always say that they are not doing such a thing, or they will make up bullshit to defend themselves. Or even curse out of nowhere.\n\nIn the end, I feel lonely whenever I'm with my family. Besides the fact that I barely interact with them now, when I do, it always does not end well for anyone.\n\nSomeone just adopt me please.", "subreddit": "lonely"}

No amount of touching or shared conversation makes me more attracted to them. I feel bad but I cannot be with someone who I can\u2019t give honest answers too.\n\nThe people I want, don\u2019t want me back. So many times they put it in my head that they might be interested or attracted to me, but then change their behavior and I feel so fucking stupid.\n\nI have few places to meet single people and even if I do it doesn\u2019t matter. They are either not into me, or I\u2019m not into them. I have absolutely NO IDEA what to do anymore. I don\u2019t want to care about love and sex anymore. But it has stayed in me like a thirst that\u2019s never quenched\n\nNo amount of hobbies or sexy outfits has made a difference in developing any of connection with someone for the long term or physical affection. I can\u2019t remember the last time a guy asked me for my phone number, to go out, or anything that shows they wanna see me alone. \n\nMy best friend just got engaged to her BF of 6 years. That is her 3rd relationship since high school (we are 29 now). I actually feel very happy for them because I love her, she\u2019s my best friend, and I didn\u2019t cry or feel bad about myself for not being in the same place. She would do the same for me (after all, that\u2019s what I want for myself, she would be happy for me). \n\nBut I know eventually that feeling will creep over the next year until the wedding. It\u2019s so hard to accept yourself and your inexperience when everyone around you has been doing this since they were 16.  Nobody understands that except people who have always been single and never had sex (sex from attraction, not sex that you had to pay for).  \n\nI live in a very expensive area because my family and relatives all live here. Without them and my friends I have nothing i care about, so it\u2019s not in my desire to move (plus I love the climate where I live). Renting with roommates starts around $800- 1000 for one room . My wage has covered that comfortably before, but in the long run, i don\u2019t want to have roommates forever - the uncertainty of roommates actually staying and paying is risky and very inconvenient. That\u2019s why I live at home with parents again. But I don\u2019t wanna life with them much longer or forever either because I don\u2019t get to be my true independent self around them. I want privacy. But I can\u2019t afford my own place, I would go broke! I\u2019m saving as much as I can. But even then I\u2019ve been home alone many times and I hate having the house to myself. I want someone to live with! I want a partner who will move around with me instead of me having to fend for myself because I\u2019m alone. I don\u2019t care how co dependent that sounds, I\u2019m getting older, and I want to have a family. All these uncertain financial obstacles will just make being forever alone even harder. \n\nMost of all, I just wish the universe would just stop fucking with me. I wish it would just stop sending me people to like altogether. It never matters if I\u2019m optimistic and try to have hope and be patient. I can\u2019t handle this anymore. But there is nothing I can DO. I don\u2019t want to accept my situation. I don\u2019t have something wrong with me. I may have thought that before but fuck that. I know exactly what I want and what I can contribute. You can\u2019t make someone desire you though. That\u2019s what I want. I want the person I desire to desire me back. all the specifics don\u2019t matter. We have to enjoy each other\u2019s company and care about each other. But I have NO IDEA how other people are able to get to that point and I\u2019m not. It makes me feel stupid, naive, and inferior. I do like myself. I think I\u2019m awesome. It\u2019s the failure to develop any kind of romantic + sexual relationship that has twisted my mind to believe I\u2019m worthless. But that\u2019s not true. Validation, at least a huge portion of it, does come from others. It comes from love and affection. It comes from honest feelings and sharing those honest feelings. And having those honest feelings be reciprocated.\n\nI so badly want to be in love. But this world has shown me I am not allowed that privilege. I now have to live every day of my life like I have the past 29, which is the expectation that I will be alone today, the next day, and the day after that. The moment I feel any attraction toward someone I have to get rid of immediately or I will suffer. Isn\u2019t that sad? I am suffering because I\u2019m caring about another person.

Let's call him, Tom. Tom and I have become good friends. One night he talked about how 3 girls at our job have flirted with him or asked him out. He also went on a date with another girl that works here. \n\nThen there's me. Told one of my co-workers, \"We should hang out sometime.\" I just get a, \"Yeah, maybe.\" I asked out another co-worker, she laughed and thought I was joking. Work used to distract me from relationships but now that's all I see and hear. It sucks being the only guy at work that's never even kissed a woman. I feel like the biggest fucking loser. I just want to know what it feels like to be seen as attractive. I'm just seen as the \"funny guy\".", "subreddit": "ForeverAlone"}

So pretty much I guess I just want to be wanted. I'm 18, male, in good shape, and decent looking.

So recently in an attempt to get some attention (for lack of better words), I created an \"AdultFriendFinder\" account; I'd ALWAYS see ads for it on porn sites and stuff so I decided what the hell, maybe it's worth a shot. But the only people I seem to get in contact with are fakes/bots and older men thinking I'm a twink. I'm not even sure if this is the right place to ask, but is there a place online where I could go to get like real affirmations from real people? Considering AFF is supposedly the \"biggest\" site for that kind of stuff, I thought I'd have some luck but the more I try, the more I just feel alone and it kinda just really bums me out.

I forget who sent the initial message but we hit it off. We started flirting and less than a week after the initial message, we were making plans to meet. She kept telling me how attractive I was and even sent me topless pictures. While she wasn't conventionally attractive, her personality is what mattered to me. Her combination of being funny and flirty got me to like her. We were close in age. I was in my late 20's while she was in her mid 20's so the lack of an age gap made it more comfortable for me. \n\nWe plan on meeting the next day. We flirted about what we were going to do to each other. It was more of a hookup than a long term relationship but I was finally going to lose my virginity. I never told her just to make sure it wouldn't cause her to ghost on me because that's what happened when I was stupid enough to admit to a woman I was a virgin. \n\nThe day comes and I text her saying I was leaving soon and couldn't wait to meet her. She doesn't reply. I cancel my plans to go meet her because it seemed like she had flaked on me. \n\nThe next day she texts me that she was in the hospital. I was disturbed but relieved because she said it was nothing too serious and she still wanted to meet me. That night we were flirting with each other and she stopped replying. I thought maybe she fell asleep. The next day, she didn't reply. I never got a reply from her again. \n\nA couple of weeks later I noticed she was back on the dating site. I worked up the nerve to ask her why she stopped talking to me. It may have been creepy but I had to know because we were literally in the middle of a conversation and I hadn't said anything that would be the cause of someone ghosting me. She never replied and I had to move on.\n\nWhat hurt about that is how sudden it was. The second time she ghosted me in the middle of a conversation. Obviously I thought she made the hospital thing up. It was an odd way to flake on someone because it was weird to do to someone. Maybe she really was in the hospital. A couple weeks later I stumbled on her profile again although I wasn't stalking her. It was one of the top profiles on my search list. In one of the pictures there was an infant that couldn't have been more than a few months old. She changed her status from didn't have kids to had kids. Since it was going to be a hookup, it wouldn't have bothered me if she told me she had kids. \n\nHaving years to think about it, I think she was still in a relationship and they were having problems. She used me to help her self-esteem. She never planned on meeting me. I still don't know why she ghosted on me in the middle of a conversation. She was being just as flirty as me so it couldn't have been that. She knew what I looked like and called me attractive so it wasn't looks that was my main cause of being rejected. \n\nIn two days I went from not just thinking but knowing I was finally going to lose my virginity to ghosted. \n\nHas something as weird as this happened to any of you?", "subreddit": "ForeverAlone"}

{"post_id": "bsd5br", "created_utc": 1558676276, "title": "I'm here in the Woods", "author": "1Peri-Pathetic1", "self_text": "I don't remember to start having friends until my mid-teen years. Throughout my childhood, I always felt lonely; trying so desperately to reach out to people and feeling anxious about being considered their friend. And of course, being severely bullied. I hated it and never got used to it. It just became an usual thing for me, trying so hard to be friends with other people.\nWhen I turned 16 is when I truly started socializing, but I always felt otreticious, like an extra, like an intruder. I never got to be part of a clique, a specific group of friends, or simply people I could have the initiative to reach out to. I think it is perhaps because of my rare interests and how I wasn't into other people's ones. At that time, I embraced that attitude and behaved as so, for the need. I was able to talk and socialize with everyone, but not able to be part of them. I use the analogy of having a citizenship in every country but without actually being from one, to explain it better. \nThe problem is that I never understood why. To this day I don't have a reason or explanation as to why I've been living like this since forever. I have been the weird kid all my life. But I don't think that I'm different from anyone, I'm just a regular dude. I always looked for an excuse for this behavior. Maybe I had different interests or hobbies, maybe I was difficult to conversate to, maybe I'm simply a different type of person, etc. It was dumb to think this way, but I really wanted to know why most people and other kids didn't like me.\nEntering high school was better, I was new and most students too. I became part of a close circle of friends, but didn't know how to act. And I don't know if anyone can relate to this but, I'm kind of naturally bulliable. This friends really just met me and made fun of me a lot. Up to the point where I almost felt like a clown and doubted if they actually liked me around. They hungout way more without me. They were close with each other but I don't think I did with them fully. I really, really, really liked them though. Perhaps I was also weird to them. \nWhen I was younger, I used to go to the woods whenever I felt lonely or sad. There is a forest nearby my house and my old middle school. I remember those memories with warmth and happiness. Exploring by myself and just wandering around, me and my thoughts, listening to music. Later I played a game with myself that consisted on getting lost and trying to find a way out. I went so much there that now I know every corner and spot. It is a very special place for me.\nBut as I said, I began high school and stopped going. It demanded more time and I went out more, socializing as much as I could, thinking that things were getting better. Nevertheless, it never felt like it. My closest and mutual friends from middle school still hungout with me, but I was never a person for them to invite to parties or places. Neither was I someone to invite them to parties or places, because where could I get them to and with whom. It's almost like if it was a curse, not letting me to just be someone who fitted in.\nI had a crush on a very friendly and beautiful girl. I didn't improve that situation and I have to admit that I never tried to flirt with her. I didn't want to, I liked being his friend; but I seriously liked her and admired her. Anyways, a friend of mine got to know and told me truthfully that, she had said several times that I am a weird guy. Just that, weird. I didn't make it a big deal, but it stuck with me. Why? What was it that she felt like that? What made me so weird that even if I truly tried for it to stop, still prevailed? Do I just can't fit in?\nA month later I felt so bad that I went back to the woods once. At the night, dark, alone, I started to cry, realizing how bad in a situation I was. I realized how I never got to be close with someone, how I never got to spend time with my friends, how I never went to parties, how I never reached out, and all the stuff I must have missed out in what were supposedly the best times of my life. I realized that night, again, how I never got to be close with anyone. I never had a best friend or something, and I thought that all of these beautiful memories I had growing up in this forest could've been shared with someone. Maybe the memories and moments could've been so much better. Perhaps with someone not so different from me, or someone which each one of us could relate to. I felt so lonely. \nThat night I felt like I had wasted my short life onto trying to get close with other humans. Til this day, I'm still trying to socialize, but I still don't know why do people just avoid me. I wish I had someone here, in my small town, to be close to, and just be there when we needed each other. Someone whom I don't feel awkward with nor when reaching out with. It is very sad. I don't even know what is another purpose to this post than speaking out and expressing this that I feel.\n\nBut well, this will probably get buried. Thank you very much for reading. I hope someone can relate to this and know that they're not alone.", "subreddit": "lonely"}

I have done things on my own for as long as I can remember and I'll make it work until I can't move forward anymore. I can't run anymore, but that doesn't mean you guys can't. Trust me, you know.if you have a way out. And for those that do, take it. Take it and never look back. For those that are like me, our humanity defines us in this moment of true isolation. \n\nI'm willing to carry on. I still know in my heart I gotta hold out. And so do everyone of you. Stay strong, friends. If You ever need to vent, I'm here. \n\nAll the best", "subreddit": "lonely"}

I have a foreign country trip to South America with my history class, and it's for two weeks. The people that I'm going with are terrible and insufferable. They've made it their job to exclude me, among other people at my school.\n \nBut they've done it quietly and subtly, so no one would notice their corrupt actions. I feel shunned and lonely, especially when I see them laughing and talking together. My 16th birthday is on that trip, and it angers me. The trip ends early enough where, if I had friends, I could have had the sweet 16 party I'd always dreamed of. But instead, I'm alone. It feels bad, seeing other girls invite their friends to their sweet 16 parties and going out. \n\nMy mother is sweet and is wanting to buy me a large cake for my \"party\", and she wants me to go on a date, but I know that nothing is going to turn out the way either of us had planned. I'll be doing an internship this summer where there are no people anywhere near my age involved. I couldn't go on a date or make friends if I wanted to. You are supposed to be considered as coming into your own and maturing when you are 16, but I don't feel developed at all. \n\nI'm supposed to be more evolved than this.

Just having a bit of a rough night and I have allot on my mind and finding it really hard to love myself tonight.\n\nWas supposed to go out for drinks tonight but everyone cancelled last minute on me and a few people stopped responding to me entirely.\n\nMy ex who I broke up with recently was friends with everyone I knew and I don't think they wanna affiliate with me after she broke it off so i'm probably gonna stay in tonight. Bit of a bummer because I was planning to go out for a while but yeah. I wanna say I got something positive out of my last relationship but i'm pretty sure I learned nothing good from it at all. \n\nWe where together for 4 months and she moved in with me for a month or so and basically lived at mine. I would look after her constant anxiety, depression, I never could open up about my own anxiety because she would shut me down every time and I didn't want to piss her off. I thought that her anger was just temporary or she was just having a bad day or bad few weeks. Still I would cook for her daily, buy her allot of gifts, do her laundry. I gave all of myself and helped her out anyway I could. I gave her everything. And in the end she broke it off with me and never gave me a real reason why. I feel used in many ways.\n\nThe day before we where literally talking about travelling and how to move our stuff into our new place and the day after she just completely switched when she woke up and started to treat me like a stranger. We met up a few days after we broke up so that she could give me my clothes back and we where talking fine, really enjoying each others company and we where going to go and see a show together. She mentioned she was going through allot of things internally and that's why she treated me like a stranger out the blue but I feel like I never got the real reason why. A day later after we met up, out of nowhere she blocked me on all social media and wouldn't reply to me on Facebook. \n\nI also found her on tinder tonight. When i was in a relationship with her I had to literally argue with her to get her to delete tinder and to stop going on dates with other guys while she was with me so yeah that sucks too. \n\nWorst thing is she was the one that started to call me her boyfriend there would be loads of nights where she would get pissed at me and not talk to me for the whole night just because of the idea that I got with someone. Like just make it up in her own head and just fall asleep in my bed pissed and not talk to me and be aggressive. \n\nThe feeling of being a stranger in your own bed is fucking terrible. But I stuck with her because i believe in sheer loyalty and making things work. It's crazy how you can do so much for someone and they they can turn completely cold to you and treat you like a stranger our of nowhere. Like that shit hurts allot.  \n\nI so dearly want to meet new people but every time I get hurt like this it pushes me more internally and I've been pushed so far inside for so many years that I don't know where to go anymore.  I really want to do better and meet others but its so hard when I've been hurt so many times. \n\nI try my best everyday with no one besides me but it gets hard at times. I know that one day ill meet a girl that really does appreciate me and that when I give all of myself to her, she'll will be worth it and, I look forward to that day. \n\nI just wanna work on myself and go to gym and find a good second job and focus on myself. I know that what I experienced wasn't love. Because someone who loves you wouldn't treat you like that. \n\nI bought myself flowers today.

Those lines don't help. I put myself in your shoes and i know that of course you've tried, of course you've done things you thought would change your fortune. Why wouldn't you have tried, you're a human with a brain, and a human with a brain will try what it thinks will chnage his/her situation. Thats a given. What i see is people who have tried and tried and tried and are still not getting what they want, i can't imagine what that must do to a persons sense of drive and purpose. *I dont understand*\n\nI'm no chad. I've slept with only 2 people, but I've done a lot with those 2. I've developed a form of ocd called 'retrograde jealousy'...my mind taunts me all day with images and movies of my partners past, all the moments she had with bigger dicks etc. The mind when in a state of deep emotional and sentimental bond with a person can become incredibly possessive and uncomfortable with thoughts of someone else enjoying what is \"yours\". Thoughts of the person you hold so dear...receiving pleasure being in a state of total lust with another can be incredibly hard to accept. I broke up with my first and got back together with her years later...and of course she did way more than me when we were apart...cos thats how the world works, its so easy for women (well not all women) to do \"stuff\". At its worst it dominates my mind all day, and i end up crying and screaming by night time. I've tried (halfheartedly) taking my life twice because of the rj. It can be really debilitating and can affect your life in every way.\n\nSo there you have it. I have a problem and so do you. Totally different. I don't understand what your problem is like. I wish you weren't going through what you're going through. I wish i could offer a concrete a solution but like i said the lines are bs. Of course you've tried. If anything you've helped me slightly to live in the moment with her, quieten down the past. Appreciate that what i have and experience at times is what others crave. \n\nAt the end of the day...the universe gives no fucks about both of us. If you disappear right now or if i disappear its all the same to the universe. Universe does not care how many times I've got my dick wet or how many times you haven't. \n\nI wish you a peaceful, content and serene mind in the future. In whatever way that would be possible. I offer no advice or \"lines\", cos that would be undermining your struggle. \n\nAll i can say is you're human like me, and we're both as worthless and worthy as the next human. \n\nGodspeed.", "subreddit": "ForeverAlone"}

I'm also not one of those guys who likes to drink, smoke or party or whatever, but I see everyone doing it whatsoever.\n\nI currently don't have a passion for anything else besides what I do.

This is my first post here, and I'm unsure how good I am at writing something cohesive or good.  \nI just feel so lonely, I have all my life. I've lived in foster care since I was 3. Lived in 4 different families, the one I live in now is the only good one, I've been abused at all others, including by my parents. Both physically and mentally. When I see people being happy with their parents I wonder what it feels to love your parents, or to be loved by them. The last thing my mom said to me was \"Every day, I regret not aborting you\" It still stucks with me. I don't have any close friends, no one I feel like I can open up to talk to. I have chronic depression and anxiety, some days are better than others, but these last few days have been pretty bad, I've had many suicidal thoughts. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI am pretty shy in person, and awkward. Online is the only place where I feel comfortable enough to truly be myself. So to combat the lonliness I have talked ALOT with people online, I have found some girls I have clicked with, but no one in the same country I live in, Sweden. Almost all of these girls have always told me that I am very sweet, caring, funny, cute, smart, and respectful. And I try to be those things, I've always cared way too much about others, I am very compassionate and kind. People seem to open up to me easily, but I've never felt a closer connection to anyone, I have never felt loved by anyone. I just feel desperate for closeness. hugs, cuddles, kisses, whatever. Just as long as I can somehow replace this cold and empty feeling in my chest with some warmness.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI don't have many interests, I mostly sit inside all day, playing video games, listening to music, reading, writing. Or lay in bed. I don't know how to become better, and try to move out of my shell.

Or morning, depending on where you are, dear stranger. How are you?\n\nSo, this is one of those days where I feel like crap for no discernible reason.\n\nTheoretically, I should be fairly content with my life, and there are days when I absolutely am. I'm 31 as of yesterday, I finally have an apartment of my own, a stable job that might not pay amazing, but it's good enough. I've lost a ton of weight recently, about to reinvent my wardrobe and try to better myself by starting to look the part, too. I have a great family that helps out and supports me a lot.\n\nBut I can't help but feel disconnected. I've been single for a long time, it's been over two years since the person I thought then to be the love of my life left me. My mind can't help but wander back to her. She recently moved into my city and found a new partner, and at that point I unfriended her on Facebook because I decided I couldn't bear to look at it. It made me feel miserable. Even though I don't consider myself particularly ugly, I think of myself as somewhat intelligent (albeit maybe a bit on the boring side, as I'm more of the \"read a book, play a game, listen to some music\" type of person), I also have a significant streak of isolationist tendencies. This makes it stupidly difficult to find new people. \n\nMy best friend has gotten married a while back, and we drifted apart as is often natural in such situations. He's a entreprenour now, married, thinking of kids. We've been very close friends for over ten years now, but I can't help but to think I can't relate to him anymore, the depth of the connection just isn't there anymore. We see each other quite rarely, and it's hardly ever him that initiates the contact.\n\nSo, amongst all the adventures in self-betterment, satisfaction from accomplishing my personal goals, which feels great... there's an emptiness I can't fill. I'm working out my self-esteem problems, slowly but surely, try to find new things to like myself for every day, and sometimes even succeed. I'm good at my job, which I enjoy. But it just all feels meaningless today, feels like depression is creeping it's way back bit by bit. I've sent a friend request to my ex again, fully expecting it not to get stuck in limbo, never accepted. Which is probably for the best, as I wouldn't even know what to do with it if it did. I have friends who keep telling me how great of a person I am, but it all feels so fucking hollow and meaningless when you're still stuck being in the same spot for so long.\n\nThat's it, that's all.

You see I was always kind of a romantic but I never had the courage or trust in myself to go ask anyone out (also my confidence was extremely lowered around 5th grade when someone told my crush and the entire rest of the grade I liked her and she was so shocked that the weird kid had a crush on her).\n\nSo flashforward to sophomore year where I've finally met a girl (let's call her Ashley) who I really like and get the chance to ask out..... And turned down.....and ask her out again!!......so I can get turned down again.  All jokes aside though I asked this girl 3 different times all about 2 months apart because I kept getting mixed signals. And don't get the wrong idea Ashley wasn't trying to give me the wrong idea she actually would have said yes if someone else hadn't asked her out like the week before or whatever (and no she's not that kind of girl or anything either she just had allot of dicks asking her out pretending to be nice). But finally right before we left for Christmas break Ashley actually asked me out!! I was so excited of course I said yes and we had a great relationship....... for like 24 days. Eventually she broke up with me because she couldn't see me as more than a friend (which looking back I'm actually glad that happened). Eventually over time me and Ashley became absolute best friends.\n\n\nSo there are going to be 2 new people here \n\n1. John. He's been one of my best friends for years at this point even though he can be kind of annoying\n\n2. Bethany. Bethany lives in Norway and was introduced to me through Snapchat by John \n\nSo while I was sulking still getting over Ashley I began talking to Bethany and began to start having feelings for her.\nEventually I ask out Bethany but she turns me down saying she's already in a long distance relationship with John.  Now at this point John and Ashley are my closest friends even though I still have some feelings for Ashley left over.  I begin to notice John becoming allot more physical with Ashley (nothing sexual just lots of long huggs) which I tell Bethany who asks him about it. I'll skip all the drama with that and just give out some of the plot points\n\n- John turns out to be a major asshole who guilts/manipulates girls into doing sexual things with and then plays the victim then guilts them into staying with him\n- John dates Ashley for like 5 months (before it's discovered just how much of an asshole he is)\n- Ashley gets a restraining order on him (yeah it's that bad)\n\nSo after that I have major trust issues with best friends and find it difficult trusting friends :) yay me.\n\nBut during that time the most amazing thing that has ever happened to me so far in my life happened.\n\nI STARTED DATING BETHANY\n\nThis was the best thing ever and we were so happy and we just felt so right together....... except we were never together. We were on opposite ends of the Atlantic.... and it felt like torture for us both.... She caused without a doubt the happiest point in my life. Now I'll admit our relationship wasn't perfect, we argued a good bit but at the end of the day she was perfect to me and I was perfect to her. And I knew that as long as I had hope of one day moving in together everything would be okay.  \n\nExcept there was one problem with that.... I loved her but if I were to go to Norway I would be leaving my family and my friends and everyone I'd ever met.... For her.... I couldn't do it and neither could she...... So I broke it off..... because I just couldn't handle dating her and knowing we'll never live together. (FYI the round trip price in the cheapest seats on the cheapest plane is 2000$) \n\nSo that marked the end of my happiest time in my life so far...... And started the downward spiral......\n\nI've been pushing away all of my irl best friends subconsciously (including Ashley) because I don't trust them anymore leaving me with the kind of friends who just wanna hang out and have a good time and no friend who will talk / hug you out of a panic attack. I currently have 3 people I feel like I can rely on and none of them live close to me (one of them being Bethany). I've constantly wondered weather I did the right thing breaking up with her making me trust myself less and less. I've been like this for the last 6 months or more\n\nI've been constantly touch starved wanting someone who I haven't pushed away to just hold me and tell me life's going to be okay but no one can do that for me because either they don't care enough about me or they are to far away.\n\nIf you made it this far thank you really I appreciate you reading this mess that I wrote and please show your support because it would mean allot.", "subreddit": "ForeverAlone"}

I was not always the most socially savvy teenager in the world so I was worried at times I might end up that way, but I didn't. This post isn't about me, it's about the man who used to live in the house I currently live in with my family.\n\nI'm in my late twenties. I'm married, two kids, third on the way. I'm lucky enough to have a father generous enough to help me buy me the house we currently live in. It was cheap, though. Far cheaper than the rather nice neighborhood it's situated in would lead you to expect. The reason is, because the house used to be inhabited by what my father described as \"a hermit and a hoarder\". That's all the details I ever had. No more, no less. He became a bit of a mysterious figure in my mind. Until a few months ago...\n\nMy uncle and his wife, who helped us in fixing the house, visited us for dinner. Due to some glitch in the postal system we are still receiving letters meant for the previous owner of the house. My aunt saw one of the envelopes, and she said recognized the name. She double-checked our address and said yes, she really does. I asked her, how come. So she tells us: \"I knew the guy who lived here... oh my God, it's Frank!\"\n\nSo who was Frank? Frank was a lonely guy. He was fairly normal looking. He had a mild form of autism. My aunt was friends with a relative of him. And she visited his house before, years ago, when he was still young. Frank was a socially awkward man. He became increasingly more and more isolated. He bemoanded the fact that he never had a love life. But he was too far gone to do much about it. He stayed inside more and more. Being outside hurt him too much. He became a hoarder, holding on to things that reminded him of his past, because his teenager years of ignorant bliss were somehow a bit better. If only in a bittersweet sort of way.\n\nThe neighborhood consists mainly of married couples, families with children, and a handful of divorced fathers who see their kids on weekends. So Frank got more and more sad every time he ventured outside the house only to be reminded of what he didn't have. That's why he planted the whole garden full of big trees, to block out the world. Inside his house, it was a big mess. He slept on the floor. His mattrass concrete. Ordered all his food and things online from the first moment this was a possibility, and before that, go out to buy only at night or very early to avoid as many people as possible.\n\nYears passed by. Police repeatedly came to the door, after complaints of the smell in the house, worries about fire safety and what-not. One day, he was just... gone. Put his house on the market. Cleaning it out was hard, I heard. Most of it was gone by the time I first set foot in it, although a lot of woodwork had to be replaced and of course every wall (re-)painted (most of it never was).\n\nNow, my aunt told me, Frank had been put in a sort of group home. She felt it was sad because in her eyes he was smart enough to take care of himself and \"not some sort of imbecile\" but he was apparently forced into it, more or less. He's forty-nine but looks far older. Like he's in his sixties already.\n\nMy daughter (4) asked me, who are those letters for that we keep getting? I told her a bit of the story, simplified of course. She seemed to hardly register it at the time, but somehow in her own way she understood as the next day she surprised me by showing me a beautiful drawing she made. I asked her, who is this for? \"It's for the old man that lives in the house, Papa,\" she said. And it broke my heart a little.\n\nI have no idea what to do with the information I now have. Maybe if I looked the guy up he would think it's weird. Maybe he would think it's because I pity him, and he may be too proud and be mad and say he doesn't want pity or some similar reaction. Or maybe, just maybe, he would enjoy it too. I really don't know. But I wish Frank well. I wish all of you well. I hope it gets better. I hope you find someone in life that makes you happy and I wish there wasn't such a stigma and such judgement attached to being lonely.

This meant I couldn't really socialize very well (think literally falling asleep/ being sleepy all day) which meant i was poorly socialized going into college. The real problem was that I had no interests and nothing to bond with people over. I couldn't bond over gaming because I was so socially awkward that I thought people would make fun of me for liking video games.

Even in High School, they would seem to get together outside of school fairly often, I was rarely invited unless I injected myself. Now they rarely strike up a conversation with me. They will still respond and do stuff with me if I invite them, but they don't invite me. This summer break has really opened my eyes. A good chunk of my friend group is going together out of town to do some stuff for a good part of the summer (almost a month!) and didn't invite or tell me about it. I learned about it from a 3rd party. I also suspect they have been getting together already over this summer break, and haven't told me. They are my only friends, but having this happen is really depressing. I love and trust them still, should I be upfront and ask them?

Diabetic (10yrs) but apart from this no diagnosed mental or physical health issues. Both mother and father still married and living together. I'm a big dork tbh lots of video games and anime. I am also very into music. Producing, listening, writing. Piano for 15 years and bass for about 7 or 6.\n\nHeres my life story...\n\nAs an ultra smol kid ( from when i can remember to 12) we lived in switzerland where i attended a german school. I think i felt a real need to prove myself and fit in well so i came off as one of those over enthusiastic kids that just try and impress everyone. Safe to say i was bullied mercilessly for sticking out. Didn't help my appearence wasnt exactly common being asian white mixed and very tall. We eventually moved i suspect because of my failure to settle at school but also perhaps the language barrier was taking a toll on my grades. I do speak german fluently but my written communication was obviously sub par compared to the rest of class. If i had to summarise what impact this period of life had on the development of current me, i would say the bullying made me fear whar people do to those who dont fit in.\n\nFastforward. England, highschool/ year 7 to 11.\n When my first crush broke up with me was when i first observed the start of the things i dont really understand. She broke up with me via text. On the way back from spending the night tagging along with her friends rollerskating i recieved the text and cried all the way home. Cried for approx 1 hr at home and then stopped. It was quite painfull but it felt like very physical. Like someone squeezing my heart and alongside my mind going crazy thinking about what i did, why.etc it was very overwhelming hence - tears. The relationship gave me information on the types of people and cliques that i could work in. It also gave me a glimpse of the very real social heirachy at that age. \n\nSo i decided i would try again with someone more in my clique. That went horribly. She was rude and used me to climb social ladder, putting me down in front of friends and lashing out when i called her out. Safe to say that i decided to end it. I broke up with her. No.2 taught me what i didnt want in a romantic relationship. \n\nFast forward to A levels. (16 - 18). Ive become hyper aware of how i present myself. I enter every conversation having pre thought out possible responses for optimal sitautions. I spent a long time trying to ensure i was as normal seeming as possible. The move to college destroyed any friends i had before. They didnt talk anymore. It was a fresh start. And it was a failure! I met a circle of these music, stoner people i thought were fascinating and cool but i could never get in with them. No matter what i tried. The furthest development in relationship i had with them was as the \"wierd internet anime kid cuz hes asian\" the feeling of alienation was immense. \n\nMy last two years of A levels i spent trying to improve myself, trying to understand what i did wrong and try to become more attractive as a friend. I did this by myself. I had no one i had regular interactions with because the twins went to uni and josh was struggeling with his future. \n\nAt uni finally. A girl approached me from music society and we dated for 6 months. The whole time i knew it was doomed. I feel like a psychopath or im going crazy. I could fake this whole different human for weeks at a time. It was nice to spend time with someone who was obsessed with me but it felt so wrong. I want to stress i didnt treat her bad. I broke up with her a couple weeks ago, had to eject the whole friendship tied to music society. Back to nobody.\n\nCurrent date - i feel so different from everyone and i guess that makes me a snowflake right? I just feel so unconnected to anything or anyone. People i talk to, i can see it in their eyes, i know what tags they're putting on me, what predictions of character they've made of me. I have tried to form lots of anykind of friendship but they all result in me playing a character which prevents me from getting any kind of fulffillment out of talking to them.\n\nEven met this logically perfect girl, pretty, cute, speaks 9 languages, super good at art, super good at music, super smart, also a bit of a stoner so quite grounded as a human - but its all in my head? Theres no feeling, i dont feel anything when we spend all night talking, no feeling when we have intercourse, when shes hugging me and my brian knows it should be good but just nothing.\n\nTL;DR - people dissapoint me immensly, i cant get the friendship/girlfriend buzz anymore and i dont know how to be me.\n\n And honestly: \n\nit makes me sad because I'm lonely.", "subreddit": "lonely"}

The few things that keep me going are my family (or at least a few members of my family), my friend Kieran, my passion for music, and the smallest hope I still have for a better tomorrow. \n\nMy family is self-explanatory. I love my brothers and my mother, as well as my grandparents. My father is a different story, though I don't necessarily hate him or have zero love for him. I'd hate to devastate them by killing myself, despite my brain always telling me they'd just \"get over it\" anyways. Maybe they would, but I dunno. \n\nMy friend, Kieran, is also a reason. He's been there for me for six years. He's done many financial and moral things for me. He's kept me from going on a downward spiral many, many times. And yet, I still treat him like shit because of how bitter and sad I feel all the time. I don't deserve him, I really don't. I love the guy more than he could ever know, he can be more of a brother to me than my actual brothers sometimes. \n\nMusic is self-explanatory. It's what keeps me going. \n\nAnd hope is also self-explanatory, though I question every day on how I still have any hope. That being said, I still really wish I weren't alive. I have things to be thankful for, though they're in short supply. \n\nAnyways, I'm lonely 50% of the time, and the other 50% of the time, I'm just depressed.  There is hardly any room for happiness, if any. Often times, I'll think I'm happy in the moment, just to realize later on that I wasn't. I was merely distracted from the depression and loneliness. \n\nOne of the biggest blows for me is my romantic failure. I haven't a girlfriend, and the few attempts I've made at getting one this year flopped completely. The first girl I tried getting with (of whom I genuinely liked and had a connection too) just ghosted me upon my confession, never acknowledging me since. The second attempt was with my life-long best friend, Emily. And the hardest part about that was the fact that she wanted to date. She did. The only issue was, she's attracted to women, not guys. Despite her best efforts, she couldn't look past that, and I don't blame her. But, still, that hurt. I've always sort of crushed on her a bit, so to get so close to an actually meaningful relationship, just to have it ruined by something out of both of our control was soul crushing. But, I digress. It's absolutely emotionally debilitating being lonesome in this way. I just want to be loved and accepted by somebody who likes me for me, and who likes the same things I do. It may be a lot to ask for, but it hurts being romantically lonesome. It really, really hurts.\n\nAnother factor in it is my constant fear of the future. I want nothing more than to write music for a living, having a loyal fanbase and all that I can share my (mostly horrible) life experiences with, as well as give advice and aid them via the music I create. I do not wish to be wealthy, though I wouldn't dislike that. I just want to earn enough to live off of, as well as buy the things I'd like to buy here and there. However, I have a constant fear that I'll never be able to live that dream out. Skill limitations, time limitations, the way the world works, etc. There are many factors working against me, and it terrifies me to know how possible it is that I'll fail. It almost makes trying not seem worth it. Why try when you know you have a better chance in failing than passing? I obviously don't plan on giving up any time soon, but it terrifies me. It keeps me up at night.\n\nYet another thing that depresses me is loss of innocence/loss of innocence. My shit childhood has to do with that. Whenever I see a pretty girl, or watch an anime, or see a cartoon, etc, I become depressed. Not just any cartoon or anime, but ones that show things like love stories, or coming of age stories, or even simple shit like a kid with a normal life. It's as if I get jealous that I don't have any of that, so it upsets me. And, especially what depresses me, is sexual stuff. If I see, hear, or do anything sexual, I become so, so depressed. I don't know why. It weirds me out too. I just don't get it. You probably don't understand, since I don't even understand which makes articulating it impossible, but I tried. Maybe some of you will understand.\n\nAnd, lastly, the final thing I'll talk about that adds to my anguish (since there are so many) is how ani-social my life has become. I don't have money, nor do I have any friends (besides my one best friend), so I can't get out much. And since I was sheltered most my life, my social skills are goddamn terrible, so meeting new people is a huge struggle for me.

Pretend that the person kept themselves isolated for very... long... periods of time.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis is pretty much me. I attempted to enter a few relationship, so far i've only been turned down a few times(a few days into the date). The ones that ended i was too pushy and i believe that i wasn't aggressive enough. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThen after thinking about love.... i kind of don't feel anything. The word \"love\" means nothing to me anymore, I don't understand love. This chick wanted to hook up with me(i knew her in real life), but i just ghosted her after exchanging text messages. What i would describe as love i only felt like 2-3 times in my whole life (in my mid 20s now). The time that i actually thought \"this is it\" the relationship ended 2-3 weeks later. I didn't do anything crazy, and i was there when she needed me. Then i got a text message saying i was too kind to her. As soon as i came home, i laid in my bed, and it literally felt like something died in me or that something changed. I can't put my finger on it, but something in my head happened.... changed... now i'm a chronic liar(i've always been a liar), now when i lie it's to try to take something even if the process is long. I'll tell a bunch of small lies to plant the picture of the big lie i want them to believe because basically everything means little to nothing to me. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nDuring that school shooting in Colorado, i heard about this chubby kid named Kendrick Castillo, he tossed himself on the shooter and died (and was the only one that died). I thought why? Die being a hero once, when you could have been a hero a hundred times over your entire lifetime. To toss your life away to people who will probably forget about you and don't know really know you is just stupid in my book. I know, i'm an asshole for saying that, but the kid had a lot going for him at 18, and he decided to throw it all away, but honestly, i envy him a little, to have the balls to throw your life away without any and all sorts of thoughts running across your mind. Just unconditional sacrifice....I bet the students didn't notice him until he offered his life to protect them lol.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nDuring my high school years, there was this girl i would always look at (i was shy and would always sit somehwere near the back of the class), during our last year, she came up to me with a group of girls she was too shy to ask me out, so they huddled together, and they asked me if i would date her, and i said \"i don't know\" without thinking about it, i didn't look at her reaction, and kept looking out the window. Now that i look back at the day.. I feel like the biggest asshole, but at the same time i don't care, but it always comes back to haunt me. To be so cold to the first person you actually felt affection for.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI ruined my chance to become a better person, to build up myself with someone else, and share a bed and mind with. Now i believe that i don't deserve any love at all after that. I mean, i'll flirt with women, but i don't think i would ever enter an actual relationship. And it's sad. Growing up, watching Disney movies, anime, or whatever, and there was always love and romance. And stupid me thought... \"Yea, totally can't wait to experience that day!\" and it never came. If i entered a relationship i'd probably get bored and uninterested like the vast majority of things in my life, but at the same time i still want to experience it. It's hard to explain(and that alone pisses me off and makes me feel like a ape brain).   \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow i'm in my 20s, not even independent (which makes me feel horrible and gives me suicidal thoughts). I mean i was working well over full time and i couldn't even afford to live alone without some sort of assistance. Nor do i like the idea of living paycheck to paycheck why i try to find my life which i lost.  I can't do it all, i'm not mentally strong enough or have the motivation or will. I used too.... But as time went on it all died. Nowadays i have no energy to anything.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm putting all my time, thoughts, and energy into a world that doesn't give a shit about me and gives everything and anything to the rich and war. I see so much potential in myself and many other people, but now it's just dying. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI've decided i'm gonna pack my bags, and leave, live on my own. I still feel like a child, nor do i think i'll ever find a real friend or lover (my best friends moved away, one of them had a baby, which shocked me). Although i'm supposedly really young, i just feel old and worn out. I know that this world isn't for me and life isn't so simple,  yet i was born on this random planet to a random species, doing things which i think are stupid, and the people who created them even more stupid. When the country doesn't do anything you care for, and just barely sustains you, you kind of feel like a slave, but an advanced slave. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNot being your own boss, or getting paid to do things you don't like 9-5 everyday is literally robot work (and automation is almost here), I told myself that by the time i reach 30 or if i end up working a dead end job in my 30s i would teach myself how to live out in the wild, withdraw from humanity, live with nature and try to love myself, eventually succumb to the natural elements, and then die, my body to nature. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhen people scream, laugh, or cheer in a crowd of people, all i hear are apes, chimpanzees, especially when you add in the high pitch female screams. It just reminds me of a bunch of chimps, just chimping out over stupid bullshit everyday.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI don't enjoy drinking (i enjoy weed, although it's so expensive to consume), and i know how destructive alcohol is to the mind and body, but now i find myself consuming it without caring much anymore.", "subreddit": "ForeverAlone"}

I basically got my shit together, for once. These are huge accomplishments for me, as I\u2019m someone who used to stay up late, sleep in, binge watch tv, and didn\u2019t really have any goals/did anything important. I\u2019ve been really pushing myself this past year to be the best person I can be, but it\u2019s difficult because I find myself doubting my ability to succeed. So much so that I believe it\u2019s affecting my personality, attitude, and overall performance in life. \n\nFor example, this job is a lot more difficult than I anticipated, and I\u2019m thinking maybe I\u2019m not good enough to work there. It\u2019s been about two months and I\u2018m struggling to befriend my coworkers, most of which are already in this medical program and are doing great.\nI feel like I\u2018m not smart enough to be in this medical program, and I\u2019m not confident enough to be a personal trainer- despite loving medicine and fitness with all of my heart. I\u2019ve been training a few friends and family for about a year now successfully, but I\u2019m worried that my insecurity with myself will be obvious to my actual clients.  \n\nI don\u2019t know why I can\u2019t just believe in myself or feel good about where I am, especially since a couple years ago I was unemployed, depressed, and struggling with drinking problems. \nEven though I know factually I\u2019ve come a long way, I don\u2019t feel any pride or happiness about where I am, but rather constant anxiety about moving forward and doubts about my abilities. A small part of me wants to just walk away and go back to unhealthy habits, even though I know that isn\u2019t the right thing to do. \n\nAnyone else experienced/experiencing this?

Or at least giving you time to figure out even a little bit who you are. I played the tough guy since the start of middle school and I became a bully. I have never actually been a mean guy I only ever really wanted people to be my friend. When I was six the only birthday party I really remember there were four people me my brother my mom and my grandma. I never had a single friend show to a birthday party I liked the gifts but I always hated my birthday for that reason. That birthday was the first time I ever felt rejected and it was terrible. I was kinda the clown for awhile too but even tho I made a few funny jokes and got along with everyone I still never really had friends most of my time was Legos and tv in my house. I changed schools 4 times one I actually liked I was there for 3 years I knew everybody I was a little bit of a bully but I had friends I played sports. A social life was all I ever wanted all I cared about was that my peers knew I existed. And I had it. Then I moved did a bunch of drugs and dropped out. I continue the tough guy bullshit to this day, it\u2019s kinda funny really I continue that \u201ctough\u201d act but I never even kissed a girl. The one girlfriend I ever had won\u2019t talk to me. I almost never wish it happened because after her I know what it\u2019s like to have somebody who cares about you enough to ask you about your problems. I wish I was mature enough to be open with her back then but hey the fuck you gonna do eh. I\u2019m gonna do well financially I\u2019m getting into real estate and I save all my money from work so when I turn 18 in a year I\u2019ll have a good chunk saved up. I have no doubt about that kind of success. However money can\u2019t truly buy happiness broke people live fulfilling lives. If I get successful and I can afford a nice car I worry that it might as well only have one seat. Idfk man if anyone can relate or something like that lmk just thoughts kinda going though my head.

Sometime through middle school I suddenly shifted from a naive, talkative, and fun loving kid, to the more quiet and reserved personality that I've adopted. I first thought that this would be better than the former, as I had believed it would keep me out of drama, which it did. Unfortunately, it caused me to become much more shy and had made it feel impossible to find a relationship.\n\nI find that part of the reason for the sudden shift is that throughout middle school and early high, my family has been experiencing a lot of conflicts. Namely constant fights between my mother and father and whenever one would start I would always hide in my room, waiting for it to end. I even found myself plugging my ears with headphones as to not hear them fight. My father often drunk a lot before fights and would begin smashing or throwing things. At one point he even smashed an entire table. I would try to play games with friends i had online to help me take my mind off the fighting but it almost always wasn't enough, and they would sometimes take the fight into my room. To add onto the fighting, my father worked a job that made move from state to state constantly, meaning I had to switch schools almost every year. I even moved from three different schools in my freshman year of highschool. Inevitably, the thing I feared most happened and my mother and father divorced. I was silent for several weeks at school after that, I almost failed my freshman year because of it all.\n\nWhen it comes to getting a relationship, I've always been incompetent. As early as middle school I would like some girl, but always find it impossible to actually speak to them. I had always been afraid of directly speaking to girls and part of me still is. I really can't explain why either, but it is frustrating to say the least. The most painful part of all is that I've came so close to actually getting a girlfriend. So. Many. Times, but I would always fuck it up somehow, and I would just look like a fool, either because I couldn't take a hint, or I was too shy to simply fucking say \"hi\", and it makes me fucking hate myself for it. I would reprimand myself, saying that I could of done this or that, but your clearly too stupid to understand.\n\nI'm not even sure why I'm posting this here, I think I'm just gotten so desperate to the point that I've begun searching reddit for any form of solice.

I live on the top floor of my building and I have my own little balcony. This weekend, one of my pots fell all the way down while I was away. I managed to save a few plants but most were gone, and the pot itself was broken. I cried about it. I notified my friends about what had happened. I made sure to show them how upset I was, something I don't do very often. My boyfriend and 2 close friends responded. Everyone else straight up ignored me. Not a word. Not even my best friend of around 8 years. It affected me more than I'd like to admit. \n\nMany of the friends who didn't bother to reply have been somewhat cold to me for an extended period of time. So perhaps it makes sense. Maybe they don't care about me the way I care about them. It hurts a lot and I don't know how to properly handle the situation.\n\nMy boyfriend and I are very close and I love him more than anything. But I'm hesitant to be too dependent on him. I know friendships are important. Most of my close friends (the ones who did reply) are going away in summer, which didn't seem like too much of a big deal, until my boyfriend mentioned today that he might go back to England to work over the summer too. It seems I'll be all alone for around 2 months, if he does decide to go. I'd never ask him to stay just for me. That just doesn't feel right. \n\nI know I'm a mess when I'm alone for too long. I need people around me to feel accepted and loved - to feel normal, frankly. I suffer from a lot of social anxiety. Not talking to people makes it much worse. \n\nBecause of this reason I'm scared to cut people out of my life.

No underlying psychological or social reason for being FA romantically, as I've always had lots of friends. \n\nAnyway. I've been thinking a lot lately about the concept of luck, and how it relates to being FA. \n\nGrowing up, I always used to think I had the worst of luck, and how it made me feel disregarded. While I didn't put much thought into it on the account of being young, in retrospect I've come to realise just how poorly I've been treated by everything from teachers and school mates to employers and even doctors. \n\nExamples are too plenty to list, but the worst examples is being cheated (as in literally having my employer denying having ever given me a job for the summer season of an amusement park even though I'd worked there the previous season and xmas) out of jobs, being treated like the class bitch for a musical production (I studied music in high school), and actually being laughed at for showing interest in girls during my school years. I never had any \"luck\" getting jobs during my high school years, and in every job I've had since, I've been generally spoken to and treated in an if not hostile but at the very least indifferent manner. \n\nI never thought at the time that it had anything to do with looks. Most of my failures I chalked up to just having \"bad luck\". I was generally a good student, graduating HS with a 19 out of 20 average for the system at the time, so I've always been somewhat hard working and studying. Yet opportunities for jobs just never appeared for me, while seeing class mates have jobs literally appear out of nowhere. The same with girls. I tried so hard during my HS years to find a girlfriend, but it never happened. I went to all the parties, did all the socializing. Yet again I saw friends get girls without any effort, even complaining about problems with their GFs, not caring a single bit about how \"lucky\" they were to have someone. \n\nSo, what does this have to do with being FA? Well, what I at the time attributed to luck, or bad luck, was in fact due to me being ugly.

I was flabby, out of shape, lazy, unmotivated. I didn't have high grades, I had no social life. I never really went to parties because no one asked me. Never mind girls, I was invisible to them. I had one older cousin who was very sociable and he sometimes took me to a party in his apartment. It's where I learned to drink and felt like an actual human being for the first times of my life. But I'd wake up the next day in an empty bed, hangover, still as lonely as before.\n\nCollege was useless, too. Hopeless. I had very few friends. In elementary school I had one friend, in high school still hung out with that same friend. In college I made one more friend, but him and I drifted apart. I dropped out of college. Twice. Two different studies, each failing within a year or so. I felt like a complete and utter failure.\n\nI just stayed in my house, just lived online essentially. I was a useless online troll. A wikipedia editor. Spent hours upon hours wasting my life away watching series, shows, movies, programs, podcasts, comedy sketches or arguing with people about political bullshit. I worked some dead-end jobs too. Assembly line production, newspaper delivery, dishwasher... I was miserable.\n\nGirls never noticed me. Well one did, in high school. And I fucked it up. She invited me to 'hang out and watch football', and I said 'I will think about it, but I don't like football, so meh' and that's the end of that. Fucking cute girl, too. Hated myself. Spent nights, weeks, months analyzing my conversations, social interactions, and how I fucked them up every time.\n\nAnyway, friendless, lonely stuck at home, working dead end jobs and pissing my life away online... tried some online dating... didn't work. My best friend from college became a successful radio guy. He forgot about me. My best friend from elementary and high school moved to a faraway city. Got into two relationships, both with pretty cute girls, the last one from Sweden and borderline supermodel hot. Invited me to one or two parties... where I was just painfully reminded of my own inadequacy...\n\nAt some point I started using chat sites. Just chatting people, random people. Kinda trolling people, messing around, joking around. Made very few legit connections. Until there was this one girl who was very fun to talk to and who, by some miracle, didn't seem bored by me. Even though I insisted she would be... in fact, she insisted SHE was the boring one. The broken and messed up one. I asked for her Skype (this is around 2011) and she reluctantly gave her contact details.\n\nThe girl and I started talking a lot. Just chatting, words only. I never showed her my face and she never showed me hers. Not for weeks, not for months. We just talked. She lived in a faraway country. Her studies were kinda failing too, she said and she didn't care much for the subjects she had chosen. I encouraged her to try and study still, so at least one of us wouldn't be an academic failure. So, she tried. I helped her even with her thesis. When she wrote it, she thanked me in it.\n\nLet's call her... Kristine. Now Kristine, she was lonely too. Had few friends, and the friends she did have, were social butterflies with a lot more going on in their lives compared to her. She felt very left out. They all had boyfriends. One of her friends was lesbian and had a long distance girlfriend. All of them had 'someone'. At some point she and I became more and more close. Trusted each other. We came to a point where we wouldn't even care the other thought we were hideous... we would just be hideous together, I guess. So I bit the bullet and called up. Skype rang. Scariest, most nerve-wrecking sound ever.\n\nAt first we just did voice calls. She had a very cute voice. Very soft-spoken, clear, a little deep for a girl. She said my voice was 'nice', lol. Add that to the list of things I never heard before. Eventually we went on camera. She was pretty cute right away. Even though she kept pointing out her flaws to me... oily skin, high forehead, big pointed nose, frizzy hair... I didn't care. I think it worked in her favor. I think all the features she had somehow combined formed a nice face. I liked seeing her. I liked hearing her. And she said she felt the same about me. This was something I never thought I would experience in a million years, in a million lifetimes, but I did. \n\nOf course she was extremely insecure and just a few calls didn't erase that insecurity. Both of us never kissed anyone. Never held hands, exchanged anything more than a platonic hug with the opposite gender. Both of us were utterly convinced we were entirely hideous. For a time she tried to push me away... she would tell me to leave. Cry. Make dramas. Make things difficult. She even said I \"could get better\", haha what a joke... I told her as much. Told her I wasn't going anywhere. That it was her or nothing. She even unfriended me once. Blocked me briefly. But she came back, tearful, apologetic. Eventually we admitted that we didn't just liked each other, but loved each other. We were now in a long distance relationship, a concept neither of us believed in. But we were broke. We couldn't meet up yet so we defined it... started writing long letters back and forth.\n\nThe letters got longer and longer. Several pages each, word counts of 2000 and up. I'd write them in an hour or less, it was crazy how fast I was, how she inspired me. I felt more and more optimistic, less and less unwanted, less undesired. I knew now that at least one person in the world wanted me...\n\nWhat terrified me the most was the fact that we met on Omegle. A chat site that connects you to completely random strangers within seconds, and where the smallest glitch in the system can cause you to disconnect with no way of finding back the person you talked to... I could have so easily lost my connection with her, before we exchanged details. I could have so easily lost it, and her, and I would have still been here, as Forever Alone as any of the people here. Instead I got incredibly lucky. Worked my ass off for months for a year... worked five jobs at the same time... saved up... bought a ticket and flew to be with her. Traveled around her country for two months, had a magical time. Met her family, with her father and mother becoming sort of surrogate parents to me as well. It was like a warm bath of acceptance after a lifetime of pretty much nothingness...\n\nI was overeager. Both of us were. So during that first stay there, our first time there, we were like rabbits making up for lost time, making up for all those high school and college years of sexual frustration pent up within us. So she got pregnant. I was terrified but also over the moon with joy because now even if she would leave, well, I would have this permanent reminder that I was once loved. Proposed to her right there and then.\n\nYears have passed. We met in 2011. Now it's 2019 and we have two beautiful children with a third on the way. I was FA. Now I'm pretty normal. Still have social anxiety. Still feel shy, still feel useless, at times. Still feel sad, at times. But most of all, above all else, I feel grateful. And lucky. So damn lucky. And I hope you will be lucky, too.

But when I do **the exact same thing**, people lose their shit and start verbally assaulting me. It's like people inexplicably just establish different standards for me than everyone else. This is something I've constantly noticed throughout my life, from when I was little to even recently. This happens in many different ways. For example, in high school (or sometimes even in college) someone would crack a really dirty and tasteless joke and everyone would laugh, but when I made a joke of similar nature or even far tamer in comparison, people would just get offended and scold me. Or when I was growing up and we had group labs in science class, all of my classmates would carry out the procedures as instructed, but the moment I tried to contribute by doing the exact same thing as everyone else or even just picked something up, my classmates would freak out and start yelling, \"Put that down! That's really dangerous! You're gonna hurt someone! Just leave it!\" What the fuck? I was following the exact same instructions as all of you! What did I do to earn this kind of reputation? \n\nI forget which post it was, but I saw a comment about the difficulty of being accepted into any social group, and even if you are accepted, you're still automatically labeled as \"the weird guy\" of the group or some kind of wild card. That really hit close to home for me. Because in every group I've been a part of, people are just naturally more wary of me than everyone else and are overly critical of everything I say or do for some inexplicable reason. \n\nAgain, I don't know what it is about me that has always given me this kind of reputation with people, it's just something I've always noticed.

I've been working out for a while now but have always had too high body fat to see any muscle definition, and have decided to lean out to cash in my gains and see what's been hiding under the fat all this time, and o maximise my weighted callisthenics performance. Being over 20% body fat was not healthy at all for me and I didn't really realise how fat I'd actually gotten until I lost it, and I feel a lot better now (currently around mid-teens). I've been getting a few compliments about my weight loss lately, people telling me that I look quite fit and healthy. The plan is to lean out to around 12% and re-evaluate, possibly hover between 12-15% after summer, and do a full shred for Summer 2020 once I've upped my strength some more (but obviously not stay shredded, that's unhealthy too).\n\nAfter health, aesthetics, performance, and for personal growth, I want to do this to enhance my attractiveness. Looking back, my face was really fucking round and bloated and hid my facial features, and I hated looking at myself in photos and videos because it made me look ugly. I've looked back at photos of myself as a teen / young adult when I was skinny and had a leaner face, and to be honest I wasn't bad looking at all--I was kinda cute. I really want to see what getting lean does for my interest in women in day-to-day life and on dating sites.

Don't really have any friends either.\n\nI finished college 2 years ago.  I doubled majored in accounting and business, but I have no capability to get a job in that field nor do I have the desire to anyway.  I only majored in them because I was getting good grades in the classes.  I never made the transition from being someone who goes to school to someone who goes to work.  I have no idea how to be an adult.  When I finished college I moved right back in with my parents.\n\nI got a job at my old high school as a substitute teacher and as a track coach.  Pretty much the only people I talk to on a regular basis are the students.  I look like I'm their age and my personality is that of someone younger too, so I'm this weird novelty that I guess these kids are all amused by and therefore they all talk to me a lot as if I'm a peer and not an authority figure.  They like don't view me as an adult at all.  And for awhile that didn't bother me.  They're the closest things I have to friends and for the most part I've enjoyed talking to them.  But I can tell that the novelty's starting to wear off and they're growing tired of me.\n\nLast year when I started working as a sub it was great because, for the first time, I felt like I actually mattered to people.  It never failed to make my day when the high schoolers would express happiness and excitement when they learned I was the sub for their class.  That charm is gone now, I guess. They're used to me now.  Once again I don't matter to anyone anymore, just like when I was in high school as a student.\n\nOh and the best part is when they ask me a lot of questions about my relationship experience and they learn that I've never been in one.  They feed me all the same BS that adults do.  All the stuff about having to just wait and I'd eventually meet the right person, or how I just need to get a Tinder and that'll somehow magically fix my problems.  They don't get at all how completely broken I am.  How I'm just the worst combination of introverted, Aspergic, inexperienced, depressed, and just plain too average-looking to be considered attractive.  Just a pathetic waste of existence.  Pretty pathetic of me that I get jealous over seeing high schoolers enter into relationships because I know that these kids have already accomplished more with their lives than I ever will.\n\nI was a social failure in high school, a social failure in college, and now a social failure in my adult life.

Two girls, one guy - all I would consider normies with large social circles/capital. The girls said that its so hard to find the right guy, and that due to online apps and social media, standards have increased a lot these past years. They even admitted their own standards have increased. The guy had been on about 5 dates, but was never able to establish a relationship. The girls all ghosted/broke up with him.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMeanwhile I have never been on a date, and the main problem for me is I don't meet many girls in the first place. It is very hard to meet girls if you don't have a large social group/capital. Advice to younger FAs, if you don't acquire a good social group during college, it will be very hard to acquire one after. Likewise, it is harder to acquire a SO after college, especially if you don't have a large social group to support you. Additionally, with adult responsibilities like work, finances, less free time, etc... dating becomes exponentially harder. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy point is, these people admitted that the dating game is hard. If it is already hard for them, it is going to be very very hard for us FAs. It is not 100% impossible to find a SO after college, but a lot of dating depends on a lot of luck like I mentioned in my previous post. I would be comfortable saying that some people I knew who met their SO in college would be FA right now if they never met their SO in college.

{"post_id": "bu0vnl", "created_utc": 1559054750, "title": "He was all I had and I'm alone again... need help coping.", "author": "cherrycontra", "self_text": "I have found myself to be alone for most of my life. I've always had difficulty with making genuine connections with others and it's harder to do so when you're older. Most of my childhood bestfriends moved away when I was young and we didn't keep in touch. I made a few more friends and they left too. That was in middle school and the damage was done because it just gets harder trying to make actual connections... for most of my life I wanted someone to care for, and I craved a relationship ever since high school. In February during my second year of college I got into my first relationship after making major improvements in my life, and now he's gone. My (now) ex and I broke up a week ago today. It was a very odd situation. We were together for three months and in the two weeks before our break up he just felt very distant and avoidant. I thought it was because of a conversation that we had about me feeling insecure, but he said that he is disappointed in himself and how he is not where he wants to be in his life in any aspect (financially, physically, mentally, responsibly). He feels like I deserve better because trying to accomplish all of those things and struggling personally while being in a relationship just can't work. He says he knows I love him and care for him for who he is, but he needs to change. \n\nI'm really torn because we never fought in our relationship at all, and the break up was odd because I thought he was breaking up with me when he really wasn't, so I broke up, and then he actually broke up. \n\nLet me explain. \n\nAs I said after that conversation he became more avoidant where he wouldn't text back for a while or flaked out on plans to meet in person, and I thought he was ghosting me. So after a week of these games I packed all of his gifts for me from my birthday and our mementos and I wrote a note and left it at his door as no one answered when I knocked. The note basically was me telling him that I was giving myself closure as it appears he is done with me but hasn't spoken up, and that I still love him and wish him well.... then, a few hours later I see a note in my mailbox and my necklace I left at his place and a bottle of ibuprofen I bought him. The note expressed how he was actually just very busy that week and that he's sorry for not communicating and being avoidant, it's just that he has a lot going on with work, his car, and his health. I tried very hard to be supportive because he's been having these struggles since around the start of the second month of our relationship, but his lack of communication really just made me hurt and confused, especially in the last week when we couldn't meet up even once despite living around the corner. We decided to meet up later on that night to talk in person and he expressed how he has been having a lot of pain again in his back where he basically just has to sleep on the floor now, and that he doesn't want me to see him that way or to see him in a negative light. He says that he's turning 22 and that he has really gotten nowhere in his life as he still lives at home, still works as a server, still isn't at the weight he wants to be at, and has no idea what he wants to do with his life. He doesn't really have much money either and his a/c broke a while ago, but when he found out how much it cost to replace, he says he started to fall out of love with me a bit. I don't know what I did to make him fall out of love with me because of that. Was it stress? I don't know. But I always tried to be there and I recommended other places for him to go to that weren't as costly... I really loved him with every fiber of my being... and I asked if we were over and he said yes, he has no idea how to sustain a relationship with everything going on. All I want to do is support him but there's nothing I can do if he doesn't want me in his life, but I miss him because I never really had a lot of friends in my life, and I'm mostly a loner I suppose. It's difficult for me to find people that aren't flakey and he's gone now, so without having anyone but a dysfunctional family makes it very difficult to process. \n\nWhile we spoke, I told him how I never thought he was a bad boyfriend and I spoke about all of the good memories we had and how he made me feel special and he cried a lot. I'm not sure if he was crying earlier because he had sunglasses on when I saw him, but I saw all the tears rolling down his cheeks. He says he loves me as a person now, but he still has some romantic feelings for me, it's just that his life isn't where he wants it to be at all. I also told him to understand that he has worth and that he can't let anyone else or even himself tell him otherwise, and he cried again and said that I'm too nice... \n\nIt's difficult because I know he's going through a lot and all I want to do is support him because I know what it's like to be alone, but he says being alone is the only way he can really do anything productive. It still hurts though. I know he sounds like a loser but I love him. He made me feel special and I felt safe around him. No one ever made me feel the way he made me feel and he was very sweet and caring, and I loved talking and being with him. He fell for me really hard which is why it doesn't make sense to me. He was the one who solidified the relationship, he introduced me to his family and friends, and he wanted me to meet his coworkers from the start, and he was the one who first said he loved me, so it's not like he didn't care about me, at least I don't think so, and he asked about doing long distance last month when I got accepted into college. It was only a three month relationship but we spent a lot of time together and things developed quickly, and it was my first relationship and his second. I tried so hard to be a good girlfriend - I made him soup when he was sick, I gave him ibuprofen because he didn't have any at home, I always tried to rub his back, I stayed with him at the library so he could finish his work... he said I didn't have to do that but I told him it was because I wanted to because I loved him, and he did cry when I said that, too... I tried so hard. I really did. I wanted to be a good girlfriend and I wanted to be there for him and I just want to ask what I did so wrong to make him fall out of love with me. I thought it was because I told him about my family drama, but he said it wasn't. I thought it was because he mentioned during our conversation before around a aeel before our break up that my mom has control over me, and that didn't sit well with me... that was the only sour thing in our relationship and I'm blaming myself because I initiated the talk and I returned the gifts and left the note. Maybe we'd still be together if I didn't do that. I feel like I failed our relationship because his other one lasted six months, so it makes me feel like maybe I wasn't good enough. But he said that he and that girl broke up seven times and that it ended badly and that this break up was very peaceful and calming despite the pain. \n\nI asked if we could take a break but he says he doesn't know if that would work because he doesn't know how long it will take him to put his life where he wants it to be. I asked could there ever be any possibility of us being together again, and he said \"maybe we'll find each other in the future again when we both figure out what we want in our lives\". He said he wouldn't be dating anytime soon because of him needing to get this stuff together and because he doesn't have the money for first dates. \n\nThis conversation was so long. I didn't want him to leave... we were talking for nearly two hours and I kept mentioning the good memories we had. I didn't want him to go as I held his hand and he placed his hand on my knee. I would do anything to just be back in his arms. Before we left I told him I respect his decision despite it hurting and that I wish him well and to remember what I told him and to please take care of himself. I asked if I could kiss him on the cheek, just once more before leaving, he let me, and then he kissed mine. It's so bittersweet because the first move I made was kissing him on the cheek shyly, and then I remember one rainy day we ran out to my car so I could drive him closer to where we parked, and before he left, he kissed my cheek, and I felt like the happiest person in the world. \n\nI would do anything to go back to those moments. I guess love isn't enough sometimes. \n\nHis birthday is coming up on Sunday... I want to text him happy birthday because on my birthday he had to endure my crazy family during the most awkward dinner ever, so it's the least I can do... but I don't know if I should. I was thinking about doing no contact for a month but I don't know. He's leaving for Columbia a few days after his birthday until the end of June and I don't know if I should tell him happy birthday or what. I just worry he's going to forget about me and find a fling. He isn't like that and only has had sex with me and his first ex, but still, it worries me. He's single now and I know he can do whatever he wants and that I don't own him but the thought hurts. This is harder to move on because like I said, I was never really that close to anyone in my life, and he was my first everything... he lives next to me and we work next to each other so it's worse. My decision to go away to college is actually partially due to the fact that if I stay I know I'm going to go crazy. Also I don't know when I should add him again on social media. Before parting I asked if he was still keeping my number and he said yes of course, but I told him that I removed him on social media after I thought he ghosted me, and asked if it's okay to add him back, and he said yes. But I don't know, it doesn't feel right to add him back, at least not now. Should I try no contact for a month? I don't know. This break up is much harder because it's not like there were many negatives of the relationship and as I said we never fought. \n\nI'm leaving for college and I haven't told him yet that I'm going. But I want to see him before I go away, just one last time, because I do care for him as a person, and he will always have a place in my heart... when should I try to reach contact with him again? Between what I read about no contact and his birthday coming up nearly two weeks after our break up as well as him going to be out of the country for a few weeks, I don't know how to approach this. I'm trying to keep as busy as possible, and I'm going to go to therapy and I've been exercising more and getting back into music, but this feeling is still there in my chest... what do I do? I don't want him to be somebody that I used to know. It blows my mind that you can be so intimate with someone and then cut them out. I hate this because I have so many urges and desires and I know people are going to say \"just do it with anyone you fancy, find someone else now!\" but I'm not into that, I want that genuine connection, that intimacy... It is just so weird to me and it beats me. I don't want to leave my bed again today... I just feel so tired and heartbroken.", "subreddit": "lonely"}

During college I was a typical student that balanced my social and academic life (studied hard and partied harder).  I only had 2 serious relationships (the last one I ended it during my freshmen year in college) but ended it both because when things got serious I felt suffocated (probably because my parents weren't the best role models for a stable committed relationship). \n\nGranted I loved both of them but staying longer in the relationship meant sacrificing my time (which I dedicated most of it by studying and work) which would have been unfair for them. So I spent the rest of my years from Sophomore year and beyond working on my goals but I went on occasional dates because I love getting to know people. \n\nNow I'm at a place where I can be able to balance my work and having a serious relationship but there seems to be no one available (Ive exhausted my connections on the date pool and I live in a city where everyone knows everyone) and meeting someone new meant moving to a new city (which I can't make that move for the next 2 years).\n\nIm not alone ( my friends, family, and work keep me happy and distracted) but I missed that connection that comes in a relationship. I simply don't want any one to casually date. I want someone to do life with.\n\nI feel like I'm rushing into things. I know things like this shouldn't be rushed but it's still damn frustrating! \n\nThanks for reading.

Back in secondary and uni, I used to fake everything and pretend like I care about interests that 99% of people in my surrounding have. There's also this specific type of mentality which I find to be so off-putting and untolerable. It's the worst when you realize that you've never had a real friend and that every IRL person in your life was pitying you hardcore. I've heard people say: just go online (fb, sc, ig, twitter, w/e) and you'll eventually stumble upon someone. But that's not how it works. Most of these people already had someone to work with and well.. work their way up to more people. And how are you evem supposed to do that when your hobbies are already super niche? Another thing that puts me down is that others often get depressed due to most of their friends being online, and I'm here wishing I could at least have that. Being a broke dropout is certainly not helping and living in a 3rd world craphole is making things even crappier.  Then theres romanticizing about being in a relationship, which is something I wanna give up on, but I can't. And I know that a lot of this is a byproduct of having a horrible childhood, and I've tried numerous solutions (none of which have worked). Nowadays, I'm slowly losing motivation to do practically anything anymore. I'm now stuck with this super-nihilistic view on everything and I can't shake it.

Whether we post in r/lonely or anywhere else on Reddit, we are looking for connection, all of us. We receive it on some level, usually briefly, but it's still not enough. We start posting looking for friends, most connections are also brief. It's the nature of the beast. \n\nI stay at home with my 2yo, my husband works at a job that barely pays the bills. If I could work, I would. Instead I have a couple of side hustles that fall within my capabilities to make a little cash here and there. Everyone on my side of the block know me and stop to chat. Some of our other neighbors know me and my son on sight, as we are outside almost every day from April through October. The workers at the local Aldi have known us since LO was 3 months old, it's a pleasure to interact with them. I can talk to just about anybody on the street.\n\nBUT! If it involves any kind of stakes- possible rejection, putting my foot in your mouth, not clicking well, potential hurt and/or hardship... I have so many feels and sometimes odd reactions. I'm no longer the confident, affable, engaging person I otherwise am. I'm shy and kind of awkward. I either turn inward or go into overshare overload. I don't have many friends, or my own family. My husband's family *are* my family, but I have maybe 2 friends outside of that. My husband is regularly at work 14 hours a day. I stay at home. God it's so lonely my husband and I are best friends and definitely make it work. Our relationship is healthy. Doesn't mean I'm not alone at 12p while I'm making lunch and there's a whining toddler at my feet.

Depression is starting to set in some.\n\n I'm burned out, my husband is burned out. His bosses are verbally abusive towards their employees. His boss is the VP's son and his mom is HR (small company). They suck at their jobs and gang up on everyone who doesn't let the family disrespect them. The owner either can't see it, or won't do anything about it. Everything is falling apart there, it sucks because we had made a few good buddies and genuinely care about the company. I'm personally hurt, especially when I tried to reach out with my own concerns and never received a response. I have to deal with it's effects privately. My husband is already so strung out over it, I'm his rock. I feel alone in my experience of it all.

I felt so bad i couldn't sleep and take my car and \"try\" to go find him even though I knew I couldn't. I cried so much because i felt I was a part of this problem and that I could have done something. I realized He was never laughing in class when the teacher was saying jokes and he avoid talking to anybody and leave the class pretty fast. He was often in advance and read books alone in the dark in the classroom. Also, he stopped going to classes and that's why I can't get over it! \n\n( my first class with him 2-3 years ago, he was very kind to me and ask me if I wanted to be his partner and he help me in a way because I thought no one would ask and it makes me happy but still we haven't talk during this class and the ones after!

That number quickly decreased to 2 though and then after a few weeks of talking to one of the girls I finally decided last week to ask her out.

It's something that, at least for me, makes sense: You meet a girl, you chat with her, make conversations, get to know her and if she's has that flick that makes me attracted to her, then I go for it. It seems simple enough, alas I've only been met with turn downs.You see, this culture of hitting it, right of the bat, is very bizarre to me. I mean, how can you be certain that the one you choose to flirt with, is one that will give you a healthy relationship? Or is it more for the sex? Is it only for the sex?\n\nMy very close friends seem to all agree on this: I fail, because I force the friendzone on me. Yet I see that many of their relationships, if not all, that started off as a spontanious flirt on the road to some bar, seemed to have had many problems, that caused them scars, they do not admit to have.\n\nIn fact only a handful , 1-2, of said relationships happened to flourish into something beautiful for both the members.\n\nYet my personal struggle of constant friendzoning, is met with the same advice. \"You need to be more assertive. You need to just go for it. Your failure is on your hands, don't blame others.\"\n\nIt's very easy for them to say. They have so much confidence of themselves to flirt. Most of them have also physical prowess, or the essential social skills to interact with basically everyone. But I, seem to be the more reserved one, when it comes to interacting with new people at least.They tried to hook me up with people they knew a couple of times, but I could never find myself the courage to continue things, or rather, when I did, it was too late. That was to my relief, as I did not see a very good reason to get into them in the first place, one person I happened to see as an older sibling, I never had, and made very good friends with. Another was very soft spoken, but didn't know what they want, even if I tried to make them comfortable. I was mocked in most cases, or rather I was scolded, for \"leaving such a catch\".\n\nIn order to shield myself from ridicule, the friendly kind, I even lied to them that I've made some hits when I was abroad, when in fact there was none. It's been 5 years since, and I have yet to tell them the truth about it.\n\nDon't get me wrong, it's not like I am nagging about it or anything. I am fine as long as we don't engage in relationship discussions, that usually are followed with a \"When are you going to find someone\" quote at the end of it, to which I would most likely laugh awkardly.\n\nAs if I was raised in a different time, or some crap like that. I find the whole hook-up culture really weird and unfitting to my \"playstyle\". I have been thinking of changing my ways, but I don't get it, where to start, what to say, what not to say etc.  \nTo be a little fair though, I have been raised a bit more conservatively, being in a soft religious family, with which I never engage too much in the relationship part of advice, even when they sometimes see my sporadic anguish and sorrow , and they try their hardest to help me out, find out what's on my mind, advice me etc.\n\nI 've had these thoughts in my head for a very long time, I felt like sharing them.", "subreddit": "ForeverAlone"}

My friend (14F) is moving in like 9 days and I'm really depressed about it but I wanna look tough. I feel like I won't have good contact with her in the coming time and that scares me. We were really close, to the point that we almost dated and stuff. We hung out every day (Class of 13, private school :) ) and always had long conversations, made each other laugh, did funny stuff like browse memes together, and we'd stay late after classes and finish stuff. When we had shop class, we stayed for like half an hour and finished building a table that needed to be finished. When I decided to build a guitar for a school project, she helped me stretch the strings and whatever I needed and I helped her with hers and we had fun in the process. We worked really well together and I had more in common with her than any of the boys in our entire school. When I saw her, I felt like my day got a lot better, and she was always there when anyone needed her. I always listened to what she had to say and paid attention and she reciprocated. She was the kind of girl that would always hang with the guys and she didn't care about all the girl drama. She was very smart like me and we could challenge each other and hold a conversation. For her 13th birthday, she asked her aunt for a microscope so she could do science experiments. Tell me an 8th-grade girl who likes science that much isn't special, it's not possible. Not to mention she was the tallest girl in our class, and at 6'4 at 14 years old, it's nice to have a tall friend. She was also incredibly hot and always had something nice or funny to say. She was quirky like me and we fit together like we were meant to meet each other. Maybe writing this is a form of therapy or some shit, but I really need help fast. We both have a fear of change, but I HATE it. Any kind of major change scares and bothers me.

The problem with this is that ending up with somebody  completely different than you will inevitably make you fucking miserable, and why wouldn't it? People so easily commit to spend their whole lives to a person they would dislike in any scenario they're not having sex. I've been thinking about this a lot now, there's no point in caring so much about not having another person because the whole thing is basically a catch-22. You either: end up with a person like you who shares your shortcomings, somebody who fixes your shortcomings but makes you miserable, or you end up alone. I can choose to be super miserable about my isolation, or think of it as an opportunity to be free of the paradox. The only way out, according to Schopenhauer, is ridding ourselves of our incessant desires and idea that the world should have been a fairytale for us. I'm not sure if I can ever let go of the idea of another person completing me but I think deep down, I've always known letting it go will be the only way to find peace for myself and I'm developing this strange morbid acceptance towards the whole deal.

She doesn\u2019t stand out in any way. Her clothes are nothing special. The back of her hair is still bent out of shape from sleep. She isn\u2019t young, either - must be near thirty, not even close to a \u201cgirl,\u201d properly speaking. But still, I know from fifty yards away: She\u2019s the 100% perfect girl for me. The moment I see her, there\u2019s a rumbling in my chest, and my mouth is as dry as a desert.  \n\n\nMaybe you have your own particular favorite type of girl - one with slim ankles, say, or big eyes, or graceful fingers, or you\u2019re drawn for no good reason to girls who take their time with every meal. I have my own preferences, of course. Sometimes in a restaurant I\u2019ll catch myself staring at the girl at the next table to mine because I like the shape of her nose.  \n\n\nBut no one can insist that his 100% perfect girl correspond to some preconceived type. Much as I like noses, I can\u2019t recall the shape of hers - or even if she had one. All I can remember for sure is that she was no great beauty. It\u2019s weird.  \n\n\n\u201cYesterday on the street I passed the 100% girl,\u201d I tell someone.  \n\n\n\u201cYeah?\u201d he says. \u201cGood-looking?\u201d  \n\n\n\u201cNot really.\u201d  \n\n\n\u201cYour favorite type, then?\u201d  \n\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know. I can\u2019t seem to remember anything about her - the shape of her eyes or the size of her breasts.\u201d  \n\n\n\u201cStrange.\u201d  \n\n\n\u201cYeah. Strange.\u201d  \n\n\n\u201cSo anyhow,\u201d he says, already bored, \u201cwhat did you do? Talk to her? Follow her?\u201d  \n\n\n\u201cNah. Just passed her on the street.\u201d  \n\n\nShe\u2019s walking east to west, and I west to east. It\u2019s a really nice April morning.  \n\n\nWish I could talk to her. Half an hour would be plenty: just ask her about herself, tell her about myself, and - what I\u2019d really like to do - explain to her the complexities of fate that have led to our passing each other on a side street in Harajuku on a beautiful April morning in 1981. This was something sure to be crammed full of warm secrets, like an antique clock build when peace filled the world.  \n\n\nAfter talking, we\u2019d have lunch somewhere, maybe see a Woody Allen movie, stop by a hotel bar for cocktails. With any kind of luck, we might end up in bed.  \n\n\nPotentiality knocks on the door of my heart.  \n\n\nNow the distance between us has narrowed to fifteen yards.  \n\n\nHow can I approach her? What should I say?  \n\n\n\u201cGood morning, miss. Do you think you could spare half an hour for a little conversation?\u201d  \n\n\nRidiculous. I\u2019d sound like an insurance salesman.  \n\n\n\u201cPardon me, but would you happen to know if there is an all-night cleaners in the neighborhood?\u201d  \n\n\nNo, this is just as ridiculous. I\u2019m not carrying any laundry, for one thing. Who\u2019s going to buy a line like that?  \n\n\nMaybe the simple truth would do. \u201cGood morning. You are the 100% perfect girl for me.\u201d  \n\n\nNo, she wouldn\u2019t believe it. Or even if she did, she might not want to talk to me. Sorry, she could say, I might be the 100% perfect girl for you, but you\u2019re not the 100% boy for me. It could happen. And if I found myself in that situation, I\u2019d probably go to pieces. I\u2019d never recover from the shock. I\u2019m thirty-two, and that\u2019s what growing older is all about.  \n\n\nWe pass in front of a flower shop. A small, warm air mass touches my skin. The asphalt is damp, and I catch the scent of roses. I can\u2019t bring myself to speak to her. She wears a white sweater, and in her right hand she holds a crisp white envelope lacking only a stamp. So: She\u2019s written somebody a letter, maybe spent the whole night writing, to judge from the sleepy look in her eyes. The envelope could contain every secret she\u2019s ever had.  \n\n\nI take a few more strides and turn: She\u2019s lost in the crowd.  \n\n\nNow, of course, I know exactly what I should have said to her. It would have been a long speech, though, far too long for me to have delivered it properly. The ideas I come up with are never very practical.  \n\n\nOh, well. It would have started \u201cOnce upon a time\u201d and ended \u201cA sad story, don\u2019t you think?\u201d  \n\n\nOnce upon a time, there lived a boy and a girl. The boy was eighteen and the girl sixteen. He was not unusually handsome, and she was not especially beautiful. They were just an ordinary lonely boy and an ordinary lonely girl, like all the others. But they believed with their whole hearts that somewhere in the world there lived the 100% perfect boy and the 100% perfect girl for them. Yes, they believed in a miracle. And that miracle actually happened.  \n\n\nOne day the two came upon each other on the corner of a street.  \n\n\n\u201cThis is amazing,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ve been looking for you all my life. You may not believe this, but you\u2019re the 100% perfect girl for me.\u201d  \n\n\n\u201cAnd you,\u201d she said to him, \u201care the 100% perfect boy for me, exactly as I\u2019d pictured you in every detail. It\u2019s like a dream.\u201d  \n\n\nThey sat on a park bench, held hands, and told each other their stories hour after hour. They were not lonely anymore. They had found and been found by their 100% perfect other. What a wonderful thing it is to find and be found by your 100% perfect other. It\u2019s a miracle, a cosmic miracle.  \n\n\nAs they sat and talked, however, a tiny, tiny sliver of doubt took root in their hearts: Was it really all right for one\u2019s dreams to come true so easily?  \n\n\nAnd so, when there came a momentary lull in their conversation, the boy said to the girl, \u201cLet\u2019s test ourselves - just once. If we really are each other\u2019s 100% perfect lovers, then sometime, somewhere, we will meet again without fail. And when that happens, and we know that we are the 100% perfect ones, we\u2019ll marry then and there. What do you think?\u201d  \n\n\n\u201cYes,\u201d she said, \u201cthat is exactly what we should do.\u201d  \n\n\nAnd so they parted, she to the east, and he to the west.  \n\n\nThe test they had agreed upon, however, was utterly unnecessary. They should never have undertaken it, because they really and truly were each other\u2019s 100% perfect lovers, and it was a miracle that they had ever met. But it was impossible for them to know this, young as they were. The cold, indifferent waves of fate proceeded to toss them unmercifully.  \n\n\nOne winter, both the boy and the girl came down with the season\u2019s terrible inluenza, and after drifting for weeks between life and death they lost all memory of their earlier years. When they awoke, their heads were as empty as the young D. H. Lawrence\u2019s piggy bank.  \n\n\nThey were two bright, determined young people, however, and through their unremitting efforts they were able to acquire once again the knowledge and feeling that qualified them to return as full-fledged members of society. Heaven be praised, they became truly upstanding citizens who knew how to transfer from one subway line to another, who were fully capable of sending a special-delivery letter at the post office. Indeed, they even experienced love again, sometimes as much as 75% or even 85% love.  \n\n\nTime passed with shocking swiftness, and soon the boy was thirty-two, the girl thirty.  \n\n\nOne beautiful April morning, in search of a cup of coffee to start the day, the boy was walking from west to east, while the girl, intending to send a special-delivery letter, was walking from east to west, but along the same narrow street in the Harajuku neighborhood of Tokyo. They passed each other in the very center of the street. The faintest gleam of their lost memories glimmered for the briefest moment in their hearts. Each felt a rumbling in their chest. And they knew:  \n\n\nShe is the 100% perfect girl for me.  \n\n\nHe is the 100% perfect boy for me.  \n\n\nBut the glow of their memories was far too weak, and their thoughts no longer had the clarity of fouteen years earlier. Without a word, they passed each other, disappearing into the crowd. Forever.  \n\n\nA sad story, don\u2019t you think?  \n\n\nYes, that\u2019s it, that is what I should have said to her.", "subreddit": "lonely"}

I still thought there was a woman out there for me. I was in my mid 20's and never tried online dating. \n\nA few years later I had used dating sites for a couple of years. I did get some dates but never got past the first date. Usually we didn't have any chemistry so I knew the rejection was coming. Sometimes they ghosted. Sometimes the rejected me in person. Sometimes they rejected me over the phone texting me. There was one date that I remember crushing me. It wasn't so much the rejection, it was the way she rejected me. \n\nI started talking to her on a dating site and we got along. She knew what I looked like and agreed to a date. We met at a coffee shop and talked for an hour. We had good chemistry and that made the date be fun for me. She was average looking although her personality made her more attractive. She was one of those people who can make you smile just by how she looked at you. Her smile and being nice caused me to smile and feel better about myself because the date was going well. \n\nAt the end of the date I was feeling great. I thought after years of rejections and no chemistry, I found the woman for me. I know it's naive to put that kind of emotion into a first date but I had never had a first date go so well. I didn't let it become obvious and didn't act clingy. I knew I was going to escape FA. I had never had that much chemistry with a woman. At the end of the date I knew she would say yes to a second date. \n\nAfter the date we walked outside to say bye to each other. I knew I was going to get a second date for the first time but as a formality I asked her if she wanted to meet again fully expecting her to say yes. She looked at me and hugged me. With a look of pity in her eyes she said, I'm obviously not interested in you in that way but I want to be friends with you. I was crushed. I know some people will call me a nice guy and think I felt entitled to a second date, I didn't feel entitled but did think the date went well to where she wanted to have a second date. I never heard from her again. She ghosted on me the next day. \n\nWhat crushed me wasn't the rejection. It was her hugging me with a look of pity. Her saying obviously I'm not interested in you in that way crushed me. I had been getting into better shape. I looked and dressed the best I could. I met a woman I had chemistry with and thought this would finally give me that chance to escape FA. \n\nAfter getting the pity rejection, I started to believe that maybe I wouldn't escape FA. Usually I had no chemistry with the women I dated and sometimes they were mean to me. Not this woman. I keep saying it but I thought I was finally escaping FA. I think from the moment she saw me, I was going to get rejected. Nothing I said would change that. \n\nThis rejection caused me to start to give up on dating sites. If I couldn't get a second date with someone I hit it off with. I had a few more dates after her but I didn't have anything close to the chemistry I had with her. I'm not mad at her for pity rejecting me. If I talked to her I would have thanked her. People will tell me how it was just one rejection and everyone gets rejected.That's true, but that rejection started my giving up of finding someone. I didn't give up for a couple more years. Therapists during that time were able to convince me there were more women like her out there. I just needed to keep going. In reality, that hug and look of pity got me to start to accept that even the women I did get along with would reject me. I had one more good date. She was above average looking and I knew I didn't have a chance. She gave me the courtesy of the full date even though I saw her look of wanting to leave. She was really nice to me. Online she looked average but in person she was more attractive. \n\nA couple dates after the second woman, I realized how much money dating was costing me and I couldn't afford it anymore. While my first dates were usually at coffee shops, it was the mental exhaustion from being rejected so many times and the not being able to afford to keep going out to meet these women. \n\nI know some of you will say at least you got first dates. I was able to get those dates but online I could hide my social awkwardness and despite me being ugly, my personality got them interested enough to go on first dates with me. I never had a second date with any of those women. Her rejection stuck with me because of that look she gave me. It was similar to a child telling a teacher they love them. She said aww during the rejection causing me to feel worse. I know she was trying to reject me in a nice way but that rejection stands out because it was my best first date. \n\nFor any of you who have gone on dates, have you had a pity rejection where they give you that look of pity? Sorry for the length of this post but it's 2am and I'm half asleep.\n\nTl;dr, a pity rejection crushed me.", "subreddit": "ForeverAlone"}

But it feels great to know that hey maybe I have a chance out there. I feel more confident.\n\nSo normies fail to address the toll it takes on your confidence, on your self-esteem, on the image you have of yourself to be constantly rejected, even treated like shit for the way you look. Yeah just be confident even though everybody brings you down! How can you have a positive image of yourself if everybody has a negative image of you? Of course people are way more than just looks, unfortunately we're all guilty of viewing people differently because of the way they look (and it can even be in certain cases hating beautiful people because of jealousy, I know I'm guilty of that sometimes).", "subreddit": "ForeverAlone"}

And the smarter you are, the more messed up your brain is, due to loneliness (cause loneliness basically destroys your brain, humans are social creatures), but it can also mean other things too: wealth, a better life later, etc. Yes, only about 2% of being rich is about intelligence and luck, and 98% is hard work, but still, generally, the smarter the person, usually the happier and the wealthier. If that isn't you, then think about your day or such, see if you're smart or not. Self-analyze yourself. Compare yourself to others. Most likely, you'll do smart things that normal people wouldn't do. If you aren't smart, then know that loneliness is something very common. 33% of adults are lonely. 10% of teens are socially isolated. A lesser percentage have chronic loneliness. So, it can't be that bad. Besides, most of us on this subreddit are lonely anyways, so we all share that.", "subreddit": "lonely"}

I didn't know what to do with it/about it due to a number of still persisting problems, but it was nice.  \n&amp;nbsp;  \nHad a few with almost certain crushes in high school. One chick in a university class start talking with me out of nowhere, did a bit of teasing possibly negging off the get go.  Another that I worked on a project with, attractive but chubby, also didn't know what to do.  Mucked both of those up.   \n&amp;nbsp;  \nI haven't seen an even slightly attractive woman look at me like any of them did about 5 years since.  I haven't fundamentally changed who I am since then, though I'm a bit more cynical when pressed, I'm just less (or not, arguably) physically attractive.  Way too fat, too bald, physically unappealing to people - and that's the first thing that matters, base attraction, people giving you a chance because they actually find you attractive.  Hell, I even had a bit of an odd thing with someone online that felt moderately deep, and I could tell just how jarring it was for them to meet me in person even before they immediately stopped talking to me online.  \n&amp;nbsp;  \nIt's hard not to feel like I blew my chance, the good thing I wasn't ready for, especially when the only people that have taken interest in me have been an even more obese woman missing most her teeth, or an unfortunately unattractive mental health day patient with obvious cognitive issues.  (Tangent, that's something that really rankles me: when people assuming less attractive people are somehow as attracted to one another as normally attractive people are.  Like no, we're still ugly, and we're not enjoying it as much as you are).  \n&amp;nbsp;  \nThe dumbest bit, though has to be that even though the whole thing leaves me feeling like crap, it's only sometimes romance I'm missing out on.  The bigger, more overwhelming part is the hit to my self esteem - realizing just how much worse people treat me, people think of me; how much less society values me for being unattractive even if I was never in a relationship.  Having the baseline of people just wanting to have things to do with you even before they find out who you are or what you think.  Giving you a base level of respect.  I'm still acting like I did while people just liked me, I still haven't learned to act as unattractive as I look - which as far as I can tell is some being a complete relationship pushover with no self respect, the only time when someone with nothing to offer has a chance.  \n&amp;nbsp;  \nWhat I'm saying, I think, is: you're right, you're correct, and what you want is totally valid.  Everyone is this way, even if 'only ever been attractive' people don't realize it.  It's weirdly almost complimentary to have people coming in and say how easy and simple it is to find someone - that we seem so normal, so well adjusted, so much like there's nothing wrong with *who* we are - 'cause it's just *what* we are that's the problem.", "subreddit": "ForeverAlone"}

Ive been reading about what people do to and most answers are \u201cHang out with friends and family and work on yourself\u201d Ok. \n\nA little bit about me.. Im an only child who lives whose only family is her mom who works all week and sleeps most weekends. Im a 20 year old girl who is transferring to CSUN in the fall .  So far my whole college experience has been bleak. Not what I imagined. Most people make new friends and memories, I felt like I just lost them. not to say that everyone else in the world is to blame but I\u2019m really awkward and get really anxious easily. So i struggle trying to make friends or even keep up a good conversation. So part of it is my own fault but Im working on it.  Being in a relationship made my friendships suffer a bit. I devoted every minute with him and took little to no time with anyone else. It was my first relationship and I was \u201cin love\u201d.  Lesson learned. \n\nI do have two friends. We have been friends since high school but our lives have become different now. We all work, I go to school and they both work full time. We all used to live next door to each other and would hang out frequently then I moved across town and now they mostly hang out with each other. So i feel left out at times. I don\u2019t have a car either and i bus everywhere so it makes it hard for me to just hang out with them whenever and i feel bad when they have to come pick me up.  I do treat them out to food or give gas money as a thank you to anyone who has to drive me around. We don\u2019t hang out as much anymore they mostly,from what i see on social media,  hang out with each other. \n\nRandom story: Today, I asked if they\u2019d want to come over to my place to hang out and dye my hair but one said she\u2019d be tired from work and the other never replied. It\u2019s okay but I feel like I don\u2019t have anyone else to ask and I don\u2019t want to be alone this weekend. The ex and I were supposed to be going to wedding near sacramento and i was looking forward to it because it would have my first trip ever and i never got to really experience something like that before. So im a bit bitter about it and want to distract myself from thinking about how much fun he\u2019s probably having... \n\nAnyways...Nowadays i\u2019m just lonely. I feel like I have no one to talk to and the world is just passing me by. I get jealous of everyone who gets to make memories with each other or their family but Im not sure how to make memories for myself?? I don\u2019t look forward to having to go out anymore and I just want to stay home and become a hermit. \n\nHow/where do you make friends? \n\nI feel like where I live its so boring and theres nothing to do and now that its going to be summer its going to be freaking hot as heck so I don\u2019t want to be busing everywhere. I am getting a car but that won\u2019t be until it\u2019s the end of summer hopefully. Idk i just want to try and have a good summer instead of moping around and crying. I wanna make friends and meet people and I guess try and grow as a person before school starts up again. So far this year has been really bad for me and I want to see how I can change it.  I dont know how i guess. \n\nThank you for taking the time to read this mess :)", "subreddit": "lonely"}

For example, my husband has depression and anxiety, and when he is having a hard time, it's hard for me to know who I can talk to/be open with. When I feel upset, I don't know where to turn, and I often wind up internalizing my thoughts and feelings, ultimately leading to feeling very alone. It used to be that I had my grandmother. Our relationship was rocky in some respects, but another thing that it was was brutally honest. I knew I could tell her almost anything, and she'd be a sounding board. But, when she passed away two years ago, that openness and honesty void way never filled by anyone else.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnother outlet I feel I no longer have is creating relationships and interacting with people online-only, often anonymously. When I was a teenager, I dabbled quite a bit in talking with random internet people. The physical disconnect made honesty and openness easier, and I got quite a lot out of those relationships. However, as I've become older, my online life has increasingly been tied to the real me/my identity (thanks a lot, social media), which has stripped the internet of many of its anonymous qualities for me.

That itself makes it difficult to get out of bed sometimes. \n\nI wonder if he misses me at all. Breakup was very mature but teary eyed from us both. Complicated situation where he isn't where he wants to be in his life, so that's why we parted. I didn't want it to end but he didn't see how he could sustain his part in the relationship with doing what he needed to do.", "subreddit": "lonely"}

I don't actually know how to have fun or what it feels like to laugh out so loud.

It\u2019s so difficult for me to relate to my peers for a lot of reasons. If I could pinpoint all the reasons, it would probably be my interests, ADHD, and circumstances lately.\n\nI guess I\u2019ll start with the interests. This will probably get taken out of context and posted to r/notlikeothergirls, but whatever. I have trouble connecting with other women. I\u2019ve been a tomboy for as long as I can remember, and I\u2019m also a big geek. I\u2019m really into rock music, guitars, and PC gaming (I play a lot of MMOs). I\u2019m either really bad or uninterested, or both, at the things many girls my age talk about. All of the girls I\u2019ve been able to actually talk to usually stick to topics like grades and who\u2019s pregnant. I don\u2019t want to sound judgmental of them for being domestic, because it\u2019s fine if they\u2019re that way! I\u2019m saying I just can\u2019t relate at all and neither of us will find meaningful connections in each other.\n\nAs for my ADHD, it makes me just bad at controlling my emotions and hyperactivity. I don\u2019t have medicine anymore either (problems with insurance). When I do make friends with someone, I get very attached because I\u2019m just not used to it. I\u2019m really bad at reading the room, so I can never tell when I\u2019m annoying people. That\u2019s when people start to distance themselves from me or outright ignore my existence. And the cycle just repeats from there.\n\nNow for the icing on the cake. I\u2019ve moved cross country twice 4 times in the past 8 years, so any lasting relationships with people have had the rug pulled out from under them. I\u2019m now homeschooled, so the possibility of making friends at school is ruled out. The only time I get the opportunity to interact with people my age (and they\u2019re not even my age since I\u2019ve failed a few grades) in real life is when I go to church. However, the conversations are very surface level because as I stated before, I don\u2019t relate to the girls in my youth group at all. I\u2019ve only had one actually meaningful friendship in my life, and that went out the window when he killed himself. I haven\u2019t gotten over it despite it being 3 years. \n\nI\u2019m starting to believe that I\u2019m a freakish NEET who is destined to be lonely.

Some were rejected dozens of times. Some were rejected hundreds of times. I know older FA'ers are a minority compared to people under 25, but there still are a lot of them. Some older FA'ers escape FA past 30 and I'm happy for them. Some older FA'ers find happiness being FA by doing other things. If they are happy, that's what matters. Also, this can go for the FA'er in his mid 20's who is exhausted from failure. I'm not saying the 25 year old FA'er should give up but that it's okay to have the urge after failing so many times.\n\nYou try for so many years and fail. Eventually you give up. It's natural to give up after failing for so many years. When you vent, sometimes here, sometimes in other places, there will always be people who cling onto the just world fallacy who will shame you. They will try to say without knowing you that you must have either not tried hard enough, did everything wrong, or never tried and just want to complain. Some people can't accept that while some find success, some never do. They can't accept that someone tries but fails. Good things happen to good people. If you failed, you are obviously a bad person. If they don't shame you saying you didn't try hard enough, they will say it's because you are a bad person. They do mental gymnastics because they refuse to believe someone can try and fail every single time. \n\nIf you are a person who vents because they tried for so long but failed every single time, know that those people who shame you don't know you. They will try to pick apart every detail of your venting and demand to know the color of the shirt you wore to a date 10 years ago. They need to find something in the story to say, see, that's why you failed. They will build strawmen by using venting from things that happened years ago and saying that's how you always wore. No wonder why you were rejected. With an attitude like that, you will get rejected. \n\nIf you tried your hardest and failed, never let people shame you. You know you tried your best. These people who 90% of the time don't even know what it's like to be FA although some claim they do because they were single for a year, don't know your experiences and will try to make lots of assumptions about you. Stand up to those people and say, I know I did my best. Obviously you didn't do everything right. Everyone makes mistakes and those people will try to mistakes that everyone makes into the reason you are FA. They will shame you for giving up by saying if you want to sit there and wallow in self pity instead of going out to do something about it, nothing will ever change for you. Just say, okay, thanks for your opinion. Don't let them gaslight you by getting you to question your memories. They weren't there. They can only make assumptions based off of stories you say while venting. They will say they just want to help but most of the time they just want to feel better about themselves. There are people who do want to actually help and this isn't about them. It's about the people who just want to shame FA'ers to show their non-FA friends how they tried to help those FA losers.

Everyone I've ever met has had the notion that I was this weird kid instilled into them by other kids at school. I was always looked at as that one quiet kid who hardly ever talks and has little to no social skills. I had a small group of friends and I was always going in and out of the Principals Office on the daily for stupid remarks that I would make.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI never really had a high school experience... or any school experience for that matter. I always avoided clubs and large groups because I was always looked down upon and I would never ever want to talk to new people because everyone had already gotten a bad first impression of me due to what other people would say about me. I felt so isolated at times. I felt as if I was in a deep dark corner by myself. No one knew what it was like not being able to go to certain parts of the campus without feeling the need to look over my shoulder since I was always targeted and blamed for mischief by this group of people who'd I'd consider to be the \"bad kids\" since they were honestly a group of pothead fuck ups that I had gotten into lots of feuds with throughout Middle School.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFor my 10th grade year, I moved to a new high school (which was literally right across from my old one on the same campus) since I wanted to start fresh and actually get respected for once. I felt so accepted and people actually saw me in a good way. I met new friends.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnd I had even met this one girl (Let's just call her Alice) who I had 10th grade chem class with in my old school that I attended before I got locked up and she was very... loose?... to say the least.. I had sat next to her in class and I always heard her talking to the guys and girls around me about very sexual topics such as preferring her male partners having a smaller penis so she could have oral sex with ease and whatnot.. One day she told me she had a fetish for skinny guys (I was a 115lbs 5;7\" twig at the time) and I had honestly just cringed.. I crawled into my hoodie and felt so awkward about it, but I actually felt like hitting on her because why not I guess!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOn October 24th 2017, 2 weeks after my 15th birthday, I was held in custody in a Juvenile Detention Center for various charges including Accessory in Robbery. Rumors were spread around my old school, and I was apparently feared by a good amount of people from what others had told me. During this time, I felt as if I had nobody. I met lots of new people in the foster home / rehab that I was in and they always teased me for being \"afraid of pussy\" (I was rather quiet and very honest about how far I had gotten with my past girlfriends). And I honestly saw it as a wake up call. I felt so ready to get out and go back home and try to do what I thought I had been missing out on when it came to the opposite sex.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n(Fast Forward 6 months to when I served my sentence)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOnce I had gotten out I felt so determined to meet new people and maybe even get a girlfriend and have my first serious long term relationship now that I felt as if I've grown up and I felt much more mature.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI met this one girl (Let's just call her Alice) who I had 10th grade chem class with in my old school that I attended before I got locked up and she was very... loose?... to say the least.. I had sat next to her in class and I always heard her talking to the guys and girls around me about very sexual conversations such as preferring her male partners having a smaller penis and whatnot..\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI didn't really know her all that much, and I honestly didn't think she was all that bad, so to make a long story short, I ended up falling for her really hard, and she wasn't open to having any sort of relationship with me. She ended up hooking up with an adult considering the fact that she is still a minor and I just had to pull myself together and move on.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI had blocked Alice on social media on September 1st of 2018 so I could get over her completely, and sometime around 20 days later, I had started talking to someone who I had known about that I had 3 classes in back in my Freshman year of High School. For the purpose of this, I'm going to call her Jade. Jade was different, she was older than most students in her grade and she seemed very nice and outgoing. She was one of those people who talked to everyone since she liked company. Jade had always tried to talk to me in English class but I was too shy and when we started talking on social media, she'd always tease me about me staring at the floor in a playful way. She had told me that I reminded her of her sister's ex boyfriend and that the moment she had layed eyes in me, she wanted to know everything about me, (she would constantly try to give me signals but I was completely unaware. She admitted to having a crush on me way later on)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI thought it was cute and I honestly really liked her since she didn't really mind all of the rumors people had made about me and the stories about me getting incarcerated. I liked how she could look past all of that and accept me for who I was. (She did this for everyone, so it was a cure and a blessing at the same time... More on that later...) I ended up talking to her a lot more and we ended up flirting with each other, and I eventually made her my girlfriend.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe ended up opening up a lot more about her older sister who had passed away when Jade was in the 7th grade, and she told me how her sister's ex boyfriend stuck around with her family in order to support them and Jade emotionally. (Lets call this man Raymond)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAt the time of Jade's sister's passing, this man was 16, and he himself passed away in a car crash 5 months prior to me talking to her over social media when he was only 19 and serving the country if I am not mistaken, and right off the bat I felt weird... she had told me how Jade and Raymond had gotten very close to each other despite the creepy age gap...\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnd she told me lots of stories about how she and him would cuddle and watch movies together, she even opened up to me and told me about both him and her were high on the couch watching a movie and they had accidentally ended up making out, and he had bit her lip so hard to the point where it bled... Which at first got me furious to think about, and I expressed it very thoroughly with her and she had apologized for sharing such a disturbing memory with me. I asked her if she had any feelings for him before his passing, and she would always say no.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe even ended up telling me that if I didn't text her or try to contact her at around the same time that I ended up doing so, she would have most likely committed suicide from the anxiety and sadness... which I had no comment on...\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe told me he tried to ask her out at one point, but she declined the offer because it seemed so messed up and disgusting.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe had always compared me to this man... and how I reminded her of him so much... I mean.. hell, I even wore the same cologne as him coincidentally... And it had always creeped me the fuck out..\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe was very different from me, but I still managed to connect to her, despite the differences in interests, hobbies, and music. It was so strange having someone stick around with me for so long since I had never been in that long of a relationship before in my life. I had shared so much with her and she had noticed that other people would treat me like shit, and I felt so accepted by Jade. I loved her so much.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI had texted her for about 5 whole months without seeing her once because we went to different schools. I just decided to grow a pair and tell my mom that she was just a friend and I would like to go to her house, so I did just that. On March 8th 2019, I got so fucking high to the point where my heartbeat felt it would play ping pong with my rib cage, and every time it beat, it felt so numb and fuzzy. I saw her walking out of her house and I felt shocked... I just felt as I were falling in love all over again. I saw how short she was compared to me (I'm 5 foot 10, and she's 4 foot 11) and I just smiled so hard and hugged her... I felt so happy.. and immediately, we started talking and teasing each other. There wasn't any awkward silences or anything... I felt as if I was made for this person. I had a tour around her house and my heart stopped when I saw a photo of Raymond on a shelf near her TV.. I brushed it off and just ignored it.. We walked around her neighborhood and I had started hugging her and just admiring her.. I treated her like a queen...\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe had sat down in her porch after a long long walk and it was around 9:30 pm, so it had already been dark. She played the music she listened to (Marilyn Manson, Shiloh Dynasty, Joji, etc...) and I honestly vibed so well with her.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo I guess I had started to kiss her hands and neck, then I started thinking about how I had never really kissed my previous girlfriends.. I had always kissed girls in the way that I'd kiss a relative or something (lol) So we both leaned in with our eyes closed and I kissed her right then and there. It was hands down one of the most beautiful nights I have ever had in my life with someone.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe had texted me when I had gotten home about how she was scared about me going home because her and Raymond used to cuddle. And I felt so sorry for her loss..\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOne month later, she had started to act very very distant from me. When I'd try to express a concern with her, she'd reply with a \"...\" or a \"-\\_-\" and it honestly pissed me off.. She had shown me someone named Henry on her Instagram that was bothering her, asking her for nude pictures. She blocked him right in front of my face, and a week later she sent me a screenshot of a meme she saw, and she had a notification from Henry on Snapchat. So I asked her, and she had lied to me, telling me it was a \"Jimmy\" that she had blocked. My blood fucking boiled. I didn't really mind her talking to some fuck boy, but I got mad at the fact that she'd lie to me like that.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI even heard stories of her male friends at school trying to undress her as a joke. Which got me pissed off because she must have been giving them the inclination to act that way considering the fact that she was an outgoing person who forgave people very easily, and she'd basically let people walk all over her. Which I had always tried to tell her not to do, but then she'd throw a big fucking fit.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOn May 17th 2019, I had the worst date I have ever had in my entire life. I went to her house and the light from her eyes had vanished. She was acting so disrespectful and I had not seen her in a whole month. I sat down on a bench near a museum with her and she didn't want to kiss me, let alone even hug me. I got so furious seeing this sort of behavior from her, I didn't even want to tell her because I thought it was just all my head, and I thought I was being immature about it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe told me she had to make me leave 2 hours earlier than usual, and top it all off, she was ignoring me the entire time, and I felt so disappointed. She gave me two letters that were so bland and basic. They were in black ink on white printer paper in cursive. I felt so cheated and played. I understand that young love dies out pretty often, but this just seemed so cold. I felt as if I wasn't a good enough replacement for this Raymond guy... And I felt so used.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA day after she had told me she wanted to break up with me since she felt so distant from me, and felt as if we had nothing in common, when she insisted that we were very compatible at first. I felt so mad, and I accepted her friendship afterwards for two days since she told me that she might possibly return back to me if she felt as if it was \"the right thing to do\". I wasn't going to simp and chase after a girl. So 2 days later, I tell her this isn't going to work, and even if you take me back, you'll only do the same thing again.. She had replied with \"Ok.......\" and then replied with a kiss emoji an hour later which I left on read for obvious reasons.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe tried to text me 3 days ago, telling me how her friend said she should check up on me, which I found very shitty because she didn't even worry at her own fucking will.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnd last night I put the puzzle pieces together and realized what she saw in me... It was only because I was a replacement for her. I feel as if she used me for emotional support.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI guess I wasn't a good enough replacement for this dead guy. I hate him with a passion... But I feel as if I have no space for hate in my heart. I just want to move on.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\ntl;dr: I befriended a girl who accepted me for who I was despite the fact that she heard lots of rumors about me going to jail and being an outcast, I made her my girlfriend, and she was only into me because I reminded her heavily about an older friend who I believe she had a crush on, but then became cold and distant when she realized I wasn't the same as him. Now I lost a friend who actually seemed to care alot about me... I just want friends", "subreddit": "lonely"}

I haven't seen them in a long time, so maybe it's less about them and more about the idea of being with someone. I've definitely done that before. I had developed feelings for a girl, but then the next time I hung out with her I didn't feel the attraction I built up in my head. Anyway, regardless of that, I recently started having feelings for a friend of mine. She is incredibly attractive, way out of my league, but I did that thing I always do where I start day dreaming about her... imagining us together... and all that really gets my hopes up that it could work. I have to remind myself that I'm ugly and socially awkward and unlovable. It hurts, but it hurts less than it would if I got rejected, as I have in the past. I don't wanna go through that again. Last time I was rejected really kicked off the worst year of my life. I was a miserable mess. Furthermore, I don't want to ruin the friendship I have with her or the friendship my other friends have with her and/or me. I'm probably happier just forgetting about it and continuing to be alone.", "subreddit": "ForeverAlone"}

Obviously, I would never ever enter such a relationship as it is a waste of money and time. To my surprise, I saw plenty of chicks that I know of who were of different ages, educational levels, ethnicity, etc. I was honestly stunned and out of words when I saw the number of girls that were there. From the chicks you would expect to be there to \"good\" religious girls whom I would have never ever imagined to be there. The funny thing is that some of these girls are actually well off financially and have relatively rich parents. Others are not and have I guess better reasons why they are there. Also I should clarify that the vast majority of the girls there are basically glorified escorts in the sense that they will have sex with their sugar daddies. I am actually really disappointed that some of the girls that I really liked are there.\n\nAnyhow, my point is that I can guarantee you that you will find someone you know there! From girls you would expect there to some who will stun you. Opening a fake account is super easy by the way and you don't have to pay. \n\nWhat are your views on this? Do you still believe you may eventually find someone good? Would you ever get a sugar baby assuming you had financial means to do so?", "subreddit": "ForeverAlone"}
