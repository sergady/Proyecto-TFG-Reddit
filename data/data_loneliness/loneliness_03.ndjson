When I was in college I had trouble making connections and meeting people, and I used to frequent this subreddit and talk to people.  Since then, I moved to a new state and made really great friends and also had a wonderful relationship that lasted almost 3 years.  \n\nAnyway, I wanted to bring up something I occasionally see talked about here and other places.  A guy opens up about how lonely he is, and how he's never had a relationship or kissed a girl.  He then mentions that he's had a few opportunities to be in a relationship with a couple of women, but didn't want to because the women were overweight.  Immediately, he gets a lot of flak for saying this.  He may be told that he is a horrible person who deserves to be alone for being so shallow.\n\nI think this is totally the wrong mentality to have towards anyone, foreveralone or not.  It's okay to pass up an opportunity to be with someone if you know that they aren't right for you.  And it's okay to still feel lonely and alone after passing up such an opportunity.\n\nIt's okay to have preferences and standards for yourself.  If you're a woman and don't want to be with a man who's shorter than you, that is okay.  It is no one else's business.  Not the man you rejected, and certainly not society's.  If you don't want to be with a man who is bald, that is okay.  I am bald myself, and know that a lot women find that unattractive.  It used to bother me, but I take comfort that there are women who find bald men sexy.\n\nNow there's a practical part of all of this.  You have to be reasonable about your preferences, look hard about where you're willing to bend them, and be willing to accept the consequences.  If you're an average looking guy who is only willing to take 9s and 10s, there are consequences to that.  If you're a 6 foot 3 woman and being with someone shorter than you really bothers you, there are consequences to that too.  If you're fat and can't stand the thought of being with someone who's fat..you should think about that.  ", "subreddit": "ForeverAlone"}

She was a part of my friend group, you could say the leader of the group sort of. We would hang out quite a lot and things were okay. But basically, she got jealous and annoyed that I had actually set boundaries with her. She began to invite the others to do things without inviting me. I learned this from their social media, which we all followed each other on, because they posted pictures. She said she was tired of my \"toxic negative energy\" basically she was tired of someone else getting attention and sympathy because she's not the only one with problems (this all happened last semester, I had mono and she couldn't stand someone else getting attention, even implied I was faking). I always listened to her talk about her problems but I couldn't talk about mine. She was definitely talking shit to other people about me, too. I tried to keep hanging out with them but I just kept getting left out and ignored. I also always had to text first with this group of people but I thought, whatever, at least I have friends right?

I worked out ways and mechanisms in the past to counter it, I really try to apply them but its hard to change old and establish new habits. Some times it works better than other times.\n\nI think too early after my Dad died I met my now ex-girlfriend. I could focus a lot on making her happy instead of focus on my own improvement. I forgot myself in the relationship and was happy about it because I didn't want to think about what the fuck I actually have to do now where Dad is gone and Im just 22/23.        \n\nIn February I went to some self-help group. That was weird. But I think it actually was better being there than another lonely evening of web browsing. One time there already gave me some \"tools\" I try to work with. I want to go again this month.      \n\nEarlier this week I failed my driving exam. One of the few things I tried in a long time. Afterwards the examiner said that at first he thought I was joking but then was afraid of his life. lol. Why the fuck do I pay driving teacher money when he doesn't actually teach me to drive and sends me to test like that.     \n\nI think start of my process of becoming a man again instead of being a lonely, stoned slug is to take responsibility.       \n\nI fucked up the exam. I will go back to learning and try again soon. Focus on the future.       \n\nBut one of the big problems I have is that there is just so much time to fill and nobody to share with. Does happiness even exist when there is nobody to share it with? Next week new semester begins and a few weeks ago I started to run and swim a bit again. Both lonely activity but its improvement. Improving everyday a little. What do I want this week, in the next 10 weeks, where do I see myself in 6 months?      \n\n\n\nI will stop here. Sorry for wall of text, anyone actually reads this far? :D     \n\n\n\nTL;DR: Am 25, lonely as fuck. Dad died 3 years ago, gf of 2 years left, I moved out from my roommates in bad terms and isolated myself. Hit rockbottom for a few month. Just starting to try to better myself. Looking forward.", "subreddit": "lonely"}

{"post_id": "aw4m6f", "created_utc": 1551445209, "title": "Pretty long and sort of complicated backstory", "author": "rubesboo", "self_text": "So long story short; I'm 31 weeks pregnant, I don't know who BD is, my sister is adopting the baby, my current boyfriend knows all of this and also happens to be going through some serious medical issues. I don't feel like I'm not getting the affection and intimacy I NEED during pregnancy, but I also feel like I can't complain to my boyfriend because he has his own stuff going on and he didn't sign up for this pregnancy in any way. \n\nLong story long....\nMy boyfriend and I have an on and off history and while we were broken up in the summer of 2018, I unknowingly got pregnant. He and I had contact and still occasionally hung out during this time, but we weren't together by any means. Fast forward to January 25th of this year; I get a snapchat from him telling me he's in the hospital and his legs don't work. I immediately think he's making a bad joke or something, come to find out he's very serious. So I go and see him in the hospital. Later that same day, a conversation with my sister leads me to take a pregnancy test and it comes back positive. I tell my boyfriend, we start getting excited thinking it could be his and sort of \"officially\" get back together. I find out it's not his, and he is understandably disappointed and a little hurt, but still supportive of whatever I want to do. A few more days go by and he decides if I keep the baby, he doesn't want to be with me, all of which I can totally 100% understand and empathize with. This is about the time my sister and her husband mention to me that they could potentially adopt, as they wanted to adopt another child anyway and this seemed like fate. Mind you, I'm NOT ready to be a parent in any capacity. So at this point in time boyfriend is still in the hospital (with what they had now diagnosed as transverse myelitis), I'm very pregnant, my sister is adopting, and everything seems like it's going to work out okay. \n\nFast forward to last night...\nSister is still adopting and everything with the pregnancy is going normally and well. My boyfriend is home from the hospital, still wheelchair bound and has minimal use of his legs, but is expected to make a full recovery, just based on time and how hard he works at his physical therapy. He's a pretty reserved person, not incredibly affectionate, and when he is it's mostly sexual. Annoying to me, but whatever, I'm pretty used to it. But last night he starts talking about how he feels like he doesn't have the emotional capacity to love me the way I love him and how I deserve so much better, and he's always thought he was meant to be alone. Then he said he just needed to go and think and that he loves me. Now, I don't need to hear about how I'm wasting my time and how I deserve better or that he's literally TELLING me that I deserve better. Nobody is perfect and our relationship is not going to be perfect. We both have had traumatic childhoods, mothers are narcissists/sociopaths, we barely know our bio. dads, so both of us have some learned behaviors that we are both actively trying to break away from to be healthier people for ourselves and also for each other.\nMy main point is that especially because I'm pregnant and hormonal, I'm feeling particularly vulnerable right now and just want/need more of an emotional and intimate connection than I'm getting. BUT, I feel sort of guilty complaining about it because he is currently going through something fairly traumatic between losing his leg function, finding out his girlfriend is pregnant by someone else, and having to be pretty much housebound unless I come and get him and take him out (because I have experience with paralysis and home health care, fortunately). And all of this while already dealing with OBVIOUS depression and probable anxiety.\n\nI guess I mostly just wanted to vent about this, because I know what I SHOULD be doing about it, what I WANT to do about it, and what I'm GOING to do about it. So I'm not really even looking for advice. I just feel freaking alone. \ud83d\ude15", "subreddit": "lonely"}

First of all this friend of my cousin who found my account, I never met her, never talked to her, don't even know what she looks like... so why is she pointing out my account she shouldnt even know me... this makes me think that my cousin probably makes fun of me to her friends behind my back. When I found out she makes fun of her brother to her friends, I am sure she does the same to me. \n\nSecondly, this girl that found me, well we never matched so that means she swiped left on me... and that was really hurtful. Because think about it, that means she saw my profile, her and my cousin probably laughed about how unattractive I am, probably cringed at the thought of me as a sexual being, and then swiped left...Like think about how really ugly you have to be for that to happen...", "subreddit": "ForeverAlone"}

I've been struggling with social anxiety most of my life (I remember first realizing I had a problem when I was 10 or so). Luckily I've been really lucky in several situations and managed to make a couple of friends in my dorm in college and a couple an an old job, and just switched to a job where everyone is really friendly.\n\nI used to have trouble talking to people at all, even in non-social situations (calling to order a pizza, going to a store I wasn't familiar with, etc). I also was really upset that I couldn't engage in some of my hobbies because of not having anyone to do them with (rock climbing, backpacking).\n\nI've gotten a little better, and have been able to go climbing with people and hang out with coworkers after work and such.\n\nMy problem is that even with all that I still feel really lonely. I like being around people but outside of very structured situations like a planned trip or something I still don't really know how to interact with people. In some ways doing these things makes me feel worse because interacting with other people makes me realize how easy it is for other people to make friends, and how they mean so much more to me than I do to them. Like hanging out with my coworkers, it's nice at the time but they always mention parties they've been to or their significant others or whatever, stuff that I'm happier just pretending don't exist.\n\nIt feels like all of my interactions with people are so superficial. It's always talking about the subject at hand (climbing if on a climbing trip, for example). Part of the problem is that I don't really know what I want. I feel disconnected from people and upset but I don't know why being around people doesn't help.\n\nSometimes when I'm with my coworkers I'll feel a little bit close to them (commiserating about some work thing or something) but then they'll mention something about how they just had a birthday party or something, or I'll remember that I don't have their phone number and they seem total disinterested in me, and I remember that they aren't really my friends, they're only talking to me because I'm there.\n\nSorry for the rambling wall of text, I'm kind of drunk.

{"post_id": "aweywf", "created_utc": 1551509231, "title": "You guys need to be more like me", "author": "Anotherguy783", "self_text": "Hi, I am in a relationship which makes me qualified to give you advice on how to escape being FA. I know how difficult it can be. I was like you guys until I changed who I am. I went from FA to happily in a relationship and I am nice enough to share with you how I escaped FA because I am a pretty awesome guy.\n\nA random fact about me is that S is my favorite letter of the alphabet. I also really like turtle/s. Yes, growing up I loved turtle/s.\n\nThe first thing that you need to change is that you need to shower regularly. I know most of you rarely shower if at all. Nobody wants to be around a smelly sammy. I'm so funny. You should probably shower at least once a day. You would be surprised how much of a positive that alone it is to not smell bad. You probably should leave the basement you live in. Nobody wants to be around a basement dweller. Make sure to dress well. I'm sure most of you wear trash bags as an outfit with sandwich bags as shoes. Instead, try putting on real clothes. Make sure to get a haircut. My friend was an ugly Uylses until he got a haircut. Now he constantly has women flirt with him. \n\nI met my current girlfriend from a mutual friend who introduced us when my group of friends went out and he brought her along and we hit it off after only a couple of hours. I know, some of you don't have any friends. Well, that's no reason to be a negative nelly because it's very easy to make new friends. Join a Meetup group because I'm sure you have popular hobbies. The people in those groups are always anxious to meet new people. Now, don't go just to meet people. They can see if you are just going there to meet people instead of having a passion for the hobby. You should only go because of your passion for the hobby. You should also look into volunteering. It shows how great of a person you are when you volunteer. You should have no trouble meeting people volunteering but don't be silly and just go to meet people. They can sense that you are only volunteering to meet people and that will turn them off. \n\nI'm sure some of you have tried your darned hardest with dating sites but if you haven't had success, it's probably because you tried too hard. People can tell if you are trying too hard and will be turned off by it. Write a profile that shows that not only are you an interesting person, but you should take at least five pictures of yourself with your friends or on vacation. It shows people that you like to travel which is a unique hobby. People don't like seeing pictures of guys alone. If you post pictures of you and your friends, it will get people to say, that guy must have something going right for him to be popular. \n\nI know the elephant in the room is looks. The truth is, looks don't matter and I know some of you will disagree. It's all about your personality because having a good sense of humor for example will turn you from unattractive to attractive. I have friends who aren't very attractive but they have girlfriends. My one friend is 5'5\" and has a girlfriend. Height doesn't matter. His high paying job isn't a big deal. She saw his personality and now they are a happy couple.\n\nI don't mean to humblebrag but the last thing I want to bring up is how great my relationship with my girlfriend is. See, you have to be understanding to women and not feel entitled to sex. That's one of the big problems I see here. Guys here think that just because they go out once in a while that they are entitled to relationships with women. We are entitled to things like free college, a $30 an hour minimum wage, full time benefits and the wealthy paying 99% income tax to pay for it. We are not entitled to sex or companionship. \n\nOnce of my biggest hurdles is that my girlfriend is asexual. We don't have sex but I don't let get in the way of our relationship. She actually loves to cuddle. She even cuddles with other guys. I am sure to leave them alone during their cuddling time. The other day my girlfriends lonely friend brought four other guys to his cuddling session with her. So many guys are lonely and it's good my girlfriend is giving those guys the cuddling that helps them feel better. Her main cuddle partner told me because of the amount of guys needing to cuddle, I should go out and gave me a gift card to Starbucks! I took my Macbook to Starbucks and spend a couple of hours there drinking my favorite latte, while eating a couple of scones. A couple hours later my girlfriend called me saying the cuddling session was over. She sounded tired I'm sure from so much cuddling. I'm sure it can be exhausting. I respect my girlfriends asexuality and have a great relationship. That's why I'm so qualified to give you all advice. If it can work for an average Andy like myself, I'm sure it can work for all of you.\n\n\nThis is a couple bad nights coming out in a vent. I hope I didn't offend any of you.

It makes me even more depressed knowing that I haven\u2019t slept with anyone at all, I\u2019m a virgin and have always thought of having my first time with someone I truly love. I can never explore that type of intimacy freely without constantly getting anxious if I\u2019m going to risk transmitting it to my potential partner or not.

I was delving into the unknown and I felt prepared but how ready can you really be for something like that?  I ate them and they were disgusting and tasted foul. Nothing happened for quite a while either, but when they started it didn\u2019t take long for me to realize some things about myself when I was talking to my friend. \n\n So like I said I never had a girl in Hs and I realized I never actually tried either. In my head i tried as hard as I could but to both my friends and the girls they had no idea I was even trying. The truth was I was scared. I was scared of consequences that would never have a chance of happening cause I never went for it because I was insecure about how I looked and felt like a monster. \n\n  It seemed like I could never seem to get her attention but it\u2019s because in my head I had all these feelings but I expressed them to others at about .1% of the rate I felt them at.  \n\n  I also came to terms with the fact that I was fat and that being fat is a negative trait in most people\u2019s eyes and it is not helping with a good first impression.  \n\nSo I decided to try for once.

Instead, he chose to sit there staring at her and not say anything.\n\n\n\nWe know he spoke English fine because the test he was taking was written entirely in it. He just chose to not reply and that's what's upsetting\n\n\n\nHe seemed like a normie (*REEEEEEEE*), so it baffled me at the moment. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt's just **recently**, after being with my current work for a year, that I've made friends that wanna play video games with me after they get off of work. It's a nice escape-- and yes, I know : not everyone has this opportunity so please don't think I'm bragging. \n\n\n\nWhat I'm saying is it took a long time of just trying my damnest not to be a big pile of fail like I normally am and just play cool. Fake it till you make it, I guess (?) \n\n\n**TL;DR**\n\n\nBut if you're anything like the new guy I explained above, you're gonna need some hobbies to help make your social portfolio. Here are some socially acceptable things:\n\n- MMA (I've been told some girls think this is hot \u00af\\\\\\_(\u30c4)_/\u00af )\n- Fishing\n- Hiking\n- Working out \n- Reading (Works more for women than it does guys) \n- Sports, so long as it's not bowling or golf \n- SHOWERING IS NOT A HOBBY\n\n\n\nI might have missed a few but bare with me, it's been a while since I've taken up a new hobby", "subreddit": "ForeverAlone"}

I don't know if I should call them \"relationships\" because I never felt safe and sound in anyone of them except my last one. My experiences so far: People just want to be with you as long as you provide a home, money and food. As soon as you want them to participate in your life together, they are gone. This happend in nearly all of my so called relationships. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\----- The following text is for better understanding why I think like this. If you are annoyed by personal \"whining\" - skip it---  \n\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy first \"girlfriend\" at the age of 14(? Can't really remember if I was 14 or a bit older) was... interesting. Although if I look back at this time, I was young. And I think it's natural if your first \"SO\" in life is not the last one. Well, we broke up since she fell for my best bud back then and just stopped talking to me.\n\nMy next three or four relationships were mostly the same. \"Teeny\" relationships, nothing serious. I was the \"vehicle\" to get in contact with other people around me. Then I met HER. Guys... never fall for a woman which has mental issues. It all started with me seeing her on a concert. She lost her wallet and was looking for it. I found it earlier and gave it back to her. She had a black eye and a few other \"marks\" on her which made me curious about how that happened. We talked a lot and I met her \"boyfriend\" - A retard which treated her like... well, not very good. \n\nWe became friends and after some quite unpleasant events including the police she finally left her \"better\" half and moved on. About half a year later we were a couple. \n\nOn this point: Guys (and Girls) NEVER form a relationship out of mercy and because you want to help someone.\n\nAnyways it moved on for about a year or so and things were ok. She had some issues and I could understand them (I was 20 at this time). Things like not sleeping with me 'cause her ex forced her and tortured her in bed etc.\n\nA few weeks later I found out that she was sleeping with her ex. I wanted to pick her up after workand saw her jumping into the car with her ex. I drove home, tried to call her several times and she told me that she was just getting \"some stuff\" from him which were still at his home. \n\nLater that day I had a long talk with her best friend, and I had no Idea. She had a mental illness and was seeing her ex the whole time we were together. I was her \"waste pile\" to get her problems off while her ex was the one she was sleeping with. - Of course I broke up with her. \n\nBig Mistake. It took me another year to finally get away from her. She was stalking me hurting herself and blamed it on me, and in the end she hurt me with the words \"If you ever leave me again I kill you\". \n\nAs I already said, in the end I got away from her.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe next four years I stayed for myself. Until I met him. I never considered a guy as my SO in my life, I never had any thoughts on same-sex relationships, but he was... cute. We talked a lot until I flew around half of the world to meet in person and soon we became a couple. I moved. We lived together for almost a year until the government made it impossible for me to stay longer. With enough money I could have bought a visa, but that time, 4000$ or 4 million dollars, both would be the same. So we both moved back to europe and got married. I knew him for two years and I thought I found the one I could settle down and get old with.\n\nFor the next three years we were living together. I got work at a good company, earned good money and slowly we could build up a life together. Well. more I build up a life for us. He was sitting at home, playing games all day long and I felt more and more like a provider for food, home and internet. I did the cooking, the chores, everything.\n\nOver the three years I constantly asked to help up a bit. Doing chores, learn to cook. And most importantly: learning the language. I did not expect much, just to see that our relationship and I am important in any way, but all I see was a person, totally caught up in online worlds, talking to people he would never meet. I felt like his online friends were more important than me. \n\nThen I told him I can't go on line that anymore. His parents always nagged us for him to come back and visit them, so we decided he fly back and take a vacation. Also for us to get some space and think about how things should go on. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWell... I waited for another two years. Constantly hearing \"I am coming back after my brother birthday. I come back after Christmas. I am coming back after dads 50th, I am coming back after nanas 75th birthday....\" and so on.\n\nLast year I made a point and asked straight away if he ever wants to come back to me, because after two years I don't want to hear another \"I am coming back after...\". \n\nAnd he said no. He never wanted to come back and started dating someone else. So I filed in for a divorce. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis was last year in June. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI quit work about 2 weeks after this and started a new job. I moved to a new appartment and went on. Of course it hurts, but I needed to get out of that job, that home which always remembered me at the failed relationship. \n\nIn September I started dating again. I have my 33rd birthday this year - And I give up.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\-----\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFrom what I experienced so far (I know I am generalizing things):\n\nPeople don't want to open up to me. I am good as long as I am having a job, earn money and have a home. But really \"being together\" seems like something totally extraordinary. \n\nMost \"dating apps\" and websites I had a look at are mostly a \"Whom I am going to fuck today\" instead of a so called \"dating\" app.\n\nIf you go out and try to meet people, you are \"creepy\" and just want to hook up and fuck. \n\nOne evening I was sitting in a pub with a Friend and I got called \"stingy\" because I did not paid for a drink for a woman which sat down next to me. She did not talk to me, just sit there and waited for me to buy her a drink. (After five minuted she got up and walked away, telling her friends in a loud voice to stay away from that \"stingy\" guy over there)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\-----\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow, I give up.\n\nI start minding my own business. Doing my job, earn good money and live my own life.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I doing wrong?", "subreddit": "lonely"}

I dont know if it has something to do with my relationship status where at 28 years of my existence I never had any relationship with opposite sex. It is not because I am super ugly or has an attitude. I have suitors in the past but ended up rejecting them because I was too busy improving my education and myself and now I regret it. In the previous years, I focus myself on studying and making my parents proud of me because I know that it will make them happy. I saw how they really struggle to send me to  school even when they are struggling financially. That's why I'd tried my best to  excel in various fields. In fact I became a scholar, graduated with flying colors, and was hired instantly and was given a stable job where most people in my field are aiming to have it. But I dont know if I should be proud of  it,as I was  busy improving myself I ended up rejecting a lot of suitors since highschool thinking it wouldn't do good to me or I wouldn't be good enough for them.yes it was so harsh to do that to them, but my younger me has a different perspective that time due to poverty, lack of experiences and most of the time I was at home studying and doing chores. I was never the teenager who go out and go drinking with friends because literally I dont have the money to go out with them. I thought by focusing on my dreams I would become happy and contented in the future. But myself now are regretting some things that I  never never done before like a teenager should have experienced like going out with friends,dating someone, etc. Thinking about it  felt like I grew up in a different way or abnormal way with this. And right now, after all the hard work I've done and after the success I have  I'd still feel like I will never be good enough to everyone (opposite sex). It feels like I will be so vulnerable and i think no one would love me with my flaws and it is so heartbreaking whenever my friends or colleagues told me their love story and I can't even share one. It feels like I'm the ugliest person in the world. If only I can go back in that stage, I should have dated someone. I should have say yes to one of  those good suitors that I had before. It feels like I already lose my oppurtunity to have a good partner after rejecting them. My current job also  hinder me to meet potential partner now. Most of my time is spent working with kids and other related activities. While most of my friends and batchmates are already married and have kids, I'd still remain single.

I got admitted to a hospital and had to go to multiple therapy sessions which did help but I have this lingering thought in the back of my head. The problems in my life are because of me and how I am. I get too angry, I\u2019m quick to jump to conclusions. I\u2019m hard headed, no empathy, not that friendly and overall just bad in social situations.\n\nI\u2019ve identified this and started to make goals towards improving myself the ways I can. Started a savings account, went back to the gym, started to invest into a new car. Clean my apartment top to bottom, quit going out to eat and started to eat at home. When I\u2019m at work I stopped talking and did more sitting back to observe people. All of my social problems is due to my lack of change that is needed when going to new places or meeting new people.\n\nThe friends I managed to get were deleted from my contacts and I stopped all contact. Not because they did something wrong but because I\u2019m the something wrong. I\u2019m not a good person and I\u2019ve addressed it and looked into the mirror. I don\u2019t deserve friendship or love until I fix myself and it\u2019s going to be a long road to get there. I\u2019ve mostly always been alone in my life and there\u2019s a relaxing atmosphere that comes with it. But when I go to places or restaurants I sit alone quietly while other people are happy with their friends.\n\nI look to my sides sometimes and a forced smile comes on my face, I want friends but I don\u2019t deserve them. My new goal by next year is to be a respectable human that can show compassion and empathy. This is most likely the hardest thing I\u2019ll do in my life, the last couple of days is a struggle. Paying attention to every little thing I do and say to break habits that kept me alone for so long. This wasn\u2019t a pity story just somewhere to put down and let others see and think to themselves.\n\nI\u2019m not saying you\u2019re the reason for your problems but sit down and evaluate how you act and talk to others. Watch others that seem to have friends and have successful social interactions. See what they do and how different people react, there\u2019s a trend that I\u2019m starting to notice and adopting myself. People say to be yourself but there\u2019s always room for improvement.

{"post_id": "axhizc", "created_utc": 1551764250, "title": "Conversations", "author": "Yapoz", "self_text": "So on Thursday I rolled with this girl at jiu-jitsu. She was really pretty, really smart, and just dozens of leagues above me in every way, shape, or form. But talking to her was really easy. It was really weird talking to a charismatic person. The conversation just flows, and no matter what you say, they seem interested and animated. Compare that to my monotone, quiet voice and the fact that I can't carry on a conversation for shit. Even when I follow all the advice about ask them about themselves and what have you the conversation just stops. They give me one word answers and it feels like I have to pull everything out of their nose. It's like absolutely nobody wants to talk to me.\n\nSo back to this girl. With her, the conversation flowed. It was really strange. I asked questions, then she gave elaborate answers, asked me questions, commented on what I said, and overall just led the conversation. She was so easy to talk to. \n\nAt first, I thought this meant there was some sort of connection between us, because we got along. But then today as I tried to talk to her further, she talked to like half the gym in the same animated fashion as she did with me.\n\nOf course I'm crushing on her, and of course she most likely wants nothing to do with me, but that's beside the point.\n\nIt was so weird seeing the contrast. This type of animated conversation must be normal for normies. They know what to say to keep other people interested, and other people also make an effort to converse with them because they seem like desirable people to be around. \n\nThink about your conversations with girls. Do they go like the one I had on Thursday, or the one I usually have? Chances are they're closer to the one I usually have. Part of this, of course, is that we're bad at talking to people for a variety of reasons (childhood trauma, etc...), but a conversation is a team effort, and if the other person (i.e. girl or normie) doesn't want anything to do with you, they won't put any effort into the conversation. They give one word answers, make excuses, and just try to disengage with you.\n\nMy roommate is a perfect example. He's a normie, maybe even a Chad. He gets invited to parties, has a bunch of friends, and calls them at 1 AM so I get to listen to his drama. I remember a couple of months ago, he was talking on the phone and essentially talking about how he met his current girlfriend. The story went something like this:\n\nHe and his friends went to a party, with a girl and their friends. After the party, he was told by one of his friends that one of the girls found him attractive. He said no to her, but said he liked another one. The friend said he would see what he could do, then, a couple days later, said she also found him attractive. They then started dating.\n\nLet's examine the factors at play here. First, he has an existing social network. For people like me, this does not exist because, to make friends, you need to talk to people. As I explained, I have a difficult time making conversation and most people don't really want to talk to me. So I don't really have friends to do this sort of thing. Second, I'm not attractive, so even if I had friends and this same scenario happened to me, it's likely that none of the girls would want anything to do with me, and would probably actively avoid me.\n\nThere's a second reason I bring up my roommate. When we first met at the beginning of the year, he and I talked a lot, similar to the way I talked to the girl at jiu-jitsu. He invited me to a party, had some girls over, and so on. The normie experience. Then, about a week or two into the semester, he decided that he didn't want to associate with me, and started giving me one word answers whenever I tried to talk to him. Whatever relationship we had dissolved and now we barely talk to each other.\n\nSo I guess my point is that there is a certain attribute or set of attributes that makes us FAs offputting to interact with. I thought it was just bad conversation skills (which obviously plays a role), but, as this girl proved, it's a lot more than that, as most people actively avoid putting effort into the conversation.\n\nSorry for the brain dump.", "subreddit": "ForeverAlone"}

She did some sort of depression/grief screening, gave me a checklist and asked if I had any friends I'd trust to confide in and no, dogs and family don't count. and having to tell her I didn't.\n\nand here I am, it's three years later, I still don't. \n\nAnyways, what I wanted to say is after finding a quote by Marcus Aurelius on getting out of bed- something like \"Ask yourself, Is this what I was made for? To stay warm and under the covers?\" I started reading, very sporadically, \"The Meditations\". I mean, it's free: [http://classics.mit.edu/Antoninus/meditations.html](http://classics.mit.edu/Antoninus/meditations.html)\n\nAnd oddly enough, ancient words from a dead guy still ring true. I'm trying to make a habit to care less about what others think, to gossip less, and to speak no ill of others. It does not work well when everyone seems to do so, when it is force of habit, and honestly it seems my college collects the assholes (90% acceptance rate is what I blame) and I meet some 'dumb customers' due to my officer roles in a club, but this line is what I need to remind myself:  \"Do not waste the remainder of thy life in thoughts about others, when thou dost not refer thy thoughts to some object of common utility.\" - Marcus Aurelius, Meditations Book Three. I'm also trying to remember more often that just like I really sound stupid when mispronouncing a word or during a migraine or when my cone dystrophy causes problems- God, I love having so much wrong with my body, I wish I had a missing leg or something easy to explain- it's possible I am meeting someone else during a bad moment for them.\n\nFrom what I can understand from the paragraph that line's from, Marcus realizes humans are social creatures and it is inevitable to think about others, what they think of you, how they see you, whose dating who, who cheated on who, etc- but it is best not to dwell on it, except when it is of a base utility. Do not waste time over whose dating who unless knowing that will help you navigate social situations you cannot avoid, loosely or strictly, basically; and that thinking about others too often will lead to negativity.\n\nThanks for reading if anyone did, I have a classes from 9am-12 tomorrow and it's 1:10am... I'm sorry if I don't respond to any comments quickly. I'd love to hear other peoples thoughts on Meditations.", "subreddit": "lonely"}

One of the worst messages I ever got was a girl asked how many partners I had, I told her none and that I was a virgin and she was immediately grossed out. Which made me feel like garbage so now I can never tell people what I am for the fear it's a real turn off. But I cant blame them, no girl wants to be with a dude that's not confident and that doesn't have any sexual experience. I only blame myself for these failures and the deep depression I've gotten myself into and the fact the people have all told me \"sex isnt everything in life\".

Back then, I was normal enough - I had friends, I enjoyed school and did well enough there. I enjoyed playing in a marching band. In fact, I was one of those girls where if adults were talking about me, they would nod sagely and say \"Beans? Oh, she'll do well in life\". I was funny, I was friendly, I was personable, I was quite intelligent - on paper I should have been a shoo-in for a good life. I'd do well in my exams, right? I'd eventually lose that puppy fat and blossom into a beautiful woman, wouldn't I? I'd go to a good university and go on to have a great career, no doubt about it!.... \n\nWelllll, no. My schooldays were, without a doubt, when I peaked. And that hurts to type. It is incredibly depressing to see where I ended up. Think of that episode of Family Guy where Stewie travels into the future and meets Future Stewie and [spoiler alert] finds out that he's basically a loser. That is me. That part of the episode really resonated with me (even though it's still funny). \n\n-I thought I'd have a great career. I don't have a career. I have a boring admin job that I hate, but I need, because bills. \n-I really thought that I'd be happily married, possibly with kids. I just took this for granted, as that's what happened for everybody, right??? Not for me. Never even managed to have a boyfriend. (virgin until age 28, lost it on a drunken ONS, who then told me to get out as his girlfriend would be home soon. Yeah.)\n-I thought I'd have a great life, with lots of friends (who were all friends with each other too) and social activities peppering my life. I now have only one friend, whom I rarely see. I haven't gone out socially in several years, like AT ALL. \n-The puppy fat never went away, in fact I put on more weight as I headed into my 40's. Always conscious of it since my teens, I dressed to cover, never to flatter. No willpower or motivation to lose weight. \n\n\nI went from someone who could talk to anybody and be entertaining, to struggling to maintain a conversation and trying not to contribute anything that could lead people to ask personal questions. I've gone from the life and soul, to socially awkward and saying dumb things because I'm not getting to practice my social skills. I hear my work colleagues, who are all of a similar age and also have kids of similar ages, chatting in their office next door amid peals of laughter while doing their work, and I wonder what the heck they could be talking about, because what do people even talk about????. I used to like to be able to join a conversation and throw in some funny comments. Now I avoid doing so because I don't want to be the centre of attention. I've mentioned it before, but I just don't 'fit in' with other women around my age, and that is really painful for me personally. I don't have anything in common with women my age. I'm not married, I don't have a partner, I never (ever) talk about my love/dating life, I don't have kids, or a career, or interesting hobbies, or a vacation planned, or....anything that ordinary people like to talk about. I know some people find that sort of chat tiresome, but imagine genuinely not even being able to join in, even if you DID want to,  because you haven't experienced any of it. \nI live alone, I eat alone, I sleep alone, I trudge through the weekends alone, I even struggle to converse with my parents on the phone because I have literally nothing to tell them. Nothing happens in my life, what could I possibly have to say? \n\nThis life is nothing like the brochure promised. I'm chronically lonely and disappointed in myself. I don't know where to go from here. I forsee a very long, lonely old age stretching out in front of me. ", "subreddit": "ForeverAlone"}

I tie the other side of the noose to a pull-up bar which is in the hall. Yet i couldnt do it. Normaly i took away the noose from pull up bar after failing.

{"post_id": "axsyrk", "created_utc": 1551835570, "title": "Hard Rejection from my crush (long post)", "author": "randman78", "self_text": "I've been very reluctant to write about this, but I think I should for the sheer fact as to let this be a warning to all FA's who crush on someone, and how to avoid not allowing yourself to fall for someone, and thinking you might have a chance with them.\n\nI've been posting off and on for the last several months about a woman I work with, who I fell incredibly hard for.  I started working with her back in November of 2016, and it wasn't until around May of 2018 that she started talking to me.  This girl is incredibly shy, suffers high social anxiety, and needs to take a lot of time to get comfortable with people.  It was not only me she didn't speak to for the first year and a half that I had known her, she really only spoke with two or three other people, one of which was a gay man (who we'll call Toby) who she is very close with, and the other was also a guy, but who is physically disabled (who we'll call Tim).  Tim ended up leaving the company in early May of last year, but still kept in touch with her.  He admitted he had a crush on her, but said she would never take a chance on him, because he was disabled.  He also told me that she was in love with Toby, the gay guy at work.  I myself questioned this, because she always seemed to spend a lot of time around him.  I also wasn't the only person who thought this, as it was pretty apparent how she acted around him.\n\nAfter Tim left, and our company moved our offices, this girl started talking to me, like a lot.  I found out we shared a lot of the same interests, career goals, taste in music, and just overall felt like we had a connection.  In fact, in the first couple of times she came over to my desk, sat down and started talking, I felt incredibly nervous with her, and there was this tension that I though she was also feeling.  And the eye contact between us was also very, very strong.  This girl even admitted because of her anxiety and shyness, she has a hard time looking people in the eye.  Yet with me, that didn't seem to be the case.\n\nI had always thought she was pretty, and was physically attracted to her.  But now that I was getting to know her as a person, I started to fall for her.  I was going to ask her out after about a month of us conversing, when she revealed to me that our boss asked her out about a year ago, and she doesn't shit where she eats.  On a side note, our boss asks out just about all the female employees, simply because he has no other life outside of work.  After she told me that, I restrained myself, and decided I would respect her boundaries, and not ask her our while we still work together.\n\nWe spent the rest of 2018 getting really close, or at least I thought so.  She even had a few emotional meltdowns about problems at work, and came crying to me for support.  We went out one night for a drink after work, and she once again brought up the fact that our boss asked her out, but would't date him, especially since he's the boss, and most definitely wouldn't go out with someone who's management.  However she looks at me and says, \"it might be different if it was someone on the same level\", which her and I both are in different positions, but at the same job level.  I took this as a possible positive sign that she might be hinting at something.  She did something similar to this again in November, when she was moving out from her parents for the first time in her life, and was a little afraid of living on her own.  She talked about what if someone broke into her place, and in a very flirtatious way about it says that if someone breaks in, she'll just have to call me to come help her.  Now don't get me wrong, I'm not great at reading women, but the way she said it, and the way she looked at me when she said it, was obvious flirting.\n\nThroughout the time we spent talking, the gay guy Toby's name came up a lot with her.  She said her and him were close because he also suffers high anxiety, and they were able to relate to one another, and had become friends outside of work.  However in the last year, he'd grown distant.  I eventually found out from talking with Tim, that she had a meltdown one day when this new girl (who we'll call Erica) because she was spending more time with Toby, and my crush was feeling like Erica was stealing Toby from her.  My crush never admitted this, and just alluded to the fact that Erica had been a bad influence on Toby, and the entire office overall.  Tim also informed me that Toby had told her on several occasions that he was not her boyfriend, and she was not his girlfriend, that he was gay, in a LTR with his boyfriend, and would never be anything with her other than just a friend and colleague.  This was around the time that he apparently started pulling back from her, because he could see she was far too infatuated with him.\n\nEven though I had became aware of all of this drama, I still liked this girl, and wanted to try and maintain a friendship with her.  I bought her coffees, and drove her home from work, a lot, and she continued to come and spend time with me, me never going to her I might add.  A couple of the other ladies at work started to notice, and even though she's very aloof and incredibly hard to read, all seemed to think that yes, she liked me.\n\nCome Christmas, I give her a Christmas card and a $50 gift card for the local coffee shop.  In the card I write:\n\n*\"Congratulations again on your new apartment, which I'm sure will be an exciting new chapter in your life.  I want to thank you for the trust you've bestowed upon me throughout this past year, as I've come to recognize that for you, requires a lot of faith and certainty for you to take that leap.  I'm truly appreciative that you've given me the opportunity for letting me get to know you better, and that you've been able to get to know me just as well.  I sincerely wish you all the best and happiness in the new year.\"*\n\nAfter I gave her that, she pretty much avoided me for a couple of weeks.  Given her shyness and anxiety, I chalked it up as I pushed too hard, and needed to give her some space, which I did.  Again, some of the other ladies at work said the same thing, that she probably needs time to process, as this is most likely a lot for her to take in.  She eventually came back, and things start to resume as normal, or at least they did for a little bit.  Instead, discussions of her and Toby became an almost constant.  I finally told her that everyone thinks she has a thing for him, and it isn't ever going to happen.  She denied it, at first.  But after a few weeks, she admitted she would probably sleep with him.  She also said in that same conversation that she doesn't date, hasn't dated since she was in her late teens/early 20's, and has no interest in dating or getting into a relationship.  I then pressed to ask her where we stand as far as friendship is concerned, and she said she still needs more time with me, \"baby steps\", as she put it.  It was at that point I was pretty much done with her.  Not only did I feel I was wasting all my time and energy with her, if she can't even decide if we're friends or not, but other things started to factor in, like how she never once offered to buy me a cup of a coffee, especially for all the coffees I bought her, or rides I had given her.  Generosity means a lot to me.  Or she never once said anything nice about me, or complimented me.  She's always big on people with a good work ethic, so when I asked her what she thought of mine, she said, \"you show up.\"  I was pretty disappointed in her, and had decided to write her off at this point.  Then, something happened.\n\nShe hadn't been feeling well over the last couple of weeks, and had been going to the doctors for tests.  She was diagnosed with stage 3 breast cancer.  My anger and disappointment with kinda fizzled out, as I became incredibly upset upon hearing the news, and even had a long hard cry about it.  I deeply cared for this woman, no matter what had happened or didn't happened between us, and I was devastated by this.  She was going to be taking six months leave from work for chemo and a mastectomy, with the possibility that she wasn't going to come back.  Those of us who were close to her, all told her not to come back, as she hates her job and our boss, and that this would be a fresh start in her life.  She insists she's going to come back though, many of which believe is because of Toby, and only Toby.\n\nOn the last day I saw her, even though I knew there as a 99.9% chance she was going to say no, I decided to ask her out, and tell her how I felt about her.  I got the following response:\n\n*\"No, no, no, absolutely not.  No!  Just stop, please just stop.  I'm sorry, but no.  I don't date, I would never date you.\"*\n\nShe also included the fact that she only thinks of me as Tim's replacement.  When she said that, she laughed.  Rejection is one thing, and something I was prepared for.  But to say I was nothing more than just a replacement, that hurt.  Clearly I'd been used as just as an emotional tampon, and that I was expendable in her eyes, not even as a friend.  When I told her I had been trying so hard with her to prove myself to her, she said she never saw the signs.  Even when I told her things like how much I adored her, and thought the world of her, she said it never clicked.  I personally think she's lying.  It was then that I decided to cut her off completely.  I told her that I had deeper feelings for her, and I couldn't remain in contact, as it wouldn't be honest.  She was a little taken back by that at first, but said okay.  I could have been just friends with her, but why bother when she clearly isn't friends with me, nor does she want to be.\n\nShe told a couple of people at work I asked her out, and to my surprise, they told me they told her, \"Why not go out with him, he's a good guy, give him a chance.\"  While I appreciate the sentiment, I would not go out with her now, knowing who she truly is.  One woman at work even told me, even with her having cancer, it gave her no right to treat me the way she did.\n\nSo all in all, that's been the last nine months of my life.  Pining over a woman who I thought was very different than who she turned out to be.  I thought her anxiety, introverted personality and shyness was one of the reasons she remained aloof with me at times, as did others, but I was wrong.\n\nAs an FA, it's incredibly difficult for us to take rejection.  I think it's one of the reasons so many of us are FA to begin with, because of the fear factor of getting hurt.  But to be used on top of it, especially in the way I was, blackens the soul even more.  Not only should I have known better from the start, I should have also realized that as an FA, I never would have stood a chance with her, even if she was a kinder person.  I hope I've learned my lesson by now, and to even fathom the idea of someone genuinely having interest in me is a fantasy.\n\nTL;DR: Fell in love with the shy girl at work, who's in love with the gay guy at work, pretended to be my friend, and brutally rejected me when I admitted my feelings for her.  I couldn't even get friend zoned.\n\nEDIT: Ages (me/40 - her/34) - Just in case people are wondering.", "subreddit": "ForeverAlone"}

{"post_id": "axvogn", "created_utc": 1551853470, "title": "What are your relationships like with your preferred sex?", "author": "Fixed_Assets", "self_text": "When I was in high school, I was terribly afraid of girls.  I was really attracted to them all the time, but I had already been told I was ugly throughout elementary and high school and was afraid I would offend anyone by trying to ask them out so I kept silent.  I tried developing social skills at the end of my high school days, but for the most part, I tried being the nice guy because I thought that is how guys got women to like them. Instead I ended up being 'one of the girls' more often than not - a rather humiliating experience that I would rather forget.\n\nEventually, once I gained more confidence in myself, I started approaching women and asking them out in college, but then I noticed that none of my advances were appealing.  I'd try talking to girls at a coffee shop and a bookstore and I'd see things going well enough.  But when I would see them sneaking around the back to leave so they wouldn't have to encounter me again on the way out or girls I knew from school covering their faces when walking by me so I wouldn't recognize them, I realized that even though I was not doing anything untoward or creepy to them intentionally, that approaching women was clearly not going very well for me.\n\nAfter a while, and right before I joined the workforce, I decided that from that point forward, I would just treat women the same way I treat men, and I noticed that my relationships improved with them.  I didn't talk to women unless I had a good reason to and even then, I kept conversation short and strictly business.  If it turned out a girl was friendly working with me, I'd engage her in more personal conversation, but always keeping things safe - I'd never ask a girl out, not even for lunch unless I was confident it would look totally non-threatening for her.  And I'd avoid women I was attracted to at all times - I've always had this feeling they could sense my attraction and would get creeped out.\n\nEvery time I would consider that maybe a girl was being nice to me because she was attracted, I would always remind myself of how people saw me when I was younger, as the weird ugly guy, and would simply assume the signs of interest were really all in my head.  Pretty much every time, I was proven right because she had a boyfriend, or was just not interested.  I've always gotten along really well with women who are married and/or older since I think they see a guy like me talking to them and don't automatically assume I have an agenda.\n\nI don't have many friends right now, just three, but two are women (one married, the other in a long term relationship).  I also am on good terms with the women in my department (and there are a lot!) at work - they all find me very nice and non-threatening, which is definitely the impression I am going for. There was one girl I wasn't interested in, but was young and single and I could definitely tell she wasn't comfortable around me, even though we barely interacted.  I just steered clear of her and things were ok.\n\nI've never hated women for rejecting me.  I know that being a perpetually underweight, non-masculine aspie is not exactly on the top of any woman's list of guys she'd want to be with, and to me, it's a pretty reasonable standard to have.  Sometimes shitty things happen to people and it's nobody's fault.  And I spent long enough trying to figure women out to see what I was doing wrong and how to fix it to realize that there is no secret code to figure out - I'm just not desirable and it's better for me to just accept it and make the best out of a raw deal, so I have.  And I do cherish the women I do have in my life - I do the best I can to help the young women in my department who aren't threatened by me to get ahead because I know how hard it can be, especially in the valley, for women to be taken seriously.  And the girl I know in a long term relationship is with a guy I set her up with, so I am always rooting for the women in my life to find happiness.\n\nWhat about you?  Do you interact with your preferred (same or opposite) sex in your life?  If so, what are those interactions like?  And what do you wish you could do to change them?", "subreddit": "ForeverAlone"}

I used to be quite the extrovert and in my elementary school and middle school years I had tons of friends. Or at least that's what I thought of them as. I was that guy who everybody knew but I didn't have a ton of super close friends. I had about 7 really good friends at the end of sixth grade which was fine by me. By the end of middle school I was down to two of the originals and one new close friend. And that brings us up to the present. By people moving and just growing away I now don't really have any friends. I'm that guy that everybody thinks highly of and everyone thinks of as a great dude, but is forgotten instantly. Don't try to assume it's because I'm selfish because I like to think I'm not and based off the rest of the high schoolers I know when it comes to kindness, I've won. In ninth grade I immediately lost everyone, I tried to communicate and I'd be dismissed or left on read. I locked myself in my room and either emptied my feelings into video games, Netflix, or my notes which I have amassed quite a bit of. It was the first birthday I'd spent alone and I spent it with frozen pizza and Netflix, basically a normal day besides the pizza as an award. I play two sports and would always be the person without a partner. It was no different during school. I remember once I was the first to class and I sat down at a six person table and all five other chairs were taken away and put up to other tables so people could sit with their friends. Once in gym we had a free day and nobody would let me join their game of basketball, I just got shrugged off even by my teammates. I soon gave up and spiraled down. I'd go days without talking and didn't mind it. All I needed was my mind and people were too much work anyways. I soon became more and more of a background character until people didn't even notice I was there anymore. I miss people. That's the main thing I'm writing this for and I don't even know why I'm writing it. People always seemed to let me down but I've become so socially awkward I don't even know how to talk to people anymore. I feel like I'm screaming into the void sometimes. I just want a hug really.

I have grown to become a fairly well-rounded young man despite a less-than-optimal upbringing to be gentle.  I\u2019ve conquered addictions and come face to face with and accepted many of my demons.  But my undying desire to be married still burns inside.  Loneliness has been my constant companion.  I\u2019ve never been in a relationship before although i have seen enough of the good and the bad to know what it takes and what to avoid.  I am both blessed and cursed with the self-awareness to realize that i\u2019m just not quite ready to handle the responsibilities of being a husband.  And i am working toward being ready.  Waiting has felt like an eternity though.  And especially more recently.  I met someone within the last year or so.  She\u2019s a couple years younger than me but she\u2019s such a mature and driven and resilient woman who i admire very much.  It didn\u2019t take me long to develop feelings for her.  And recently it became apparent to me that they may be mutual although she hadn\u2019t said it outright.  I knew that we were on a collision course.  Not being ready but also not wanting to lose her i decided to talk openly with her about things.  And it went very well.  We came to agreement that there are some goals that the two of us still want to achieve for ourselves individually, that we were willing to revisit things at a later time, and that we could definitely manage to stay friends in the meantime as long as we set some boundaries so that our feelings didn\u2019t grow out of control.  And yet, here i sit, alone in my bed in the dark, thinking about her.  I\u2019m determined to follow through with my goals and i know i can, but that doesn\u2019t take away the loneliness.  When my mind wanders, it wanders to her.  I imagine what feels like infinite unrealized futures.  I know i shouldn\u2019t as it just adds fuel to a fire that, for all i know, may be destined to never come to fruition.  But my hopeless romanticism is just part of who i am.  When i hear love songs i think of her.  When i\u2019m around her, i feel like i\u2019m floating in a sea of warmth.  I can look into her eyes and see the best parts of me.  And at the same time every word i say to her is not what i want.  When she asks me how i\u2019m doing or how i\u2019ve been i say i\u2019ve been pretty good.  But what i want to say is \u201cI\u2019ve been lonely.  I cried myself to sleep twice last week.  I miss you and i want to give this a shot more than anything else.  I\u2019m so lonely without you it brings me pain sometimes\u201d.  I hope and pray that when all is said and done that i will have a chance to give it a shot with her.  I hope for the best, but don\u2019t discount the worst.  I know this post is quite long-winded but neither of my two best friends were available to talk tonight and i just laid in bed in the dark thinking about her and how much i wanted to text her and tell her this but i knew it wouldn\u2019t help the situation so this is just where i ended up.  I don\u2019t expect all to understand my situation completely as there are certain details i just can\u2019t explain, but i just needed somewhere to put all of this emotion.", "subreddit": "lonely"}

You can be alone and be quite happy, but loneliness is often caused by our lack of self worth and need of validation through other people. The funny thing about conquering loneliness is that it requires solitude for us to discover who we are and to create who we want ourselves to be. \n\nI\u2019ve been lonely for a long time. I had a girlfriend and that stopped for a while, but then I felt the hole in my chest again.

Every time I've asked a girl out, the answer is always no. The one time someone did say yes, she backed out almost immediately after. My friends always tell me that there's always other fish in the sea and that I'll find someone some day, they mean well but I'm just so tired of hearing those words.\n\nRecently I suddenly had a crush on this girl I barely knew, like it came to me by surprise. She was visiting a different country (a country I used to live in) so I sent her a casual text suggesting some places to go to. As soon as I hit the send button though, I just suddenly realized how much I liked her. She is not only beautiful but smart as well and this just made me like her more. It was sort of getting pretty bad though since I was starting to write a song about her but I stopped myself when I realized what I was doing. \n\nI told some of my close friends about this and they agreed to help me out. I just found out today that she's already taken. I just feel so down, I really thought that she was 'the one'. I didn't know where else I could express my feelings and that's why I'm posting here. I just really hate myself for actually thinking that it would work out this time. I hate myself for still liking her even after hearing this. I don't know what to do, I don't know if I should just give up on love (I know it's a bit cringy) but at the same time I fear that if I do I might miss a really good opportunity so I don't have a clue as to what I should do.

I certainly never been in a relationship, but I do have a few friends. I would say I am a bit shy but I\u2019m still able to hold conversations with both guys and girls. Despite this, I feel this community is the only one that understands my feelings.\n\nNow to the story. In my first year of college I met this girl. I\u2019ll call her Val. Val wasn\u2019t necessarily the most attractive girl, but she did have her charm. A quite and studious girl with a great smile. We started off as friends. We studied together and even talked about our goals and whatnot. Eventually I started to grow fond of her, which was probably my biggest regret. After winter break she told me she did miss me. This was very shocking to me since no girl has ever be so forward with me. Especially one who was as quiet as she was. You could see how my feelings began to really affect my study. To this day is still believe having her on my mind all day was the reason I did so poorly in college.\n\nAfter summer break things changed. She met a guy. We\u2019ll call him Jay. Before she use to spend time with me, but now this guy was taking all her time. I didn\u2019t know him. I only heard the stories. When I finally met him I no longer felt jealous or threatened. Jay wasn\u2019t necessarily a \u201cChad\u201d. In fact, I would say to any normal woman he would be upsetting. Not because of how he looks. He seemed normal enough. No, this was most certainly his attitude. \n\nJay was a very stupid guy. He was so close to failing out of college. In fact Jay and Val met in a math class. A class he had to take and pass to stay in school. He was also very rude. He had no manners and was very vulgar in his speech. For some reason this made Val laugh. \n\nSince he met her, the time I spent with Val decreased and decreased. This left me bitter. The girl who told me she missed me now suddenly wants nothing to do with me. I tired to call to hang out. Tried to set up more study sessions. Nothing worked. The times they did I could tell it didn\u2019t feel the same. I would get glimpses of the good times here and there but it was never enough to say I felt alive.\n\nEventually, I couldn\u2019t stand it. I didn\u2019t like the girl  Val was turning into because of Jay. I decided to lay it all out in the open. \n\nThe girl who was my best friend, the girl who told me she missed me was still in there somewhere. I confessed my feelings hoping to revive what was in hindsight a lost cause. Of course she said no. If that wasn\u2019t hard enough, she told me she had feelings for Jay. \n\nI tried to kill myself that night. I couldn\u2019t even do that right which is why I\u2019m able to write this. \n\nEventually time went by. They became a couple. She made him a better person. Not because he changed inside, but because he was happy now. He had a reason to keep going. \n\nFrom failing and giving up to success and happiness. All because he met her. He was still the same vulgar idiot, but a happy one. This happened 4 years ago. They are still together. They graduated together. She maintains him. Like I said he didn\u2019t change. He\u2019s currently unemployed, but that doesn\u2019t seem to be a deal breaker like most say. Despite this they are happy. \n\nAnyways, the reason I wrote this was because I\u2019m shocked it still affects me now as if it only happened yesterday. I don\u2019t feel anything for her now. But still I wonder, if destiny was on my side, would I have changed like Jay did? I don\u2019t think of her as often now. Yet, I can\u2019t help but think that I could have made her happier. \n\nRelationship can change someone, and contrary to popular belief, you don\u2019t have to love yourself first. Jay sure didn\u2019t. This might only be an exception though. Maybe I was unfortunate enough live this exception. I\u2019m happy for him in a way. Maybe if things worked out than he would be writing this instead of me. \n\nSorry for the long rant. I\u2019m sure I detracted from my point but I\u2019m sure you can understand the need to vent. I might delete this post later, but feel free to vent. I guess I need to know I\u2019m not the only one.\n\n", "subreddit": "ForeverAlone"}

{"post_id": "ay9j21", "created_utc": 1551940102, "title": "Cousin Died to Drugs", "author": "Imthatguy0029", "self_text": "My favorite cousin died tonight to drugs. Lately, I've been hearing about some of you willing to turn to drugs in your times of need. I'm telling you all this story in hopes I can save some of you that may be in the same situation.\n\nA few months ago I was introducing him to Eve: Online, and he was very excited to learn that I'd been playing the game too. While I was showing him the ropes, he openly told me he had been suffering from depression and was trying to keep himself in check. I don't recall how I reacted at the time. After a bit, he moved to an area with another cousin that didn't have internet, so I didn't hear from him at all.\n\nA week or two ago, my 4-6 year old niece found him unconscious, bleeding at the nose, foaming at the mouth with needles around him in my oldest brothers basement while he was visiting one day. Too young to understand clearly what was going on, she was scared to sleep in her own house that night and slept at my house. My oldest bro and his wife did what they could, and he was taken in an ambulance unconscious and using machines to breathe.\n\nThere he stayed for a week or two with his family unsure if he would live, be braindead, or miraculously be ok. Family members posted pics of him on Facebook asking everyone to pray. Apparently some of them knew he'd previously done drugs but didn't know he continued.\n\nThe drug was called the strongest drug out there by the doctor, also called a serial killer in the streets. I don't know it's exact name. My mother also told me that she heard it was originally created to sedate elephants. Pharmacists explained that contact with your skin alone could kill a person, which was problematic when it came to trying to clean it up properly to keep the niece and even younger nephew safe. They won't be allowed down there from now on, just in case.\n\nClearly, my cousin didn't know what he was getting into with this drug. I know this because I know he wouldn't have wanted to cause all this trouble, especially in front of such young relatives. He had no idea how deadly that drug was, or perhaps he had no idea what it even was. Idk.\n\nI didn't think I'd be too upset. I hung out a lot with him when I was younger and looked up to him then. Part of me feels like he's the most to blame, but I also understand that he was going through depression, and had previously been exposed to drugs probably causing him to become an addict together.\n\nTonight I was woken by one of my brothers and told the news. I didn't react much but with frustration, not in front of my family. I went out to walk in the cold  to grab me and my little bro mochas at a nearby gas station. I normally do that to find time alone to sing on my way there. It was the best I could do to mourn my cousin's passing. I couldn't manage to finish my songs tonight.\n\nTL;DR: cousin was depressed, used drugs for support and died accidentally taking something deadly unknowingly.\n\nI know it's tough out there guys. Please don't turn to hard drugs to get away from your problems. It may not always seem like it, but there are people who care for you. Once you get past a certain point, it's hard to get out of drugs and it makes your problems so much tougher to remove. Reach out to others and let your pain push you to do something more positive. If you're already into anything harder than weed, honestly, let someone responsible know or call a hotline. Many times you don't know when you're past the point where you need someone else's help to see the problem and stop. I promise there is at least one person out there who will or does care about you, one person who you make a difference in their life, no matter who it may be.

So I fell into a weird spiral of using alcohol to bring out my confidence. Those few years were the most social I\u2019ve ever been and to me it made sense. I was halfway through college and single and I knew this was the only way to get me out of my shell so I could meet people. And it worked, but obviously not in the best ways. It taught me nothing about actual socializing which is what I needed. A year and a breakup later, my friends started to dwindle. Sure I met more people when my husband came along, but there was always this emptiness that still lingered. I\u2019ve learned to define it as a missed connection. Someone I aspire to meet, but just haven\u2019t yet. That\u2019s how I keep myself hopeful.

I am a really shy and introverted person and I deal with social anxiety, I have been my whole life and only found out last year when I was 18.\n\nI have only a few friends which I'm thankful for but we aren't as close as we used to be, one goes to the same college as me but I do all online and he is in a different major, my other two are in high school still. All three of them are in healthy relationships with good people which is great, I'm happy for them, but it kind of sucks for me because I'm almost always playing 3rd, 5th, or 7th wheel which is usually fine with me but after a while it takes a toll and I've been somewhat depressed and not being in a relationship has been on my mind constantly for nearly a year now.\n\nAll 7 of us were planning on doing prom (last year) but not actually going to the dance, just a fancy dinner and hang out, I was excited about it until the day of when I expressed my anxiety about driving alone in the city (I'm always really anxious about finding new places I haven't been to before) and I just felt sort of weird being the only one in the group without a date and I would constantly think about how other people would think of me. After I said my piece, they just said that I don't have to go if I don't want to. I never told them but it kind of hurt when they said that, I don't think they meant to hurt me at all, it just kind of seemed like it.\n\nI have a therapist and shes really good and I see her every week and now every other week but I haven't really told her about being lonely, I told her about the prom thing but at that time I didn't really feel bad about not having a date. There's still a few things I don't tell her about and I'm still really hesitant to because I'm always embarrassed to and I don't know why I just am, I never tell my parents about my feelings and I don't even let them touch me, I don't like being touched that much, there's a few cases with my friends when they'd put their hand on my shoulder/ back but I generally hate it, I get really uncomfortable and tense and a lot of times ill flinch.\n\nBack to the main topic, I started using dating sites and I went into them not really knowing what I would do if I actually hit it off with someone, every time I'd get a match I'd have a rush of anxiety and the conversations would never last long except for 2 girls who I had a good conversations with and I could see myself with them but one randomly unmatched me andIi was pretty down about it for a little bit and the other said she didn't want to give me her number because she gets a ton of matches and doesnt give out her information, I understood and was respectful about it and she was thankful I did and then we didnt talk again. I began to look at other places for female interaction and I started looking into more adult websites (which I'm pretty embarrassed about) and I didn't really know that people get scammed a lot and I got messaged on an alternate email by people tying to catfish me and I gave into one who asked me to send $200 and then we could meet up. For a little context, i have never been in a relationship before and im still a virgin which im not too upset about, and I paid the one catfish (who might be real but uses a model's pictures but sent me some other pics that dont look like her the model 100% but look similar) and the day we agreed to meet, i got so nervous and anxious the whole day, it was constant butterflies in my stomach and i didnt eat the whole day because i lost my appetite, thats how i feel when i get close (or at least think im close) to having sex. I talked with a couple of other girls but I never met with any but I'm really close to one know and I told her about my anxiety and I'm still not sure if I should, she said we'd be able to get to know each other and she would pick me up after I send money to her \"manager\" and I'm considering not to because I'm not sure about it and I don't make a lot of money.\n\nI deleted most of the dating sites i was on becasue i dont like them, im still on a couple but i might delete them very soon. I dont know what i was thinking the whole time i was on those sites, I just felt like i was just desperate. I go to a community college and I'm doing really poorly right now and I'm doing all online and that definitely didn't help my loneliness, I'm planning on taking classes in school next semester as much as I hate school, hopefully, I can find someone then, as for now I'm still lonely and I won't get to go to in-class classes until the fall. I haven't told anyone about my deeper issues and I'm scared to because I always feel embarrassed to discuss them even if it might not be embarrassing.", "subreddit": "lonely"}

I'm 24f and just hope there's people here that might relate to what I'm going through. Again, I'm sorry if this isn't the right sub for this. I'm not here to upset anyone or break rules.\n\nOkay as I said, I'm 24f. I have severe depression and GAD. I've had phases where I've been diagnosed with acute severe anxiety. I'm on meds to help me feel somewhat normal but I still go through pretty bad depression episodes. I'm in the middle of one now.\n\nI'm in bed, it's nearly 3am and I'm in tears. It's my birthday in a few days and it just makes me realise how pathetic I am and my life is.\n\nI work part time but I had to call in sick today because I truly believed if I was put under any stress today I'd probably hurt myself.\n\nI've dealt with depression since I was a young girl, I couldn't make any friends until about 15 where I had a group of friends then over the years, most of them ended up being sick of me or hating me. I left my boyfriend at the time for a man that I had known for a month. I lost all my friends then but thought it was worth it.\n\nThat man abused me for 3 years. My depression had become so severe while with him I tried to take my life multiple times.\n\nI realise that I have zero idea of how to talk to people. I went to uni to escape my bf basically and I was in such a state. I remember I was drunk and exploded at a guy that was horrible to others and I had enough. The rest of my class concluded I was a psycho and wanted nothing to do with me. The class actually bonded over how much they hated me. I don't blame them one bit quite frankly. These aren't things I've assumed. I've outright been told all this.\n\nI was kicked out pretty quickly because I couldn't cope. Tried to kill myself again but survived, admitted to my mum I'm not coping and she came to get me the next day.\n\nI eventually left my bf which was a terrifying experience (mainly my anxiety tbf) and since I've tried to be better but it's been no good.\n\nI've tried dating here and there and it's been no good.\n\nQuite frankly, I'm unattractive. Men don't notice me. The only thing noticeable is my low self esteem. Every woman around me has had experience being cat called, men hitting on them, staring at them in public etc. I'm well aware they hate this and it isn't a positive experience for them but I am just broken. I'm not even noticed. I just don't exist to men. My experiences are men pointing me out and saying 'I wouldn't do anything with that!' or mocking me\n\nAny man that does give me attention either friendship or romantically is always a ploy for getting sex. They want sex and at the time I'll do. I've had guys I've been friends with for years, we've had sex and they ghost me like it's nothing.\n\nWhen I see women, I can tell they know they're better than me or that I'm nothing compared to them. They probably see me and feel better about themselves. Everytime I just feel ashamed of myself. Why did I go outside. I know I'm not the centre of everyone's lives and most of them don't think of me at all. I'm more saying that they will at least see me and just feel better about themselves.\n\nI'm probably going to be mentally ill the rest of my life. I'm on meds, in therapy and trying cbt but I don't see them actually curing me.\n\nI'm not pretty or interesting enough for guys to look over the mental illness. I see myself being in a relationship with someone with mental illness and wanting to bend over backwards to help them through their episodes but that's because I'd see them as worth it. I know how hard it is to go through an episode and I'd want to help them through it.\n\nI try to have interests, try to watch and read things so I have things to talk about but I just completely freeze up around people. I work in customer service but whenever I order food I feel like I'm about to have a meltdown because I haven't rehearsed my order enough.\n\nSo.. I'm likely never going to have a meaningful relationship. Friendship or romantic. Maybe I should consider myself lucky because maybe I'll meet a guy that'll pretend to like me then pump and dump me or meet a man that'll prey on my low self esteem and essentially own me\n\nI don't know if I'm here for advice...

Sure, everyone's been kicked when they're down sometimes-- but what happens when you've never been able to stand on your own two feet in the first place?\n\n\nThat's me. Every day I have to put on a \"happy\" face and pretend I **don't** hate my life after being absolutely destroyed so many years ago. This melodramatic rant, sadly, isn't too far from the truth. \n\n\nJust like 99% of y'all here, I was bullied. Bad. Nobody gave a shit back then, and they still don't. That's the **TL;DR** of the last decade of my life. I know y'all *also* don't like talking about relationships, but I was in a LDR for a third of my life. She never wanted to meet, which should've been a big red flag but back then I was too invested to even care. \n\n\n\nThe day she said \"I can see myself spending the rest of my life with you,\" I was on cloud nine. No more than a month later, she left me for a new guy at her school. Cole, if you're reading this -- fuck you. \n\n\n\n\nI could only imagine how worse other people have it. My story ain't too bad, thank God, but I am a weak man. Anything worse than **that** and I'm 100% certain I wouldn't be here writing this story tonight. \n\n\n\n\n\nSociety says \"no, don't kill yourself! That would make **ME** sad and would slightly inconvenience **MY** life! Don't be selfish! Let me bully you more!\" \n\n\n\n\nAt the end of the day, who's really right?\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd yes, the usual disclaimer : If you're experiencing suicidal thoughts, actions or any of the above, contact your local suicide prevention hotline, yadda yadda yadda... Some complete strangers will be more than happy to help you out. As if that's *ever* worked throughout our childhoods  \n\n\n\nI'm not saying \"off yourself,\" because that's **NOT** the point of this post. What I **AM** saying is, fuck, this life is hard. The fact that we have just one **more** thing on our plates (being alone for the remainder of our lives) just makes things worse, and I'm glad I got this community of people here to help me remember things aren't **horribly** bad as this plane I'm in crashes into the ground and eventually the first two layers of Hell. \n\n\n\n^^inb4 ^^possible ^^ban", "subreddit": "ForeverAlone"}

For shits and giggles, I decided to fly over to Reno, Nevada to one of those legal, regulated brothels.\n\nI was pleasantly surprised that they offered a free cab service right to their front door, which was nice. The girls were very kind and professional. I let the escort know that I was indeed a virgin and never seen a naked woman in person. I assume having sex with someone you care about is better; nevertheless the sex was simply amazing, far better than porn. I fulfilled practically porn fantasy I ever saw. I haven't gone back because I'm a cheapskate.\n\nI mainly decided to lose my virginity at age 21 to an escort because it was then in 2017 that I've come to accept my fate. I'm also a curious person, and I wanted to know what sex was like before I died. I also had disposable money. If you're one of those people curious about seeing an escort and wondering if it's worth it or not, I'd say do it.

I need to get this off my chest and hopefully someone will listen to me here.\n\nSo about a year ago I had some serious mental health issues come to a crisis point and spent around 4 months in hospital. Before this I was living in a share house with two guys (I'm a girl). We would hang out alot and I made friends with their friends too and we all hung out together often. I also had/ have a female best friend who used to hang with me all the time. When I went to hospital, however, not one of them messaged me or visited or called. It was pretty disheartening to say the least but I was in a pretty bad state and figured they were just giving me space. They were the first proper friend group I've ever had in my life and I felt like I was not an outsider for once.\n\nThis bit is kinda important: I never did anything to them or acted poorly around them, I just had a manic episode where I spent alot of money and didn't sleep basically. \n\nSince all of this, I haven't been able to rekindle the relationships and they never text. Even my \"best friend\" never texts me. I tried a couple times to hang out with someone... ANYONE, but have been knocked back. I've given up now and spend most of my time alone. \n\nIt has really effected my motivation to start new friendships, let alone dating. I look at events coming up to maybe go to and meet people but I honestly feel like there must be something wrong with me so don't bother. I have been to quite a few too where I try to make connections but, again, the people never want my company enough to initiate or text back. I'm in therapy which helps but the loneliness is really taking it's toll. I often just cry at random times. I haven't been touched by another human in almost 2 years so I take long baths to feel a bit better. But I need human connection. \n\nI don't get it.

We are a server for meeting new people and making friends, and despite our numbers, we are still a pretty small close-knit group that would love to expand our circle with more unique and interesting people. \n\n**What Do We Do?**\n\nWe are a mainly voice-active community, so we spend most of our time chatting together while we play games or go about our day. We run a popular weekly movie and game night, in addition to a monthly game tournament, art club, Minecraft server, and other special events. There\u2019s plenty of text and media channels to share your interests as well as a variety of voice channels for larger or smaller conversations, watching movies, or playing video games. \n\n**Our Philosophy?**\n\nWhile we aim to facilitate a fun and welcoming place for online strangers to meet and make friends, our core philosophy rests on the concept of free and open discussion. This means the staff takes a hands-off approach in regards to the opinions of the users and the language used. At the end of the day, The Glory Hole is all about hilarity and friendship, nevertheless, if you are easily offended, this probably isn\u2019t the place for you as we tend to have silly hazing processes for our new members.\n\n**Should You Join?**\n\nThe Glory Hole has provided us with genuine and long-lasting friendships, and we would love to provide this opportunity to others such as yourself. A group of people like this is an amazing way to make new friends or at the very least fill those lonely evenings up with lots of laughter and other voices. So if you're 16+ and at all interested in joining our group or poking your head in to see what\u2019s up, I welcome you to follow this link:\u00a0[https://discord.gg/H4w58Px](https://discord.gg/H4w58Px)", "subreddit": "lonely"}

With a bit of a story about me", "author": "LonelyWoodworker", "self_text": "*skip to last phrase for a short version* \n\nI am FA... There, I said it!  At least now I am completely honest with myself. Here is how I ended up here...\n\nI am a slightly above average looking 22 y/o guy living in Eastern Canada. I don't have any mental or physical issues. At the age of 16, I started my own summer woodworking business, and kept going at it until now it is successful enough that I have no issues taking on new work. I am not rich, but I have no debt and own all of my equipment. I took Business Admin. in college.\n\nThe \"issue\" here is that I was homeschooled - all the way through high school. I loved my education, and can honestly say that I recieved a quality upbringing. Unfortunately, being isolated from my peers set me up for the torture I've been experiencing ever since going to college at 18 years old - I had very few friends, no relationship experiences to draw from, and ABSOLUTELY no clue on how to go about meeting girls with a long term goal of starting my own family.\n\nI began by trying to approach some of the girls I'd meet through my daily life - those with whom I had something in common, be it a mutual friend, or maybe a business experience. It took me all of 3 weeks to fully exhaust my \"list\" of gals I knew - and I ad no success. \nI managed to go on one date with a girl same age as me that I've known for a few years (I knew she was single). The date started off great, lasted 5 hours (!!!) and we really hit it off really well (or so I thought). The next week after, she sent me a long text explaining how she was \"always busy\" and \"no time for relationship stuff\" even though she admitted to having had a great time with me... Needless to say that was it for that one.\n\nThat was 6 months ago....\n\nSince then, for the first time in my life I entered into a period of depression. I began to really feel like crap, because I understood that no relationship will happen with any of the girls in my circle - they all rejected me. \n\nI am now staring into a vicious cycle of day game cold aproach. Living in a rural area (farm) and with the closest city being 45k people population, my options for clubs, events, or group outings are mediorce to non-existent.\n\nBut, I am not giving up. I will keep trying. You guys are a great enouragement, but not only that - you are realistic about our realities as FA's. I am sick and tired of the BS I have to hear about everything \"eventually falling into place by itsself for me\". Ha ha! As if, and if only. Tales like that only waste my precious years when I could actually try to do something to improve m chances... Or maybe not. But at least not lie to myself with \"entitlement\" crap.\n\nAnyways, this is my first post. You'll likely see me around here on occasion from now on. Maybe one day I'll escape FA status. Regrettably, time is working against me on this. \n\n\nShort version: Tl;dr: new guy here, homeschooled with pretty much no friends, no past relationships to build upon, never been hugged by a girl other than my mom.

It was nice hearing from her but it caused me to look for a few people I talked to when I had friends mostly 10-15 years ago. \n\nMost were women and back then they were in their 20's getting into relationships then breaking up. All of them are now either married or in a long term relationships. They all have kids. They have attractive boyfriends or husbands. The few guys are also in long term relationships with average to above average looking girlfriends or wives. Most have kids. \n\nThey were mostly immature but relationships helped them go from being 20something year old people who mostly didn't have steady relationships to long term relationships with kids. They use their social circles to meet new people. Sometimes that is the person they end up having kids with. Their social circles also help them get jobs. \n\nIn my case I needed a social circle due to being socially awkward and their support would have probably caused me to find a job that paid an okay amount of money so I could get by. Since I'm socially awkward, my friends would have helped me find a woman who could get past my being socially awkward and maybe even would find me attractive. I'm ugly but maybe I would get lucky and they would know a woman who found guys like me attractive. There are women with different tastes out there. In her case it would have to be a very different taste. \n\nBeing FA has caused me to remain stuck in a part of life that most people get through with help from friends. They go in as young adults who haven't settled down yet and come out as 30 year olds with good jobs. They come out with husbands and wives or are in long term relationships. They come out as mothers and fathers. I'm stuck in that transition period. The difference is, I don't have the social circle to help me get through it like most people do. I don't have the companionship of significant others that other people do. I will never escape this.\n\nI'm never going to become an adult. Just a lonely, overgrown, lonely, socially awkward, young adult in my mid 30's.", "subreddit": "ForeverAlone"}

My brother is 5 years younger than me and was born with a few disorders involving his pancreas mild autism and slight to moderate retardation. By all means I should be the \"normal\" sibling, but I feel the opposite is true. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI remember when I was 7 years old my family which included myself my mother father and of course my brother moved from California all the way to Northeast Pennsylvania. Everything I knew was torn away from me and I was dropped into a new environment that was hostile to me at every turn. This particular area of Pennsylvania was heavily christian, white, and conservative. Now honestly there's nothing wrong with that, but that clashed with me being black, an atheist, and coming from a family that registered democrat. My mother enrolled me in the school that she thought had the best education to offer. Only problem was I was the only black student there.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI was constantly picked on for my color by the other children so I acted out  to gain their approval. Became the class clown, but that only attracted the scorn of the teachers. Teachers often would tell me how they didn't like me or how they felt sorry for my teacher because she had to put up with my presence, how I should go  to the school down the hill (where the majority of black students attended). To me the teachers were no better than my classmates so I never was able to see my teachers as nothing more than potential bullies. So I began to adopt their Caucasian mannerisms. I began to imitate the way the talked the way they behaved I tried to become as similar to them as possible, but of course that didn't help me assimilate.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy mother eventually withdrew from the school and enrolled me in a charter school in the next town over. Funnily enough when my brother came of age to attend elementary school she sent him to the same school that had treated me so horribly. I was sure it would end as badly if not worse due to his special needs, but I was wrong. My brother was extremely popular in his class. Everybody loved him from his classmates to teachers. I was shocked, while I was chased away he became the star. When it was announced that we would be moving to Florida my brother's class threw a pizza party and made a photo album of all their memories together. I received a gag Valentine's Day card.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIn Florida I thought I'd have more success with a fresh start. I thought now that I'd be around other black students it'd be easier, but once again I was dead wrong. After spending so long up North trying to fit in I ended up only alienating myself from my own kind. They mocked me for the  way I talked and the way I dressed. I was still alone after moving half way across the state. My brother quickly made new friends and found his place among his class.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhat finally made it apparent that my brother was the favorite was the Christmas of 2015. It was a rough year financially for the family so neither my brother or I received gifts from our parents that year. It didn't bother me that much, but my brother must've mentioned it at school. In early January I remember mom had us clean the house twice during the same weekend which struck me as odd, but it all made sense when a firetruck rolled into our driveway and Santa stepped out to greet my brother and apologize for missing us on Christmas. His whole class and to some extension the local community all came together to give my brother his best Christmas. They brought several gifts for him including clothing, money, a new bicycle. Even the local newspaper covered the event.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAll this just for him... but I didn't even have a guest at my tenth birthday party. \n\nSometimes I wonder, what does my brother even need me for? If I was gone he'd be fine. He'd have a community behind him to help him recover. I'm just not necessary.", "subreddit": "ForeverAlone"}

It's been 11 years and I am running out of reasons to keep fighting. \n\nI joined the Army at 18 with all sorts of dreams for what my future would look like..... and never in my wildest nightmares would I think I'd end up here. At 20 I left for war ... I left knowing there was a very real possibility I wouldn't make it back home alive... the irony of it now is that I wish I hadn't made it back. I thought the fighting would stop when I made it home but I was so fucking wrong. \n\nI tried to pretend I was okay but soon found myself spiraling down into severe alcoholism (I would drink a case of Coors Light and a bottle of whiskey every single day) .... On December 16 2009 I decided I couldn't wake up another day an attempted to hang myself in the closet of a hotel room - I ended up just ripping the rod out of the wall ... I decided that I would try again when I woke up since I was really drunk... my godfather is a priest and managed to track me down and convince me to check myself into the hospital ... so I did. That would be the beginning of countless hospitalizations, medications, and therapy ... \n\nOn March 16/17 2010 I tried to kill myself again -- this time I actually succeeded but was brought back. I had been living in my parents basement since I'd gotten out of the hospital .... I remember that night thinking that I had a good day and that I probably wouldn't have another anytime soon so I slammed a case of beer, bottle of champagne, bottle of NyQuil, a bunch of prescription pills including Klonopin, and multiple full syringes of cat insulin (it's close to human insulin ... and not being diabetic I figured it would certainly help kill me). Anyways my parents found me without a pulse and not breathing so they started CPR until the paramedics arrived. I ended up in ICU in a coma with an endotracheal tube down my throat since my lungs were only operating at 30%.  To the surprise of everyone I pulled through without any lasting damage ... I remember waking up in ICU and have never been so pissed in my life that I was still here. \n\nI've been through every VA program ... Countless civilian treatment programs ... experimental treatments ... holistic treatments ... multiple psychologists and psychiatrists ... anytime I would get a suggestion from someone on how to handle PTSD, depression, or anxiety I would do it ... desperate to find anything to make this life at the very least tolerable........ but nothing has worked long term - anything I found to find me relief only helped me short term if that. \n\nI buried most of my friends who were fighting the same battles I am ... next week is the anniversary of my squad/team leader from Iraq killing himself.... the following week will be the anniversary of another friend suffering a fatal heart attack in his 40's - he was dead in his apartment for almost a month before he was found - I think about that part constantly .. how alone he was. Next month my best friend/soulmate would be turning 30 but he's gone as well ... his loss was the most devastating - I don't think I'll ever get over losing him. I've got other friends who didn't make it back from the wars and then those who did but overdosed self medicating.\n\nI feel like I'm the last one left behind.  I have stopped making friends out of the fear of losing them ... I've stopped dating because I don't want to drag anyone else into this darkness with me. I go days without having a conversation with anyone other than my mom or stepdad. I have passing thoughts of suicide multiple times a day but I force myself to keep moving forward. I keep telling myself \"the only way out is through\" ..... but it's a lot harder to do than to say.  I'm beyond broke. I sleep on a broken 15 year old Walmart futon held together by duct tape and plywood. My bank account is overdrawn and I still have 3 weeks to get through ... I'm suppose to go visit my mom today but it's a 4 hour drive and I'm fairly sure I won't have enough gas to get up there. I'm tired of being broke, alone, and depressed. \n\nI guess I'll leave it at that. If you are religious or spiritual at all I'd appreciate any prayers or good thoughts sent my way.

I may be unattractive too, though I'm very confused about that.\n\nThere is a guy where I work who has a reputation for asking the new girls out. He isn't particularly attractive and has never been successful, but continues to try nonetheless. I don't think he knows that everyone knows he does this. It is my greatest fear to be perceived like him. To misread the signals so badly that I think it's appropriate to ask them out after only a couple of conversations. To have everyone laughing at me behind my back at my attempts to start a relationship. To be perceived as unattractive and batting out of my league. It's not so much that I fear rejection, although I definitely do, it's more that I fear the gossip that rejection will generate. You could probably trace this fear back to an event in my late childhood where I was shot down by a girl and laughed at by all her friends. You might say that children are cruel and that in the grown up world it isn't like that, but I would point to this guy from work as an example. As adults, they may not laugh in your face any more but they still love to gossip. Even if they felt sympathetic and wanted me to succeed, the fact that they all know about my failure would be humiliating.\n\n**I'm a virgin**\n\nIf I pass the first obstacle and somehow attract a partner, as soon as they find out that they are my first relationship, kiss or sexual encounter they will run for the hills. What kind of freak makes it this far in life without ever experiencing any of those things? Is there something wrong with me that they haven't been able to spot but that everyone else has? My parents (and probably friends too) think I'm a closeted homosexual just because they've never heard me talk about girls or seen me with any.\n\nIf I manage to start my first relationship, I won't have a gauge, a compass, because I have no previous experience. I imagine most normal people have a few relationships under their belt and can tell, *this feels different, THIS is what love is*, or, *this relationship feels healthier*. I am afraid that I will be so happy that someone actually finds me attractive that I settle for a toxic person and am unable to see that. Or that I won't actually be in love with them, just think that I am because I've never felt what real love is like.\n\n**I'm boring**\n\nEvery girl I've ever had a crush on has been totally different from me. They have lots of friends, enjoy drinking, like popular music and regularly go clubbing. I have always felt boring because I don't enjoy those things. I feel intense pressure to like those things, to be extroverted. I don't want to be the boring weirdo who likes games, movies, books and staying at home. I don't want to be the loud, cocky guy who loves to party all the time either, but it seems that that is what most people want.\n\n**I'm trying to change**\n\nI've allowed anxiety, social anxiety, to control my life. I've always despised myself and am taking steps to try and change that. I've seen a therapist and am trying to turn my life around but I feel so far behind. Like everyone knows the rules already and I'm trying to join mid-game. My lack of experience makes me feel intensely unattractive and unconfident to the point that I don't even want to try dating out of fear of my fears being real.", "subreddit": "ForeverAlone"}

{"post_id": "azvjvj", "created_utc": 1552322357, "title": "Making someone 'feel special' is impossible when you're unattractive", "author": "Drenzard", "self_text": "Whenever someone is saying that you shouldn't be going around and hitting on too many girls, whether it be hookups in parties, bars or nightclubs ( Which literally every young person does, can't count the number of threads on /r/sex or TwoX about walking up to some 'cute'/'hot' guy and sleeping with him at the end of the night, due to appearance ) or trying to go on dates, they're usually doing so from a position of privilege. \n\nTelling that if you are perceived as treating your options as 'interchangeable' or acting out of desperation just because someone has a vagina or whatever, then it will be off-putting or 'creepy' or something else and they wouldn't want to be with you because you should have 'eyes only for them' ( Not that most young people follow that rule ) and make them feel special. \n\nWhat that fails to take into account however is that attractive men, and women for that matter, can afford to reserve their advances for someone who 'catches their eye' because *very quickly* that interest is going to be reciprocated and that's it, they're done, they don't have to search anymore. It's easy to be selective when you have a high likelihood of success. \n\nWhile for unattractive guys, all it does is effectively eliminate whatever possibly slim chances existed to begin with that you would find that 1 person in a million who might be willing to go along with you. You're just going to end up without any sort of romantic or sexual experiences just as if you were to do nothing at all, and it's not like you have much time. Most people already expect a certain level of 'experience' in your 20's and by 30 everybody is already marrying. \n\nBecause like it or not, the most fundamental part of these interactions is for the person who's 'special' to you to consider you as a prospective sexual and romantic partner and 'feel the spark' ( Or whatever they like to call it ) rather than just seeing you as someone to joke with or hang out with or do a mutual activity with, and like it or not, that consideration is often made within minutes of meeting you thanks to obvious factors. And that part comes before all other forms of compatibility.\n\nSo it doesn't matter how much you really think that one girl in the club or party seems chill or great and you genuinely like her vibe, because in the first moments of talking to her you can see if she doesn't like yours. The same doubly goes for dating someone you know, they can just say \"No\" and that's it, be it years or otherwise of familiarity. And dwelling or obsessing over your super special crushes who just seem like they would be such a good fit leads to behaviors that the people criticizing you in the first place probably spend a lot of time complaining about, like pedestalizing or clinginess or friendzone feelings.\n\nSome people are clearly and statistically more generally attractive than others, and since it's a relative criteria judged competitively, there will always be and always have been unattractive people in any society, sorry. Therefore the frequency in which someone has to 'branch out' is directly proportional to the percentage of the population that would typically find them attractive. Which means that yes, they have to ask out \"half the girls on campus\" ( hyperbole ) in order to maximize the possibility of someone liking them back to the same degree that a 6/10 dude might get a 60/40 chance on it. And yes, you'd have to move around all over the nightclub or swipe right on everything and anything on Tinder. \n\nIs doing that also going to be to their detriment? Absolutely, but that's the Catch 22 of the situation, like so many others which result in people ending up FA. If you don't play the number's game in equal compensation for your market value, then that's not going to work either. You'll get rejected by your friend of 3 years, rejected by that one girl you thought you could chive with at that one social event, repeat a few times and voila you're 30+ and still a KHHV. You can't find reciprocation at the same rate an average person does when you're not average, if they're betting on Columns at the roulette, you're playing on 1 Number ( straight ) and have to spin an appropriate number of times in order to win ( except the payoff is still the same ), and then you're accused of just being 'predatory' and thirsty.\n\nIronically, this principle also goes against one of the most touted ( Despite nobody ever checking to see if it isn't already the case ) mantras about how FA's must have high standards and should lower them ( Although in reality they were probably always as low as could be ). Do they understand that in order to 'lower standards', you must by definition separate individuals into tiers, not accounting for their uniqueness, and then learning to find compatible attributes in a much wider array of people than someone with average or high standards? Which means seeing a very large amount of people as prospective partners rather than a small amount based on an infinity of factors. \n\nSo in short, no, you can't really act like an average person does when you aren't, and you can't make very specific individuals feel as though you want to get to know them romantically or sexually more than anyone else, when the majority of your dating pool would never feel the same way about you.", "subreddit": "ForeverAlone"}

All motivation.\n\nI feel low, really low. \n\nI feel alone, even in a crowd of people, I feel like there will be no one who understands, no one who cares.\n\nI am a 30 year old guy, with a steady job, a roof over my head and food in the cupboards. \nI have a family who, despite seeing regularly, I feel distant from. \n\nI don\u2019t have many friends, the ones I do have I haven\u2019t seen in a while I might as well not count them. And the one friend I see often is an old friend from my school days and we have only really got back in touch a few months ago.\n\nI\u2019m single. And despite the loneliness I feel, don\u2019t feel like I would be any good in a relationship simply due to my current state of mind.\n\nAnd I am fed up. I am tired of putting on the smile day after day, just to make the people I do see think I am ok. \n\nI am numb. Empty. Lonely. \n\nAnd I am wondering whether it is all worth it. \n\nI lost my mum when I was thirteen. Two weeks after I turned thirteen to be honest. She had had cancer from when I was six, beat it, only for it to come back again the month after she was told to stop taking her medication.\n\nThat was my first step. I lost faith in religion, and began to become numb to loss. \n\nI don\u2019t remember much of her, nor do I remember much of my life as a kid... Hell, I can barely remember what I did last week. It worries me. I can\u2019t even remember the last time I was even remotely happy, let alone content.\n\nI have lost both my grandparents on both my mums and dads side of the family. \nI barely see my dad. He is happy enough with his new wife and her children and grand children. \nBut it bothers me that I am not that bothered by it. I should be. We are his blood, his children, but he doesn\u2019t seem to want to know us. I think last year I saw him three times. His birthday, my birthday and briefly at Christmas. Each time it was met with news of my step-sister or step-brother, and no, I don\u2019t see them ever. \n\nI lost an old school friend too. \nI had gotten him a job in my office after he left his last due to stress and depression.\nHe was coming on leaps and bounds, planning things with colleagues. Then he had an accident on his way home from work. \nI think I still feel guilty about him. \n\nAnd then there is my relationship status. \n\nI have been single for almost eight years. My ex cheated on me, and then, almost eighteen months after we broke up, she gave her son my name. \nWe got in contact again a few years ago, she had changed. I was glad, and was planning to take her for dinner for old times sake, but that never happened. \nI think I am glad about that too.\n\nSince we broke up, I found myself trying to get better jobs. I put all my time and effort in to work.\nWithout sounding too big headed, I feel as though I have done an amazing job keeping myself busy, I didn\u2019t notice it happening. \n\nI am sat here, watching Netflix. \nI say watching, it is on in the background, and I am not really paying attention to it. \nI am still numb.\n\nI wonder whether going in to work tomorrow is worth it. I have my usual thousand and one tasks to do as well as the thousand and two things I will get asked to do tomorrow too. \nI just lack the energy, the motivation, the will power to concentrate on it. \n\nI can\u2019t switch off. I don\u2019t get to sleep before 3am most days and I am up again at 6:30 am. I just can\u2019t turn off my head. \nI have tried sleep aids to no avail, \n\nI don\u2019t know what to expect from this. I don\u2019t even know whether I am expecting something out of this, just writing this I think simply as I don\u2019t think anyone else would listen. ", "subreddit": "lonely"}

I'm very introverted and really terrible at being social , especially with girls. Even if I'm near a girl that is clearly interested in me I'll always somehow talk myself out of being social and talking to her. It's like there is always a voice in my head telling me it's not worth it being social because I'm better off being alone. The truth is I do prefer being alone most of the time and being social for extended periods kind of tires me out and makes me want to be alone again sometimes, that's why I think I'm introverted. But at the same time I find myself really craving something like a girlfriend and for that I would have to be really social and talk to people , which is my main problem . part of it like it said is also confidence, that I sometimes feel like I'm just not good at being social so people won't enjoy talking to me even if I try. So basically im almost always very quiet and don't really talk to people other than my few close friends. I really want to improve on my self confidence and socializing skills so that people will see me as a more friendly person. Things I am trying now is standing up straight and saying hi to people more and smiling . I also try to improve my confidence by thinking of the things I'm good at as reasons that people would like talking to me. What's hard is often I am satisfied just being quiet and alone and thinking to myself for a while , but them this causes people to think I am not friendly don't want to be social. \n\nAnd advice from people who can relate to these feelings would be great. thanks!

I'm not entirely sure whether this post would go against the subreddit rules, but I could really do with a bit of help for some research I'm conducting for a new project of mine. (TL;DR below)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm studying Interior and Spacial Design at uni and my latest brief is redesign an old building to create a safe space to combat loneliness. I myself have dealt with it in the past after the untimely passing of my uncle. He was more like an older brother to me as he was closer to my age than to my dad, so when he died I spiralled a bit. I isolated myself from friends and family to the point where I ended up breaking down and not attending my college classes for over a month. I was lonely and depressed and I never want to go back to that place again. Its been just over 2 years now since my breakdown and the recovery process has been long and tiring but now I'm on the mend and I want to create the best space I can for this project. I could use my own experiences, but to create the most effective space possible I need to talk to as many people as possible.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm thinking about creating this space to help combat loneliness primarily in those who have suffered from the loss of a loved one and are still in the process of grieving. For this I need to know what people would like in a in a space solely dedicated to helping them. Despite my focus on post-loss loneliness, input from anyone suffering will be greatly welcomed regardless of situation. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**In essence, all I'm asking is that if you were to go to a designated space designed to help you combat your loneliness; a place where you can meet with other people also suffering; a calm and welcoming space just for you; what would you want? This can be anything from optional therapy, comfortable spaces, games etc etc.** \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSorry the post has been long!

Over the last few years I have grown my confidence socially quite a bit and made a fair few friends in my current job.

Most of the time I talk to someone for a bit but it never really went anywhere.

We both had similar outlooks on life and made each other laugh, she was super cute too.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI did try to keep myself from feeling too attached too quickly since I knew it was early days and I didn't want to be too naive. But I couldn't help but feel happy to be experiencing something that I'd started to think I never would, something that felt so alien and out of reach for me that for a long time I hadn't even considered it a possibility, I'd often forget it was a normal part of most peoples lives. It was just nice to feel like I had someone who cared about me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe went on a bunch of dates, and right up until the last date she seemed really enthusiastic and talked about how excited she was to see me again. During the last date she said she wasn't feeling well and left early, then she said she was busy whenever organising another date came up after that, and she slowly stopped talking. I've ran through everything we did to try and think of what I'd done to cause it.

I started googling things like anti-aging, longevity, how to find love, etc. I was actually perfectly normal and fine with my stake in life before, but it was like a switch was flipped in my brain.

I\u2019m a 20 year old female college student, and I have a boyfriend who loves me and I\u2019m close to my sister. I used to have a friend group who would hang out all the time, but now everybody has separated and is doing their own thing. My best friend for 10 years ignores my messages and is always too busy to hang out on weekends (when I\u2019m feeling the saddest). I see my boyfriend atleast 4 times a week, but I feel like he is my crutch. When I\u2019m with him I feel momentarily and temporarily fulfilled.  However I still have this aching feeling of loneliness because he hangs out with his friends a couple times a week, and knowing that he has such a solid group of friends makes me feel so sad and jealous. I know it sounds completely shallow, but I can\u2019t control these feelings. When he\u2019s out with his friends, I feel physically ill. My heart rate goes up, my chest starts to hurt, I become very cold and get goosebumps, can\u2019t eat without feeling like throwing up, and the list goes on. I guess you could say that I\u2019m an over thinker. Every little scenario or situation I over think and make the worst out of the situation. If one of my friends doesn\u2019t reply to a text, I automatically assume that they hate me or they\u2019re sick of me, or worst of all that they can sense my desperate need for connection. I\u2019m a nursing student and I should be focusing on my studies, but I can\u2019t concentrate because I feel so sad and alone. I look at my phone and see no messages and want to die. My boyfriend is the most supportive and amazing guy in the world, yet it still doesn\u2019t feel like enough. Nothing can patch up this empty hole in me. I\u2019m constantly on my phone reading posts about other people feeling lonely, or I watch YouTube videos on how to overcome loneliness etc etc. it\u2019s so freaking pathetic because I should be using my time and energy on studying. Also, I want to start going to the gym but I feel no motivation. I see other people out in public with their friend groups, and once again I spiral down deeper into depression. I want a group of friends more than anything. I go to community college and I talk to people there, but they are only acquaintances.

Awkward, passive men represent failure, not merely through their lack of charisma and a poor first impression  but  their inability to develop a network of friends and connections  which are an inherent part of how a man sells himself.\n\nOne only has to look at the statistics on relationship status of men with mental health problems, compared to women, and see how much more of an issue emotional frailty is for males.\n\nPeople  focus heavily on looks as a cope; blame it all on appearance rather than a complex web of problems that require a person address personality traits   deeply embedded from childhood. Of course appearance matters,  but so do these other factors, more than most FAs appear willing to admit.\n\nWithout a social network, the endorsement of others,   a clearly defined  personality and unburstable levels of self-esteem a man isn't capable of being much of anything to anyone, let alone an acceptable SO. Even decent enough looking men will struggle in the absence of these things.\n\nThe truth is 'normie' men almost always have a wide circle of friends before they get into relationships.

I was even joking and teasing her a bit right away, which is something I haven\u2019t been comfortable doing at all in recent memory. She was really friendly and bubbly, which is probably why I felt so comfortable with her (most times when I see a cute girl I just get really nervous around them even if I haven\u2019t talked to them).

Still, I felt regret about the way I sad bye to her.

We're not close, we just do standard small talk at family gatherings and I don't think we've ever talked just the two of us. That is, until a couple of days ago. I was at my sister's when she suddenly decided she had to go do something, leaving me alone with my BIL. At first things were pretty relaxed, then all of the sudden his body language changed and I could tell he was bracing to say something that made him uncomfortable. Since I had fairly recently gotten a new job, he asked me how things were going (he had already asked me earlier, which made it obvious he was just asking this as a segue). Then came the dreaded questions:\n\"How about the girls there, anyone cute? Anyone available? Anyone thats particurlaly interesting?\"  \n\nI gave some non-committal answers, said some generic joke and tried to direct the conversation elsewhere. He dropped it pretty quickly (and his body language when back to its normal, relaxed self).  \n\nMy take from this is that my sister asked my BIL to inquire about my romantic status. My sister and I aren't really close (she's very normal and I am not), we never really talk about personal stuff. I figure she thought it would be easier for me to talk about girls with a guy.  \n\nI suppose I should be glad that my sister cares, and that my BIL cared enough to do it.

Or maybe I'm pissed because of how clueless they are about not only me but also of how women, attraction and relationships work?

Girls approached me but I would only get embarrassed.

My lips are big and red and my I'm built like a plank (5'10, 130lbs). It feels like my self esteem revolves around how I look and how people percieve me. I don't know how to get over this shallowness but it always stays in my mind. I can't be myself, I don't even know if I have a 'self' because I always second guess myself and I'm really dependent on others. Any thoughts?", "subreddit": "ForeverAlone"}

I want to break stuff, to drink till I black out (I'm posting here tonight because I ran out of booze and the shops had closed already), to fight literally anyone I know and inflict this shit on someone else. Idk, I feel like a prisoner. I can sense my chances slipping away and my future going to shit but I can't find the TINY bit of effort to do something about this. And I think my real problem is that I can't talk about this in person. Thank fuck this is an anonymous post, but outside of my own headspace I don't actually trust my version of events?? Like, I contacted the university support services once and they've been fucking brilliant at getting back in contact with me but I don't trust myself to say anything so I'll just tell them everything is fine BECAUSE I'M AFRAID THEY'LL THINK I'M FUCKING LYING. Am I lying? I can't even fucking tell. Maybe I have a natural urge to repress this shit and hold it in, hey maybe I'm an attention seeking fucking cunt who actually has no real issues in the first place, invents shit to get out of work and obligations. I have these crazy moodswings from \"I want to fucking kill myself\" to \"Ahhhh I'm just being a pussy, forget about it and you'll feel fine tomorrow\". If you can't tell I had one just now. I feel fine now and at this point I'm writing for posterity because I need to get this shit out somehow. The issue is that I have these moodswings on a very regular basis and that it's always dangerous coping shit I do when I have them. Oh also I can't tell which perception is accurate because while I have them they both seem pretty good (and they're separated by fucking seconds).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIdk man, if you can empathise with my bullshit at all I imagine you're also pretty fucking bad at communicating. Please get in touch though, if literally anyone else can relate to this I'll feel a lot less crazy. I'll check back tomorrow I guess.", "subreddit": "lonely"}

Where I've been in contact with over 50 other people. The TDY is very busy with lots of work much being physically demanding and time consuming. I work along all +50 of these people, however I haven't had the opportunity to speak with 1 on 1 everyone in it. However, half way through it there came a moment where I had a 3-way conversation with 1 male and 1 female. It started off with just some small talk to kill some time. \n\nI've always felt I'm better in 3-way conversations due to it running smoothly with lots of topics being contributed by all the members, yet intimate enough to stay engaged. \n\nThen the male conversationist transitioned into another conversation going on with a group of other people on the TDY with us, yet myself and the female continued talking about our experiences and our lack of experiences in just about anything in life (not deep conversation topics though).\nIt turns out that she has lived a very 'sheltered' type of lifestyle, moreso than my own. I find this really attractive, as I've always found that I love sharing the moments another person experiences for the first time. (Weird e.g. I've seen a great classic movie, and friend hasn't, so we watch it together).\n\nThe conversation continues very naturally. I rarely experience this with the opposite gender and I found that talking to this person was intoxicating, and that I'd enjoy speaking with her again.\n\nFF a day or so, and we spark up another conversation basically getting to know more about each other, and still, the conversation proceeded to run it's course smoothly. This continues on for a couple days, however most of the time they are forcibly halted due to work on the TDY (which separates us into different work groups). Which in turn works great for me because running out of things to say is a death sentence for conversations for obvious reasons. This also helped me keep an idea of how to continue the conversation next time we run into each other.\n\nFF to a couple days ago. I strike up a conversation with her to continue sharing interests and thoughts on various topics. However, what I thought was very rudely interrupted by another female who too was on the TDY with us. Me, being the reasonable person I am, allowed their injects to the conversation and tried to show interest by including her in the conversations I was having with the woman I usually talk with. However the person I am interested in did not show so much interest in her injects and primarily focused on what I had to say in the conversations. I noticed queues of her looking at me before... rather than the other girl talking when ...I turned my head in her direction temporarily. \n\nAnyways, every time there was an opportunity too; we would mutually approach each other when we could to strike up conversation, however I would still and up doing it more so. These conversations are really entertaining for me and we share VERY similar interests almost shockingly so.\n\nNow I tell you guys this. Even though it's only been a week of conversations with this person I feel like there very well could be a possibility for a relationship (BTW we never talked about past relationships so IDK much about that, I'm assuming she's not in one otherwise might not have paid as much attention to our conversations as much as I would like to think.\nSo my predicament is this. Our TDY is going to end very soon and once it ends we will be split half way across the earth. In this short time frame of work, never have I ever felt so connected and relatable with a member of the opposite gender. Thinking about this (and I know this could just be my FA brain) I might never ever meet another person like her. It's almost as if she were my possible SO, and we haven't discovered/made it so yet. It's so unbelievably awesome that I can connect with someone like I do with her that it's almost like a pipe dream thinking about it \n\nAnd that's all it ever will be, because I don't have the courage to ask her if she wants a relationship. I also fear that if we were to get into a relationship, we would only have a few hours before we are separated by vast geography making seeing each other in person very costly, and we all know how long distance relationships usually end up. \n\nI bought a simple gift for her before she leaves however I'm debating on whether or not to go for it. Do I ask her or do I keep it friendly, or do I just not mention a gift to her and wish her farewell. (BTW when I asked her for her FB cause I would like at the very least to be FB friends in case our paths ever cross again, she ended up giving me her IG as well as her number.)\n\nAnd now, j. The present of writing this, I really want to ask her but IDK how I could feel about the response(s) that could incur. She is within an area with most of the people from the TDY and we probably won't get the opportunity to to naturally go to a more private section to speak with her. (Don't want to be embarrassed by everyone). But I have a feeling my FA instinct will kick aun and force me to not do anything but carry on as just a friendly person. It's soul crushing knowing that I may continue being FA due to my own self. \n\nI just wanted to share with you guys this because I'm my own reason for being FA. I know some of you have uncontrollable conditions that you may have, and I too feel like I am ugly, however with this encounter, I feel as if there is a chance for me yet, but my ownself is what defiles my mind.\n\n\nTo those of you who made it this far, thank you for taking the time out of your day to read my struggle with myself and my inability to gain a SO.\n\n\nTerms used\nTDY - military term\nFF - fast forward", "subreddit": "ForeverAlone"}

I told him to text me and let me know what day over the weekend they're gonna go to the movies and I'll join them. The weekend goes by and nothing. I didn't think of it as anything, I just assumed they never went because I know people are busy and have other things to deal with. \n\nMonday comes along. I found out they all went without me. \n\nI'm starting to cry typing this knowing no one wants to hang out with me or want to know me or be a friend. I'm a boring ugly person to begin with so I dont blame them. Maybe I'm meant to be alone for the rest of my life, which probably won't be much longer anyway. ", "subreddit": "lonely"}

Most of our evolution comes from HG society where it was vital to have a tribe or group you cared for and that cared for you. You did stuff together etc. I think that still sticks today. We are the most happy with others. I think it's a coping mechanism to \"learn to have fun with yourself\". You can't have fun at a restaurant, bar, vacation, hiking trip etc. alone. \n\nWhen I was in elementary school, I had plenty of friends and I was at my happiest in my life. Suddenly, in 8th grade with the transition to lower secondary school, I just lost them all. It was a mix of arguments and simply me not being cool enough, partially due to being not attractive and not being able to talk to women. Later on in 9th grade I sorta made a few friends, but it was never the same, I never even visited them and they have no visited me. We barely hung outside school. \n\nLater on in high school I did make some friends again, and same story, hung very rarely, almost always with drinking involved. However, the worst was to come. Now that I am in my early 20's, we all are studying and off course everyone has new friends.... Except me. I have no hung with those \"friends\" now in like a month and it doesn't look like we're getting any closer...... I now fear I'll probably totally lose them, we only communicate in a group chat from time to time. That's what fucking sucks the most. Everyone, except me, constantly make new friends, not me. During the last two months, aside from my part time job and my classes, I've just been sitting at home contemplating how fucking miserable my life is. I don't see any light at the end of the tunnel. \n\nFriendlessness is probably the worst feeling ever. I even met a girl off tinder, but she lives 2 hours away from me. I do meet her around twice a month, I don't feel like that's enough? I used to even be a incel, but a woman does not seem to help as much as I thought. She can't replace having a group of bros. She can't fix not having friends. It's off course better than having no one, but it's still very hard. The most painful feeling is that I could, today, be told that I have absolute free-time for two weeks straight and apart from meeting that girl maybe once, I would do fucking nothing other than rot in my room. No going out to eat, going to a bar, going to the cinema. I wouldn't have anyone to do anything with. ", "subreddit": "ForeverAlone"}

But after a few months of hanging out with them I pushed them away due to my low self esteem and self worth, and they even told me I acted weird and 'alien'. Since then I've been smoking almost daily, getting pot through my brother. Pot has been an escape for me, and I loved it the first year or two I took it, but within this last year I had many epiphanies while high and the euphoric hallucinogenic feeling wore off and was replaced with rumination and self analyzation. I realized how weird of a person I was, how awkward I am, and basically it revealed all of my flaws to me.

The bullying I've received at high school made me what I am today. Someone that is afraid to intimate with any girl and someone that feels he will never be able to nor deserves it. You see, for me getting a gf not only seems something distant and that will never happen now, it's also becoming something that I am accepting.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNot only I am socially awkward at different situations, there was also a point in my life that for some reason my speech got fucked; basically I am not fluid when I talk, I make pauses, I stutter and I often miss pronounce words even if I know how they are structured and pronounced on my mind. I also have a underbite, meaning that I can't smile properly at all, makes me feel even more abnormal and strange, as if the rest of stuff in my life wasn't enough.\n\nI used to work out and tried to motivate myself, now I just don't care. I have a belly, I've gotten fat because it seems like the \"gf thing\" is just not for me.

How could I make a move since high school girls that liked me ended up seeing me as a sore loser due to the heavy bullying?\n\n The closest girl I have been close was named Eva and I fell in love with her, that was not so long ago, it was at course about a job I was gonna perform. She also payed a lot of attention to me, I also started to work out a bit at that time and also I was on a NoFap period. I behaved more Alpha and less Beta, asked her out. She said yes. Then the low self-esteem train came and I did nothing and eventually, distance divided us. I was afraid she would reject me if she saw more of me and now I think I am hopeless forever. Another drop dead gorgeous girl would also give me some flirty looks and I would look back at her, talk a bit. But that was it. No moves by me, fear consumes me, deep inside I feel like a loser.

We stopped talking so much and we weren't aware of what was going on in each other's lives as much as we used to be. But we still consider each other best friends and even brothers. We've told each other 'love you' plenty of times and still do but I can't shake off this feeling that he doesn't really care about me and let me explain why:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI've been going through a lot of stuff this past year to the point where I've changed a lot (mostly for the better):\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* I went through anxiety and depression\n* I went through my parents moving here and living with me\n* Got addicted to marijuana to the point where I failed classes for three semesters; quit abusing it and slowly working on deleting my unhealthy relationship with weed\n* Went through loneliness (still working on it) and practically having no friends\n* Went through accepting my sexuality and being comfortable with who I am and whom I like\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEvery single conversation we've had this past year has been about him, about his problems with his girlfriend and his friend/roommate, about his problems with his uncle and his wife, about his struggles in school, and about him going through a mild depressive episode.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI always make an effort to know what he's thinking and what he's going through and always ask him how his day is. He doesn't do any of those. I feel extremely neglected and this friendship feels one-sided. I keep telling myself that I am seeing this from the wrong perspective and am not in my right state of mind to come to a conclusion whether I should end this friendship or not. My mind has tricked me plenty of times before into taking decisions that were not in my best interest and I've seen first hand how powerful a shift in perspective can be so I am looking for a sign or a chance to change my mind's mind but every time we talk, I am let down and see more and more signs that he doesn't care about me or truly love me. I feel like I keep giving him chances to prove me wrong and he's only proving me right. I talked to another person about it and she mentioned that if it's come to the point where I'm doubting our friendship and not feeling loved anymore, then maybe it is true. She went on to say that I am an amazing person and I deserve to have friends that care about me and that's been stuck in my head since then.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI do deserve friends and family that care about me and I don't feel like being the second-hand in the lives of the people that are closest to me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe same situation applies to my parents. My sexuality has seriously made me doubt whether my parents will truly accept me and love me for who I am. I have a strong feeling that my dad truly loves me and I am not being fair to him by not allowing myself to get close to him. Once I realized that, I tried to make up for the time lost and am working on building a stronger relationship with my dad. My mother, on the other hand, is the complete opposite:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* She's self-centered and shallow. I feel like she doesn't really love me, she loves the idea of me - of having a son that will give her grandkids in the future.\n* She does these little things that trigger my brain to think that she only cares about herself like continuously interrupting me when trying to have a conversation, jumping from one thing to another so that it's only her doing the talking and not even giving me a chance to talk at all.\n* I feel like she has not taken the time or the effort to know me for who I am. I hadn't seen my parents for five years prior to them moving here and I am taking the effort and time to know them for who they are now and not who they were five years ago. I have changed a lot and grown a lot and she doesn't care about that.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAt this point, I don't have the energy to put in more work into building a better relationship with her - she completely drains my energy and she's such a negative person that affects my mood and how I behave so I am trying to spend as little time with her and stay as far away as I can. I honestly feel suffocated by my mother\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy parents, my aunt and her family, and my best friend are the people closest to me and yet I feel like I am not getting the love I need or deserve. I am getting more love from my boss and my coworkers and my professors and new friends that I am making at school than from my \"family\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I wrong for seeing it this way? Am I being too selfish and focusing too much on my needs when I should be putting more of an effort into getting to know people and building an emotional attachment/connection with them and as a result, build a friendship or a relationship?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOn other other hand, I feel like I am wasting too much time worrying about what other people think about me or whether they truly love me. I should just fucking cut them off my life and move on trying to be happy. And I would do that in a heartbeat if I were truly convinced that they don't care about me but my mind keeps giving me mixed signals.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI don't know what to feel anymore or what to do. This feeling has been hazing me for a whole year and I feel stuck.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI am 23 years old and I know what I want out of a friendship or relationship and this is not it.

I could have never imagined that a girl like her can like someone like me. I'm a 35 year old man with no experience with women at all so I have no idea of my sexual marketplace value.\n\nYou would think finding this out would make me very happy and positive.  \nBut no.  \nNow the issues and disappointment for myself started with full force.  \n\n\nShe lives in the town next to me.

As a 35 year old man without any experience with women I never had to work on myself, I just basically have given up on that front.

I am currently a university student and have *little* to no friends. I\u2019ll try to tell you my story:\n\n      I\u2019m currently a sophomore attending university, and I have no solid friend group. Freshman year of uni, I was able to make my own group of friends \u2014 there were five of us. We did everything together: ate together everyday, did HW together, spent time in the dorms until the early hours of the morning etc. All was good. But after awhile, our friend group started to dissolve. I\u2019ll spare you all the details but just know: it was toxic. I had to leave that situation because the friendship was sinking. Towards the end of freshman year that\u2019s when everything was officially over. Since I had the impression \u201cwe were all gonna be best friends forever\u201d and \u201cthese were the people I was gonna talk to after graduation,\u201d I tried my best to stay and fix the situation \u2014 it was all for nothing. I had spent so much time with them that I neglected making any new friends freshman year, which was completely my fault. Coming back sophomore meant I had to start from scratch. I\u2019m in the middle of sophomore year, and I don\u2019t see any improvement. Ofc there are a few people I meet up with here and there, but I mostly keep to myself. I\u2019m tired of eating alone, walking alone, having fun alone \u2014 I want to enjoy it with a group of people. I *wish* I had a group of friends who I could meet up everyday, be on their Snapchat stories, and just have people to talk/rant too (ofc I would do the same for them). \n\n     What makes me mad about this the most is that I *did* this to myself. Why did I exclusively stay with my old group of friends freshman year? Why didn\u2019t I bother opening up to other people? Why am I struggling so hard just to meet new people now? I ask myself these questions everyday. I have been alone for most of my life, but I thought uni would be different. I *was* sooo wrong. I know I could be alone, but I\u2019m just tired of it.

What should I do?", "author": "JLReaper", "self_text": " \n\nI   normally don\u2019t like discussing my personal life online, but in this   case, I feel that I have no other option. For many years now, more than I   would like to admit, I\u2019ve been extremely depressed. Nothing gives me   any joy, happiness, or contentment. To make matters worse, I have a very   uncaring family, one that doesn\u2019t seem interested in helping me, let   alone actually accepting me. They call me selfish and ungrateful, like   it\u2019s my fault that I\u2019m filled with misery, most of which I can\u2019t escape.   Alone and with no one to talk to, I stay up late into the night,   occasionally until sunrise. They call me lazy and unproductive, even   though I get very little sleep. In the last two years, maybe even three,   I haven\u2019t slept more than five hours, and that\u2019s on a good night. No   matter how many times I tell them, regardless of how hard I try, they   don\u2019t seem to understand that these are symptoms of my depression. In   other words, they blame me, not the illness.\n\nI   have no job, no girlfriend, and no future. After going to college for   three years, learning one useless thing after another, I dropped out,   certain that higher education didn\u2019t really suit my needs. Due to a   disability that I have, one that cannot be seen by the naked eye, I do   not have the ability to drive a car. My fine motor skills are impaired,   making it very difficult for me to perform complex tasks with my hands,   such as tying knots and driving cars. From food to transportation, I\u2019m   completely dependent on my parents. I\u2019m trapped in my house so much,   often very alone, that I feel like I\u2019m going to go insane. I can go an   entire month without leaving the house, occasionally even longer.   Whenever my parents leave the house, it's always very early in the   morning, which is a very bad time for me, to say the least. They won't   go anywhere in the afternoon, irrespective of how many times I beg them   to. My father seems to think that I have some kind of sinister motive,   as if I'm using my depression to get my own way, my every action one of   manipulation and malice.\n\nMore than   anything else, I long to have a kind and supportive wife, one that will   love and comfort me. Unfortunately, due to my situation, meeting people   can be very difficult, if not downright impossible. I've tried online  dating, but most women don't respond to me, and of the few who do  respond, when they discover that I don't have a car, they stop  contacting me. Even if I could  meet people, most women want men with  money and status, not starving  artists. Around where I live, which is  in a very small town, most of the  women are white trash. I want an  intelligent and worldly woman,  specifically a woman who will teach me,  guide me, and give me  confidence. Most likely, I will never find this  woman, at least not in  the near future. In the meantime, I would still  like someone to talk to,  preferably someone that I can meet in person,  not just online. I've tried contacting my friends from high school, but  they have no interest in seeing me. To tell you the truth, other than  being somewhat shy, we never really had that much in common anyway.\n\nAs   an author, I\u2019ve written several books, all of which haven\u2019t done that   well. I used to write a lot, but ever since my latest episode of   depression, I have hardly written anything. My books tend to be very  metaphorical and poetic, two styles of writing that are very unpopular,  to say the least. I constantly get bullied for self-promoting, even on  forums that are for self-promotion. Every week is the same, each  moment  another reminder of how dark and lonely my life is. My future,  what\u2019s  left of it, is bleak and without hope, comparable to a lost and  lonely  graveyard. I'd love to move, and maybe even find some friends, but as   of now, I can't afford it. My heart is beating very fast, the   loneliness almost too much to bear. On some nights, long after everyone   else is asleep, I will occasionally come close to having a nervous   breakdown. My life is empty, occupied with nothing except silent and   negative thoughts, nine out of ten of them being extremely harmful. I   would just like some advice, any at all, that could help me cope with my   situation.\n\nDo you know what the  saddest part of all of this is? Most of this post wast written three  years ago, and nothing, literally nothing, has changed. After writing  this post, I developed chronic nerve pain, sometimes referred to as  fibromyalgia,  just one of many conditions that has crippled my life. At  this point, the prospect of getting a job looks, at best, very grim. I  hate, with every fiber of my being, the idea of working a job that I  have no passion for. There are so few realistic options available to me,  and all of them are terrible. Ironically enough, my current situation  seems to be the least objectionable option. Unless some type of miracle  occurs, I don't see how my situation will ever change.

Cliques were exclusive and adherence to rigid social norms triply so. Proms were a forgone conclusion. My parents always asked why I didn't go. It wasn't as if I didn't want to. I did. Achingly so. My crushes in the past would always show interest and even agree to my proposal for dates with an enthusiastic \"yes' and then promptly pretend I didn't exist when they considered the social consequences for associating with me on a romanic level.  Sometimes I wouldn't get that far. Sometimes they ignored me or rejected me outright. The worst thing about continuous rejection is that you don't know what's causing your perpetual isolation. You don't conform to society. That's been you since (immaculate) conception.  But does that mean you're doomed to feel unwanted and inferior when your every attempt to connect with people is met with spite or cold ambivalence? People kissed in the halls as I peered despairingly on. What did they have that I didn't? Was I too ugly? Too obtuse? Too quiet? It's hard to describe the distinct sense of nonbeing you feel as a loner around \"normal\" people. They don't grasp your brand of humor, your offbeat pop culture references, your dress, or your choices in music. You want just one female to talk about Tame Impala, Amy Winehouse, Sade, Frank Ocean, Bjork, OutKast, Prince, Kate Bush, Devil May Cry, Witcher, Inuyasha or Star Wars with. That person never comes because your crushes never gave you a chance.\n\nNow this tangent isn't to say I lacked social grace. I felt some of those people were quite smitten with **me** but not with my status as an implicitly defiant iconoclast. I saw the blushes, the dilated eyes, and the half concealed toothy grins. That's what got me then. I couldn't even get a first date to show that I was worth **someone's** time because I was an outcast. Did my otherness matter that much? It was like reduced social viability by association (that Lenny Kravitz looking kid). Nuance was possessed that no one had bothered to find despite my many invitations. I have memories of backtracking, \"Actually I have softball on Friday, I **might** be able to make the play,\" (spolier: she didn't), obfuscation, (wrong number gimmick), refusal, \"I'm not that kind of girl,\" outright vitriol, \"Why are you standing so close to me?\" (you mean like the distance people stand when they talk to other people? Oh, I guess I'll just go drive this pen through my eye instead), or the most common one, they'd pretend I didn't exist after agreeing to a date. It isn't that these females owe me shit. They don't. I'd rather them say no directly. It's when there's clearly a spark and the girl ghosts me once I act on it. Why? Because I'll never compromise for other people. As much as it sucks to be alone all the way through my senior of high school, I never sold my soul to be liked.....because I wasn't. But I'll be damned if my insistence on eccentricity in the face of all odds won't serve me well in the future. I mean, really. The average kid would say, \"I should probably cut the hair or lose the boots or the Purple Rain shirt.\" But not me.\n\nI'm 17 without a first kiss/girlfriend/date/prom/anythingpastfriendsadly.

(Or just skip to the bottom to the TLDR)\n\nIt\u2019s been about 5 years since I\u2019ve been social with anyone outside of my family. In 2014 I was asked to leave high school due to my essentially non-existent grades. And the fact that I was skipping pretty much every class I was enrolled in. I also never went to detention when they put it on the table. \n\nThis all started when I was 11-12 I was becoming extremely angry, enough that I would lash out my mom and hit her*. Then came the sweeping depression and constant anxiety and panic attacks. So off to the doctor I went they diagnosed me as depressed they gave me Prozac and sent me off. \n\nWell that didn\u2019t work. In three years time I had been put in an inpatient care facility for suicidal thoughts and severe depression three times. Once out-patient care and twice in-patient on my last trip there they started me on a med called Geodon. And it worked wonders. I was more stable than I had ever been before. \n\nBut then Sanford dropped me as a patient, because I wasn\u2019t showing up to my appts and not taking my meds right. So we found St. Sophies and my new doctor. Almost within the first visit he realized I had been misdiagnosed and diagnosed me as bipolar 1 with ADHD. (This was after I had been kicked out of school) \n\nThen after I left school I really drifted away from my friends I never texted, called, we never hung out. And that was my fault I let myself get stuck in this rut where I didn\u2019t do anything or go anywhere. Eventually I got my GED in 2016. But I haven\u2019t done anything since I\u2019ve got myself in this dark place where I have no motivation to do anything. The only people I ever see are my family and I love my family but everywhere I look I see happy people with their friends and their So. And I immodestly judge them and irrationally hate them because I want what they have. \n\nI have no social skills anymore. I live with my mom( who by the way is a saint, I don\u2019t know how she put up with all of the shit I\u2019ve put her through but she continues to love and support me no matter what) which isn\u2019t that bad. I\u2019m on the cusp of getting my first job, which will not be easy at 21 with no job experience whatsoever. \n\nBut I\u2019ve just realized something that I\u2019ve always known, I haven\u2019t spoken to anyone outside of family and family friends in 5 years. Everyone around me has someone close to them that they love. And I\u2019m just me, myself and I. And I\u2019m getting a little scared that that will last forever.\n\n\nTLDR: due to mental illness I left high school in 2014 and cut off all contact from my friends. During the last 5 years I haven\u2019t had any social interaction aside from my family. And I just want  that to change.\n\n", "subreddit": "lonely"}

Many people seemed to relate to this, it got hundreds of comments and reactions. This seemed to imply that those people actually have close friends that they hang out with, and this made me feel even more miserable by comparison.

I have suffered from crippling loneliness and chronic suicidal depression since I was 11.

We text each other a lot about work and stuff (we have the same dark sense of humour), and kind of flirt a lot when I visit my old workplace. I could honestly say we would be absolutely perfect for each other. We share a lot of the same interests outside work, too. We initially bonded over being cat persons (which I can usually tell very easily), and we have the same type of real life cynicism. \n\n...and yet, at the end of the day, the romantic connection just isn't there.

My brother took a picture of the other guy lying on the ground, and in my opinion it's a miracle the cops haven't showed up to arrest my brother yet.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy uncle thinks it's a normal part of finding one's identity as a teenager, especially as an Asian kid who is trying to find his way as an outsider in his own society. You would think my parents would be more sympathetic to this angle, given that they faced discrimination as Chinese in Indonesia. But it devolved into a fight because my parents tried to use me as an example of the kind of person my brother should be, and this time I actually stood up to my parents. I told them my little brother did the right thing in fighting that other guy and my brother is all the things I wish I could have been in high school. I could have gone further with this but of course I didn't tell my parents the whole truth: I'm 27 and a KHHV, with over 150+ rejections asking women out in real life, I have a great job but I come home to an empty apartment every day wanting nothing more than to just a take nice leaping swan drive off my balcony. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy uncle took my brother and I out for ice cream in the city after dinner, and we both told my little brother that we love him how he is and that we're proud. As we were eating the ice cream my uncle asked me how I was doing, and not wanting to sully the mood I didn't tell them everything although I did say I'm still having trouble with women (they both know I'm a virgin).  It was definitely one of the better nights I've had in a while. It's nice to know I have an uncle \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;", "subreddit": "ForeverAlone"}

{"post_id": "b1w5pv", "created_utc": 1552764056, "title": "Overcoming nervousness through contained anger", "author": "Drenzard", "self_text": "So, this is something which personally works for me a lot, but which maybe some people aren't going to like precisely because it's different than standard normie platitudes, but maybe people who have issues with nervousness in interactions could make some use of it if they haven't before. This isn't intended as a way of becoming more appealing to women or normal guys either, that's another topic entirely which depends on many factors, a lot of which ( as we know ) beyond individual 'control'. This is just about eliminating traces of nervousness.\n\nI'm going to keep it simple. When you're interacting with 'another member of the pack', AKA another human, or someone you're sexually attracted to especially, and and are keenly aware of being of a lower social value than they are ( Which if that's the case, is often so because previous observations have shown it to be objectively true ) for a variety of reasons, the instinctual nervousness and uncertainty is the brain going into it's \"fight or flight\" mode, deciding what approach to take to the perceived 'threat' ( That is how the hindbrain perceives it ). And when normies say 'fake it till you make it' or 'just be yourself' or 'stop worrying' and other kinds of stuff, what they're telling you is to basically just turn off that mode. \n\nThis is often found to be exceedingly difficult to do in the heat of the moment, since your own brain designed to protect you is opposing that course of action, simply shutting down it's defenses, because it actually knows what's best for you - if you 'slip up' in a conversation with your social betters while not erring on the side of caution, they can, will, and have pick up on it and possibly make your situation a lot worse, as I'm sure there's no need to tell anyone here, which is why 'fight or flight' is indeed necessary in those situations. On the other hand maybe when talking to some nerdy guy or homeless old dude on the street you won't feel it at all if your brain perceives no social risk involved.\n\nWhat might be easier however is to try turning 'flight' into 'fight'. It usually won't happen at first because your subconscious doesn't think it could win that fight, and it's right. Most FA's wouldn't be able to, most of the men or women giving FA's shit *are* ( through their looks, connections, sharpness, gender etc.. ) able to.  But what you can do is goad yourself into imagining the situation as desperate enough that you'll 'fight' even against all odds, like a kamikaze pilot plunging to his death.\n\nHow to do that? When you're in the middle of it and focused on it entirely, it's hard to get your thoughts together, but what I'd do is just rationally memorize it out loud in your mind that every time you get nervous and subdued, you're letting all the bullying and Halo Effect and discrimination and social expectations dictate your behavior and trying hard not to possibly 'put off' people who themselves never had to think twice about doing everything they please being as upfront as they'd like, literally accepting the position of a second-class human being who needs to keep their head down or something. And not only that, you're making it even worse for yourself, looked down upon even more. And rather than just ignore everything or pretend otherwise, allow yourself to get worked up about it by constantly drilling that, verbatim, in your mind, trying to change the flight mode to the other one. Each moment you find yourself slipping up again should be the moment that you remember what is happening again - acting like a second-class human.\n\nThis doesn't mean exuding aggression rather than nervousness to whoever you're talking to, that should be reserved for when they don't treat you equally if you choose to, after all anyone who spends even one minute around normies or watching virtually any candid social documentary knows socially successful can get angry over the most stupid stuff, be it a football team or 'microaggression' or someone leaving their dish somewhere or whatever all the time, so you can easily allow yourself to demand respect if they don't like the non-subdued but nominally easygoing version of you, and if you can't get that ( probably won't ) then might just terminate contact. What you should channel that aggression into is the very idea that you would be required, by virtue of who you are, to resign yourself into a demeanor that someone else wouldn't.\n\nIf you can psyche yourself up enough about it through repetition, you might be able to do something that just saying \"Oh I need to fake something, I need to surpass that emotion\" won't do, which is to enlist the fight or flight mechanism and it's associated neurochemical releases in the opposite direction, which is by the way also what training coaches might do when trying to evoke anger in someone to get their adrenaline rushing. As compared to just trying to surpass it entirely, the body's 'fight' reaction is infinitely more powerful and could feel like a sun suddenly blaring up against the nervousness. You know who else benefited from this technique, your highschool bullies when they went around picking fights or being confrontational all the time. Now you don't have to be like them, but most socially successful guy still keep that in the back of their head, and you'd always get the vibe of how they're always ready for a case of confrontation while still keeping it cool with those they want to.\n\nNow, normie advice would also try to inform you that if you lost the nervousness, it never served any purpose whatsoever except just holding you back and everything is going to be rainbows and sunshine with more \"confidence\". This is of course false on so many levels it would be hard to even count for them. Discrimination against people for their status or immutable characteristics existed and still exists for many reasons throughout history, and the ones who 'overstepped' their social position often suffered for it and still do. There are plenty of psychological studies and plenty of articles and examples from reddit itself to illustrate it. Tons of people would much prefer a toothless, poor homeless guy keeping to himself rather than one who thinks he's like some fit college dude with sunglasses and backward baseball cap who can just joke about anything freely and start conversations with people anywhere and be responded to with a smile. Losing nervousness isn't very related to making yourself more likeable, though depending how 'bad' things are, maybe it will in some cases, but only do it if you just feel like it for no particular reason. In many cases it might even have the opposite effect, you'll be treated negatively for the lack of subservience.\n\nWhich is why I said before it should be seen as a Kamikaze mission. It's a Sword of Damocles type of deal, the better off you are and the more you have to lose from 'making misteps', in terms of social acceptance or reputation or whatever, the harder it's going to be. But if you're at rock bottom, especially suicidal, if you decided that your life is just not worth living whatsoever in a certain state, then it might be easier. You do stand to lose a lot but maybe you already determined it's over. Let the individuals who want to throw you into the pile of men who 'overstepped their boundaries' keep fighting and remove more and more people from normal life just like they did with lepers or people of a certain orientation or skin tone, because apparently that's probably what it takes.\n\nSo basically, for people who think nervousness is a problem for them, this might be useful to take into consideration, but don't take it as more than that.", "subreddit": "ForeverAlone"}

(An Advice Thread)", "author": "Fixed_Assets", "self_text": "This is aimed as advice for the young men, but is probably valuable insight for the women too:\n\nI see a lot of posts on the board about missed opportunities and assumptions men make about women, particularly women they are interested in being attracted to them.  I also see a trope more often than not in here about how it's a big issue that men generally tend to avoid picking up on signals that women are attracted to them and that this is why they are FA.\n\nPretty much all of these things are not particularly true.  In fact, quite the opposite is true - men generally tend to overestimate how attracted women are to them, especially if they are attracted to the woman themselves.  And this doesn't just apply to female friends, but to how men see women in general:\n\n&gt; \"Men were much more attracted to their female friends than vice versa. Men were also more likely than women to think that their opposite-sex friends were attracted to them\u2014a clearly misguided belief. In fact, men\u2019s estimates of how attractive they were to their female friends had virtually nothing to do with how these women actually felt, and almost everything to do with how the men themselves felt\u2014basically, males assumed that any romantic attraction they experienced was mutual, and were blind to the actual level of romantic interest felt by their female friends. Women, too, were blind to the mindset of their opposite-sex friends; because females generally were not attracted to their male friends, they assumed that this lack of attraction was mutual. As a result, **men consistently overestimated the level of attraction felt by their female friends and women consistently underestimated the level of attraction felt by their male friends.**\"\n\nI post none of this to discourage men from being friends with women.  I am on good acquaintence terms with women at work and one of my good friends now (and one I've had in the past) are women and I consider those relationships to be rewarding.  But I am not attracted to either of them and that's the key.  This kind of study demonstrates why men generally tend to complain more about the friendzone than women - they are more likely to have that one-sided feeling and assume the other women feels the same.  And when she says she doesn't, he's more likely to feel betrayed and angered that he \"led him on\" even if the lead-ons were pretty much all in his head and/or misinterpreted signs of friendship.\n\nMy key takeway: If you are a guy, make sure you actually know what female attraction looks like.  Go out with a normie person and see how women respond to him - that's what I did and it was eye opening.  Also, if you are going to be friends with women, be friends with women you aren't attracted to.  They can still be good companions and offer insight you wouldn't normally get from dude friends.  It's also a decent thing to do to not ignore and pretend women you aren't attracted to don't exist.  And don't get pissed off at women who were \"leading you on\" unless she was being obvious about it (like openly flirting with you before asking you to do stuff for her) - it is entirely possible you misinterpreted friendliness as something more.\n\nAnd for the ladies - be sure to keep this in mind when you are friends with a dude.  If you are aware that you may be underestimating his level of attraction to you, his sudden \"confession\" won't seem like such a betrayal of trust.  And don't get pissed when he doesn't want to be friends anymore - you don't owe him sex or a relationship, but he doesn't owe you friendship either.  You were probably just fine without the guy before anyway and he's doing you a favor by removing potential drama from your life!\n\nSource: https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/men-and-women-cant-be-just-friends/\n\n*edit: I acknowledge the fact that this advice probably won't apply for a good portion of people here, especially the hermits and people who don't have friends at all, I acknowledge that you have bigger problems to deal with and I respect that.  Having said that, I see so many posts here about guys asking how they should \"confess\" to their female friends and asking if a girl likes him because she brushed up against his jacket as she was leaving class or some mundane bullshit like that and felt this had to be said*", "subreddit": "ForeverAlone"}

But always found each other again. Sometimes we\u2019d just be tearing each other apart for different reasons, maybe just to get each other to react. Sometimes. Sometimes we were so fucking in love, sometimes I felt the most joy I\u2019ve ever felt in my life to date. But we were so young. \n\nUntil a few years ago, that\u2019s how it was, even when we weren\u2019t \u201cdating\u201d she was mine and I was hers. On paper it\u2019s all very dysfunctional, but when we were alone, it\u2019s so different. It\u2019s like this version that\u2019s easier to explain to your friends and parents because of mistakes on both parts. But the truth being veiled and intense. Her constantly trying to keep me out of her skin, me trying to get her to admit it at times. It almost because a sick game that I grew to love. Forcing her to admit it. Making her show me she loves me or lose me. \n\nI suppose it escaped me that initially I just wanted her to love me openly. Unconditionally. The thing that was always lurking under the surface though is I was never truly good enough. But, we\u2019ll get to that. The really sick part is, when I first met her, she was my first true love, I was not hers. It was the boy from the home town that she had unfinished business with. How much that killed me, I don\u2019t think she ever knew. \n\nBut really, it\u2019s not all her fault I ended up lonely. Sure, I\u2019m not good enough. I get it now, but that\u2019s only one genre of sin we committed. I knew from the minute I saw her, walking down the hill from high school registration I needed to talk to that girl, god she was beautiful. The grey sweater, the peace sign necklace (she swears she never liked peace signs yet wears in her year book photo silly girl) those tight blue pants and vans. Gorgeous blonde hair, green eyes, silky white skin, I haven\u2019t been attracted to blondes until that moment. I digress. \n\nI\u2019m not sappy but, I\u2019ll be damned if it wasn\u2019t fate, love at first sight. The real kicker, my best friend was good friends with her best friend at the time. I couldn\u2019t believe my luck, there she was. Standing next to my future frenemy, the very two people who\u2019d hurt me the most. So I walk over and play it cool and greet my friend and ask him about the girl I don\u2019t really care about. Her name is Alisha, then I ask the most beautiful human being I\u2019d ever seen what her name is, Breezy. Sipping her Starbucks nonchalantly. The Angel in my nightmares.  \n\nWe get to walking home and talking, I\u2019ll be honest it\u2019s been so long, I don\u2019t recall what we spoke about, I don\u2019t have a good memory, but I do remember being so overjoyed to be breathing the same air as this goddess in front of me. Getting her to laugh and smile. She was so pretty. We end up getting to Alisha\u2019s grandmas house at the time, (I think) then we say our goodbyes I hug her and I don\u2019t remember if I had the nerve to get her phone number or MSN account for instant messenger. (Yeah, back in the day. \ud83d\ude05)\n\nWithin a week of school starting we started hanging out and walking around and talking a lot. Little did I know the very beginning would lead to so much heart ache and struggle. I asked her in a very corny way to be mine, she accepted and I was over the moon. I had a lot more confidence back then because a lot of girls were virgins and inexperienced whereas I had lost my virginity at 14. But, in actuality that detail came back to bite me in the ass. \n\nA week and a half. That\u2019s all it took, I didn\u2019t know how much she meant to me. But I loved that girl and it turned out she loved me. Partially the reason I was so numb to the feelings was I dated a psychotic girl I thought I loved for a year and 8 months before her. Jasmine. The bane of my existence. She was verbally, physically and psychologically abusive. But at that age, you don\u2019t know better, I was \u201cin love\u201d and getting laid. It made me feel superior to my peers. But it cost me so much grief.  \n\nMy first sin: I had been separated from Jasmine for a little while and I thought I could be friends just like all my other ex\u2019s I didn\u2019t see the problem what\u2019s done is done. Or so I thought, it hadn\u2019t occurred to me how manipulative and sly her feminine powers could be but week and a half in I find myself alone with her under a guise of a talk. At the time I apparently was blinded by hormones or blatant stupidity, or that I still loved her. Despite all the shitty things she did to me. She used her silver tongue and got it wrapped around my penis before I could think things through. Trying to justify it in my mind, I just let it happen. The irony is the clarity in release, the overwhelming dread, remorse and guilt of the first and only time I betrayed love.  \n\nThe next day, I ate myself alive and knew what I had to do. I remained distant and hid the words in my throat until we could be alone and didn\u2019t have any obligations. Walked to a corner outside the school building with walls on three sides and stood in the shadow of the sun partially shining in. I explained what I had done, how sorry I was didn\u2019t bother trying to make excuses. \n\nThe brief silence. How she began to cry, the image burned into my mind. Her slumping down the wall and covering her face to her knees yelling at me to go away. How she never wanted to speak to me again. As I walked away, I didn\u2019t know how much I ruined my own life. How I broke her heart. \n\n6-8 months of groveling, her lying to me, apologizing, agonizing, obsessing. Just to get to speaking terms. I can\u2019t even believe that\u2019s not the worst part. At least not for me.  The thing is all the instant messaging, trying to do things to be around her, texting, begging, explaining, hurting, sacrificing my pride. The pain, the anguish, the hurt, the heart break, the struggle the everything I haven\u2019t event explained yet. \nI\u2019d do it all again. Just for one more life time with her. \n\nIt\u2019s been over 2 years. My friends know the whole story, no one seems to care anymore. But I still miss her every single day. She\u2019s moved on and is happy with someone else. But I can\u2019t bring myself to love anyone else. Not like I loved her. She was everything good about me, she was everything to me. My life feels so empty without her. I\u2019ve learned to live with that reality. \n\nThis is a good place to stop typing on my phone, maybe I\u2019ll tell the rest sometime, maybe not.

I know there is a love/hate relationship with success stories here.

I'll try to keep it brief here.\nBasically the reason I was FA was because of severe depression, social anxiety, avoidant personality disorder, autism, and not being a good looking guy by any means. I struggled all my life with social interactions, doing well in school, making and keeping friends, or just being around people in general really. I obviously never interacted with girls ever and could count the number of friends I've ever had on one hand. So yeah, my self esteem is nonexistent. There's more I could go on with (like that I've never been able to get a job) but I said I would be brief, so that's that. \n\nI met my girlfriend here on Reddit. She has asperger's like me and she made a post that resonated with me, which I responded to in a private message. I can't really explain what happened because it's something I'm not used to, but we just clicked almost instantly. It felt like we were friends after just a few messages. That isn't something that happens to me at all, I'm terrible with people and barely feel like I'm a person myself most of the time. Shortly after that we began chatting together on discord, which became an every day thing. \n\nSo yeah. Fast forward 9 months to right now. She has flown from the UK to my home in the US to spend a week together. She's my best friend and the person I love more than any other. I can only really say that I'm lucky to have her. I didn't change anything about myself or do any of the self improvement BS that have become memes around here. I just lucked out in finding the one perfect person for me in the entire planet. \n\nI feel like I'm rambling at this point and realizing that this really doesn't matter to anyone so I'll just stop. But I do want to thank you guys for helping me through some of the lowest points of my life.

Apparently it's St. Patrick's Day tomorrow (which I wasn't aware of), but today there were a shit ton of young people (most of them in their late teens) partying at the city for a parade. A lot of them were returning home on the same train as me. Most of them were drunk, loud, and immature in their behavior, as typical with college age kids. I was one of the first to get on the train because I wanted to go home so badly, and not long after I sit down, several teens wearing douchey, green summer outfits and hats waltz right in. All of them were more than a little tipsy and freely shouting nonsensical garbage in the cabin. They sit in the booths surrounding mine, which normally isn't a problem, but once the train starts moving, they continue to yell and jump around with care. I was stuck with these obnoxious people for two hours. I had no choice but sit there and listen to their irritating conversations. The train was mostly full so I couldn't move to another part of the cabin, and I was too damn exhausted to move after a long day. Now how does this experience relate to this thread? Well, I'm a loner who's never had a relationship and very few friends. I wanted a peaceful trip home, but this ride was ridiculously shitty because of these drunks teens who wouldn't shut up and stay in their seats. They were frequently talking about each others' bodies and referencing sex and relationship drama. Oh, did I mention that all of them were pair up in couples? They talked a lot of shit about their other friends and kept regurgitating tasteless jokes left and right. The worst part was the couple sitting across from me in another booth (the train cabin is separated into 4 seat booths that face each other, I was alone in my own booth). The girl was sitting on top of the guy's lap and he was hugging and kissing her often. The part that really gets to me was when guy kept looking my way and staring at me. His eyes were narrow and abrasive with a smug smile on his face as if looking down on me. Even the girl looked at me the same way. I tried to ignore them, but the did it so often, and their friend's were so fucking obnoxious, that I responded with a glare of my own. I hated every single one of them. I hate people. I hate douchey college kids. Especially these kids. This was the worst train ride I've ever been on.\n\nTldr; Douchey young couples on a train annoy the fuck out of me all the way home.

I\u2019ve been stuck at home since, besides the times I\u2019ve had to go to the doctors, and the couple times a month my SO and I hang out with our few friends. \n\nAt first, I was so sick that I didn\u2019t care I was alone all the time. The company of debilitating pain kept me from wanting to be social. I just was focused on feeling better. Now I have some energy to socialize, still not able to work just yet (getting there), but every friend I have works or is too busy to talk/puts me on read and I\u2019m starting to lose track of days. If it weren\u2019t for taking my boyfriend to work and back during the week, I wouldn\u2019t know what day it was. We don\u2019t live with anyone else, and I\u2019ve got social anxiety around large groups of people so I don\u2019t bother going to anything remotely crowded by myself. I\u2019ve been sober for a year due to health reasons, which used to help my social anxiety in large crowds (anime conventions/bars). I\u2019ve tried making friends lately but nothing seems right. I feel like I walk on eggshells around new people I want to be friends with because I enjoy having new conversations. I feel like I bother people by asking questions or being upfront. I just miss talking with people who genuinely want me around, and have new experiences of my own. I miss bringing stories to the table at dinner. \n\nI worked in pest control for nearly two years, and had 3 very good roommates I consider friends still before I moved in with my SO. \n\nPest control is actually a really social job to do. Talking with new people everyday, helping them with problems, and besides crawling under houses and spraying for bugs, I touched many lives just by talking to people without judgement, held hands of crying customers because they were ashamed of their situation, and gave them my personal number in case something else arose after my job there was done. I didn\u2019t do pest control for the dirty work, I did it because helping people was so rewarding for me, no matter if some became a problem later or not. It was never something that couldn\u2019t be handled with a simple gentle let down. (Usually customers taking kindness as flirting.) I never let those things bother me unless they couldn\u2019t take no for an answer, which I haven\u2019t dealt with just yet. \n\nI still talk to my old roommates almost on a daily basis, but with being home alone for so long during the day, not able to leave the house much, and seeing everybody doing something, I really feel like crap when this feeling bubbles over. We all talk mostly over IM, but now it\u2019s just not the same. It hasn\u2019t been bad enough for me to cry about it until today. It\u2019s not like they\u2019re far from me, but not trusting my car\u2019s brakes and not having the money to fix up my broken vehicle or get a new one makes me feel isolated from the world unless I go somewhere with my SO.(I don\u2019t like driving other peoples vehicles for long unless I\u2019m on the insurance.) I barely have the physical energy to walk a mile outside without getting absolute fatigued for the next 24 hours. Living in a town where you need to drive everywhere, and especially near major roadways that I swear never sees a minute without someone whizzing by, doesn\u2019t help the feeling of isolation.\n\nI have the best man in the world, who cares for, loves me, and treats me like his queen and equal. He\u2019s able to work one job and take care of us and our cat without too many hiccups, and I do my best to tidy up our small one bedroom apartment so he doesn\u2019t have to worry about it when he gets home.

I am referring to the book in this reddit post [https://www.reddit.com/r/lonely/comments/1l1rom/has\\_anyone\\_read\\_this\\_book/](https://www.reddit.com/r/lonely/comments/1l1rom/has_anyone_read_this_book/)\n\n \"Loneliness: Human Nature and the Need for Social Connection\"  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf you are wondering if this book is a worthy read, I have inserted an excerpt below, taken from Chapter 10: Conflicted by nature. I just read up this part and I felt that I needed to share this with you guys. Warning: LONG read.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhen we feel lonely, we are painfully aware that our social needs are not being met; at the same time, we have a greater tendency to see ourselves as having little control over our ability to fulfill those needs. The prejudiced opinions of others always play a role in this negative feedback loop. If people expect a new acquaintance to be fun and nice, they will behave in a fashion that draws out the pleasant and enjoyable side of that new acquaintance. If parents or teachers think a child is intelligent, they will do and say things that will encourage that child to exercise her intelligence. In one study, participants were introduced to opposite-gender partners after being told that the person they were about to meet was either lonely or not lonely. They subsequently rated the partners they had been primed to consider lonely as less sociable than the others. They also behaved in a less sociable manner toward the partners they expected to be lonely.\n\nWhen our negative social expectations elicit behaviors from others that validate our fears, the experience makes us even more likely to behave in self-protective ways that spin the feedback loop further and faster toward even more isolation.\n\nSo while any of us may become lonely because of a genetic disposition coupled with an unfortunate situation, we remain lonely partly because of the manner in which we and others think. As the trap of loneliness becomes more a function of social expectations and aspirations, the literal reality recedes in importance.\n\nOne might expect that a lonely person, hungry to fulfill unmet social needs, would be very accepting of a new acquaintance, just as a famished person might take pleasure in food that was not perfectly prepared or her favorite item on the menu. However, when people feel lonely they are actually far less accepting of potential new friends than when they feel socially contented. Studies show that lonely undergraduates hold more negative perceptions of their roommates than do their nonlonely peers. This divide between the lonely and the nonlonely in their perceptions was even larger when the others being perceived were their suite mates, was larger still for floor mates, and was even more pronounced for students on other floors of their dormitories.\n\nTime also plays a role in constructing these negative \u201crealities.\u201d Researchers asked participants to interact with a friend, and immediately thereafter to rate the quality of the relationship and the quality of the communication. Participants then watched a videotape of the same social exchange and rated it again. A few weeks later the researchers reminded participants of their earlier exchange with their friend and asked them once again to rate the quality of interaction and communication. The participants watched the videotape once more and, once more, rated the interaction. At all four measurement points, lonely individuals rated relationship quality more negatively than did nonlonely individuals. But the further in time they were removed from the social exchange, the more negatively they rated it. They were especially negative after each viewing of the videotape. When they rated the interaction soon after it happened, it appears that their negative social cognition was reined in by their understanding of the reasons for their friend\u2019s behavior. As time went on and memory for the underlying subtext faded, however, the constraints faded as well. The more time that passed, the more objective reality succumbed to the \u201creality\u201d constructed by the lonely individual\u2019s negative social cognition. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf after reading this, you want the ebook, I am sharing mine on Drive.

However, I'd like to make a point about some negativity of the bad kind. Let me explain.\n\nEveryone here is frustrated. Everyone here has dark thoughts, feels rejected, and hates to be mocked by the \"try to shower\"-kind of advise. I totally get that. And I totally get that it helps to hear from others who feel the same way. I also get the negativity that stems from that kind of frustration, which is an understandable reaction.\n\nBut there is more, that toxic negativity, coming from a place of loathe and hate, which tries to keep you down, to keep you in this cycle of being lonely. Things like getting rated badly while looking decent. Or the negative responses when someone suggests a concrete solution in the comments, instead of the usual \"yeah, me too\". We are already at the bottom of the barrel, why do we need to hold us down, why don't we celebrate when one of us makes progress, why do we punish ourselves and the ones around us? Some people seem to be addicted to give this kind of response, and some seem to be addicted to hear it, I think as an excuse to \"just give up\".\n\nDon't get me wrong, this \"I just give up\" is a very natural reaction. But there is no need to glorify and reinforce it. Maybe you need to reach this point once, or twice, or forty-two times before moving on, but it is no state you can stay in for the rest of your life, it is a lie that won't work forever. I don't want to be responsible for someone not getting better, not taking a chance, not seeking help, not changing his live to the better, even if that means he leaves FA, and I have to stay.\n\nPersonally, I'm in the middle of a journey. This community helped me to see that something was not healthy about my behavior, and I'm thankful for that. I understand now that I'm unconsciously pushing people away (and why), and that I must overcome this to leave the ranks of FA. I can't say whether I'll succeed, but at least, for me there is a way, which is more than I ever had. And I hate the thought that others here might find their way, too, but lose hope because they are held back by unnecessary negativity.\n\nJust sayin'", "subreddit": "ForeverAlone"}

Went from failing high school to getting a 3.8 in college. Went from 270lb to 150lb. Went from having no friends to having no time to hang with everyone. Went from being jobless for 12 years and now making enough money to pay for everything myself. Gotten over some addictions.  \n \n  \nThis though? THIS is the most confusing thing in my entire life. Dating, intimacy, attraction, etc. Whatever you want to call it. Whatever I'm not doing right is something that's so deep within the way I live or who I am that I can't even look at it objectively.  \n  \nI think the hardest part is that I have no clue WHAT I'm doing wrong. Is it all just a numbers game? That could be true, but I just *know* that it's not just a numbers game for me. I've been rejected way more than successful and have been in enough situations to know that I'm also the issue. Even just statistically speaking. This shit feels like failing an exam but the teacher marks nothing wrong on the test.   \n  \nI honestly don't believe I'm ugly. I think there's something about me that's ugly, but I don't think it's my looks. I've gotten called cute/handsome before by girls. My guy friends sometimes have said that I'm a good looking dude. And honestly, when I just look in the mirror, I actually think I don't look too bad. I've seen guys with girls that seem out of their league. Guys who I think are around my level or seem a lot less attractive than their girl. Enough times where I've thought to myself \"it simply can't be just be all about looks\".   \n  \nI feel like I have a decent amount going for me in general. I work a wholesome job I'm really happy and passionate about, I have hobbies and skills, I have a lot of friends, and I sometimes just genuinely like myself and my outlook. I try to ask out girls and make stuff happen. Not as often as I could, but I still try. I'm not saying I deserve a girlfriend because I'm entitled to one or anything. I just feel like, man how is everyone around me except for me getting into 'lucky' situations so often? Don't I deserve some luck? If I roll a dice 100 times, I 'deserve' to roll a 1 at least once right? To be honest, I've had some minor success here and there, but you probably would too if you tried as often. So some parts about this are definitely a numbers game but I don't know what to do about the part that's not. I'm definitely not the most confident person ever. I have insecurities and whatnot, but damn, doesn't everyone? Everyone has flaws, struggles, and insecurities. But how are they finding love too?   \n  \nShould I be more aggressive or more patient? Should I imply things more subtly or state things more directly? Is it more attractive to show that you understand nuance or to be bold? Should I have showed intent to her after getting to know her more when the feelings get stronger, or should I have made it clear from the beginning to not make it weirder to pull away? Was that a sign that she liked me, or would her signs be WAY more obvious if she actually did like me? What if the problem is something else entirely that I can't see, as if it was like a proverbial piece of spinach in between my teeth. These are the types of questions I always have when some girl rejects me. I get flaked on quite a bit, rejected, lied to, etc. I've even had two girls flake on a date because of a death around them. I'm not saying that they're lying but damn what are the odds? How unlucky can I get? Even without any reasons, just getting ghosted on a lot. And hell, I don't even know what \"a lot\" really is. Maybe I'm not trying as much as some people do.  \n  \nI've gotten really close to a few girls throughout my life and two of them said they liked me back but the timing was wrong, but they continued to milk me for attention. Those events really flipped my head around on life and made me have to question and reassess quite a lot.     \n  \nI've tried changing things about myself. I've tried accepting things about myself. I've tried going more on gut and less on analyzing. And vice versa. I have no idea what to do to be more attractive. I'm shit scared of making women creeped out and scared (frankly I'd prefer to not bother anyone at all unless it's to defend myself) but there's a dichotomy where a lot of that same behavior is stuff that's attractive. I do believe I'm unique enough of a person where there are girls out there that could like me. Morally I think I'm fine. I'm no Mother Theresa, don't donate to charity, and I can have fucked up thoughts, but I've never purposely hurt someone and I'd much rather leave someone alone than drag them down. I also hold myself to a standard to not be like the people I hate, otherwise what was the point of learning hard lessons. But, I don't know, there's just nothing that makes any sense about this whole FA situation and, aside from literally hitting on girls 24/7, I'm trying whatever I can to increase my odds. Some of my friends are also not great with women but even they luck out sometimes. It just kills me too because I'm really sexual and also I just genuinely like girls and femininity and all that. I love being affectionate and playful and fun. But I just can't get anyone for me.    \n  \nThe problems I've identified in myself is that I take rejection personally, I make excuses to try as often out of anxiety, I care too much about how I come across, and I'm internally embarrassed/ashamed about my lack of dating experience and sexual performance. I feel like me trying so often has made me lose confidence in a different way. Imagine it like a bell curve. There's a middle height of confidence where you understand you're capable of asking out and hitting on girls and still have confidence to continue. I feel like I'm going passed the peak, of where I've gotten enough rejections from what seemed like good situations that I'm now so unsure of everything that I'm not confident in dating again. Part of me doesn't ever want to give up because I feel like I learn more about life by learning how to cope with failure and I also help troubled youth kids sometimes so it gives me more life experience to help. But I can't always be the support for everyone, I need support too. And this shit is just the most confusing, ongoing thing I've dealt with in my life.", "subreddit": "ForeverAlone"}

The group was originally started on a social network to find people from our neighborhood to hang out with, as a lot of people just live here and hang out in different parts of our city. The group at the moment consists of 4 women and 5 men (including me). It turns out they're all normies and it is bit confusing for me, so here are some observations I made just today:\n\n- I'm constantly getting notifications, as someone is always writing in the group. I'm not used to so many notifications\n- These people seem to have no filter, we barely know each other as the group was just started, but they write a lot about everything\n- There is no pattern to what people tend to write about, topics from today: good fast food places in our neighborhood, backpacks vs. handbags, tattoos, hair dyeing, tinder experiences (ego boost vs sex), hooking up in general, sex in general\n- It's apparantly extremely normal for these people to talk about their sex lives\n- Sexting is a thing (came up as a topic)\n- Hook-up culture is real, translated quoted from today \"Everyone needs a good sex relationship\"\n- Weekends without getting drunk are a waste to these people\n- Relationship drama is annoying and I'm happier than ever to be single\n\n**Update:**\n\n- New topic: exams, half of the group are students\n- It's almost midnight and for the first time since friday it is quiet.\n\n**Update:**\n\n- Why tinder is hard for women: \"you get 10 matches, 2 don't text first or don't respond, 4 start with 'hey, how are you', 3 send a dick pic, leaving one you might get along with\"\n- Another girl says she prefers a simple hi and is actually sick of guys responding to her bio.\n\n**Update:**\n\n- Nothing special today, just some talk about the weather in the morning\n- Some people are asking who is down for some beers in the evening\n\n**Update:**\n\n- New topic: flatmates, consensus is that women make worse flatemates than men\n- One of the girls seems to have borderline personality disorder or is just really emotionally instable\n- These people are boring, even more boring than me. We started the group to do stuff together and so far all they do is complain about their lives. The only one trying to start something was me and no one was interested.\n\n**Preliminary conclusion:** \n\nNormies care about a lot of pointless stuff, but in general they seem rather boring. Maybe the problem is, that they have other friends that they hang out with or that they're limited due to having a partner, but so far there were no mentions of something like this.

We we're friends (not really close, but close enough) for a while, but drifted apart in highschool. And now, she keeps moving forward with her life and with dating.\n\nThat's not what sucks though. What sucks is that she keeps popping up in your thoughts from time to time, and each time you realize that who she's with is truly great for her. They're a great couple, and you can't see how you could do any better for her. He's actually really nice, likeable, not douchy, and treats her right. And you haven't spoken to her since sophomore year in high school.\n\nShe owes me absolutely nothing... and I most certainly wouldn't consider myself to be one of those people that gets angry and complains that *\"these girls only date [these types] of guys, it's so unfair!\".*\n\nBut nevertheless, it's hard to get over it for some reason. She's living rent-free inside my head, and I need some way of evicting her.

Also, I hope I'm not seeming too whiny or depressed, I'm trying not to be, since this is obviously a first world problem.\n\nHollywood loves to show the \"love interest\" as dating a douchebag at first, finally ending with her dumping him and getting with the protagonist... but that's only one story of many...

I returned those pants at the mall, like I said I was going to do while I waited to hear from you. I picked out some cute clothes in case we decided to go to that party later. \n\nStill no call... it\u2019s a little past noon and I\u2019m hungry but maybe I\u2019ll wait, we can grab a bite together. I\u2019ll just keep shopping around the mall. \n\nFour hours later and I still haven\u2019t heard from you. I send a text, is everything ok??? \n\nOh, you had to do xyz for your kid and your parents. Ok. Guess I can\u2019t compete w family obligation... let me know when you\u2019re free! \n\nThree hours after that and the sun is going down on the day we were supposed to have together. I still hold out hope we can meet up but I\u2019m literally exhausted and broke from being at the mall all day. Did I mention I was waiting for you? That I was in your city to see you? That if I go home now I\u2019m not coming back out this way to see you tonight? \n\nSo, via text you apologize, if you\u2019d only known you\u2019d have to do xyz, you wouldn\u2019t have made plans...\n\n\n\nCool. Cool cool cool. \n\n\nSo I get home and try not to take it personally. And I pull out from the bag the cute lil top I bought for the party and the shoes to match... hang it up and put it away. I unwrap the necklace I bought and hang it on my hook. Oh, I forgot I DID get those earrings... those can go in the jewelry box, I have no need to wear them right now. Then I fold up the cute little nighty I hoped you might see after all these weeks of flirting and I put it in the back of my drawer cuz it\u2019s not something you wear when you\u2019re going to bed alone.

I only talked to a few people that I knew before I left the rowing team and only talked a little bit to everyone else. I didn't really know what to do. And yes there was drinking that night. I was talking to this one girl and she asked me if I wanted to see her piercings and I said no and continued to talk to her about lab stuff trying to get to know her and whatever but she grew uninterested in our conversation. I started talking to her after I saw a majority of the people there with their partners, of which I do not have one. Anyway, she became uninterested and, even if I wanted to talk to her more I couldn't because I had to help someone who was out cold and make sure they were ok (they were, I checked in this morning). Anyway, she started talking to the host and then it looked like they were going to hookup which they probably did. I being a gentleman decided it wasn't a good idea to do anything or try anything because people had been drinking. The point is that even though I was at a party with multiple people, I still felt an immense amount of loneliness and worthlessness. I drove home drunk and cried on the way home because of how I felt/acted. Also, back to me helping the person, o noticed that everyone was cheering on the other guy who helped him with me and not me. I'm not trying to be self-centered and take all the credit but it's still upsetting to feel like no one cared for what I did or that I was even there.\n\nWhoever made it down this far, good job and thanks for reading my sorrow!\n\nTLDR: Went to a party and didn't feel valued at all.

Since I get some nice social interaction on my pc.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBefore anything I would like to stress  that I am not generalizing all women, but a huge part of them act this way which is very heartless in my opinion and I feel bad for other guys, not really me since I don't try hard enough to complain anyways, I am sure there is a bunch of women who give preference to people who actually care about their feelings, and tbh I feel like a fucking shitty incel writing this, I just had to vent, sorry, I will definitely work on improving my mindset, but I had to get this off my chest. And deep down I know this is my fault, and I am just trying to make some crazy theory as an excuse for how pathetic I am so please despite going off on some women it is probably me who deserves to be criticized)\n\nSo I ended up in this channel  rsdfreetour where the guy gives lectures about becoming more confident and be better at picking up girls, I watched one of the lectures and it went fine, I agreed  with much of what he said, then I moved on to the next one, in this one at some point he started really stressing the fact that there are alpha and beta males, and how woman despise betas and will cheat on them if  necessary, and that it is our duty to become alphas if we want to date, and I don't know I think this is not 100% percent true but it is definitely a real thing some women do think like that, I think being a \"Beta\" or an \"Alpha\" is based a lot off your personality, being a beta should not be a flaw, what is the problem with being not too expansive, not liking getting into fights and choosing logic over feelings, and I feel really  hurt knowing I will have to shift my personality so someone will like me, and why should I do that? Why are women so especial and us so disposable , why do we have to change and not them, well I got kind of hung up on this concept and how women can be heartless to their partner and ditch him because she found some guy who is more of an \"Alpha\", maybe he does not treat her right, does not care as much, but who cares right? Why is it so unfair, we men who lack social skill have to through a pile of shit to improve ourselves and make the first move, for gods sake I sometimes I wish I could just fucking chop my balls off so I would stop caring so much about sex and be more rational, and focus on what really matter in life and improving myself, I sincerely am not trying to shame women, I believe there is some amazing women out there who would judge you for who you are and not for some fucking ridiculous  Beta/Alpha label, and honestly I still respect all people regardless, I hope I can bring myself together, and to think I got so fired  up  because of this lecture that was supposed to help me meet women.\n\n&amp;#x200B;", "subreddit": "ForeverAlone"}

I wanted a mysterious cloak to wear while presenting the videos so my brother put me in touch with a local cosplayer who does commissions via Facebook.\n\nThis cosplay girl is an absolute knockout. It has been so stressful messaging her. But on Friday she messaged me saying that she was home for spring break and wanted to know if I could stop by so she could get some measurements for the cloak.\n\nMy anxiety meter was pegged but I agreed anyway. \n\nI walked to her place Saturday morning. I arrived at her doorstep, rang the bell, and a very stern looking man answered the door. His expression of being angrily confused as to what I wanted has been causing me cringe flashbacks ever since. Fortunately, the girl came to the door before I choked on my anxiety and died on her doorstep. She took me up to her room and measured me. It was an incredible moment. \n\nShe had a sweet scent on her skin. As she moved her measuring tape around my shoulders and down my back, my heart melted. It was incredible feeling her delicate touch as she brushed against me. \n\nAfter the blissful moment, she took a step back, smiled, and said \u201cgreat, we\u2019re done.\u201d Due to my cringey nature, all I could do is smile back and say \u201cthank you\u201d while not sure of what to do next. She picked up on the awkwardness and invited me down to the kitchen to have something to drink before I headed home.  \n\nAs I walked home, I was swept with incredibly strong emotions that I\u2019m still struggling with now.\n\nTo have been so close to a beautiful girl was an awe inspiring experience. But I\u2019m absolutely crushed by the reality that I will never be able to call someone like her my girlfriend (or anyone, being more realistic). \n\nSome lucky guy will hold her in his arms. Some handsome man will sweep her off her feet. This person will buy her all the expensive things she deserves and they\u2019ll live happily ever after. \n\nEntertaining the idea that a young, attractive, cosplaying college girl would ever be interested in me has been suicide fuel in the truest sense. \n\nI feel like the universe is laughing at me...\n\nI almost want to ghost HER at this point. She said she would be finished the cloak around the end of the week so knowing I need to see her again feels like an open wound. (I won\u2019t ghost her though, I morally can\u2019t go AWOL after she has already started on the cloak.)\n\n**TL;DR** \n\nThrough commissioning a cosplay-esque cloak, I got to be in the personal bubble of a beautiful girl for a brief moment in time.

It's been that way for years, so I should be used to it, and all my failed attempts at socializing/trying to meet people (what with my anxiety and inability to keep in contact). But I'm kind of over it and in a way I wish I could stop knowing everyone from my past (aside from family), move to a diff state, and start over. \n\nEvery time bad things happen (guy randomly flaking on and telling me he's no longer attracted to me mid-week), my heart grows more black and I feel like isolating myself. So much of me just wants love from friends/good people and to return itt, but I feel like maybe I'm just meant to be alone? Idk.

I have always been insecure of my looks, especially since my first love (of 4 years) rejected me because of that. She went on to date one of my best friends who didn't give two fucks about her. For a good 2 years, I was depressed and as a result didn't score that well. Started smoking and eating bad shit. I stopped trusting my friends and would only interact with a select few. It has been a lot of time since that incident and things had been deteriorating for me. Until about last month or so, this random cute (Solid 8/10 and I'm like a 3 at best) chick texted me a meme. We got into a conversation and she turned to be really edgy and cool. We were deep into a conversation and out of the blue she says really nice shit like \"I get that you're an introvert and stuff but I'd really like to meet you\". Shocked, all I could reply was okay. Based on this comment of hers, I even invited her out to prom to which she even said yes. (Although due to the timing it didn't work out). We did meet later on. Smoked weed, tripped out and a mixture of awkward, sweet, funny moments occured here and there. When I reached home, she texted me saying lets meet again. I replied back sure.\n\nIssue\n\nI can't for the love of God hold a decent conversation with her. Being an insecure little bitch, im rechecking (and unsending) every text/meme i send her. I am so afraid of getting cucked that I am not entirely sure what to do now. I could meet her again, but I am not sure what to do, even if we do meet. I definitely like her, but I have a feeling inside I'm gonna get cucked. I asked her, about her ex she said something along the lines of \"I dont want to date again. At the beginning its too good but it takes too much work\". If she doesn't want to date good looking, cooler dudes, why would she date me? So I guess the question here is should I or should not pursue her? Because if I do and fail, I swear I might fall into an even worse depression. However, if I succeed, I might actually be happy for once in my life. \n\nTL;DR - Too insecure to pursue a girl. Please help.\n\nPS - I'm sorry if this post is too long. It's more or less my first reddit post ever. Also excuse me, if there's grammatical errors. English is not my first language. \n\nPlease Help. \n", "subreddit": "ForeverAlone"}

I\u2019ve done all you can do to try to meet new people, find new hobbies, try to enjoy my life as mine on my own, without a partner. Love yourself and someone will be drawn to you.\n\nMy 29th birthday is in one week and I have nothing planned because I just don\u2019t know how to celebrate it. I don\u2019t feel like sending a Facebook invite to a restaurant or bar. I know I should be grateful to have friends who care about me, but sometimes I want more. I\u2019ve always wanted to go on a romantic date or vacation for my birthday. Hell if someone I loved planned it for me as a surprise, or even just bought me flowers, I would fall apart in happy tears.\n\nYet I cannot have this. It\u2019s so fucking impossible to shift mind sets to believe it is possible to have this. I feel like I\u2019m calling out to God all the time and I\u2019m not a religious person. I would do anything to not think or feel this way, but I have tried my hardest to do this without any success. I feel defeated.

I have been having a really tough time the last two months with other things and I really could\u2019ve had someone to hug who cares and understands that some times life is hard. I don\u2019t wanna talk / text someone who isn\u2019t as available to me as they are to someone else. I\u2019ve been there for so many, only to have all the thanks be directed toward someone else. \n\nI find it impossible to give up hope or not think about / want love and companionship. I\u2019m always going to. This is never going to go away. It will always be on my mind no matter what I do to distract myself. I know if I met someone who things could really work with that I wouldn\u2019t be afraid. But it\u2019s so hard to attract someone at all, let alone someone you want as more than a friend, have them feel the same, and have it work out long term (some people lie and it takes time to see who they really are). \n\nThe only times I feel like I\u2019m not good enough are when I\u2019m rejected or ignored. But if I even Think someone might have a mutual attraction to me I\u2019m more confident and a happier person. I don\u2019t care what anyone thinks about that. I\u2019ve been alone long enough to know that there is a certain push that comes from being loved by someone else, and why people continue to find love even when they\u2019ve been hurt before.\n\nDear god, please help me.

Its weird, i can very easily and accidentally bring up the topic of sex with these girls like its a normal thing in both of our lives. they both talk about how the dont really like PIV sex that much and one of them said her boyfriend doesnt even return the favour of oral which is pretty fucked up imo. it kills me on the inside talking about it though, and understandably why. to both of them i am the stereotypical gay friend who gets a lot more personal and talks about more girly things with them unlike a straight man would. im pretty sure im not gay but i act like a gay friend to these girls. they know im not gay and one of them knows very well of my FAness but says being in a relo isnt that good just cause hers isnt that good and that being with someone isnt what life is all about, but it is at some point isnt it? i mentioned to the other that ive never had a gf but i doubt she knows to what extent.\n\ntheyve both told me about times theyve nearly broken up with them too and the things that they hate that they do. the problem is i see myself as the type of person who would be filling all their expectations, wishes. i think that i would genuinley be good at being in a relationship with someone. ive been told so about it i feel as if i really know the rights and wrongs of a relationship. ive just never had the chance. and i don't know how to get the chance . \n\ni know its bad for me but ive been holding onto the hope that if one of them break up with their boyfriends, after a while they might start to like me. its the only thing that really gives me hope in life atm. the unfortunate reality is by the time they would be ready to date again they probably would have found someone else, and i would just be that same old friend.\n\nthis turned into quite the rant and i veered off the original topic a fair bit and for that i apologise. idk it felt good to rant then. assuming youve made it this far, thank you for listening, good luck to you and god bless.", "subreddit": "ForeverAlone"}

She had some serious emotional baggage from past relationship and drama with old friends which, looking back, she probably took out on me.

I had plenty of chances with girls in college but I squandered them, as I had with other girls in the past.  Bad experience after bad experience caused me to stop trying and I probably got inside my own head at one point or another.  Been using marijuana on the daily to substitute the lack of intimacy in my life since end of first semester in college.

The day I give up is the day I kill myself and when I woke up this morning, I decided it wasn't today. I don't know about tomorrow or the day after that but today is not the day therefore I haven't given up. Dwelling on everything everyone says here doesn't help me and I need to stop looking. I refuse to be FA AND alive at the same time. I'm still gonna try despite everything I believe is holding me back. I'm going to keep trying until I kill myself. \n\nThank you for reading and acknowledging I exist. You don't know how much it means to me that someone was there to hear me make this dumb speech I thought sounded dramatic and profound.

However, I started a job at a new smaller company about a month ago, and my FA cover may is starting to be blown. At my previous companies, they were pretty large companies so it was easier to hide and just blend in the crowd. Also, I was able to find some people I connect with. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBut now at this smaller company, it is much more cliquey and less hierarchical (eg. staff at all levels talk openly, like senior analysts talk openly with directors and higher managers as their normal friends). This is not necessarily a bad thing in itself, however the topics they talk about relate almost majority to dating and SO's. Higher married managers complain about their SO's lol, while lower level employees get very personal about who they are dating and their personal lives.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nUsually at my old companies, I could play off I just want to live the single life and avoid more personal dating questions. However this company thats almost all they talk about and not really about other topics...., and since it is smaller, it is harder to just blend in with the crowd. Also, I have noticed since it is more cliquey, I can discern that performance reviews will most likely be based more on your likeability than technical abilities (more so than my past larger companies). This could be a determent to me as if I am not able to integrate, my career can now be affected by my FA status. I've trying to play it off as enjoying the single life, but employees constantly ask if I found new dates. And I notice they are sensing I am FA type... Not only in terms of dating, but normal having friends and social life too.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis also has shown me much more exposure to normies and some chads, maybe even more than college, and the vastly opened my lives to the different lifestyles we live. They go on multiple dates, hang out with friends every weekend, a much more gigantic social life than ours... at least mine.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNevertheless, the point of this post to avoid smaller companies if you are FA in my opinion, a larger corporate F500 company would be better as you can blend in and people in my experiences are less nosy in your personal lives. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTLDR: Your FA status can affect your career, especially in smaller cliquey companies. Recommend larger corporate type companies as they are easier to hide your FA status in my opinion. ", "subreddit": "ForeverAlone"}

Following the loss of hope and increased depression, I avoided any social interaction with my online friends for the past two weeks because I wasn't in the mood to share meymeys and play videogames and I wouldn't be able to make them laugh and be entertained as I usually would. Though they encouraged me to just let things go, and rightly so, I can't say I still feel any good because I don't want to go back to this \"normal\", lonely life. Avoiding social interaction, laying in bed almost all day everyday and staying offline instead of chatting and playing with online friends only got me to the point where I felt not just depression, but dead inside. I almost completely lost interest in videogames and other meaningful hobbies at home. Just not in the mood to do things in general...\n\nWith that out of the way, my Facebook feed has plenty of self-help videos and wisdom. They generally make some good points, however I can't help but facepalm and move on when I hear the same ol' \"**you have to love yourself first before you can be loved**\" and \"**you can be happy alone**\". That's just bullshit, if you ask me. Let's not count the fact that I've been alone all my life, have no real-life friends for whatever reason and as a 22 years old guy I'm still relying on the internet, but particularly these last two weeks I kept harming myself emotionally by avoiding online social interaction with the people I care for and that only made my situation even worse, even if I'm trying to be happy and feel even a bit of satisfaction.\n\nYou can have all hobbies you want (*I do and have reached a few goals, grateful for that but still not \"genuinely happy\" as a human being*) you can be rich as fuck, you can focus on yourself all day, it does not matter: our brains are naturally wired to seek interaction, support and togetherness from special ones (friends and SO). You cannot feel genuine happiness and you can barely be motivated to take risks and make sacrifices by avoiding your friends AND not having an SO to share things with, because you become miserable and demotivated. The \"love yourself first\" logic is awfully flawed for PLENTY of reasons, and this is one of them. Luckily there are plenty of articles online about how and why that logic is flawed and those make me feel a little better.\n\nAs much as y'all I wish I had an SO to share my life with, being in a relationship where both parties help each other every once in a while and do things together, also having friends that don't live very far away so we could meet much more frequently in person. But, as these self-help videos and books say, I don't \"love\" myself so that means I do not deserve to be loved by a SO and get support/social interaction from friends because I'm an alien who's able to reach a non-existent finish line in happiness and self-discovery soon enough where life suddenly becomes all sunshine and rainbows.

But after school, I could always come home and laugh my ass off with my online friends. I knew some of them for over 6-7 years, and made a lot of great memories with them.  I had my energetic drive/spark online that I could never translate to real life.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAt the end of my sophomore year I transferred to an alternative high-school, and my real life completely changed. For some reason everyone liked me. I met my closest friends there, I was hanging out with my group of friends outside of school almost every day. Since there were only 40 kids in the school, we were all really close. We tried pot together (we were clueless and that period was really fun and stupid), we went to a few parties, I lost 90 pounds working at an express gym with my teacher, and I helped my friend lose 60 lbs too. When graduating I decided I wanted to become a personal trainer, and my best friends dad hooked me up with a job shadow.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhen I graduated I had my first extremely short fling with a girl, and I realized how awkward I really was. I didn't let that failure get me down though  and would still drive around with my friends. Until my mom got sick. She has extremely bad bipolar disorder. When she got sick, I needed to take care of her (My dad left when I was real young). She would do things like open the window and scream for someone to call the police, it was real embarrassing. So I stopped talking to my friends. That laster for about a year...\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIn that time I honestly forgot about talking to my online friends. I was spending so much time managing the house, planning with my moms case manager, that I didn't realize how much time had passed. My mom ended up totaling my car right before she got better, and I didn't have the energy at that point to try reconnecting with my real friends. So I just sat in my house for about 3 more months.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow I've effectively been a hermit for a year and a half. When I try to talk to my real life friends, they say things like \"Don't kill yourself!\" jokingly, or express how I'm a different person now. I don't have any of the spark/drive that I used to. Even when I try to talk to my online friends, I have crazy social anxiety. I can maybe talk to one, but only because he's just as awkward as I am.

Maybe some of you can relate?\n\nSo I am entering the last year of my 20s on Saturday.\n\nIt's been a doozy of a decade.\n\nI lost all my friends. I used to have so many. I never realized how many I had until they were gone. At some point I must have been likeable. I must have trusted and been able to maintain connections. I don't know what happened to me.\n\nIt's a lot easier to gain perspective when you aren't not in the moment.\n\nI am finally starting to understand why building a relationship with yourself is so important and how only then can you protect yourself emotionally.\n\nI am currently on a solo trip. I am staying at a really awesome hostel with great people. I conversate with them and get my fill of human interaction but I still feel like an alien. I feel like an alien everywhere I go. Though I love traveling and it is my life source, I always inevitably feel a sense of loneliness.\n\nI am simultaneously in a state of bliss because I am exploring a new place but at the same time a state of sadness because I am reminded how much I am utterly lacking in human connection.\n\nI just feel like I was made to be alone.\n\nI am an INFJ. I don't know if that means anything to anyone but basically I am really intuitive. I am dreamy, complex, hard to understand. I am in my head. Been told I am \"too intense\" \"too sensitive\". I constantly contemplate the nature of reality, consciousness, the cosmos, what life is, what I am, what people are, what we are doing here and where we are going after here. I fail at small talk and superficial interaction. I either go deep or go home. Which usually means I get bored with the interaction.\n\nAnd for this reason, I don't connect. I don't feel like anyone truly understands me and I think people find me too intense to want to spend any amount of time around me. Sometimes I don't even have to do anything. I can just be trying to be as simple and normal as possible and ask them about their life. Be interested. Keep it basic.

When I didn't have somebody I had friends and people I could lean on but over the last year I've lost everybody. Either due to my actions or their own. I already have enough abandonment issues and trust problems  due to my biological paretns every guy knows my life story and still treats me the same.I havnt had insurance for a couple yrs so I havnt been able to/want to see a therapist. The idea of having someone be paid to listen to me kinda makes me sader. Basically self diagnosed with depression and anxiety tho. So years and days are better than others but for about 3 years it has just been too much. Everyone around me  is so fake and just want to use people for a ride, or to smoke, or borrow $.  I have been in bout 10+ relationships but I've had a handful of them  come into my life and promise me forever, no matter what, all the same b.s. they all say and possibly mean at the time but they dont mean it forever, one even purposed.  apparently forever means no more than 3 years. After spending the last 6 months trying to make it work with someone who promised forever(more convincing than anyone before) loves me so much but they can't be with me anymore because of the pain they caused me... if I didn't have my mom I would have already spiraled down a deep hole and hopefully never come out. I don't start work for another two weeks so I sit here everyday alone, no one texts me, no one messages me, no one cares. I'm not perfect and I don't expect the world but I care and love deeply and I make sure I show it regularly but I guess I have my own problems are too much for them. I dont need a man to be happy but I just want to feel important to someone in this world. I'm a nice,  genuine, thoughtful, intelligent, social butterfly  who just wants to make other people happy, and help them anyway I can.  I cant remember the last time someone really cared about what I was going through (other than my mom) Sometimes she's not as much help as she thinks, but that's how moms are. I have \"friends\" and by friends I mean guys that will talk to me cuz they think they can get in my pants. Not bout that at all.. I have been told many time I have have fairytale version of what i think love is and it doesnt exist, I don't expect perfect, just a 2 people who r equally invested in each other through the good and the bad. \n      A lot to say with no one to genuinely listen.

I feel like it\u2019s one of the main reasons that keeps me from having relationships. Thankfully I worked hard to learn how to make friends and now I have very close friends who I can trust. But still, I keep my distance. I don\u2019t think I have anyone who I can 100% trust or feel like I can fully depend on. I feel like I would be a burden if I try to depend on them every time I\u2019m having my lows. I fantasize about finding a lover who I can trust and depend on completely. But I haven\u2019t found anyone. Sometimes I get attached too fast to people who (1) are very nice to me, (2) seem like they are interested in me, or (3) have a lot in common, and I kind of get too excited and pour my affection hoping that things will escalate into a relationship cuz I\u2019m sick and tired of waiting. But even when I\u2019m \u201cpouring\u201d my affection I don\u2019t actually tell them that I like them cuz I\u2019m scared that my feelings will scare them away. I just send them a lot of texts, be very very nice to them, want to hang out all the time etc without actually talking about my feelings. Usually I get friend zoned or slowly fall apart. (Idk I thought it would\u2019ve worked cuz I\u2019m a girl, but maybe it\u2019s because I\u2019m ugly) Once I realize that they might not reciprocate the feelings (like if they like someone else or their reaction is not enthusiastic) I just shut my feelings. But I will leave some space if they ever want to come back to me. So I\u2019m just always in constant agony/chaos wandering if this person likes me or not. I don\u2019t want to admit that I like someone until I know they like me for sure. I don\u2019t know I\u2019m very scared and I just want someone to fight for me and take me out of my bubble but I guess I\u2019m not special. I really want to learn how to fix myself and I\u2019m planning to go to therapy but I\u2019ve been struggling with this my whole life and I\u2019m so exhausted. Did anyone have the same issue as me?

She's home for spring break and in the process of assembling said cloak. More context can be found in the link above.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**What's Happened**\n\nOver the past few days we have been communicating regularly through Facebook messenger. At first she was just giving me updates on her progress on the cloak but it evolved into a full conversation. She'd ask how my day was going, talk about anime, she even brought up the fact that she's not interested in other guys at college.\n\nWhile my heart has been going crazy I have been telling myself not to read anything into this. However my frustration on the matter peaked today when she sent me a \"Good Morning\" message.\n\nI hate myself for not being able to interact with a female without falling madly in love. Honestly, I also hate the fact that she's beautiful, putting her way out of my league even if there was a sliver of hope for me to ever get a girlfriend.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**What I Want To Do**\n\nI want to straight up ask her if there could ever be anything more between us. I know I shouldn't be \"that guy\" but this situation is driving me nuts. I would prefer rejection than to continue on this way.\n\nDoes anyone have any thoughts on whether I should do it or not?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\--\n\n**Update**\n\nI asked. I decided to be very direct to avoid friend-zoning responses.\n\nWhat I said: *\u201cHey \\[redacted name\\], I\u2019ve truly enjoyed talking to you and I\u2019m really happy you\u2019ve come into my life. However there is something I need to be honest about. I think I\u2019ve fallen for you. We\u2019ve only known each other for a brief moment in time but we\u2019ve hit it off so well. I\u2019m sorry to be so direct but I want to make you mine.\u201d*\n\nYou already know her reply\u2026\n\nShe said she didn\u2019t think we should talk about this through text. As she\u2019s nearly finished the commission she set up a time to meet at a Starbucks. She said we could sort things out then.\n\nI\u2019ve already been to her house for a measuring, for added context. Setting up a meeting in a public place is an obvious step backwards.\n\nAt this point I regret commissioning the cloak that put me in this situation, but I don\u2019t regret my actions since. This hurts but at least I know that I didn\u2019t let anything slip away.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Update 2**\n\nA couple hours have passed. She's sent me an update photo of the cloak and resumed some of the small talk. It seems like she's taken the route of pretending that my previous message never happened. I'm glad that I didn't scare her to the point of her ghosting me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Update 3**\n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/ForeverAlone/comments/b46g02/somethings\\_happened/](https://www.reddit.com/r/ForeverAlone/comments/b46g02/somethings_happened/)", "subreddit": "ForeverAlone"}

Mainly, I am extremely lonely and depressed. I am 20 yrs old, in CC right now (will be transferring to uni next year) and have some stuff going on that are interfering with daily life. First, I have always had a hard time making friends, I am extremely introverted. The one friend I had became frustrated with me that I wasn't contacting him enough and when I told him that I had in real life stuff going on and it was hard to talk to people about these things, he sent me a barrage of texts saying a lot of hurtful things one of which included \"You're emotionally fucked up kid, fix yourself\". We haven't spoken for a month and a half now and its become difficult to talk to him after this, he is also pretty high maintenance.  Along with this, I have social anxiety (and anxiety in general) so it's very difficult for me to initiate conversation with people. I get along pretty well with my coworkers and enjoy being around them, but many of them always hang out with each other when not working and I feel sad that I am never invited along. I always tell myself that sometime I'll ask them if I can come along, but have not been able to get to it. Secondly, I have a crush on a beautiful and amazing girl at work. However, she has a boyfriend who also works there and their relationship is very stable and happy. I am happy for her, and I would never try and sabotage the relationship, but I have feeling for her that I have little to no control over and these thoughts are very difficult to control during the day whether or not I see her. These thoughts and feelings are starting to interfere with everyday life and makes it difficult to focus on work and hw. Last night I ended up crying into my pillow.  I'm not sure what to do about these things and I don't know how to get rid of these feelings. Similar experiences? What steps did any of you take?

We both came early to school basically every day so we started hanging out before class, just chatting about whatever. At first it was super awkward but we quickly grew closer and became good friends. We used to chat at night using Kik and we had some stuff in common, mainly the type of movies we liked. One day I realised I really liked her and that was probably the first time I was really in love. I was pretty self aware and I knew that I wouldn't try to push it too hard if she didn't respond to my signals.  \nSo I started trying to get it across to her and pretty soon she started to catch on and respond. For some reason I couldn't just say it out loud, no matter how hard I tried. When I was finally starting to get to a point where I was comfortable telling her how I felt she started avoiding me out of nowhere and hanging out with some of the more popular girls in her class. Pretty soon after that I found out she had started dating my best friend, with whom I had also started to glide apart.  \nWe didn't speak for about 3 or 4 years and I met her again for the first time a few months ago and she didn't seem to remember me at all, I hadn't been thinking much about her since then but when I saw her I immediately remembered everything and tried to talk to her but she seemed genuinely confused.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThere was another girl I had been friends with when we were very young but when we reached higher grades we stopped talking and I didn't think much of it. When we got older we ended up in the same class and started talking again, mostly because my best friend was dating her best friend and we were kind of forced to hang out because of that. We became friends again and started hanging out and talking inbetween classes. By our last semester I was sure I liked her and I didn't want to fuck it up this time. I started giving pretty clear signals, not in an aggressive way or anything. She obviously didn't mind and carefully started confirming my signals. However I was very unsure about what was going on and how to tell her how I felt, especially since we were basically never alone. My friends were probably onto me and every time someone mentioned it we would just laugh it off, but I would feel really shit and it kind of looked like the girl felt the same way but I was never sure and I didn't know how or when to adress it.  \nNow we share a german class and even though we ocassionally talk she seems to have shrugged it off and moved on, I didn't want to do the same thing but it seems like I have anyways.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nObviously problems talking to people you like is extremely common but I would just want to know if someone has some good tips for not being a pussy other than \"just do it\" or \"just tell her what you feel\".

I\u2019m a girl, but I\u2019d say 80% of the people who have shown interest in me were also girls (I\u2019m bisexual, so that\u2019s okay) but no one ever actually wanted to go any further than just having a crush on me. I\u2019ve had a very small amount of guys interested but they\u2019d just talk to me for a while and move on. Probably to a girl that has less emotional baggage and actually looks decent. I just think I have next to no chance of anyone ever wanting to be with me, and I feel so lonely.", "subreddit": "ForeverAlone"}

What kind of a partner would make me happy? These are questions that have seemed almost impossible for me to answer for pretty much my entire life. I've made a lot of attempts to find out using the methods most available these days (For example, a lot of internet dating) and I think only recently have I come close to a reasonable answer.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI don't expect many to get much out of reading this, but it's not something I think is necessarily personal to me, I think this could apply to many other people as well. Additionally, **some of this may be obvious to you**, however it was not to me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThere are so many things to judge other people on, and to find someone who satisfies all of your conditions for the perfect person is unreasonable. For many, physical appearance is an important factor, also personality, sense of humor, the list goes on. How do you prioritize these things though? I'm 5'10 and attracted mainly to women shorter than me, but I also highly value a sense of humor. What if I meet someone who's 6'0 but has an amazing sense of humor? What's more important? (These questions about specific people are quite often solved by whether or not they want anything to do with you and not the other way around, but it's pointless to try to predict that).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt's freeing to leave it up to your subconscious and hope that you develop a chemical attraction to someone, AKA love, so that you don't have to really think about it, but I find that's often a risky option and is less available the older you get. Everyone seems to have a different definition of love and crush and infatuation and the difference between being in love versus loving, so it's mostly pointless to bring up here anyway because we probably wouldn't all be talking about the same thing anyway.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI've done a lot of internet dating. I'm not the most prized catch so my options have been somewhat limited, nevertheless I have been on a lot of dates. I've tried dating people I was physically attracted to and hoped I would grow to like their personality. I've tried dating people with whom I had a lot in common while hoping I'd start to find them attractive the better I knew them. Neither of these approaches led to successful long term relationships. Internet dating, in my opinion, is a handicap anyway because it's way better to have time to figure out whether you want to date someone before you start going on dates. This isn't the point of this post, but if you don't already try to form a friendship with someone before thinking about dating, I recommend it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhat I've discovered is that the area of focus that works the best when searching for a partner is intellectual and moral compatibility. This may not be true for everyone, but if not I think there are some good ways to help define what this is for you. If you're talking to someone and find yourself thinking \"Oh my god, I thought I was the only one who thought X\" (Slight exaggeration but you get the idea), pay attention to what that thing was and how it made you feel hearing that in that moment. It may help you define the compatibility that is most important to you. You could choose to define that as emotional compatibility, but if I just said \"Emotional compatibility is important\" with no explanation people would be right to say \"no shit.\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**I could be completely wrong**, but these are the imperfect observations I've made within my experiences.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTL;DR - OP spends a long time theorizing that the most important types of compatibility may be intellectual and moral compatibility. Example: You should find yourself thinking/saying something like \"I thought I was the only one who thought/felt X about Y!\" The unwritten suggestion being that focusing on finding someone who meets that criterion, with less emphasis on things like physical attraction, may lead to more fulfilling relationships / a relationship at all.", "subreddit": "lonely"}

For now maybe.", "author": "ifarted70", "self_text": "Tl;dr: I was watching I think Techlinked and one of their stories was about how Tinder is planning on changing their internal ranking system to activity based, not attractiveness based. Source at bottom\n\nBasically, the way it works now is the more people who swipe right on you, the more often you show up in other peoples' feeds and sooner I assume. Which makes total sense. Anyone here who still tries tinder regularly will probably admit that they can go months without matches, but then one day you match with a bot or a scammer or something. Then maybe another one a few days later, etc because your profile got a small boost from it. This happens to me. I'll swipe too fast and accidentally swipe right on a trans person with no boundaries, or just get someone from the Phillipines even though my range is set to 40 miles max and then I'll get another one or two over the course of a week, then literally nothing for three months. \n\nAnyway, they're supposedly changing this over to be activity based. That way the more you use the app, the higher up you are rather than the attractive people attracting even more attention. I don't want to sound overly enthusiastic but for some of this we might actually be able to get something for once. Might just be a conversation here and there. But that's better than nothing at all right?\n\nEdit: found the source! https://www.engadget.com/2019/03/18/tinder-dumps-desirability-scores/", "subreddit": "ForeverAlone"}

(Also venting)", "author": "[deleted]", "self_text": "I've only heard good things about therapy and I feel like I'm getting close to the edge.  \nI used to have a friend I rarely talked to but about a year ago we started getting really close and I learned we actually shared a shit ton of interests and it was refreshing how open he was about his life and feelings. I think he is one of maybe two people I have ever really trusted. We would chat all night long, just about anything. We could talk for hours about our secrets, our feelings and our most secret interests. Which was quite nice since most of my other friends were kind of hard to hold a long and meaningful conversation with because they are the kind of guys that have a hard time expressing their emotions.  \nAbout 6 months ago my friend met a girl online, they started talking and found out they had a lot of common as well, the same interests, about the same age, they both lived in the same country. So one day he introduces me and my other friends to her and besides me she didn't really seem to like any of them. So she, my friend and I would sit up for hours at night just chatting about whatever and that's when I really allowed myself to feel real emotions for the first time and even though my self reflection got me really sad at first I quickly started getting better since I had them to talk to.  \nOne night she sends me a message telling me she has to talk to me immediately. I was trying to sleep but I didn't really mind talking to her so I responded. She confessed to me she was in love with my friend and didn't know what to do. This had been pretty obvious and I was just kind of waiting for one of them to say and I were of course very happy for her. She dealt with a lot of depression and anxiety but I helped her build up the courage to tell him and soon after that they pretty much \"officially\" dating. They invited me along for a trip were we would all meet for the first time and obviously I felt like a bit of a third wheel but it was fine since I trusted them.  \nWhen we all met however they kind of started being assholes towards me and being really inconciderate about me feeling down at the time. I knew they were both the type of people to get pretty stressed by this kind of situation so I just left them alone when they wanted to be left alone and hung out with them to the best of my ability.  \nThey started talking to eachother by themselves for a while after that and I didn't mind since I were busy with school and they were just newly dating and everything. We still talked every now and then and were still friends. Eventually they just kind of stopped talking to me and I've only talked to my friend a few times since then.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI know you shouldn't rely on your friends too much and I've defintely felt that. They were the only people I could talk to about this stuff and now that I've \"lost\" them it feels really shitty. I didn't notice it that much at first but it has really affected me. I think they have both kind of moved on from me in a sense and going back to them now would only seem like I am finally talking to them again because I need something.  \nSo to finally get to the point, is therapy worth my time? I am feeling really garbage and I NEED someone to talk to but to me therapy just seems really weird, like I'm talking to someone that doesn't really care about me and the only reason they listen to me is because their job is to pretend like they care.  I've done a lot of self reflecting and at this point I think I might need a professional to find out why I feel the way I do.

I don't know why I saved it because there was nothing particularly interested in it except us talking and my terrible flirting attempts with her play flirting back. I mentioned a crush I had on another woman I had just started talking to. At that point I didn't know I was falling for my oneitis. I was either 22 or 23 at the time. It was interesting how despite being only 20 or 21, she was a 20 or 21 year old woman talking to a guy who might as well have been 14. I was awful at flirting. Wow, I was terrible. \n\nI know my flirting hasn't improved much but if this was me trying to flirt in my early 20's, no wonder why I failed back then despite constantly being at the gym improving what I could with things I could do something about like getting into better shape. This was when I honestly believed I was going to meet someone. My self-esteem was much higher and you wouldn't even recognize the me when I was in my early 20's. Yes, sometimes I would be depressed since I had failed out of college and was still a virgin but I was convinced I could find a woman who would like me. I also constantly went out and tried to talk to people in public. Usually I just weirded or creeped them out. I didn't flirt with people in public but I did flirt with women online. I always thought the main reason I failed in my early to mid 20's was my being ugly was too much to overcome but my trying to talk to women was more normal for someone 10 years younger trying to talk to a girl he liked at lunch in school. \n\nThis is what FA does to you. It causes you to fall so far behind with things that other people did 10 years earlier like flirting, even if you are able to start, it's so late that you will come off terrible. No wonder why her and other women picked other guys over me. Even if you ignored my looks and low social status, if you are a woman in your early to mid 20's that was single that had a few guys interested in you, you aren't going to pick the one who sounds like a 14 year old flirting. \n\nI know some people will think me having an old chat log as being creepy but honestly I don't remember even making it and like I said, there was nothing in the chat that I would want to save. I badly flirted with my oneitis for a couple of years. This was towards the beginning. I mentioned the crush on another woman who actually was already in a relationship who I did become friends with to the point we would hang out including sometimes even the boyfriend who was extremely nice. I remember thinking how great of a couple they were. My downfall was introducing her to a friend of mine since they lived near each other. They quickly became best friends. Both of them eventually ghosted on me. We would hang out but it became less and less common until they hung out together without me. They are probably still best friends but I haven't talked to either for over 10 years. I know they aren't together because he was gay. Both were extremely intelligent and probably are happy. \n\nWhen I read that chat it hurt not just reading the bad flirting but knowing that these people became normal adults while I never actually became an adult.

It's not painful or makes me feel sad or anything but it is kind of bothersome, like the contents of my mind and heart has been carved out with a spoon and filled with fog. I've spent almost my entire life trying to make friends and the results were not good. Either the relationship/friendship dies or the person decides to leave for reasons unknown and I'm the one left devastated for a while and the other person moves on immediately. \n\nI've spent nearly a decade being depressed because I was lonely and it hurt. I was begging for the longest time for the pain to go away and when it finally did but I didn't really feel much of anything afterwards. I was far from depressed but not quite happy either but close enough. I didn't really want any relationships/friendships at that point but I didn't say no if someone wanted to be involved with me for some reason.\n\nI took a break from a toxic relationship that I ended and decided I couldn't really keep any type of relationship going at this point so I ended all my relationships and stopped talking to people I used to talk to, we weren't close or anything.\n\nI didn't use discord for a long time and someone I haven't spoken to in a while messaged me saying he missed me and stuff so I decided not to be rude/ignore him and talk to him. We couldn't even talk regularly for two days until he decided to blow me off to play Devil May Cry 5. I keep up with game news and knew it was a very anticipated game for a lot of people but I haven't spoken to the person in over 6 months. Like it made me question why I even came back to discord in the first place if I have to beg for a response/ a little attention while he binge plays the game from the afternoon til sunrise the next day. I just don't bother trying to talk to him anymore cause it's not worth it if he's just going to blow me off everytime a game he likes comes out.\n\nI have came to the conclusion that there just isn't any satisfaction in any relationship to be found. I just can't try to be social anymore. It's just so drab and unsatisfying I don't have it mentally and emotionally to keep trying. Like what's the point? I know someone's gonna be like \"Don't give up, there's someone for everybody.\" I doubt it and if it is true how likely is it to meet such a person huh? 0? .1%? Is that really the odds you want to put faith in? Often hope is not rational, which is why people continue to play the lottery. I don't want to play lotto anymore cause at the worst you get nothing and at the best you get something that doesn't last long. The chance of getting the \"grand prize\" that'll last a while at least is slim to none and I don't have it in me to commit anymore of my time. Just about everyone I come across is unremarkedly similar and the few times I find someone different the relationship is brief.  I'm different than most people and it's terrible. I know I can be interesting and fun to talk to but it seems I'll never get to show anybody that. I went from reasonable expectations to no expectations and still found myself disappointed.\n\nI just don't know what this feeling is. I'm not sad or angry at anybody and I still enjoy my hobbies. It's just sometimes this weird feeling comes and doesn't go away til later or the next day.\n\nI am a tiny bit concerned what may happen to my brain if I go cold turkey forever and never really try to talk to anybody again. I know being social is a survival instinct in my brain and I don't want any long-term issues to occur because of that.", "subreddit": "lonely"}

Here's a quick recap of what's happened so far:\n\n \n\n**\u201cI was in a cute girl\u2019s personal space for a brief moment in time\u2026now I want to die.\u201d**\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/ForeverAlone/comments/b2dn3k/i\\_was\\_in\\_a\\_cute\\_girls\\_personal\\_space\\_for\\_a\\_brief/\n\n**TL;DR** I commissioned a cloak from a local cosplayer who\u2019s on spring break. I was briefly in her presence while she took my measurements at her place. I walked away feeling emotionally crushed for being so close to someone so beautiful and realizing that I am destined to be forever alone.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**\u201cShould I straight up ask if there could ever be something between us?\u201d**\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/ForeverAlone/comments/b3ee9y/should\\_i\\_straight\\_up\\_ask\\_if\\_there\\_could\\_ever\\_be/\n\n**TL;DR** Throughout the week we had been communicating through Facebook messenger. At first she was giving me updates on the cloak\u2019s progress but it evolved into a full conversation. \n\nA few of her messages seemed to hint she might have some interest in me. I decided to be direct and (cringily) confessed my feelings to her. Her response was that she didn\u2019t want to talk about it over text. She set up a time for me to pick up my cloak and \u201csort things out\u201d.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**What Happened This Morning**\n\nWe agreed to meet at Starbucks for me to give her the second half of the payment for the commission and to receive the final product. I thought I would be meeting her inside but before I went in she called out to me from her car. As I walked up she motioned for me to get in the passenger side. \n\nI sat down, I pulled out my wallet and gave her the second half of the money. The cloak was in a bag on her lap. She passed both the money and the cloak back to me. She said that what she really wanted was to talk about was what happened on Wednesday. \n\nShe said that my brother had told her about me in detail when he initially set up the commission. (He was the one who put me in touch with her.) She said, \u201cI was happy that you messaged me your feelings. I feel the same way about you. If you\u2019re willing to wait 6 weeks for me to finish school, I\u2019m yours.\u201d\n\nI was (and still am) absolutely floored. \n\nOf course me being my dense self I had to clarify if that meant we were dating or if I had to wait the 6 weeks and she said that no, assuming I was on board, we are dating.\n\nWe got some lattes from the drive through and stayed in the parking lot for a while. I reaffirmed that we were really dating. I also made sure my life situation was absolutely clear to her. She said it didn\u2019t matter as long as I was willing to take the steps in the right direction. \n\nShe drove me home and when I got out she got out as well and gave me a hug. This is the FIRST TIME in my life that I have been hugged by a non-family member. It was an incredible moment.\n\nI cannot believe I\u2019m saying this but here I am. No longer forever alone.\n\nI feel like there is so much more to say. So many extra details, thoughts, realizations, etc. Initially she was going to head back to her college residence Saturday morning but right now she\u2019s trying to push it back until Sunday so we can have some time together.", "subreddit": "ForeverAlone"}

Stop chasing anything. Think about it, you've be trying for a long time, and what good has come out of it? None. Just rejection, disappointment and hopelessness. Do something different from what you've been doing all this time and just give up.\nAnd I do think mean a negative kind of giving up where you just give up because you feel defeated. I mean the kind of giving up that comes from insight and the realisation that you are alone and trying to change that only causes you pain. Give up on the idea of finding \"love\". What we call love isn't even love anyway because it's so quick to turn into hate. Most people don't have love, they don't even know what it is, even though they throw the word around alot.\n\nYou might say \"well, if I give up then things will never change\" but assuming you haven't given up yet, have things changed? Are you happier from all the effort you put in? If not then maybe take a different approach; accept your loneliness. Don't run away from it, don't distract yourself. Face that loneliness, be one with it. Really. The next time you feel really lonely, don't do anything about it. Don't watch tv, don't go on your phone, don't distract yourself. Just sit with that feeling of loneliness. Just observe it, you'll see that it comes and goes.\n\nThe more you do this, loneliness begins to turn into *aloneness*, which is a completely different thing. Giving all your attention to loneliness transforms it. I know this because I've done it.\n\nSo stop trying, give up and accept the fact that you're alone.

There are memes on FB like \"If I treat you like shit you should know why that's why you're my boyfriend \\*kissy face\\*\\*hearts\\*\\*cry-laughemoji\\* #gfproblems #iamgoalslol\" and APPARENTLY still have someone to put up with it. When I was pregnant, I was comparatively well-behaved - no crazy cravings and making my ex husband run out and get me food at 3 AM, no complications, I could be a little cross when exhausted, but I've HEARD STORIES of how women can be while pregnant and I did my absolute best not to be that way. But still when he talks about the pregnancy it \"Oh yeah, you did NOT enjoy that lololol you were miserable.\" It was SUCH A FUNNY JOKE.\n\nMy family just hates any negative emotion I have, if I get upset, they look at me like slime dripping off their arm, like my mood is going to get on them and make them just as unappealing as I am. My stepsisters both live across the country and my dad and stepmom probably visit them four times a year conservatively. Like fly out there to see them. But my apartment across town is \"too far to come visit\". They have a cabin in another state that they bought five years ago and both my stepsisters, their kids, and their husbands have all spent weekends there. But I only ever got to see it because my CAR broke down on a business trip in that state and they just happened to be at their cabin nearby and came to get me. Then they got MAD at me for being upset about my car and sulking on the trip home. They YELLED at me. My stepsisters could have had a crying meltdown and they would have like - bought them a new fucking wallet or something. But I just LOST MY CAR that I paid for IN CASH with my tax return, after SIX MONTHS of taking the bus and they were MAD AT ME FOR BEING UPSET. Showing up at family events when my 5-year-old daughter is with her dad is like \"Oh...hi...is it just you?\" Thank God my daughter is apparently immune to their apathy.\n\nAt work, there are people we work with that have flat-out called me stupid after months of abusing the office staff to the point where no one wanted to ever talk to her, and my manager just didn't seem to see a problem with it. This lady was just plain mean - she was accusatory, demanding, high-maintenance, and her work wasn't even that good. Yet yesterday, I go to my manager in a panic about my workload, and she immediately went to the owner to say i \"blew up\" at her. Um, excuse me?? I didn't realize ANY OF THAT was about you?? I was unloading my stress, which you said you were a safe place for??? THAT fucking kills me more than anything, those people who say \"Oh, I'm here for you, you can call me any time, I really care\" and then the moment they decide to take something personally they go around and make you feel bad for how you feel. REALLY??? This bitch rep can tell me that she has more degrees than I can count (she was upset because she got a mass email asking EVERYONE to submit more thorough reports) and my manager just thinks it's NBD, but I come to her with an actual CONCERN about how I'm going to handle my LIFE and she gets insulted??? WHY IS IT OKAY FOR EVERYONE ELSE AND NOT FOR ME????\n\nI swear to God, I feel like I could be in a line of people all doing the same thing, and I will be the one to get called out. It's like every time there's a regulation and other people blur the lines, I operate within the same metaphorical parameters and all of a sudden EVERYONE remembers how it was supposed to be and I'm wrong. If there was a score out of ten for misbehavior, my 3's seem to clock as 11's, where everyone else's seem to be to scale.\n\nThat friend in your group that no one likes that always just gets shit talked about whenever they're not around, but you keep them around because they're a person and you have spent time together or whatever, that's me. Except without the group. I have spent my ENTIRE LIFE being told that parts of my personality are unacceptable and trying to polish those pieces so they are suitable for the public, and STILL every minor perceived indiscretion is just reason to exhume me from their presence. I am so intensely, insanely jealous of those people who can just be themselves and have anyone want to be around them. I feel like I've tried everything.... no one liked who I was authentically as a child, I was always worth throwing away. Each part of me I've replaced has shaken and splintered under the pressure of having to be perfect, and now I feel like a rickety Trojan horse of discarded attributes, failed endeavors, and skeletons that no one can get too close to because I know the second they do, it's only a matter of time before they're done. I don't even know what it is. i don't even know what i do that turns people off so much. I don't know why I can't get away with the things other people seem to get away with. I'm too rigid or too ingratiating or I just don't have good energy or I just try too hard and it's repulsive. Ugh. Sorry this is so long if anyone is even reading this. I don't know, I must not be very self-aware or something. I must be doing worse than I think. I must be just not as good a person as I think I am or else people wouldn't react to me the way they do. It has to be all in my head that people treat me differently but I just watch it happen all the time!!! I can say the exact same things as other people, or do the same things, small indiscretions that most people don't care about, but when I do them it's grounds for removal. I'm now just so petrified of people all the times that I'm basically a barely-functioning ball of anxiety. Each tiny movement feels criticized. And it makes me feel crazy. i must be crazy. I just wish my fucking manager hadn't cried like a baby to our owner and triggered all this. I'm sick of changing myself to try and make other people happy when it's never enough anyway. I'm so close to just telling the world to fuck off and just be myself, but I don't know what the consequences of that could be. I might just gather people who are the same as me. I have a friend who I'm beginning to realize has the same tendency - people just decide that she doesn't get the same passes that other people do and they annihilate him for small indiscretions. We'll just form a band of misfits that people cast off for tiny reasons. This must be what incels feel like, that everyone else is working against them and they're the victim in everything, this freak-normie thing feels so real.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnyone still reading is informally recruited into my band of freaks.", "subreddit": "lonely"}

I'm not physically attractive enough for online dating. Online dating has been emotionally damaging, soul-crushing and destroying my self-confidence. I'm also ready to give up even crushing on someone because they will always reject me, leaving me more depressed than I was before. Each rejection just makes me feel worse about myself.\n\nSo I'm trying to spend my time and money and emotion on things like painting and hobbies. Those at least give me something to do, and at the end of the day I have something to show of it. It doesn't help with my loneliness, but at least I get something in return for the time and money I spend, rather than just frustration and bitterness. Everyone says \"you need to be happy with yourself first,\" and stuff like that. Even my therapist says \"You should spend your time and money on yourself and things you like, rather than on trying to find a woman.\" So I'm trying as best as I can to work on that.\n\nBut the one thing that I'm lacking, which is still making me so depressed, is physical intimacy. And I don't just mean sex. I'm talking about cuddling, physical affection, sleeping together, etc. I hate going to bed alone. I think that's the worst part of being FA - going to bed love-less, and knowing that I'm going to wake up tomorrow and still be love-less.\n\nHow do I handle that??\n\nPorn helps with sexual needs, at least a little bit, though it still doesn't leave me feeling satisfied. And it's only fantasy. And it doesn't give me any kind of physical touch or intimacy I need.\n\nA year ago, I hired an escort, thinking it would help. But it didn't. I'm embarrassed to say I couldn't even stay hard. It did nothing for me. There was no foreplay, there was no intimacy, there was no emotion. Just \"You have one hour, go\" and then I had a timer going. I couldn't even communicate to her what I wanted because she didn't speak more than about 2 words of English (which makes me wonder if she was even in the country legally).\n\nIt did nothing for me but leave me feeling even more empty inside. I was rather embarrassed, although at the end of the day she probably doesn't care - she got paid and that's why she's doing that. It made me so depressed that I can't actually find romance, that I had to pay for it. And even then I didn't get anything emotionally out of it. To add insult to injury, I'm still angry at myself because I could have spent that $200 on so many other things that could have at least given me something.\n\nSo depressing. I am learning to do activities, etc. on my own, but at the end of the day I still go to bed alone without any physical contact with anyone. How do I handle the lack of physical intimacy?", "subreddit": "ForeverAlone"}

I get it, but I think it\u2019s mostly an overall inability to talk to people in general. Basically social anxiety when meeting new people, especially when you\u2019re trying to impress this person.  \n  \n2 ways that i think might help some of you improve are the following.   \nSelf Interviewing. One of the biggest complaints I hear around here is the common \u201ci\u2019m not interesting enough.\u201d Well the thing is, people like talking about themselves more then they like talking about other people. If you get the chance to go on a date, you don\u2019t want to sit there in awkward silence and say nothing. If you practice coming up with questions that can get the other person talking, first dates will go a lot better. Basically the advice here is to talk to yourself. If you can\u2019t hold a conversation with yourself, then you won\u2019t be able to hold a conversation on a date. Literally ask anything and discuss it until you need to move to the next topic.  \n  \nMy second piece of advice would be for those who are into video games. Join a discord server or a community and try to converse with people. If you find that people are tending to avoid you, or if people straight up tell you they don\u2019t want you there, it can be a good indicator for how good your social skills are. If people online don\u2019t like talking to you, reach out and ask them why. Being behind a monitor, these people will not hesitate to be extremely blunt. It can be a very positive learning experience for people struggling to maintain friends if you\u2019re willing to get shot down a couple of times.  \n  \nThen again, you could always just take a shower. Jk boys, i\u2019m just throwing shit out there that I did to try and make myself less of an awkward idiot when meeting new people. I realize that meeting people in person vs online is a completely different experience, but the only way youll get good at it is to start somewhere.  \n  \nShooting some thoughts out there until something sticks.

Just as I thought I had made some friends at work , I\u2019m starting to question that. I\u2019m kinda shy and awkward and it\u2019s hard to connect with people , especially people my own age. Anyways, I\u2019m not openly bi but a few coworkers figured it out and they are the ones that I invited to a little kickback/ get together at my house. I let them know way in advance that I was finally going to be alone because my parents were going out of town for five days or so and I was excited because I never get to have anybody over . The plan was to chill in the backyard play some adult party games and have a little bonfire and everybody thought it would be fun . Fast forward to today when I text my coworker and basically say we good for 11 tonight ? He texts back saying that\u2019s late and I said I told him that\u2019s when I get home from work. Now he backed out and cancelled on me and him and his girlfriend both aren\u2019t coming now so it\u2019s basically over . Now I have to go home tonight after a long day at work with no party to look forward to and just sit there lonely and bored all night . Here\u2019s some more bullshit- he\u2019s kind of a queer baiter, meaning he knows I mess with guys and he kinda leads me on and actually went as far as saying he would do this and that with me . I know most of this was just joking around, but I knew there was a possibility of something happening because we said that after everybody left the party he would spend the night as I was going to be alone . It was going to be fun and we would just watch movies all night but now that\u2019s not going to happen and I\u2019m kinda pissed he cancelled because this was my chance to finally do something with him. At the least I was hoping he would let me give him head . Anyways, I think he\u2019s either scared of being alone with me all night because he doesn\u2019t want to do anything that would make him \u201cgay\u201d or his girlfriend told him not to go because she doesn\u2019t want him messing with me . Either way I\u2019m now depressed and a little angry. I just ignored him over texts now and got frustrated . Should I confront him about this when he comes back to work ? Or just let it go and get over it ? I\u2019m just mad because this was my only shot. My parents never go out of town and now I have nothing to look forward to \ud83d\ude14", "subreddit": "lonely"}

I normally never have space for myself or much time for myself either.\n\nHowever, tonight is the first night for a weekend that I am house-sitting for a friend. This sounded like heaven in comparison to my normal, and it kind of is. I am feeding his cat and his bearded dragon while he is gone. I cooked for myself, handling raw meat for the first time even if it was just hamburger helper. I played on the computer a bit with some online friends and then watched a little anime and I'm now in bed.\n\nI guess what is strange to me is this feeling of nothing. I am here and there's no one else. No one to talk to. No one to share how my day was or how things've been. No responsibilities or people to keep me awake. Idk. I don't even understand whats bothering me. Am I just lonely? In truth, it's still a step up from slaving in my home for nothing in return, but it's still... Weird. Almost like something feels wrong. I'd feel lonely in my crowded house all the time among many more frustrating feelings, but this? This is just a strange place to me. Well, it's just night #1 so I guess I'll see how it goes.

Usually this is with someone online that only have conversations with you when they are bored. If you suggest at becoming friends, they back off. These people always seem to be too \"busy\" for you when you are down and could use a friend. You know they could stop talking to you tomorrow and they wouldn't care very much. This is where I'm at with everyone who talks with me and there are only a few people who even talk to me but none want to be my friend.\"\n\nSince then, I've only had a couple of people I've even gotten to the acquaintance zone with. Now I usually am in the creep zone. \n\nDoes anyone else have experience in the acquaintance zone? I'm talking more in person than online in this post unlike my post back then. It's a step down from the friend zone. They will talk to you when they are bored but if you ask them to do things together that friends usually do they will distance themselves from you. It's usually not easy to ghost on a friend but it's very easy to ghost on an acquaintance that you aren't close with. In my case due to not having a single friend in 10 years here where I am and obviously no significant others, I have become desperate to the point that I would take just being in the acquaintance zone.

I don't consider the people I work with to be friends, just close work acquaintances. First, the place we went was a small venue, elegant and for 40 people maybe. The entrance had a few steps with no wheelchair accessibility. I had to stay at the bottom until someone came to help me get in. Once there, my co-workers where all grouped around one of those tall thin tables that only serve to put your drinks on. I was there with them, while they are all standing up talking and having a good time (for what I could tell). Nobody would talk to me, and some co-workers would just check on me from time to time just asking \"everything alright?\" but not making any conversation. I was there for half an hour without talking to anybody.\n\nI then went to check the bathrooms, and they were outside, across a garden. Needless to say, rolling over there was kind of shaky. To get in to the bathroom, there were three tall steps, which were too tall for me to try to climb them in my wheelchair. I went to get my boss to ask for his help, he was talking to some people, he went to help me but then immendiatly returned to his group. Once I get to the bathroom, I see there is no bathroom for people with disability. at this point, I wanted to go pee (it happens that when I get close to a bathroom, I feel the need to go). A co-worker comes in and I asked him if he could help me by getting my chair out of the stall once I get in and close the door. He tells me to wait for him to pee. After that, he helps me, and as soon as I sit back on my chair, he leaves (apparently, he was in a rush).\n\nAgain, those three tall steps were a challenge, and I had to wait for somebody else to help me down. Once I'm back with my co-workers, they keep talking among themselves without any of them acknowledging I was there. I felt ackward and alone. \n\nI know this is not a story of \"I'm never meeting the love of my life and I'll die alone\" but I wanted to share that I felt that I didn't belonged there, even when it was with people I work with. I felt alone and helpless. Not very often this happens to me, and that's why it made me feel bad. Nobody would talk to me, I would get the usual stares (for being in a wheelchair, which I'm used to) but no conversation happened. I was there for less than one hour until I left home. \n\nThis was one of those moments that made me realized that if I had a partner, a boyfriend, he would be with me and help me when I need it.

{"post_id": "b4gwg7", "created_utc": 1553330359, "title": "Why do you think you're lonely?", "author": "waterbottle30", "self_text": "For me, it's because I try to be outgoing, try to be funny, but then make a complete ass of myself trying to make a good first impression. \n\n\nBecause in all honesty, everyday I try to be the person that I would love to have in a friend. Someone who likes edgy dark humour, but at the same time knows when to be serious and is willing to talk about their feelings. \n\n\nBut in the end, I just end up looking like a complete fool. Not many people like downers, so that's why I try to act more happy than I actually am. I don't want to disappoint people. I don't want to bring down people's moods just because I wasn't feeling good that day.\n\n\nThat's why I only want friends now, not a relationship. I don't think I'm cut out for a relationship. As much as I'd like to hold a woman in my arms, deep down I know it's just not a realistic goal. I don't think women like me. I guess you could say my personality isn't good enough. But even finding friends is hard too.\n\n\nI've met some people online. People who I adore. But the problem is, those who I adore don't live in my city. I wish my online friends lived in my area so I can hang out with them in a park and hug them, instead of writing this post. \n\n\n\nYes, hug them. For long periods of time. I'm not gay or anything, nor there's anything wrong with being gay. But I'm just very affectionate with my friends, especially if he's a close friend who I care about deeply. It's just my way of showing him that I love him, no homo.\n\n\nThough I think my intentions are ultimately selfish in the end. The only reason why I want friends is because I can't get into a relationship. I want friends so they can fill the void of me not having a partner. \n\n\nIt hurts a lot though. Just not being able to find a partner. The idea of being a family man fascinates me. Having a wife, kids, and having friends. Being able to provide for my family. I've already came up with my future children's name. Roy or Clyde if my kid is a boy. Amelia if my kid is a girl.\n\n\nBut like I said my personality is very bad and not good enough for marriage/romantic relationships. So I've decided to drop the whole \"family man\" fantasy, because I think I can find peace in using all of that energy to find friends instead. Homies for life kinda thing.\n\n\nI seem to only get along with people who live overseas though. I think my city is cursed.

I asked one close friend and she said my attitude is fine. \nThere are times that I\u2019m happy and I don\u2019t care at all about my nonexistent social life and there are days when I feel so alone and lonely. Today is one of those days. I almost cried on the car ride home. I remember before I went on a trip to Singapore (feb this yr) I was feeling soo lonely and when I got back it was even worse. My only closeish friend got close with the person I don\u2019t like. So we kinda drifted apart. She was my only closeish friend in the section. To make things worse, THE TRIP WAS MY BIRTHDAY GIFT... and after the trip that happens with my only closeish friend......\nWhenever I\u2019m feeling left out, I always think about my blessings. I am thankful that I get nice things and I get to go abroad a lot. I also always think that after high school, I\u2019m leaving everyone behind and I\u2019m going to move to au. Another way for me to cope with feeling left out is trying to be better than everyone. I go to the gym so that I look a bit better than almost everyone and I wear nice things. Can anyone give me advice when I am having one of those days when i feel left out and lonely? How can i feel less lonely and left out and how can I make friends? How can I make people like me and be the first to approach?", "subreddit": "lonely"}

{"post_id": "b4ix9c", "created_utc": 1553346131, "title": "Unsure if i'd even be capable of being in a relationship again- and that scares me.", "author": "LettersfromthePatch", "self_text": "Today I was watching yet another random romantic comedy series on netflix. Nothing too odd there- nothing overly common either. It is not like I go out of my way to watch other people fall in love or anything. It just... Today when I was watching something it made me realise a particular change which has happened over the last couple of years. The emotions I have while watching romantic comedies and other romance stories seems to be slanting away from just a simple zone of someone who loves to watch romance. It has started to slant towards a sort of melancholic longing during and existential dread once complete. Now, I have never exactly been a Casanova to begin with- most of the relationships I have had with someone on a romantic level have been online. My last major relationship ended over five fucking years ago now- but I can't seem to drop it. Now as I continue to march on closer to the massive impending wall which is 30- I find myself losing what little confidence I had in favor of a raising sense of worry. \n\nSome may say that's normal, other's may point out that 30 isn't the end of the world- some still will just wonder why the hell it even matters to me. I don't know, that's exactly it. I have reached a point where not only can I not imagine finding someone to have a romantic relationship with- but that even if I had one I would have no clue how to proceed. When I got my most recent job I assumed this could be my moment. My time to make the world make sense again. Suddenly I would be able to find my way once more as things started to get level. No longer would I be a broke university student- but a guy with a full time job and the ability to support himself properly. I would be forced to interact properly with the world and maybe- just maybe it would finally work out for me. For the most part it has, but the part which continues to elude my very existence is that of having a partner. I have reached a point of learned helplessness where I am unable to have the confidence to even attempt say- online dating, tinder or anything which a normal person may do to meet someone. It doesn't help that I am incredibly nerdy, mildly autistic and don't have even the slightest desire to drink. People always love to point out at these junctures that people can always improve themselves if they want to- but- for me I do honestly like myself. It has just reached the point where I don't think anyone else will. It doesn't help that the town I am in while not tiny is not exactly a place where I am likely to meet someone. Doing your best to be the helpful and happy sort is fine for making people not hate you- but it doesn't magically make people who you are compatible with appear.  \n\nIt has reached a point where I look at my life and even beyond the prospect of searching for that one- I wonder how I would even manage to hold a relationship. Recently I have been doing my best helping out with political activities for example- and being exposed to all these non nerdy types is making me just- stop- wonder- how could someone even fit into my life. How would it even work, how could I not somehow screw it all up. I always assumed that nerds like me mostly find their partners through their friends. But when half of your friends are online and the rest don't seem to know anyone it seems rather hard. Even when someone did say a friend of theirs knew someone, I couldn't work out how to even consider contacting them- even when given a possible opening text message to send. I wanted to know more before I even tried- wanted to know all the intel before I even began so I didn't do something entirely wrong. In the end it just sort of disappeared because I was so fucking afraid of the unknown I didn't even try. Generally learned helplessness seems to be linked to learning or performing a certain skill. While I suppose technically socialising could be considered a skill, it seems slightly out of place to consider it on par with the regular usage even when all signs point to it being the case. \n\nI assume everyone is happily in a relationship til I find out otherwise- then sometimes even when I do find that out I am so self defeating that I can't even work out a way to ask. Last post I wrote here was about how I was afraid of becoming bitter. I still don't think I have became bitter- not just yet... but- the impact seems to be similar. I just. I don't know what to do- even when I do think I know what to do somehow I still can't bring myself to pull that trigger. Things seem so much simpler in romantic comedies- and in those worlds they are designed to be overly dramatic and with terrible timing by default. Look, I know this isn't likely the best use of the /r/loney subreddit but... this is all causing a massive level of loneliness. Sure I still have friends and family but- over five years feels like a heck of a long time to just... slowly be chipped away at. I couldn't post to /r/foreveralone because I clearly wasn't FOREVER alone- but recently- I have really started to feel it. It comes in waves- it is uncontrollable and annoys me to no end. It has reached a point where I am so desperate to wonder if anyone even thinks of me that way that I have been scouring /r/unsentletters just for the minute chance that someone posted one for me. I go to the theatre, I watch netflix- I play games. So many different stories- romances- people to just push myself into and imagine what it could be like. But in the end all that it does is leads me with an ever increasing level of sadness. \n\nI wish I knew what more I could do,  but I know that even if I did I likely would fuck it all up anyway. I miss feeling that level of comfort and safety that can come from a decent loving relationship. I do indeed feel lonely. *sigh* I suppose all I can do now is go to sleep, try to enjoy what little remains of my weekend and try to hope this particular wave passes soon. bleh", "subreddit": "lonely"}

I have these 2 friends, they both know I am...let us say \"romantically challenged\".  \n\n\n\\- One of them, SUPER fit, very into sports. He loves to go on and on about how he longs for a relationship. Has numerous exes, sex friends, has 0 problems to get laid on Tinder.

He always gives me this long speeches about how my only flaw is giving up, and that i need a more positive attitude.

He never goes more than 3 days without being with a girl. He is always going on and on about \"how tiring it is, and how much he wishes he didnt need it\". To me this is very insulting.

He really enjoys giving this image of tortured soul who is always brooding, despite he has 0 reason to do so.  \n\n\nWith both of them we often get into discussions or even heated because they insist how \"their problems are real too\" and how \"their life is a struggle too\" . But from my point of view...they just like to believe that, because no one wants to admit they have it easy. They can insist as much as they want about how insecure they feel. They clearly do not understand what insecure means. They both get as many girls as they want...that is not being insecure. I feel they use this to downplay my problems.... often they insist \"they totally have problems too\" ..but I just do not see it. And yes...I know...one can never know what goes on in other people's lives...but I disagree...problems are as big, as important, as their consequences. To me, normies insisting that they struggle too but then you see their results....Is like people with very comfortable lifestyles and good income complaining that \"they too struggle to make ends meet\"  because they cannot afford a private jet...when I cannot afford eating.  \n\n\nSorry about the rant.  \n", "subreddit": "ForeverAlone"}

If you masturbate more than once a week that is not \"normal\". Multiple studies have proven that excessive porn and masturbation really screws up your dopamine receptors to the point you don't get much pleasure or motivation to go out and improve your life (no, I'm not talking about you miraculously going out every night and attracting hordes of women). It also significantly lowers your testosterone levels which severely impacts strength, assertiveness, and drive. You know I'm not wrong, you just want to take the easy route and get instant pleasure . That's fine, but if tens of thousands of former fappers (including myself) say abstaining from masturbating, not even for religious reasons, has dramatically improved their energy and enjoyment out of life then why would you not try it? Sometimes you have to take risks in life. Risking missing out on a week or month of pleasure (until afterwards when you look and feel like a pathetic loser because you just jerked off to other people having sex while you go back to your lonely unmotivated existence) is not a big risk.\n\nI know I'm going to get a lot of hate for this post but I can't in good conscience let this go by if there is a possibility somebody considering nofap gets discouraged by the minority of bitter people here who are the last people that should be giving advice when it comes to anything sexual. \n\nFor the first time in 10+ years I felt like a kid again after abstaining for just a week. My whole outlook on life changed. No, it wasn't placebo, I genuinely felt optimistic about my life for the first time in a long time. I literally couldn't believe it. Nofap may work for you or it may not but this obsession with encouraging people to keep masturbating like it's a necessity is sad. \n\nI'll end with this documented interaction with one of the greatest thinkers of all time:\n\nHusband: \u201cKindly instruct me as to how many times a man may have copulation with his wife.\u201d\nSocrates: \u201cOnly once in his life.\u201d\nHusband: \u201cBut if that fails to satisfy him?\u201d\nSocrates: \u201cThen he can have copulation once a year.\u201d\nHusband: \u201cBut if that too doesn\u2019t satisfy him?\u201d\nSocrates: \u201cThen let it be once a month.\u201d\nHusband: \u201cAnd if he is still not satisfied?\u201d\nSocrates: \u201cThen let it be twice a month, but this will cause an early death.\u201d\nHusband: \u201cWhat should he do if he is not satisfied with that either?\u201d\nSocrates: \u201cWell then, do it this way. Dig a grave, purchase a coffin and a shroud for yourself beforehand, then you may spoil yourself as many times as you wish.

So today I decided hey I needed some freshness and time spent with my family. I meditated,  ate a very healthy meal (Indian),  and played a bit of xbox. \nSo far so good. \n\nSo noon,  we go to the dog  park.  Now I don't have the greatest relationship with these 2 older siblings but they alright.  For some reason they decide hey let's get as many dogs as we can quickly so they are now walking with 5 on a leash,  to the skimpiest poor name excuse of a dog park I've ever seen. \n\nSimilar to... a sandwich with nothing on it.\n Anyways.\n\nI go and slowly crutch my way to the bench,  cleear to  the other side of \"park\" with my puffy ugly green jacket unzipped. I'm not in a beauty pageant I think,  alright,  and my brother and sister are just fine looking silly with 5 dogs.  Let them have fun. I'll enjoy the heck out of this sun breeze and dog/ppl sight.  Like that park bench bloke who quietly sits and watches.  yeah.  Look,  a guy and gal are giving me weird vibes imma go get near ish to hear them out &gt;=) \n\nAnd so I sit and place my crutches.  The two sure look awkward. This young lady has like a perfect combo red beanie,  with blk winter coat combo that you'd see in a nice TV show or movie.  And this young man,  well I won't say much. But he's a thin well kept young man. Ok dangit i have to he's like an ear enlarging, blk T-shirt  thin-build kid IN ALL BLK.  Look at his weird distance and did he just shuffle away like he's hesitant yet giving her space??? \nI can already tell. I want to be kind.  I should just yell to them, \n\"hey.  Man. Ask her,\n\n  \"\"hey girl you wanna go out\"\" or something man sheesh.\"\nRed beanie is all smiles being polite. But is stiff and giggling to herself really its a one sided convversation.  I listen to the birds.  \nThis is too good. \nHold on now,  \nshe says, \n\n\"Well it's  nice talking to you. \" \n\nAnd he talks! Oh no. She\n moves her right leg to the right,  ooo hes done it now shes sidestepping sideways!  As a CLEAR indication.   And she's off. \nWell she never really faced him and instead had her whole body facing...not towards him lol\n\nSo that's done.  My sisters dogs runs up to me and wants a good loving pat getting fur all over me as he jumps to my laps. Aww if this werent a dog park I wouldnt pat you with a smile but with a scowl I sarcastically thought.  =-)  My sister walks towards me and sets her stuff down next to me.  Just then,  I spot a young lady,  behind my sister just passing by towards the exit on my left.  And she has a cute face.  She's in all black,  not too long black hair with a normal shaped face,  not chubby or thin.  But this isn't what really mattered.  It was the vibe.  I just felt you know shes on a similar level with me in a way. . \n\nCaw caw,  caw\n,  \nIts a stupid crow being dumb behind me.  Somehow I feel that caw... always means something. \nI chat with my sister.  Then she up and walks away with the dog on leash in an off leash park.\n\n *slaps head*\n \nI stare around mostly at the sun now.  With my eyes closed obviously cuz it just came out. Feels nice,  I think to myself. \n\nHey.  Its her.  Its the black haired lady who walked in front of me and she's doing it again.  But this time to a bench just to my right! \nNice. \nI didn't say hi.  I was staring at the sun,  you know,  what do you think this is hehe.   It didn't come up.  Any chance for convo I guess. I don't know why but its still a good vibe. \nSo now I'm think, \"how to start a convo with her.\"\n\"Its got to be natural.  But do I want to be funny about it\" Hmm, \nA dog runs up to me.  Its like a poodle.  Instant smile \ud83d\ude0a.  i love it because it has all these little black curls on it and just curls everywhere. \n\nIt goes off. And time passes away. \n\nAnd it comes back. Its so cute and happy and it gives me smiles.  I don't know why Blk Curly likes coming to me but I sure like it. \nShe calls it over. \nWait,  its hers???  Great!  This'll be a piece of cake I just want to know what kind of dog it is and convo will genuinely  take off from there =-) \ni get up to ask this question.

With my crutches,  hobbled slowly to her 40 feet to my right.  \n\n\"Hey do you mind if I ask you a question? \" \nI shyly ask\n\n\"No go ahead\" with this big ol smile on her face.\nThat smile was so nice (like goddness wow) but it got me with butterflies.  I rush my q,\n\n\"What kind of dog is that I'm just curious?\" \n\n\"Oh its just a poodle\" she laughs \n(I forgot whether it was a he or she,  sorry) \n\n\"Oh its real nice especially  the little black curls,\"\nAnd with that I turn away and crutch away\n\nLike a fool\n\nI clearly am. \n\nToo many easy things that could've been said,  like \"how do you get it's  curls like that\" and maybe a joke about wanting to have a poodle just like that.\" I.

Then something happened and my birthday came around that year, and for some/whatever reason i didn't feel sad or lonely at all. I treated myself to a cake (lol) a nice buttercake with blue icing and my name in the middle, like a person-sized cake, and i enjoyed it my way.

Once I learned to appreciate that and cultivate that, it started fixing my problems with loneliness.\n\nAnd that's *kind of* how I feel now. I feel like my first rub with r/lonely allowed me to realize that i really *do* like my company, and that's not a problem, and that's somethingn i should feel comfortable with.

Today he told me the reason most of my co-workers don't like me is that I'm annoying. He said they don't hate you, they just don't want to be around someone who is annoying to them. You need to work on it. \n\nIt's the same problem I've always had. I know it's weak to blame my autism but it makes me come off as annoying when I try to socialize. People tell me to be more outgoing but when I try they say I'm annoying or weird. He doesn't know about my autism because only the manager knows. He says my co-workers are frustrated with my inability to do certain tasks. My hand, eye coordination has always been terrible. I can't do things with my hands that most people consider simple. While at work I can do most things expected of me, things that require coordination like changing a printer is very challenging to me. Some things I've been able to improve at but some things no matter how hard I try I keep struggling at. \n\nPeople ask me why I don't have friends at work. I tell them it's because most of them dislike me. They tell me no, you are wrong. If I was more outgoing to them, I would become friends with some of them. Actually I used to be friends with a few of them. They are all gone now. Those people were really nice and I do miss them. \n\nIt is satisfying when something that the normans tell me I am wrong about or over-thinking things like with this actually ends up with me being right. I'm sure some normans will downvote and tell me to stop being annoying. I wish it was that easy. If it was that easy I wouldn't be a 35 year old FA'er. It's the same thing when I used to go out to try and meet people. I tried to work on my social skills with therapists but I wasn't able to improve. I know some people will say it's because I didn't want to improve. No, because what people find annoying is my natural personality and without the looks or status to offset it, the only way to change my personality would be to fake a different personality. The problem is, I am terrible at faking. I used to try and fake being less awkward but I would constantly slip up and stutter. \n\nTL;DR, got someone to admit I'm annoying.

We talked about a bit of everything and anything and she's cool and interesting. Well anyways after a while she started getting closer and I could see the way she was looking at me that she wanted to kiss but I was super shy so I was kinda avoiding her eyes, so she scratched my back tried to make me relax. She asked if I was ok I just said \"sorry I'm really shy\" and she said it was ok. But after a bit I thought fuck it and I went in for the kiss. That felt really good and it lasted pretty long, it kinda escalated we took our clothes off but when she started grabbing my dick I told her I wasn't really ready yet. She understood and said it was ok. I still ended up rubbing her clit til she came and that was pretty cool ngl lol. We just cuddled and kissed til late in the night.\n\nI didn't sleep very well but the next day we ended up doing the same, we chilled in bed all day just kissing and cuddling and whatnot. I had to go around 6 pm, I kissed her goodbye and that was it.\n\nNow idk where she wants things to go, and she said before she didn't want to settle down yet, and tbh I'm fine with that. Cause legit her being fat like that makes her unattractive to me, I just couldn't help it. I'd be fine being friends with benefits I guess.

Alongside restaurants, we would have sextaurants, where people who need to sex up can go to meet and mingle, then find a partner. \n\nNow you might be thinking, but what about all the undesirable people? What if someone can't find a willing partner? Do they just wilt away and die? But hear me out. Through a more strict evolution, all those negative traits would be eliminated. Everyone is good looking. Everyone is immune to any possible STD. People who haven't had sex in a while develop this blueish, grayish hue on their face as a sexual signal to potential partners. As they get closer to the three day mark, they become so irresistible that finding a partner requires no effort at all. Indeed, when a man and a woman are having a conflict and can find no resolution, it is a cultural norm to lock them in a room for three days, because they will inevitably settle their differences and have sex.\n\nNow...how would a species so obsessed with sex get anything else done? How would they defend themselves from predators? How would they have enough time to hunt for their own food? It's not scientifically feasible. Well that's where you're wrong again. Hear me out. One in every five male births produces a tall, muscular male, perfect in every physical way. They are asexual and unappealing to the females. Instead, these \"Chad\" males only derive pleasure from working for the benefit of the community, while the normal men maintain the task of keeping the disproportionate number of females sexually satisfied. \n\nAnd you might be thinking, what about unwanted pregnancy? But hear me out. In the same way we can choose to put food in our mouths to taste it, but not swallow, the females would have evolved muscles in their fallopian tubes that allow them to decide whether to \"swallow\" the semen or not. And the inside of the vagina has developed receptors that allow them to \"taste\" the semen, enhancing their feeling of orgasm. Throughout evolutionary history, any unwanted sex immediately fails to impregnate the woman, thus all forms of male domination and violent aggression are weaned out of the gene pool. The two sexes live in better harmony and understanding of each others' desires. Instead, those aggressive traits are concentrated in the \"Chads.\" \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nDamn...the shit I come up with when I spend all this time alone...", "subreddit": "ForeverAlone"}

I don\u2019t have \u201cproblems talking to people\u201d, I\u2019m incredibly outroverted. I can \u201ckeep a conversation\u201d, there are never awkward silences... but I\u2019ve been realizing of late that the way I talk with people is entirely **performative** and **ingenuine**.\n\n\nThe reason I\u2019m posting here is because it\u2019s really ingrained in my head. And it came from a young age. I was sort of taught when I was younger not to be myself, per se. In  grade school, I had trouble having friends, so my dad recommended me \u201chow to win friends and influence people\u201d. He didn\u2019t really speak to me about how to be a better version of myself, kind of suggested to be a **different** version of myself. \n\nSo basically, through out my life, I\u2019ve targeted problems that I\u2019ve had socially (awkwardness, being too silly, being clingy, being too loud, etc ), and created a new profile for myself. I created filter after filter of how I should talk and act. The problem is I like people, I like talking to people and with people. I have no problem engaging people in conversation, and **I desperately want to be liked**- and that\u2019s the issue.\n\n\nOver time I developed this way of talking; it\u2019s very performative. Because I want so badly to be liked- I am incredibly afraid of  not being liked- the way I talk reflects that. I try to talk about commonalities, make everything into a story, and work in a very \u201ccalculated\u201d way to be engaging. I\u2019m never really myself, and it\u2019s not really a conversation. I think that leads to a lot of shit. People don\u2019t hate me, they just kind of never want to actually get to know me, because there is this kind of separation. Like I\u2019m not talking with them, more at them(even though I actively try to engage them in conversation, but it\u2019s Just so... ingenuine). My girlfriend said that I can\u2019t form connections with anyone, and that people always feel I\u2019m incredibly fake. It\u2019s strange because I don\u2019t think she means I\u2019m fake in the way that I \u201cpretend\u201d to like people or say I\u2019ll do things. It\u2019s not the usual \u201cfake.\u201d I\u2019m fake because how I talk with people is calculated and performative and people don\u2019t feel like I am connecting with anyone. They\u2019re talking to me, yeah, and it\u2019s not \u201cawkward,\u201d but it\u2019s not a conversation either.\n\n\n\nSo I want to be normal. I don\u2019t know how to do it. My whole life (at least conscious social life) I\u2019ve worked to \u201chone\u201d how I interact socially. There are layers and layers of filters, and at the bottom of it is that I feel like no one actually will like me. Which is fucking ironic, because in becoming so calculated/performative that **nobody** likes me. I mean I have friends and they like hanging out with me and drinking, but I never get invited to hang out. To talk. To get dinner. Yeah I get invited to parties and people party with me, but I don\u2019t have any genuine connections. \n\n\nSo yeah. I need to get rid of these filters. To just kind of be me and genuine. And it\u2019s hard because when I\u2019m trying to remove the filter, I fear myself and what people will think of me and then can\u2019t speak. It\u2019s scary. There\u2019s pretty much one or two people that I speak completely unfiltered, and that\u2019s my girlfriend  and another very close old friend. I don\u2019t know how to do it. I guess I know I could in theory. I don\u2019t know how to be normal. \n\n\nPlease send help lol\n\n\n**edit: someone mentioned having a girlfriend as a contrary point to this subreddit. Just wanted to come clear- she wants to break up with me. I\u2019m trying very hard to fix things, and one of the big reasons she wants to break up with me is because I talk in an ingenuine way/don\u2019t make connections, and that stems from other ingrained problems I have that has resulted in her Being unhappy  relationship.

We were at comic con when i told him i liked him, and he asked me on a date. We went to the cinema and held hands during the movie, after it was over we kissed for the first time, it felt unlike anything i had felt before. Our relationship didn't last long, after four months he broke up with me. He was a very meticulous, organized, controlling jealous person. I was quite laid back, a bit careless and at the time i liked the jealousy bc i thought that meant he cared. I started feeling like his toxic behaviour was normal, and unintentionally i recreated those attitudes. Suddently, i had lost myself in him. When he needed something, there i was, when he got mad, i took the blame, and when he wanted me back after breaking up, there i was. I wanted to please him even if it meant hurting myself.\nWhen we broke up for good, i was devastated. I did everything i could to get up again, did every activity, joined every club, hung out with every friend. The feeling of dopamine withdrawal was always present, that craving for love and attention and care was always my only thought. I only felt happiness again when i met a guy again. Suddenly i felt good again, hopeful, positive, like life was worth living. Things didn't really work out, but i met a friend of the guy who i ended up dating after only a week of texting and two dates. Yeah, i was that desperate. \nOf course, none of those relationships worked, but it was mostly my fault. I  was too busy playing the victim to realize my first relationship had made me become a toxic person too. I was going after the nice happy chemicals, and tried to avoid or brush off every issue that came up. I ended up doing some seriously fucked up shit, like lying and cheating, because i felt hurt or annoyed with the other person. Also, the guys i dated weren't the best either, they would snap at me easily, made me feel like i was awful and needed to be different, or put me in the life saver position, asking me to solve all of their issues. But they were nice enough, they told me i was beautiful and gave me affection, so everything was good right? Right...?\n After breaking up with my last bf after cheating on him several times and lying about everything (the regret keeps me up at night, but he is way more mature than i am and forgave me for all of this, he is doing great now and I'm really glad he's found happiness)  i downloaded tinder to quench my desire to have as much sex as humanly possible. After some awful experiences, i stumbled upon a guy who i ended up dating for six months. Out of pure fucking luck, i had met \"the one\". He wasnt toxic, he made me feel loved, validated and cared for me in a way that no one ever had. I returned the favor by working on my issues and making an actual effort to be a kind, supportive and honest girlfriend. I actually did learn from my mistakes this time, and i also begun trying to be happier, returning to the things i stopped doing because i was trying to fit in and be more like whoever i was dating at the time. He gave me the love and strength i needed to push forward. Sadly, he soon realized that his feelings towards me were only platonic and eventhough he really did care about me, he wasn't into me, or any girl for that matter. This happened a few days ago.\nOne of my exes once told me i was living in a circle i needed to get out of, or else i would never change. This vicious cycle of meeting someone, dating them without much time to really get to know them, breaking up less than a year after, feeling lonely, rinse, repeat. He was a bit of an ass, but he was right. Thing is, i don't have a fucking clue of what to do. I've never been this bored in years. I've got no one to talk to, nothing to do, nowhere to go and a lack of will to get out of my bed as a cherry on top. I've tried to do things that i liked and they have brought little to no joy, i feel this inner self hatred and suicidal thoughts growing and growing and i have no clue about who i am. Not. A. Single. Clue.\nThe worst thing is, i know better. I know better than to go on and find someone else, i know better than to chase that high with drugs or parties. So there are two opposing forces, on one hand the youthful fuckup and on the other the nun who feels I'm cursed to live a life without any love pleasure or unpredictability. \nSo there you have it, id love to hear advice or similar stories if you have them.\n\n ", "subreddit": "lonely"}

Not only that but the subject they\u2019re droning on and on about is something you have 0 interest in.  Not now, not tomorrow, not as a career, not ever.  Let me tell you how fucking useful all that algebra and biology is now at 31.  ABSOLUTELY NONE WHATSOEVER.

I learned about [CPTSD](/r/CPTSD), and gained more understanding of how I'm traumatized. I also started to understand how I dissociate from my emotions. This dissociation from emotions also restricts emotional expression toward others.\n\nI already suspected socializing didn't work for me because I didn't do body language and emotion aspects. But that is actually something even deeper, involving not processing things emotionally and very rarely connecting emotionally with others.\n\nLong ago, when I first felt severely lonely, my perspective seemed very naive and messed up. I wanted to satisfy cravings I had and wanted to feel the improvement in my experience of life which apparently happened due to being with others. As far as I can tell the way I behaved then was very emotionally dissociated.\n\nThis is a tricky problem, because it isn't talked about much. People seem to take the emotional elements of social interaction for granted in most cases. Descriptions of behaviours don't communicate it either. Behaviours can be faked, which confuses things.\n\nI find faking of behaviours unpleasant. It's certainly more difficult and it lacks the emotional impact of a more genuine behaviour. The most intense unpleasant aspect though is how it seems inherently painful. I don't totally understand this. Probably a large chunk of that pain is due to dissociated negative emotions being felt as a vague painful discomfort.\n\nActually, I guess I do something more than just faking. It's like I'm trying to make the expression genuine and am trying to mold my emotions to conform with it. The contrast between feeling sad and trying to express happiness can be painful. There might also be pain regarding neglecting myself by prioritizing expressing what I think I should over my own needs.\n\nI wonder if \"fake it till you make it\" applies here. Does disconnected socializing help lead toward healthy socializing, or can it instead create more bad habits? I suspect risk of the latter, and it seems I first need to sort out my emotions and then socialize.", "subreddit": "ForeverAlone"}

I'm just another depressed guy complaining on here, I'm aware. But, I'm gonna rant anyways, so kindly fuck off if you're going to be a smartass. Anyways, being single sucks. It's one of the reasons why I'm so damn miserable and suicidal. It really is. I mean, I think about it a lot. And unhealthy amount, most likely. Thinking about how, if I was less ugly or if my personality were better or if I was more intellectual, something like that, I'd have somebody who loved me for who I am. I ain't no nice guy or anything, I definitely don't belong on r/niceguys. I know damn well that I'm not entitled to a relationship, nor am I entitled to happiness or anything, really. But goddamn does it suck to see other people happy with their significant other. I don't have ill will toward anybody for it, but I'd he lying if I said I didn't have a damn good bit of envy for them. It may be slightly bitter envy, but I still don't have any ill will toward them, even if I act like it sometimes. Anyways, yea, it hurts. Watching people kiss, and hold hands, and laugh and smile with each other, and go on dates. Hell, my brother even has a girlfriend, and he sort of only wants one for sex and stuff. At least thats what he says. But, it's hard to read the guy. I mean, he's really hard to read. You can hardly tell if he wants to hug you or slit your throat half the time, though he'd never do anything beyond a hard punch to the arm or a kick to the groin. Anyways, that makes it even worse. He's  always got a girl to flaunt off in front of me, even if it may be unintentionally. I'm happy for the guy, really, I am. But it sucks. He has amazing social skills, everybody at school loves the guy. Then there's me. Nobody knows me, and if they do, they think I'm weird or that I'm not worth their time. And, honestly, maybe I'm not. I dunno. I mean, I wouldn't be my own friend. My depression makes me too inconsistent. And I can be super bipolar. I really can. One moment I'm in a decent mood, the next moment I'm pissed off at you for some reason. It doesn't happen all the time, but it happens at least once a day. My few friends say it isn't my fault, since I technically wouldn't be able to control bipolar disorder (if I have it, I'm not officially diagnosed), but I tell them it doesn't matter. I'm still an asshole that can't control his damn emotions. I mean, I'm so inconsistent, not only are my emotions inconsistent, but my messages and plans are inconsistent too. I'll message somebody, hoping to continue a previous conversation or start a new one, or I'll make plans with a friend, just to get super depressed out of nowhere or because of something I saw or did or something, making me completely stop responding to messages, or to not show up to or cancel the plans I made. I mean, who'd love that, let alone be friends with that? I don't know if I'm at fault, or if I'm simply in the wrong place at the wrong time. Or both. Who knows. Anyways, back to the whole love thing. I really wish I had a girlfriend or something. Somebody to share a bed with at night, and not for sex, get your damn mind out of the gutter. Just so we can cuddle and watch scary YouTube videos or something, or just talk about life. Someone to take long walks with late at night, as I usually do. Somebody I can make happy and can be happy, or at least content, with. Stuff like that. I mean, obviously sex would be nice, especially with somebody who reciprocates my love, but it isn't required for me. I could do with out, even if I am quite a lustful person. It probably doesn't help that I smoke and drink. If cigarettes were more readily available to me, since I'm technically not of legal age for them, I'd smoke like a chimney. And, I bet I'd be an alcoholic if I had the money and legal ID for the stuff. It's bad, very bad, I know. But, I can't help it. Cigarettes help calm my nerves, since my mom won't let me get anxiety medication, and alcohol let's me be a fun goofball. It's a nice change of pace from being depressed all the time. But, I realize how bad for me they are and stuff. Anyway, I doubt I'd find anybody who would put up with my ugliness, poor personality, AND my smoking and drinking habit. I mean, hell, my only good quality is my musical ability. And that's still not the best thing. There s a ton of people waaaaaay better than me with music. Sums me up as a person, I'd say. Anyway, this lost is long as all hell, so I should close it here. If anybody relates or has advice or whatever, feel free to comment or message me, if anybody reads this, that is. But, if you wanna be a wise-ass, just piss off. I just wanted to vent in a non-linear style for once. Cheers.", "subreddit": "lonely"}

You didn't ask to be attracted to who you're attracted to, and yet you are. It almost makes you wish there was a god because atleast then you would have someone to blame and complain to. If god were real, you could ask him why he made you attracted to anyone, knowing perfectly well that the body he gave you isn't attractive to most (if not all of those people). Unfortunately he doesn't exist, so the lack of someone to blame and complain to turns into self-loathing. Especially when you're looking in the mirror. But if you can see yourself in the mirror, then who is the one seeing? And who is the one being seen? Which one are you? The self that's seeing or the one being seen?\n\nWell either way, you're biologically programmed to want what you can't have. What makes it even worse is it almost seems like everywhere you look, there's pretty girls and couples enjoying each other; on the train, at uni, at work, on tv, love songs on the radio, in your dreams. It's constantly being flashed before your eyes, as if to remind you of what you'll never have.\n\nEvery attempt you make to escape from being alone just turns into a reminder that you will be alone for as long as you live. Ofcourse noone can tell the future, so how can you be so sure? Well, a few years ago you were exactly where you are now, dealing with same feelings. Things might have actually been better back then because atleast you had hope and some energy to still try. Now you've been around and played the game long enough to realise that not everyone can win it, infact, not everyone should play it. So you now realise that hope is only an illusion, a mirage which kept you chasing the future, and kept you going for a while, but now you're tired. Unfortunately, with the way life is now, the only place you can get to truly rest is in a coffin.\n\nIt makes you wonder if it's time to let go of all your hopes and dreams of getting love, and also giving it. Maybe there's peace in letting go and dropping all your effort. Maybe not everyone is meant to be loved in that way. Maybe you're not meant to *be loved*, but you're meant to *be love*.That means nothing to you for now though, you probably even resent that statement.\n\nMaybe some of us are meant to learn to find love within ourselves, and leave it at that. Who knows? At the end of the day none of this even matters. We're just specs of dust floating around on a rock in space. In a few years we'll be gone and noone will even remember that you were here and felt all this pain. But ofcourse the pain still feels real, just like in a nightmare when nothing is actually happening in reality, yet you still feel scared in the dream.\n\nMaybe life is just a dream and when you die, you wake up.

Although i knew a lot of people but when i think of it now, each one of them were toxic, as these \u201cfriends\u201d would call me gay and treat me like shit, but i still used to hang out with them because i didnt want to be that kid who had no company.\nI then  switched schools after 10th standard just to get rid of them except of one girl whom i used to like a lot(i promise this is not a friendzone story \ud83d\ude05).\nSo, one day i told her that i liked her and she said that she did too, but a week later she broke up with me because her friends started to tease her for being with me.\n1 year after trying to move on with all the bullshit that had happened, i met this guy whom i could genuinly call my best friend. \nWe were like the guys who did all the things together. We used to be like the most notorious duo in class, eat together at lunch, meet everyday at our spot after school and so much more.\n\nLater when i joined college, it was like the worst thing that had happened. I became more homesick. I didnt have anyone to talk to for a year and my interactions with my best friend became less frequent. \n\nI later came across this girl who became a part of our group because she was my friends friend from high school(i didnt talk to her back then). She liked him but he but he was in a physical relationship with her as friends.\n\nSo soon me and her became closer while my best friend became distant. When i met her one day in person, she asked me to kiss her and stupidly i had my first kiss with my best friends kind of ex. \n\nI started to develop feelings for her.\n\nI knew that i was wrong for this and i know i did break the \u201cBRO CODE\u201d so i told my best friends about everything but he said he was cool with it.\n\nSo some months later i told her i had feelings for her but she said she didnt and she still liked him( they were secretly dating at the time i proposed her). After this heart break i told my best friend about all this but he suddenly started to talk rudely and tried to cut me off, which later turned into a fight and we weren\u2019t friends anymore after that. The reason being, she told him that i was saying some things that weren\u2019t true behind his back(which sounds like a stupid reason).\n\nSo i finally decided to cut everyone off, starting off with deleting all my social media profiles and changing my number.\n\nFast forward today, i feel very alone and haven\u2019t talked about this to anyone so i felt like writing this here just to get some help on what to do. \nI sleep almost 12 hours a day and dont go to college because i feel too alone there and i cant sleep at night because i overthink about all the things that have happened.\nThe only people i talk to are my roomates who are a pain in the ass \ud83d\ude05", "subreddit": "ForeverAlone"}

It was \"I have to get to know this girl.\" You and I became close friends shockingly fast! Where we once strangers to seeing each other everyday almost 24/7, even at church. Never in my life had I known someone that I was simply excited to see, hear from, find out all about, or want to know about your dreams of the future, and everything in between. Meeting you defined my early college experience. There's no other way of putting it. I gave you my entire identity. My whole self being. I always stood ready on stand by for anything you could have wanted or needed. I miss you singing to me, your thoughtful words, the most full hugs anyone could give, and your smile. Never had a friend given me a gift for my birthday before, but just after our short time together you gave me the best gift, your friendship. I cherished it for every moment. I love you with all my heart. If you die, I die. That's how connected you made me feel for you. I couldn't fathom these emotions that were going through my mind. I haven't ever been in a relationship before, the thought of even touching another person used to make me feel uneasy, but when I'm around you things are just natural. That's how it felt, just natural. There didn't seem to be anything forceful about us being around each other. Others saw this too, and that made me feel uneasy. In my heart and in my mind we were together gf &amp; bf, someday to be husband and wife. But I knew this wasn't exactly true. You were stolen from me by your mother to another guy, a family friend of yours. I wish I had been a different person than I was before it was too late, the person that could tell you that I like you. I just couldn't at the time, there were other things going on too. Then I had to simply end things. I wanted the pain to go away. The thought of you and somebody else makes me ill to my stomach. The moment I sent you away I regretted it. Now with just a year left of college you purposely sit on the other side of the lecture to avoid me. You surround yourself with a click you've gotten to know. Meanwhile I'm here suffering from the mere thought of you. I wish you would talk to me again. I want to hear your voice again speaking to me. I don't want this pain anymore. I wish for my birthday a new pain, any other will do. I hate you mom and dad for raising a perfectionist. Someone that could never interact socially in a normal way, or to even train me for this kind of pain. Why did you have to push away anything social about my life.

Subconsciously I knew I was a really lonely person because I often find myself wanting to have company when I am basically doing anything. From doing errands to being at home, I usually enjoy talking to someone to feel relaxed because when I don't, I get tense and nervous. Though I am posting for a whole completely topic lmao\nRecently, I managed to get my feelings reached out to a girl that I liked for awhile and we both knew each other for like 4 years, felt like a huge achievement to tell her, but getting those feelings accepted and hearing that she felt the same way I was surprised and happy. I was longing for a serious relationship for years because the last serious one that I had was emotionally rough and not healthy at all. We started going out about a week ago, things went peachy and things felt smooth! I had high hopes for this to work and so did she. She told me that she wanted to pursue some of her goals which involved getting more involved with her church and focusing more on University, and I fully supported her through those goals. The issue that I didn't realize beforehand is that our relationship and her goals were going to conflict each other because of certain strict rules her religion had when it came to relationships. One of those rules was that she wasn't able to do any sort of physical contact, which also including kissing, something that we both did on our first date without realizing it. It didn't bother her at first but through the times I met up with her, I noticed she was getting more tense and uncomfortable each time. It wasn't until at the end of the week where she confessed her issues with what was going on and how she was feeling like things were moving fast. She was a indecisive person and even though she knew she shouldn't be doing those kinds of things, she still wanted to do em, and same with her emotions towards me. She liked me a lot, she didn't want to let me go at all. She wanted me to stay even though there was no solution to satisfy both parties involved. We both want to be together and grow with one another, though I just wasn't sure how that would be possible. The hardest part came where I had to make the decision myself that things weren't going to work out, sounds obvious enough if relationships don't hold up. I ended our week long status because I wanted her to focus on her goals, so that she can achieve what she wants to do. It may not sound like much and given we only went out for a week, it shouldn't be anything taken seriously. Though given that we known each other for quite a while, and how our feelings kept growing after the confession, I feel like there is something missing now, my days just feel grey and not really full of life. I'm not depressed but more like simply out of it. Anywho, I just felt like sharing because it doesn't want to leave me alone mentally lol", "subreddit": "lonely"}

Maybe it's because I accidentally stumbled upon this sub while browsing reddit on which I already have an account? Anyways, that's just my story regarding being FA. Nothing more, nothing less.\n\nTill the end of the high school I was alone by my own choice. I mean I had friends and enough of a social life (not much, but enough for an introvert person to have that need met), but I was alone regarding relationships. By my own choice. Because I simply didn't want to and it had nothing to do with any sadness nor anxiety which I didn't even feel back then.\n\nAfter the high school I went for a two-week trip with my friends. And then it happened. A Day Zero as I refer to it. I fell in love with a friend of mine. And long story short, she's chosen my friend, not me. Hurt like hell, but it didn't even surprise me that much as the only thing I really tried to do was to suppress my feelings so I could still go on as I have been going before. I broke down. Luckily another friend of mine quickly patched me up so I could eventually get up and march forward. But after this nothing remained the same. Since the Day Zero had happened, I decided I might as well find myself a gf. I wasn't desperate or anything, wasn't even actively pursuing it, juts changed my attitude towards this aspect of life.\n\nHowever, as you can guess by me posting on this sub, it didn't go well for me. Two months of relative peace (still no signs of sadness or anxiety back then) and another girl I started to like too much felt like another high-caliber bullet tearing apart my chest. I thought she had a bf, then after another two months of relative peace I accidentally learned she hadn't so I tried to do something with it, but it was impossible as there was already a guy she was interested in and from a friend of her I've learned she was not interested in me. Meanwhile, I started experiencing moments of sadness regarding me not being able to succeed on that field.\n\nAt first it wasn't much, but those feelings only grew and accumulated with time. Basically flashbacks from Day Zero and feeling depressed and worthless for not being the chosen one back then or just general sadness and fear \"how am I going to get myself a gf if girls aren't interested in me at all?\" But I carried on through this battlefield regardless of the pain (which was rather mild back then anyways). I really was eager to try, but the problem was that after high school I started studying IT, so having an opportunity to even see a girl felt like a godsend. I started to get anxious from the irony that back then when I could try (I didn't have any problems regarding approaching girls, just wasn't interested in anything more than friendship) I didn't want to get myself gf and yet when I've changed my mind I didn't have any opportunities at all.\n\nAnd so the Day Zero flashbacks and the pain of loneliness were growing as I was unable to do anything (as for flashbacks, no, I don't feel anything towards that girl anymore and I'm still good friends with the guy she's chosen back then (and they aren't together anymore so I have literally no reason to be jealous or something), these are your average flashbacks from traumatic events, nothing more, nothing less). After one year I felt really broken inside. Especially that a few trials I attempted turned out to be a total failure because all girls I asked out had already had a bf... Then I tried one more time. I asked a girl out, she agreed to meet with me and most probably she hadn't had a bf yet. Damn, we had a nice conversation, but turned out she was soon leaving to study abroad, so obviously the story had ended there, without me either winning or losing, without any real ending, just an unfinished story.\n\nAfter this point I had enough. The pain brought me down so much I didn't even bother with trying anymore (and I really truly hadn't had any real chance to try anyways). During all the time of my suffering I had social life and still have a bit of it, but all the people I see are male. This drives me insane at an insane pace. I'm fed up. The loneliness and flashbacks from Day Zero are consuming me and tearing me apart like zombies tearing the flesh of fellow survivors in post-apocalyptic fiction. Hell, my current life feels like a post-apocalyptic survival regarding this field of it.\n\nOver two and a half years have passed since the Day Zero. I'm now 21, third year of IT studies. I feel like I'm already insane from all that suffering. Each day I struggle to march forward through this painful existence. My hobbies or things I enjoy aren't as enjoyable as before. Because of this pain I don't even want to eat anymore, so only the primeval survival instinct keeps me alive when I'll get myself an (insufficient) meal after already experiencing headaches and my hands shaking from being malnourished. But as the caloric surge sets in I stop caring about eating again. I know it's unhealthy as hell but not eating is just my body's reaction to severe stress and psychological pain, although I've been enjoying eating back in high school and could eat a lot more than an average person without even gaining weight.\n\nI'm FA. And I'm so sick from it that right now even if I had a chance to ask a girl out, I'd probably just give up not only because I'm shy, but rather because I'm exhausted and drained from will to fight. And the thing that depresses me the most is that the worst is yet to come. It'll occur within the next few years when my friends will get themselves wives and start families and I'll be still on my own in this mad, brutal world.\n\nNo morals in this story, no asking for advice, no expecting anything.

Seeing casual references to love and romance (and sometimes sex) make me feel, not just lonely, but defective and cut off from the rest of humanity. Like something so integral to being human is just impossible for me and utterly outrageous and entitled for me to expect or have hope for. Like I am a failed attempt at a person.\n\nWhat is bizarre is that I have had three long-term committed relationships starting in high school and, while not exactly a count to boast about, a higher-than-average number of sexual partners, and a handful of less committed relationships. Every single time, though, I feel like this is a fluke. Someone willing to tolerate me as a partner, much less falling in love with me, is just an aberration I should not expect to ever see again. \n\nI don\u2019t know what accounts for this. A number of other trans people told me that they felt similarly before transitioning, but that the feeling dissipated with their dysphoria. I am not done with my transition, so maybe there is time for this to hold of me, too, but I\u2019m not sure. My first relationship was also horribly abusive and secret at the other\u2019s demand, and I spent four years after that in utter romantic deprivation. These might have affected things.\n\nBut it\u2019s also possible I might just be right. My number of friends dwindled after college until now I can count one or maybe two people as clear friends of mine, to neither of whom I matter as much as they matter to me. I have been single since November, after my primary partner broke up with me because my mental illness made me impossible for them to handle without damaging themselves and my secondary partner and I ghosted each other. I am trying to move to a new community this May, but I don\u2019t have much serious expectation anyone there will actually want my company. None of this bodes well.\n\nSo I don\u2019t know. Maybe I am just defective and hopeless. I hate this. I hate my life.", "subreddit": "ForeverAlone"}

Also, this post is loooong, but I really had to clear my heart. Throw away account btw.)\n\nM23, I seriously need help right now. I've been living a lonely and hopeless life. Never had any friends, and if I've got to build a friendship it didn't last long. People said I'm too strange, or they've got a boyfriend who has forbidden them to stay in contact with me. Back in school I've got heavily bullied, but I managed to get trough it, I even got the best grades on my graduation, and despite difficulties I reached my dream job. I should be happy, right? I showed them who the boss is, yeah? Well. \n\nBut I am not. I may reach everything materialistic, but I would give anything I had for some love. Needless to say, I've got depressions when I was 10 thanks to bullying, have issues with social phobia and I'm showing dangerous signs of drifting into shizophrenia. Still, I've come this far. The reason for this was one friend I've got to know in 2014.\n\nI've never met her, because of lack of money and a long distance. My life goal was to get a good job so I could get to her. But my dreams got shattered. We were the best friends, even though we had some normal fights thanks to my mental issues, she understood it and recognized my improvements. She's not mentally sick, but experienced similar things as me, which is why we've became close friends at all. She was quite clinging on me back then and I liked that. But one day changed everything: 4 years ago her best friend suddenly ignored her forever. I was there for here with everything I had, but since then she has changed. \n\nShe wasn't clinging anymore and spent less and less time on me. But it was ok, after all she's my best friend and I sweared that I will always be loyal to her. Even though it didn't seem like the deep friendship like in the past anymore, time proved otherwise over and over again. She had fears of loosing my, begged me to not leave her alone etc. Obviously, I never would do that, but any little crisis made her panic.\n\nLast april my cat disappeared, most likely died somewhere, and as a cat lover herself she should knew my pain. But somehow she acted like she didn't care. I didn't understood why, but decided to let her do that - she's my friend and I believe in her. It was painfull, but as long she talked to me I was happy. \n\nA few months later though she blocked me abd didn't answered my calls. In the middle of talking, without any reason. When she didn't answer me after a few weeks, I couldn't handle it anymore and called her a witch. We lost contact for 4 months until it was christmas. I was desperately hoping she would finally message me, but she's not the type of human who is brave enough to ask for excuse. So I did it myself - I know her good enough to be sure that she regrets it and excused myself for calling her a witch. Seemingly she had unblocked me and answered. She was extremely happy that I talked to her again, she was in fear I would hurt myself and missed me. I didn't need an excuse from her, though I'm a bit salty that she never thought about to say sorry.\n\nEverything went good since then. No fights, good talks and we had phone calls again. Luckily, because thanks to this I could focus on my trainee and finish it to reach my dream job. But it's nothing without her...\n\nTwo weeks ago she suddenly stopped responding to me. She didn't blocked me this time though. It was in the middle of a regular conversation, no fights, nothing. She just stopped responding. Ok, she's busy playing games or watching animes, and posting stuff on her facebook pages. I'm used to it that she prefers theese three hobbies over me. Thanks to her Facebook posts I at least know that nothing happened to her. I didn't want to bother her and waited a while for any response, until I asked her directly why she won't talk to me all out of a sudden. Nothing. Ok, I'm just gonna let her some time, but I at least need a \"yes\" or \"no\" when asking her if she still wants to be my friend. Nothing. Something is definitely bothering her, but I have to fight for her, even though I don't know why. \n\nI've been awake the whole night to look trough all of our conversations and sent her a dozen of screenshots of special moments. Not only good things, but also how we mastered a fight. I also included our first messages from the beginning of our friendship. But if she doesn't respond again, I don't know what to do anymore... I WANT TO KILL MYSELF.\n\nI'm in mental treatment (also just for her) and my therapist is advising me to not let her do that over and over again and to end this friendship. But sweared to stay loyal, I'd rather die in pain than leaving her alone. Literally, it's my wish to suffer if I can somehow make her feel better! But I really don't know how to deal with it without killing myself. I at least need her to say that she doesn't want to be my friend anymore. I need at least any signal from her!\n\nI'm considering taking off from work for two weeks and travel to her. It was my goal anyways and I now have the resources to do so. But while I think this would the perfect proof of friendship, I don't want to be the freak who comes from far away to suddenly appear on her doorstep. Should I do it anyways? Should I kill myself? Should I throw away everything I've got? There are so many questions and doubts my head, they begin to feel like voices that order me to fear all people and to hide me, tell me that my life is worthless and that I should kill myself. I'm drifting apart from reality and I want to stop it... I want her to come back, otherwise I can't accept any of my other friends I've got in the recent years. ", "subreddit": "lonely"}

He's an awesome person and my best friend. My only friend, actually.\n\nThere are around twenty people in my phone's contact list: him, my family and my doctors.\n\nI actually had a couple of friends when I was in high school, when you sit at pretty much the same place with pretty much the same people around you for eight years, you eventually end up befriending at least one of them. It took me around two years, but I eventually got two friends and a couple of people I could sit with during lunch break. It may not sound like a lot, but I was pretty happy during that time, I always found being around people pretty draining anyway. I also joined an online community and had a bunch of after-school activities, some of which were pretty social (drama, choir).\n\nMy whole social life fell apart once I went to university. No one I knew went to study the same program (medicine) as me - some people went to the same university, but our university has faculties all around the city so we wouldn't see each other anyway.\n\nI didn't really befriend anyone at my first program, but I eventually ended up talking to some people there. Also, I joined a medical students' organization and got a fair bit of socialization through it.\n\nHowever, medicine wasn't a great fit for me, I had two major mental breakdowns within two years, so I decided to switch it for a biology program. It also meant having to quit the medical students' organization and having to deal with a completely new set of people.\n\nAfter three years, I don't know anyone here. I don't have a single friend.

But in my village we're only around 40) where there weren't many people my age when I grew up. The few that were there pushed me out from their friend circle, but used me as \"backup friend\" when there were drama in the group. I pretty much grew up without any good friends. I met a couple others from a different school the last year of elementary, and we ended up in the same class in High School, which was pretty cool. We weren't best friends or super close, but we hung out a lot around the school (not so much in our spare time as they lived too far away). We all split after high school except for me and one other who ended up in the same class in college, which again is pretty cool. Which is where we are now.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI guess the ting is, I haven't managed to find any new friends here. Growing up with little to no friends has left me very shy and I feel a lot of presentation anxiety every time I try to talk to people. I'm not good with words either which doesn't help. My friend has gotten a lot of new friends, and no hate, I'm really happy for said friend, but I feel like I'm pushed more and more to the side. I feel pretty shitty for complaining, because of course meeting new people is exciting and I don't at all expect her to be with me and only me. But everyone seems so close with each other here and it makes me wonder what it's like to be close with anyone. A couple days ago was my 20th birthday and I really wanted to celebrate it because 20 is kind of a big deal, and I haven't celebrated since I was 14, so I thought I'd ask my friend if she wanted to go out that day (My bday was in the weekend and I asked about a week before) try to find a party somewhere, have some drinks and just have fun. Nothing too big. And she was down for that and we were talking about it for days. The day before my bday I ask her if when she wants to look for places to stay at that night and she says she no longer can because it's too expensive to head out. I feel super selfish for thinking this, but I guess this is where I feel left out as her roomie celebrated her bday a couple of days before me and she went out with her. I mean, of course it's okay to not do anything if she can't afford it, but we didn't have to go out either, would've been fun to just hang out at campus too, watch a movie maybe, play instruments, anything. I didn't say anything cuz I don't want her to feel forced to hang out with me, I just didn't wanna spend the day alone, but I ended up crying myself to sleep that night. Felt especially bad when my parents called to wish me a happy birthday and asked if I had fun and what I were doing that day, and I had to lie and tell them I wasn't going to spend it alone and that I had a great time. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIdk, what I expected from writing this, but it was good to just get it off my chest. Even if it just ends up drowning in the other posts. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTl;dr: Didn't wanna celebrate my 20th birthday alone, asked my only friend to hang out that day, said friend cancelled on me and I spent it alone anyways", "subreddit": "lonely"}

Sorry about the length but if you're willing to read, I'd appreciate it. I'm still in college and I'm graduating in May. Early last semester, I was sitting in one of the areas where people like to just hang out and maybe get some work done. This guy sits down across from me. I was absolutely struck. There have been a few times in my life when I've taken a second look at a guy but this was just unbelievable. I know this is so cliche and cheesy but I really felt like time had stopped. I couldn't believe my eyes. I was instantly so attracted to him and even to the point where I thought \"he's the one.\" I wanted to talk to him SO badly but the opportunity just didn't come up. He was staring at his phone and had his earbuds on. I didn't want to be creepy but I just couldn't help but stare at him because he didn't seem to notice. If he had looked my way, I would've smiled and asked him his name but he didn't see me. Plus, there were a few others sitting right there so I didn't want to create an awkward situation. He left and I had to get to class too. I just felt like I blew it. The week after, I went to the same spot and he was there again, so I figured he must like that spot. Still couldn't get a chance to talk to him. The next time I saw him, he was outside walking. The last time I saw him, I had to get to class but he was in that spot again. So I saw him four times but never said anything and it's mostly my fault. I haven't seen him at all this semester so obviously, I've lost hope. But, something is still lingering in me telling me it's possible something could happen. I swear, if the circumstances were good, I'd talk to him because I just have this feeling. I don't even know his name though :( I know there's really nothing any of us can do about it and there's probably no advice any of you can give but I just wanted to get this out.

I also will mention a few of my problems, please don't think I want pitty from these or use them as an excuse, they're more of an explanation for my feelings than an excuse.\n\nI'm a 21 year old Male from Australia, I have Autism Spectrum Disorder (high functioning), Obsessive Compulsive Personality Disorder, and ADHD (just started on treatment for ADHD, not sure if it's working). I'm a work-aholic, perfectionist, stubborn, sometimes arrogant and not the easiest person to be around at times, although I work on all of these. Growing up I got bullied heavily, I didn't have many friends but that never seemed to bother me, women didn't interest me much either, not until my first (and only) girlfriend that is. I've always been odd, Mums a neuroscience and father is a network engineer, both emotionally distant. I was born 3 months early and spent most of my early life in the hospital, amazingly i'm physically perfectly healthy now, asthma sometimes pops up but I haven't had an attack in over 13 years, no deformities, hell I even did modelling for a bit (sorry if that was a brag). \n\nI try to be nice, and have worked hard over the past couple years to become better with people, letting them finish their sentences, letting them talk about themselves, focusing on reading them on the fly. Due to my funky brain reading people doesn't come naturally to me, never has, instead I taught myself to read people, and how to influence people, by watching youtube videos like Charisma on Command or books that show peoples faces and the emotions linked to it. \n\nI always got good grades at school, though I never tried, when I was 4 my parents where told I was a child prodigy but that I was so \"autistic\" that without being forced to overcome my problems I would never function in life, as you can imagine I did not enjoy my upbringing. I don't really speak to my parents anymore and growing up I didn't really create any life long friends as I was that weird smart kid. Don't get me wrong I had a few, and by the end of high school as I got a bit taller and started filling out, I even stopped getting bullied as much, but these people where never truly my friends, just people I spent time with. \n\nI've always been torn between worlds, teaching myself the art of film making and studying 3D Animation at uni I applied my more technical mindset to the art I did and weirdly enough, I was good at it. Top of my class, High distinctions across the board, even won a couple competitions, yet these people still weren't' friends, just people I went to uni with. \n\nI ended up teaching myself programming about 6 months ago and now I'm building a software company with my business partner, life's been quite a bit better, but still rocky. I went to networking events to overcome my social issues and anxiety, even made people that I am beginning to call friends for the first time, but they don't understand, they try to but they don't. \n\nI've met four women throughout my life that I have had feelings for, dated one of them, all four of them have hurt me in some way (I am really bad at picking them), and each time they do they reinforce my feelings of abandonment. The latest one, I felt like she truly understood, the first one to make me feel this way, but even she turned out to be, not great, leading me on and using me for fun with no regards to my feelings for her. \n\nLogically it's silly, I'm 21, building a software company, sure I earn very little but that will change very soon, we're getting our first office, I'm meeting people similar to me, socialising more, don't live at home, generally my life is the best it's been possibly ever. Yet somehow I feel more lonely than ever, I don't feel attracted to the majority of women, physically I can see how they're attractive and even get turned on, but emotionally I feel nothing. I even went through a hoe phase, where I tried to see if I could feel something, but I found sex to be generally boring. The only time i've ever gone \"wow\" was the makeout session with my ex (we never slept together), meaning that clearly I enjoy intimacy with women I have feelings for more than not. \n\nI apologise if this is long, or sounds pitiful, I just wanted to tell people I guess, see who's listening.

Below are my thoughts about love/loneliness and how to avoid this.", "author": "EyeSackJam", "self_text": "Love:\n\nWhat is it On scientific level: hormones that make our brain feel happy. This is due to the fact humans want to reproduce and pass on their genes. This being said, Loneliness is the absence of love or rather lack of exposure to oxytocin. Of course, this love chemical cannot be simply expressed as oxytocin but it is the main component. (I would also like to point out that there is no alternate way of perfectly creating this exact chemical any way other than being in a relationship.\n\nDo we need it: \n\nyes, as with most species, we strive to reproduce and pass on our genes. When we aren't in a relationship our primal brain sends us signals in forms of loneliness in order to get us to reproduce. \n\nIs there a loophole to feel \"love\"/not lonely: \n\nI have been thinking and only came up with one idea which ultimately if void. To get rid of hormones that urge us to reproduce. This however leads to many complications, especially in some cases of chemical castration or sterilization, patients have been more inclined to development depression and suicidal thoughts. An explanation of this behaviour is perhaps that a loss of specific hormones eliminate our primal goal of surviving in order to reproduce. Therefore, this option doesn't work. \n\n\n", "subreddit": "lonely"}

I'm a 16 high school student who is a tad on the clingy side (as I will stick to someone who really matters to me) but am an overall very loyal friend. I have this one friend (I'll use the letter T to represent him) who I had since day one. We were really close and practically talked to each other on a daily basis. I would probably go to the extent of saying that we're best friends (T doesn't do best friends but the gist is we were really close). We would always hang together in our group and everything was great. \n\nBut recently, T has made new friends who he really enjoys being near with. He would always be  surrounded and followed (T is a very popular guy cause people always follow him) by the new group. Being his friend for this long, I don't think much about it because he still talks to me and we are still pretty close.\n\nTime passes, and one day, T just completely stops interacting with me. I would go to him and try to talk with him but he would respond to me in a monotone voice and have expression when near me. At first I thought he was having a bad day but right after talking with me, he straight up talks so someone else with a thousand times more energy than he did with me. At this point I kinda felt hurt and I thought that it would pass.\n\nSeveral days later, things were still the same. T was still treating me as if he barely knows me. I then decided right and there to confront him about and he answered me in the most hurtful way possible. \n(To preface: T means a lot to me because I've been friends with him for so long so he kinda knows that I need him and that I really care about him. I would probably fall apart without him)\n\nT started by telling me that he (actually said it to me) that he was no long interested in talking with me and that he no longer needs me. At that point, I started to fall apart. I asked him if he was pushing me away (he said yeah but he's not cutting me off completely). I also asked him if he knew what he was doing was hurting me and he responded with an emotionless yes (he knows that it hurts alot for me but he just doesn't care enough about me). He then goes on saying that he's happy in his new friend group and that he's happy without me being there. He also mentions to me that I didn't do anything wrong to push him away anything and that I'm still his friend but I won't be as close anymore. I then repeatedly asked him why he did it and each time I asked, he responded with \"idk\". Before leaving, he tells me that he has no intention to making things back to the way it used to be and he has no reason why he wants it like that.\n\nNow that entire conversation with him has been so confusing and so hurtful that even now I don't understand why he did that. I didn't do anything bad to him yet he practically cuts me off and talks to me as if I'm a boring bio teacher. I am no longer of any value towards him and I just feel so much pain and suffering. What's even worse is that this only applies to me. To everyone else, he's still the happy and caring T that I used to know so it hurts like hell when he has fun with others yet he hates being near me. \n\nIn a normal situation, I would cut him off completely and find a new friend but the thing is, he has been there with me for so long and we were so close. I've grown to need him and to be wanted by him. I desperately want him back as my close good friend. I tried talking to him starting convos with him but everytime someone he knows passes, one hundred percent of his attention goes to that person instead (which ends up hurting me even more). \n\nI need help because I don't know what to do anymore, I don't want to let him go and I really just want things to be how they used to be. Everyday that passes knowing that he is pushing me away is killing a part of me. I'm literally having trouble sleeping because of this situation.\n\nPlease, can someone tell me what I can do? I'm completely lost at what I can do.\n\n", "subreddit": "lonely"}

After that I got tired of just being lonely. I looked in the mirror and hated seeing the same guy she broke the heart of. I started lifting harder, and got a drastic haircut. But that wasn't enough. She was the last girl I kissed and shared a bed with, and that wasn't the same for her a mere days after we split. So I got on Tinder, and had a couple hookups, one of which I'm currently fwb with. We don't have anything in common other than that we're sexually attracted to each other.

If they think you are a risk to yourself, you get shoved into a hospital for an evaluation. Those places are terrible.

I have people I can talk to, close friends, yet I feel lonely and inadequate. I don't like talking to my in real life friends about stuff going in my head, I like being to myself. Believe it or not, I'm a positive person and happy most days but I feel like too much of my socializing (in real life) is driving me crazy. I hate when people are Debbie Downers or constantly making self-depreciating jokes because it can become toxic to others around them who may not be able to joke about that stuff. I want to make people happy themselves and so far I'm able to make everyone laugh or smile temporarily. I want to be isolated, do my own thing but there's one thing dragging me behind and that one thing is that loneliness. Does that make sense? There's a difference between loneliness and being alone. I want to be able to be isolated with one person for a short time throughout the day. I'm able to make friends relatively easily with my humor but finding that someone to be alone with is especially challenging. At 21, I feel as though I'll never find my dream relationship with someone. I constantly tell my friends when they're down about relationships that someone is out there for them, there always is, but I don't feel that way for myself. When I feel that connection with someone, I'm immediately put to the side or friendzoned. I sound like such a \"nice girl\" saying that, but I don't know what I'm doing wrong. I thought I mastered socializing but it seems like I only mastered being that \"funny friend.\" I don't like dating casually, or dating in general, you never know what people are looking for and people are too scared to be upfront with their feelings whereas I'm extremely straight forward. I don't want this someone I can be isolated with next door, I want them to be somewhere around the world but it seems impossible to find. I hope today being alone studying in the library will distract me from these feelings but there's only a month left of distractions before I'm thrown into summer with no one and nothing to distract me from it.

I'm older so I understand why and don't have a problem with it but the same thing happened when I was younger. Supervisor was from another store. My coworker and I both met them at the beginning of our shifts for the first time. By the end of the night the supervisor was asking my coworker to hang out outside of work to become a friend. I was never asked. Like I said, both are younger than me and in this example I understand. Even when I was younger I was never invited out by coworkers. At best, my coworkers tolerate me.

When I was younger I was physically and emotionally abused alongside my younger brother. This happened periodically from the time I was about eight to when I was about thirteen when I finally decided that enough was enough and told someone. These abusive periods were mixed in between times that I would be told I was supposedly being \"good\", However would very quickly shift back into the abuse with next to no context. Looking back now on the events it makes a lot of the stupid thought processes I have even to this day make a lot more sense. It's hard to imagine my younger self trying to figure out what I had done wrong that deserved being hit, along with many other awful things, and what all I would have to do to go back to being what they considered \"good\", however that did eventually come to an end.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhen I was sixteen my father committed suicide. I don't really know what to say from that. I was never really as close with my father as I was and currently am with my mother. It hurts me even to this day to think about what he did and how much I miss him, Don't get me wrong... But sometimes I feel guilty that I don't miss him as much as if it was my mother who did it instead... I love him very dearly and I feel ashamed to openly admit this now, but beating myself up with my thoughts does me no good either.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAfter my father passed I did a year of homeschooling. During this time we lived in the country so my options to go out were very limited, On top of my lack of friends. Every single day was nothing but me thinking terrible terrible thoughts, an entire year of near isolation. Looking back on it now I am very surprised I didn't self harm, Let alone take my own life. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThat brings me to now. Like I said these are a very \"readers digest\" of events because I don't want to sit here and write a novel, but at the same time my brain feels that if I write vague statements of events then maybe I will feel magically better because... idk that's how my thoughts work. For the first time in a very long time I do not think that I am depressed. I have come to accept my past as something that has happened and nothing can ever change it and I like to think that I am a stronger person for surviving this far. Sometimes it helps me to imagine people who face worse things and that makes me thankful that it was only these things that happened to me. Now I'm just very lonely and lacking social skills. I don't think I am ugly or unlikable or anything like that. I suppose I am just an average young adult. I just want some people to play games with or just have some companionship in general. People always talk about how this is supposed to be the best time of someones life but all I can think about is how boring and lonely it is. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nYaaaaaayyy feelings dump. If I am honest I don't really know what the goal of this was. Maybe a cry for help in the form of friendship, Or maybe it was just an attempt to dump my feelings that I don't want to think about any longer on some small corner of the internet. I promise I'm not super weird. This is just my unfortunate portions of my life that helped shape who I am. I think everyone faces times like this.

But the truth is that they don't care about me in the same way I care about them. I was very committed to them, doing them favours, giving them gifts and for their family too, compromising, making an effort to be happy despite my constant low mood, making an effort to be more forward with activities.  They're always biting off more than they can chew. Example: I read and reviewed my friend's entire fantasy novel that I didn't even like because fantasy isn't my genre, and she knew about this. Meanwhile, she can't even read a 1200 single chapter despite promising she'll do it week after week after week. It's always something like that with my friends. I know they're busy just like everyone else, but my god, if they know they can't stay committed why do they keep making false promises??!!

It's not too bad of a dependance right now, I hold down a decent job and most of my life is in good order, but I can see that changing as time goes on. \n\nMy issue is, the friend group I hang out with are extremely heavy drinkers, our weekend always consists of going to the pub and getting absolutely shit face drunk. They aren't interested in changing, having spoken to them a bit. Nor should they if thats what they want to do. This feels like its destroying my productivity and holding me back to some degree and I'm beginning to realise I have to create some distance, but I'm terrified of kind of leaving the group and becoming a relatively lonely person. Unfortunately, my life up until about 5 years ago was spend distancing myself from most people I grew up with, meaning I'm fairly estranged to all my childhood peers, just got these friends I met in adulthood, at university mostly. \n\nMaybe this sounds stupid, and sorry if it seems trivial, I just hate being by myself, and am scared that if I stop going to bars and getting hammered for my health concerns, then I will be by myself a fair amount. \n\nJ", "subreddit": "lonely"}

And then she tore into me again, but this time it was so much worse. she basically just said we should just stop talking and i said i loved her and she literally said \u201cok cool.\u201d and then i asked her if we would ever make things right. and she called me a scumbag. the last thing she said to me was \u201cfuck you, you fucking retard i hate you\u201d and that was it. i miss her so much. i literally feel so fucking alone and no one cares about me. i\u2019ve been sifting through omegle to numb the pain but it\u2019s not working anymore. i just want somebody.\n\ntldr: a girl who i loved and who loved me randomly started hating me and now we stopped talking but it hurts so fucking much. i need something to numb the pain.", "subreddit": "lonely"}
{"post_id": "b7t6ik", "created_utc": 1554068514, "title": "I legitimately have no friends. Not even an exaggeration.", "author": "anotherthrowawayan", "self_text": "As a child, I had struggled with English as I was a child of Korean  immigrants who didn\u2019t teach me English, despite them having raised my sister in America before me. Along with struggle with language, I was a child with psychological issues. Teachers had constantly prescribed therapist after therapist, and it was no help. However, by seventh grade it had dissipated somewhat. But in eighth grade, I was a violent kid. Bullying towards me in seventh grade had me bitter, and as a kid who had a whole sleuth of different mental issues since he was a child, I did not respond well as I went into eight grade. Due to violence in multiple incidents throughout the year, my parents had decided to force me into an online high school. I\u2019m in eleventh grade now, and there has been an insane amount of things that have happened in between, but to sum it up, I\u2019m not violent anymore, I have dissipated my anger issues, yet I have been continuously depressed for over four years, and have continuously had OCD since I can remember. I\u2019ve improved myself a lot, I\u2019d like to think. I go to the gym, I get straight A\u2019s, and I\u2019ve tried my best to become the most compassionate human being I can be. But the problem is that, it\u2019s been three years I\u2019ve been in an online high school, and I have absolutely no friends. Sure, I never really had any \u201cfriends\u201d throughout my school years, but I legitimately have no friends now. Hoping to make some, I recently joined a youth orchestra for the state.  Well, actually, I joined for this one girl I have liked since I played in this orchestra three years ago. However, it is only making me more miserable as I am unable to talk to anyone, especially as I know absolutely no one in the orchestra except for that girl I like who doesn\u2019t give a shit about me. I can swear at my past self for a lot of things, but I was outgoing and had the guts to talk to people back then. Now, I\u2019m a pessimistic festering ball of anxiety and loneliness and I am unable to start a conversation with anyone, although I am able to carry a conversation that is put upon me. I often feel that me trying to improve myself is pointless.  I find myself always waiting for this weekly orchestra, despite going and feeling miserable. My main problem is my obsession with this girl. I\u2019ve never had a girlfriend, and I\u2019ve become desperate. I\u2019m a stocky dude who\u2019s not extremely fit, but I\u2019m not fat, and I\u2019m relatively muscular, although I admit that I\u2019m slightly pudgy. However, I don\u2019t think I\u2019m too ugly for this girl I like to like me. However, she sits in the front and is a violinist, and I\u2019m a cellist who fucked up his audition because he doesn\u2019t care about this stupid fucking orchestra, so I sit near the back. I can\u2019t find any opportunity to talk to her, or rather, I can\u2019t find a situation where I would be forced to talk to her. Along with that, I\u2019m losing hope that I would make any waves if I did talk to her, as she clearly doesn\u2019t give a shit about me. Despite staring at her a lot as I\u2019m a creepy asshole who likes her, I notice that she never ever stares in my direction. It\u2019s amazing how much I don\u2019t matter to her. Life is fucking terrible. I apologize for any mistakes in grammar I have made. Please forgive me, as I have just finished another youth symphony session and want to die. ", "subreddit": "lonely"}
{"post_id": "b7t6jl", "created_utc": 1554068518, "title": "Having standards makes it easier to find someone", "author": "Kind_and_Strict", "self_text": "I'm not forever alone, but I frequent this subreddit to talk and listen to people.  I first of all want to say I love you guys and I know how much it hurts.  I occasionally share thoughts and experiences about stuff that's worked for me, recognizing that it probably won't work for most people.  So I want to put forth the idea that being more selective in your dating preferences can be a really good thing.  I'd love to hear what you guys think.\n\nI wrote this from the perspective of men seeking women since that's most people on here, but I think it applies pretty well to anyone seeking any gender.  \n\nIf you're very lonely, you might have a mentality like \"I need to constantly be on the lookout for any single women who I am not physically repulsed by, and see if I can have a chance with them.\"  You might have a very urgent sense that you need to take whatever you can get, and fast.\n\nI'd say this is a bad way to go for two reasons.  First, women are pretty good at picking up on desperation.  As well as when a guy is looking for *someone*, *anyone*.  They're good at it because they've been dealing with it since middle school.  It's a huge turnoff.  \n\nAnother, less obvious reason why this is a bad idea.  Do you really think you have picked up on every single opportunity to be with a woman who would have been interested in you, and taken that chance?  Do you really think your brain has detected every conceivable opportunity to escape your loneliness?  The world is really complex.  People's actions and motivations are really complex.  We don't quite perceive reality objectively; our brains are constantly filtering out and zoning in on different information.  You are gonna have an extra hard time if you're running around aimlessly, ready to latch on to anything that resembles an escape from your sadness.\n\nSo what should you do?  Narrow your search.  Decide what kind of person you're looking for.  Decide what kind of person you're not looking for.  Not a big fan of social media?  Don't bother messaging people for whom it's a big part of their life.  Don't like mild to moderate attention seeking behavior from women?  Seek out people who are more reserved.    \n\nIt's counterintuitive, because it seems like your odds are just becoming slimmer.  And sometimes they definitely are, like if you're a woman and you decide \"I won't be with a man under 6 ft\" or you're a man and you only want to date supermodels.  \n\nBut it can actually improve your odds.  If you know what kind of person you want to attract, you can start developing yourself in a way that you are comfortable with, and that might be attractive towards that kind of person.  Do you want to be with someone who is quiet and intellectual?  Read more books, find people to discuss your ideas with.  Do you want to be with someone who takes care of themselves and takes physical fitness seriously?  Get serious at the gym, maybe pick up a fitness hobby where you can get involved with people.    Who knows, you might meet someone during your journey of self development (although as I mentioned, women can smell desperation and if you join a group primarily for the purpose of looking for a romantic partner, you probably will be found out).\n\nThe cool thing about doing this is that not only are you more easily able to perceive potential connections with women, you will also be more attractive to women this way.  Just as women find it unattractive when an aimless and purposeless man sets his sights on her, they tend to find it more attractive when a man knows what he wants and isn't willing to settle for less.", "subreddit": "ForeverAlone"}
