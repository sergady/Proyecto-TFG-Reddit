I haven't been able to even partly master my passion, and I'll be thrusted into the adult world quite soon.

He hasn't heard the end of it, and that was nearly a year ago. My mother called it \"pathetic\". I couldn't handle that. I truly couldn't.

Minimum wage (in New York State, as of 2019) is $11.50 before taxes. That's pretty good for minimum wage, but even that isn't enough to live off of. A one bedroom apartment is usually around $1,500-$2,000 or more, from what I know at least. Minimum wage only provides a little over $1000 per month, and even that might be a bit of a stretch. My facts may incorrect, and please correct me if they are, but if what I say is indeed true, then I can't even have a bummy job and a bummy home. Remember, I didn't count food cost, health insurance, car insurance, etc. So, it's either homeless, or a laughing stock and disappointment to my family. Both are essentially the same, though. \n\nThe next reason is that I'll essentially be alone. My only closest friend (who is like a brother to me) will be going into the airforce for nearly a decade right after highschool. Besides that, all I'll have is my family, and I already described how they'll most likely treat me. I haven't a significant other, which depresses me every day, and I haven't many friends. I'll be, virtually, completely alone. My mental health is fragile as is, but enduring even more isolation, alienation, loneliness, and depression than I already do will shatter me.

She was persistent and at first it got on my nerves but soon we eventually became best friends. We went to different high schools but we still talked to each other everyday until some time near the end of freshman year. She would start leaving me one word texts and evading my phone calls and not really texting me back. Not too long after this started, it began to feel like she was ghosting me. \n\nI was extremely devastated as this was my only decent human connection that I thought I could sustain forever. Months went by and we barely spoke to each other, I saw her post pictures of her new friends and I saw her refer to them as her best friends and it was like she had forgot about me. There were times where I would curl up in ball on my bed and just cry and ask myself \u201cwhat did I do wrong?\u201d I was completely alone...again. \n\nAfter a really long while, I finally got over it. I got used to not talking to her all the time and finally didn\u2019t care. I finally accepted that we just grew apart and moved on with my very lonely life. But somewhere during the summer between sophomore and junior year, I started hearing from her again and she suddenly wanted to hang out with me more. Obviously, I\u2019m very confused as it felt like she made it a point to cut me off not too long ago but I accepted. It\u2019s been almost 4 years since she out of no where decided that we\u2019re friends again.\n\nI\u2019m the type of person that when you do something like this that hurts me deeply and I finally get over it, I\u2019m done with you emotionally.  Yeah I forgive her for pretty much ghosting me for about 2 years then popping up out of no where and yeah we now hang out every now and then but she\u2019s no longer and will never be a priority in my life anymore. Before, she was all I thought about, all I ever wanted to hang out with, I would constantly put her happiness before mine and at that point in time, she was the most important thing. As I said before, I suck at peopling so the fact that I even made a friend was so great that I felt I had to do anything to maintain it even at my own expense. Now, I realize that she wasn\u2019t all that great as a friend and that she only really hung out with me because she was bored and not because I was her friend. \n\nToday, she only hangs out with me when she\u2019s bored and she talks shit about me to her more important friends and thinks I don\u2019t know. She\u2019s kind of horrible and she treats me like an after thought. Last year at a combined nontraditional high school senior prom, she ditched me after only half and hour for her more important friends. She\u2019s also dating my ex( I legit don\u2019t care as I often forget we were even together) but tries to rub it in my face. \n\nShe sucks as a person kind of but I don\u2019t usually try to make a big deal out of the dumb shit she does because as I said before, she\u2019s not a priority and I don\u2019t think about her like I used to anymore but recently, she\u2019s just been all over the place and it\u2019s been driving me insane. \n\nWhat really gets me though, is how she\u2019ll go on and on about how *SHE\u2019S* always forgotten and how *SHE* has no one when she literally ghosted me for 2 years, ditched me at prom for her more important friends and she constantly disregards *MY* feelings but ok. Go off I guess. I also don\u2019t have *ANY* friends and I literally mean *NONE*. I\u2019ve been feeling really insignificant and super unimportant and lonely for a while now, but I\u2019d rather feel like this than have her as a \u201cfriend\u201d.\n\nShe makes me feel even more alone than I actually am and she\u2019s making it 10 times more frustrating to cope with me already being completely lonely enough.", "subreddit": "lonely"}

I was at work and a girl came up to be helped. She was in a formal dress probably for something related to graduation. She looked around 18 so probably half my age. Obviously I know to never look at a woman for too long because that's considered creepy. While she was around 18, this happens with other women. She went up to me, I saw her, what she was wearing even though it was a common formal outfit, and I couldn't look at her. I'm not saying I couldn't stare at her because that would be creepy. I'm saying I couldn't even look at her while helping her. I stared at my computer acting like I was trying to fix something because I couldn't look at her. I tried but as soon as I made eye contact, these thoughts that I could almost hear saying you're a creep, ew, don't look at her, you're a perv, stop making her uncomfortable, and other thoughts were screaming at me. I had to look away. A thought that was a voice said, good, don't creep her out you ugly loser was the response from my own head. I was about to have a panic attack when she left. I almost screamed stop torturing me to myself. My co-worker saw how I was acting and asked what was wrong. I said, nothing, I was just trying to fix something. \n\nThis isn't an isolated incident. A few days ago the day before Memorial Day which is the first weekend most pools around here open, a young woman came in a bathing suit with a towel wrapped around her. I would say late teens or early 20's. She came in with a couple of friends who were in regular clothes. I couldn't look at the woman in the towel. It wasn't even revealing but for some reason my mind would not let me even look at her because it's part of my job to make eye contact with people. \n\nThese thoughts are lines people have used on me in the past. My autistic personality has creeped mostly women out. Some were vocal about it. Sometimes it's from my sister who bullied me for almost my entire childhood. I know people will tell me I need help but from who? Therapists at best will just tell me that either I'm letting other people from my past take over my present personality or that it's some kind of PTSD which one therapist said was from my childhood. It wasn't much of a problem until I gave up trying to meet women a few years ago. It's gotten worse and I can't control it. People will tell me to get myself under control but it's difficult when those thoughts take over. I'm so scared of being a creep, it's causing me to not allow myself to even look at certain women. It doesn't happen with guys. I don't know exactly what's wrong with me but I'm very messed up. I wish help was out there but it's not. I don't know what to do. When I get home from work sometimes I have panic attacks due to those thoughts. I know some people will tell me to stop being paranoid or to man up but my mind is damaged from all the years of being FA and being rejected sometimes in a bad way. Maybe if I had a few successes, things would be different because I would have those successes to think about when I would get those negative thoughts. The problem is, I've never had any success. I wish I could just be able to stop having those thoughts. FA and the symptoms of FA have caused me to become this way. I'm not saying I'm entitled to a woman or anything similar. I'm just saying what my experiences have done to me. \n\nTl;dr FA destroyed me.", "subreddit": "ForeverAlone"}

It was up on the second floor balcony. The sounds were what I noticed first as I rounded the corner. All the music and the thumping and cheering that comes with the gathering of 20-30-something-year-olds. \n\nAs I opened the gate I looked up and saw well dressed people holding full glasses and smiling. One of these shiny people might have glanced down at me but I might have imagined it. It was almost like that eerie feeling of looking at a very famous and beautiful painting in a museum. \n\nI was coming back home from the liquor store (admittedly preparing for a night of grim introspection) when this happened. How odd, though, to stare at a group of people both so close and yet so distant.\n\nAny one of them I could reach out to and ask: \"How are you? What are you thinking right now? What's your name?\"\n\nAnd the scary thing is they might answer and I'd be trapped like a rogue cell. Dividing and multiplying like so much social math.\n\nBut... Maybe the shiny people up there on that second floor balcony are like me, maybe we are all like each other; trying to stay afloat in this overly crowded public swimming pool.\n\nBut... Maybe if I nod at someone, smile at them, say hello, they might smile back.\n\n\"I see you! You are there and I am here! We are both alive and the world can be beautiful if you let it!\"\n\nBut... Maybe, and this is a stretch, maybe you and I have seen each other on the street, in a coffee shop, at a bar, or as I was crossing the street one day.\n\nMaybe you nodded to me and smiled as we walked past each other. Maybe you made me smile.\nAnd maybe this life isn't as fucked up and tragic as it appears.\n\nBut for now, I'm drinking alone again underneath the party upstairs.\n\nGood night, friend.

I met this girl 3 years ago at work, neither of us work there any longer. We have hung out every couple months.

This scared me enough that I started reaching to this friend to hangout more and talk more. We have become really good friends in the past few months.\n\nBecause she is my only friend I'm afraid of losing her and not having her in my life. I am fine when with her, but start getting anxiety when I'm alone. My texts to her start getting needing if I don't feel I am getting the kind of connection that I am wanting.\n\nShe went on vacation a few days ago. The day before she went on vacation we were supposed to hangout and she had forgotten and didn't have time anymore. This really hurt and I told her so. She apologized and I forgave her and then I apologized for being so needing recently. I haven't heard from her and I haven't contacted her since. I know it's only been a couple days and she is on vacation, but I'm still freaking out thinking she's never going to talk to me again.\n\nWeekends are really hard on me and this one especially as I usually hangout with this friend for a bit. During the week I have work to occupy my mind some of the time and a little bit of social interaction from coworkers, but nowhere near enough. I have heavy social anxiety that I'm working on, but I'm not to the point where I can just start up a conversation with some random person. I don't know what my interests are because I've spent the last 25 years doing nothing but playing video games (stopped completely a few months ago). I don't have any pets. I haven't spoken with my dad in years and he doesn't talk much to begin with. Working through some things with my mom so we're not really talking right now and even when we did there just didn't seem to be a real connection. \n\nIt's hard to make friends when depressed.

We started messaging on console putting a x on the end of messages, we told each other our real first names (she said my name was cute and that I have a nice voice) and things and it was nice, we played this game together and had fun you know but one day she asks if I have Snapchat and I didn't but she says I should get it so I said sure, we then sort of agree to send each other a picture of ourselves on Snapchat the next day which I was super nervous about because I don't usually take pictures of myself but she says she doesn't judge or anything and we both joked about how we're ugly and we're both saying how we doubt that things like that, so I'm like cool but to my surprise she sends me her picture after we go off console that night and she's you know attractive and there's a nice message attached to the picture so I decide to send her one of me that night too and I feel something of a connection to her..... \n\nAnd I dno maybe I'm imagining it but I just felt this connection cut out when she replied to that picture of me, like the day before she messaged me on console if I was home so we could play but the day after that picture exchange there was no such message and I suddenly felt like I was I dno chasing after her and bothering her to play with me or something, she doesn't reply to me on Snapchat, just looks at the message and that's it and the cute messages on console have just kinda stopped and I'm going to be honest, this hurts a surprising amount because I always told my best friend (who has a girlfriend) that I'm not actively looking for a girlfriend like I'm not on dating sites or anything, I'm just waiting to meet the right person no rush which I truly believed....

My \"friends\" (girls primarily) make me feel lonely because they're dismissive and often when I want to talk about my mental struggles they get really awkward. My boyfriends never judged me like that for it. It was okay to be lonely or to need to talk to someone every day. I don't even know what my girl friends do every day, but it sure isn't hanging out with me. Because of this dichotomy I've been stuck in multiple relationships that weren't serving me, but they were giving me the help with this constant loneliness I otherwise feel. I'm not sure why it's so different. Maybe it's because in romantic relationships I have more reassurance that the guy won't leave (but they do), or maybe girls are just cattier? I'm at a loss to explain this and to deal with it accordingly. I meet interesting women sometime that seem nice, but they seem like they don't need any more friends.

Although I'm socially awkward and have the social abilities of a 2 yo, I'm a funny and kind guy, but nobody seems to notice me. Since I started school I've never had a real friend just \"buddies\". Kids in elementary kinda hated me for some reason. In high school I've found my place and my classmates are awesome and it's the best class ever, but I still feel like I'm alone. In recess I always see them socialise and talk and laugh, and there's noone I can do this with. Also in most classes I sit alone because everyone else is sitting with someone, and if I'm sitting with someone it's because there are not enough places. Noone ever told me happy bday irl or on Facebook(yes not even once), but always see them tell each other. My mental health is a mess since I was about 9-10 yo I've had panic attacks because of death, and after followed depression. I was bullied a lot and being a very sensitive child(both physically and emotionally) just made them worse (this was until high school started). Recently I had surgery and only one person texted me on Facebook if I was okay(out of 33 classmates), and they all knew I was having surgery. And finally there's a girl in my class I love. She's smart, beautiful and just the perfect girl for me. I always make her laugh and we're always having a good time. But she has a bf and the fact is I don't really know him at all. I'm not jealous, I'm sad, disappointed and just angry at myself for thinking I would interest her. I'm kinda happy though because she seems happy with him. \n\nIf you've read it all, thank you.

She pecked me on the lips afterwards before she left and hardly a week later she decided she liked some other guy... but that fucked me up a lot. Without going into my whole life story I had a shitty time in High School and got sent to a private school in 9th grade for being late all the time and for sleeping in class. I even had to attend COURT for truancy. It was fucking stupid. I got put in at least 4 psych ward stays against my will and it traumatized me so much that I even still have nightmares about being held against my will. I fell in love with a girl I met online at  16 who became my best friend and she actually lived relatively close to me, so it seemed like it was a real possibility we could be together.\n\nI won't go into all of the details but basically she lead me on and told me she would date me when she was ready to date again. She wanted to be single for a while and I can respect that; but she became more and more distant from me as time went by and aside from the feelings her and I were awesome friends. She's probably the best friend I've ever even had... which is what makes all of it such a pain. I know after all this time that she doesn't feel the same way but it still hurt a lot being lead on and told that I had a chance to be with her. She told me herself that she would date me when she was ready to date people again and it hurt a lot when she told me she was seeing somebody else now. I know I'm not the most desirable person or the most attractive but I felt like I legitimately had a chance with her based on what she had told me and to find out otherwise despite expecting as much still fucking stings. I put all my eggs in one basket though and that's my own fault. It's just so hard when you feel so strongly towards a single person and I wish I could feel that way about somebody else but it's just not something you can do just because you want to; it's  a natural thing that develops when you really like someone and it's impossible to control.... which I eventually learned; much to my own dismay.\n\nAfter all of this I don't think I will ever find mutual love -- but deep down I know that's just my feelings talking. I still want to feel love from someone I love, but that much feels like a fairy tale right now. Fellow FAs who have had their hearts broken; how do you deal with it?

Also I'm on mobile so sorry about the format.\n\nI felt like this would be the best place to share my feelings. I have spoken to family, but there is only so much support they can give. I'm not really sure how this could be replied to. Mods, delete this thread if you want. I just need somewhere to pour my feelings.\n\nI feel deeply lonely. My heart stings. I'm a 16 yr male and find it very difficult to make friends. I'm diagnosed with tourettes syndrome and ADHD, and find it hard to interact without getting too hyper and seeming strange, or not getting involved enough.\n\nI do not click well with other teenage males. I have 2 friends; both male and my age. One is an online friend who is very accepting and laid-back, and I praise him for that. The other is a classmate with autism, which I have 'experience' with as my younger brother and primary school friend also have/had autism, plus we share an interest in gaming. All other males, I struggle with. I'm not sure what it is, but I always feel very alienated around most of them. As for girls... except for family, I have not spoken to a girl face to face in about 3-4 YEARS. While I am in the mood for a relationship (just for comfort and cuddles, I'm rather asexual), I don't have many options and feel lost as for where to hunt friends. I don't see people I can see myself communicating with, and those I do often feel out of my league.\n\nI don't go to mainstream school; there are only 3 girls in my class, all of whom I fail to connect with. They aren't my type, to keep things simple. Besides the one I mentioned earlier, the boys are worse and have dabbled with things like drugs.\n\nFamily are wonderful, but I don't think they solely can fulfill the hole in me. My parents are amazing; understanding and wonderful. My sisters play Mario kart or poker or whatever, and that's great. My little brother games with me. But I don't think its enough. I cant bug family to constantly spend time with me 24/7, and I'm starting to get bored of spending all day playing Skyrim, or any game. I don't go out to bars or whatever; not really the outgoing type. My classmate isn't either so we don't hang out outside of class. There are places to go, people to meet, and things to see. But I don't feel involved.\n\nMaybe I'm just overreacting. It could be the boring half term or the GCSES getting to my head, or the horrible hot summer air. But I fear that things can only get worse. What if there are no girls i like in my course next year? What if I don't make any new friends and only isolate myself further? What if the friends I have now drift away?\n\nIf you read the whole thing, thanks for caring. I mean it. Really. I'm glad there's a safe haven where I can ask anonymous strangers for advice and where to look for more to do with myself. Whatever your reply is, knowing that people are reading this makes it all hurt a little less. Who knows, maybe next year I'll meet the perfect one. Or even just some people that are \"good enough\".    I should probably stop spilling now. I just don't know how much longer I can wait.\n\nThank you so much\n\n\nGerbil :)", "subreddit": "lonely"}

And haven\u2019t had an appetite or even got enjoyment from music (!! \ud83d\ude22) or anything.. And so on. I think being so used to loneliness \u2013 combined with being depressed \u2013 makes it seem like it\u2019s not as bad as it is; that I\u2019m not. But it is. And I am. And I think I\u2019m beginning to see that more now \u2013 not that I know if that\u2019s a good thing yet, necessarily, however! Ha, \u2018cause right now, it\u2019s all looking like it\u2019s too much for me, in truth. I\u2019m just drowning in overwhelmedness, y\u2019know? I feel both too depressed to cry and, yet also, almost physically paining from the sadness. I\u2019m, too, totally restless \u2013 don\u2019t have the concentration or patience for essentially anything. It\u2019s hard to be present, and I have been smoking weed to distract myself too \u2013 I dunno what else to do, really! At least it passes the time. But, of course, I know that that\u2019s not ideal or helpful etc. also. \n\nemm, to the point of the post though! haha. Well, I started chatting with another Redditor I found through one of those \u201cmake a friend\u201d sort o\u2019 groups. We lived in the same country! Both of us loved arcades, Veronica Mars and Studio Ghibli. Same mbti type (lol) and we were both struggling existentially as well. And that was kinda the plan, it seemed \u2013 we would drink some beer, play air hockey and talk about being depressed and our existential crises! haha. And, y\u2019know what, I was really looking forward to it? It was the first time in months something happened that made me even a little happy; that I had something to look forward to; a possible friend! I have no friends here at all. Furthermore, the few I have at home in my own country, I can\u2019t talk to them about my mental state or matters of existence. Or be comfortable sharing my feelings and problems with them, sadly. So to find someone that I could already talk to so openly, someone who seemed really cool, someone who seemed a bit like me.. was, for me, quite something! It just came out of nowhere \u2013 I hadn\u2019t even known those friend subreddits existed! \u2013 it felt too good to be true, almost. But then again, I thought, maybe, I deserved a break for once too? \n\nBut anyway.. the fearing (and foreseeing, even?) that this potential new friend would just disappear or not reply or we\u2019d never meet or something, in the end, proved true! That this would go bad like everything else. And it did, very sadly and confusingly. I clicked on the chat thread thing, a while ago tonight, and noticed that they\u2019d deleted their account. Just like that! And it really hurt, to be honest. My life is bad enough as is. So to then, potentially, find a friend with the same personality type as me, some of the same experiences and interests, someone who I instantly felt at ease with and like they really got me.. and just have it ripped away from me like that.. really hurts. :( \n\nIt was tough and scary enough, in my current state, to even reply to their post that first day! So for this to happen now is pretty crushing. And it\u2019s worse since it feels nearly inevitable? Like I knew it was coming \u2013 I was almost expecting them not to reply or to delete their account without saying anything, despite getting on so well. I don\u2019t know.. I really needed a break in life; I really needed a friend too. And then this happens, of course.. My anxiety disorder of the social kind is, I know (!!), gonna hound me about this for a while to come \u2013 torturing myself over what I mighta said wrong or whatever. uggghh! Y\u2019know? And, every time and day, it just gets harder to try in general.

This sounds very appealing to me. The problem here though is you have to find a Catholic woman to date, and this is easier said than done.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI go to many Catholic young adult functions to meet a bunch of people. I introduce myself to everyone. I've made many friends, but I've never got a girlfriend out of any of this. Most of the girls either already have a boyfriend, are too old, or are not interested. Mind you, I've only ever asked one out in person and another I had a big crush on and was too timid at the time (I've changed since to be significantly more bold) to ask her out and both weren't interested. The worst though is Catholic dating sites which seem to exist only to make you depressed as fucking hell. I've literally messaged every single girl within 150 miles from where I live thats around my age (about 5 year max difference) and literally not a single date ever came from it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI don't know. I feel my childhood fucked me in the ass big time. I was homeschooled after causing trouble and bullying kids in kindergarten and first grade so my parents gave up dealing with the principal and homeschooled me to graduation. My parents did a mediocre job and I had basically zero social interaction when I was a kid. I missed out on so much stuff that I never learned how to flirt, or get a girlfriend. I also have no childhood friends as a result.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI feel like I've gotten dealt a bad hand of cards, and I got two jokers that were accidentally shuffled into a game of poker. All I want is a companion in life. I don't really care about sexual stuff as much as someone close to share life with. Fuck my life\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEdit: I should say that I do know how to flirt but I don't know if it's flirting. I feel like I'm busting girls balls by teasing them when they fuck shit up and it makes them laugh. I'm a big joker and I make jokes out of everything because I see everything as a big fucking joke. Sometimes I think girls are attracted to me because I hear if they play with their hair they like you, but I doubt it cuz I'm ugly AF", "subreddit": "ForeverAlone"}

Figuratively speaking, she lifted the rock up, peaked inside and said hi. Anyway, you all know about that feeling, from fantasy or experience or movies or all three.

I had a bad day again and wish I had a woman to come home to. I wish I had a friend to have a drink with. I wish I had a family who didn't constantly make fun of me and call me a loser. This story was from high school. I was constantly being bullied as I've said and my neighbor who was in the same grade said that I needed to shave my head because it would cause me to become more attractive especially to girls. I was desperate and despite his history of also bullying me, at the time he was being nice. A few days before we went to a store to get something and he gave me money then said to buy condoms for him. There is no age limit on condoms so I bought them and gave them to him. He was talking about having sex with girls. We both were either 16 or 17 and he was having a normal social life. He said he would shave my head for me. My hair was and still is the only attractive thing about me. \n\nHe shaved my head and at the end I looked terrible. My hair may have been too long and I didn't maintenance it enough but it still looked good on me. After he was done shaving my head, he started laughing but said it was because I looked different but it wasn't a bad thing. \n\nThe next day I went into school and everyone who knew I existed looked at me and laughed. I remember during a class and the entire class was laughing at me. That hurt but seeing my crush looking at her friend, then me, and turning back towards each other laughing hurt the most. In every class all the kids laughed at me. They laughed at me on the bus. I wanted to never go to school again but obviously I had to. Over the next few days I would get insulted almost every class about my shaved head. My friend never admitted it but I think he just wanted to pull a prank on me using my low self-esteem against me and shaved it to get the laughs. \n\nI will never be able to forget that first day. Eventually my hair grew back but instead of making me more attractive, it made me the joke of the school. I remember trying different looks in high school but they didn't change anything. You can't change ugly and autistic. I never allowed anyone to shave the top of my head again except for a couple of times where they weren't using the razor to shave my head like my friend did. When I get a haircut now, I still tell the guy to only use a razor on the side and in the back when he's cutting my hair. I only want scissors to cut the top and leave it longer than the rest. \n\nAnyone else have something similar happen to them? \n\nTl;dr, friend shaved my head in high school and everyone laughed at me making me feel even worse about myself.", "subreddit": "ForeverAlone"}

But it's helped me, and it's helped me get a bit nearer to normie territory. Perhaps it will help that I don't sugarcoat things. But please know that I don't mean to offend anyone.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* Does everyone deserve love? By my philosophical standpoint: yes. Will everyone get love? Absolutely not. There is obviously a lack of love in this world, therefore we have to give it with caution. And by that I mean that people should be careful about giving love to those who won't accept it, would throw it back in our face, betray us, and continue to be a toxic person and waist our energy. You have to make some effort to become deserving of love i.e: not be a toxic person, don't ruin yourself with drugs and alcohol, accept and be grateful for help, and find little ways to pay someone back for their kindness.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* Continuing from my first point: please take care of yourself, so that you'll feel better in the end, and so people will see you as deserving of love. Don't develop destructive habits like video game/internet addiction, drug addiction, alcohol addiction, food addiction, smoking. Keep your place clean and organized. Shower regularly, take care of your appearance, choose outfits that compliment your body shape.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* If you have an addiction to anything, get it into your head that you have to stop it. Seek medical help if it is severe, but sometimes you can manage to stop it on your own. Alcohol and smoking addictions are hard to break, but it is not impossible and I've known people who broke the cycle, even cold turkey, and never picked them up again. Drug addiction, you'd probably need to go to rehab. Food addiction; it is one of the easiest addictions to stop and prevent from ever being picked up again if you realise that you actually have the problem. Science has proven that fatty/sugary foods mess with our brain by producing a high and low similar to drugs and cigarettes. Besides all the health consequences they cause, they make many people feel like crap when they're not taking it and slow, heavy and tired when they do take it. Healthier food gives you more energy, especially mentally. There are lots of techniques you can do to improve your diet, but I'm not going to go into that because there's already a lot of advice on the internet.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* Find hobbies and things to do. They'll make you feel energized, useful, worthy and they curb boredom. For suicidal, hopeless people especially, adopt a kitten or two from a shelter. They're cute and fun companions and you can't abandon them. Volunteer in animal shelters if you have the time. Donate to any shelters if you have stuff you don't need. Donate blood if you're eligible. Sign up to donate all your organs for when you die. Try doing an exercise routine or go to the gym and get good at running/weightlifting. If you can afford it try archery, hunting, fishing etc. Try to learn a new language via internet and Duolingo. Learn how to cook, and if you know already, choose a bit more complicated recipes. Start keeping a diary with all your thoughts about life. Try to write a book; for me it's incredibly satisfying, almost like a high (though I've never taken any drugs) and it's like I'm giving something back to the world.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* Take measures to improve your living conditions and education. I'm not saying that rich or better educated people can't be FA, but it seems that lots of people who are have fewer qualifications and so can't improve their situation. You cannot get better in the same environment, doing the same things that made you sick in the first place. Do anything you can to improve your situation, whether that's moving to a place with lower rent, changing your outlook on life, going to therapy, or trying to further your education and qualifications by any means possible.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* Once you've used the previous tips, you've got a good chance at making a friend or getting a romantic relationship. If you're not in an educational institution it can be quite hard to make friends, but there's the gym, volunteer places, independent courses, online meet ups, online dating, and conventions. But the physical is obviously not enough. If your social skills suck, well you're probably not going to make friends unless you look up relevant tips ( r/socialskills) and do a bit of mental planning beforehand. And it's ok to do mental planning. In general, during the first hours of getting to know a person, it's very good to ask questions about them, but questions that aren't too personal. To go the extra mile and seem like a pleasing/entertaining person to talk to, that's more complicated and is heavily determined by how your mind works, which may not be compatible with everyone. I like to talk about everything, but usually subjects like history, philosophy, sociology, sciences, and it's worked for me only half the time. Because the other half of the time the people I encountered just weren't into any of that stuff and preferred to talk about more trivial things.", "subreddit": "ForeverAlone"}

Then along the track she tells me the guy is actually my best friend, and that is when everything just started going downhill. I knew i couldn't compete with my best friend, because he is great, and we both kept talking to this girl until eventually i decided to leave her, not too long later, my friend and the girl start dating. They always had problems, and i just thought that it wouldn't really last and then i could maybe start dating her. But that's the thing, i cant date my best friends ex! That's not what best friends do! And that just really hurts, but the things is my emotions are so strong for this girl that i don't think i can control myself to not date her. She even told me that if things didn't work out with them that she would date me, and i know that's bad too, you don't want to be second.\n\nI knew i needed to get over her, so, i blocked her, and then, i unblocked her. What did blocking do? Absolutely nothing, i was still head over heels for this girl, i just wanted to be with her 24/7. Recently i saw that she is actually quite toxic, even put me off a lot (or so i thought), so i told her that i didn't really have feelings for her anymore, and she was sad about that, then here come the feels again for her.\n\nYesterday, she sent me an image, she shouldn't of sent it, i didn't ask for it, but she did. AND ME BEING AN ABSOLUTE IDIOT I ASK FOR MORE, she sends more, and then i cant get enough, its like a drug. Then i start getting annoying and continue to ask, so she has been very cold to me, and i noticed that, i asked her whats wrong, she just said everything was fine. Eventually she cracks, and tells me she is a mad at me for continuing to ask even tho i knew she was in a relationship, and i just stop for a second, come to the realization that what i did was so wrong, i betrayed her and my friend and i told her, I'm scared i will never get over you, so now i have blocked her again and i just don't know what to do anymore.  \n\n\nEdit: It's just that I'm so alone, I just want someone so that i can do all these things with them, i envy all the people in relationships around me and it sucks, i feel like I've missed out on something, but the thing is i haven't, I'm still young, but all my life i haven't had some sort of relationship with someone and i don't know if i can. I'm so shy and it's so hard for me to talk to people and i thought this was gonna be my chance to have something, but i just messed it up like everything else.", "subreddit": "lonely"}

So then after the date wr met at school the next day and I couldnt hold it in myself anymore so I told her how I felt and she told me that she really likes me but we can never be more then just friends. A world broke inside of me. I didnt come out of my room for a whole day and I barely ate. My friends came over after my mother called them. They got me going for a long time. That time while I was recovering and that time was really like a roller coaster. One day I was really happy and on the other I wa sso sad I wanted to jump in front of a train. After half a year of forgetting there was another camp where we both got drunk and we held hands for like 10 seconds. That was the only night in my life I thought that I finally have a reason to live. But that was it. After a week and the camp had ended we went separate ways. But I still saw her at school every day. 1 month passed and she got together with a guy I was really close with earlier. And then I got so wasted I went to her place and her boyfriend was there. They came to the door I was standing there with tears in my eyes and asking for redemption. The boyfriend went in so that we could talk. I told her everything about rhat I fell in love with her and she told me that I am an obsessive asshole and that I am not good for anything so then she slapped me. After that. I went to a shop and bought more alchohol and got so drunk a group of homeless people attacked me and robbed me. The next morning I woke up at home... She found me and she called my mother. I saw her in the morning sitting at the end of my bed hoping that everything would be alright. Me, lying in the bed half naked with huge bruises on my head I told her. \"It was all worth it, I can see your face one more time\" \nThis happened 2 days ago. Now I am sitting in my room while I am seriously thinking about suicide. I dont know where to go from here...", "subreddit": "lonely"}

I realized I haven't made many friends since I graduated high school and the friends I did have I lost touch with because such is life. Since then I haven't really made any friends entering young adulthood, and when I did I managed to fuck up those relationships someway, somehow (e.g. get drunk and say some things I shouldn't).\n\nOutside of my parents and this one friend I have who actually is more of a girlfriend I don't have anyone else. I feel pathetic for always only hanging out with her and when she's busy with her other friends and needs time away from me (which I fully support) I feel even more pathetic when that means I'll just be at home alone, probably crying. When I think about that I get sooo sad. And it's not like I don't try to branch out and be more social. If a group of people invite me out I have almost always agreed to go out with them (and have). \n\nBut lately, I'm not sure if it's my own securities getting in the way again but if I get invited out I decline because the inner voice inside my mind has more and more to say: \"They're inviting you because you're a loser and they're just being nice. This is their form of performing a charitable act. Nobody wants to actually be around you, or speak to you. You're too socially awkward and boring. Don't become another burden for someone else.\"  \n\nI mean when I do manage to go out with my acquaintances I can't stop my anxiety from controlling my every thought and it's such a mess. I can't fully engage in a conversation or contribute meaningfully. It's embarrassing. \n\nI'm not looking for advice or suggestions or anything. I know what I need to do in order to be more social and make friends, but it's a matter of getting past the intrusive thoughts. I guess I just wanted to put my feelings out there and hope maybe someone else experiences a similar thing?", "subreddit": "lonely"}

{"post_id": "bwg4fl", "created_utc": 1559596471, "title": "Feeling down because of my social life", "author": "PG1143", "self_text": "Hi! In a few months I'll enter college and I'm feeling quite excited and anxious for that.   \n\n\nLooking back at my High School years I was never a very social and open person, I believe I've always been seen by my classmates as more shy, reserved, introverted in general. I don't think they're wrong if they actually see me like that, however beliefs tend to shape behaviors and so I've always had the feeling that because they perceive me like that I ended up being left out. It's not like I was alone all the 3 years I spent in that class, as a matter of fact I'm pretty sure the times I was actually on my own during school time were far more rare than those when I'm in my classmates company. Despite this fact whenever I'm around them I still get this sense that I'm alone, as they're the ones who do all the talking and I just stand there listening to whatever they're talking about, sometimes I'm not even sure whether everyone who's in there even knows I'm there. As a result of this something that accompanied me throughout that time (and still does) is loneliness, and sometimes, when I'm at my worst, depressive thoughts. This is rather funny because it affects me quite a lot but I still do nothing in relation to it, I just let it be. I'm aware I can do something to try and revert it, for instance I can come out of my comfort zone when talking to my peers and try and interact with them more, but I do none of that, I don't have the will for such a thing. I'm not quite sure why that is, perhaps it's the fact that I find most of my classmates very uninteresting given that I have nothing in common with them, perhaps it's because they mostly do small talk or talk about other people's lives and cars, and I'm not a big fan of such conversations, or perhaps it may also be because I went into the 10th grade with the mentality that I'd only be around for 3 years with those people and afterwards I'd go to college and most likely never see any of them again, which kind of put me off the idea of establishing and developing relations with others because I'd stop seeing them anyways, so I thought \"What's the point?\". Nonetheless there's at least 1 person for whom I care very much in that class which I could consider to be a friend, as I'm more comfortable around them, but even in that case I don't see it as anything permanent, besides the time I spent with the person in school we never hang out nor text, so I believe there's a big possibility we will never interact with each other again once I leave for college. Also the way that friendship (if I can call it that) started is very unsettling, as for me it seems like the person only got close to me because of my grades, which kind of hurts.  \n\n\nBut basically as a result of my experience in High School I'm now putting a lot of hopes that College is going to change my social life (in a positive way). Obviously I don't know whether that's true or not, however given that so many different people frequent College and that I'm going to a course that I have a fair amount of interest for, I just have this idea that it will be easy to find like-minded people with whom I'll actually create long-lasting relationships, or at least that's what I hope for... But here a problem arises, what if my expectations won't correspond to reality and everything will just be the same or even worse than it currently is? That scares me a bit, as I'm not sure I'll actually be able to handle such a thing.\n\nOkay but enough about this, I've said too much for now. What do you guys think of my situation? And is putting a lot of hopes that in the future things will just get better a good thing?", "subreddit": "lonely"}

I've been angry and bitter for so long, I just can't keep up this charade anymore. Every time I see couples, on facebook, in public, anywhere, its not the face of anger you see. It might not change, but I'm sad. I'm lonely. I can't take being angry and envious at people just because they found someone that they want to spend the rest of their lives with. It's not right. But its also not right to tell me I should be happy and content because I'm single and alone. That doesn't equate happiness. Happiness is all dependent on the individual. I don't feel right being alone. Having hardly any friends to hang out with, especially finding single friends.

My forever alone story started with a girl I befriended at 7 years old, who was a year younger and turned out to be a blackmailer (her mom taught her well). From there, it snowballed. Especially once I hit puberty and became awkward looking. Girls would reject me left and right, usually in cruel ways.\n\nThis progressed to people barking at me on the street, or filming me while making fun of my looks. \n\nAlmost every girl/woman I've interacted with has either thought I was ugly, or creepy (usually because I was ugly). It got so bad that a couple times I've been accused of sexual harassment for innocent things, such as telling a customer of mine that I liked her jacket. \n\nThings are supposed to get better, so they say, whoever \"they\" are, but they seem to be either staying the same or getting slightly worse. I've tried all the normie advice, which is shit I've already been doing anyway. Even that stuff doesn't work. If I'm in a room with a fat smelly guy, I think pretty much every woman would choose the fat smelly guy. \n\nAs for what I look like, I'm a short, skinny light skinned black man who looks like if you threw Urkel from Family Matters and Larry Butz from the Ace Attorney games in a blender. It sounds weird but it's true and even others see it. I have a really large forehead and while I have all my teeth, I have a massive underbite that makes my smile look creepy.\n\nBasically, I look like an alien. It doesn't help that it seems like black men who act out the stereotypes of our race are vastly preferred over guys like me. Even if I COULD find people who were into anime and video games, hardly any like the same ones as I do.\n\nDating sites are a no go. I spent five years off and on on a lot of them. Even though my profile was a cut above the rest of guys (I know this from signing up as a woman to check guys profiles) I've only gotten two mistaken right swipes. Any attempt to message a woman anything would lead to getting blocked. \n\nI'd say, all told, between real life and online, I've gotten rejected with no successes about 1,700-1,800 times. I lost count back in 2014 at around 1,300.\n\nI met a woman four years ago who seemed to be really sweet and was the female version of me, but she ghosted me nine months after meeting. We never dated or anything. Fast forward to now and I really like a woman who has been a long time customer at my store. I finally formally met her last year after six years. I'm not sure if it will go anywhere, though. I'm worried she will hate me after a while like everyone else so far.\n\nBut yeah, that's my abridged story.", "subreddit": "ForeverAlone"}

He was very eloquent when he talked tho and he was athletic (not bulky, more like ripped, but not too much). Later on we became buds, he was a nice person and he would spend most of the time in there talking to me and other guys. He would barely pay attention to any the girls, if any. Eveything pretty normal until I found out about some stuff...\n\nI found out that some of the girls in there were saying \"omg, he is so pretty, so handsome, etc\" and he just ignored them all and they were crazy over him, for literally no reason.\n\nHe even told me that him and one of the girls stumbled upon the same bus once and he relates that all of a sudden she went like crazy on him, inviting him to some rock concert or that if they could get lunch together or something. He said that he told her that he couldn't, that he had too much stuff to do, he even told me that he was like \"wtf is wrong with this bitch, she is completely nuts!\". They barely talked to each other. By the way, this girl had a bf, we had seen him numerous times, either picking her up or making out with her. Also she stated this several times, one way or another. Seems she didn't care about that for this guy and also, he didn't know she had a bf until I told him. He was very surprised.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nPerphaps he had a powerful charm or something? Either way, we had a conversation about women and he told me \"I don't try anymore, all women are bitches and want to get advantage of you or cheat on you, that's why you won't see me chasing anyone\". Wow. I learned that women do love men that ignore them all of the time and that if you are good looking enough, you don't have to do anything. This is such a sad revelation that almost makes you want to give up in life.\n\nThat really surprised me and made me really sad, because it's true. This guy gets attention from women and does not care for any of them anymore, yet we all FA'rs try our asses off to try to get a girl we may like, just to get ignored, mocked or both.

The only way to get better at socializing is to socialize. Stepping out of your comfort zone, no matter how hard it may be, is your best bet at meeting new people. Good situations like this are self improvement places and specialty stores such as gyms, rec centers, hobby/craft shops. As strange as it may sound, role playing groups (the groups that LARP) are very friendly to newcomers as well. I've met people who say they've made a personality flip from an \"antisocial\" individual to a rather outgoing person. If you live in the US, chances are there's a group like that near you.\n\nThis might sound a bit like a broad stroke, but the best place to start in a lot of situations is to start small. Start with small talk. If you get anxiety from small talk, the best thing you can do is ask relevant questions \"What do you do?\" \"How long have you been doing that?\" \"What would you say is your most/least favorite part of that?\" Something you shouldn't do is be the only one asking questions, this is a conversation not an interview.\n\nIf I have any advice in the future, I'll be sure to share.

We then started to get to know each other with our interests and views. I got to know her through watching some of her favorite films which I've never heard of. I was enjoying how we were progressing with our relationship. I remember our first time hanging out together alone. We went to watch a film she always wanted to watch which only was released in the US. I think after that night I grew a view of trusting and felt very comfortable with her. As time went by, our conversations started to get more on a personal level and me noticing how she was opening up, I also started to open up my personal mind. My issues. My struggles and such. She didn't mind it, and was willing to share her perspective on it. Months went by, our relationship kept growing and the awkward silences were no more. We literally were talking and spending time after a night out with other friends for 3-4 hours 'after everyone had left, meaning it was only us alone again'. It was a good night.\n\nIt took me a few months of knowing and getting comfortable with her to ask her on a date. We went to a annual art installation festival in our city and spent our time together again. Note, I have never had the guts to tell or ask someone out. I felt proud and refreshed to be able to finally ask someone after my entire life. \n\nThe following week, after that date. She tells me she started using tinder. First thing going through my mind was what the f\\*\\*\\* is going on... She was literally flashing all the messages from the guys she got matched with and deep down, like really deep down. I wanted to cry. But we were having lunch together. So I didn't want to be all emotional in public. I played it off and just gave a disgusting grin to hide my pain. \n\nThe next day I didn't speak to her.\n\nThe following day after, she tells me she has a few dates throughout the week with the tinder matches. Fuck me. I feel like everything I put into our relationship wasn't meaningful anymore.\n\nI honestly thought I found someone that made me happy. I thought life was going to be better from my past relationships. I thought I was going to break away from the FA badge. It is a heart breaker. I am basically back to where I was 8 years ago.

I am very very very shy. Anxious and  never talk to people. I had a group not really friends that I always sat with at lunch. They barley talked to me unless they needed something. Never texted me even tho they had a group chat called squad. They never invited me to their group hangouts. I got a job and started making money. We always at the end of the school day went to the nearby store before catching the bus. They always asked me to buy them shit and I did because I am very nice. Plus I liked the attention for once. They left me when I bought them stuff. Eventually I met a girl  that I liked and ditched my shitty friends. To join her group of friends. She made me really happy even though she never liked me at all. Shortly we all became somewhat friends but something was off just like the other group. They never texted me. They never talked to me. Never asked to hang out. She ditched me first chance she got to be with her friends. Let\u2019s go to my job now. Guess what THEY NEVER TALKED TO ME EITHER!!! I\u2019m like what the fuck is wrong with me. Are they afraid of skinny white 19 year old who looks like he\u2019s 10. I don\u2019t get it. My family never speaks to me as well.

His looks don't hurt him obviously but he does work hard and deserve it. This is just a vent so please don't read too much into it or try to nitpick it or be offended. I'm not saying all women are like this. It was just such a classic example of how different someone who is attractive is treated compared to someone who is unattractive.\n\nGirl walks into the store. She's in that 18-20 age range. I'm at the front but need to use the bathroom. I say hi and she gives me that look. The unattractive FA'ers know about that look. I don't care since I'm so used to it. My chad coworker comes up so I can go to the bathroom. I'm walking to the back when she walks out in front of me and towards the back. She keeps looking back at me like I'm following her. She had this look of almost terror like a creep is following her. In reality, I was just going to the back because I had to use the bathroom. She pulls to the side and I walk past to the bathroom. A couple minutes later I'm walking up from the bathroom and see her and chad coworker talking. It's like she turned into a different person. She's smiling, laughing, and talking to him. I get back up and she walks out. I wanted to say something but it wouldn't have made sense to him. \n\n[Siderant]My chad coworker actually knows I'm FA. He is always warning me that I should avoid most women. He's a social conservative and is vocal about it to me. I don't mind because he has every right to have his beliefs. I don't agree with some of them but when you are chad, people are usually far less easily offended. Since he is a social conservative, he's monogamous. He has an insanely attractive girlfriend. Life is good for him. He went to Europe for a few months with his girlfriend. I went home to keep being FA and he went to his insanely attractive girlfriend's house to do things like have sex.[/Siderant]\n\nI'm not saying all women are like the one tonight but just the difference in how we were treated shows how important looks can be and I doubt she would have been creeped out if my chad coworker was the one walking behind her. This is the life of the unattractive, FA, virgin, employee. I know my place. He has had to deal with women hitting on him by giving him their phone numbers or asking him out on dates.

I had to find a new home for my cats since i didnt have place for them but luckily i could keep my dog. \n\nIn the beginning everything was really hard to be alone but it seemed it was getting better. Now i have been struggling with loneliness for a while and its getting heavier and heavier for me to the point that i feel myself falling back in depression. \n\nThe only thing i have in my life right now is my dog and i love her. I do have a best friend but she is been in Curacao for 5 months, she will come back next week finally, but she doesnt live near me, she has a lot of other friends and her own issues so i usually see her once every 3 weeks. I dont have a drivers license so i cant visit her. And i dont have any other friends. I dont have contact with my family anymore because i dont want to, i still have contact with my parents but we have a very different lifestyle.\n\nIve always been very different/alternative compared to other people and i have my own image and values of life. This results in that i rarrely meet people that i can relate to. And most people i can relate to already have their group of friends. Its hard for me to meet new people since i dont go to school anymore, i work.

I know he also sees me as a potentional partner. But we ve only seen each other in real for 2 weeks.\nTickets to America are very expensive and i dont have much money. \n\nI wish i could date him like normal people can because i actually think he could be my life partner. Especially because i feel so lonely i almost want to hop on a plane, go live there with him and never go back. But i am afraid my mind is not in the right place right now to make that very rushed decision. \nI am going to try to go to America this summer for a month (if i have enough money) to get to know him more. But i dont know if thats possible cause of the money. And also... what if i really fall in love with him? and i have to go back to the Netherlands after that month... i am afraid i am only going to feel more lonely.\nHowever if he s really the one i would be ready to leave all of this behind and move there, since i have nothing here and i hate my life here.

I just dont know what to do anymore in my life. I just dont want to feel this miserable and alone, if this keeps going on like this... i dont know if i can. I am already getting suicidal thoughts in my head because i have the feeling things are never going to change and my life will always stay this lonely and fcked up. (Ive been true a lot in my life) when i tell other people about this their reaction is: \"This is life\". Well... if this is life, its not worth living it and i dont want it.

One could say I'm a late bloomer, or it's merely that a special someone hasn't crossed into my life as of now. It hasn't been an entirely big deal that it'd be worth making a fuss about except that I felt my loneliness (not to be confused with being alone) kept rearing its ugly head, since the start of this year. It was enough to go start re-seeing my university counselor/therapist recently, who she told me that my loneliness was very telling about me, after seeing her for a couple of sessions last year. Still my loneliness became a fuel to motivate myself through the semester to get all my assignments and exams out of the way, and hopefully, give me time to reflect on my feelings after.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIn the spare time that I was able to mull over and deconstruct my feelings through browsing online forums that described similar feelings, I've stumbled across platonic cuddling. Safe to say, it piqued my interest, and the concept of it quite intriguing, to be physically (or emotionally if it came to that) affectionate with someone who you are comfortable trusting. Had one male friend in mind to ask that I on some level trust, to be open-minded at the very least though he probably politely rejected at the offer (understandable), though it gave me some understanding as to how this can be a hard thing to do, nonetheless, understand for most people.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nExploring further into platonic cuddling as I've researched more and more, I've eventually found myself in a position where I deeply crave for the desire of looking for cuddle buddies. I've never really been physically/emotionally affectionate with any one when I was a wee child, at least, not that I can remember, so I guess it was interesting... unlocking a part of myself I didn't knew existed. Even more, was finding out what I was comfortable and boundaries were, to the point of a romantic friendship (!!!) in which I found to be most desirable for me: cuddling/snuggling, spooning, holding hands, kisses on forehead/cheeks/neck... minus the sex and thought of a relationship. Essentially, it was a friendship where it had the romantic elements it... well, almost. Interesting to say the least, that I tried searching for guys who may share the same sentiment online, had meet-ups with the ones interested, but never going further to what I wanted. Either I thought we wouldn't work out (sexual guy and a non-sexual guy) to guys who were merely curious to the idea as they've never heard of it, but were understandably uncomfortable in doing it after some reflection.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFiguring out my peculiar desires, sex never really crossed my mind, even hoping at the thought for one. It was as if it sex was completely foreign to me. Now, for the record, I'm a 20M gay guy and never really have I felt sexually attracted to anyone, at least, remember the last time I felt it. It was this I realized I was a homoromantic grey asexual. It was this, that all the dots started lining up. Of course, all the parts and plumbing were all working fine, but it's as if I didn't care for it. As much as it answered some questions that I've been wondering myself, it led to even more questions and this is where the nitty gritty stuff comes into play...\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**How on earth do I meet guys who feel the same way?** It didn't help I had my preferences (average joe-to masculine guys) but I wanted to cuddle with a guy whom I could feel safe, protected and confident but importantly, a guy who's very open, secure, and could completely understand the sentiment that sex and intimacy can be mutually exclusive. I didn't care of the orientation, but what I cared about, was the physical and emotional intimacy. And if it somehow progressed into much more, I wouldn't have any qualms about it (though my sexual orientation has made me feel finding love to be like expecting a win for the Chicago cubs, so whilst I'm open, I'm not actively looking to date)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI had felt frustrated one time, feeling I was inadequate to feel like most other people would do (be sexually and romantically attracted to someone) that I was somehow \"allowing\" myself to feel this way, that I was merely shooting myself in the foot. But I just can't bring myself to be sexually attracted like a guy... WITH a guy. How can most guys be able to juggle with that dilemma? Having to be satisfied with a highly likely sexless romantic relationship (if it came to that). It was something that made me feel queasy, that it sounded so emasculating, and I wouldn't place blame on guys who'd drop like flies if they were interested in me, upon learning I was a grey asexual. Deep inside me, I'm starting to question if this is my fault for feeling this way.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nApologies for the relatively long post, but I just felt it wouldn't be healthy to keep this bottled up inside me. It feels like talking to a brick wall if I explain this to most of my friends and people I know.", "subreddit": "ForeverAlone"}

Last day of school, bell rang, and I just started walking. Didn\u2019t really know where, I just wanted to walk. See how far I could get before I had someone come pick me up. It was interesting to see what was down that road. Never had any reason to go there before. It was mostly farmland and a couple neighborhoods. I found a pretty butterfly, found a mini waterfall, and stood on a road that was right next to the end of a runway and saw a plane take off. I want to do it again, but there\u2019s a lot of reasons I can\u2019t. I don\u2019t exactly live in the nicest of areas, I\u2019d need someone to pick me up afterwards, and... Idk. It was refreshing though. Gave me a lot of time to think. \n//\nI guess the most important thing to me right now is preparing for my future and finding a girl that will always be there for me. Which is very hard to do if you\u2019re someone like me lol. I think a lot of you can relate. Yes I lust for some of the girls I meet, but it\u2019s always buried by the desire for love. \n//\nI\u2019m working on really changing myself right now.  I can\u2019t say it\u2019s going great. I always feel defeated, that nothing will ever change. \n//\nSome who know me may know that i love making a good puzzle. Those people do not know me. As hard as I try, I only lose myself in my words, and leave the others even more lost than me. I tell them of codes and riddles they must solve, but like a poorly researched Rubik\u2019s cube t-shirt, it\u2019s unsolvable\u2014or rather, it is solvable, but it can\u2019t be dissected for any meaning. It\u2019s only purpose was to be there, to be solved. I can give them rewards or hints, but nothing will show them why I really make these puzzles. \n//\nI dream. I dream of being creative. I dream of being able to thoroughly express myself. I dream of dreaming dreams that I will never wake up from. But alas, I am snapped awake every time by the cold touch of reality. I awaken to familiar scenes, so familiar I can close my eyes and they\u2019ll still be there. They overtake everything. An invasive vision that fills my head from neuron to neuron, making a network so secure that to break it would be to shatter all that I know. Is it worth starting anew? The fear of the unknown guides me, the unknowing, to a destination unbeknownst to me. I only follow it because i know not what else to do. There\u2019s nothing else anywhere and i can\u2019t be alone. No. I don\u2019t want to be alone. In the company of another I can make a cure. Another door to walk through. Another path to light the way. But the path flickers behind me. Beyond the refraction of its waves, it crumbles. As much as I hope that it does not catch up to me, it will. It always does. It always has. And again I fall. I\u2019m left with what will never leave me. It will always be by my side, showing me a way. Maybe not the way I hoped, but a way nonetheless. Control was stripped from me the moment I took a step in another direction. There\u2019s no escaping this path. I realize this now, that the other paths were simply detours. I arrive at the same place every time. But\u2014it\u2019s not out to get me. It lets me stray because it knows I will shortly return. I look closer and analyze it more each time, wondering why. And each time, I come to the same conclusion. A randomness so pure that not even it itself can predict where it might go next. \n//\nI\u2019m too tired. I\u2019m sorry you had to read that.

It's like I'm a ghost. People can walk away mid conversation because someone else has turned up or whatever you have to say just gets shrugged off with either mumbling in agreement or nodding just to seem like they're listening. Sometimes it feels like people can't get away quick enough. I'd be surprised to even be acknowledged in the mornings at work. \n\nIs this a part of growing up? I'm 32m btw. \n\nI've always made the effort with people, I\u00a0used to have a loads of friends. I've traveled and I've met loads of great people none of which stay in touch. It's like I'm out of sight out of mind. I've felt like this most of my life and it's only just recently started to feel more worse than usual. I've only ever had one best friend and that lasted close to 20 years and we always felt like we were the only ones that understood each other until that fizzled out about a year ago over no reason. \n\nI've always got on well with my family, they're amazing people but I never got on with my extended family. Everybody else did, but me. We just couldn't click. It was like I could see them for who they really were. They always gave off the impression they were better than you, very bigheaded, 'your opinion doesn't matter' type. I was always told it's cause they're a \"different generation\" being as they're 10 or 15 years older than me so I just assumed the age gap was the issue. That was until aunts or cousins started having kids of their own and everybody took notice of them but I was still ignored or cast aside like a leper. It would just of been nice to of been asked how I was or how school was going. General chitchat or be invited out like everyone else. I used to wonder what was wrong with me and to be honest I still do to this day. You learn to ignore it but somewhere it cuts pretty deep. \n\nFor years growing up when Christmas rolled around we would all go to my aunt's house for dinner and to exchange gifts. One of my cousin's was quite wealthy and would show off by showering everyone with gifts, no matter what age or if he hadn't seen them for years.\u00a0Buying holidays abroad, cruises, high-end clothes, games consoles, experience days. (Anything that was expensive basically) spoiling everyone. Apart from me. I would get a Christmas card. Some years I didn't even get that. I wasn't jealous, I'm not the type. Again, it would be nice to be part of it all.\u00a0 \n\nI hated growing up thinking I didn't matter or that the 'different generation' quote was just some bullshit excuse. Like I said, you learn to ignore it. \n\nIt genuinely feels like I don't exist. It's such a weird feeling. I'm a fun guy, really good sense of humour (or used to have, God knows now) I love to have a laugh and don't seem to have a problem starting conversations with anyone. I feel like the issue is I can't hold a conversation with most people anymore.\u00a0At work for example, if I can't talk about welding or going fishing nobody makes the effort to talk about anything else. I feel like I have fuck all in common with anyone these days. \n\nI've had a few jobs over the years and just can't seem to connect with anyone anymore. I'm starting to convince myself there's something wrong with me and it's frustrating to try pinpoint what it is! It's like I'm cursed or the universe hates me.\n\nMaybe I am a ghost? Maybe none of this is even real? Maybe I've took a huge hit off a bong and this is one big trip, wake up onboard a spaceship surrounded by my aliens mates one day and they're laughing at me due to throwing a whitey!\u00a0 Haha. Imagine!? Weirdo. Anyway! \n\nI'm so convinced with this ghost shit that it won't even get noticed here on Reddit. I'm not an attention seeker even though this does feel attention seekerish. But I guess we'll see. \n\nApologies for the rant. This is my first post on Reddit. I always wondered if anyone else experiences this. Is anyone out there! \n\nI'm Invisible.", "subreddit": "lonely"}

There are huge aspects of my personality that I hide from friends, family, everyone. Things that I do almost everyday and affect me everyday that people have no clue about.  If I died I'm not sure there would even be a record of it somewhere. Some of these things I consider to be embarrassing/shameful (although nothing actually bad), but some are rather innocuous like my music taste or my favorite tv shows and movies. If it wasn't for my mom who knows a lot about me (by virtue of being my mom) and talks to people about me, there wouldn't really be anyone who knows me. Even my mom knowing me well sometimes feels uncomfortable.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI guess it's no surprise that I feel like I do not have strong connections to other people. But I also do not want to give up my private life. I like being alone. I like living in my head. I like that people do not know me. But at the same time I find it very lonely. I've tried to balance this in the past, but I've ended up revealing too much and later regretting it. It is also difficult to make friends. I can easily get to a friendly stage with people. Enough that they might call me their friend, but since they know almost nothing about me I hesitate to call them mine. A deeper connection, I've never had. Writing it out, it seems so self-inflicted, but I can't stress enough how uncomfortable it makes me when people know private details about me. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIn some ways this has gotten a bit better. I'm growing very close to my best friend. But this may be because I've moved countries this past year, so I have a lot more time away from him. Absence makes the heart grow fond? I also visited him last week and told him some things about my family situation and that didn't go badly at all. He seemed a bit surprised though. In other ways they've gotten worse. I'm struggling to make friends here, the kind to hang out with when bored. All my friends back home were people I knew for like 2 years before I even became friends with them, so I don't know how I'm gonna get past that here. I hesitate to mention this, cause I feel like it colors people's view of me, but I'm a trans man. I'm going stealth here (no one knows that I'm trans) and while I do love it, it just adds another layer of distance between me and other people. All my old friends know I'm trans, cause they knew me before I even realized I was trans. It's also something I'm very insecure about, so I don't know if I'll ever really tell anyone.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis is all friendship stuff. I don't even know how I'm gonna go about dating. I really don't think it will work for me. Spending too much time with one person irritates me and I end up resenting them. I'd have to date someone who understood my need for a lot of alone time or that they also had the same need. I just don't think there are many people like that. I feel like if I was born a man I would just have a lot of one night stands, but I can't even do that. I also really want to be a father, but the thought of co-parenting and having to compromise on the way I raise my child does not appeal to me. I doubt I'll ever have a child because of this.

No matter what, rejection and the other bad stuff in life hurts, but when you have something good to turn to in that time; close friends or family, it makes it so much easier and you move on in healthier ways. It just seems like the people who have good connections and belong somewhere are those guys you see out in the world who are just ok, like they got it together and im starting to think more and more that it's because of those close connections, not that they come as a result of. Its so hard to spark these connections when you didn't grow up in a good social setting cause you then don't know how. So those of us who are \"born\" loneley are basically destined to stay so cause all we know is \"how to be loneley\" unless someone were to just selflessly invest their time on inviting us in to their circle and accepting/ teaching us. It seems impossible to be fulfilled in solitude or rather, to somehow escape solitude without help, it requires active assistance and idk how to get any. Tl;dr self improvement is always good but i think that old saying \"you have to be happy on your own before you're happy with someone else\" is bs because it downplays how connections do make people happy and without them we're stuck.

I didn't call it FA then but I started to think maybe I wasn't a late bloomer like people had told me. I still remember prom night.\n\nThe day of the prom everyone in class was talking about prom. They talked about who they were going with. Groups of friends were renting limos. I thought about going alone but I saw it would cost lots of money to buy or rent a tuxedo, pay to get into prom, and would have to sit there alone. I remember telling someone who could have been my therapist since I was in and out of therapy in high school due to obvious reasons that I wasn't going to prom. They told me I should go because I will never get another chance. If I go, maybe a girl would see me and want to dance with me. They also said you could be with your friends and have fun without a girl. The problem was I didn't have any friends my senior year. I talked to a couple kids in class but that was the closest I came to having friends. I had more bullies than friends. \n\nThe night of prom came and part of me wanted to go. It was too late but I thought maybe I would regret not going. I thought it over and realized it was best to not go. I stayed home and wondered how common it was for kids to not go to prom. I went to a search engine and typed in, didn't go to prom. The results were mostly from message boards. Most people said it wasn't a big deal and how they met people in college and had their first relationships in college. I was still depressed and felt like something was wrong with me. In the late 90's and early 2000's romantic comedy movies were popular and prom was a major event that something would happen at. I knew most movies were not realistic about prom but I still thought something was wrong with me. \n\nThat night I sat at my computer and for the first time was lonely. I started questioning if I could ever meet a woman who was interested in me. It was the first time I thought about FA.\n\nNow I'm almost 36 and will never escape FA. It wasn't over for me since I didn't go to prom because some people were late bloomers who met people in college. I made a couple woman friends in college but each one had a boyfriend. It was over for me on prom night but I didn't know. I clung to the belief that I was a late bloomer. My first close woman friend was my oneitis and that didn't go well. \n\nI hope none of you high school aged posters have to go through your adult years FA. I still think most of you are late bloomers but maybe I'm wrong. Do what you can to escape FA because being FA my age has caused me to become bitter and hate myself for being FA.\n\nTl;dr prom night was the first time I worried about FA.", "subreddit": "ForeverAlone"}

This one girl in particular seemed awkward around other people and didn\u2019t talk much, but I tried talking and joking around with her and she opened up to the point where another coworker said \u201cI\u2019ve never seen you talk this much\u201d to her and we talk basically every shift now. So, I took that as a sign that she might like me. I\u2019m 21 and haven\u2019t had a crush since high school, but I couldn\u2019t get this girl off my mind for a week or so. At that point I was thinking maybe I can ask her out for a drink or something and I started to plan it in my head. Then I looked her up on Facebook for the specific reason of seeing if she had a guy in her profile picture and she did, so crush over.  \n\nFast forward a week and a guy at work who\u2019s even newer than me asked her for her number and if she wanted to go out. She gave him an ambiguous answer and then later that night after he left she told another coworker about it while I was within earshot and a supervisor walked into the conversation and all 3 of them were laughing about this dude for 15min. \n\nI feel like I dodged a bullet by randomly deciding to check Facebook and I feel bad for the guy who got made fun of behind his back, but props to him for having the guts to ask.\n\nStrangely, I also feel proud of myself for comfortably thinking about asking a girl out for the first time ever (I legitimately think I would\u2019ve if I hadn\u2019t checked fb).

She\u2019s a little dorky and awkward, but in a good way. We\u2019re both introverted, quiet, nerdy, and have a very similar sense of humor. I also happen to think she\u2019s kinda cute too. Ever since high school, I\u2019ve always wondered \u201cwhat if?\u201d.\n\nWhen we saw each other, we immediately started joking around like no time had passed at all.

Would it be weird or inappropriate? I\u2019m pretty sure she\u2019s always only seen me platonically.\u201d Etc\n\nAt the end of my shift when I was supposed to leave, I hung around for a few more minutes to talk to her more. This was the moment. The opportunity to ask for her number. I brought up staying connected on social media which she said she doesn\u2019t use too often. This was my time to ask for her number instead. But I....just couldn\u2019t. I got so riddled with anxiety that froze when I attempted to ask for her number. I\u2019m sure I looked really awkward, and I\u2019m sure she must of sensed that I wanted to ask something and held it back. \n\nI just feel like shit. I could\u2019ve done it.

They tell me that I\u2019m losing track of what\u2019s important. I might as well be listening to static. I\u2019m trapped here not because I wish to torture myself, but due to the necessity of finding another way out. A viable solution that differs from the suggested: Pretend it\u2019s not there. It summons infinite branches of other queries that dig their roots into the parts of my mind I thought were safe: Why an I here at all? Is ignorance truly bliss? Is suicide an option? Why am I writing this? Etc. We are all alone in our thoughts, and more than most of us are alone outside of our thoughts just the same. But even then we are split. Many tend to focus too much on where the entity has led them; either looking back at their footsteps with rose colored lenses or an illusionary fading of a pathway tinted blue. The others are too distracted by the nothing that has surrounded them as they walked the path; still there, but with a thousand yard stare that closes off their peripherals.

I thought that it was the right thing to do because I felt as if neither of us were getting anything out of it and we had talked about that constantly but it turned out I was wrong. She was my best friend and she was always there for me no matter what happened and I threw it all away. \n\nI\u2019m home from my freshman year of college and missing those friends is so hard. It\u2019s so weird to go from seeing these people literally every day to not seeing them at all and the ways we can talk is just never the same and I\u2019m always scared that I\u2019m going to grow apart from them. \n\nI also feel like my friend group from home feels different about me. I really like the idea of partying but I get anxious and awkward and never know what to say. Whenever I am in a group with them I feel like when I say something it just gets shut down or nobody responds idk I\u2019m probably just imagining it. And this is even worse because my ex was good friends and whenever we would hangout as a group she would always respond to the things that I would say. \n\nHonestly I would say the hardest things are 1. Seeing everybody have fun in other places without me and 2. Knowing that I shouldn\u2019t be feeling this way. I have a fantastic family and they are all very supportive of me in no matter what I do.

A lot of people are scared of dying alone, unnoticed and unloved but I'm just like \"Eh, okay.\" about the whole idea. I don't really have a desire for a romantic relationship or friendship but I have been feeling kinda bothered lately. Do people really care about being cared for these days? I want to believe that they do but it just doesn't seem like it. I noticed it's very unlikely/ not doable to have a \"regular friendship\" and most people want casual friendships anyway so I decided it would be best to go with that. Casual friendship like someone or a couple of people to play games with but afterwards they kinda just ignore your existence til it's time to play again. I can handle that type of relationship. It really seems like quantity over quality matters most to people and I suppose I can understand that. Why have one or a couple people that genuinely care about you when you can flaunt and be admired by a bunch of strangers?\n\nI guess I am a tad disappointed because I reached out to someone I met on this sub years back and after a month I had to stop because of issues and the guy pretty much said he prefers strangers and didn't really want to talk to me anymore. He claimed to not have any friends and I wanted to be his friend to make him happy. It's such a shame really. I really cared about the guy and we seemed to have stuff in common. He was a part of one of those \"charity subs\" and appeared to be well liked. I thought it was better to have someone that actually cares about you rather than a bunch of people that only like you because you gave them advice or brought them make up but again quantity over quality. It's something I'm gonna have to make myself fully understand.\n\nI'm serious when I say I have no desire to be loved or cared for. The thought scares me frankly but I probably don't have to worry about that. If someone were to care about me for some reason I would show some sort of appreciation so I won't waste their time. I just want someone to care about and talk to occasionally and have that someone show me appreciation because I care about them. I'm not asking for much but I would like something more than just being told I'm appreciated because words mean nothing. I think being asked seldomly how are you without me always asking that question first is good enough. Is it wrong to want something because you care about someone?\n\nI honestly wouldn't mind giving someone everything they want if I'm able to afford it without any type of gain but I would like some appreciation at least just to keep things fair.\n\nI'm just really in an awkward position. If no one I come across cares about being cared for I don't know what to think or do besides just focus on being successful and making more money.\n\nI suppose people like me could fit right in with the \"sugar lifestyle\" but I don't have the money for it or want to be appreciated \"that way\" if you get what I mean.\n\nThis is super long so I don't expect any responses but thanks if you decided to click c:", "subreddit": "lonely"}

You've loved watching it, playing the video games, and shooting hoops in your drive way.  Only problem is *ziiiip* you've never actually played on a real team before.\n\nNow as you get older, you realize that while you love the game, you've never played at school or on community teams anymore, so it's becoming a fading dream for you.\n\nExcept one day, you win a contest and get invited to play basketball with the Denver Nuggets (or whatever your favourite team is, f u).  It's a once in a lifetime opportunity.  But the big problem is that you suck.  And if you accept the invitation, everyone on your favourite team will see how badly you suck.  It will be a humiliating embarrassment that will follow you until the end of your days.  And heaven forbid if there is an audience involved, at which point you will not only be shamed in front of your idols, but in front of the general public too.\n\nThis is pretty much why, at nearly 40, I think I am pretty much committed to the idea of staying FA.  I'm pretty sure everyone takes a good look at me knows I am a virgin.  But in all honesty, at this age, I think staying one is less embarrassing than getting the chance to change that, and having the chick find out when I am at my most vulnerable that I have no idea what I am doing and that I am a sorry excuse for a man.  I guess the good news for me is that based on my experience, I'll never get the chance to find out.\n\nI guess the moral of the story for my bros out there is to do everything you can to escape when you are young.

While the technology is a very impressive testimony of the human mind, the way they are used is just enraging. Most people will prioritize what is going on on their phone over present people.\nI have a small circle of friends and I see this happen constantly. I especially love when people suddenly start showing crappy videos to each other, bringing the atmosphere of togetherness to a complete halt. You can tell by their body language that everybody just waits for the video that is currently shown to stop, so they can finally show theirs. I also get asked why I don't use social media to which I respond that I rather not have my personality analyzed by some shady algorythms in order to sell me crap. People usually look at me as if I was insane when I say this. I sometimes like to peek on peoples phone checking their newsfeed and the amount of utter garbage on there leaves me speechless. I feel especially sorry for the kids who grow up with this crap. Keep in mind that social media is designed to be addictive as possible. It gives people instant gratification and a person that is used to instant gratification from a young age will have it very hard in real adult life.\n\nThe true genius act is the marketing of these apps though. They sell it to the people as way to connect to each other (which is a noble idea), but the reality is that it drives people apart and encourages shallowness. It preys on the ancient fear of humans of being left out and this is very effective combined with addictive mechanics.\nI'd love to post some related science here, but it's more fun to go down that rabbit hole by oneself in case you're interested.", "subreddit": "ForeverAlone"}

I can't really blame him but he never made much of an effort to stay in touch with me either so I'm not going to beat myself up about it. I'm considering deleting my Facebook and making a new account and only adding those I'm genuinely close to which would be less than ten people compared to the 260 or so I had on my account now (it's gone down a lot since then).

{"post_id": "byfjm1", "created_utc": 1560046875, "title": "About virginity + Why I feel so detached from society", "author": "VeryPensiveKoala", "self_text": "I am by no means a fan of the show, but if you're familiar with The Bachelor, there's a good chance you may have heard about one of the more recent bachelors being a guy named Colton Underwood, a former NFL player and a 26-year-old virgin. Putting aside his good looks for a moment, there are a few grievances I want to address regarding societal norms and the stigma of being a virgin. Now I don't know if he still is a virgin, but when that season aired, that was basically all anyone ever talked about. Despite how much he constantly reaffirmed that it was something he wasn't ashamed of and how it didn't play a big role in his life, the show, the media, and society as a whole wasted no time in immediately labeling him as the \"26-year-old virgin\" and that was basically what defined him as a person in the eyes of many. What bothers me is just how big of a story this was. Now you can dismiss this by saying how this is just the media being the media, and it's just Hollywood looking for a juicy story or something to boost the show's ratings. But here's the thing, do you know how you boost a show's ratings? By doing or portraying something that captures people's attention. Clearly the show put an emphasis on Colton being a 26-year-old virgin because that's something that would generate higher viewership, simply because it is unfathomable to most people that someone can still be a virgin at that age, and thus it piques their interest and makes them want to watch. Which means that, whether you want to admit it or not, there is a clear stigma that comes with being a virgin after a certain age. If it didn't matter to people, then why was it the only thing ever talked about? If you walk up to anyone who knows of Colton Underwood and ask them to describe him, I guarantee you the first thing that almost everyone would say is not that he's a former professional football player, not that he was on The Bachelor, but that he was still a virgin at the age of 26. If being a virgin at that age is not a big deal, then why do so many people immediately use that label to define him as a person?\n\nAs if that doesn't bother me enough, here's what really bothers me. You have people who not-so-subtly shame Colton for being a virgin. Seriously, watch the clip of that woman walking out on him when he revealed that he was a virgin when he was on The Bachelorette, or if you really want to bang your head through a wall, watch the clip of Wendy Williams outright shaming Colton for being a virgin at his age. While I can't really take Wendy Williams that seriously because she's a cancer to society, her words still make me want to vomit. But, you can argue that those people are in the minority. There are a lot of people who came to his defense, people who saw absolutely nothing wrong with Colton being a virgin at that age, and some even admired him for it...\n\nAnd this is where I want to pull my hair out. Don't get me wrong, it's nice to see that many people dismiss the virgin stigma and take no issue with someone being a virgin at a late age. But what I've noticed is that pretty much everyone that defended Colton's choice to keep his virginity saw it as that, a choice. Every single anti-virgin-shaming comment or statement I read commended people for exercising their choice to hold onto their virginity until they found someone special. I did not find a single comment that addressed the fact that there are people who are still virgins due to other factors such as looks or poor social skills, or both. It's like there's this underlying assumption among society that sex is something that is easily obtainable by everyone, and that most people **choose** to go for it at an early age while some people **choose** to abstain. There's this assumption that every single person has a choice. In Colton's case, sure, he's a very good looking guy and he's socially adept and he seems like a good dude, so yeah he probably did have a choice about whether to lose his virginity at an earlier age but he simply decided to wait. But there is never a single mention by anyone that some people are still virgins not by choice, but because they simply struggle with things like being socially awkward. It's like most people in society just can't fathom that there are regular, good people out there who are still virgins not by choice, but simply because they struggle to attract anyone. If you're a virgin guy at a late age, it's either because you're choosing to wait and find someone special, or you're a neckbeard incel who hates women and has irreparable personality issues. There is no middle ground; you can't just be a normal person in your 20s who's still a virgin without there being some kind of special circumstance. \n\nIt's weird. I mean, there is no scientific law or fundamental rule of nature that says that every person will have found someone or lost their virginity after a certain age, and yet somehow society is convinced that every single person is guaranteed to have lost their virginity by a certain age, and if someone hasn't, it's because they CHOSE not to (or they're a toxic incel). This is what makes me feel so detached from society. I've never felt that me being a virgin is an active decision, I'm a virgin simply because I haven't been able to attract anyone, and that isn't my choice. I'm a virgin not because I'm choosing to abstain, not because I'm physically unhygienic or have a toxic personality, but simply because I struggle with attracting women (mainly due to being socially awkward). And yet somehow this reality, which in itself is simple and makes logical sense, is so completely unfathomable in mainstream society. \n\nSigh... I don't know. I just wanted to get that off my chest. I might as well use the vent flair because I'm basically ranting and it feels cathartic. If you managed to read through all of this, kudos.", "subreddit": "ForeverAlone"}

I need so little to survive that I can meet the demands of others with \"Make me\". I'll gladly follow someone more effective than me. I've yet to meet one. I suspect I never will.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThey laugh when I tell them that the money I make **does** buy me happiness. I work multiple jobs. To invite someone else into my life would mean giving this up. I doubt they'd stick around then. Money cannot effectively buy more time in life, hence my stance on compromise. As a result, I could never even kill myself to escape. I don't believe in an afterlife. I think I'll stop being aware of everything when I die. There are worse possibilities. What if I don't?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThey laugh when I tell them that I will never have kids. \"That'll change,\" they say. I don't bother tell them that I've been seeking sterilisation for the last NINE YEARS. If I've yet to find a doctor that thinks I can make that decision for myself, these bastards sure won't. I will never risk a child having to endure anything like my life. Their non-existence is the greatest gift I can give them.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThey laugh when I tell them that I will never marry. Even without the legal risks or divorce statistics, I've seen my still-married mother nagging my father, and see no love in that marriage or appeal to have one like it. Find me a woman that is honorable, especially when they don't have to be. I preemptively destroyed any hopes my parents had about a 'white picket fence' life for myself over a decade ago to spare them the risk of greater disappointment.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThey laugh when I tell them that I I don't drink, smoke or go out. When they ask if I even had sex, they almost look horrified as I shrug and tell them \"about three years ago.\" It was a lie. It was two years ago. With escorts. I thought a consequence-free situation would be different, but in the end I couldn't even calm my nerves enough to finish. This same situation happened twice before I gave up. If I can't let go with a hooker, how can I let go with anyone else?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIn the end I embraced the solitude and devoted myself to securing my future. And as I thought over my past, I realised that I had always been this way.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMany years ago, a blonde girl once sat next to me on an empty train. I kept my earphones in and stared out the window until my stop. Some would have seen an opportunity. I'd willingly conditioned myself to see otherwise. Security threat. Stranger. Not likely to meet again. Ignore and maintain physical evasion.\n\nTwo years ago, a girl at work, whose boyfriend worked 10 meters away, once asked me about my personal life. As my mind raced with potential negative ways this interaction could play out, I told her about my small number of friends, my refusal to use social media, and eventually of trailer I live in, hoping she'd think I was weird and leave me alone. Instead she asks for my number. Could have been for innocuous reasons. Won't risk it. **Massive** security threat. Likely to meet again. Maintain physical and verbal evasion.\n\nSix months ago, an older woman at the cafe I frequent once inadvertently mentioned that they know where I live. I asked how they knew and they claimed that while driving, they saw my car parked in the place where my parents live. Security threat. Enough data about lifestyle may result in attempt to set me up with someone. Likely to meet again. Maintain verbal evasion.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI can't think any other way. They laugh. They always laughed. I suspect some of you have laughed at the last few paragraphs. When I hear people laughing today, even strangers, I shudder in disgust and fear that I'm the subject of their amusement. Laughing is painful but survivable. The real issue is those who attempt to change me against my will. I'm ready for them with nothing but time, money and knowledge. Imagine a libertarian Tyler Durden, wanting to avoid 'The System' rather than wage an insurgency against it.\n\nEverything I am is the result of looking at life objectively, and deciding that this mentality is the best course of action there is. I know exactly what I am doing, what my problem is and where this path leads and I hate it, goddamn I hate it.\n\nBut there is no better option.", "subreddit": "lonely"}

She had a long term boyfriend and she told me they met by being long term friends before they had a physical relationship. I even met the boyfriend who was very nice. I was having problems dealing with my oneitis and both of them helped me get through it. \n\nBoth of them went to the same college and I thought they would get along with each other due to having similar personalities. I introduced them to each other and they hit it off. He was gay so the boyfriend didn't mind. He didn't mind me because he knew I wasn't a threat. He was one of those guys who knew what he had with his girlfriend and trusted her. I think the first time he saw me in person or even just a picture of me he probably laughed and said, he's not a threat. I introduced them and they became best friends. They constantly went out together. They would say what they did together the previous day. They are probably still friends. \n\nBoth of them ghosted on me and moved on with their lives.

I was the only new kid at my high school when I moved and spent four years as a dedicated outlier, I tried to make friends but just didn't really fit in with any group enough to be a significant part of anyone's life. Had a job too but it was a similar deal, most of the other employees had been friends since childhood and were friendly enough, but really didn't want a new addition. It hurt a lot, as I always had to try to embrace the loneliness and assure myself that it was just the circumstances not me, but I made it through because I figured it was just four shitty years of a long life and really didn't matter in the long term. Then I went to university full of hopes...and for a variety of reasons abused alcohol and a lot of drugs for two years. I've been sober from everything for about a month and am honestly devastated. I left university for the summer realizing that I had squandered so many opportunities and not made any lasting friendships at all, so now I'm back home in another small town w/no one from home or from university to talk to and still dealing with the psychological side effects of coming off of an extended period of self medicating. I'm trying to embrace the idea that being by yourself doesn't have to mean being alone again, but fuck that. I've had to tell myself that most of my life and if I'm honest I really don't want to go through it alone anymore, but my entire world feels too shattered to be able to even try to make friends currently.", "subreddit": "lonely"}

It\u2019s like one after the next. I don\u2019t understand why I can\u2019t find a genuine friendship. I would leave these toxic people for improvement in my mental, emotional, and physical health since each \u201cfriend\u201d was damaging. Yet when I see them living their best lives, I feel like shit. My life has become worse without these toxic people I must admit. They have many friends, boyfriends who deeply care for them, they go places with others, they laugh happily and such. I\u2019m just getting worse. Nobody texts, calls. Nobody asks to hang out and if I ask to they don\u2019t respond, or wait to respond when the day is over and there\u2019s no point. I could lay in my bed all day and nobody will text \u201chey, how\u2019s everything\u201d yet I would always check up on others. I\u2019m learning that many people don\u2019t care. At school these people will talk with you but outside of school you\u2019re a total stranger. They would talk shit about people yet smile in their faces, and completely act like I don\u2019t exist in the process. Summer will be horrible. Like last summer, and the one before, I did nothing but work and stay in the house. I had nobody to hang out with, laugh with, cry with, or make memories with. I would try to make plans and friendships but everything was so one sided. It\u2019s like I was putting effort and they weren\u2019t. I would always have to text first saying \u201chey, you busy today?\u201d And they wouldn\u2019t answer, or read my message and not answer. Even the people who I think care about me most wouldn\u2019t check up on me. I would cry at times, wondering if something is wrong with me. I don\u2019t even bother going on Snapchat. Seeing everyone living their best lives, going on trips, laughing with friends and family angers me. I didn\u2019t even have at least a birthday lunch for my birthday (which my mother wanted me to do with friends) because I had nobody to invite. I\u2019m now at that point where it\u2019s fuck everything and everyone. And I curse at myself for being this way, because this mindset blocks blessings. I\u2019m now too nervous to make friends, due to rejection, and the hurt when they leave, or if I have to because of their toxicity. I don\u2019t rely on anyone anymore, nor do I make them feel like I need them. Because In the back of my mind i know if I act vulnerable, the first thing that pops in my head is \u201cdamn, it\u2019s gonna hurt when you leave\u201d and it always. Fucking. Does.

During my time out there I had a few friends where we would often go out to the bars and drink, or see each other at our respective jobs since there were a lot of restaurants packed on this one street\n\nKnowing these folks for over 5 years I grew dependant on them for friendship, willing to go out more often than I should, or join for any parties going on that night. All the while though I never felt like I was \"in\" with the crowd. I was going through a major depressing bout during that time, and I just couldn't make good enough conversation to keep things interesting. Often times conversations would end with them giving a generic conversation ending response that always left me feeling like I didn't do good enough to keep them interested. \n\nFast forward a few years and after not being able to cope with the stress of my job I packed up and traveled out west to volunteer on a few farms. The desire to live real life experiences drew me towards heading out here as I felt outside of a kitchen I had nothing to talk about anymore, like a mental block stopping me from having any other interesting interests.\n\nWhat has saddened me is the fact that since leaving, I have barely gotten a two word response from any of these friends. I've been gone for three months, and have reached out to make conversation only to be left on read, or voicemail. What really brought me to this point was the latest message I sent, telling one of them that I truly missed them, only to be marked as read. That was a day ago, and I just feel like my concerns have all been confirmed.\n\nI was the \"take him or leave him\" friend. The uninteresting tagalong, and that I miss them far more than they would miss me. Maybe I'm making too much out of it, but it hurts that i've essentially brought myself to the brink of begging them for conversation or some type of knowledge of existence.\n\nive made friends out here that have made me feel loads better about my life, and made me feel like I matter again, but I still feel hung up on the fact that I can't get over the thought that these friends I've had for over half a decade have essentially \"dumped\" me.\n\nWhat do?", "subreddit": "lonely"}

{"post_id": "byosqf", "created_utc": 1560112679, "title": "About the Sub, Common Misconceptions, and an In-depth Look at the Rules", "author": "Takei_Me", "self_text": "Hello everyone and welcome to r/foreveralone ! Foreveralone was founded several years ago. It was originally a subreddit to share the forever alone meme, but somewhere down the line, it turned into an identity and a place where people who have been alone most of their lives could come and talk about their issues.\n\nI'm here to clear up some common misconceptions that get asked in this sub as well as to explain the rules more in depth, and show how to give your posts appropriate flairs.\n\n##Common Misconceptions\n\n**Why don't you hire an escort?**\n\nWhat I find here is that for most users, it's not about sex. It's about finding someone you have a connection with and being able to trust someone that much to be able to be intimate with them. Paying for an escort, while not only expensive and risky, defeats the purpose of finding someone who wants you for you and will not solve the loneliness people feel here. Similarly, telling a girl to sleep with any willing guy also fits here. One night stands for anyone, payed for or not, do not fill the void for feeling loved.\n\n**Have you tried lifting/exercise/shaving/changing clothes/showering/etc?**\n\nThis is demeaning advice. If you want to give a user here advice, ask them more about themselves. Assuming that the person has done nothing to change can be insulting, especially if that person has been doing these things for a while with no results, so to say. Blanket advice doesn't necessarily break any rules. It's just not useful because every user here has their own set of unique problems.\n\n**Why is this place so toxic?**\n\nYes, I understand from an outside view it may seem like that. But in reality, it's just a bunch of lonely people venting and getting things off their chest. Realize that the users here don't act like this in real life. Personally, If I've learned anything, especially in the FA chatroom, most of the users here seem normal and do not \"complain\" about their lives 24/7. People see what they want to see, and more often than not, people come here with the notion that this place is toxic, misogynistic, hateful, etc. Are there some users here like that? Absolutely, but don't let the vocal minority drown out the rest of the people here who just have been given bad cards in life.\n\n**There are starving children who have it worse than you, appreciate what you have**\n\nWhile this may seem like a good way to put life in perspective, it doesn't really help the person who is hearing it. Everyone has it a little better than someone else, but that also means that everyone is a little worse off than someone else. Hearing that someone has it more worse in life doesn't make the person feel any better about their own situation and minimizes their life experience.\n\n**Have you tried lowering your standards?**\n\nPeople are allowed to have a set of standards. It's what keeps people from having unfulfilling relationships. It's not fair to anyone to ask out someone you're not attracted to on the basis of \"lowering your standards\".\n\n**You're not entitled to an SO**\n\nWe know we aren't entitled to anything and we certainly aren't claiming that we are. People are just venting and wishing that they did have an SO. Wishing to be with another person (\"I wish I found an SO\") is not the same as being entitled (\"I deserve to have an SO!!\").\n\n*These are just a handful of misconceptions that come to mind. I know there are others but I feel these ones are the more bigger ones.*\n\n## The Rules\n\n**Rule 1: Be polite, friendly and welcoming**\n\nBasically, just be nice please. Even if you are having a heated debate, there is no need to be rude towards each other, keep it civilised. We will not tolerate comments such as fuck off/you, get out, kill yourself, this is why you're foreveralone, or any other insult or harmful wishing you can think of. Keep the subreddit safe!\n\n**Rule 2: Do not tell anyone they're not foreveralone enough to be here**\n\nThe infamous Rule 2. Let me explain as best I can. Being *foreveralone* is a made up concept and identity, it isn't so black and white. Because of this, it's hard to have a set definition of what is and isn't considered foreveralone. Being FA is more like a gradient of a thousand colors. It can span as far as a kissless virgin who has no friends and has never had an SO, to the person with no friends but paid an escort, to the person with friends but no SO, to the person who may have had a month long relationship years ago but is now in their 30s with no hope of the future. The list can go on and on and the experiences of people vary too much to say \"you're not FA enough\". I find the best \"definition\" of FA is this: *Someone who has a very difficult time creating or maintaining relationships, either platonic or romantic. Someone who suffers from chronic loneliness*\n\n**Rule 3: Do not post inflammatory comments or threads designed to generalize, demean, insult or otherwise degrade an entire group of people**\n\nGeneralizations never turn out well and should be avoided as much as possible. For example, the generalization that all FAs are fat, unclean neckbeards hurts because, obviously, the people here are not like that. So please, don't generalize other groups of people, there will be people who don't fit the so called description.\n\n**Rule 4: Any incel references, slang, or inference will be deemed hate speech and met with a ban**\n\nThis is *not* an incel sub. We do not affiliate ourselves in any way with incels. There is a clear distinction between Foreveralone and incels, to say otherwise is being ignorant. Slang such as \"femoids, black pill, cuck, etc\" are not allowed and will most likely end up in a ban.\n\n**Rule 5: Avoid posts that serve only to advertise other subreddits or external sites**\n\nThere are plenty of other more suitable places to advertise websites and r/foreveralone is not the place.\n\n**Rule 6: If you see trolling, report it**\n\nTrolls are not welcome and usually break most of the rules when posting. Please [report any trolling](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%23ForeverAlone&amp;subject=Trolling) you see to the mods and we will deal with them. *Do not engage with them.*\n\n**Rule 7: Any posts created to intentionally start drama on any subject will be removed. This also includes Meta conversations about the sub or Moderation Policy.**\n\nThreads that call out users or other subreddits are not welcome. Keep your vendettas to yourself. All these kinds of threads do is attract brigades and they always turn into a flame war. *They will be removed.* If you have questions about the moderation policy, you are welcome to [message the mods](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FForeverAlone) about it.\n\n**Rule 8: Don't post your dick**\n\nYes, this happened one too many times for it to be rule. Nobody here wants to see it, and there are certainly way better places to post those kinds of pictures. This goes for any kind of explicit NSFW post.\n\n**Rule 9: If you have been muted by the mods during a PM conversation, don't message their personal account**\n\nIf you happen to have been muted, there certainly was a reason for it. Messaging a mod directly in their personal Reddit account amplifies the issue and can end up in a ban.\n\n*I hope this post can clear things up for you fellow redditors. If you have any other questions, don't hesitate to send me or the mods a PM.*\n\n##Link Flairs\n\nThere are three tags that you can give to your post, depending on what you are writing. Make a thread, just as you normally would. Once you submit, you will see an option saying \"flair\" right under your thread (after the report and nsfw tags). Click this and three options will show up. Click on the most appropriate one and save it.\n\n**Success Stories**: any success, whether it's getting a date or getting a girlfriend/boyfriend, share the story along with what you did and how you got there.\n\n**Advice Wanted**: for threads where users can ask for advice on anything, from things to improve on to what to do on a date.\n\n**Venting thread**: for people who just want to vent out their frustration about whatever is bothering them, and for those who do not want any advice, just people to listen.\n\nIf you have a post that *does not* fit any of these categories (for example, a song, picture, general discussion, etc), you *do not* have to tag your post!\n\nTo any users making comments in these tagged threads, please respect what thread you are commenting on. For example, we should not see advice giving on venting threads.", "subreddit": "ForeverAlone"}

All this time (my whole life) I have been kind of alone, not just in the GF department, but also with friends. Sure, I have (had) friends, but they are never really close to me. Now in this period of my life where I am working to make something of myself I was just wondering what it's all worth. \n\nIt always makes me happy to share important moments in my life with other people who are me dear and having those people do the same with me. Not having people who care about me around me just makes me not care about myself and anything I do or achieve. I think this is largely the problem of me just not being good in reading people and talking to them. Not being a social butterfly I don't know how to take a conversation beyond the \"hey, how are you doing?\" and never reach dat deeper space.

They got together extremely well, maybe too well, so well they just, forgot about me. Not the usual forgot about me part, nah that wouldve been too nice: yknow, we did somethings together but then, I found out that the reason why they almost never called me is that because they did everything between them, and just never called me. The thing that really woke me up is during a convo on a social media with them, I asked them if we could go out together, and then, they said \"yeah i already got something planned, dont you remember, you still up for this right?\" and the other said \"ah yeah, cool yep i am\". \n\nThis just, killed me. Another event with them is in college before I left it for another one, whereas I saw one of my friend there, didnt saw him for like, 6 months, and he just, fucking walked past me like he didnt saw me. I was so fucking angry, and sad. This was one of the reason I left this college for another one. If your thinking he just didnt noticed me, well, I saw him after class, when we went home, he saw me, and wasnt even bothered by my presence. fuck this shit\n\n\nNow, I figured it out; they were never my friends in the first place. Nobody I actually know in real life is actually my friend. Most of the current contacts I have are people asking me for some college shit. Most of them talk to me only for this stuff.

I'm 21, don't have a license, work a dead end job and never had a boyfriend.\n\nOn top of feeling like I'll never be anything, I deal with a lot of anxiety and depression. I always feel like I'm useless, that nobody needs me, \"what's so great about me anyway?\". And ironically I feel like I'll be lonely forever, but also feel like I deserve to be alone. Like I just don't deserve happiness.\n\nMy parents divorced when I was young. Their relationship just grew more and more toxic and eventually they just ended it. This is pretty much where it started. Where I started feeling like a burden and that things would be better if I just wasn't here. I still think that way, sometimes.\n\nI see my father often. He's turned himself into a good man. He doesn't drink anymore and watches his health closely. Unfortunately, after the divorce, he moved out and things just became tense between us. Like I just couldn't be myself around him anymore. I love him and he says he's proud of me and loves me, but part of me just feels like that's not true. This weekend (meeting up with family members from his side of the family) solidified that thought again.

Though the past few years she has been struggling with her own depression and breast cancer, which might possibly be coming around again. I've noticed she's not really herself anymore, and her habits just rub me the wrong way sometimes. I love her, I really do, but I just can't help but push her away. She's not the mom I knew anymore.\n\nI know I'm only 21, things could get better from here. I do have plans to get my license soon but I'm not very confident in getting behind the wheel. \n\nMaybe one day I will get a boyfriend/a relationship but it just feels like I won't ever establish that connection.

The hours suck (I work nights so no life for me anyway) and the atmosphere is just so god awful and toxic. I know I should just move onto another job but it'll be hard adjusting to the new environment/pay difference. It also jabs into my working experience.\n\nI don't go to college mainly because I don't want to. It's not a lie, I just don't really have a drive/passion to pursue in anything for a degree. There's also the financial burden that comes on top of that, and if I went and still felt like it wasn't for me, then I'd regret it more than I already am for not going.\n\nI know I'm only 21, I haven't even been out of school for 3 years yet and all the girls my age are literally popping out babies left and right. Some are engaged. Some of my friends are graduated from college, or are pursuing a dream of theirs. I envy them so much. I don't even know what I want to do with my life it's that pathetic.\n\nI've got no confidence in my looks. I dress like a tomboy, sweatshirts and baggy clothes. People tell me I'm cute and stuff all the time but I can just never see it. I used to be bullied back in elementary school really bad for my overbite. Long story short I got a couple of (broken) molars removed and it's receded back quite a bit. It's not very noticeable, I hope.\n\nI think that's the end of that. There was no main point to this post, really. I've just got a lot on my mind and I just wanted to let some things out. I'm afraid to tell my family or friends about all this because then I'll feel like I'm burdening/annoying them. I really don't want to bother anyone.\n\nPart of me still hopes that it'll get better one day. I have to. It's gotta get better, right?\n\nAnd PS the username is a phrase from the song \"Rolling Girl\" by Hatsune Miku (wowaka). \"mou ikkai\" means \"one more time\". I relate to this song so deeply, even after 10 years. I feel like some people in this Reddit would relate/enjoy it as well.", "subreddit": "lonely"}

I have kissed a girl before, but it's still a huge deal for me. Other people kiss on a daily basis and they have no problem kissing a baby.

I just got no idea how my parents didnt think twice about me being skin and bones and the importance of animal foods especially fat for healthy brain function and growth, like even the girls in school were bigger than me. I just cant imagine I had the nutrients to grow into an adult. You dont see big well developed men (skeletal structure) who grew up on small amounts of calories and food like grains. No, they ate beef, chicken, milk, eggs, a shit tonne of animal food. It just sucks that my fate was at another hands, and they were unable to raise me correctly.

I related to a lot of the stories I\u2019d read here and I\u2019m pretty sure I posted some of my own stuff. Well I just wanted to get this off my chest... Hope exists. I was easily the most hopeless pessimistic person you could find up until two weeks ago. I\u2019m only 18 years old, so I understand there are those on here much older who\u2019ve had it worse, but I just want to share my story. I\u2019d been on and off of every single dating app there is for the past six months just trying to find SOMEBODY. I\u2019ve never had a girlfriend of course, never been kissed, never even had a girl tell me I\u2019m attractive. My whole life. I would get brief self esteem boosts when I\u2019d match with an attractive girl on Tinder, but that would quickly fade when they\u2019d ghost me or never respond in the first place. Oddly enough, I\u2019d found the most success on tinder out of all the dating apps, despite it being mostly for hookups. I found that girls were more willing to chat on this app compared to others. But still it just became a time killer, mindlessly swiping. Sometimes I\u2019d see girls so attractive that I\u2019d swipe no just because I knew it wasn\u2019t even worth it. That\u2019s how fucked up my psyche was. Finally on May 28th, I matched with a beautiful girl. I sent her an awkward/funny message as I\u2019ve gotten used to doing at this point. She responds. We chat back and forth for a little while, and I knew something was different the moment we bonded over being broken. It was with a laughing emoji but she said we\u2019re both damaged. I took my shot and asked if we could text so I could get off this awful app. She sent me her number. That first night we texted for hours before saying good night to each other. That\u2019s the most I\u2019d ever gotten in my whole life. It\u2019s been two weeks now, and we\u2019ve texted almost every day, for hours at a time. I asked her out the second day but she wanted to wait because she\u2019s been hurt before. We know each other so well now that when we do go out for the first time this Friday, it\u2019s not gonna be awkward at all. She knows I\u2019m a virgin, doesn\u2019t care. She knows I\u2019ve never kissed anyone, doesn\u2019t care. And she thinks I\u2019m attractive and \u201camazing\u201d..... there\u2019s the mic drop moment. Idk if anyone has taken the time to read this, I just really needed to get all that off my chest. If I had read a post like this 3 months ago, I probably would\u2019ve cried, or got angry, and destructive, but I think it\u2019s important to get this out there. The minute we stop trying is the minute there\u2019s no hope. Yes, the odds are against us, the universe is against us, but we need to fight back. If we\u2019re always prepared, luck will find us eventually. It\u2019s the Law of Averages. Thank you to this community for making me feel not so alone, ironically.

There's seriously so many people out there like me that feel they have no one. So many people stay up at night and hurt emotionally like i do and feel empty like i do. It's fucking weird. We're seriously the ones who try hardest and still have no one so we take the pain of it instead of the hugs and the relationships. So I look at all the posts again after thinking this and i feel one thing. Love. I love you. I love everyone reading this. We relate so why should i feel something different? We're all looking for the same thing but it's fucking difficult. I love you because you keep looking. You wouldn't have come back here if you didn't. You're all loveable. Don't lose hope.

I guess I don't know what else to say, or how to say it. Never talked about my feelings being an only child. Lots of feelings I have pent up, but I do not know how to express them. Maybe I should get a dictionary haha. Well anyone read this maybe you can find comfort in knowing you aren't \"alone\" in how lonely you feel.", "subreddit": "lonely"}

But before anyone gets started, I should note a few things about my question.\n\n1). Dating a transgender woman isn't an easy solution to being FA.  Most passable transsexuals (i.e. trans-women who are easily mistaken for cis-women) have probably even higher standards than most cis-women, particularly when it comes to how masculine the guys are.  I've rarely seen any transwomen with guys who weren't big, tall, and super manly.\n\n2). Trans-women in porn don't top.  Despite what you may have seen in porn, transgirls don't like, uh, being the pitcher.  In fact, it's pretty much impossible to find in a t-girl who isn't an escort who does that sort of thing because trans-women pretty much always want to be treated like women.  That means they catch, they don't pitch, so don't worry about that being an issue if it bothers you.\n\n3). Not being open to dating a trans-woman doesn't make you a bigot, \"transphobic\" or any other such bullshit.  You wouldn't call a gay man a misogynist because he's not interested in dating women, right?  Pretty much every transwoman I've met respects that people have their preferences, as long as it isn't a dehumanizing fetish and the guy isn't being a dick about not being into this sort of thing.\n\nI learned a lot about the subject primarily because I grew up in the SF Bay Area, which is the LGTBQA+++ capital of the US and actually know people in the community.  So now that this is all out of the way, I am curious as to how some of the guys here would react if they were actually approached by a girl who happened to have something a little different.\n\np.s. don't be a dick when responding please.", "subreddit": "ForeverAlone"}

I got a better haircut. I started taking better care of myself, especially my appearance. I had the whole works done. I feel like a better person, and a better man for doing all of that. I generally feel better.\n\nHowever... Every single time I pursue a girl, I fail. At first I thought it was me.

Whether it be molded by the world, or came out from the womb that way -- **somehow** we were all made this way.

Her softness, her sheer femininity, is soul soothing.  It takes a 10/10 bad day to a 2/10 in an instant.  Her smile, her voice, brings an incredible calm.  My love language is touch, I crave it constantly.  The little things like running my fingers along her arm, playing with her hair, or her nails against my skin, my hair, just keeps me centered.  I haven\u2019t had anyone to make this connection with in years, and it\u2019s painful.  It\u2019s painful seeing couples being intimate, knowing I have no one to come home to.

It pushes everyone to be alone and independent like it's the best thing ever but now we have this loneliness epidemic going on because of it. It makes no sense often times.\n\nWhen I lived in Asia the culture made it normal for family members to all live together, even extended family. Even married men would live with their relatives.\n\nAnd as someone who's lived alone and with extended family I have to say I prefer the extended family lifestyle. It's much less lonely since it's kind of like a party all the time. I'd come home and play cards and video games with my cousins and uncles and there was always a big feast for the entire family to sit and socialize. You also have such a good support system since there's so many people backing you up. You essentially sacrifice privacy for company.\n\nI also notice with Western culture that it's more common to dislike your family. It's common to not get along and I often wonder if that's because of the \"me me me\" mentality where we always think about what is convenient for us and what we want and it makes us less accommodating towards other people, including our family. \n\nI live alone now because my parents (it's just us now in the West) have adopted the Western culture and told me I had to move out and they didn't care if I became homeless.\n\nOne of things I was never prepared for when living alone was how lonely the silence is. I think this is the reason people like to have the tv on in the background. \n\nWhen I'd come home from school back when I lived with my family there was always someone there to greet me. I'd come home and my cousin would tell me he bought a new video game and wanted us to play it. Sometimes I'd help my younger cousins with their homework or help my uncle with fixing the lawnmower. \n\nNow I come home to silence and darkness. And instead of sitting at a table with 10-15 family members and having a good laugh with them all and then getting drunk and singing karaoke late into the night, I just heat up my food and sit in front of a computer to socialize with people online because I have no one else.\n\nI want to go back, but things are so fucked and complicated now and I haven't kept contact with anyone that I feel like a stranger to them now.", "subreddit": "ForeverAlone"}

I was thinking about suicide every day and felt so incredibly bad. Today is a better day though. I think I'm finally starting to accept that I'm not made like other people.\n\nI've always felt different. When I talk to people I can't relate to them and they can't relate to me. It's as if we were different species. As if there was a wall between us preventing any kind of bonding. As if I wasn't even human.\n\nI've tried for years, but went nowhere. I feel like I'm finally done. I'm turning 30 real soon. I did have one relationship once tho. She was abusive and ended up committing suicide. She was the only one that somewhat cared for me and it was only because she was insane and I was an easy target. Since then, nothing.\n\nI get the usual \"you're cute\" \"you're a nice guy\" \"oh you'll find someone, you're still young\" yeah sure buddy. Worst part is that my loneliness means I didn't develop all these life experiences that my coworkers talk about all the time. Break times are the worst because of that. They talk about all the things they did in their life, they bond, they laugh, and all I can do is sit there awkwardly, feign a smile and contemplate how different and hopeless I am.\n\nWhat's the point. No woman cares about me. I developed a crush on a coworker and for some days it made me quite depressed. That's because I thought we had a chance. I dunno why. Clearly she doesn't actually care about me. We go along well but that's probably only because we're coworkers and time has to pass.\n\nI've always thought that happiness wasn't for me. Happiness, love, a real life, all these things...? They're made for other people. Not for me.

This coworker of mine? No point in being depressed anymore she'll never care about me and no one will. Happiness? Who the fuck cares if I don't have it. I'll never have it. A normal regular life? Heh. It's for other people. A family? No sir. Someone to message me when I'm away from work because I'm sick? People to do things with outside of work? Someone to create a life and a future with? Nah. Nothing. Nothing but emptiness.\n\nEmptiness is my only true reality. I don't even have regrets or desires anymore when I see happy people or couples. Why would I? These things were not made for me. I'll always be alone, hopeless and desperate. \n\nI'm just waiting eagerly for the blessed day where death will finally free me from this hell. No regrets anymore.

From my teens to adulthood I've always struggled to find my people. To find anyone at all that I can feel close to. The fact that I'm still struggling at this age depresses me beyond description. \n\nThis morning I woke up feeling ok. Tried to talk to family members, just normal chit chat, and was met with grumpiness and dismissal. Gave up on that fast. They have always clung to each other more than me, and they actively push me away nowadays.\n\nReflected on my day yesterday...conversation with other female co-workers that was filled with underlying snark and competitiveness on their part - who has the better marriage, kids, family-life - that kind of thing. I was barely involved since I have none of those things, and the competitive subtext made me vaguely sick to be honest. So, unsatisfying and unfulfilling interactions. \n\nAnd that's it. That's my life. I've tried pretty hard to put myself out there as someone who is innately shy and reserved. Yet at this point I have nothing but loneliness, and a feeling of being an outsider everywhere I go. I've tried to bond with people and been rejected. And the universe seems to get a kick out of keeping me around people, sometimes very different people, who become tight friends almost to the point where it's weird, everywhere I go.

It probably wasn't the best date she ever had, and I was kinda awkward sometimes, but it was okay. We kept talking and all that, and I still loved being with her.\n\nThere was a second date. It's the only time I've ever gotten a second date in my life. We'd just finished our morning Kendo class, went home to get changed, then went to see a movie together. After that, I brought her to visit the bazaar for awhile, then we went to this video game cafe, and finally got dinner. We were together for the whole day, from 9am to 1130pm, and it was the absolute best day of my life. If I had died that night and the Devil asked me if it was a life well-lived, I'd have to actually pause and think about it. That day could've made up for all the pain in this life. Getting to spend the whole day with such an amazing girl... I'd trade everything just to live that day again, and again, and again.\n\nBut life went on. A new guy joined our Kendo class recently, and she's been talking to him so much. Today I had dinner with all of them, and... It hurt. It hurt so much. To see her purposefully walk beside him, stand beside him. She's usually very introverted, but she talked to him so much. The worst part was the way she smiled at him and looked at him. There's always someone better than me. She's never smiled at me like that before, never looked at me like that before. There's always someone better than me.\n\nI'm always rolling the same boulder up the same mountain, and I always get crushed just the same. It always ends like this. Someone better. Either that someone comes along, or she *knows* that someone will come along. I'm never good enough. But I thought now might be different. I really, really believed that maybe *this time,* I'd get to love someone and be loved back. Maybe *this time*, I'd have my chance at happiness. Maybe *this time*, I'd finally be what someone wants.\n\nI can't keep going. I can't do it. If it's always gonna be like this, why bother? I've been begging for someone all my life.

I live in a small city where there are not many opportunities to meet new people. I am 29, female, single, and live with my parents. I've mostly been single. Back when I was in school, I was relentlessly bullied. I don't get out of the house because I don't have any friends and I never get invited anywhere. I had to resort to making friends online. I went on Words with Friends and a guy had befriended me on there. He would talk to me everyday and seemed genuinely interested in my life and how I was doing.  6 months ago, he asked me to be his girlfriend and I said yes as I truly loved and trusted him. He had asked me to marry him and we made many plans in advance. I got all of my immigration papers ready to move to Ireland to be with him. I was ready to leave everything I had here in Canada to get married to him. I went to a lawyer, bought new luggage and travel essentials, paid for all my plane tickets, paid for everything I needed for myself and for this move to Ireland, which was a total of $8K from my savings. I told people I was getting married as well. We talked everyday until 9 days ago. He suddenly stopped texting and phoning me and I tried to get a hold of him. It was not like him not to phone or text, so I was worried for his wellbeing. I lost sleep and stopped eating because I was so worried about him because I loved him so much. This morning he emailed me telling me he found someone else, that he got her pregnant and this was why he was not talking to me. I was floored. I invested a lot of time, money and energy into this relationship. The money that I had spent for the move was from my savings which I had received from financial benefits for victims of crime, because I was sexually and physically abused. Another part of that money was from 2 student awards that I worked so hard for by getting the highest grades out of anyone in the program I was in. All because I believed and trusted in someone, and wanted to be loved and have companionship. All because I tried to have faith that something was real. I was wrong and I am taking it so hard because I was burnt so badly and rejected by everyone I have tried to believe in in the past with both guys and also friendships. After receiving the email, my mind was in a blur, and I reached my breaking point and tried to hang myself in the bathroom because the pain is too much for me to bear. I'm now trying to move past everything but its extremely difficult. I am so isolated and I have nobody to talk to which is adding to how crushed I feel right now.", "subreddit": "lonely"}

Never had success with it before. She wasn't pretty and moreover overweight, but since I dont get many matches and even less conversations, I gave it a try. We started to chat in this app. The conversation became more intense, but not sexual. She just told me things she struggles with currently and so one. We changed to Whatsapp then, and chatted even more.\n\nSuddenly, she send me pics of her wearing a dress. I replied to it and she send me even more. We conversation became more sexual and suddenly she asked me, if i want to have sex with her. I couldn't believe it. It never happened to me before. I dont know why but I said yes,  although I did not find her attractive.  We had an appointment for the same day,\n\nand I took the train, because she lives about 30 km away ( everything happened in one day here, just a reminder).\n\nHer apartment wasn't far away from the train station, so I was quick there. It was kinda weird, I still don't know if I liked this whole thing or not. We had sex, about three times. I stayed  approximately 3 hours there.\n\nI don't go more into the specifics here. \n\nThe reason I'm posting this here is the way I feeled about this afterwards. It changed absolute nothing, I even feel myself kinda used. Many guys here on this subreddit complaining about being virgin or havin no sex in general, but this is absolutely not the reason why we feel FA. It's about love, not sex. I've learned my lesson.

I stopped exercising, stopped eating properly, stopped socializing, sleep schedule annihilated, and my grades at university had plummeted. A lot of this I attribute to the rejection but it wasn't just that, it wasn't that specific rejection that sent me on that spiral. At that time in my life I was the fittest I had ever been (far into normal BMI range), the most confident I had ever been, and the high self-esteem I had ever garnered. It is hard to think back then, but I must've felt like I wouldn't die alone, and to think that and still get rejected is what put me over the tipping point. Maybe it would've been different if I kept self-betterment, maybe 6 months down the line I would've found someone. But it is too late and the damage has been done.

It's almost over and I'm happy about it but more then that, I am depressed/lonely/sad. Ever since i was a very young kid I was loved by everyone, had good grades and no one had a problem with me. Basically i was the good kid. And last year I got super close with all my friends. But this year everything changed. They all started drinking/smoking/vaping, they wanted me to do it with them, but this is where our ways parted. I just didn't want do it, because of my complicated past with my father and i didn't want to dissapoint my mom, I didn't want to become someone i wasn't. Following that, they stopped inviting me to hang out and left me completely out of it. They think that we are still buddy buddies, but we're not. I see them sending me snaps of them going out and I'm just at home crying nearly every day, thinking how did I end up like this, what did I do wrong to not have any friends anymore and I just feel so lonely. I can't make friends easily, because I think that I'm a complex person and talking to someone I don't know is like the hardest thing in the world. I just don't know how I'm gonna get through 2 more years of this hell...\n\nRomance doesn't work well for me either. This year I met a girl through a mutual friend and thought she was really different from all the girls and she wasn't doing any drugs either, which i really admire. The 1st conversation we had brought me hope that I finally won't be alone anymore and that I found someone that will finally love me back, but it ended up different than usual it still felt like rejection. I started chatting with her from time to time and I felt something special, I thought she did aswell and every time we meet she just smiles so nicely at me and I can't tell if it's because she is friendly or because she just felt bad for me, because i have no friends. 1 month after i asked her out and she replied \"Oh i can't i have a lot of homework\" and i got really sad and thought \"ok maybe that's true, I'll try again next time\". Next time didn't go better either, she just said she can't, no reason, no interest to hang out another day. After that i just stopped messaging her, because i thought she just didn't care anymore. 6 months passed and now we're here. I saw her at school again and straight out of the blue just fell back in love with her, I have no idea what happened, probably a mood swing, but I just couldn't stop thinking about her. So I decided to write a long message telling her how I feel and to my surprise she said \"It's very nice to get a message like this, I'll find time for you some day\". And i felt on top of the world, but a week has passed and I'm losing hope, my imagination is too big and I'm just thinking of the worst scenarios, because I've been hurt so much that I don't trust anyone anymore. To top all of that off, I saw my best friend (one of the guys who i talked about earlier, so not really best friend but its hard to describe it) chatting with her a bit and I just got a million emotions inside of me. I was sad, mad, jealous and I wanted to cry so much, but I was in class so I managed not to. Even if she'd go out with me I'm still really scared. I've never been on a date with a girl and I don't know what I'm supposed to do, how much should I open up, what if she just likes me as a friend and it gets worse every day, just waiting for a miracle to happen yet being afraid of the miracle itself. \n\nEnglish isn't my main language so I didn't manage to put it in the best way and I know that many people here have it much worse, but I just feel so down, this has never happened to me before and I feel just so lost, when I see others being succesfull I just look down on myself thinking, why am I such a failure....\n\nIf anyone would care, It would mean the world to me.", "subreddit": "lonely"}

{"post_id": "bzz1ka", "created_utc": 1560385970, "title": "A dumb narrative to hopefully distract your lonely woes", "author": "Nausea_", "self_text": "So here's a fun story of my obsessive mental tendencies to hopefully ease the loneliness of all of us. There's a new girl at my work who caught my eye as soon as I was introduced. The ordeal feels hazy in my recollection, and I often associate this haziness with a heavy attraction. I've felt it before, a few times prior. It's the same as feeling lost when you look at someone in their eyes. Sappy, right? I like to think that she felt the same.\n\nJust kidding. Well, sort of. I'm not crazy, I can separate mental fiction from reality. But as soon as the thought is introduced within the realm of possibilities, what else do you do? You pluck at it and flirt with it. Wrap yourself in it; get it in every nook, and don't you dare miss a spot. It's not my choice, anyways... these things just appear and reappear in the mind without permission. Now, already, this poor woman is my mental subject due to a simple greeting, one of which was entirely out of her control. This is life's fate in the modern corporate era - yes my children, I knew your mother was the one as soon as we exchanged a half-hearted shake of our hands at my cubicle. I knew she felt the same as soon as I lightly said a greeting and lost half of the message to my mumbling. This conversation between myself and the children takes place among all four of us at some small cafe on a cool Saturday morning, sun in the lightly overcast sky, with our two darling children probing away with questions of their historical origins. I ordered pancakes and meat, she's more of a parfait girl. Get the picture?\n\nOver the course of two weeks I have had multiple conversations with her in my head; pounding away at her poor, defenseless soul with my endless virtues, truths, and beliefs - all while she simply takes it in and maybe nods. She already knows my childhood woes, my dearest insecurities, and some of my home-Ec skills. When the day gets difficult, and I get wrapped up in my emotions leading me to completely question the purpose of it all, her image appears in my head. It's pure meaning, her image telling me to improve myself; the image is something to admire, something to respect, something to love, something to work toward, and to claim that it's mine. Something to stick around for. I think of the mutually beneficial outcomes of our exchanged nurturing, and I think of how we could make choices together that would not merely just give life meaning - but how it would maximize our short existences with pleasure, understanding, and happiness. I think of how any two people can do that, and the magic that it entails. I think about what they can accomplish from it all, and what we can all accomplish from it, collectively.\n\nI've spoken with her a few times not in my head; no mention of virtue, philosophy, or belief.  And especially nothing of our children, the representative permutations of our respective ancestries, fit with the peculiar features that would only occur from the combination of the two of us.  But I have learned recently that her favorite fruit are grapes.  Everything's coming up, Milhouse!  \n\nIsn't it something? It's a choice few steps and a few words. That's all it would take for all of this to unravel. The freedom of it gives me nausea, and the choice to ignore it gives me sadness.  But what bites most is that I'm stuck fighting some demons with dumb mental impressions and illusions of things that don't happen because my stupid brain has some bad chemicals in it.", "subreddit": "lonely"}

From the original post, I did take some of the advice for bettering myself by involving myself in hobbies such as photography, basketball, etc but it seems that the friends I was afraid of losing originally are being lost. For the last few weeks it seems that I\u2019ve not only been brushed off, but my existence itself online has been invisible to them. Every message or image I send in our group chat is mostly ignored or they move past it. I\u2019m happy to be improving myself but what\u2019s happening now is making me feel like I\u2019ll have no one in the end. Though my parents and older brother are still being positive, I know I can\u2019t just only speak with them. Telling them I feel isn\u2019t a valid solution either as they\u2019ve had past complicated family relations causing them to be sour about the idea of having friends except for my older brother. The issue I have for ditching them and moving on is that some of these friends have been with me since I moved here and met them in elementary school and I never thought to lose them, and if I do ditch them I will have no where to turn as I always thought we would be friends. It just hurts and frustrates me now to think that the friends that were kind to accept me have just isolated me and left me behind. They\u2019ve posted images of them doing stuff and whenever I message them to do something I\u2019m just met with no response which I guess would have been the first warning. I\u2019ve already thought about and went through messages sent if I said something wrong or distasteful but I haven\u2019t really found anything unordinary or unusual to cause that. Anyways I just need help figuring what I should do wether it be to seriously speak with them or split away from the group.", "subreddit": "lonely"}

In high school, it was a socially isolated kinda loneliness. I was the book smart nerdy girl who dedicated all her time to getting straight As to satisfy a deeply rooted need for perfection and mask the fact that I didn't have a real friend group or social life. I wanted one, but I didn't feel like I connected with people. It didn't help that social interactions *exhausted* me. I remember coming home from a friends house one day and just crying.\n\nJunior/senior year this got a little better, especially when I pushed my way into those cliche rebellious teen activities. Drinking and smoking with my peers made me feel like one of them. Not in a peer pressure way. Just in a breaking out of my comfort zone kinda way. I also developed some friendships a bit more.\n\nLast fall I started college and shit took a turn for the worst. I felt so isolated and spent a lot of time on my dorm bed too depressed to move. I started sneaking sips of vodka here and there. There were a lot of factors to my depression, including some grief and trauma, but the loneliness was by far the worst part. Things got bad and then almost too bad, but I managed to get on SSRIs over fall break.\n\nGoing into spring semester, aided by Lexapro, I decided to take charge and try new things. Like many young women, I have a pretty complicated relationship with my body. For a pretty long time I really beleived that no man would ever be interested in me sexually. Like I viewed myself as some sort of atrocity. These body image issues, coupled with a reputation as the not-super-social book smart girl, kept me from being sexually active in high school.\n\nCome spring semester, I did the obvious thing and downloaded Tinder. Don't get me wrong, I'm really fucking horny all the time. And that's a big reason I've been having a lot of casual sex. But there's other reasons as well. It's nice just to be in someone's arms, really. Cuddling fucking rocks. But I still feel lonely afterwards because of how casual it all is. My hookups, whether one-time or ongoing, have all been with college seniors, and sometimes even with guys a bit older. So obviously nothing serious has come of any of these, even though I've sometimes felt feelings. I find I feel loneliest when I think about whether or not these guys actually appreciate my company or just see me as a body. It's funny because I never thought this would end up being a concern because I couldn't fathom that men would be attracted to me. After years of hating my body, learning that I can be attractive and even sexy just feels so exciting. I've even gotten pretty into sending nudes. In the absence of actual emotional connection, I've become kinda an attention whore. I guess the summary of this cluster fuck of a paragraph is that casual sex reminds me of my loneliness but I keep doing it because a) I'm horny and b) it makes me temporarily less lonely.\n\nSex life aside, spring semester was more socially fulfilling than fall. I got much closer to two of the guys on my hall, and I feel comfortable opening up to them. Not in quite this much detail, but they know much more about my life than most people. And that's been pretty nice. But even with them, I still feel lonely all the time. Like I could be sitting with them spilling my deepest shit and feel completely alone.\n\nSo fast forward to right now. Here I am alone in my house while my parents away, meowing back and forth with my cat. Please send virtual hugs.", "subreddit": "lonely"}

First of all, if you have to ask, the answer is no.  Secondly, men overwhelmingly tend to interpret signals of friendliness from chicks they are into as flirting when it's not far more often than the other way around (source: https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/men-and-women-cant-be-just-friends/).\n\nBut for those who are still not convinced, I have always advised men to actually hang around other attractive men to see how women behave with them, how their body language changes and how they look at men they are into to see what this actually looks like.  This exercise changed my life in that it stopped me from hating myself for \"passing up opportunities\" that never actually existed, except in my head.  It will probably do the same for you and you finally stop letting regret eat away at your spirit.\n\nHowever, for those who still doubt me (or those who have no hot friends), I have a treat.  I found a video of a perfect example of what legit low-key flirting looks like, from both a guy and a chick.  Fair warning: **if the idea of checking out two people who are sickeningly into each other is suicide fuel for you, kindly move along.**  Oh yeah, and the people in this video are asian so for the racist pieces of shit who are bothered by that too, feel free to move along as well (and f u, btw).\n\nVideo: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_L2tEZ6swUQ", "subreddit": "ForeverAlone"}

I went to University and I told a friend of mine, \"Every girl here is so attractive, I don't understand!\", and he said, \"no, these people just have money, it's the makeup.\" It was an expensive University, so I was like oh, okay. But none of the girls wore makeup... Then I noticed that I kept seeing above-average-looking girls on the street. I thought it was strange. How could everyone be beautiful? And then it dawned on me. How stupid could I be? Of course, most girls seemed pretty to me because I was ugly. Since I saw my face every day in the mirror I thought that was \"average\". But it wasn't. By definition most people can't be above average... It was an earth-shattering realization to me.\n\nOne day I decided to start dating. I enrolled in a speed-dating thingy. It was at around 9pm. That afternoon I went for a run. I was wearing a baggy hoodie and some old leggings. I was panting, sweaty, my neck was forward and my bum was back, my ponytail was all messy. So I was running back home, and I went past a group of guys, and one said, \"How about this one?\", and his friend said, \"No! She looks like a donkey!\", and they all laughed. In fairness, I did. It didn't affect me much at the time. I went to the speed-dating thing anyway, after some deliberation. I tried to become beautiful. (Spoiler: I didn't). So, I went and it was a lot of fun. I 'selected' 4 of the guys, and I got 2 matches. Only one sent me a message. We went on a date and we didn't click much at all. The second guy that had matched with me had probably just selected all girls, to see how many matches he got. I wanted to do that too --select all guys--, because in the end I was there for statistics more than romance. But I didn't want to give anyone false hope, so I didn't in the end. Out of all the guys I wanted to see again, 75% didn't want to see me back. Okay.\n\nIf you're a girl and you wanna know if you're ugly, pay attention to what people say. If you don't get many compliments on your looks, but when you do they're \"you \\*look\\* so pretty! that dress \\*looks\\* so good on you!\", then beware. If you're pretty they will tell you that you're pretty, not that you look so.\n\nLast summer I was with some friends in Prague. One looked at me with slight disgust and said, \"you are SOO white. don't you think you should tan a bit?\" My other friend agreed. Once I was in an elevator with my brother, I looked at our reflection and said, \"wow, I look homeless.\" He said, \"you should tan.\" My dad recommends me to tan as well, almost every week. But tanning ages the skin...\n\nAnother time, I was at my university cafeteria and the man that every day served us food asked me if I was feeling okay, if I was ill. And a different time, we had a French guest of ours come to a rally with us, he looked at me with concern and asked, \"are you tired?\" I was fine. The plus side to looking sick all the time is that when you're actually sick people think you're sicker than you are.\n\nI had been into skincare for about a year. My friends knew that I used many face creams and serums. I had researched quite a bit on it. Even a pharmacist once told my mom, after we had a conversation, that I knew what I was talking about! Then, after about a year and a half of learning and improving, I finally decide to also delve into makeup. I go to a Sephora store. A lady that worked there asked if I needed some help, and I said I did. She then scanned my face and asked me if I took care of my skin at all? I mustered, \"well...\", and before I could finish she said, \"Before getting into makeup you should take care of your skin. Wash it, use moisturizer... You can't just cover up your flaws with makeup, you have to deal with the root problem\". Fastforward a couple of months and I'm at a dermatologist's office. I tell her I'm there to try a chemical peel. She asks me if I take care of my skin at all? I lie. I say that I only wash it.\n\nA long time ago, I fell in love. I made a friend through the internet and we talked for months every single day. I had fun. He made YouTube videos. He flirted with me often, and said he liked my voice. At one point, I also posted a video. He told me he had watched it. I asked him what he thought, and he said I made some valid points. I told him I'd gotten a bad haircut that specific day, which was true. I never heard from him again. Many years before that, when I was about 14, I was also talking to a boy online. I met him through [ask.fm](http://ask.fm/) I think, and I had a small silly crush on him. We messaged on Skype. He told me to send him a picture of myself. I did, I thought I looked fine. He sent an emoji and that was the end of our conversations.\u00a0\n\nBack in highschool I played a main role in a student short film that we had to make as a group. We played every group's short films in front of the whole class. When an up-close shot of my face appeared on screen, people gasped and then laughed.\u00a0\n\nMany years ago, I met up with my best friend's brother for tennis, I think. We ended up walking through the city with another friend of ours. Both of them walked side by side, leaving me behind. I tried to catch up and the brother unconsciously kept cutting me off. He only looked at her and spoke to her the whole time. I still have the same best friend, so I see her brother from time to time. The other night, I was at my friend's house, I was very excited about something and I was talking to her really hyper. Her brother then came home, and after our hello's I told him what I was excited about and showed it to him on my phone. He didn't acknowledge me or the phone and just said \"mhmm\" while making himself a sandwich. So I just stood there like a fool, phone in hand, showing him the screen. I went to sit down.\n\nThere are more stories about my face, but Reaper's at the door.", "subreddit": "ForeverAlone"}

I have a couple friends but they all live about 3 hours away since I moved away for college and the only person I know and talk to up here is my brother/roommate. I still talk to my friends back home almost everyday but it's just not the same as having someone here. I haven't found any friends up here; I tried during school but nothing stuck. Haven't found any groups or clubs that fit my tastes, haven't found anybody I'm interested in romantically. So I feel lonely but I still have some people. To be honest the thing I miss most from back home is having a partner. Not even for sex; just having that emotional connection with someone is all I want. Hell I haven't had sex in about 2 years (21 year old male), I just get bouts of super low libido; like I went 8 months without masturbating and sex because I was never in the mood and just felt like shit. Sex is nice but I really would rather just have someone to cuddle with, hold hands, and just have someone to fucking talk to. I could do with the friends being 3 hours away like it is now if I had a girlfriend.\n\nI've tried dating apps, I've tried in school, I've tried at groups/clubs, I've tried bars and nothing. Kind of just wanted to get this off my chest because it's been bugging me for a little while now and reddit is usually where I go to get stuff off my chest. All my friends have their partners, hell I just went to one of their weddings, and I'm happy for all of them but it's a constant reminder of how lonely I've been and it wears down on me.\n\nDon't know how I forgot about this but I feel like the last \"relationship\" I was in definitely hinders me right now finding someone else. I say \"relationship\" but we were never bf/gf but we talked everyday, said I love you, cuddled, sent good morning texts, everything a bf/gf would do except sex. But the shittiest part about it was when she ghosted me for 6 months for literally no reason and then the last time I saw her she said she never saw me as anything more than a friend and basically renounced and took back all that we did together and the \"love\" she felt for me.

I can only go by what Tinder in the US is but here it's a hookup site where looks are 99.9999999% of how people meet each other. Sure, people can hook up and then have a longer term relationship but I think it's humorous when people criticize a FA'ers Tinder profile. I'm not a fan of catfishing on Tinder but the results show how little personality means on there. People have wrote in their profiles how they are horrible people but if they are physically attractive, they will still get matches. People just want to hook up on there. With hookups looks are even more important than they already are outside of Tinder. \n\nI know some FA'ers have gone on Tinder dates and that is a good sign with their looks. Even if they get rejected, just getting a Tinder date means you probably aren't unattractive. I joined for a few weeks and got zero matches outside of bots. Actually I got a couple of matches who unmatched when I said hi. I knew I didn't have a chance but this was right before I completely gave up trying to escape FA. Unlike some other guys I don't blame women for being shallow and picky. Yes, women do have a large advantage on Tinder, but not all women. It's nobody's fault that society is becoming more like Tinder with relationships. I do blame social media for making it worse. Social media hates FA guys so as a FA guy, I hate it back. If I want to be called an evil nice guy incel who takes various colored pills, I would join a social media site and vent about being FA. \n\nTinder is part of the reason why you see articles like the one with the graph showing the number of guys 18-30 who aren't sexually active has tripled in the last 10 years. People get instant gratification by being able to swipe right or left. If someone wants casual sex, they don't even have to go out anymore. \n\nTinder gets men and women to see the worst in each other. That mentality carries over into dating overall. If Tinder didn't exist I would still be FA but I have to wonder how many FA'ers would have a chance without Tinder.", "subreddit": "ForeverAlone"}

But I think it's a classic and resonant with so many people because it respected it's main character and I feel the ending was perfect because it was decision and not an obligation and it with someone he actually cared for and he not only earned the respect of his peers he learned to respect himself a little more than he did before and he actually did have a lot of self respect.

Having gone through practically all my life without being able to make that connection with anyone, it's left me incomplete. Hollow.

How the hell could anyone begin to convince me that I'm not worthless and undesirable when that's all I've been shown to be at every turn? And the worst part? There's nothing anyone can do to fix it. No amount of effort can erase the pain and emotional distance. The damage is done. I'll never think of myself as worthy. I'll never be loved. I don't even know if I can love myself. I can't trust anyone. Not when they have a literal world of better options available-- people who can just live life, not caring of what can go wrong. I'm pathetic. So I'm resigned to eternal isolation, wishing I hadn't even been born. Every day, another notch of grief and regret to add to the load.

I\u2019ve been in some of the most remote locations in the world, no one in sight, and sure I\u2019ve thought about what it would be like with another person to share that moment with, but at the time I felt completely whole, on my own. This time was different though. I was across the world from home for three weeks, not particularly long for me, and for the first time since I was a child, I felt lonely. Really lonely. I haven\u2019t been able to shake the feeling since coming home. I have the overwhelming feeling that something in me, that\u2019s been held back or hidden for a long time is now free, awake, and hungry. Starving for attention, starving to be whole. Perhaps I never truly have been whole because I\u2019ve kept this feeling locked away. It\u2019s awake because, when I was away, I realized that I was lonely because I wasn\u2019t wondering what it would be like to be with someone through my experiences. I wanted to be with a certain someone. I had let someone into my life, to seed and root, and now without them sharing the experience with me, it felt empty and I felt alone.

And now that\u2019s where I find myself. I\u2019ve let someone in to the point of seeing a future and without them, without the confidence in that future, I feel desperate and in despair. Without that future to hold onto, I\u2019m lost. And it seems that nothing they do is enough to quell that feeling. I even fear that the feeling is pushing them away, which then self fulfills the prophecy of a painful end, alone again. And then one little text, or phone call, or facebook like from him - and it\u2019s all gone. All the fear, pain, dread. The spiral stops. \n\nHow do you get back to whole on your own?

I've been dating the same woman since November 10th, 2012. I've raised a child since April of 2013 (her daughter came w/ the territory). Honestly, I know I can be doing better. I have switched my schedule on multiple occasions to accommodate my partner's life, taken up financial responsibilities that do not concern me, reconnected w/ my family while becoming more acquainted w/ hers... yet we barely have a moment where I am not entirely \"happy.\"\n\nI have some college education, I am attracted yo other women, and I don't desire kids of my own (Seriously, if anything has brought any joy to me, it has been raising this little ratscallion. Nothing but joy!). I don't love the woman I am with any longer because of her lack in desire to better herself, all the bullshit she has attributed to my personal debt, and the lack of an intimate relationship. \n\nIf I were to cut the cord now, I would be working everyday not because I need to, but because I want to. I would be in the black before the end of the year; I would be in a better profession because I wouldn't have to worry about the cost of a certification program or putting money up front for school. But what for? NOTHING!!! The fucking purpose for doing all of this, bettering myself, is all for HER DAUGHTER!!!\n\nI grew up in a broken home. My mother had a poor taste in men, including my own father. As much of bastards he and my stepfather were, I made a decision many years ago that I would do my damned best to raise a child far better than any of them could. Call it Daddy Issues, but I knew what it was like to crave that guidance and wisdom a father could instill. As well, I'm so attached to this kid; I love her as though she were my own flesh and blood. \n\nSo there it is folks! While my partner and daughter sleep, I sit alone at a kitchen table unhappy, stressed, and wondering how to solve this quandary called life. Am I selfish? Maybe but who isn't?

At my last job, some of my coworkers would all flock to the \"cool\" coworkers while trying to avoid the \"uncool\" coworkers like myself.

Dude literally said \"I don't like them.\" The issue with me is that I'm fully aware that my former coworkers were jerks and tried too hard to impress management both in a \"I'm good at my job\" way and a \"Let's hang out outside of work\" type of way but I'm upset that people looked at me like \"who cares about her\" type of way and \"she doesn't count as a team member\" type of way.

But you know what I'm thinking about now? I've worked there longer than most people last. I worked there for a whole 9 months. And people at my job like to bring up former coworkers and laugh about them. I already know that my former manager who started three weeks before i did, who everyone flocks to is going to be like \"She sucked and she smelled really bad. Horrible breath. She was so dumb. Like sorry but...damn. And she had the ugliest face I've ever seen. Boogers all in her nose. Acne all over her face. It's like...do you shower?\" He's going to say something like that and everyone is going to agree. But why do I care anymore if I'm not working there? How do I stop caring so much?

Basically I am going through a whole lot at the moment like everyone I don't want to seem like I am looking for attention I just have absolutely nobody to speak to or who would care enough to listen. \n\nOk I don't know where to begin pretty much I come from a 3rd world country my father was a drug addict fool who was lost in the street life from a young age as all of his brothers are being 4 brothers and 8 girl siblings yeah a real big family of 14. I come from a 2 sibling family with enough trouble as it is so I can only begin to comprehend what he lived through as well for what I have at least come to know about thanks to my mother and my fathers long arguments that usually ended up with violence and the cops being called. It wasn't regulat violence my earliest memory of the first incidents involved him chasing me my older sister and mother down with a butcher knife which he proceeded to chuck at my mother and miss by a hair and hit a tree next to her head, another involved him kidnapping me and my sister and another time at a large party he started a fight between a man he believed to have been having adultery with my mother I remember it very vividly because my mother fainted at the hostess house all these incidents are very few to the many that later came but these are to mention the ones that happened in my early memories from 3-6 years old. I come from a long line of pedophiles and degenerates basically all I heard growing up during some of the arguments between my parents was about my dads childhood abuse how he was molested by his father same as the rest of his siblings many of my aunts will deny it because my grandfather has built pretty good wealth and the whole family just vultures over it and would rather keep their silence then bring themselves justice. My father would tell me many storys about how my grandfather would chain him down outside of the house to prevent him from runing away my father was a very troubled kid and there for acted out with vicious violence getting involved in street fights and gang brawls at partys. This is all pretty confirmed since he was kicked out by my grandfather when he was 16 at this point he had also been shot at plenty of times and actually hit once in the butt where he still has the bullet in to this day he also had about 4 or 6 of his original teeth left he had almost all of them kicked in by a guy in his neighborhood who had steel tow boots on so he was forced to illegally come to the US but besides all the trouble he was regularly in he had also gotten my mother pregnant at that time with my older brother who was miscarried 4 months into the pregnancy. Basically that is a short breef story on my father.  Now on to my mother she was also from a large family 7 siblings or 6 I believe from two different fathers it was her a younger brother and an older sister from the same father and then an older brother and two more sisters from another father who were both absent fathers throughout all of the childrens lifes so my grandmother her mother was left to fend off for them with what little she could. My mother comes from even more poverty then my father money is truly an evil thing when left in the wrong hands growing up my father would always repent that me and my sister were not his children but his siblings and that my father was really my grandfather I do not know if this is true and will probably never find out. I am an exact replica copy of my father but my mother looks alot like his mother my grandmother so I really don't know the answer just from comparison because it is very possible that he could've been telling the truth all this time. I do not know if my mother went through any sexual abuse like my father but mental and other type of physical abuse I am sure of. After my dad left to the US my mother mis carried and he went back for a short while went through alot of depression and eventually got my mother pregnant and had to come back to the US to do it all over again and send back money almost 3 years after my sister was born she was pregnant with me. 6 months later I was born small weak and too early. Growing up my mother would always take care of me and my sister making sure we dressed well and looked as nice as possible with what little we had which was not very much even with my dad sending money back my mother working one of my grandfathers corner stores all by herslef and heling out with one of his familys food side business we still struggled often to make ends needs and had to call my father at many of times to remind him to send money. Growing up me and my sister were always complimented on our looks we were pretty good looking children and even growing up all my friends always seemed to fall for my sister and tell me that they had a crush on her for me well many of my sisters friends would always like me but I honestly became very oblivious to it and never saw myself as an attractive person much of it has to do with what later happened to me growing up. I don't want to drag this on for too long so I am going to jump straight to the point and the reason why I am struggling today and will probably die this way. My mother and sister both deny this ever happening both say that I've made the wholde thing up in my head and dreamt it all. Basically I have very vivid memories of being sexually abused in kindergarten going home having trouble while peeing and therefore having to tell my mom who got the police involved and the culprits fired being my kindergarten female teacher and the male principal. I have so many vivid memories of it all. The many days my mom took me and my sister to the district offices and filed a lawsuit and the many days we had to go back to said building to keep pursuing the lawsuit. I remember this specifically because vendors outside on the street would be selling merchandise like toys watches high end stuff for the country I remember always looking at a light up spiderman watch and beging my mom to buy it for me every time we went to the offices until the final and last day we had to go that's when she bought it for me which I assume is the day that we were payed for the lawsuit at this point i was already unrecognizable to myself when the abuse happened I was abusing food and I didn't want to take care of myself in appearance and hygiene I stopped brushing my teeth refused to bathe I noticed not doing these things kept people away from me. The kindergarten eventually closed down and I remember standing outside the gate looking into the main entrance pateo with the small concrete kittie pool in the center area that would be used during the summer heat. I was in elementary up to the 2nd grade I was 6 years old when my mother decided to bring us to the US to re unite with my father. Before this I was hospitalized for almost a whole year do to kidney problems I had kidney stones and was peeing blood I remember the night that it happened and exactly what we had for dinner and the movie we were watching my father was also back visiting since we had all that money by the time I was hospitalized he was gone and back in the US. When coming to the US yes we did it illegally and failed the first time so I approximate that we spent close to 30 thousand in all since we failed thr first time. I have spoken to my father recently and confronted him about it all he denies it as well same as my sister and mother but says other wise about where all the money came from he claims he earned it all working here and saving and sending it back. While my mom claims she earned it working for my grandfather and also saving what my father would send. But this is where I know those are all lies because he wasn't capable of even supporting himself here in the US and even less support another 3 people it wasnt long after we arrived that he couldn't afford to pay the rent and made my mother work cleaning houses much and many other drama happened involving my uncle whos house we rented a single room at and lived in all four of us in one room all the way up until I was in middle school. Basically he got my sister pregnant and had been having a relationship with her since I was in elementary school I had known about it and had told my mom about it long before the tipping point ever came. I saw alot I haven't even mentioed and personally I know how troubled and mentally unstable everyone around me was and some still are I have no one to talk to about it or anyone who will listen. I am slowly loosing my own sanity or what little I have been able to hold onto in this life. My mother sister and I were granted residency because of what my father did and I wish I could say everything was well afterwards but it has been far from that. From all the self applied I don't know what to even call it harm, pain, pretty much I struggled with my weight was around 245 at 5'8 in height at the age of 16 and have come close to having heart complications. All the self neglectment I did in order to push people away eventually came back to bite me never carrying for my dental state was been with me since I was 5 but now bothers me to the point I cant ride the bus to work without getting into a confrontation over stinking up the bus I don't even have to talk to affect the people around me. I can't be in a closed room or car do to this and pretty much I am left to work jobs that nobody wants where I have little to no contact or communication with other people I did graduate high school. Never pursued my academic goals do to this issue never felt comfortable anywhere I went. I did eventually loose weight and gained my health back thanks to a few friends that took me under their wing I went from the 245 to 145lbs and fell in love with weight lifting and being physically active but I could never try to get a carrier working with people doing fitnes do to what I have done to myself. Now I work a job that even ex felons with tattoos in their face wont work for longer then a day or two which I wish was just a made up analogy but it actually happens almost every other week at my job. I am the only worker that isn't related to the company owner and that hasn't quit after a few days. I will most likely die alone keeping all of this and much more to myself. I really havent felt like myself in such a long time I've lost all sense in who I was. Going day by day without any type of human communication or at least one that won't call me a lier and crazy. The first time I ever confronted my mother about my past she denied it all said I was crazy I never mentioned any money just that I remembered it all the abuse when and how it happened the night terrors no longer being able to share the same bed as my sister when we were young because I would scratch her face in my sleep and wake up screaming at night. But all she would mention is I dont have your money I had never mentioned any money that just gave it all away that I wasn't crazy that I didn't make it all up in my head. They did try to make me go to therapy back when it happened after the lawsuit was passed but my mother stopped taking me once I began having night terrors I have vivid memories of sitting at the therapist office with her and them fighting about me going and my mother saying she can't deal with the long nights anymore. At the end everyone enjoyed the money my mother bought her high end clothes, gucci boots paid off alot of things I got all the food I asked for to eat my feelings away and my dad got his nice truck my sister got a few nice things and eventually after another argument with my mom my sister got all the money that was left from it 10k which is in a bank account in Mexico I never cared about the money I didn't even know about the money all I was looking for was my sanity. I don't know how much longer I can see meaning in this life I gave it all I had for as long as I could and I am contempt with leaving with just that.", "subreddit": "lonely"}

I use the term lonely vaguely because I\u2019m not \u201clonely\u201d in the physical sense. I have family all around me that wishes to support me, and a friend back in my hometown. But mentally I feel isolated. Anyway, i have had some glimmers of hope for my future recently. Friend of a friend told me I wasn\u2019t completely ugly. I\u2019ll take it. Family says I\u2019ve lost weight even though I\u2019m pretty sure I\u2019ve stayed the same. I\u2019ll take it. I was finally able to give my family an answer to the \u201cWhat do you want to do\u201d question. I\u2019ll take it. Now I just have to work off of the motivation I\u2019ve been given and improve myself even more. // I\u2019ve noticed something... my online persona is a complete 180 of myself. I present myself as a female in most if not all video games that allow me to do so. I don\u2019t catfish or anything, i just like using the opportunity to not be me for a while. This has recently caused some trouble though and I\u2019m still not sure how to handle it. I met some players on a game i like and they know me as the female that doesn\u2019t talk (for obvious reasons). Well now they wish to get to know me better and make me a part of their staff team on the server they run in the game, which I would love to do. If I told them the truth I obviously wouldn\u2019t be trusted to be staff, and if I leave them in the dark they will never know me any better than this persona that can only go so far. So yea... 17m here btw, forgot to mention that. // Relationships! Aren\u2019t those fun? I wouldn\u2019t know. Senior year in high school and the only one I\u2019ve had ended as quickly as it started. I have a huge crush on a cheerleader. Rip. Time to play a game of \u201cHow long will it take to move on from this girl that has no interest in you whatsoever??\u201d Love that one. Goin on 2 years, i might beat some records. If you want more details and backstory on me and this girl read \u201cInteresting title #2\u201d (maybe #3?). I feel like I\u2019m trying way too hard to get a girl. Anyone got some hobbies I can distract myself with? Any advice to avoid future headaches? // Anyone here a fan of Ratchet and Clank, Burnout 3, My Babysitters a Vampire, Soeedcubing, Legend of the Guardians, the Legend book series, or SAO? Oh speaking of which I am one cheesy mf when it comes to romance shit because I love animes like SAO, Toradora, Angel Beats, etc. They really hit home with what I\u2019d look for in a relationship... you know, without all the trapped in game worlds, afterlives, and shitty situations stuff.", "subreddit": "lonely"}

I do believe that to be true. The more you have, the more there is to lose. \u201cDon\u2019t be the person you think people want you to be, be the person that allows others to be who they want to be.\u201d Quoted from Michael Steven\u2019s (Vsauce) Ted talk. I was really trying to think of ways to be more social at the time and this quote really caught my eye. I do believe it to be true but if you try to apply it consciously it won\u2019t turn out the way you want it to. \u201cWhen we find a problem, we never look back and say \u201cOne chance, one moment, it\u2019s gone so easily...\u201d\u201d This is from Here I am by The Explosion. This line in their song hit me hard in the feels reminding me of all my regrets in my life so far. \u201cIf you spend too much time trying to prove to someone that you\u2019re trustworthy, you may forget that they have to prove they\u2019re trustworthy as well.\u201d This is one I came up with, and I feel I could word it better, but it gets the point across. \u201cA life not lived is not a life worth living.\u201d Came up with that after reading Into the Wild and relating with Chris. \u201cSometimes the little things start closing in on me. When I\u2019m feeling down, I wanna lose that frown. I stick my head out the window and I look around. Those clouds don\u2019t scare me, they can\u2019t disguise this magic that\u2019s happening right before my eyes.\u201d Tried to cheer myself up with this line from the Spongebob song Best Day Ever. \u201cYour dark defines your light.\u201d From Chronic Future\u2019s Time and Time Again. Showing one side of yourself generally defines everything about you to someone. \u201cHindsight is co-standard with rose colored lenses.\u201d Kind of modified quote from a song. 10 points if you guess the song. At least in my version of that line it\u2019s saying that you always look at your past as being \u2018the good times\u2019. \u201cWe\u2019re all tied talk when push comes to shove.\u201d Another modified quote, another 10 points if you can guess the song. In my version it\u2019s saying that when things start getting out of control being verbal won\u2019t get you anywhere. \u201cThere are only two tragedies in life: one is not getting what one wants, and the other is getting it\u201d I do believe I got this from a thread here on Reddit.

{"post_id": "c1ahnb", "created_utc": 1560695413, "title": "Tips Tricks &amp; Wisdom For Overcoming Loneliness: From A 5 Year Traveller On The Self Improvement Journey", "author": "Bobbyschuette", "self_text": "Hi everyone!\n\nI'm new to the sub, I hope you're all having a great day. I'm 34 and have experienced loneliness all my life. I understand how you all feel. I drew a line when I turned 30 and have been fighting to turn my life around ever since. I am in a down period right now (life goes up and down, never coasts straight it seems!), and I recently discovered reddit so I thought \"why not see if there is a loneliness community on here.\" There is, that's awesome. \n\nHowever what immediately struck me is how many people are hurting and seeking answers on here. I've learned a lot in the 5 years I've been fighting this battle so before I go and post about my own problems I thought I would offer some imsight and solutions for you all that have worked for me, and hopefully can work for you too. \n\n1) The pain you are experiencing is real. \"My heart is broken\". \"There is a hole in my chest\".  This is called emotional pain. Your brain is registering pain, even though you have no physical injury. \n\nPain is nature's way of teaching us to avoid things that can harm or kill us. As a child you learn quickly through pain that a hot stove will burn you, falling from tall heights will hurt you, certain snakes and spiders can poison you, etc. \n\nLoneliness is not good for you. The pain is your body telling you that something is wrong and you need to fix it.\n\n2) Loneliness is a condition of our time. Modern humans are social mammals, living in a time when our technology has caused us to become extremely isolated from one another. \n\nFor tens of thousands of years humans lived in hunter gatherer tribes and survived by forming strong family and social bonds. Everyone knew everyone. The strength of the tribe would have relied on everyone supporting eachother.\n\nNow we live in mega-cities. We are anonymous. We have no tribe support network. It is far too easy to get lost and disconnected. Never before have humans been so surrounded by other people, but alone. We crave human connection and turn to our phones and social media to satisfy the craving. This does not work.\n\n4) Emotional pain leads to addiction. You will find some things provide relief from pain in the moment. They allow you to escape or feel good. Video games, tv, porn, overeating, alcohol, drugs. Social media is particularly addicting because every time someone likes or comments on your stuff, you get a shot of dopamine in your brain. Dopamine makes you feel good. Have you ever found yourself checking your phone every 30 seconds, or endlessly scrolling through instagram? You are searching for connection and dopamine. These things provide short term relief, but reliance on them causes long term damage. \n\n3) What Can You Do?\n\nTo immediately get relief from emotional pain, try turning on loud music and screaming into a pillow. \n\nThe long term solution is to meet the conditions necessary for a human being to be happy. You have physical needs that we all are familiar with - food, water, shelter, etc. But beyond that you have emotional needs. \n\nThere is a ton of literature out there on this topic. The model I like is from a book called \"Feel the Fear and Do It Anyway\". It is the 9 bucket model.\n\nThink of your life as being a series of 9 buckets. They are titled:\n\nContribution (giving back to the world)\nHobbies\nLeisure\nFamily\nAlone Time\nPersonal Growth\nWork\nRelationship\nFriends\n\nThe key to happiness is having your buckets full and balanced. \n\nTry this exercise. Write out these buckets and a piece of paper, and fill in how much things you have in your life right now filling them.\n\nFor most of us on here, you will probably have noticed that \"relationship\" and \"friends\" are empty, while \"work\" is extremely full. This is where your emotional pain comes from. Your brain is telling you that something is out of wack, and you need to fix it. \n\n4) Improving self esteem\n\nLow self esteem is usually developed in child hood, and will invisibly guide you down a path of loneliness for as long as you let it. \n\nIt is a vicious cycle. For example, you are embarassed to go to the gym because you are too fat and afraid people will judge you. So you don't go. This makes you gain more weight. Now you feel worse and have lower self esteem. So you are even less likely to go to the gym.\n\nImproving your self esteem is step one towards overcoming loneliness. Again there is a ton of literature out there. But after reading a bunch of it, here is what stuck with me:\n\nYou have an internal \"critic\" in your head. This is the voice that says \"you are too fat, people will judge you if you go to the gym. Stay home and eat a bag of chips instead\". It is the negative self talk we tell ourselves. Now here is the problem. In a weird way, the critic is helping you. You feel afraid when you think of going to the gym, so the critic steps in and makes you stay home. You feel relieved. Your brain registers this as a good thing. You avoided the danger. Now this behaviour gets reinforced and the critic attacks you the next time you think of going to the gym.\n\nYou have to break this cycle and tell your critic to stop. Its weird but you can actually train it to support and motivate you. Start by writing down everything your critic says as soon as you wake up. Do this for a whole day. You will be surprised at all of the negative talk running through your head. Write it down and then analyze it. Tell the critic \"no, I will not be judged at the gym. Instead I may find people who support me and help me there.\" Turn every negative into a positive. And soon the critic will be saying \"hey lets go to the gym.\"\n\nI hope this helps some of you! I wrote it quickly om my way to work. Looking forward to discussing and connecting with some of you! \n\nFill those buckets!", "subreddit": "lonely"}

Maybe is because I'm still twelve and act childishly sometimes. What can I say? I was never exposed to a friend for the first nine years of my life, never socialized, never really knew how to talk around people. I was awkward around both boys and girls, I used to cry a lot.\n\nI don't know.\n\nI had a guy friend once (few months ago), found out he liked me, freaked because of the fact that he would creep me out on social media, follow everyone in my family, making our conversations unnecessarily long, etc. I didn't want a relationship, (fucking hell, I am twelve) plus I alrd had a crush which never noticed me.\n\n Maybe I'm just being over dramatic or just excessively paranoid.\n\nAt home, I feel lonely. Most of the time, my little brother is just making noise, or my mom is cleaning the house. Not to mention, I spend around nine hours doing my homework, leaving no time to do anything else.\n\nA few years ago, I had this really weird thing going in on inside my head. It was like someone was screaming, and screaming. I couldn't stop it, I was so scared. I never told my parents. A year passed and it stopped. Now, I just feel sad, and I drown my worries in music. Sometimes it works. Sometimes it doesn't.\n\nI hate that I'm so weak. My friends around me, they say they have depression, a dozen various mental problems, cramps all the time, headaches, but they don't act like they actually have something wrong going on.\n\nI realize I hardly laugh anymore, fuck it, I never laugh. I just stay quiet and I don't really have the energy to do simple things like nod my head or get out of a chair. I'm not fat, I have a great body shape, an okay face, but it seems like that doesn't matter to my friends. They don't care if someone doesn't loo great or whatever. I don't know why they leave me out so much. Its definitely not my facial features, I haven't figured out yet.\n\nI used to laugh a lot. I used to be more kind, more friendly. I used to have that happy aura around me. But my friends have drained me completely. Suicide thoughts cross my mind sometimes, but I don't care about dying. I don't want to die, but I don't want to live. You know the feeling like you wished you never existed? I feel that way. I have no purpose in life, I'm a dead weight, literally.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThanks for listening to my rant. I hope one day I'll feel better.", "subreddit": "lonely"}

I managed to starve myself to an unhealthy weight, to isolate myself from everyone and to gain such hatred for my body that till this day I cannot shake off. Somehow I understood that I was literally slowly killing myself and decided to recover but instead of that I started to binge. And believe me, I binged HARD. I gained a healthy amount of weight and since I went to a mental hospital for that I stopped binging for a while but I didn't become social and I isolated myself because I think I look disgusting. Now, for a half year I just feel so lonely, so lost.\n\nI have (had?) a best friend who now has her own life, many friends and I don't have a place in it, even when I got hit by a car, she never asked how I was feeling, never visited me. I am the one to initiate conversations unless she needs help somewhere. My ex, who also had(has) problems with eating, now has a perfect boyfriend and amazing grades. And now I'm left alone with couple of video games (Diablo 3 is a savior tbh) and the food. Food has become a comfort for me. Since I feel a hole inside my chest, since no one(except for my family, god bless them) care about me too much, it seems like I fill it with food and at least at that moment I feel great, but the weight is getting higher and higher and the anorexic side in me is just screaming at me at full force to just stop fucking eating and get a grip of myself and just starve.\n\nI began to volunteer in a food bank (sadly the car that hit me stopped it but in few days I'll go there again), I tried to talk with people but it seems like at the end of the day I'm left alone, that I'm just a background character in everyone's lives. I hate this feeling. No matter how hard I try to make new bonds, no matter how much I want to be confident in myself and enjoy the life as it is, everything seems hopeless. I hate the fact that I use food as a comfort but it seems like it's the only thing in my life that will never leave me, even though everyday I hate myself more and more for eating.\n\nIf anyone is reading this, I hope you will find your person, I hope that something in your life will spark a little fire in your heart and for god's sake, I hope you will never use food/alcohol/drugs as a replacement for people. And if you do, please get professional help. It works if you are determined to change your life.\n\nEdit: Thank you for giving me a platform to let my feelings out", "subreddit": "lonely"}

I could totally have just written this all in a Word document but quite frankly I haven't had any human interaction in a while \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAugust 2016 - I move to Spain to study abroad for a year. Everything's going great, making loads of cool new friends and having a pretty good social life. I've always been a weed smoker but it was just easier to get over there so a once-in-a-while habit turned into a can't-live-without-it kind of thing. I'd literally stay in my room from whatever time I woke up until whatever time I fell back asleep just smoking. I think I just liked how it made me feel like.. not a person. Anyway as you can probably guess this fucked me up mentally. This destructive behaviour culminated in me getting a bad case of food poisoning and ending up in the hospital. In Spain. Alone. Attempted suicide. Next day, I called my mum and told her everything, and she flew out to come and get me. What a legend. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMarch 2017 - Back home, lowest point of my life. Crying every day for no reason, completely isolating myself. Sometimes I'd be completely catatonic. Like, I could hear my mum's voice but something in my head told me not to move or make a sound. Kind of scary actually. After a few months of medication I finally start feeling better. Decide to get a job at a local bar. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAugust 2017 - Life is finally getting back on track! You know why? Because I have my first ever boyfriend! He's funny and... actually, he was just funny. I didn't see it like that at the time but hindsight is 20/20 I guess. As the human brain is wont to do, I start convincing myself that this boyfriend is the reason I got better. Of course he was! It totally wasn't my already-fucked-up-brain making arbitrary associations! Obviously! Anyway, I was getting better and it was (apparently) all because of him. I convinced myself that what we had was love. Yeah, he'd make me have sex when I didn't want to, and yeah, he'd belittle me and make nasty jokes about my body to our coworkers, but he said that was love and who was I to argue?! \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSeptember 2017 - He raped me. He then told everyone we worked with that I'd made up a story about him raping me and not to believe it. He also told everyone about the suicide attempt. Who would believe the crazy girl, right?! I quit.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNovember 2017 - Finishing my last year of University. 10th best University in the world. Not a brag, just a lot of fucking pressure. I stop talking to friends. Even when they reached out to me, I couldn't bring myself to reply. They all eventually drop off the radar. My fault. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSeptember 2018 - At least I graduated, right?! Not a terrible GPA, not a great one. But I did it! I have a degree! Now what?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nJune 2019 - I've been unemployed since September. I've got a great degree, but no friends, no job and no money. I live at home with my parents and my cat. I don't talk to anyone. I stay in bed all day and watch youtube videos. I'm trying to come to terms with all of this but I honestly don't know how. I can't even get an entry level admin job because I have no experience. I speak four languages and have an IQ of 129. What the fuck is the point of all of that if I can't afford to do an unpaid internship? You need experience to get a job but you need to get a job to get experience.

{"post_id": "c20gqa", "created_utc": 1560852815, "title": "I am a Man", "author": "GoldenRod774", "self_text": "People forget that. People forget that I am a human, a living, breathing, thinking member of Mankind. I think people forget it, not because they're ignorant, or because they're malicious, but because it's in our nature to assign qualities to things, and sometimes those qualities can take precedence over other ones. You look at someone and go \"oh yeah, that's a person. That is a human\" but, as we get over the initial reaction we assign other attributes to them. Are they tall, short? Fat, thin? Lanky, lean, ripped, buff? Do they have scars, deformities? Are they in a wheelchair, do they have prosthetic limbs, wacky clothes, intentionally ostentatious outfits or hair colours? Are they eating, if so how. Are they smiling, laughing, talking? Are they sullen, sour, are they in a group, by themselves, are they sad, weathered, old, young? Are they wearing identifiable marks, brands, political affiliations, are they protesting something? Are they broadcasting their ideologies?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe look at a person and we see these things, and suddenly this person, this living, breathing, thinking person with emotions, and a complex life is reduced to a handful of attributes that we then filter through our biases to decide if they're worth consideration. Worth their right to exist in our headspace. We perceive them, but then we decide if they're *worth* perceiving. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEveryone forgets that I am a Man, and everyone forgets in their own way. Let me explain, for the maybe four of you that are still reading. To the neighbours, I am the **creepy shut in**. Not a man, just two attributes; **Creepy,** and **Shut-In.** Now, *because* I am a **Creepy Shut-In,** that means I don't have the right to merit consideration. They see me in my yard, in my window, they see me out and about and they give me these *looks* that say \"you are not like me, therefore I do not like you.\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTo my mother, I am a **Disappointment.** I am the child who didn't make it, the bird that couldn't fly from the nest. The **Leech** of the family. The **Layabout.** The **Worthless C\\*unt.** Twenty four years of being her child reduced to four attributes. I cease to be a Man, and become the **Disappointing, Worthless, Layabout, Leech.** So now, whenever she comes home from work, she sees me having not moved much, still lying in bed, sleeping, pottering about online, and she gets angry at that. It's unfair to her, why should I get this, in her mind's eye, *easier* life? Anger turns to distance, distance turns to resentment, I cease to be her son and instead become just another source of annoyance and pain.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTo the political left, I am a **Fascist Nazi** for my views. To the political right, I am a **Morally Bankrupt** **Leftard.** To the centrists I am guilty of the sin of being an **Apathetic.** To my sister I am a **Virgin Failure.** To my teachers I was the **Annoyance.** To my friends I was the **Sperg.** To strangers I am the **Fat, Ugly, Loser.** To my doctor I am the **Depressed.** I am nothing but a *MAN*. And just for once I would like someone to remember that before judging, and assigning these meaningless words just so that I fit in with their view of the world.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEveryone assigns these attributes to me, and do you notice that they are all negative? Enough people assigning negative attributes to someone, eventually they'll start believing it. Eventually they'll assign those attributes to *themselves,* too. And that's the true evil of this; sometimes I forget I am a man, too. A human being, with thoughts and failings, flaws and desires. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLife is all about finding people to assign some positive attributes to you. Like, take a well-adjusted normal person. To his parents, he's a source of pride. He's a **Success.** To his friends, he's a **Comedian.** To his teachers he was **Bright, Intelligent,** and **Gifted.** To his significant other, he was the **World.**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nUnfortunately we don't have anyone to give us those labels.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe most I have is one friend in America and my Cat. To my cat, maybe I'm a **source of food** and **warmth.** Maybe to my cat I am the **world.** To my friend, I'm a **kindred spirit.** I'm a **brother.** \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBut, those positive reinforcements don't outweigh all the constant negative ones shoved in my face. We're just stuck with the shit the people around us give us anyway. And the second we feel like that isn't fair, they shovel *more* shit on us. \"Find someone who will think of you positively.\" Or \"surround yourself with people who like you.\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBut how are we meant to, when everyone around us has already made up their minds, and *forgotten* that we are *human beings?*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe exact *second* we make our displeasure known, and say that their advice does nothing for us, we do nothing but reinforce all those attributes, no matter what we do. ***We cannot change a mind that is already made up about who and what we are.*** \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo there's no point to even try.", "subreddit": "ForeverAlone"}

You could consider me a \"shut-in\", except that I can leave my house. Started work 2 years ago. Moving through different temporary positions. I'm on my 3rd one now. Monetarily I think I'm fine for the foreseeable future.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThings at work are okay. I think I do my job well enough. It is people that I always have trouble with, and by trouble, I don't mean it like I don't get on with them. I think I just seem so uninteresting that it wouldn't be worth the effort talking to me. I would and I do try to engage with others but what is there to talk about when there is no common ground? No shared experiences, things to relate with, apart from vapid things like shows, or video-games, which I do enjoy talking about, I just don't want it to be the only thing I can talk about, y'know? Years of social isolation really doesn't help in gaining talking points, or experience. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhat's more is that my colleagues primarily speak a another language. I live in a \"multi-cultural\" city and while being a part of the \"majority race\", I do not speak the mother tongue. It's an issue here being monolingual. I think I have a pretty unique perspective regarding that. Constant feeling of unbelonging. Having no tribe.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt really does me no favors that I am a quiet person. (i guess no shit at this point..) I get called \"quiet\" all the time. It saddens me that it's the first impression I make on people, even in the times that I do try. The irony is that I could probably talk about \"real shit\" for days.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnyway, I will be 23 this year and I don't want the rest of my life to go to waste. I am tired of using dissociation as a coping mechanism for work. I want to save myself. I feel like trying. All I could ever wish for is people I can connect to, and vice versa. Just someone. It could be anyone. If you managed to make it through my wall of text, thank you so much for reading. It really means a lot to me. :) Drop me a PM if you want.", "subreddit": "lonely"}

The cheating, emotional abuse, ghosting, and gaslighting is more isolating than just isolating myself from my peers and spending time with my admitedly toxic parents who I still care about. \n\nEven though my mom was abusive, I blame her mental illness and refusal to get better mental help, and the latter is her fault, but I guess I still  prefer the devil I know to the devil I don't. She's mostly under control, save for the occasional episode, but I at least know that she's too old and weak now to physically overpower me, something that I can't say about potential future romantic partners.\n\nPfft, potential future romantic partners, for a morbidly obese, ugly, severely mentally ill highschool dropout like me? Do those still exist? Did they ever exist? Can I actually find a virgin like me willing to wait until our wedding night, but who also isn't religious or judgmental towards those who choose not to wait? I'm fine with people doing their own thing, I just wish that the few fellow straight edge squares I've met weren't so toxic in other ways.\n\nNon virgins are fine people, please don't think I hate them just because I don't want to date them. I just want to save that part of myself for someone else who also saves that part of themselves for our wedding night. Please don't suggest to me that I give non virgins a chance.\n\n \nI tried. It didn't feel right. Even if you ignore the cheating and emotional abuse, it just felt like a waste of time. Our values were so fundamentally different that I almost don't blame them for cheating on me, only I do blame them because cheaters are scum of the Earth, cowards, and liars. What's fucked up is for a second I felt like they deserved another chance. Thank goodness I didn't give them another chance to hurt me.\n\nProblem is, I don't want to be weak like that ever again. I don't want to be hurt that way again. I don't want to die alone, but I'd still rather die alone than feel so used and heartbroken again.\n\nI'm not some brave WGTOW all strong, independent, who don't need no man, as outdated, gramatically incorrect stereotypes would put it. I've never claimed to be. I'm just a coward, mortally afraid of  suffering at anyone's devices but my own.

Then a month later, my best friend moved away. Then, all of my friends at work quit the job I'm working at. Next 2 of my other best friends moved. I still have friends, but I cherish the close relationships to having many surface friendships.\n\nI used to spend all my time with my ex. We worked together when we met so we shared a lot of mutual friends. We then after work, would plan to do something for all of our time off, whether that be traveling, hiking, going out, seeing shows, or going to the beach. I spent so much time with him, that when the relationship ended I became so afraid of being alone again. It was a toxic relationship that nearly ruined my confidence so I don't feel ready or attractive enough to date right now even though I no longer have feelings for him.\n\nSo I went out with my girls a lot after we broke up, luckily at that time I still had a lot of girlfriends in the area to hang out with, but my closest ones moved away shortly after.\n\nOh, I forgot to mention that I moved to this town only a month prior to dating my ex, so I never got the chance to really expand myself and figure out how to be alone in this town. It's a small mountain town so it's very hard to meet people unless you know them already, people are very friendly but also very flakey and keep to themselves for the most part. It's also very transient, people come and go with the season and move frequently. The close friends I still have here are amazing and I love them a lot, but they have very different schedules than me so it's near impossible to see them. So I've been left spending all my days off alone. I've got back into working out which is great, but I feel this deep emptiness like a void that I can't seem to fill. I feel like my life has turned upside down. I went from having all of these amazing people in my life to having hardly anyone. I know it'll get better. It's hard for me to want to go out right now, in case I run into my ex or any of his friends since it's such a small town. The times I have gone out, I've ran into his friends who I like but I no longer want to have contact with because I can't bare to see him anymore. \n\nI've never felt so alone or so sad before. I'm having trouble coping with this. I recently just left my job too to pursue another place hoping I'll meet new people, but it is a small staff and they are mostly guys, one who is even a close friend of my ex. I know I just need to meet new people and get out there, but it's so hard and I am lacking the confidence and motivation to do so at the moment. It sucks, because its summer and most of the stuff to do here is outside and fun for groups of people, I can do things alone and I do, but I feel insecure when I see groups of people having fun when I'm all alone wishing I wasn't.\n\nIf you have any advice, I'd love to hear it thanks :)", "subreddit": "lonely"}

At first I had a lot of great friends that I had known for a while and really trusted and cared about and would do anything for. But just recently for no known reason to me pretty much all of them just stopped talking to me and began to avoid me and not want to be around me at all. So then when all of that was going on me and 4 other guys reconnected and became very close all of a sudden but we\u2019ve all known each other for a few years. The first few months of this new friend group were amazing. We hung out multiple times per week and just chilled with each other and had a blast and it made me super happy to have that closeness with a group of friends. But ever since my summer started about 2 weeks ago it has gone completely downhill. I know people say this a lot but I truly feel like the \u201cfriend\u201d in the group that no one really wants in it anymore but there\u2019s not really a way to like get rid of me in a way because of how established the group is. Every time we go to hang out or make plans it feels like whenever I\u2019m involved everyone gets bummed out and makes me feel like such a buzzkill. Actually just today I was talking with one of them that I\u2019m probably closest with(or at least I thought I was) and he straight up told me that whenever we are hanging out that I am a buzzkill to the group. And also recently it feels like I\u2019ve lost the closeness with them it seems like all of them have so much in common and they all have this connection with each other but they suddenly just left me out of all of that so I feel very disconnected from all of them and like I\u2019m not even a part of their friendship anymore. So yeah sorry if this seemed disorganized or didn\u2019t make sense I was just kinda typing out whatever came to mind and just wanted to say it somewhere and get it off my mind.

I do LSD every other weekend, smoke weed and take kratom every day, and I'm developing a xanax habit now too. Whenever I see my true sober side, I typically retreat back into drugs. I regret dropping out of college and spending my early 20s around burnout losers who played too many video games and only did drugs, because at 26 most people seem to be incredibly hard to relate to. People around me seem to devote too much of their identity around their careers and having fleeting \"experiences\", which they then use to create a meticulously crafted Instagram account that strategically shows how well-traveled and worldly they are, at least this is how I feel about people that live in major cities.

I realized this girl, I at least thought, I was close with no longer wanted anything to do with me and I had no clue why. We would do so many things together all the time. For months following this I'd just stay home after school and basically would lay in my room for hours until it was time for bed. It started driving me crazy. In late December/early January, I decided to get back into the gym (I had quit that August) so I'd have something to do. I also had been feeling self-conscious about my body because I'm skinny. Now after 6-7 months of consistently going, I'm finally starting to see results on my chest and arms!!!! Hopefully my body will look appealing to a girl if I ever get one.\n\nI usually only went to the gym three times a week so I needed something else to fill in the other two days. My school had been offering to take a free college class at the nearby community college after school twice a week. I decided I could use that as an opportunity to possibly make new friends so I signed up for the classes. While I didn't end up making any friends there, I had an excellent, passionate professor, learned something interesting (nutrition) and I earned three college credits at the end of the semester with a B-!!!\n\nThese past few weeks have been difficult, the person I cared for a lot left me. The THIRD time in my life and it really fucking hurt. It sucks when you barely give a shit about anything except for a few thing and that thing just ups and leaves you without a care. I'm about to graduate in a week and looking back, I feel like I went to the wrong HS and was robbed of my high school experience. I barely clicked with anyone at my school. And on top of that, now that Summer break has essentially begun, I'm about to feel even more lonely. Despite all of this, I've been actively look for things to do with myself these days because being home all day literally drives me crazy. Today I decided to go into the city and sign up for a youth recreation center that seems to have cool programs and opportunities to meet new people. Tomorrow I'm going to go check them out. Hopefully I finally meet new people and make real friends. \n\nAs much as I'm wallowing in my sorrows a little bit with this post, I think it's also a success story in a way.

I was wandering in those post here and was really sad to see how many people suffer from dificulties to develop a relationship or even connect to other people. Most of them are good persons and just don't understand what is wrong about them. Well...I can say that i already felt that way an it sucks. The worst part is when you can't even get any feedback about what are the mistakes. Im average person, not fit, not the smartest one nor the sportsman and most important, i don't have much money. I always saw nice guys saying 3 seconds of words in girls ears and then they suddendly kissed each other. I wondered what these guys say ? Is it about the way they say ? I though it was all about those questions. The problem that i went to know much time after was that the biggest of all mistakes was having neglected the importance of friendship and having a healthy social life. I looked after to reatain the laces of friendship i had and to try (even agains my will) to not avoid social events, because i realized that if i really want to get anybody then i need to be at places and to appear in front of people. As soon as i started doing these things my lack of oportunity became the source of success. I'm not good at giving advices because im not sure if it will fit the reallity of who read it but i want to say that the life is incredible and when you don't expect anything, this is when the things changes. Who says to not focus on having girlfriend or have patience do not know the weight of being alone, but i can assure one thing and i can prove: Most of people concerns is about being alone and they will do anything to not be like that. On the other hand, people here that was always lonely don't have to worry about that because they are used to this feeling. This is the greater strenght you guys here have and you should take advantage of this. What don't kill us makes us stonger !", "subreddit": "ForeverAlone"}

I don't even know anymore...", "author": "iDislikeSn0w", "self_text": "**NOTE: This will be a long read... Sorry in advance...**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo let me introduce myself: I'm 18 years old (Almost turning 19, my birthday is next month), avarage looking I suppose (mixed - black dad and white mom), I live in The Netherlands, Europe and am what I would consider 'lonely'.  I go to therapy for this.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLonely as in: I barely have friends, I barely hang out with people (most of the time meeting up with friends outside of college is a rare event, such as going to see the movies which I last did with the Endgame movie), days are spent behind my laptop after college/work and my only real friends would be my parents, as they are the only one I'm going outside with during the weekends to go out to the city or anything like that.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow... I did have 2 girlfriends before, but I don't even know if I could call them relationships at that age, also, I really recently had a massive shitty experience with a crush. Allow me to explain.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe first girl I mentioned I was together with was when I was 14-15. Again, I don't even know if that could be called a relationship, but we were together for 8 months... We were each others first kiss and all that stupid shit We left each other on fairly good terms untill 2 months ago, where she confessed to me she was with me out of pity after I told her I was seeing a girl (my former crush who I will talk about later).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe didn't tell me harshly, but it was a massive shot at my ego and because of that I cut off contact with her.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe second I don't even know anymore what happened really... We were together for 1 month, 2 months or so and it ended badly in argument or something. I was 16 at the time.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnd now to talk about my crush... We met each other via Discord, through a... Yes, I'll admit... A Dutch brony server.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe seemed amazing, she was sweet as fuck, we seemed to hit it off instantly - one thing though. She had a bad break up between her and her boyfriend about 2 weeks prior before we met, but hey she was 'wanting to get over him', is what she told me. We created our own little server with a couple of people in it, excluding him ofcourse.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThen we started meeting up. First time for a movie. She texted me about how I should text her when I get home to let her know I' m safe and that she had a (quote) 'Amazing evening with me \u2764\ufe0f'.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nKeep in mind, our convos got sorta... Lewd-ish prior before we met up. It also got a bit irl face to face, but not too much.  It really escalated afterwards, but I'll spare the detaills as it doesn't matter in this case...  We didn't exchange nudes or anything though, just really heated convos.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThen the next 'appointment' came up (I don't even fucking know if they were dates or not..). We went to a cat cafe in Amsterdam and had an amazing time.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAgain, she kept telling me how 'amazing that was' and how I cracked her up so much, how I was so funny.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nDuring our time together she got really lewd as well in how she talked too me, just like in the chats but nothing happened as well. We even visited a sex shop together to look around, half laughing/half serious .\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo fast forward to last week: she got quiet with me... Barely responded... Until Thursday came around with the dreaded message:\n\n\"Hey so... I'm uh... Meeting up with my ex again next week... We're back together...\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThere it was... I was waiting for it too fuck up, it all seemed to come together too perfectly...\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI texted her back saying I was genuinly happy for her, but we'd have to go no contact for a while until I'm over my feelings. I told her it hurted too much for me to watch at the moment, but that we could talk again later on.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe **FLIPPED** her shit. Told me how that didn't make any sense, that it was a bullshit excuse for me to 'be mad because I rejected her', and it was 'really weird for me to say this now that she has a boyfriend'.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe didn't talk anymore until sunday, because she kept messaging 'Just go' everytime I tried discussing her, kept repeating I'm not mad but I genuinly am a bit sad, but she didn't listen, and that was last thursday...\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThen last sunday came where I had to contact her, since I got a message from a friend who was still in her server that she was twisting the story, telling me I got mad at her for her rejecting me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLong story short, we argued back and forth, I asked about 'Well, why all the sexual stuff then?' and she told me: \"Want me to be honest? It was all a big test to see how you were as a guy. Why would I tell some stranger I'm masturbating? What I'm doing to myself?\"  and according to her I 'missed alot of hints that she just wanted to be friends' (which you know, is hard to read considering the sexual convos and msgs such as 'I wish you were here to cuddle...', and as random as it sounds, jokingly imitating a British accent everytime we were on voicechat/irl after I mentioned how I found it cute/sexy sounding).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAfter that argument she told she was 'very happy with her current boyfriend and that she is continuing with him and only needs him' she proceeded to cuss me out some more and then proceeded to block me on Discord and Instagram the main platforms we used to talk on.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe later unblocked me on Discord for some reason, but hasn't talked to me yet since sunday... And I don't expect her to...\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe still has me on Steam for some reason.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo what's the deal guys... Should I give up? I thought I finally found her, but alas... I don't know... I was probably just lucky getting this far, I barely talk to guys let alone girls so this was literally a 'once in a blue moon' type of deal...\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThanks for reading, and thanks in advance for the replies...", "subreddit": "lonely"}

I realized this girl, I at least thought, I was close with no longer wanted anything to do with me and I had no clue why. We would do so many things together all the time. For months following this I'd just stay home after school and basically would lay in my room for hours until it was time for bed. It started driving me crazy. In late December/early January, I decided to get back into the gym (I had quit that August) so I'd have something to do. I also had been feeling self-conscious about my body because I'm skinny. Now after 6-7 months of consistently going, I'm finally starting to see results on my chest and arms!!!! Hopefully my body will look appealing to a girl if I ever get one.\n\nI usually only went to the gym three times a week so I needed something else to fill in the other two days. My school had been offering to take a free college class at the nearby community college after school twice a week. I decided I could use that as an opportunity to possibly make new friends so I signed up for the classes. While I didn't end up making any friends there, I had an excellent, passionate professor, learned something interesting (nutrition) and I earned three college credits at the end of the semester with a B-!!!\n\nThese past few weeks have been difficult, the person I cared for a lot left me. The THIRD time in my life and it really fucking hurt. It sucks when you barely give a shit about anything except for a few thing and that thing just ups and leaves you without a care. I'm about to graduate in a week and looking back, I feel like I went to the wrong HS and was robbed of my high school experience. I barely clicked with anyone at my school. And on top of that, now that Summer break has essentially begun, I'm about to feel even more lonely. Despite all of this, I've been actively look for things to do to occupy myself these days because being home all day literally drives me crazy. Yesterday I decided to go into the city and sign up for a youth recreation center that seems to have cool programs and opportunities to meet new people. I'm going to be checking them out soon. Hopefully I finally meet new people and make real friends. Today I also starting going through the process of getting signed up for a paid internship program.

Been doing a lot more outside since I\u2019m visiting family in another state. I actually have stuff to post on Snapchat now, it feels weird. One of my friends told me I was important to them (half joking but meant it, if that makes sense). I don\u2019t think people really know how far a sentence like that can go. That alone almost brought me to tears. Also I\u2019m talking to a second (Male) friend about getting a girl. If you\u2019ve read \u201cInteresting title #2\u201d I was talking to him about that same girl. I want to start trying to text her again because I\u2019m a lot more confident now that I can make it much less awkward and actually have a conversation. I\u2019m just not sure if I should. Everything pointed towards her not liking me, including my own self-hatred, but I feel like I should try again until she has the courage to tell me to fuck off otherwise the ignorance is going to torture me. // I really feel like I\u2019m changing so fast I can\u2019t keep up with myself. I\u2019m still really shy and quiet, but I\u2019m definitely a lot more willing to try new things and meet new people. I\u2019m racking my brain for improvement and have been for a long time. And for the past while, I\u2019ve been fairly depressed. Telling myself \u201cYou\u2019ll never have a girl like her. Even if it\u2019s all about personality you\u2019re fucked there too.

She was getting me through the day. She got me through a lot. First person I ever opened up too about my feelings. Never liked her romantically, always respected her. I obviously just exploded quickly cause I needed someone to talk too and it was just a burden for her. It's something I can understand but it just really sucks. When my girlfriend of two years left me by surprise for another dude, talking to her helped me distract myself. Though shes honestly just a super intelligent volunteer therapist who isn't truly my friend for the same reason everyone else isn't. I'm an annoying dick, I try my best not to be but I picked up poor behaviours from my parents and are a dick when I simply don't realize it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nYou know life is a real challenge. Cause only a year ago, I was a senior at high school (I'm a rising sophomore in university now), had like a 97 average was co-founder of the school's largest club cs club, just hungout and enjoyed quality (like yknow..) time with my girlfriend everyday, driving around. Life was so fucking good. Went to university (3 hour drive from my gf, we visited every other weekend or so), man that was the end of mental health right there. University killed me, was way harder than I thought, and was focused on class so much that I didn't live up to other goals I planned to achieve like at all. I had literally no one to talk too in real life, the one friend I did have was far. I was just crushed, morning to night studying. I managed to get the GPA i needed to get into my major (barely) just to not get in cause I missed the deadline to apply, cause my university's emails ended up in my spam folder. My cousin who was really my only friend, was super close, we hungout every weekend all throughout my childhood ages 6-13. Became a fucked up drug addict, who asked me for money, i sent a sentimental text about how he should get his life together, and he just spam insulted me drunk last tuesday night. Instantly ruining what was once such a meaningful relationship. I don't know what the fuck is going on.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSometimes I just crash. Like at night, when I'm trying to sleep (the worst, being alone in my thoughts, the worst). I have to get up, move around, turn the lights on, look outside. Cause I'll have these instantaneous moments of just feeling trapped and crushed, in an absolute fucking nightmare. In high school I didn't really have friends but at least I had people to talk too, acquaintances, people who would say hi back if i ran into them and said hi to them. I literally don't even have that anymore. I have no one, I have nothing. My dad is a miserable alcoholic (was over that ages ago) so can't really talk to him, he always seems bothered by me (definitely doesn't hate me cause hes quite financially supportive), and I don't have much chemistry with my mom (english as a second language, i don't speak her first). I was never even close to them. Though do you get how I feel? When I just crash and, I have nothing, everythings going downhill, and I just feel like ultra fucking shit, and I just gotta get up and move and just look around cause I literally feel like im dying, its hard to explain. I got tinder, even paid for plus, swiped right on so many people, literally didn't even bother on attractive people, and only got one match who just isn't responding. Like I didn't know things were that bad in terms of my looks, I managed to get a girlfriend in high school I thought thats supposed to mean things are okay.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOn the bright side I'm moving towards getting my life back together cause I have time to do it. I'm fortunately not employed so I'm just focused on myself. Working on my technical portfolio (I'm in tech), got into the gym and going consistently, going on hikes, focusing on my social manner and being a better person. Though for fuck sakes I have nothing and no way to get anything.\n\nI seriously feel like fucking shit, and the worst is being alone with my thoughts, cause the exponential growth of shitty feelings. Though there isn't much time in the day where I'm not alone with my thoughts.  If anyone else can somewhat relate, and need someone to talk too. I got a DM for you to slide in here on Reddit.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n06/20/2019 2:56AM Toronto, Ontario\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThanks for reading my ramble. :)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\ntl;dr i went from quite a happy &amp; good life to literally fucking nothing, no meaningful anything.", "subreddit": "lonely"}

Anyway lets get into it. And yes this is a huge vent.\nI'm young, 16 guy kind of young, and straight. Got a job, and I take care of myself. But I'm not an idiot/entitled/ignorant/arrogant/etc. Not a douche basicslly. I wanna say mature but Im not really in the position to. I'm also very sarcastic when talking, but I make up for it. I got respect for people and all that. Including those who treat me trashy. I recognize when I'm wrong and admit it, then try to fix it. I'm calm, understanding, and simply peaceful. I don't hate or dislike any people or groups. I don't creep on anyone, don't waste money, don't hurt anyone, hell I don't even lay a finger on anyone, at all. Also I don't have any physical conditions, or mental conditions (at least not diagnosed, I wont webMD diagnose myself thats stupid). Overall I'm an alright person I'd say.\nThat said, you could say I'm 'rebellious'. I smoke weed yeah, I drink yeah, and stuff like that. Sure I'm not allowed to, but I do it anyway so whatcha gonna do ig. But I don't let that define who I am or control who I am. I do it all safely, responsibly. I prioritize what's important before anything else. Like I said, not an idiot. \nNow, the actual story. I have a few groups of 'friends'. 1st group, 3 other guys, who can be nice. They don't really give a damn about me. Never talk, never check up. Never invite me anywhere, other than to chill for an hour or two and expect me to leave after. Always invite someone else to a party or to do literally anything, in front of me. They dont hate me, they dont love me, but they dont like me that much either. Only times they do care at all is when I have something of value, OR, when they are in need of an emotional outlet. And surprise, I'm the outlet for them. Outlet meaning I'm the place where they spend their negative emotions. We all get along great on occasion but there's no consideration from them directed at me. Sidenote, their interests are mostly music and drugs, different from mine. 2nd friend group, 3 girls. These people are the best to be around, literally. I've only been with them maybe 3 or 4 times since i met them, which sucks. But they are chill with me, and I'm chill with them.  The catch is, theres nothing to talk about. So, there's a lot of silence. Its awkward for sure. Today they invited me to come over to drink and swim, because it's Summer break. Which was going to happen, I was talking to one of them, then another saying yeah I can go. Last text was basically \"Yeah I can go\". Got left on read :). I don't know why, nothing bad was said, she just left me on read for some reason. So I waited, and eventually gave up cause I never got a response. Maybe she simply forgot about the text, but lets face that's probably not the deal. So I have no clue why it happened. The last girl I texted is the girl where we both end up flirting... like no matter what, its not intentional. It always ends up nowhere, emotionally my brain isn't doing great so yeah im a little bitch and havent tried to ask her out. Side note, one of then ripped me off when I bought 'something' from her, but I let that go, grudges dont help anyone. So yeah, theyre great, but leave me hanging a bit.\nNow the 3rd group of friends, the mega party group, about 16 people. I only meet these people a couple times a month, but not one of them really includes me in anything. Dont get me wrong, they're all really nice.We meet up spot, we go, but eventually I only end up talking a few times and getting ignored often. A lot goes on without me included in it even though its right next to me. However there are about 2 people there who do see I exist and call me a friend, which is good, those 2 are amazing.\n-Wrapup- I'm just an outlet for a lot of people I'm nice to. Except for the 3 girls, another couple people who i rarely see, and my old middle school boys I still know. This sounds like yeah I know a lot of people, which is true. But no one has made a significant effort to know me. I don't know if I come off as desperate, or pathetic, or a pushover. I also lost of a lot of confidence and enthusiasm, sinced I placed it in a year long relationship which ended. And imtimate(emotionally and physically) relationships help me feel a lot better but i dont have that right now :). Yeah that's my story, I never get invited or talked to except from 2 girls. Maybe that will lead me somewhere that's better than being lonely, but I don't want to push it.\nMaybe this is all overthinking too, I do that a lot.\n\nEdit: Feel free to comment, if not no worries :)", "subreddit": "lonely"}

I've been this way since I was 9, ever since I practically locked myself at home, thanks to me being a bully magnet for some reason I still don't understand.\n\nI think I just grew to love my own company too much. I learned to adapt to it from an early age and I know no other lifestyle. I don't like speaking nor making contact with people because people don't even understand me most of the time, or make fun of how little sense I make. And the bigger culprit is probably that I don't even care much for other people either. I can't bring myself to genuinely care long-term for another human being. I feel empathy, sure, but I don't want to be involved with them. When I get into trouble, I don't like relying on the people I know either and just try my best to get out of it on my own. When people offer me a hand I feel nothing but stress and discomfort. I often find myself wishing people would leave me alone. It feels... wrong to me to associate with people at all. \n\nSolitude comes with its downsides too: loneliness and depression, but these are already part of me and they actually get worse when I'm with other people not the other way around. I can't for the life of me understand how other people do it so effortlessly. I mean the simple stuff really. Approaching people, talking to them, making friends, 'hanging out', and just... existing around each other. Also it's not like I don't have desires to start a family and have a wife and kids and live normally... I just don't think I can do it and I get depressed thinking about that, and the result is me writing something like this to justify to myself the lifestyle I feel like I can't escape.\n\nDo you think it's bad to feel so comfortable with solitude?

Just a warehouse type job. Now, despite all the shit I'm currently going thru, I genuinely try to go to work with a positive attitude. I go out of my way to try to talk to people , ask them how they are, ask them if they have any plans, etc. But what pisses me off, is that no one EVER goes out of their way to talk to me.

No one said a damn thing to me. Manager even ignored me. I can't even explain how terrible that makes me feel.

Since we were unable to go out to eat on my mom's actual birthday, we decided to go out to eat tomorrow (friday) for her birthday. I planned out where we were going to eat and stuff. My mom then decides to tell me that she went to the dentist to have her dentures (just the rear teeth) repaired, and she won't get them back till next week... which means she's limited to very soft foods or soup.

I was so touched, so when she asked me to date her I did. We dated til we were 13 and then had to break up because of her parents which was a huge deal.

I had very few female friends through High School, let alone a relationship, and because of that I'm worried about my future. I'm very much an introvert and I've only ever had a small friend circle. It's been over a year since I've had any kind of friendship because I'm not in school or working at the moment. \n\nI'm either going to be starting College this September or working full time starting this summer. With either option what are some ways I can improve my social skills with woman and actually go on a few dates? I've thought about using a dating app like Tinder but a lot of the people on there don't seem to fit my personality, or just don't seem interesting, based on my likes and dislikes. My hobbies involve gaming and music (I play guitar) but the style I play is meant to played solo, and I much prefer practicing on my own. Can you have a successful relationship with someone even if neither of you share the same interests? And how do you find someone if most of your hobbies involve being alone/at home? \n\nI'm really getting tired of the single life and I've been craving human intimacy more and more each year.

Unless a woman is using  for you for attention/favours  it can only  mean something good if they consider you a friend, particularly if you're the kind of awkward  socially inept guy women typically recoil from. Having female friends sends the message  you are normal.\n\nSadly  I think many of us are too  awkward even for this. Past school I  never had any female friends, that is aside from well meaning middle aged  coworkers or the partners of male friends.  Women were always too wary,  picky and prone to snap judgements. It hampers my ability to  relate to them now. At 40 I still feel like I'm under  constant unfair scrutiny whenever I'm around women my age or younger. This isn't healthy at all. Female friends would have helped there. It would have been a huge boost if I had had just one genuine female friend  as a young person.\n\nSo take  note...young man... anyone complaining about women \"only seeing them as a friend\" needs to  get some damn perspective  - that is still an important form of social proof and experience  that shouldn't be disregarded.", "subreddit": "ForeverAlone"}

My biggest problem is I can't handle problems ... or any other kind of pressure on me. I'm not too sure what other people do, I guess they just fix it or talk / hug each other... I personaly prefer delaying things by eating. Which is perhaps not the best way to act since it creates a more complex  problem: I'm not exactly what you'd call super skinny. Add a little bit of strange body image/ huge expectations and voil\u00e0: It's a me. \nNow, that was only part one of the problem. I think it's due to a past friendship that broke apart very sudden, followed by years of having only a single person to talk to that I am totally afraid of social interaction. I can do the basics, yes, but conversation? Hell no. I'll always say something awkward and hate myself afterwards. Also I'm always worried about what people think, like about my articulation flaws, my weight, the way I smell. I even fake illness so I don't have to go to school when I look fat. An invitation somewhere is blank horror for me and there's a big chance I'll cancel any plans with people I haven't pushed away yet 10 min before we're supposed to meet. I'm such a idiot to let them down but I just can't. I don't want them to see me when I'm not at the best possible physical and emotional state of that moment. I'm afraid they might not like what they see. \nI'm also constantly afraid they're talking behind my backs to the point I'm doubting the honesty of my kindergarden friend. I can't live like that anymore.\nI'm craving for the attention of someone. I actually set all my hope in finding someone that I can tell all my problems too. And that would hug me.

I shared all my interests to him and he picked up on a bunch of them, especially what i watch for entertainement. i noticed at the 3rd year of our friendship he liked to copy me, especially with the cercle of friends that were close to me but then he signed up to school cafeteria so he hung out with us and them too and he would say \"this is what nab (me) would do\" and he starts kind of imitating me, in my words, in my manners, in my way of moving around while telling stories, and all the sort of funny punchlines i say.

It's 9:30 pm and i'm sitting here on reddit waiting for a goodnight call from my parents. I can hear kids laughing on the campus lawn outside my window. I hear girls singing in the dorm next to me, and all I can do is sit here and self loath.\n\nI feel like such a spoiled brat for feeling this way because my dad paid for this.  It wasn't cheap and I keep telling him that when I get a job I'll pay him back. I really should be overjoyed, and I was when I first got here. I even made a friend on the first night, but I haven't seen her since because she is taking different classes and has a different lunch period and is a commuter while I stay in the dorms.  \n\nThe way the program is set-up is almost like (American) elementary school, where you go to different classes with the same group of kids. There are only 12 in mine. It's been really hard for me to connect with my group, especially because a lot of them are of the opposite sex, which I have trouble talking to.  One person in my class comes from a REALLY rich family. Everytime they talk about their life I feel so inadequate and then I get enraged because I have and will always have to work for everything, and that's why I feel guilty about my dad paying for this. I just get so angry about the fact that this person has never had a problem in their life and never will. \n\nTwo people from my class invited me to sit with them at lunch today, and trying to talk to them was like talking to a brick wall. They just grunted and nodded whenever I would try to make conversation, and it wasn't even like I was saying anything cringy. I felt even worse afterward than when I eat lunch alone. They aren't even the type of people I want to be friends with anyway. Even though we are there for the same major we have nothing in common.\n\nI have only been here five days, so i'm hoping for the best and that this will turn out to be the best summer of my life. I just really fucking sucks whenever I walk around campus and see people who have really been able to click in the short amount of time that they've been here. I always had this idea that when I left my hometown I would find like-minded people and become more confident. I still feel like an outcast, just hundreds of miles away. Maybe if I had classes with more than just that one group I would have a friend. Wishful thinking, I guess.\n\nIt also hurts everytime my parents call and I have to lie to them that things are going great so they don't feel like the money they spent has gone to waste. I am an emotional eater and I just fill up on so much food that my stomach hurts during meal times. I eat a lot of snacks, too and I feel so gross and like i'm putting poison in my body but I feel worse if I don't fill up on food. \n\nAnyway, tomorrow i'm going on a school trip to a farmers market and I keep hoping i'll meet someone there. Not like in a romantic sense obviously, just somebody who I can really connect with and will make this whole thing better, socially. I'm not really sure if there is an on campus counselor or if they even have those at a college, but I really don't feel like i'm in a good place mentally right now.

I'm trying to wake up from this dream. It just can't be true. There's only one thing going through my mind, \"I don't want to be alone\". I start driving to the only thing that I know that would be open this late. I'm not really a patron that partakes in this exact vice, but I just can't be alone right now I just can't be. I nervously walk into the bathroom to start looking at myself in the mirror. It's weird seeing what other people see when it comes to yourself. Kind of how your brain tunes out your nose unless you really try and concentrate on it. I tried that but I wasn't trying to concentrate on my nose. No I was still seeing that it was me. I should probably also say that I'm on acid and the trip is just kicking in. I didn't really notice it since the aggression help me through the drive. I don't know what I'm doing here. I feel disgusted and vile just stepping in this place. It's just this is the only place where you can buy some companionship even if it's only for a little while. I decide that I should just go with the flow and withdraw money from the atm. Well if it ain't just my luck the damn thing is saying I'm out of funds. Did I already hit rock bottom that hard that I actually didn't notice this time? Nah it must be a machine error. I decide that the bartender should be able to get me the funds I need for the company I oh so desire right now. I stumble through my words to be able to communicate that I need money and I need it badly. I need something to go right tonight. I guess he saw how badly I was tweaking out looking like shit that he might have fell some sort of pity. It's neither here nor there all that matters is that i have 60 crispy ones and two bottles of cider as well as two vodka in me. It's showtime. I make my way to the table right next to stage to get a better look. At this point the drugs and alcohol were screwing with my already messed up eyes. I couldn't really concentrate on the girls. I was more entertained with the flashing light going on around them. I just kept looking at them as if I finally found the distraction I needed the one I was looking for. This was all cut short when one of the dancers decides to inquire for the reason of tonight visit. I tell her what happened and she tells me that terrible. She asked if she could provide me with her services. As soon as she said that the lights flashed in her face and I saw a good look at where I was. I think she saw the expression on my face I have a terrible poker face especially under the influence. I politely declined the offer with just saying that I'm just too sad for that right now but thank her for the offer nonetheless. I should probably clarify that I'm not happy about this situation, I'm not happy that I have to pay to not \u00a0be sad in my own pity party, and I'm not happy about what we talked about. The lights soon turn on and it was time for the vermin to find another hole to crawl into. I ended up feeling more empty than when I first arrived so I went back home. I found it so hard to go into my house and go to bed. This just can't be real. All of this is just a dream I must have passed out and I'm just dreaming of all this. I check my pocket to find a bag of shrooms. Well since this is a dream, well fuck it. I down the bag and leave no trace of the earthy tasting mushrooms. I muster up the courage to get myself to my bed where I just start staring at the ceiling. I just want to make as many self destructive decisions as possible today. As soon as I was about to get up again to start my next spree I catch a glimpse of the movies you gave me. I haven't seen the second one and i don't really have any plans right now so i guess my rampage could wait for a bit. I insert the disk and get whisked away into the world of anime heroes. I usually nerd out internally when I watch this sort of stuff but the drugged made it seem like I was actually there. I felt amazing when the hero was showing off, I felt sad when the hero hit a conflict that stop his progress to save the day, and I cried when he pushed thought despite the odds. For a moment I felt like a kid again and I was happy. I didn't know about anything else expect that the hero will make it through this time he just has to. The movie finishes and the TV fades to black. There he is again you,me, myself. \"You know I fucking hate you\", I yelled at the TV expecting to get a response. There was none obviously. I needed something else to distract me so I decide to stare at the ceiling fan while I vaped a bit. I remembered that we switched vapes and i had yours. I hold on to it for dear life because I know if anything happens to it I'll die. I mean I know that I wouldn't really die, but I felt like it so I protected the only thing I had of yours. I start remembering you. I start crying. I can't stop crying. I don't want to stop crying. It just feels right. So I cry until it hurts cry till my tear ducts run dry. I'm so lost right now. I thought sleep sounded like the best thing to do for now. I forgot that I self medicated a bit much so I'm stuck with my inner thoughts all night long. I hear voices that say I should fucking end it. That I'm worthless burden that contributes nothing to the people around me. It would be a favor to everyone if I was just gone. I tried to reason with the voice, but he only got angrier as well as yelling louder till my voice became a silent whimper. I cover my face to find out that morning is finally here. I muster up the strength to get up and look out my window. I start looking at the floor. I'm peggy high off the ground really never noticed till now. The voice told me that this is my chance. Just make my way to the roof to finally put an end to this all. I opened up the window to be able to climb to the roof. As I gaze as the floor before I start thinking how much this is going to hurt. I stop myself and remember that book I read. The name escapes me right now. Its kind of funny that I can't remember the story title anymore. I pull out my phone to look up the name before it starts to eat at me. I forgot that you're still my background wallpaper. I start to cry some more, then I start to listen to old voicemails to hear your voice before all this, \u00a0and then I cry some more. I used to cry all the time when I was a kid even if it was for the smallest things. It's kind of hard finding a reason to cry now except for that one time when my cat ran away from home, the aftermath with my friends, and now for you.", "subreddit": "lonely"}

I'm not looking for attention or pity in this post, I just have no one to talk to about this stuff or at least no one that care or can help. So here's my story.(I try to make it short)\n\n  First of all, I have a very demanding, full time management job (work=home) at a motel. I have no freedom and I dont get breaks (I get to play my beloved video games at least). My boss is great most of the time but he did once tell me that this job doesn't allow for a social life. Five years ago I did want this job and it's my first real job. It sounded great on paper. I never cared to have friends anyway and I never was in love or completely understood compassion but now things are different.\n\n  I face a few obstacles in love. \nObstacle one: I'm overweight, I want to start going to the gym or go on walks but I can't be gone from work long. (Side note, when my friend, Britney, lived nearby we would go to the gym to get fit together, I loved going and it was easy cause we motivated each other and i struggle with depression so motivation is hard for me. We would go late at night when work was slow for me and my boss had a problem with it so I had to stop. Again, he's a great boss just a little(a lot) narrow minded.) Anyway, because I'm overweight I have very low self esteem and no confidence. Not much I can do about it. \n  Obstacle number two: I'm a gay, nerdy, atheist,  oddball that lives in south Louisiana. Not many options for me. And most if not all the options are trash people. I dont know anyone remotely like me. \n  Obstacle three: As I said, my job is restricting. I can't have a social life. I can't be gone long to go on a date and I can't bring a guy here (cause this is my place of work). \n  Obstacle four: I've always struggled with the idea of love and compassion. I know what it is but never understood what it was like until recently. To be clear, I have felt LUST many of times before and still do, its LOVE I struggle with, trust me I know the difference. \n\n  Conclusion: I'm in love, actually in LOVE. But here's the catch: Even though I have seen him and listened to him and learn about him and got a feel for his interest and hobbies all thanks to the power of internet (I'm not a stalker, I promise) he lives in New York and is famous and WAY out of my league, even if obstacles 1-4 weren't a issue. But despite all that he makes me smile on the worst days and we share alot of interest (some of which I haven't tried but would love to). I love when he posts something. We share views on important issues and he's so dorky sometimes. He's the perfect combination of cute, handsome, sexy, adorable, beautiful, and loveable. I love everything about him. At first I thought it was a crush and maybe it was but it's been about four years now. I thought that it could be lust but even though I think he's physically perfect, I just love seeing him smile or hearing his voice. He makes me smile not so much drool. I get giddy and all warm and fuzzy when I see him.\n  So basically the ONE guy I've EVER LOVED is unobtainable and I have no way of meeting someone else. I'm growing use to the idea that I'll never have someone but it hurts more and more everyday. Thanks for coming to my sad TedTalk", "subreddit": "lonely"}

With the American dating subculture, I don't believe that I am well fit to be in a relationship or dating people. My car looks like crumpled foil--okay im over exaggerating--the hood is messed up, my choice of clothing-I don't really care what I wear, just something that lasts. I still live at home with my parents as I don't have much choice as the cost of rent is unsustainable with a temporary job. I'm legit a set of eyes, ears and mouth.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI met up with a friend I've known since high school. We usually go out and have drinks and talk about life. One day he told me that everybody there at school thought I was gay. Not going to lie, I was kind of shocked, then I laughed a little bit because I've only ever overall been with three girls in a span of years. Aside from that, this guy just seems to be always....there, but not there for me. I can't find a better way to put it. One of my oldest friends who just vanished to be with a woman after his mom died had said that this dude(we've all known each other for a very long time) considers everyone his acquaintance. No wonder I say that he is there, but not for others. It's like he just exists almost to spout some words.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI don't know what kind of stupid magnetism I have, but I get attention from girls, but they're either good looking but in a relationship, or they're just not attractive....for a lack of a better term, they're heavier. I don't get it. I just had someone on snapchat hit me up a few days ago to hook up but......she was just not attractive because she was on the heavier side. Honestly, it made me sick. Some would say I'm an ass for that. I try to make girl friends, at least just some connection, but their boyfriends might get mad that they're talking to me. I swear, the girls I get are either not attractive, or taken. I feel like I'm just another person in their audience. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nYeah I've even hopped on dating apps like Tinder and Bumble, but the amount of sarcasm radiating from these people....my lord. I did go on a date from someone on Bumble--first person I met off of the app, only to get cat fished. I can't believe she was stretching her chin out like that to hide this puffer fish looking appearance, pretty scary I'm a sucker for such deceit...I'm not going back there.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI've been longing to make this decision for a while, maybe I'm just predetermined to be like this, wouldn't mind switching phone lines to pay for only talk and text, no data, and moving somewhere or even live out of a converted van or something just to save money not paying rent as soon as I finish up undergrad school. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEnd of rant.", "subreddit": "ForeverAlone"}

I never had any issues talking to people, aside from maybe talking too much and over sharing.

My brother is only 4 years and change younger than me, so we\u2019ve always been built-in best friends, but normal people grow up and get jobs and have lives and the stagnant life you continue to live remains the same.

I have no friends or girlfriend. Most of this is my fault though. I had a girl but I broke up with her a few months ago. I was really stressed out about life and I was worried that the relationship was changing me if that makes any sense. I used to be friends with her brother but I cut him and most of my old friends out of my life because they were nothing but drama queens. I often stay awake at nights wondering if I lost the girl I was supposed to be with. It wasn't like we just had a quick silly relationship it was a real thing. Slowly over time we developed feelings for each other and we eventually just clicked. She was a really sweet girl and I wasn't the best boyfriend to her. Sometimes she would want to go somewhere or do something but I'd just say i'm busy or I had to work or something. Looking back on it I wonder why I did that. It doesn't seem like me. I even felt guilty over the sex we had. I just felt dirty and awful for days after. I felt like a scumbag, it just felt weird having someone care for me like she did.\n\nI really worry that she was my one chance at love. I know I know I'm 17 and haven't experienced the world yet but she really did love me for me. I can't get her back even if I tried my hardest. She's with another guy. She started dating him 2 weeks after we split up. It hurt me but I was the one who ended things. The other night I texted her and told her how I felt. She listened and understood but she told me that it's over and I need to move on and that I'll find an amazing girl in the future. I'd like to believe that but I'm not the best looking guy. I'm short and pretty average looking and kinda boring. I did learn a lot from the relationship. In a weird way the heartbreak was kinda a good thing. I've learned to be a better person and really treat people with much more respect. I really worry that I'm going to be punished for breaking her heart. I worry that because I hurt her someone will come along and hurt me worse. I've learned my lesson, these past few months have just been hell. I've learned that people aren't just objects and love ins't a game it's something you have to take care of and maintain almost like a car. My mental health has plummeted, I do have a therapist but I'm not so sure it really helps.\n\nAside from me losing her I pushed all my old friends away from me. This I really don't regret doing. They were toxic people looking to manipulate me and cause drama over every little thing. I've never seen any other men act like these fools. So I just stopped talking to them, just up and walked away. Told them I couldn't handle the bs and left. Of course they didn't like this but I had to do it. Now I find myself very lonely. All I do is work and come home and eat and I'll play some video games every now and again. I try to go out and do things and find my own fun but I just find myself constantly lonely and upset. I've tried making new friends at work but they aren't really my kind of crowd.\n\nI'll be starting my senior year this fall and I can't wait to just get it over with. I just want to go to college and meet new people and get a fresh start. My dad works as a security guard for one of the local colleges so I get free tuition. I'm sure that I don't understand how great that is, I don't really even know what to major in. I'd also like to join the military at some point in my life. I'd like to have an adventure before I get to old and I've always been interested in the military. If I can't decide on what I want to do I'll just drop out of college and join the military or If I do find something I like I'll get a degree in it and then join as an officer.\n\nI work at Walmart and today a guy who I work with told me how he works at McDonald's from 7-3 then he comes to Walmart and works 4-11. He's had 3 divorces and everyone of his ex wifes cheated on him. I really don't want to end up like that. I want to start living. My cousin gave me some great advice when it comes to life and love. He told me to never be afraid of losing people and to never ever think that a girl you dated was \"the one\" because there are millions like her. I see his point but it's just in my programming to freak out about these things. I worry that i'll eventually just marry out of convenience and end up getting cheated on. I've seen how terrible that is, My mom cheated on my dad twice and it just turned him into a shell of a man. I don't want to be like that. I feel like I'm destined to explore and to see as much as I can see. Idk If I really believe in all that spiritual mumbo jumbo but multiple people have told me that I have an \"old soul\" about me. That there's just something about me that gives off an old soul vibe. Maybe that's true maybe not we'll never know. I just want to live my life. I want to make great life long friends and I want to fall in love with an amazing girl and become the man I want to be.\n\nI'd like to think I'm not a bad person. If someone needs my help then I'm there. I'm a personable person I'll talk to just about anyone. I always try to see everyone point of view and understand how everyone is thinking/feeling. I'm not stingy with my money either, sure I'm trying to save money but if someone needs some cash I'll help them out. I'm more of an introvert so I don't have a super outgoing personality. Everyone at works seems to like me and at school i've had my fair share of headbutts with a couple of not so pleasant people but I don't go out of my way to start problems.\n\nI've been really working to improve myself but It just feels like I'm stuck. There's nothing really driving me forward. If anyone can give me any advice at I'd really appreciate it. I've used this analogy in my older posts but I'll use it again. The best way I can describe how I'm feeling is I feel like I'm on a ship in the ocean. I'm at the helm, just me and a compass and a thick film of fog surrounding the entire vessel. I can pick any heading on the compass but I wont know whats in front of me.", "subreddit": "lonely"}

I know, I know - before I get liberal brigades in the post, let me finish my story first\n\n\n\n\nIn this particular range, we also offer classes for concealed carry and other stuff. Today it was my turn to host a class. I don't mind -- it's kinda fun \n\n\n\n\n\nThe turnaround differs every week, but today I had a total of six people. Two of them were women. One of the requirements for the class is that you have to have both your own pistol and the knowledge on how to use it properly. One of the women that came in had neither of these things \n\n\n\n\nThe other woman in the class let her borrow her own handgun she brought for qualification, and I allowed it. She shot horribly. Why is this important? \n\n\n\n\n\nDuring the entire class (which was 15 minutes late because reasons), I occasionally threw out a joke or two to lighten the mood. Y'know -- because *nobody* likes having to get up early just to have death by powerpoint. One of the girls in this class was 20-something, and she laughed along with almost every joke. I ain't exactly the funniest guy, so it kinda came as a surprise to me \n\n\n\n\n\nAfter the class came live fire qualification (which is required in our state that you know how to handle a pistol before you can get your concealed carry permit), and she was one of the last people to shoot.

{"post_id": "c3y0bv", "created_utc": 1561256720, "title": "Most of us have been rejected many more times than we actually think", "author": "shydude92", "self_text": "I was already having a shitty day the other day, so I decided to compile a list of every girl that I had ever asked out who had rejected me and count the rejections, one by one. I decided to only consider it a rejection if I explicitly asked the girl out on a date, and she refused. I thought my rejection count would be high, but never realized how high it would be.\n\nI tallied everything up and discovered that since the age of 16, I've asked around 80 girls on dates, and 74 out of those 80 girls didn't even agree to a date with me. Of the remaining 6 that did agree, I only went on a single date with 4 of them, and only on 2 dates with the 5th. In all of these cases, no relationship developed because it was the girl that ended up ghosting me, friend-zoning me, etc. These girls came from all walks of life. Some were pretty, some average, a few quite ugly. Some were younger than me, most were my age, a few were a bit older. They belong to a wide range of ethnicities. Some were classmates, some were friends, a few I tried asking out by cold-approaching. And out of all those 80 girls, more than 90% rejected me right off the bat. There was one girl who didn't reject me whom I did have a brief relationship with (we lasted a month, but there was no sex involved because she was waiting for marriage). So basically, I have about a 1% chance of getting in a relationship with a girl if I ask her out, and that's if I still have the courage to ask her out, which I usually don't, especially after so many painful rejections. And people are surprised people like me are miserable. Most people go through life and never have to go through any of the adversity that a lot of us on the sub go through, and simply take relationships for granted. They can't understand that there are some people who for a variety of reasons, some relating to looks, some relating to autism or poor social skills, aren't in relationships because they can't be. As in, even having a first date is a challenge let alone a serious relationship.\n\nAnd it gets worse. I thought back to all the times in college where I tried to make eye contact with a girl, and she would just ignore me like I wasn't even there, or in a few cases, gave me a dirty look. I was ecstatic when I finally graduated because college was absolute hell for me for this exact reason. It would get to the point where I would avoid going to class because I didn't want another girl to ignore me. Yes, I know that most of these girls probably get approached all the time, and cold approach is usually not how a relationship starts, but man, it was hard.\n\nThese are what I call the \"passive rejections\". Most of us have been rejected a few times, or a few dozen, actively, where we made our intentions clear and the girl/guy made it clear that they weren't interested. But then, there are so many of these brief interactions, where we don't even say anything, but we don't get a chance because it's already clear that the other person isn't into us. And if I were to count all the times I've been passively rejected, it would easily be in the hundreds.\n\nAnd this is true for many people on this sub too. They think they've been rejected 10 times, but don't count the time when they went to a nightclub and couldn't find one girl who would want to dance with them. Or that time when they swiped right on every Tinder profile within 50 miles only to get no matches. Or had girls avoiding eye contact with them. The truth is unless you're a complete hermit, you probably interact with many people on a daily basis, and if someone desired you, they would probably let you know. The fact that you haven't been told this generally means that very few people find you attractive and it's a bitter pill to swallow. Sure, the world is large and probably there is *someone* out there who would find you attractive, but for many of us there is no guarantee of ever finding that person and even if we find them, we have to go through so much humiliation and rejection that normal people never experience.\n\nI know life is not fair, and we're not entitled to anything, but God, why does it have to be this hard?", "subreddit": "ForeverAlone"}

No children around my block when i was growing up, no friends there or at school either. I remember most of my days consistently became very quiet, as I'd walk alone and be alone always. And even in a classroom I'd have that feeling of estrangement. Nobody looks your way, rarely if ever does anyone speak of you and to you. \n\nMy one escape from it was a buddy system for the lower grades that we only saw on special occasions, like Christmas. But that was the school, not the people who cared.\n\nEven when i was brought to daycares, i would be alone because i didn't take naps. So an alone child would sit there in whatever room, with only his thoughts echoing in his mind. And i became so much more quiet as i stopped talking as regularly.\n\nHighschool wasn't much better either, and college only proved more of the same. I was a pretty outgoing and silver tongued person in my days as a young adult, but speaking only ever felt like it was done out of a necessity for needs, or to acquaintances that would eventually fade. The people I met and knew were cold to the emotional touch, and always seemed distant to me.\n\nIn life, i have been the outcast since day one, and ever since turning 23 i began to experience how a true loneliness feels after it sets in. A true desolation of the mind, heart and soul. Nobody seeks you, nobody understands you, and everyone you love and cherish grows distant. \n\nAnd i began to wake up into cold, careless mornings that seemed to have the walls feel like permafrost, and my head would throb with the pain of a loud crackling tv static, rebounded by nothing but space, my gaze piercing, but empty.\n\nTo know that you live in a town xenophobic and filled with cliques who do not accept you when you have lost every last old contact is an excruciating, unique pain. There was a spark, but now its gone. And i see not days, but endless night as quiet existence crawls on.\n\nThis true loneliness as been with me so long that sometimes days and nights lose meaning, and sleep is to only wake up again to see the same room, making no noise, just existing as you do. To walk without meaning, to breath without meaning. To be a shell. \n\nSometimes there is hope that something beautiful could blossom from a shell of what once was, maybe a candied shining trinket of speech to convince there is more, but try as one might, this is the reality we have to accept. And so Without people, without friends, without love, there came an almost cruel, and ironic acceptance of what life will be and why. Knowing you'll live alone, die alone, and the whole point of your existence- is to exist for the sake of it, nothing more. \n\nTo accept there is no love, and will be no friends, no more warm feelings of belonging or a purpose to be alive actually feels somewhat enlightening. Because in that sober realization, there's a small, certain kind of assurance in your life. You know how it will be, so it will be. And even though loneliness consumes all, I live lonely laudably. \n\nIt's okay to be completely alone.\n\nIt's okay.", "subreddit": "lonely"}

They informed me that everyone is too busy to deal with me at the moment and that it sucks, that you're lonely.\n\nJust hearing that sparked me off, it was a turning point that made me think \"screw that\". I accepted that I am lonely and realized that I have no one to commit to but myself. Put less effort into worrying and caring for my friends and more into putting more effort in at work.

I'm an actual hypersexual. It's not what teenage boys think they have or brag about. It's a seriously life changing condition. It's usually caused by childhood trauma. I wasn't taken seriously until a few years ago because of the stereotype of guys playing up their sexual prowess. In all actuality, I never wanted to be sexual at all. At about the same time, I hit puberty, became hypersexual, got crohn's disease, and mom died of cancer. My dad is autistic so he couldn't play parent, but he was the only one available. I have had zero energy since that time period, except for the hypersexuality, which works as a powerful loophole. I don't want to sleep around or anything, I want an exclusive partner for life. Since I have no energy, I seek a partner only online or by introductions. It seems like online daters are all scammers, rich travellers who don't want anything serious. As for me, I'm the opposite. I guess it may seem bizarre, but I stopped wanting friends. I could manage one friend, my only friend, the only person I need in my life, and that's it. I could teach that friend how to get me to do anything effortlessly. I could put all of my trust in them and all of my attention. I guess people on reddit also think it's bizarre that I only want someone for offline. Even talking on the phone grates on me. I'm a million bizarre things rolled into one, I guess. Nothing I can do to change it. I like it, it's my core identity. It makes me who I am. People get completely wrong ideas about me every time I make a post, too. People aren't prepared for just how bizarre I really am, I guess. It makes them angry, they're angry with a person who isn't really there. I'm not that person at all.

If you are lonely and you are upset about being lonely, you will always be alone. Reason for that is simple. You are upset about being lonely. \n\nIf you are alone you don't have to worry if your girl is lying about not being out tonight, you don't have to worry if your friends aren't just fakes. It's kinda nice. Find a way to see that and enjoy that. Find lots and lots of ways to cope with being lonely, and find happiness in them. Play a multiplayer game to get some human contact, get a pet for physical contact, be happy with being lonely. \n\nOnce someone sees you being happy and content, they know that you don't need them. You don't come off as desperate and lonely, you come off as a badass loner who's chill and happy. Everyone wants to be friends with someone who's already happy. Nobody wants to be entirely responsible for someone else's happiness. \n\nWas alone and sad about it for about a year. Would hit up dms and old friends and ex's just trying to get anyone to reciprocate. Then one day I backed off and focused on me. Worked overtime and played video games, didn't worry about meeting people and just got to know myself. Didn't really feel compelled to try and hit on every girl who gave off a positive vibe to me at work, or ask every guy who seemed chill to hang out. Eventually a girl started coming in every now and then I started seeing her alot and would often be the one to help her. I never tried to get at her even though it seemed like there could have been a chance to escape my loneliness, I just didn't feel the desperation to do so. Eventually she asked me out, so I said yes. We started dating, and I got to experience not being lonely again, met alot of new people, and got the motivation to quit my job and find a better one. Life has been uphill since then, even though we broke up a while ago, I realized that the trick to attracting people into your life is being happy.

About how I'd cemented myself as a FAer and how I've accepted how ugly I am. I was just laying in bed eating excessively and barely able to muster any enthusiasm for anything (including my job).\n\nWell, since then, I've made some changes. I'm not saying this is a surefire plan to happiness, but it's made me feel better about myself.\n\n1. I got over it: A girl rejected me. it was a brutal rejection (strung me along while a guy she waited for an answer from actually liked), but it happened. I was unhappy about it and went through a grieving process. Then, I got over it and moved on. She's not putting her life on hold and she's certainly not thinking about me, so why am I? If she's willing to treat me like this, then it's better I find out now, rather than 6 months down the line. \n\n2. I started taking my job seriously: I was a joker at work. Although I never slacked off, I always knew, deep down, I could do better. That girl was actually a bit of a distraction (I work with her! Great, huh?). With her out of the picture, I started throwing myself into my work. I managed my time more efficient to get more done in a shift (it's been noticed by my colleagues and higher ups), I've started reading up on other topics to improve my knowledge (I'm a scientist. This has tremendous benefits.), I've started contributing more to the running of my workplace &amp; providing sound (if a little 'out-of-the-box') ideas &amp; improvements and I've started reading more in order to improve my vocabulary (never underestimate the value of an erudite person with a broad, yet deep lexicon). \n\n3. I got myself in shape: Yes! I know this a clich\u00e9 but it did help! I worked on my mind, but I need to work on my body, too. So, out went the rubbish foods (OK, slight lie! I started consuming less rubbish food! ;)), in came the vegetables and lean meat (I only eat white meat) and the liquid I drank was water (not even tea or coffee. and I LOVE tea and coffee!). I also joined a gym and started working out 4 times a week before work and I went for an hour's swim on Saturdays. I clamped down on my car use and walked everywhere, too. The result? In 8 weeks, I went from 79.6kg to 68kg. I'd call that a result! I'm not finished yet as I want to get down to 62kg, but it is important to recognise your achievements.\n\n4. I started being brutally honest with people: This one sounds counter intuitive but it worked with me. I started letting people know that I didn't want to talk to them or if I did have to talk to them, to keep the conversation brief. I wasn't rude or anything, but I stay to the point, then I kept my mouth shut. No small talk. The result? The people who still kept coming back to talk to me, were people who WANTED to be around me. The others? Well, they didn't think I was worth the effort. They wanted an easier ride. Sorry! You want my respect and friendship? You're going to have to try a lot harder than that! I figured this out when that girl rejected me. She said she wanted to \"stay friends\", but I wasn't having it. Why should she get all the benefit of my company (yes, I know that sound extremely arrogant, but you KNOW what I mean!) but I get the \"additional benefit\" of hearing her talk about the men she's dating and (if I'm lucky!) see one of those men with his hands all over her! Wowee! What a deal(!) Sorry, lady, I've got more self respect for myself than that. I still see her at work and she still tries to say \"hello\" to me. I blank her. Not worth my time.\n\nI'm still single and would love to meet someone, but, maybe I'm never going to meet that person and I think I should accept that. But at least, I've done my best in other areas of my life and I should recognise that. Being in a relationship is nice, but it's not the be all and end all. After all, Mark Rutte 52 years old and he's not in a relationship. Who is Mark Rutte, I hear you ask? He's the Prime Minister of The Netherlands. Not being in a relationship doesn't stop you from achieving great things. It doesn't stop you from achieving anything.\n\nSo, apologies, for the length of this post and apologies if you see this posted across many subreddits. But I wanted to get my story and thoughts out there. I don't think my life will have a happy ending. But it doesn't stop me from having happiness in my life....\n\nTake care. :)", "subreddit": "ForeverAlone"}

I wanted to put myself out there, even on just one dating site, because at least it means I'm going from 'not trying at all' to 'actually trying something'.\n\nAt first I was a bit pessimistic about the whole thing, but honestly, it has given me a bit of hope. I've been on the dating site for a day and a half and have a few mutual 'likes' and a message from one of the women. Sure, there's a high chance of it all going nowhere. But the fact that I've worked up the courage to put myself out there, even just a little bit, has made me feel a bit happier in myself. \n\nThat's my positive post for the day. :)", "subreddit": "ForeverAlone"}

I have been through alot lately. A few months ago a girl I was dating for 2 years broke up with me because, \"She was bored, and didn't feel like trying in the relationship anymore\". Back story to that is she was still in undergrad for college and I am currently working on my masters so it became long distance. I would drive 3 hours almost every weekend to go see her, I put in so much effort to make her and keep her happy because she was dealing with the death of her grandfather.  I also was the one putting in the 90% before that. To add to that she face-timed me and broke up with me randomly. We didn't communicate as much because our schedules didn't work but i did my best to make it work. When that ended I felt like I was used for 2 years as convenience since we were both at the same undergrad. She was like the only person I really communicated with so I was lonely after that. I had recently been home and a girl ive been chasing since I was 14 i reconnected with only to be told it was to soon after my break up and that she was working on herself. A few weeks later she was dating a dude she was doing marines training with. She stopped talking to me shortly after. I started my second year of grad school and it is tough and I had noone to talk too. I mean I have my bros from undergrad but they dont understand depression and loneliness. Their response is always \"just be happy dude\" as if it were that easy. I tried all the dating apps only to get ghosted. My loneliness and depression got so bad that I almost went through with sui\\*\\*de. but that night as a last word I contacted my bestfriends from highschool who always have my back and told them everything even about my depression since I was 9yo up till that night. It made me feel better and content but at the end of the day I am still lonely. I am just tryna fine my SO and soulmate to spend long nights with. Im tired of feeling like this...

Even when my coworkers talk about their significant others, I wanna start throwing things. \n\nThe worst part about it is I've tried to fix it. I joined POF last year after three and a half years to try and get back out there. I later joined Facebook Dating to widen my field. I had more luck with FB than POF, but had the same problem on both sites: started talking with women, set up dates, but then on the day of or day before they'd cancel on me for one reason or another. Whether it was not feeling well, an old flame,another guy or kid being sick, I kept getting stiffed. I actually did end up with three dates with three different women, but after that I didn't see them again. And really, three dates out of eight didn't make me feel enthused about my chances. \n\nI've given online dating a break cause I'm sick of getting canceled on, but still the longing is there. I try to isolate myself as much as I can (which is easy, cause I'm a lifelong introvert) to avoid all the happy couples. It seems like everyone else around me is able to find love except me. I feel like I'm destined to be alone forever, and leaving my house reminds me of that. \n\nDoes anyone else feel the same way?", "subreddit": "lonely"}

I\u2019m not sure what I was expecting. I guess after three years of being divorced and several years before that of a marriage that just wasn\u2019t working, I risked the thought that perhaps I didn\u2019t have to feel/be alone for the rest of my life. And make no mistake--*it was a risky thought.* So I put fingers to keyboard and typed out one of those standard posts where I give my age and some arbitrary facts about myself, and then I threw it out into the Reddit ether to see what would happen next. \n\nIt didn\u2019t take her long to send me a message. Maybe a few hours? She lived near me, was the same age as me, and was far more interesting a person than I had expected I might find. After a few days of exchanging Reddit messages, we moved to Kik. Things seemed to be going even better. Based on her pictures, I found her extremely attractive and was even more smitten by her mind than her looks. Even better, she didn\u2019t seem to be put off by my pictures, either. So I gathered myself, held my breath, and took the plunge\u2026. I asked her out. \n\nAND SHE SAID YES!\n\nWe set a date to meet up in a city equidistant from each other. It would have to wait a few weeks because of scheduling, but it was right there. On paper. \u201cGood things come to those who wait,\u201d she told me. I believed her. Another week goes by with seemingly wonderful conversation, and then it happened\u2026\n\nShe ghosted me.\n\nSeven days of nothing but static and radio silence. I kept my composure. *Maybe there was an emergency. Maybe she lost her phone. Give her the benefit of the doubt.* I sent a few messages spread over the week. Nothing crazy or over the top. Finally, on the seventh day, I sent one final message--a simple question. \n\n\u201cAre you really ghosting me?\u201d\n\nAbout an hour later I got a reply.\n\n\u201cYou are looking for something that I cannot provide.\u201d\n\nSeveral feelings came next, but most of them boiled down to confusion and anger. \n\n*If you felt this way, why did you agree to go out with me? Why did you wait a week to tell me? I would have rather you told me the truth right away than let me sit in the dark.*\n\nBut friends, here is where I want all of us to take a step back. The picture I\u2019ve painted here doesn\u2019t look good for the lady in question. It\u2019s true. After taking some time to put things in perspective, however, I began to see this situation in a different light. I stopped taking the whole thing so personally and tried to consider that, perhaps, this person had done the absolute best they could. I don\u2019t know her situation. I can\u2019t possibly understand where she\u2019s coming from, what she\u2019s dealt with in the past, or what she\u2019s experiencing now. Maybe it did take her a week to realize something wasn\u2019t quite right. \n\nWhat if this was actually her best effort? I mean, at least I got something. She did tell the truth. How often do we wish a person had just been honest with us? I got that. Maybe I didn\u2019t get it in the exact way I would have preferred, but that\u2019s not how life works. You can\u2019t expect everyone to handle a situation exactly the same way you would. We all need a little grace sometimes. The dating world can be such a harsh place. There\u2019s no manual on how to do this. We are all just feeling our way around without a clue what we are actually supposed to be doing. So with those things in mind, I made a decision to assume the best of her and not believe she had bad intentions. \n\nIt wasn\u2019t an easy choice. The temptation for me (or anyone else in this type of situation) is to see the whole thing as confirmation that I will indeed be forever alone--that people just can't be trusted, and they certainly could never want to be with me. But guys, that\u2019s not true. I tried to make a connection. It didn\u2019t work out. The same thing has happened to you before. It might be happening to you right now. It will almost certainly happen to you in the future. This is the price of admission. We risk, and we risk, and we risk until we feel like we can\u2019t risk anymore\u2026 and then we risk again. This is the cost we must pay if we want something that\u2019s real and lasting. \n\nMaybe someone broke your heart in the past. Maybe you\u2019ve never really experienced healthy love\u2026or love at all. Maybe you\u2019ve tried so hard to put yourself out there, but it never seems to work out. Either you like them and they don\u2019t like you, or vice-versa. Nothing ever seems to go quite right. And before long, you feel like maybe this whole \u201clove thing\u201d just isn\u2019t in the cards for you.\n\nI want you to know that I\u2019ve been to all those places. I understand. *It\u2019s so hard.*\n\nBut instead of staying down on the ground, let\u2019s get up, dust ourselves off, gather our composure, and think about how we might try again. I\u2019ve already started the hard work of putting myself back out there. You can, too. *I believe in you.* The only sure fire way to miss out on love in our lives is to stop trying. We can\u2019t let that happen. \n\nIf you\u2019ve made it this far, I\u2019m glad. I hope something here has helped. May fortune smile upon you and your efforts at finding your person.

When i was in middle school and high school i was obsessed with the online world, the people on it, and the attention they gave me because i never really got it anywhere else. eventually, all the friends that i made, just stopped texting me, and i think it\u2019s because they realized i had never been emotionally involved. i just can\u2019t get myself to do it. \n\ni\u2019ve experienced what it\u2019s like to have the connection torn into pieces like old pieces of homework you don\u2019t need anymore. i\u2019ve experienced having it ripped from my fingers no matter how hard i tried to hold on. it\u2019s like i\u2019ve been traumatized in a way and my brains reaction was to make me unable to connect. \n\ni don\u2019t know how to explain it, and honestly i\u2019m just rambling and hoping i make sense. i just... can\u2019t do it. i can\u2019t get myself into the friendship game, let alone the dating game. i dated a guy recently who within three days of dating him i was tired of him. it\u2019s like my brain had no ability to feel the affection and love he was giving me so i had no real reason to keep him around. i know it\u2019s all fucked up, but i think it\u2019s important for me to admit these kinds of things... \n\ni don\u2019t know. i don\u2019t really have anyone to turn to because of this. i am a really self destructive person when it comes to my relationships, because i\u2019m afraid of them ending badly, im terrified of being hurt the way i have been in the past. i guess that\u2019s normal but most people get over it really fast... i know i need help.\n\ni need someone patient and kind, really willing to help me sort through this rollercoaster of my brain. i can\u2019t do it on my own and i don\u2019t WANT to do it on my own. i really do want to plug this connection back in, and i don\u2019t care what anyone says, the best way to do that is with the help of people. \n\ni\u2019m not looking for advice, i\u2019m not looking for someone to tell me i\u2019m doing it all wrong... i know me, better than anyone else ever will. i know what i need, and in order to get the connection back, i have to establish it with somebody. i don\u2019t know. again. i just needed somewhere to get this out since i have no one to talk to. \n\nit feels better being able to admit what\u2019s wrong, often that\u2019s the first step to getting better. now i just have to figure out how to deal with it.\n\nthanks if you read all this. gives me some reassurance that someone out there will read this one day and know exactly what i\u2019m going through and maybe even be able to help themselves.", "subreddit": "lonely"}
{"post_id": "c4j5ag", "created_utc": 1561356880, "title": "I really have no idea how to enjoy being alone", "author": "adambebadam", "self_text": "Frankly, the concept seems delusional to me. Humans are inherently social creatures, and craving external validation and social interaction is completely natural, and having that desire fulfilled is absolutely necessary to maintain good mental health. For those of you who have seen the film *Cast Away*, Chuck's \"friend\" Wilson is a great example of this.  \nDespite this, the overwhelmingly recommended solutions to loneliness (as far as I can tell) are:  \n\n\n1. Learn to love yourself and love being alone, because being desperate for human connection drives people away, and only by becoming emotionally independent will you become someone people want to interact with.\n2. Make more of an effort to foster and grow relationships (both platonic and otherwise).\n3. Hang in there; it all comes in time.\n4. Seek professional help.\n\nWhile these are all given with the best of intentions, I have a problem with all of them. Firstly, while 4 is a really nice thought, many people do not have the financial resources for therapy (myself included), and a significant number of young adults have families that do not believe in or shame mental illness (included again, yay!). Perhaps these issues aren't as prevalent in countries other than the US, and if so, tell me.  \nI really dislike number 3 in particular because it acts as if your mental health won't be significantly affected by isolation, and that a person's support system will just magically appear if they wait long enough.  \nUnfortunately, I happen to know for a fact that 2 does not work. People will not respond to your invitations, people will be reluctant to accept your requests, and people will shut you out faster than you can say \"thanks for hanging out with me today.\" Personally, I think the reason for this is as described in 1. People can see your need, so they push you away as to not feel obligated to fulfill that need. Personally, I think this is as only a bit less fucked up than, say, denying food to a starving person at your doorstep, but hey, to each their own.  \nFinally, I have a personal problem with recommendation #1. I dislike myself, and I struggle to be happy on my own. I exercise, play games, and watch shows, but do so mostly out of habit than desire. Recently I got a job, but I've found that money is useless when you don't enjoy experiences anymore. Any happiness I do feel is sporadic, with the duration of my happy moments shrinking slowly and subtly as the days go by. There are times when I'm content, but then I make the mistake of having a thought. I hate having thoughts. They just sit there, in my brain, reminding me that they have no reason to be expressed. Nobody wants my ideas. It'd be a waste of time to express them, though I hope that doesn't apply to this post. Thank you for reading this far, I really appreciate it.", "subreddit": "lonely"}

Whilst I've had periods of my life when things have been pretty shitty, overall, I have a lot more going for me than working against me. I'd say the only thing truly keeping me forever alone is my weight (extra 50 lbs). But knowing that is not enough for me to actually actively push towards getting out of FA-dom. If anything, the idea of having to be truly vulnerable physically and emotionally is so scary, I'm just more comfortable being FA- even though I really do crave that sort of intimacy.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nCan anyone else relate?", "subreddit": "ForeverAlone"}

There have been hundreds of people dying trying to take selfies. Every week there seems to be a story about someone falling to their death trying to take a selfie in a dangerous area or on Mt. Everest where people are risking their lives just to be able to post a selfie and say they climbed Mt. Everest. The culture of self-obsession is causing people to judge us based on the amount of Facebook friends or Instagram followers. When people meet they want to see each other's social media accounts. If they don't have one or don't have many friends, it's a red flag to the other person. If people are willing to risk their lives for selfies, it shows how important being popular on those sites are. Sure, if this was the 90's when I was growing up, I would still be FA, but social media while connecting people has actually made a culture where we are considered even more weird because most of us struggle to make friends and it's like you need to prove you have friends if you want to date. Does anyone understand my poorly worded post? I'm just venting at 2AM.\n\nUnrelated but I was walking home past a restaurant with outdoor seating. I saw a woman and man who were on what looked like a date. I looked and the guy and thought, that's who I have to compete with and I don't just have no chance, I never had a chance. It's probably not true but it feels that way when you look at your competition when you are FA. People tell me finding a significant other isn't a competition but it looks that way.", "subreddit": "ForeverAlone"}

Things are looking up. For the first time in forever i'm hopeful and optimistic. I'm talking to people. I'm talking to girls and i even get a few phone numbers. I feel like something I had only dreamed of is about to happen me.\n\nA cute girl comes to sit next to me in one of my classes. The class is basically empty so i think, oh shit maybe she's interested but i pussy out and don't start talking. Later during the class i can see her glancing at me regularly. I feel like if i don't talk to her, i'm gonna regret it for the rest of my life so i talk to her. We hit it off instantly which is extremely rare for me as I usually dislike people until i get to know them better. Things are going great we sit together for every class, we talk, we laugh. I often see her playing with her hair when she's around me, that's a good sign right? I decide to man up and ask her out. I ask her via text if she wants to go get lunch after class tomorrow. She doesn't answer. The next day she acts as if nothing happened. I'm clearly down. When we leave class she asks me, \"hey are you doing anything right now?\" And we go on our date. I ask her out to lunch again the next week and she says yes. The second date was actually perfect. I knew I needed to ask her out now. Something I had only done once in my life to no avail. I was going to ask her out the next week. That weekend was thanksgiving. When I see her on tuesday, i ask her \"so what did you do for thanksgivin?\". She told me, without thinking, \" I spent it with my boyfriend and his family!\"\n\nWhat\n\nFrom the look on her face, she knew she fucked up.\nI was visibly distraught. That night i smoked my first cigarette in a month and cried myself to sleep. I felt like my future had crumpled to dust in my hands. I decided to not be a bitch and stay friends with her. Over the course of the next few months, we became really close friends. For a while I only saw her as a friend I really liked. I met a new girl. This one led me on for about three months, toying with me emotionally. Ignoring me for days then calling me in the middle of the night. Then she started dating my best friend and they both stopped talking to me. I was completely broken after that, I spiralled back into a depression worse than ever before. It was like some higher being was giving me hope and then plunging me into the depths of despair.\n\nI opened up to the first girl about what happened with the other one. After that we grew even closer. She started being really affectionate with me, hugging me constantly, putting her head on my shoulder. I've never been this close to a girl. I kiss her on the head one day and she says that's a very fatherly thing to do. We were so close that we would even call each other at night and talk for hours. Most people in my class think we're dating. One day, I was really depressed and I said I didn't think anyone would ever love me. She said you know, if i didn't have a boyfriend i would definitely date you. I snapped at her, No you wouldn't. She said yeah. When I went back home for summer vacation, I realised I was in love with her. I have never experienced mutual love so take it with a grain of salt but its definitely not a crush. I think about her constantly, i dreamed of her multiple times. She sent me a snap recently. She was watching something i had suggested on her bed. With her boyfriend . We were talking and then she stopped responding for about an hour. They were probably having sex. I don't hate her boyfriend, he's just better than me in every aspect. I don't hate her either, I never could. I know she's the one for me, i know she could make me a better person. I know i'll never be with her. I wonder how she feels about me. If i had to take a guess, she probably just has pity for me. It's kinda like my mom, she always gives our leftovers to stray dogs on the street but she never takes one home. She feels pity for them and shows them kindness but she'll never actually save them because they're dirty and mangy.\n\nIn short, it never gets better. You think it gets better but it just keeps getting worse. I'll always be a fat depressed piece of shit. I'll always be alone. I just wish i could die in an accident because i'm too much of a pussy to kill myself. I've been thinking about suicide every day for months now. I hope i man up and do it.", "subreddit": "ForeverAlone"}

I\u2019m a 30 FA, never had a relationship, but I do *at least* have a small circle of somewhat close friends. I say *somewhat* because I make the effort to text first and I tend to make the effort to hang out (if we ever do). Basically what I\u2019m establishing is that if I died tomorrow, nobody would know until someone found my body (I\u2019m never contacted first).\n\nI do *actually* work out, I don\u2019t have any major birth defects, my face doesn\u2019t have scars or burns, and I\u2019m not short (not super tall either). I have an okay paying job and I dress a little above average but I\u2019m not about to be on the cover of GQ Fashion anytime soon.\n\nHere\u2019s where **my personal** Forever Alone story starts to take root though. I am *painfully* wooden and boring. Being more on the quiet and soft-spoken side does me no favors either. *Even when talking about subjects I love and am passionate about*... I can **feel** the disconnect from any listener the longer that I talk (unfortunately by the time I realize they\u2019re not listening it\u2019s too late to save it so I just trail off). I\u2019m just not very animated or interesting whenever I talk about myself or anything that I love. I\u2019ve often been interrupted, unintentionally, by the listener.\n\nI tend to be rather scatter-brained so usually if I do tell a story it\u2019s kind of all over the place anyway. Lots of \u201coh shit I forgot to mention *blah blah blah*.\u201d\nI\u2019m good at *active* listening but I\u2019m **terrible** at speaking. I never seem to really know which details are important and which aren\u2019t.\n\nIn my mid-20\u2019s I made the biggest push to escape my FA that I\u2019ve ever made in my life. I\u2019d approach strangers, almost all of them, and just interact with people. That\u2019s what you\u2019re *supposed* to do right? Step out of your comfort zone?\n\nWell what I discovered, *rather painstakingly*, is that initial interest isn\u2019t that difficult but it\u2019s **maintaining interest** where everything ALWAYS falls apart for me. It is so beyond aggravating and enraging. It\u2019s like I can smell, touch, and even *taste* the escape to my FA but **every single fucking time** I trip right before the finish line.\n\nI\u2019ve put my heart and soul into doing everything I can to escape FA because I\u2019m so scared of dying alone. The older FA\u2019ers have reinforced that fear tenfold; I think it\u2019s a healthy fear to have. It\u2019s like a quiet, terrible rumble in the back of your mind that\u2019s constantly, quietly getting closer and closing the distance.\n\nDoesn\u2019t matter how hard I try - I always, always, **always** fail.\n\nIn the last couple months, my little close circle of friends suspending their belief in my situation, have been pushing me to try social media and dating apps as an outlet. Tinder, Bumble, I even tried messaging/adding girls on Facebook that had more than 10 mutual friends. \n\nFirst of all, I barely get any matches. The matches I do get tend to be bots. On the rare occasion that it is an actual human being this is how it always goes down.\n\nBest case scenario is that we message back and forth and establish some basic level of rapport. The thing is I\u2019ve never had a relationship and I have zero ability to tell the difference between genuine interest and normal conversation. For me just \u201cnormal\u201d conversation is even somewhat exhilarating!\n\nOne by one even the sparks die out. All of a sudden out of nowhere the conversation just dramatically ends. This happens every single time.\n\n**I made the mistake of venting about this to my friends**. How I hate myself because I can never seem to keep people interested no matter what I do. How I wish I could be *anyone* else; not physically but personally. The core of who I am is just so garbage, so utterly average and boring in every single way. I\u2019ve tried to change and it never works. You can polish and change little details here and there but the bottom line is the core of yourself **will never change** no matter how hard you try.\n\nThey all say the same bullshit\n\u201cOh it\u2019s not you *it\u2019s them*.\u201d\n\u201cYou just have to stop looking.\u201d\n\u201cThe right one will come along.\u201d\n\u201cJust be happy with yourself.\u201d\n\nI set out to prove to them that none of that works, that **it\u2019s me** that\u2019s the problem... I made a catfish profile on Tinder using a German instagram model on the lower side of a follower count with normal, not-photoshopped looking pictures.\n\n**Within the first two hours I received more than 30 matches.**\n\nUsed the **exact same** bio that I had before. I messaged them the *exact same way* that I had before.\n\nThe difference is beyond night and day. It\u2019s absolutely *soul crushing* how many hoops people jump through when you\u2019re even *remotely* attractive. I never had to message anyone first and they were suddenly **always** super into whatever I was saying. I had more of a human connection with these random strangers than I ever thought possible. They weren\u2019t even kissing my ass just showing me a basic level of human kindness. *It absolutely broke my heart*. All it took was that initial attraction and with that chance suddenly I\u2019m \u201cfun and interesting\u201d to talk to, \u201cnot like my other matches,\u201d *blah blah blah*.\n\nI will never get to experience any of that **for real**. Times like these are why I don\u2019t own a gun because all it would take is some booze and I would definitely rather end it all than have to keep pushing myself into these interactions where they\u2019re not rejecting my physical self; they are really rejecting **me as a person**.\n\nI showed it to my friends and they all got angry with me. \u201cOh well if you didn\u2019t hate yourself and you would just be yourself you could find someone!\u201d\n\nSHUT UP SHUT UP **SHUT UP!!**\n\nI\u2019ve traveled around the country, I love going to concerts, I like going to the movies, I even like taking strolls through the park in the sunshine... but I\u2019ve always done all of that **by myself**.\n\nMost of the time I\u2019m actually okay with it but **FUCK** it\u2019s times like these where life shoves it in my face that **I do not have a choice** that it really gets to me. \n\nI can\u2019t vent to anyone without either them telling me *it will happen eventually* or the other side of the coin like it\u2019s somehow the other person\u2019s fault. Look you fuckheads, **I wouldn\u2019t want to be with me either** how can I blame anyone else for my situation?!\n\nI really wish sometimes people would just say \u201cHey, I\u2019m sorry,\u201d give me a little pat on the back and be done with it so we can all move on. I fucking hate arguing with people about the most asinine shit when I\u2019ve tried and keep trying everything and **nothing works**. \n\nEven if I am forced to miss a massive part of life, let me grieve over my loneliness sometimes so we can all get passed it and on to the rest of what life offers, **FUCK!**\n\nAnyways, thanks for listening FA. I try to maintain hope that someday I\u2019ll escape but it all just feels so impossible and inevitable. Sometimes I just want to die.", "subreddit": "ForeverAlone"}

Then I wondered if I couldn\u2019t play this to my advantage.....\n\nIf no-one cares about me, then cool! I\u2019m going to do what I want! I\u2019m going to be more selfish. And that\u2019s what I did.\n\nWhen people contacted me ostensibly to say hello, when in actual fact I knew they wanted something from me, I just said I was busy and I\u2019d contact them later. Later never came.\n\nWhen people at work we\u2019re slacking and leaving a mess for me when my shift started, I stated to get more vocal about it and telling them (TELLING them, not asking) that it was unacceptable. Normally within earshot of the supervisor. This made the supervisor take notice and they requested they buck their ideas up, too. The end result? Easier shifts, because I don\u2019t have to clean up other peoples\u2019 mess. They still mess up from time to time, but that only encourages me to inculcate them more!\n\nI\u2019ve started standing firm. For instance, a \u201cfriend\u201d (note the inverted commas) came to town and contacted me to meet up. Problem is, he didn\u2019t give me any warning. He just expected me to drop everything to meet him. So, I said \u201cI\u2019m sorry. I\u2019ve made plans (I didn\u2019t, I just wanted to make a point) so maybe another time? But let me know in advance?\u201d. I wasn\u2019t going to drop everything because someone couldn\u2019t plan ahead.\n\nI\u2019ve also started being careful about who I help. If you\u2019re knowledgeable in some areas (for example, cars) it\u2019s amazing how whenever someone contacts you after a while, the conversation will then turn to a favour that you may be able to help with(!)  Isn\u2019t that crazy(?) \n\nIt\u2019s all about managing people. Don\u2019t let people walk all over you. If they think you\u2019ll be at there beck and call, what incentive do they have to maintain their relationship with you? Your friendship is your commodity. Treasure it and make it the best product on the market.\n\nIn conclusion, I\u2019m not saying that these will make you become the belle of the ball nor am I saying it\u2019s a panacea. But if your truly (and I mean TRULY) believe that no one cares about you, then what do you have to lose? If people don\u2019t want to know you, give them a reason to. Then you pick and choose whether you want them in your life. You may still be alone at the end of your life, but at least you lived it on your own terms. \n\nBe more selfish!", "subreddit": "ForeverAlone"}

Lets get started\nSo i am [REDACTED] and my age is [REDACTED] (i dont like sharing stuff like that) and im autistic. I also have anger problems. Before the devil was born i had a pretty good life. I was happy carefree and cared about. Three years after my birth THEY where born. The devil themself. Lets call them E. They are a SQUEAKY ANNOYING BRAT! They cry and yell when they dont get what they want. And it seems my parents care about E more than me! When E does something wrong, i get blamed, when i want to do something and E does not, i cant do the thing, but when i dont want the thing and E does, the thing happens when i dont want it! YOU DIDNT WANT IT EARLIER E! WHY DO YOU WANT IT NOW? TO MAKE ME SUFFER?!?! Thats the only purpose you hold E. And worse, they have an equally as snotty friend. Lets call them V, well E NEVER KEEPS QUIET! After many times and turning up the volume on my headphones while listening to Blooming Villain from P5, (E and V are the villains of this world) i STILL HEAR THEM! They never, ever, quiet down. And E watches morgz! I dont want to hear a morg at all! And in school, (before we move on im an introvert so that may be the source of the next problem), i barely have any friends, and the friend i do have wanted to kill themself once! (Didnt have the will to, he is alright. For future reference lets call him D). I moved classes in that time. Before i moved classes, i was bullied, an outcast. My only friend was him, lets name him X. (He isnt a bad guy he is a friend) X was nice though we didnt interact much. So again, alone. I also had this crush. (Lets name her H) one day i confessed and we became friends, nothing else. (im good with that, at least it is something, they where also out of my league so i expected that), and when this new person got added to the class (lets name them C, man im running out of letters!). And H became friends with C and next, i hate this. They became rude. Ruse, and just rude. Another bully added to the list of bullys, lets call them M, and HN. HN and M are AWFUL people, i met HN in second grade and M in fourth. In the grade we where in way back when, they bullied me hard, when i got home i was stressed sad and tired. It went on for a few months in that grade. And then i moved classes with, lets name him X2 (X and X2 had the same names in real life).  X2 was rude, he was in my class when i moved classes in 4th grade (HN was in my fourth grade class and X2 was in my 2nd 4th grade class). I didnt run into X2 much though. But my new class had another new bully. Lets name them P, P was RUDE! They said they raised an autistic child or two. But the way she treated me told me she didnt know how to parent. In the grade i was in we had two teachers. I had P and, the other we will call N. (How many letters of the alphabet have i used for names so far?) N was good, so we will talk about P. P was RUDE, they yelled for no reasson, (they said they didnt but your reading this right? P is a liar) they got mad for no reasson (mainly at Me and D, and yes D was in the same class), i got the benefit of breaks when i needed them (only learned how to utilize them to their full potential in the last few weeks, aka when i got super mad and sad.) This one time in a break some people from my class where walking back to class and asked if i waa ok? Surprising to me. I still dont know if they faked compassion or where genuine. I also had a crush in this class. (One of the people walking by, lets name them J) my crush on J began in december (the month i switched classes, because HN fyi). The break event happened in about march. Once i told J i wanted to meet with them in break time or whatever. I was hoping they would remember. But I am insignificant enough for that thought to never be remembered. I was dreaming of all the outcomes and what i would say for weeks. Dreams. CRUSHED! (pun intended). I still dreamt of outcomes after the summer (even though i was going to a private school). My one chance was wasted... oh........\nNow a story from 4th grade: So at lunch one time, me and some other people (including M and HN) where sitting at the table, i went to go get something (lets just say water its been a few years) and they put this weird, goop, sloppy joe thing on my plate. I got pretty mad and tried to give it back to them. M and HN denied they did it (the others supported them). I soon yelled (imagine this as a sentence somebody could hear from the USA to Australia) 'WHY DID YOU PUT IT ON MY PLATE, I DIDNT GET THIS, IT IS YOUR SO TAKE IT BACK!' they where scared as heck and took it b-*laughs hystaricly* NOPE! You think a fat kid with an anger problem would make them scared? HM: 'No, you got it!' M: 'Yeah it was on your plate before'. I was pretty pissed and eventually told on them (like the tattler i am). They won the and they told me to 'dEaL wItH iT!'. HOW AM I SUPPOSED TO DEAL WITH WHATEVER THIS IS ON MY PLATE LUNCH PERSON!?!?! I am glad they got minimum wage for that job.\nRight now E and V are calling and its making me ballistic. I asked them to quiet down and they said 'wE aRe In tHe SaMe RoOm Luigi_Maxwell!'. How do i tell them to stop?\nSo this is all i have to say...\nI think i had it pretty bad as an Autistic person with Anger Problems.", "subreddit": "lonely"}

A few months ago, I decided to rent a room to my best friend at a very good rate.

Great first impression, I know. He's been dating her ever since, and as a consequence she brings her here to stay the night virtually every night of the week. This has been going on since he moved in and it's not what I wanted from this experience at all. What's worse is that he knows I do not like her, he knows that I am incredibly envious of relationships, and he knows how depressed I am because of it. Yet he walks into this house every single day and indirectly rubs it in my face. This whole situation has ruined our friendship from my perspective. He used to be a kind and caring individual, but he has changed ever since he got his first girlfriend (this is his 2nd). I want him to move out so bad, but legally in my jurisdiction I cannot as he hasn't violated any laws and he makes his payments ahead of the due date.

So through the years i had few friends and was generally not messed with, i had crushes but some i abandoned knowing time would rob them from me and after that i gave up on dating as well, here i am graduated from school with no emotion on my face as i learned emotions are quite meaningless, with no friends i don't go out or have fun, with no crushes i don't feel anymore and my love is all for my family.  But time has passed where im now tired, tired of being this way, while being single gives you time to do the things you want and study, but you can't have dinner with yourself, you can't feel the warmth of another, and it's that feeling that drives me to escape this and open up, I'm scared of being alone and it's fear that drives me, please please take heed of what ive said and go and live life.", "subreddit": "lonely"}

The same women who didn't want to make small talk with me which is fine suddenly wanted to talk to them. It was such a difference on how they acted around them instead of me. I can't blame them when you see three above average to attractive men and my short, ugly, autistic, self. \n\nPeople tell me how I'm not ugly and how I'm being too hard on myself because I have a negative attitude towards my looks.

I'm happy for them but it doesn't mean I will find anyone. \n\nThere are so many above average looking guys and at the top chads like my new boss. In his case he's conservative with his political beliefs and believes in monogamy only. She's beautiful but if he wanted to, he could have almost any woman. He never gloats about her. He never gives me meme advice. He does talk about the risks of me trying to find a woman. I tell him to not worry because it's not happen and will never happen. It was depressing to see how those women looked at those guys. It's a look I've never gotten and will never get. \n\nSorry for the vent but even though I gave up a while ago, seeing a reminder of my being ugly still hurts.

They complain that I don't spend time with them if I spend any more than 1/4 of a day in my room. Any day. Even outside of my room, nobody talks. Mom watches Netflix on her phone. Dad watches YouTube, that is when he is here. My sister watches YouTube and scrolls through Facebook. We don't really talk, except for the repetitive small talk that makes us feel like we are a family. \n\n\nSimple solution: talk to them, they are understanding, right? Wrong. My parents are self-destructive and will get super defensive against anything that is not in the norm. My sister is 23, and I am 19, and we are yet to be treated like adults. Having recently graduated college, my sister is looking for jobs and trying to get out of the house (too bad she's bad with money). I'm about to leave to my second year of college in August. August... It feels like years ahead. We are poor, and we never hear anything else other than \"we can't afford\" and I understand. \n\n\nDoesn't sound bad, but all of my high school friends cut ties and my college friends are all busy and live a ways away. My parents don't let me do anything. They barely let me distract myself with video games long enough to try and not realize that my situation is bad. I feel trapped. Locked in a cell. \n\n\nToday I went to visit my college friend, Chris, who has had a birthday. I spent the morning and afternoon making muffins (baking relieves stress for me) and the rest of the afternoon and evening with him and his family. We barbecued and played sports at a lake a few miles away. I told them a little bit of how bad it was at home (I am sparing details for conscious sake). They told me that they were always ok with my company, and to be honest, after 2 months with no company, I almost cried. The way back home made me cry and I felt a wave of depression hit just seeing the house. I entered made my peace quickly, and headed to bed. \n\n\nI've been crying ever since.

It\u2019s a cliche, but I have at some point found it to be a freeing, motivating idea. But lately, I\u2019ve been having doubts about whether it applies cleanly to mu situation. Let me explain what I\u2019ve been wrestling with. \n\nA bit about me: I\u2019m gaining on 30 and have been mostly single. Once when I was young, I did ask someone out, who said yes, but I had no clue what to do in a relationship (I was just a kid) and she broke up with me after a few weeks.  That, combined with self esteem issues that I already had at the time, resulted in a subconscious belief that I lacked some invisible component that others had that enabled them to be in successful intimate relationships, and I had shut myself off from any potential intimacy until I saw a therapist 3 years ago and got to the bottom of it. Since then, I have been working on changing my self image to believe that I am a fine candidate for a relationship etc. \n\nI don\u2019t believe that I am unlovable, and for that I am grateful. I am aware of a couple of girls who have had crushes on me over the last couple of years, and I nearly started something with someone last year. \n\nBut I have still been holding back, and I think it comes down to the same reason why I don\u2019t believe I can apply this \u201cnecessary failure\u201d advice to my situation. The reason is this: at my age, now, the women I know are not really in a place where failed relationships are something to be brushed off lightly. If you\u2019re nearing 30, you have to consider the biological deadline of being able to have kids, so the goal of a relationship is to get serious about getting married. I know everyone doesn\u2019t see it that way, but I would like the marriage and kids life. Women my age also, obviously, tend to be more experienced in dating, and I expect to be playing catch-up for a while. So what I\u2019m scared of now is that I might get into dating, hit it off with someone, but then mess it up due to inexperience (the necessary failure that I should apparently expect and welcome as part of the process), and end up hurting someone I have grown to care for, and waste their time, which at their stage of life may be much more precious to them that it would have been if I had started dating at a \u201cnormal\u201d age. \n\nSo how do you justify getting started with dating, expecting to fail badly until you figure it out, when failure will not only affect you, but will also hurt and irreversibly set back another human being? How do you keep doing it until you make it? I get that this is kind of just the essence of what dating is, but I feel like where other people just suspect it might happen again, I know for sure that it will. It seems selfish, and like I should just avoid inflicting my problems on anyone else. Please advise.", "subreddit": "ForeverAlone"}

While I don\u2019t promise anything positive or optimistic, I can try to give you something insightful or even just something to chew over. I hope I succeed.\n\nSo, I\u2019m a 31-year-old gay dude in the UK. I\u2019m doing alright. I live in a nice part of one of our better cities, I have a good circle of friends, a handful of hobbies, and a professional level job that doesn\u2019t make me want to throw myself out of the window each day. In most areas of my life things bounce between good and getting better. I\u2019m also white, cis, male, and get on with my family. In theory, while I\u2019m not playing on easy mode - it\u2019s certainly medium.\n\nThat is - apart from my dating and romantic life which seems permanently stuck on one of those difficulty levels you only get by beating hard mode in some insane time. Since I broke up with my long-term boyfriend several years ago - I\u2019ve had the odd sporadic date and a bare minimum amount of sex (we are still guys after all) but nothing even remotely heading in a romantic direction. \n\nAlso, he\u2019s now married and is awaiting a child with his husband... right?!?!?!\n\nNote, if you want to read a more hysterical and poetic rant bout how shit my particular one person romance boat ride, check out my profile, it\u2019s there in all its screaming and self-flagellating glory. Have at i! \n\nHowever, I\u2019m feeling much better now but the objective circumstances haven\u2019t changed. I\u2019m still worried that my one serious relationship was a coming together of a collection of lighting bolt factors that will never come together again. I missed that shot and someone like me could not possibly be lucky enough for it to strike twice. \n\nEven in this more lucid state, I\u2019m scared to death of being alone and have felt incomplete for years because of it. Honestly, either someone who comes after me is so wildly inappropriate or unsuitable that thing slide or I aim for someone I have an interest in who, and I even know this, could have no possible interest in me - for god\u2019s sake, look at them! Most recently, I went out with a guy who I thought was perfect, He was attractive, funny, ambitious, charming, and full of energy. We drank, danced, kissed...and then he text me the next day saying that we should just be friends. He can go fuck himself! \n\nIt\u2019s not as though I\u2019m picky. I would take and of life\u2019s boorish, aggressive, flighty, angry, moronic, or unlikable guys... provided all the bits are in the right place. \n\nI\u2019m terrified that this cycle, combined with all my friends (each and every one, with no hyperbole) all meeting people, marrying, settling down, will continue ad infinitude and end up leaving me a sad, bitter, hateful, lonely, old man. As opposed to just a young-ish one.\n\nMaybe I\u2019m so unattractive and unlovable that thus us all there is...\n\nIs it just that they\u2019re better at this than me? Should I just lower my expectations and accept my lot in life? Is it worth going on with dating or should I just pack it up and go? Why should I bother? Why?\n\nThanks for listening and I hope as many of you as possible get to the unlikely position in which you don\u2019t need this place any more. \n\nSolidarity in loneliness.\n\nOz", "subreddit": "lonely"}

It is confusing and I am struggling with this feeling. I feel a lot may be because I used to live in a major city so many of my friends are there and especially with pride month, we all used to be together and have fun and now I live in a state that doesn't come close to the pride Im used to.\n\n\nI think as a queer person, Im feeling no connection in my community in general living here but I think being pride month its hitting much harder. I miss hanging out with people who are like me and know my culture and ect. I am on a dating app that is basically hook ups which I am not about but trying to find good people on there for friends who aren't gross or double my age has been a challenge.\n\n\nI am just venting. I was informed of a social group for my community AND in my age group so I will look into that.

For context, I'm 20 and my family is severely disconnected. We rarely see each or talk to each other for more than a minute a day. I still try to talk with them today, but there is no point in trying to hide the obvious fact that my parents just aren't concerned with the problems or events in my life. Therefore, I try to seek connections with people outside of my family.\n\nSome days I wake up and try to convince myself I don't feel lonely. I can bring people together to create lively times, have people who would consider me as their friend, and genuinely care about the people I spend time with. I think to myself that being surrounded by people won't make me lonely. Yet, every friendly encounter leaves me feeling empty, I stop dreaming and realize that there is no point in faking being happy.\n\nOne question that I can never answer is if there anyone who genuinely cares about me? After years of meeting people and tricking myself into thinking I was their close friend, it seems not one person truly cares about me in the same way I care about them. I can't remember when the last time someone has asked me how I am feeling. When I am walking, I can't help but notice when people are smiling and talking with their friends. This is going to sound very bad, but please listen. When I see people lollygagging and having a good time, it just reminds me how superficial a lot of people can be. Their smiles are unconvincing, and this just all reminds me how no one cares about anyone. I just wish there was someone in this world who is interested in talking with me, cares that I am not feeling well, and most importantly, someone I can look to and their gaze will convince me that they genuinely care.\n\nA year ago, I tried opening up to my dad about my loneliness. That turned out to be a mistake. Instead of helping, he highlighted just how lonely I was and said it was my fault. He said verbatim, \"You are the most cynical person I know. Jeez, it's no wonder why your girlfriend left you.\"l Even though I know I'm not a cynical person, and others know I'm not either, hearing my dad say that reaffirmed all of my insecurities. The demands and responsibilities of college and jobs offers offers temporary distraction from loneliness, but it has gotten so bad that the quality of my work is starting to be affected.

Having few friends isn't bad or anything but I'm not anyone's priority and it seems like no one cares about me most of the time.\n\nI just want a best guy friend (I'm a guy as well), someone like an older brother (I'm also an only child). Someone true who cares and thinks of me. Someone open minded and I can talk to freely. Someone I can pour my heart out to. Of course, if I had someone like this I'll return the favor with no problem. Recently I've been crying before I sleep just thinking about how lonely I truly am and how I want a single friend but have the perfect friendship for me. Girls and dating are something that's out of my mind for now, I'd want to have this perfect friendship first, and if somehow I end up not marrying I'd still have my friend.\n\nidk. I just often fantasize about having my ideal friendship and what I'm needing/missing in my life and then realize how sad and pathetic I am.", "subreddit": "lonely"}

I\u2019ve been on meds, I\u2019ve counselled, I\u2019ve handled it far better than I ever thought was possible. But since then, I\u2019ve seemed to fall into a string of relationships where I\u2019m told I\u2019m amazing, beautiful, wonderful, \u2018you would be the perfect girlfriend\u2019, but it\u2019s the wrong time in all of their lives to commit to me? I know for most of them, this has been true. But when it becomes a pattern, you start to think there\u2019s something wrong with you. \n\nMy most recent relationship came out of the blue with someone I had never expected to fall for. We worked together, we lived together, and being an introvert and not much of a people person, it was surprising I didn\u2019t want to murder him. We meshed so unbelievably well, we communicated and supported each other. It was by far one of the easiest relationships I had ever had. But then after 2 years together, he decided to go back to school. And because of how his brain works, he believed he couldn\u2019t be in a relationship, he wouldn\u2019t be able to provide or give enough attention. Even though I am an extremely independent person and provide for myself and work insane enough hours that I don\u2019t require much attention. I tried to be understanding, he still wanted me in his life, wanted to be friends until life was less hectic and we could pick back up where we left off. Somewhere along the way, things changed. His words and his actions didn\u2019t mesh, it started to feel like he was manipulating me and the situation, keeping me in his back pocket. \n\nAfter a year, I told him he needed to give me a decision. He had made new friends in school, a lot of them girls, changed his social habits completely and then it came, \u2018you\u2019re amazing, you make me so happy, but I only want to be friends\u2019. Ouch. \n\nI made the decision that I couldn\u2019t be \u2018just friends\u2019 with him. My heart is devastated, and I feel a pain and loneliness I haven\u2019t felt in ages. \n\nI\u2019m turning 33 in a couple months. I\u2019m an introvert, I work too much, I don\u2019t drink a lot. I don\u2019t know how to meet new people. I have an amazing friend group, tons of support, but I don\u2019t find joy in anything these days.

I asked her out and we hit it off. We hung out for a month and she stayed at my place. Eventually we confessed that we were falling hard for each other. I have never felt this strongly about anyone so quickly ever. I was trying to not be a weirdo and was keeping my feelings to myself. She cancelled her flight home to stay with me longer. Turns out, she was just as in to me as I her. We had an amazing three months together. Camping, hiking, concerts, the Grand Canyon.... just sitting around doing nothing but being with each other was one of the best memories I'll ever have. There was never a dull moment with her.\n\nThe time fast approached quicker than I had anticipated. Her visa was going to expire and she had to leave. It was the inevitable and we knew the time would come. I drove her to the airport and waited with her until she boarded. The whole time I felt like I was going to throw up. I had never been so anxious in my entire life. She was trying so hard to hold back her tears, and I was so nervous I thought I was going to have a heart attack. The anxiety and unease of the situation was unbearable. Trying to be happy and enjoy our last moments with each other was drowned 1000 miles deep from the grief and sorrow of the separation. We said I love you. Then I watched her turn, and walk away.\n\nShe lives 5000 miles away and has her own life and family, as do I here. The connection we had was so intense I can't explain it. It'd be too easy to say \"we were in love.\" I've thought I was in love before, but how insanely wrong I was. Nothing has even come close. If it ends up not working out, I'm sure I'll find another beautiful soul to spend my days with, but I'm afraid it will be unfair to them because nothing will ever come close to my recent love.\n\nThere's a song lyric that says \"I'd rather go blind than to see you walk away from me\" and I cannot convey the truth behind having to watch her walk away again. I would seriously rather go blind forever. If I'm ever so fortunate to ever see her again, I may just die right there on the spot. But I'll die happy.", "subreddit": "ForeverAlone"}

Long story short, but I she was being nice to me and stuff, so a while back I asked her out, and that went surprisingly well all things considered. I sorta did not know how to continue, but I eventually got back into it, and asked her to the prom. She refused, because she was already with a friend, but said that \u201cshe otherwise would have loved to go.\u201d Eventually I confessed my feelings to her, but it came out wrong, and probably made her feel uncomfortable, she also said she did not feel the same way. Obviously I was a little upset, and did not talk with her for a while, but eventually I accepted it, and I tried reaching out, just to be friendly, because I do enjoy her company, and am quite lonely. This takes me to yesterday, were we where went to starbucks, and hung out for a bit. I say it went pretty well, and I did have fun, but it was rather short, and when I followed up with a text she never responded. I honestly understand why, and am not mad, but I do feel upset. I thought I was being friendly and to feel completely abandoned is not a nice feeling.  \n\nOn to some backstory. A few years ago, my parents went through a rough divorce, and again, long story short, I ended up moving to Canada with my Brother and Dad, while my Mum, stayed in New Zealand. Things have gotten better and I communicate with both, but this meant I would lose all my old friends, and was rather depressed for my first 2 or so years. I have autism, which means I am terrible at communicating, and come of as rude, when I don\u2019t intend to. It used to be a lot worse than it is now, as when as when I was younger, I had very prominent symptoms, that are not as prominent. This means I am not great at finding friends. I have just finished high school, with pretty much straight A\u2019s and intent to go to university. I think overall I could have a successful future. Despite this, I am desperately lonely, now desperately bored with summer holidays on, and quite upset after the situation I mentioned above. I am upset that high school is over. I actually enjoyed it, and it was the only time I could get any social life. In all of my years of high school, I really have made no real friends. I got very close, asking a girl out for the first time in my life, and trying to make friends before summer, ensuring I had social media communication and everything. Now with school over, I discovered that I have literally no real friends. Nobody is communicating with me, and I feel like I am being avoided. I don\u2019t want to go through university, only to get close to making friends, before probably never being talked to again. I have done it so many times that I am tired. I want someone to care about me\u2026 But I don\u2019t know how at this point. Everything I read says to improve myself, exercise, get good grades, and then to just communicate, and \u2018be yourself\u2019. I have tried all that, I am healthy, I like to think I relatively intelligent, I have interesting hobbies (although I am losing interest after beginning to lose all inspiration) and again, am doing well academically, and I have tried so damn hard to communicate and make friends with people, to absolutely no avail. My autism, means being myself can come off awkward, and even rude, but trying to be someone I am not is just impossible. I don\u2019t know what to do. At this point, how do I make friends?

I'm afraid of having them judge me, criticize me, etc. My anxiety gets so bad when I'm in public.\n\nOr say I'm out at night time (Which is always when my shift at work ends). I'll be clocking out from my shift, close to midnight. Driving isn't an option for me because I can't even afford a vehicle. I take public transit where ever I need to go, but I also try to avoid it if I can. I get extremely nervous at night time, if I'm out walking to the bus. I live in a city of a million people, so chances are I'll probably see a crazy person at the bus stop or just someone looking for trouble. This really pumps my fear of being robbed or murdered by a stranger. So wanna know what I do in order to avoid taking public transit at night time? I take a freaking taxi/uber home instead.

But in my mind, it's worth not getting robbed of everything on me or having some random stranger end my life.\n\nAnother thing, is if someone confronts me or tells me I'm doing something wrong even if something is not my fault, I will automatically believe them, apologize, feel terrible and pathetic, etc. I just can't ever rack up the courage to stand up for myself, even if I am right. My extreme anxiety and feelings of low self worth prevent me from doing so. I'm afraid of messing up. I'm afraid of people labeling me as something negative. I'm afraid of feeling humiliated. I'm afraid of anything socially imaginable.\n\nAs a result, I'm an introvert probably 90% of the time, and I despise having to go to work or just to go out in general.

The \"free\" therapists I tried seeing at my school basically did nothing to help me. I believe this is also another reason why I'm FA. Not only are my below average looks and social awkwardness to blame, but also my submissive cowardly vibe. Most girls only seem to want confident above average looking guys, not some below average guy who is insecure and afraid all the time like me.\n\nThis has been destroying me since I was a teenager (I'm nearing 21), and I feel it's only getting worse as I get older.\n\n\nToo Long Didn't Read: I'm the most afraid person I know. I'm scared of everything. I'm scared of being judged, criticized, or robbed/murdered by a random stranger, and so on. I can't stand up for myself. I hate going outside. I can't afford a therapist. I also blame this on my FA status and it's only getting worse.", "subreddit": "ForeverAlone"}

Everything changed at the end of the second class, I attended a graduation party at one of my classmates house and at the end of it she hugged me and everyone else goodbye. It was the most personal attention I've ever received, so I started to develop feelings for her, as we talked more and more I found out how wonderful of a person she really is (if I've made a list of best things a girl can have, she would have them all).\n\n A month ago I started massaging her regularly, that's when I realised my feelings, I started to talk to her about my problems, my loneliness, my lack of contact and that I value the life of someone I live over my own. She said it's very unhealthy to think that way and that I need to think about myself sometimes. I also started messaging her friends at that time (they were all my classmates so it wasn't hard) they all said that she isn't in love with anyone now and that she wants to have a relationship out of her own love.  I didn't want to tell her my feelings because of fear that I'd loose her and that would devastate me and leave me with no meaning in life.\n\nA few days ago I accidentally told her my feelings while we were talking about our friend's relationships. She didn't seem surprised, she knew from the start that I developed feelings for her and was waiting for me to finally realise them myself.\nAfter some talking I wanted to invite her over to my house as I was organising a small class meeting, she told me she isn't sure she can be there, so I told her that there's no sense for me to organise it if she can't come. She said that I need to stop worrying about her and go and focus on the others, I told her that I can only focus on her. She said that if I can't distance myself from her, then she will stop talking to me so it would be easier for me to forget about her. I was devastated I know if I loose her I will loose all sence in life so I quickly said that I don't want her to leave now, I want to have as much happy moments with her as I can. After that, she said that I should message her when I can finally think healthy.\n\nNow she is offline, I keep messaging her about being sorry for falling for her , I know she will leave me one day, but I want to at least be happy with her for a little longer and keep that day as far as I can. I know it won't make a difference if she leaves me today or in 3 years it will still destroy me no matter what so I just want to be happy for a little longer.", "subreddit": "lonely"}

I just went ghost because I was going through some challenges.. They went on how  they wanted to text and all but didn't wish to bother me once I texted back and felt silly about thinking like that toward texting me.. And recently this reappeared for me in thought(the you're in the back of my mind-thing)  I looked up the meaning  and it basically said \"unimportant or too little effort to care about\" is this me being too literal and maybe they meant as \"I was thinking about you here and there\" Of course I can ask and  will but  \n\npart 2) of this is: recently..I tried to delete myself from the program called \"Life\" I feel like I am full of errors.. and maybe all this is life's  way of removing a problem by showing me I don't belong. They reached out awhile back and asked if I was okay because..I ghosted again--because once more I just felt like this stain..And seeing them do this confused me. I feel I had a chance to speak how I felt but didn't know how? So I told them thank you for a lot and how I saw them as this character to my person (I sometimes compare tv show characters to express my emotion toward people. Like \"you're my Watson to my Sherlock \" for example) then I  deleted the way we mostly talked and most of all didn't give them a chance to reply. I feel like being real with them because its stupid I ghosted but I want to explain myself..I just don't know how? Maybe its too late and they're better off?

Do my friends actually want to hang out?", "author": "jfreeman1506", "self_text": "Not sure if this is really the right forum to post this on but I needed to post somewhere. I've never been good at making friends and I only really have one or two people I would still say are good friends all of which are left over school friends. By the end of school I'd say that I had four but two of them never respond to my texts anymore so I never meet them. By the way one of them goes to the same University as me so its ridiculous that he doesn't seem to want to just meet and chat for an hour. The third I still consider a friend but he's just a very busy person and its rare that he's free to meet. \n\nThe fourth friend of mine is probably who I consider my best friend as I'm actually able to meet up with him at least once a month. But I've noticed recently that almost everytime we meet up its because I text him. Its the same with any of my friends and with a few exceptions its more or less always been this way. Apart from big events and birthdays I was almost always the one arranging things. In the last two years I can't think of a single time where I've just been invited out by someone except for a class reunion and some gig my friend was playing at one time. Basically we never meet unless either I text them or my friend has some big thing going on.\n\nI'm fairly certain if I never texted my old school friends they would never contact me and we'd be lucky to meet up once a year. It just got me wondering whether or not they actually still want to meet with me. They don't seem very interested and what got me thinking about this was what happened today. \n\nI had arranged to go bowling with that one friend I still meet a lot and he said yesterday that he was free and we agreed on a time to meet. I had something important to do that day but decided not to do it in order to keep time free so I could meet with my friend since its really only a monthly thing. The next morning I texted him first thing to make sure it was still on. Several hours passed and he still hadn't replied. I eventually assumed he'd just meet me down there since he said he would so I headed down there. Checked the place where he worked. Called him four times. Waited an extra twenty minutes then went home. I don't have a problem if he couldn't come but I at least think he should've had the decency to cancel. If he had done that I could've done what I was supposed to and have a productive day but instead I left the day free for him and now I'm just sat around at home.\n\nI guess what I'm getting at is that I feel like I'm putting all my effort into these friendships while my friends don't really seem to care. I get that its been a few years since the end of school and most people have moved on and have made new friends. But I don't see why that should have an affect on past relationships. Especially when we don't live too far from each other. I tend to drop anything that isn't really important to meet up with my friends but it doesn't feel like they would do the same for me.\n\nSince I left school I've tried to move on from them and make new friends. As someone on the autistic spectrum that's not very easy for me to do. My old school is probably the only place that I ever considered myself popular. I've made a grand total of one friend since I left and he lives like seventy miles away so do the math. At Uni I do have a social life in that I'm part of a few societies and have fun with the people there but there's nobody I've connected with on an individual level. So naturally I'm left trying to connect with my old friends during the holidays. The holidays are a lonely time for me when I'm basically just sat at home completely alone with nothing to do. But of course it doesn't feel like they care enough to put in the effort. Even when they do meet up it partially feels like they're just doing it out of some obligation as opposed to them just wanting to be there.\n\nAm I overreacting here.

I posted this sad story on r/addiction and r/depression yesterday, but no one replied so I guess that proves I'm forever alone.\n\nI have an underlying problem of depression I think. It mostly started after my father took me to a hockey game.\n\nI remember it very vividly. It was the Cincinnati Cyclones versus their rivals, the Hornets. I was sitting with my father enjoying the match, but I could not shake a sense of hollowness despite the enjoyment of the match. My father is not a perceptive man, so I do not think that he noticed my depressed demeanor. But I truly felt a nothingness inside of me that would not go away. I tried to smile and engross myself in the match, but this hollowness just kept pulling me away.\n\nIt felt like my mind was being separated from my body, like I was dissociating. There was the me, sitting there watching the sport with my father. But there was also the sense of self that was watching the match, separating from the scene by this invisible barrier that I could not overcome. I was detached, despondent, dejected, and depressed. At what should have been the happiest moment of my life, spending time with the man that I craved to grow up to be, I was the most alone I have ever felt.\n\nThis was many years ago, but the feeling has not ceased lingering. I wake up in the morning with a complete sense of detachment. When I am eating my breakfast in the morning, I fail to feel like I am present. I cannot smell the scent of my meal, and I do not even feel as if I am consuming the food. I am a hollow puppet. I feel like I control my body remotely, and I am left as a shell of myself.\n\nAnyways, after I became this shell was when I started to eat. I would eat at all hours of the day, even while I had other things to do. My favorite meal was cake. Chocolate cake. I would lick the frosting off first and then I would go for the fluffy insides. I developed a sickness that I would express through eating cake. I enjoyed making myself suffer. I knew that my life was meaningless, uneventful, so I would rub in this depressing fact by purchasing birthday cakes meant to celebrate important events.\n\n\"Happy Birthday, Linda\"\n\n\"Congratulations on the promotion, Tony\"\n\nI would love to purchase one of these cakes, and I would always eat the lettering first. I would eat it slowly, first by licking the C, then the o, until my tongue had tasted the entire congratulations. My taste buds would explode with the combination of depression and pleasure. I felt like I was eating the enjoyment of others, and I was in love with this dark secret. The pure ecstasy would bring me back into myself, and I could escape from the hollowness that I first experienced at that hockey game.\n\nEventually, my cake eating became an obsession. My parents thought I had a bit of a sweet tooth, but they started to wonder why I was purchasing chocolate cake at such a fast rate. They tried to stop me. But I did it in secret. They would question the chocolate goodness that stained my fingers after a night of pleasure, but they were helpless in curbing my addiction. I would feast, and it reached the point where it occurred every single night. I would purchase an entire cake and slowly consume it over the hours of the night.\n\nAs this progressed, you can imagine that my weight began to increase. I started to run slower, breathe heavier, and the short, daily bike ride to the local grocery store became an intense physical activity. I would barely manage to make it to the store, and I was sweating heavily by the time I made it into the store to purchase another supply of chocolate cake. But it did not matter. My addiction pushed me through the suffering of physical exercise.\n\nOver time, however, I realized that I needed to change. I began to read self-help books and I quickly became knowledgeable on the subject. I could not allow my chocolate cake addiction to continue to be my sole reason for living. I needed another way to bring myself back into reality. So I quit, cold-turkey. It was the most challenging thing I have ever done in my entire life. Over time, the stain left my fingers and the weight left my stomach as well. I began to become slim again, but as I was returning to my old form I regained the negative parts of it as well. I became entirely detached, and as I became re-accustomed to this grueling state I began to eat again.\n\nIt's been six months since I pulled the notorious receipt listing six chocolate cakes from the self checkout machine at my local grocery store. It only took me three days until I repeated this deplorable action. I have gained 50 pounds in only half a year, and I fear I no longer have the willpower to change. It seems my only option is to eat myself to death. Most people are buried in soil, but I will be surrounded by the brown crumbs of chocolate cake.\n\nTL;DR: I ate chocolate cake to cure hockey game depression. Then I turned my life around through the power within. Now I'm back on the dark path of sweet chocolate goodness, and I'm suffocated by the weight of this struggle.

I'm due to graduate soon, and I'm supposed to go get myself a house and a job. The plan was to do this together, but now it's going to be just me. I find the thought appalling. Were you in a similar situation? How did it turn out?", "author": "TreasureFries", "self_text": "Hey there lovely people,\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSome more background information, for who is interested?\n\nTL:DR in the end\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI would say this is the first time I'm really without a partner by my side. I'd say I've had two relationships: one starting when I was 17 and ending when I was 22, closely followed by my recent relationship that lasted just over a year.  In what little space there was between, I did have myself a bit of a slut phase, so I can't consider myself very 'single' for that period. \n\nBefore I got into my first relationship, I lived with my parents still. I have since moved to another city in order to study veterinary medicine.  Being a good student and enjoying the company of my partner have been the two focal points of my day to day life during the past six years at uni.  With both partners I have planned on, but never actually went through with, living together. It's been me in my own student accomodation thing on campus, and them close by so we got to spend most of our free time together. \n\nNow I have so much time on my hands all of the sudden. I greatly miss having someone to come home to. Someone to vent about your tough day to,  someone to cook a meal for, someone to cuddle. All the good stuff. I miss someone to love, what a surprise.\n\nThe most daunting thing right now is my graduation. What am I going to do after that? Most likely find myself a job, I'm going to need to generate some income. Very likely this new job will have me move from my city, as it is very hard to find a job as a vet right here, and chances are much better an hour away.  I have to move out of my house anyways, as only students can live on the campus.\n\nI very much dislike the idea of living in some apartment by myself. Dragging myself out of bed every morning to go spend the day at a job I fear I might hate, only to come home by myself and try to work up the motivation to make some actual food. Then ??? for the rest of the night so I can go to sleep and repeat this the next day. I know I'm making this to be the most negative it can be, but this scenario seems very very realistic to me. \n\nAn additional thing I'm worrying about is how to ever cross paths with a new partner. For now, I'm good and I very much need some time by myself. In the longer run though, I'm really not excited to live life by myself. Perhaps a little too focused about this? Eh. Here in the student city I now live in, I'm practically surrounded by attractive men who are around the same age, intelligence and life phase. When I move into the periphery I'm not going to be running into them as I am now. I'm a very shy and introverted person, and I tend to stay away from hobbies and activities that have me interact with new people a lot. (also I just tend to not interact with these attractive people I see around).\n\nI'm very fortunate to have few, but very very good friends. They would be a reason for me to stay in my city a bit longer, were it now for them also going to graduate and move themselves in the near future. This general uprooting of basically my whole life is very, very scary.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTL;DR: Let's get to the point finally. I'm very likely going to be living a new life all by myself, where I envisioned to take these steps (house and job) together with a partner. Additionally I'm fearing some long-term loneliness as the friends around me are moving away too, and I expect my chances of running into a new mate get a lot smaller when I start work. I don't connect easily and have some social anxiety going on. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI think there must be a lot of other people that have been in a similar situation. Did you move to a new house and start a job? How did it feel? Did you manage to get comfortable? Were you able to get into a good rhythm? Did you meet new friends in your new situation? How are you feeling now?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm very curious as to how this turned out for you. Any stories and advice are greatly greatly appreciated! &lt;3", "subreddit": "lonely"}

New Redditor and new to this subreddit, but I felt it might help me just reach out to people.\n\nLittle about me: I\u2019m a recent college-grad and soon-to-be grad student, but I\u2019m still waiting a few months to go to grad school. I took a year off before applying to grad school, and am back at home with my parents.\n\nWhy I\u2019m lonely: I\u2019m lonely because I have not been able to find a job. I studied English and Theatre, but as a humanities kid in a tech-heavy town, I just didn\u2019t want to work my hundredth job in Sales or HR. I want to teach, I want to make art, but those gigs don\u2019t work in the summertime and/or don\u2019t pay. My high-school friends are all in grad school on the West Coast (I\u2019m on the East Coast), and avoid texting whenever possible. My college-friends all have jobs, and are the same way about communicating. My girlfriend of five years (we love each other very much) is a Park Ranger who is (unfortunately) stationed in Oregon for the next five months, and without a good cell signal to communicate. Finally, my younger sister is still in college, and works on-campus over the summer so we can\u2019t hang-out.\n\nI don\u2019t have anybody to commiserate with, my therapist even said (because I JUST started therapy to deal with anxiety and depression) that I am\u2014and I quote\u2014\u201ca very, VERY lonely man.\u201d\n\nI can\u2019t find work that will pay and be willing to train me before grad school. But my parents come home and resent me everyday for sitting about and being sad. I stopped going-out with friends, and I only play video games to make the sun go down so I can go to sleep again.\n\nI know this is only temporary, but it hurts like hell sometimes.

I have been battling anxiety and depression issues for almost my whole life. My grandfather died in 1999 very tragically, and it tore my Mom apart. She began drinking and smoking and becoming a nasty person. She took it out on me and my brother for most of our lives, and our father kinda let it happen, claiming she was just \u201cventing\u201d. \n\nGrowing up in this, I became very anti-social, awkward, and paranoid of the people around me. Every friend I had growing up took advantage of the kindness I would try to give and would hurt me in some way, whether that be stealing or bullying. \n\nThe cycle has repeated since then and even till now, post college. The only friend I have had for a while is so wrapped up in his life that I never see him, and when I do he doesn\u2019t want to do anything, and doesn\u2019t like drinking. Other friends are always busy and seem to change plans last second to exclude me. Its always \u201cThis day works better for everyone\u201d or \u201cI forgot about this thing I have to do\u201d. \n\nI was in therapy and seeing a psychiatrist for 4 years and made great improvements to my confidence and general outlook in life, and have seen my mom become better in recent years and have gotten much closer to her. I am a fan of drinking and smoking weed but also know to stop at certain points and refuse to do any of it if I am emotional.\n\nNow to today:\n\nI recently moved out on my own and have been getting an overwhelming sense of loneliness. No one at my work seems to see me as more then a co-worker, no one from my college classes seem to hit me up, and I just don\u2019t know where to go from here. I am on dating apps trying to meet people, I go to the gym, I hit up local stores a-lot, and really try to meet people, but nothing has come from it. \n\nAm I wrong for wanting someone to hit me up and ask ME to do something, rather then always being the one to initiate something?

I thought finally after seeing everyone\u2019s pictures and stories on social media of going out on Friday nights with friends and doing fun stuff that it was finally my turn. But me being socially awkward I didn\u2019t say much. She did keep looking out for me asking if I was having fun or how I looked bored. I tried to be social but all of her friends knew each other and were talking to each other about personal things and I didn\u2019t really know any of them and I\u2019m just very awkward and well you know how we are in this sub with just no practice at being that social with people we just meet.

I feel like it is, but I also think I'm wrong. It's times like this at 1.40 in the morning where I feel the most alone. I have fast beat music in the background to help me write. I usually send these late night pieces with a friend, but this I feel should remain solely on my person. I lay on the couch, as I have been nearly everyday for years. I just wish I could share it with someone. I understand that this is not the way to obtain a partner. I fear the real approaches. I am not forward at all. Most if not all of my emotion is a front. Sure, I have a sense of humour, and sure I can be sympathetic. But the bravery and strength? Fake. I am not strong. I am not brave. I feel weak all the time, and hate the little control I have over my own life. I fear circumstance and general happenings. I have no clue what my future will be, and I try to forget about it all. I understand that relationships in high school are not meant to last, but I feel like I need someone. I've slipped into an old habit of need for physical touch, touch from someone I could care for. I do not mean my family. I do not enjoy my family. I understand that they provide for me, but I also feel like a captive. I am expected to do many things with my life, and I am expected to love. Love is not a thing to be expected. That is disgusting. Love is supposed to be natural. Despite my lack of first hand love, I know what it is not. Sometimes I imagine the perfect partner I believe I could have. It is personal, something I don't think I could ever write down. Just know that she is loved, her reality be damned. Is it wrong to hold a pillow as you would a lover, in lieu of someone to hold at night at all? I hope it isn't. Many people my age feel as though sex is the penultimate goal in life, to which I deny. I feel like having someone at your side is better. I've had close encounters with both. I firmly believe in the latter choice. Never in my life have I had a more genuine feeling of happiness than when holding someone I care for in my arms. Albeit, one of those times was as a friend, and another a relationship that never was. Is it wrong to want to hold a woman? As in, to just sit under a tree or on the roof and just coexist? Is it a moral shame, to want nothing more than that? I understand that writing this down will not solve my problem. In all honesty, I would love nothing more than to have someone else approach me instead of my fruitless attempts to go about it myself. I have no tropes to exhaust when it comes to romance. My friends are just that. I know no one well enough to become more than that. Those that I do know that well are already 'taken,' as it were. That's fair. Either they expressed no interest in me that way, or I did not act. Either way, what isn't isn't. I cannot change that in a fair way. I feel like sitting here and typing is pointless. I wish I never had to do this. I wish I had someone to hold. To talk to honestly. To be around. To help. To love. To care about.\n\n\nI'm sad now. I am getting slow in my words.

Basically my point is it's better to do stuff alone than sit indoors all day, if you never go out and do what you would like to do with friends you won't know how to when you do make friends, and you are a lot less likely to make friends or meet anyone new.

This is  just a personal rant for myself. )\n\nI'm wasting my life away. I've already wasted my childhood years either being stuck in front of the tv or computer because I have terrible parents who didn't play an active role in raising me, they never took me out, never went on holidays with us, never let me join sports or have hobbies and never helped me in any way to build my confidence or social skills. So I'm already behind everyone else. I've never had any friends, I've never gone to any festivals, I've never been invited to a party, I've never done any of he normal things people do in their youth. This is partly because of my lack of social skills and partly because of my horrible, strict parents. I just hate my life. Simple things like going out with friends, going to parties, having your first kiss, being a part of a group, come so simply to other people. Why is it so hard for me? I just want to belong, I want to feel normal. I want some sort of positive reinforcement from real people. There are 13 year olds out there who have more interesting lives than I do. I don't do anything with my time. I have no hobbies, I'm not part of any sports or clubs, I have no friends, no significant other. There are so many people from my school posting pictures and videos on instagram showing the holidays they're on with friends right now. They're enjoying themselves and living out their young years. I'm stuck at home in front of my phone.  I want to be out there, I want to live my life, I want to enjoy the sun while it's out  in summer but how can I when I have no friends to go out with? And how can I make friends when I haven't developed my social skills since I was 8? I also have no self confidence to \"put myself out there\" because of my emotionally and physically abusive parents. I hate this so much. I feel trapped.", "subreddit": "ForeverAlone"}

Everyone who came into my life drifted out of it again just as easily and permanently.\n\nI'm not ugly. I am not weird, necessarily. I am just... nothing. You would see me and think I am just another old man. You would assume I probably have a wife, kids, grandkids waiting for me at home. I don't. Truth is, I have nothing waiting for me at home. Or anywhere else, for that matter. All I have is my own thoughts, and those are my constant companion from which I cannot escape.\n\nWhen I was in my early twenties I had moments where I could go to a party, even alone, or a bar or gathering or whatever and get pissed drunk... and I would be sociable, if only for a night. I would feel human, however briefly. Then I sobered up and the feeling left me. By the time I reached my late twenties, I couldn't even do that anymore... no matter how much I would drink, I would still feel lost, out of place, uneasy... and I lost the only clutch I could have had. \n\nNothing gives me joy. But on the up side, nothing gives me too much pain anymore either. I wish I had what my peers growing up had... but I never did. \n\nAt times it kills me to imagine all my high school bullies, as well as that silent minority who either looked down or me or simply wasn't aware of my existence, now has a much more rewarding life than I do... at times it kills me that I still think of them, while I am sure none of them ever think of me.\n\nAs I approach my 65th birthday I cannot help but imagine how life *could* have been... had I not be, well, *me*. But I am me. Shy, insecure, introverted me. Useless me, who, even at his most sociable and daring, never did well enough to leave a lasting impression, forge a lasting, meaningful relationship or friendship. \n\nI sometimes look up my old batch mates and I see what their lives are like. They go fishing with their grandsons. They sit beside lakes with their wives and husbands balancing wine glasses in their hands. They age gracefully, beautiful white hair glistening in the sun, they visit Italy with their partners, get their picture taken amid Greek ruins and ancient building sites. They enjoy their golden years while I never even had a single golden second.", "subreddit": "ForeverAlone"}

Life has been very lonely over the past 6-7 years. I am an international student in the US. Grew up in a society in which people didnt really care about you and treated you like dirt unless you had a certain name for yourself or had a bunch of money. \n\nAfter having moved to the US, I made it my life`s purpose to make a name for myself, which i did, not to feel cocky but to be accepted in my society. Ambition was, has been life. Awards, scholarships, fame, everything. People back home now `respect` me but this ambition has come at a cost. In the process of making something out of myself, i never gave anybody any time here in the US. \n\nOne of the most popular guys in the city but got no real friends. Everyone knows me, but nobody KNOWS me. People look at my public life and think I have it all when in reality, it is faaar from it. Everyone else, who has not done 5-10% of the work I have, seems to be happy and satisfied and content. All these awards and accolades seem to mean nothing. I look at my wall, full of stuff about ME. And not a single group photo or photos with other friends. \n\nThe ones who ARE my real friends seem to be married or are in a relationship. The ones that are single have a gang on friends who always do stuff together. And all i do is work my ass off, keep hustling, hit the gym and back again. \n\nLife has gotten so busy that I cant turn back now. Making decent money but I HAVE to be on the grind because I have to support my parents and my sister back home, gotta have this `tunnel vision` that people speak of, but I only continue to feel lonely. VERY. It has been over 5 or 6 years now, dont even have people to talk to as i cant relate to them and they cant relate to me.\n\nHoping that I can make some friends on Reddit, planning on joining r/penpals and stuff.

Partly because I\u2019ve moved around so much when I was young but also because of my life style and attachment issues.\nI have a lot of friends who I could talk about sensitive and personal stuff but I felt like I didn\u2019t belong to anywhere and felt alone all the time. I was also never in a relationship so I always struggled with having the anchor point that kept me to the ground. I always feel like I\u2019m floating aimlessly, always looking for new people and new places. \n\nI thought that I made some really close and true friends over the past three years of my college life, and I\u2019m entering my senior year soon. I had this group of friends that I met in freshman year for some and some I got close to this year. I would always come over and hang out at their place (I basically half lived there) and we talked about  living together next year. They were kind of the group of friends that I thought maybe I could depend on. But I did feel often left out and not in sync sometimes but I thought it wasn\u2019t really a big deal. Today they told me that they don\u2019t want to live with me next year. They said they were worried that living together might ruin our friendship since our life style is too different. They kept emphasizing that they still want to be my friend but living together might not be the best idea since they think we are gonna fight over our different life style and they want to \u201csave the friendship\u201d. They mentioned stuff like cleaning, cooking and schedules. But like... these are things that can be easily fixed over communication.\n\nI mean I live kind of a \u201cdifferent life style\u201d meaning I work A LOT. I prioritize my work before anything else and often use that as an \u201cexcuse\u201d to avoid social things etc. I currently have a summer internship and I\u2019ve been working more than 50 hours on an average every week (I worked 67 hours once) and also work on stuff during the weekend. I know that my style is not healthy and I obviously don\u2019t want to live like this forever but I\u2019m kind of addicted to working because I desperately want to succeed, and I\u2019m always paranoid about making a living and leading a life. It\u2019s also my coping mechanism to loneliness. I feel like the college years are the time when I\u2019ll get to put my all in and do my best. And my friends are more like normal students where they want to go out drinking in weekends and \u201cenjoy\u201d their life. I don\u2019t know, maybe I bragged too much about working too hard around them and they felt uncomfortable about it. I think it\u2019s also money situation. My family and I are economically struggling at this point - we are not poor, but me attending this uni rn is a huge toll on my family because how expensive the tuition is, and my parents are sacrificing so much to keep me in school, which is why I feel more pressured to work crazy. And they are more.... comfortable. They are not really worried about jobs or money particularly. I mean they do obviously but not as desperately me. They often exclude me for outings because I don\u2019t like spending money, such as going to clubs or bars. And I don\u2019t have time and energy to do those stuff anyway. They love drinking and going out, and they tend to go to expensive restaurants that I can only afford occasionally. So I usually just come over instead of joining their outings. But I loved co-existing in their space, and just being together. I wanted to have close people around me because I feel so lonely when I\u2019m home. I thought maybe if I live with them I could feel at home. \n\nI understand their perspective on this situation and I can\u2019t argue against people not wanting to live with me but I just feel really alone and left out since they excluded me out of all the friend group just because we have a \u201cdifferent life style\u201d. I think they just don\u2019t think I\u2019m important enough to risk having some differences, and just want to have the \u201cgood part\u201d of the relationship and keep the distance of convenience. \nI don\u2019t know, I\u2019m just really surprised and bummed out since I thought my living situation for next year was sorted out and now I have to find a roommate within a month. I live in New York so it\u2019s extremely hard to find an apartment, and now it\u2019s gonna be harder because I don\u2019t even have a roommate. And they decided to tell me a month before my lease ends.. they offered me to stay in their apt for a month since their lease ends in August so worst case scenario I can just do that. I don\u2019t know.. it\u2019s not like this \u201cruined\u201d our friendship but it made realize maybe there was no friendship to ruin in the first place. Maybe they just kept me around because I\u2019m convenient. Yeah we are friends but I\u2019m not that important. They kept emphasizing how much they like me, which is why they don\u2019t want to live with me since they want to protect the relationship and how we are still gonna hang out and have fun together etc. \nBut it just sounds like they just don\u2019t value me. I\u2019m just some fun clown they want to call in to have fun. I thought we\u2019ve built strong connections and relationships where I trusted them enough that I talked about my childhood and other personal issues like anxiety etc. \nI don\u2019t need people just to hang out. I have enough of those people to be honest (not trying to be a douche) I just thought these were gonna be friends who will be there for me but I guess I was wrong... I have so many \u201cfriends\u201d but don\u2019t have anyone that truly cares about me. I guess it\u2019s on me and my messed up attachment issues - I just push people away and keep my distance and still want to have deep connection with someone.

I just want to be loved, but I feel like my appearance as well as the issues I have will prevent me from being loved forever. I only ever wanted somebody to love and care for, to write and sing songs for while I play guitar or piano or something for them. Somebody I can write poems for and do whatever I can for. It also doesn't help that I'm a goddamn sissy. I'm not a man and never will be. I mean, fucking poems and music? What a load of shit. I could never be anything close to a man. I'm just a goddamn teenage sissy pretending to be a man. I don't know. \n\nAnyways, the loneliness has gotten worse and worse over the past few months. It's made going to sleep quite the task. It also make it hard to look at other couples, even harder than it's already been. Hell, just looking at girls fucks with my mind. I don't get it. Is it simply that I'm unlovable? Am I simply not good enough? Is it my overly sensitive nature? Is it the way I speak or walk or think or something? Is it some deep rooted issue within my mind? Of course lack of confidence takes a toll on my appeal, but I've seen people who hate themselves meet somebody that loves them, so surely it's more than that. I just don't get it. I don't get what I'm doing wrong. Perhaps I'm too antisocial from my near crippling anxiety? I just don't know. \n\nOn top of the loneliness and lack of companionship, I keep worrying about my future. I always feel like I'll never properly adjust to adult life. That I just won't be able to do what I must to meet ends need for a good job. I want to, or need to, go into trade school. I want to go for something like welding, since it seems decently easy as far as jobs go, and I also want to work on music stuff on the side. I don't think I'd be miserable doing so, I just don't feel like I could do it. That I'd lack the means, or the will, or that it will make me too miserable or something. I don't know. I just fear that I won't ever be able to do it. \n\nTo finish this post off, I want to mention how I also fear that I will never get fulfillment and/or happiness out of life. That this may be all that my life will have to offer. I feel like nothing will make me genuinely happy in life. It's harder to explain, so I'll stop there, but I'm sure some of you will get what I mean.\n\nAnyways, that's it for now. I have to wake up early to go to my big brother's graduation ceremony.

We've been close for at least 2 years now, and theres always been some tension between us, always thought she was pretty. Also recently we have been hanging out with just us two which was new. We were drinking at my friends house the other night, both pretty intoxicated, she was getting close and touchy with me. At this point in life I'm feeling very lonely and it's been a while since I felt like this with a girl. I thought to myself fuck it and kissed her and she was into it. Ended up making out a while, and eventually just fell asleep together(nothing sexual happened). I thought it was a good night, in fact hadn't felt this not lonely in a long time. Woke up before her the next morning and left for work. Talked to her about it the next day, she said she was just drunk and to move past it and said we were fine.

Anyway, I came to the realization today that our predicament can be linked in great part to two causes out of our control: genes &amp; education. The first one is generally well understood. My parents are rather unattractive and had had very little experience before meeting each other. Not only did they get lucky, they also crossed paths in the 1970s. No internet, \"abundance mentality\" was not so wide spread I guess. People were not always looking for a sexier, smarter, more succesful partner around the corner. I am getting lost though, please bear with me. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhat about education? Growing up, I was often told something like this (although in a more subtle way):\n\n\\- keep a low profile\n\n\\- self-praise is no recommendation \n\n\\- avoid the center of attention \n\n\\- don't make a scene\n\n\\- don't be obtrusive\n\n\\- speak when spoken too/when you have something \"relevant\" to contribute\n\nIn short, reservation &amp; conformity were equated with good manners. I guess I have internalized a lot of that. I used to have a womanizer friend and the differences I observed in his home went far beyond the introvert vs extrovert contrast. Basically, he was instilled the following beliefs:\n\n\\- Go after your desires \n\n\\- Don't listen to the nay-sayers\n\n\\- You are destined to play an important role in society\n\n\\- You can achieve anything you want to / faith can move mountains\n\n\\- A stranger is a friend you haven't met yet \n\n\\- Stand up for what you think is right. \n\nEtc. etc. I think it's clear which attitude is more conducive to a happy love life. Especially when you're a man and you ALWAYS, always have to take the initiative. This is obviously no consolation. I also know a lot of people with similar upbringings and personalities who aren't a FA. But for what it's worth - keep in mind that it's not 100% fault.

I guess I have excuses -- shitty parents, bullied as a kid, and so on. He did everything right and still wound up FA. The whole thing is just so weird.
