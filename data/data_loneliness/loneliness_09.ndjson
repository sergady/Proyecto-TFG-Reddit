But since I was forced to be around people for so many hours a day, I had almost no desire to hang out with them in my free time and mostly declined invitations to events. This made it seem like I was a bit of a social outcast then. Now though, I have to spend many hours a day studying alone, so when I do have some time on my hands, I find myself actively wanting to be around people. This means I go to more events and spend more time on \"high-quality\" socialising. I therefore meet more friends of friends etc. (instead of just a small circle of close friends) making for a much more outwardly \"normal\" social life. Interestingly, this is even though I spend considerably more time per day alone.\n\nHas anyone else experienced a change like that?", "subreddit": "ForeverAlone"}

Typical FA experience. 28 and no girlfriend ever, never kissed, etc, etc. \n\nI left home at 19 for university, then never left the city I ended up in. During university I never really fit into the culture of the other students. I never went out clubbing and only drank once or twice. It wasn't until I graduated at 22 and went into industry as a software developer that I made friends with a few people from work. Occasionally we'd go to the pub after work or during our lunch hour. \n\nI found out one of my friends from that job occasionally smoked weed and I was able to try it one evening at his place. Weed's one of those things that seems fairly hyped, so it was quite exciting to try it. But of all the things I'd heard, basically nothing happened. Really the most interesting thing is that I knew what it actually smelt like and was suddenly able to notice the odour when walking about town. \n\nEarlier this year, I switched jobs and now found myself working with two guys who are stoners, one of which is my manager. The business I now work in offers a fund for conferences and educational stuff. I asked about a conference in Amsterdam, and really the only word my manager needed to hear to say yes was \"Amsterdam\". \n\nThis was the first time I'd left my home of The Democratic People's Republic of Brexitland. I'd only ever been on a plane once before, and that was when I was seven and don't remember anything about it or that holiday.\n\nThe first night in Amsterdam we went out to one of the coffeeshops. My manager bought a fair amount of weed for himself and got me a preroll made of tobacco and weed. I ended up smoking half of it that night. Bear in mind that I don't smoke at all normally, I've only ever smoked a single cigarette and then only in two sessions as it was too much to do all in once. \n\nThis was my second time trying weed, and this time something happened. I ended up almost immediately getting a drunk like feeling. When I'm drinking, everything becomes hilarious and that's what happened on weed. But there were none of the downsides of drinking.\n\nI went back to the hotel fairly soon after, then the conference the next day.\n\nThe second night though, we again went to the coffeeshops. This time we went to one with a separate smoking area. It was so hazy in there; I was probably getting something merely from the second-hand smoke. Obviously, my tolerance for CBD, THC and tobacco are basically zero. I ended up finishing my joint there.\n\nAgain, there was the same effect as before, but this time I ended up in a very reflective mood. This is also something that happens when I drink. Except unlike when I drink, I ended up feeling happy and hopeful. I thought about how I could divide parts of my life up into eras and see the clear differences and development between then. There was when I was at uni, then when I was at my first job, then this second job, and then the future. I thought about how when I was at uni, going out drinking was something I never thought I would do. But at my first job, that was something I did. How nervous I was taking the train up north for the first time, but how easy it was after a few trips. And now at my second job, I was in a foreign country smoking weed with someone I'd only known for about five months.\n\nFor a brief moment, I thought about the future. That if I could change so much in those years, what could change between now and five years from now. I thought maybe I'd be in a relationship, maybe I'd be happy. For a brief moment, I was hopeful. Genuinely hopeful. \n\nI've always had this sort of \"never say never\" thought about relationships. Being a developer, there's very few women in our industry. But meeting someone is still theoretically possible, and theoretically she could have an interest in me, and theoretically I could believe it was genuine and not just dismiss her as wanting money or attention or something. But all this is very unlikely of course.\n\nBut while high on weed, it seemed likely. Almost probable. That maybe in a few years I'd have a partner that I'd truly love and adore, and that she'd feel the same back. That I could be happy. And that gave me hope, if only for a brief moment.\n\nEventually it wore off though and now I'm back to my regular depressed self. \n\nI think I'll probably do it again with my stoner work friends. Maybe something will change, or maybe I'll just be able to feel that illusion again.", "subreddit": "ForeverAlone"}

Just know that I\u2019m 23, in college (I know it\u2019s late but it\u2019s a long story) and thoroughly FA. In a nutshell, for a variety of reasons I\u2019ve found myself unable to have crushes for the past two or three years. Deep inside, I felt I had no right to have them (or to even be attracted to people). This was quite unique, as I\u2019d complain about loneliness and all the things we know about. I\u2019d yearn for affection, love and personal connections while not having a single person to direct this to.  Meanwhile my mental health deteriorated and the only reason I wasn\u2019t really diagnosed with depression was that I couldn\u2019t get myself to open up to my therapist (who indeed helped me with some of the specific issues I had; I can\u2019t speak for most people).\n\nLast month I finally started working. I managed to get a great internship with very good pay and high probability of being hired when I graduate. That helped my mental health improve a lot. I felt welcomed by my peers in work and school (I got to a point on my college experience in which I finally had classes with some friends for the first time, which made me happy I was in class) and I finally managed to get rid of the mentality that attraction had no legitimacy. August 2019, in particular its last fortnight, was my best month in years, maybe since early 2015.\n\nIn that steaming pot of hopefulness and optimism I of course managed to get attracted to someone: a girl from another major from a course I\u2019m taking who seemed cool. The fact that this wasn\u2019t some \u201cfirst sight\u201d thing but something that evolved after weeks of small talk and collaboration (it\u2019s a collaborative class) makes me think this wasn\u2019t artificial, but anyway. We were sort of getting along. It turns out we have a handful of friends in common, and I\u2019ve told one of them about it, who even gave me a few tips and all (she even thought the kind of dorky way I was handling it was \u201csweet\u201d or \u201ccute\u201d \u2013 my native language isn\u2019t English \u2013 if that changes something).\n\nYesterday I went to this big college party that is more like a club. I stayed with my friends, she stayed with hers. We only said \u2018hi\u2019 to each other \u2013 I think she looked for where I was when she saw our group, but thinking this matters at all would just be confirmation bias. This is to be expected. We\u2019re nothing more than acquaintances.\n\nThat entire party environment also fueled that feeling of lack of belonging. I wasn\u2019t supposed to be there. I didn\u2019t enjoy it. I don\u2019t know a third the number of people my friends know. It made me feel like shit. I\u2019m still the same loser I was a month ago. I\u2019m still ugly, can\u2019t hold an interesting conversation and shit my pants when talking to women I\u2019m not close with. Hope or optimism will never change that.

School for them begins Tuesday. They are having fun on the last weekend of the Summer. While I gave up years ago, seeing couples in their late teens gets to me. When I was in high school people I knew had significant others. They told me they would go out with them to dinner. I'm sure some went on walks together. These kids are having fun together. While their relationship may not last, they are experiencing love.\n\nWhen I was their age, I was unattractive. The guys were mostly taller and more attractive. I think being socially isolated my senior year of high school damaged me more than most people think. That was the last year of high school. It was my last chance to make friends and have my first girlfriend. Instead I spent it either being bullied at school for being ugly and autistic or at home playing video games. Girls in my grade wanted no part of a guy who is at the bottom of the social ladder. Also the ugly thing was a problem. Summer was my break from it. I spent my Summers in high school socially isolated because those kids didn't like me. There was nobody to go out with. I sat at home playing video games or going on the early 2000's internet. I never got to experience a magic moment as a kid.\n\nI still think if I got to experience that for one Summer, I would have turned out differently. Before my senior year, I spent The Summer trying to avoid interacting with other kids my age.

{"post_id": "cyq8a4", "created_utc": 1567437230, "title": "A Chilean FA had a crush on his German friend (comments from Germans or other Europeans will be highly appreciated)", "author": "Kondijote", "self_text": "I'm a 26 year-old man from Chile, about to turn 27. Apart from being short (162 cm or 5'3.7\") and having a flabby fat body, I have really poor social skills due to my social anxiety. I've never had any kind of romantic or sexual interaction with a woman. Both of my parents were agnostic, so I didn't grew up with significant taboos around sex. But my mother was similar to the stereotypical East Asian \u201ctiger mom\u201d regarding my upbringing and education. She always told me that I should only care about my studies, not girls. I guess that could have influenced my way of being. \n\nI have a 25 year-old friend from Northwestern Germany who I met two years ago, when she came to study for a master's degree in my city. Let's call her \u201cAnja\u201d. She rented a room in my apartment (where I live with my mom) for more than a month after she found another place closer to her university. When I told one of my friends about her, he said that this was an opportunity to lose my virginity because \u201cgringas\u201d have a lax attitude to sex. But in my first conversation with Anja, the topic of religion suddenly came up, and she told me she was a Lutheran, so I supposed she would be more conservative than other Germans. But later I would realize that wasn't the case. \n\nDuring my interactions with her, I was very clumsy and had problems initiating and keeping conversations. I'm generally like that with most girls, but with her was specially intense since she comes from a different culture, and I was afraid of her reaction if I did something wrong. It didn't help that she's also somewhat introverted. I started to read about Germans and German culture on the internet. I learnt that Germans were much more reserved than Latin Americans, and she fits that description. I read that German women were highly interested in politics, but she is not as knowledgeable about that topic as I would have expected. I also found out that Germans were not fond of small talk, which made me even more anxious when talking to her. \n\nI was really attracted to Anja. She's skinny, pale, blonde, blue-eyed and a few centimeters taller than me at 165 cm (5'5\"). She takes care of herself by eating a vegetarian diet. But it wasn't only sexual attraction. Each time I spent with her, even if we just walked together without exchanging any word, I started to feel emotionally attached to her. That's why I got jealous when in a club, where we went along with two guys who we met the very same day (let's call them Tom and John, both 10 years older than her), out of the blue John started to kiss her on the neck. Since it was so unexpected, I thought she would react by slapping him on the face, but she let him continue. I didn't act upon my jealousy though.\n\nIn October 2017, Anja packed her bags to go to another place. Before she left my apartment, we went to my room and I told her that I have social anxiety and that I was thankful for meeting her. *\"You're confident, you like to take risks... You made me change the way I view things\"* I said. Her eyes were shaking as if she were about to cry, which took me by surprise since I was used to her German poker face. We hugged each other. Later, she asked me to help her take some of her bags to the ground floor.\n\nWe didn't lose contact. A couple of weeks later, Anja organized a surprise party for my 25th birthday. She invited Tom, John and Clara, another German woman who's taking up the same master's degree. In December, she invited me to a vegetarian BBQ at her new place. While there, I saw her making out with Tom, so I assumed they were dating. I felt uncomfortable but I just pretended not to care. Tom is a Chilean of German-descent, tall, broad-shouldered and athletic. He's also quite extraverted and has a broad circle of friends and acquaintances. Some days later, I texted Anja that I saw her \u201cboyfriend\u201d in downtown, but she replied that he wasn't actually her boyfriend. This further confirmed that she's as sexually liberal as any German. \n\nMy mom told me that once she and Anja were watching a Spanish TV series about high school kids on Netflix. In one scene, a guy was very nervously talking to a girl he was attracted to. Anja started to laugh and said that all guys acted like this when they were attracted to her. She said *\"That's why I prefer experienced men!\"*. \n\nLast year, Anja went back to Germany to continue the 2nd and 3rd semesters of her master's degree. This year she's back in Chile to finish her thesis. She has visited us several times, and it's clear that she appreciates us as much as we appreciate her. She even said that we're her \u201cChilean family\u201d. When she comes to our apartment, she makes cakes with healthy ingredients, and has spent some nights here. I took a basic German course at my university, so sometimes we exchange basic phrases in German. Lately, we've been watching movies and series such as Grave of the Fireflies, the German movie \u201cPaula\u201d, and Outlander. \n\nA couple of days ago, I went to a fair in which she had a stand offering sweets made with low-calorie ingredients. She was representing an organization created by two other friends she has. I got jealous of how the other guys interacted with her. She seems to enjoy the company of more extraverted Chileans. Sometimes I wonder if she would have been attracted to me if I had better social skills. Or she would have rejected me anyways due to my physical shortcomings? Do I still have chances with her? How she would react if I confess my deepest feelings?\n\n**\u2022 TLDR:** I (26M) had a crush on my German friend (25F) who I met two years ago, when she came to rent a room in my apartment for a month. She's studying for a master's degree in my city. I have social anxiety, so I behave clumsy when interacting with her. I ended up being sexually attracted and emotionally attached to her. I got jealous when I saw other guys making sexual advances on her (although I didn't act upon my jealousy). When she packed her bags to rent in another place closer to her university, I revealed to her that I have social anxiety. Last year she went back to Germany to continue the 2nd and 3rd semesters of her master's degree, but this year she's back in Chile to finish her thesis.", "subreddit": "ForeverAlone"}

Maybe it does make me selfish, idk. I'm at work rn as i'm writing this, and i work the drive through, and i have this regular and i really like him because he's pleasant and really nice and i already know his order, sometimes he won't even order at the microphone, he'll just pull up and smile and he knows that i already know his order so i just put in and i don't even bother to tell him his total cause he already knows the price, point is him and i have grown fond of eachother. i was waiting for him to come by to get his usual, cause i really needed to see a friendly face, i wasn't feeling emotionally well and was hoping for him to cheer me up a little, but he didn't come today, which is really weird because he literally comes everyday, i was so certain he was going to come. but he didn't. oh well. sometimes what we need the most isn't available. instead, i got all the regulars who hate me. w.e. i've been making memes lately that are SUPER morbid and specific, but it's kinda helped, it's almost like making memes can help vent and express what i want, and how i want to. so i recommend making memes to anyone reading this if you're feeling lonely or sad, you may not be good at it at first, they might not be funny or you may not have an initial idea of how to go about it, but just try it, it can be fun and it's kinda helping me. if you're curious about the memes i made check out my profile but they're pretty extra haha. another question: does anybody love the smell of cigarettes the way i do? idk what is about the smell, but it makes me feel warm and cozy and kinda comforts me, but i have no idea why. i'm weird.\n\ntldr; i still feel lonely, even when i'm around other people and i like making memes about my issues, it makes me feel a tiny bit better and i like the smell of cigarettes.", "subreddit": "lonely"}

I need some sort of romantic and sexual fulfillment that I'm just not getting. I've been single for most of my life and it's really taken a serious toll on my self esteem. I have a good amount of loving friends that I care about so much, but I don't feel like any of them fully understand what I'm going through, and that makes me afraid to reach out to them when I'm not doing well.\n\nEvery person I've ever had feelings for has rejected me. Most of them have chosen other, better-looking people over me. The few relationships I've been in haven't lasted for more than a few weeks, and haven't been even remotely met my emotional or physical needs. I don't feel like I've ever been anyone's first choice, and I honestly don't even know what to fucking do any more. It's so hard to watch most of my friends and most of the people I've been interested in in loving relationships and just not have anything. I've been making such an effort to be as productive as I can and improve myself. I lost 10 pounds over the summer and started lifting weights most days of the week, but ever since I've come back for my senior year of college I've just felt so miserable. Last night I woke up in the midst of a fucking panic attack over this shit and haven't been able to think straight all day.\n\nAny time I try to open up to someone the advice I'm given usually boils down to \"learn to be happy on your own\", but I just don't see how to do that. I've been through rejection after rejection since I was in middle school and feel so worthless because of it. I don't think I'm ever going to be in a position to feel complete or happy with myself until I can feel like I'm worth being someone's first choice.\n\nAny time I try to meet new people it's met with radio silence. I've been using Tinder for over a year and haven't gotten a single date. I just don't think I'm photogenic or attractive enough for this sort of app. On the rare occasion that I do get a match the conversation usually devolves into me getting left with a \"haha lol\" or being ghosted. In the past day I've gotten like 5 matches that immediately unmatched with me before I could even write out something to say. The most likes I've ever been notified of have been 6... am I really only worth *6 people* on the entire planet thinking I'm potentially worth talking to??\n\nI'm decently involved on campus in club activities, student government, and volunteer work, but none of those have ever lead to me meeting anybody. It just feels so painful and thankless to host an event and walk away from it feeling even more isolated than I already was.\n\nI really don't know what to do at this point. Even now this post is probably just going to be met with \"that's rough :(\". The counseling center on campus is pretty terrible, I'm afraid that if I go there and manage to open up to someone I'll just be told to \"try turning off stress-mode and just learn to enjoy yourself\" or some equally unproductive shit.

Some part of me knew the truth, but on a conscious level I was genuinely convinced that I had a chance. But we all know that in this vile shithole of a world, nothing can \\*ever\\* truly be wonderful.\n\nAs for how I got here: I started going to a new watering hole 3 months ago. One of the first few times, this drunk chick comes in. Out of nowhere she comes up to me and starts grinding on me, like hardcore, after making suggestive comments. That was the first thing remotely sexual to ever happen to me and I was flabbergasted.\n\nSo in hopes of seeing her again I keep coming back to this place. Turns out she works there. She doesn't say much of anything to me while at work...until 7 weeks ago. She comes in again on her night off, and after initially ignoring me comes up once again and kisses me on the lips (my first kiss ever), and grinds on me again. For the following several weeks she again behaves as if nothing happened (I actually posted about these incidents here on an alt back when it happened, idiotically telling people \"if I can escape so can you\").\n\nThe period in this window was among the greatest times of my life, with that night undoubtedly being in the top 3 days. I had not felt this kind of pure, genuine happiness and optimism since I was a child. My entire adult life has, with few exceptions, resembled a zombie-like state devoid of enjoyment and it appeared that I had finally broken away from this cage. But that more experienced, realistic part of me knew that there would come an end -- that I would have to pay the piper, and that time was coming sooner rather than later.\n\nThen last night happened. Seven weeks to the day from my special night. She comes in on a night off, completely ignores me and almost everyone else except some old biker dude (like 60/70-something) that she proceeds to rub and drool all over. On the way home I considered crashing my car into the side of a building and just fucking ending it. I had a dream where we got together, and then woke up today to the worst morning of my entire life.\n\nThis also gave evidence for a suspicion that I had tried very hard to bury deep into the recesses of my mind -- that those first two nights meant absolutely nothing. Much like my life in general that, if I found out was going to end soon, would not phase me in the least. Because I'm back in the shit pit, and barring a miracle will never escape.\n\nThanks for reading, I don't have anyone I can talk to in real life about this.", "subreddit": "ForeverAlone"}

My family has something with depression but they never show it. Both of my grandparents have different ways of showing it. One worked there ways up after immigrating here and now lives near a beach. The other ones are in the hood and are stuck there. My parents barely show it and I'm the only one in my family that shows it. Me and my family moved 3 different states before finding a place to stay. Elementary School was a mess and I'm still questioning why I graduated. And middle school was worse. I both juuled and smoked pot to help cope with it, but they did absolutely nothing. I also had a lot of people to \"help me\" and telling me that \"everything is going to be alright\" which is hasn't and the only people that have really helped me was my phycologist, my therapest, my English teacher and my parents but I've just lied to all of them telling myself I was fine when really I wasn't. I just needed help and my friend who I'm going to call liv was a person who was in the same boat as me. I met her though my friend Liam and I told her all my problems and she would help. But ever since she hanged out with her boyfriend more, she just stopped talking to me and idk why. I told her one day that I was crying and all she could say was \"all your other friends can help you\" which to me, said that she didn't want to talk anymore. Even when I'm around friends I always wanted to just walk away because I know that I have no talent to bring to the table. I ditched my other friends and now I am just alone and empty. But if I were to post a picture of me upset or tell them I was crying they would either try to comfort me and instead fed me to my emotions or not even respond or the worst: asking if... U GOOD? Like no I'm not good I just had an emotional breakdown but thanks for asking im just gonna keep crying and lie to you while you have the time of your life. I went to London and that was the only cool part of my summer and the rest was dogshit except for visiting my grandparents. I just stayed by myself playing GTA online and black opps 4. I've been crying in my bed at 12-3 am listening to Frank Sinatra and other sad songs. I can really connect with nature and the ocean because it helps calm me down. I'm not even attractive but I guess there is one girl that I talked to that apreaciates me for who I am and I think also for my looks. We would have some cute moments together but she's been no help either and same thing happened to my other friend: we just stopped talking and idk why. She always talked about a boyfriend which for me, I knew that I was the side chick and I don't know how to feel about this. I'm just in a empty place and just can't wait for high school to end. None of my friends help me, I keep lying to the people who want to help me and the people I trust I can't trust anymore.

I've had a tough highschool, with people bullying me and ignoring me, and it really took a toll on me. Even though I started to study more and started having better grades, I think that left me a bit scared and never healed completely. I've taken the same lifestyle throughout medicine, but I've actually made some friends and acquaintances. As time went by, I started to loose these connections and held on to this group of friends that I thought cared about me, but realized that they would cancel plans on me a lot, not invite me to stuff unless I invited myself, would exclude me.. I felt humiliated and a weirdo. I then got a boyfriend who was schizophrenic and had a lot of issues and kept breaking up with me and it shattered me. All my \"friends\" started to get away from me cause they couldn't handle being there for me, cause I was so low after the breakup. And I felt really heartbroken, cause it all came in once. I spent all my days alone, I had no one to talk to, and I was going crazy and was very depressed for months. I've done everything I possibly could to salvage this relationship but I still couldn't do it. I eventually met my current and amazing boyfriend on tinder and it's been quite amazing on that aspect. It's been over a year, but I still feel very lonely. I feel I've grown a lot, changed a lot, and got happier but I'm stuck in the same social situations for the last year and I can't get out. I keep seeing the same people and feel like a disaster for not having made any friends in these 6 years or in highschool. I only have like 2 close friends that live far away, cause the rest I kept losing over the years, no matter how hard I tried to keep them.\nI feel very lonely and I think I'm gonna move soon and start over. But in the meantime if anyone wants to talk it would be amazing! I don't know how else to meet new people and it drives me crazy and all this time spent alone makes me feel very depressed sometimes. \nI'm sure there's some other people that feel the same way but are too scared or embarrassed to speak out. \nI admit it, it's difficult", "subreddit": "lonely"}

First I was the only one in my friend group to go to a different high school so my friends that lived near me got closer while I was left out and it got to the point where they\u2019d wonder where I was but then never invite me out. And the kids at my high school all lived an hour away so I never saw them outside of school and wasn\u2019t able to get close to them.\n\nThat\u2019s when I realized that I had to make my own fun so I\u2019d spend 12 hr a day at school hanging out with teachers and going to any and all sporting events even if I was the only one there for a JV girls soccer game, at least those kids felt they had a fan and hopefully wouldn\u2019t feel so lonely. \n\nAfter making it through high school I went off to college knowing nobody else at the school, something I thought was good for me, being a fresh face out of 15k kids. I met some good friends but then they all rushed frats and sororities while I focused on school tearing our friendship apart yet again. Then I made some really good friends I would hang out with a bunch, academic friends and partying friends. Then I even met a girl I really liked and thought she liked me too but I was too nervous to do anything about it so when my formal came around I asked a different girl I liked to go with me and she said yes. Only to get snapchats from her the night before in my friends bed and then snapchats of the Condom in the bed the next morning. \n\nAfter that I really relied on my friends and they helped me through it but then I transferred to my dream school and had to leave all of them and the girl I never got enough courage to ask out behind. \n\nNow I\u2019m at my dream school and every night I just feel lonelier and lonelier. I talk to the girl from my old school all the time and it kills me that she did like me too and would be my girlfriend if I didn\u2019t transfer. So I asked her if she would be my date to our biggest dance here and she\u2019s gonna be out of the country. \n\nSo for spring break I went back to my old college and had fun and all but it wasn\u2019t the same because they can\u2019t relate what I go through at my new school and I\u2019m not with them anymore so I become just a distant memory.\n\nDon\u2019t get me wrong. I\u2019m 100% sure I made the right choice to come to this school it\u2019s just that nights like these where I miss all of the few true friends I\u2019ve made in my 20yr. \n\nPS I\u2019ve found ways to feel important and involved by helping friends here with their relationship problems because I know I\u2019ll never have a girlfriend anytime soon so it helps but also makes me feel even lonelier at times.\n\nAny tips and recommendations would be great!\n\nThanks for listening to me vent!!", "subreddit": "lonely"}

No one else has posted anything similar as far as I know so I may actually be truly alone in this.\n\nI've had friends before with all genders. Most of those friendships were online but some were not. Most of my friends were men. My longest friendships were with men and all the friendships I had with ladies didn't last long for reasons I'll mention later. I feel it's easier for me to have more things in common and connect more with men than women.\n\nI'm straight and I'm not after a relationship with anyone and that has caused problems when it comes to the friend search. When I say I'm looking for a friend I'm looking for only that, not low key looking for a relationship or friends with benefits. When I claim anywhere online I'm looking for friends I mainly get responses from men which isn't the issue. The problem is once you make it clear that you're only after friends and the chance of anything more or sexual isn't going to happen they're just gone. I understand that the desire for romance and sex is common and normal but it feels very isolating when you only want a friend. I just want someone that genuinely likes me and enjoys my company and would be fine if our relationship progresses or stays the same. Usually if I have any friends it's just one and I don't feel comfortable dating my only friend. It's seems extremely risky and irrational to risk the only friendship you have hoping the same compatibilities you have as friends will transfer into a relationship and remain stable. Like what if you break up? Who are you going to turn to if you have nobody else? Things usually aren't the same when you break up with someone and even if you remain in contact with the person  things may not even go back to being to same as when you were just friends. Being friends with guys already in a relationship is unnerving to me. I had friends get married and I never hear from them again after that and I had friends drop me because they had a partner that didn't want them to have female friends because they see them as a threat. I know that shouldn't bother me but I had a lot of friendships end after they enter a relationship even when no one expressed the slightest romantic interest in the other.\n\nWhen I try befriending ladies they often don't really seem interested in talking. I've had 3 friendships with ladies and unfortunately our relationship either devolved into them only coming to me for advice about their problems, not taking the advice given and returning for more advice that won't be taken or suddenly disappearing for a while only to return with no explanation and the friendship reverts to just small talk and dies.\n\nIt feels so isolating to be on subreddits for lonely or forever alone people when you're not after sex or low key a romantic relationship. I'm a virgin and frankly I can do with or without sex. I know not wanting sex before marriage is underrated and will most likely keep me single for a long time or forever and I accept that. I don't do one night stands or into being required to have sex with someone just because I'm dating them. I see a bit more value in waiting until marriage to have sex but I know a lot of people look down on that or don't hold that sentiment. Guys say women will always be in demand and that's true but they aren't in demand just for platonic reasons only.\n\nI am no longer looking for friends online and I'm tired of living in a metropolitan area. I want to move somewhere rural or suburban to hopefully be around more seemingly friendly people when I can afford to but after that I don't know what to do. I'm not saying my situation is completely hopeless but I do recognize it as a problem that may go unsolved until some sort of technological advancement if you get what I mean.\n\nI don't know if anyone agrees or if this is just gonna remain unread due to length or downvoted to hell but I wanted to share my experience when it comes to trying to make friends.", "subreddit": "lonely"}

This girl is the first person either of us loved. It sucks.\n\nI don't want anything crazy to come from this post. I just want to know that there are a few others. Other people who feel like a weight on other's shoulders. Other people who feel like people pity them for no reason. Other people who feel like the universe is laughing at them, because I feel like I don't have anybody else with me to tackle these issues. I feel like nobody should have to help me tackle these. However, as you can tell, I caved in, and now I'm asking random strangers in an online chat for advice about love triangles. Just tell me what you think, maybe some advice, maybe some of your personal stories. I just want to know that there are others. I feel alone.", "subreddit": "ForeverAlone"}

I really like living here. People are genuinely nice and all of that. \n\nHowever, there is one thing that you realise after you live in another country for a while...

This is just the way things are, and I accept that. I'm not entitled to people liking me, so that's fine. \n\nHowever, as much I'd like to I got used to it... I don't think I have, to be honest.

We were so alike, he really seemed like a real option for a long term relationship. I\u2019m talking, almost so right, that I could\u2019ve seen myself making a life with him. \nWe started dating, I was ecstatic, and things were going well until a week went by and he hadn\u2019t even tried to hold my hand. Another week goes by... nothing! We were dating a month and I finally just had to end it. He never once even tried to cross more than the \u201cbrief full hug\u201d line. I am someone who is usually in charge and confident but still a person who wants other people to initiate as well. I resolved a long time ago that I wasn\u2019t the kind of girl who would kiss first, or make the first move... it just isn\u2019t me. (There is sooooooo nothing wrong with unconventional gender roles, I just wanna be true to myself.) \nWhen we first had the DTR talk, he told me he might be slow and awkward about physical affection. I told him we would just get there when we got there, because frankly, I was nervous too. I mean kissing... ITS WEIRD... WHERE DO YOUR TEETH GO? \nAnyway... I never dreamed that so many dates and opportunities would go by in the span of a month and he wouldn\u2019t even try anything. I began wondering if he even wanted to touch me, or even if he did would it be because he felt pressured or obligated to. I would probably never trust his touch anyway... so, cut to me letting him off the hook and ending it. \n\nI feel self aware enough to realize this had nothing to do with me or my desirability. It was all his issue but I had no desire to stick around and wait for him to figure it out. I don\u2019t know much about dating or relationships but I know enough about myself that I want someone who is fully convinced of their attraction to me, not someone I have to beg to touch me. It left me feeling like a brazen hussy, someone who was easy or fast. \n\nAll this to say is that I realized that more than most things I want someone to just want to hold me. I want to feel so connected to someone that we both mutually want to be near and close to each other. I wonder if this is even something that exists? Will there ever be anyone who will want to wrap his arms around me and not rush away out of fear of vulnerability. My parents are not this way... this kind of love was never modeled to me.

I use the scare quotes because I'm currently alone and for all of the times that I've dated or been in a relationship, they have ultimately been failures due to being rooted in my own shitty attitudes, expectations, and behaviors. It's also worth noting that I'm pretty firmly into my middle age at this point and have a bit more of a long view than I did in, say, my early 20's, and I have had a chance to get a few experiences under my belt.  I can't blame you if this already sounds like too much of a humble brag or whatever, though it's not meant as such. I'm looking to process things a bit after a recent failure and after revisiting this forum, I thought some of this might be helpful to others. As with most things in life, YMMV.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy dating life from 16 to 27 was, in short, an unceasing train wreck. The few times that I managed to get a date or become somewhat involved with someone, it fell apart immediately or within a few weeks at most. I spent a solid three years(23-26) without a seeing anyone at all and everything before that was extremely unfulfilling(awkward attempts at sex, rampant clinginess as soon as anyone showed a shred of interest in me, weird \"supportive\" behavior in hopes of backdooring my way into a relationship, and so on.) In two cases, I doormatted myself into being a short term ego boost for a couple of fairly toxic women. I'm well stocked in self-esteem issues, to be sure.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAt 27(2009 for those counting at home), I managed to start something resembling a real relationship via. I liked her. She liked me. It was so \"good\" that we slept together on our first date\u2014d'oh! If nothing else, there was good physical chemistry between us. Me being me though, I latched on this relationship with every ounce of my being. For the first year that we were together, I was on an absolute roller coaster of emotional highs and lows, purely because of my own shit. I lived and died on how long it had been since her last email/text and only ever felt really secure in the relationship when we were spending time together in person. The other shoe was always looming in the shadows, just waiting for an excuse to come crashing down, or that's how it seemed in my head. I did my absolute best to hide all of that from her and was largely successful, I assume, as she didn't pull the plug until a few years later and for very different reasons.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe cure to the roller coaster was to move in together, or that's what I convinced myself of at the time(never mind any of that self actualization BS!) I talked her into getting an apartment after about a year of dating and, surprisingly, it even had the intended effect, as the highs and lows evened out for me. Admittedly, life was actually pretty good for a while, as we sort of drifted from moment to moment and never worried too much about what came next. I was usually quick to jump on board with whatever she wanted to do and things basically worked between us. Based on everything that came before and after this period in my life though, it is hard to look back and not wonder how much of that happiness was simply borne of ignorance.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnd of course that kind of thing only works for so long and eventually the reality of who we are as people meant that things would end. She is very much a free spirit type who likes to be on the move and never stay in one place for very long. I'm much the opposite and tend to want to stay around things that are familiar. Ultimately, at around year 4 of our relationship when an opportunity came up for her that required a substantial move, she took it, basically with no input from me, and subsequently ended things soon after. In the year prior to that, I had become more distant from her, so I don't put the entirety of the blame for her unilateral decision on her. The writing was on the wall, it just took a few years for us both to see it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe aftermath was quite bad for me though, as a lie was basically being paid to everything that I had thought I had wanted prior to dating her. I had been very much been of the mindset that if I could just be in a relationship, then everything wrong in my life would be fixed and it would be bliss forever! Magical thinking, indeed. I was absolutely reeling as the constructs of what I thought I wanted collapsed into the giant hole where she had been in my life. I ran up piles of debt and jumped into my favorite distractions with wild abandon. Video games, T.V., Magic the Gathering, porn, not to mention a bit of booze sprinkled on top. I let my health slide, largely ground the forward progress in my career to a halt, ultimately feeling like nothing particularly mattered.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAbout 18 months later, I snapped out of this a bit when it seemed like a woman that I worked with might be interested in me. Nothing happened between us but it did get me back into a workout routine, eating better and back into the online dating pool. Things didn\u2019t work out particularly well with the online dating though, to the point where I eventually ended up seeing an escort on two different occasions. Of course that was ultimately not fulfilling, particularly the second time where the girl seemed about as interested in me as a piece of wilted lettuce. If there's a lesson here, it's that sex fixes nothing outside of a case of blue balls and there are certainly easier(and cheaper) ways to deal with that. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI did end up eventually dating one person for a few months during this period but she pulled the plug because she felt that I wasn't that into her physically; which hey, fair enough, though I did enjoy spending time with her in general. Given that I felt like I was getting into a pattern of using women and that I ultimately still wasn't really over my ex, I stopped trying to date all together and another 18 months passed, bringing us to the end of 2016.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe next woman in my life entered pretty much by happenstance with no prior planning or intent, as I worked with a friend of hers and she ended up at my company's Christmas party. We talked for a while that night, exchanged numbers, went on a date a week later and ended up in bed by the end of that date\u2014again with the quick intimacy! This relationship ultimately ended up being pretty outside the bounds of anything normal, as it started during the final few months of my father's life and was deeply entwined with those events. Within a few months of his passing, we had basically come to realize that we weren't right for each other, though we continued a physical relationship for much of the next year. We had a pretty good break from each other after that, only texting and an occasional phone call in between but have since renewed our friendship. In a lot of ways that's all still pretty new, as we don't hangout that often and her current boyfriend is something of a factor, but we do seem to be okay with hanging out and having rather open communication.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI don't entirely know what to make of the whole situation with her other than to say that we weren't compatible in some pretty fundamental ways, chief among them being that I'm far too passive and not \"interesting\" enough to maintain a long term relationship with her. Those are my words, not hers, but I think those hit pretty close to the mark when all the chrome is stripped away. That is of course, my problem, not hers, as I'm not owed a relationship with anyone and we can all choose what we want from our partners. In that vein though, one of the biggest problems that I've had is that I'm never really making a choice when it comes to dating, it's always just a desperate scramble to hold on to anyone that comes into my orbit since I feel like it's extreme luck when that happens. Of course, that attitude is self-sabotaging because I'm ultimately predicating a huge part of my self-worth on other people's opinions and moods while ignoring the fact that I'm generally someone that people like to be around. Easy enough to say, but it's entirely something else once a relationship could be at hand and it's been months and years since the last time anyone even gave me the time of day.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnother thing that I struggle with is the idea of being \"good enough\" vs. needing self-improvement so that I'm more desirable. I mean, if I really am good enough then why the fuck am I alone? Conversely, if I do need to improve, what does that actually look like? I've gone down the self-improvement road a few times and become \"better\" and more \"well-rounded\" but it all ultimately felt like I was just putting on a facade that had no basis in reality. What kind of relationship can I really have with someone when I feel like a used car salesman who's put a fresh coat of wax on lemon that's about to dump it's transmission? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTo offer a partial answer to that, I am starting to realize that my self-centeredness is a big part of the problem. Those questions above are, in essence, looking for ways to manipulate someone into being with me or have women be interested in me without putting anything out into the world in the first place. I don't add much to the world that isn't, in someway, meant to directly benefit me in return and I think that ultimately becomes apparent to people that come into my life, and women especially. I'm zero-sum at the best of times and an emotional drain otherwise, bringing little real value to people's lives. Hardly a new thought for me, though this is coming at it from a different angle and not simply falling back to the base \"I'm alone because I suck\" mantra that so often echoes in my skull. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nRecently it looked like something might start up between me and a woman I've known for a long time but it ultimately fizzled out before things got very far due to my past history with her friend, the woman I was most recently seeing before this. Obviously murky waters, though we've all been pretty adult about the whole thing and everyone was well aware of things before hand. At the end of the day that history was too much for her to set aside though and so she called it quits before things got too far along. Probably for the best in a lot of ways since I still feel like I'd be wasting someones time by getting involved with them, and I really don't think I would have been able to keep her interest long term. As it is, I'm doing my best not to read too deep between the lines and think that she already realized that I\u2019m undateable and thus was just being nice about it. I don't think that's the case but my shit brain sure keeps pitching it out there like it might be. (And for all of my positive talk later in this post, this is still basically where I'm at with myself a lot of the time.) Sigh...\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo having made what I thought of as peace(or at least settled in) with my aloneness prior to these last few months, I'm now once again facing the fact that I do actually want to have someone in my life romantically but feel completely powerless to make that happen. About the only answer I have right now is: be a better person. That's pretty nebulous and not much of an actionable plan, not to mention that it seems only tangentially connected(though perhaps part of my problem)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnyway, I appreciate those of you have bothered to read this far, as I fear that this was mostly just more self-serving shit on my part and of little value to people who frequent this forum. I will make an attempt at some \"pearls of wisdom\" though, as I do think some of what I've lived through might be of value to others. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFirstly, I'll say that sex is not the end-all, be-all. While certainly awkward at first, it's something that can be learned and practiced. Having sex with someone doesn't magically bond you with them for life, or fix you, or make you a man/woman/human, or give you a merit badge. It can cover up other problems with how you relate to someone, at least for a while, but at the end of the day, it's only one component in a much larger tapestry that makes up a \"relationship.\" I've \"succeed\" at sex but ultimately failed at much of the rest of it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnd speaking of relationships, I'll add that getting into one with someone also won't fix your life. It might seem like it does for a while, particularly if you are feeling social pressure from other quarters, such as friends and family, but you can't escape yourself by merging your life into someone else's. It just doesn't work that way. If you go into a relationship expecting it to fix everything in your life, you're ultimately going to be hit with some crushing disappointment somewhere down the road. As someone who buried himself in debt after his first big relationship and then subsequently went bankrupt when he lost his job, I can attest to just how crushing it can be.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLastly, I'll add that looks aren't everything. My looks are middling at best and I am currently about 50-60 pounds above my ideal weight and still have some interest being shown in me. Even when I was younger, fitter and more in my \"prime\", the physical stuff didn't matter because it's always came down to my personality and how I presented myself(or usually failed to). Good looks don't hurt, though I do think that they can end up being a mask for a poor personality. On the flip side, I also think they can be a whipping boy for loneliness when they are less conventional. Attraction works on a lot of levels and looks on make up a small part of it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI hope this helps someone out there.", "subreddit": "ForeverAlone"}

I was chronically lonely, depressed, and severely underweight. I used to cry myself to sleep at night almost every single day because I was so lonely and all I ever wanted was a girlfriend, or to even be acknowledged by women. Many hours were spent posting on forums discussing my dating woes, along with emotional vlogs talking about my struggles with talking to girls. At work, a girl once said hi to me and asked me how my day was, and because I was so lonely and deprived of human connection, even a woman simply acknowledging me and making a friendly gesture to me was enough to make my entire week, even though it probably meant nothing to her.   \n\n\nAs a 21 year old, I had hopes that my romantic prospects would get better; I had fantasies of meeting a pretty girl at school where we would hit it off and she would become my girlfriend.

This was my expectation when I were to start college in the fall of 2016.   \n\n\nI am now 24 years old, and after three years of trying to search for any sort of love life, I could not find what I was looking for.  Sure I got better at talking to girls; I learned how to approach women, got to the point of being able to maintain a conversation, I even reached a level of being to ask women out, but to no avail.  I also put myself in a position to meet girls; I signed up for online dating, joined a bunch of clubs, pursued girls in my classes, but I could never get any sort of dating life.  I even started working out fairly regularly, dressing better, began paying attention to my diet, got a decent job for a college student, had my own place, even had a steady group of friends, but none got me a girlfriend.

It was amazing at first, then i found out the hard thruth, i have one friend here whos in college and has to study/gf doesnt really wanna see me that much anyway.\n\nNow apart from that, im trying to find a girl, but the thing is, its either im extremely unlucky or my brain is programmed to pick the ones that are in relationship/just got out of it, which is very fucking painful.\n\n\nI had 3 dates in last couple of months(2 in old city and one few days ago in new one), was pumped for all 3, but they all turned out to be a big fuck you for me lol\n\nFirst one went amazing, we kissed in the end, I was very happy with how it went, i asked her out few days after and she replied with \"im not looking for a serious relationship rn\" I was like what? Tried explaining her that its to early for that but that didnt go well and we stopped talking.\n\nSecond one was with a girl i knew from way back, asked her out and she said ye, went out and on the middle the date she told me that she recently broke up with her boyfriend, and well at that point i knew it was pretty much over, tried to kiss her on the end of the date and she just said \"i cant do this i just left a relationship\", and we just stopped talking.\n\nThird and last one(the one in this beautiful city in which i know fucking nobody)i met her in some sort of social gathering and she seemed cool, we made plans for a date that night. And when date stsrted 5 mins into it she tells me some shit about her BOYFRIEND. Tho she is very friendly and i probably misunderstood her reaction, but basically it fucked me up for the rest of the night and it ended weird. So im guessing we're prpbably just gonna stop talking aswell.\n\n\nEach time i go out same shit happens.

Always to fail spectacularly at keeping contact with these people, just to fall even deeper in my unwillingness to fight on and ever try again. \n\n\nThis time, at least, it was fast. My only friend sends me a message saying that his roommate just broke up and could use some distraction. By chance, I just had some free movie coupons on me, so I invite both of them to a movie. It's nice. I talk to people IRL like this for the first time after more than a year. Next day, we play some games online. It's great. Next weekend, they invite me to their place for lunch. It's awesome. I stay even for dinner. I sharpen their kitchen knives, because that's my thing. First time someone actually took my offer to do it. I am ecstatic. I still have plenty of coupons left, so I start planning another movie night with them and the roommate seems interested in going without my friend and getting to know me better. Could this be it? Maybe, after rotting in my own room/flat alone for the last ten years, I could start finally hanging out with people.\n\nLol, of course not. Immediately after all this, the roommate stops responding to my messages and from my friend I learn she brought home some other guy. And suddenly, I remember all the feelings of worthlessness. Of inadequacy. Of being really just a distraction to people before they find other, better people. It's time to start building my loneliness bubble, that I tore down, once more so I can forget these feelings. I am getting really tired of this happening again and again and again... \n\n\nAnd yes, I still have my friend. It's the only thing keeping me barely afloat. He just isn't a \"hang out\" type of friend. Every second not spent on his computer is a second wasted. Getting him to a movie theater was a miracle on its own.\n\nI am not really trying to get anywhere with this post. I just needed to get this out of me.

I'll try to be short \nI've suffered with depression all my life but never really dealt with it.\n\nTwo years into college I'm actually quite happy despite the few depressive spells that come on rarely.\n\nI've had lost a few years studying a difficult course and failing and was at risk of being feeling very lesser than most people I came in contact with. But it was something I was good at dealing with most of the time.\n\nCome final year in college I go crazy over this girl, she does start liking me back, but she plays it safe by not outright agreeing to a relationship but still being very close friends. This brings me emotional stress and I ended up kind of ghosting her. Looking back it was a bad move, but my mind was all sorts of fucked.\n\nThings with her get better later, but still things weren't working out, we couldn't find time to talk and there was this constant lack of communication, but I would still be there for her when she had issues.\n\nBut it crumbles and we don't talk to each other play jealousy games and then college is over.\nShe gets over it pretty quick and it's almost one year in and I'm still struggling.\n\nSo lately I decide to talk to my friend about it because there was just so much pain and stigma and I wanted to do something about it. And I do feel better, but not sure for how long.\n\nBut I also find out she was lying a lot and was just a pathological liar which made sense and which I was suspicious of. Looking back, I think this was responsible for the emotional stress. And this ofcourse made me very sad about her friends who had to deal with this and covered this up and the others who thinks that she's a genuine person.\n\nNow I do feel better, but I feel very confused as to the person she was, all my time and effort and also I feel like whining about it all the time, but ofcourse that's helping no one. I just felt like needed something - idk what and just decided to post here. There's a lot more to it, but I try to cut it our for brevity", "subreddit": "lonely"}

While I reckon that's subjective per person, I have a different message I'd like to tell my past self. \n\n\n\n\n**And I'm gonna share it here tonight because why not** \n\n\n\nDear past me,\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThere are a lot of things I'd like to say, most of which have already been said. You're in a dark place right now at 15, and I'd like to say it gets better. I'd like to... *But it doesn't.* \n\n\n\n\nYou just got done with being bullied in middle school, so I'd **also** like to tell you the worst part is over. **It's not**. Matter of fact, I'd go so far as to say the easiest day was yesterday. \n\n\n\n\n\nWe were never promised an easy life, but you didn't exactly make it easy for the two of us either. Making zero effort with the way you dressed (which, by the way, was all black and dark blue no matter what season it was). You wondered why people thought you were weird regardless of all the cringey shit you'd say and do, your doubt of your own self-worth, molded solely from the things complete strangers would tell you... Yeah yeah, I get it - the whole \"wElL StRaNgEr's OpInIoNs aRE mORe imPorTaNT bEcoZ tHeY dOn'T hAVe tuH woRrY aBoUt YoU LiKiNg tHem\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBut something **nobody** else wanted to tell you at the time is that teenagers are assholes. I'm not saying you didn't deserve to get bullied and made fun of back in the day based on how you looked -- I'm just saying you should've given a few more fucks about how you carried yourself and talk to a few people for once in your damn life. \n\n\n\n\n\nMaybe then we wouldn't be 23 fucking years old shitposting on a subreddit that's specifically **meant** for people that \"failed\" their past selves. No... I didn't fail you.\n\n\n\n\n**You failed US.** I wish I could go back and time and make things right... Undo every little fuck-up you did. Maybe then you wouldn't be alone. Maybe then the both of us could finally be happy in our own skin. \n\n\n\n\nI'm sure 30 year old me's gonna be pissed off too when they realize how much time was thrown down the shitter - and you were the first rung on the totem pole. \n\n\n\n\nI'm working hard daily to undo the things you did to us. I'd **ALMOST** go as far as to say I **ALMOST** don't hate the skin I'm in. Almost. That's sure as shit an improvement from how we'd normally talk about ourselves. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nOh yeah, and of course the obligatory \"Fuck you\" for ruining the start of what could'a been something really awesome. \n\n\n\n\n\nSigned, Present Me", "subreddit": "ForeverAlone"}

My mind is always occupied because I\u2019m always thinking everyday, sometimes it drives me crazy but I control it from a day to day basis, I don\u2019t really see myself as \u201cinsane\u201d but I\u2019m very concerned with my mental health because sometimes I always just find activities to occupy myself. I\u2019m troubled with something that\u2019s happening in my life? I\u2019m not saying what it is but please take this as a sign that I\u2019m not clear. I love everyone in my life I hope I can push through this. I think I can probably push through this, everyone is trying to help me but I\u2019m just self conscious about something and I think I need to open up a little on this site to relieve this  horrible weight on my mental health, it\u2019s not clear but I don\u2019t see myself having much of a future. I\u2019ve been drowning myself in a lot of Daniel Caesar, he has been letting me know that I can make it through anything  (didn\u2019t say it to me but you get what I mean) I love everyone I love everyone I love everyone. Please don\u2019t take this post as a sign of a mental illness just please know that I don\u2019t know what to do in my life now because I feel like a failed person. My age is not going to be disclosed on this post since I don\u2019t want anyone finding out who I am but people like me need therapy because we need a shoulder to lean on. I love everyone. I am on a job search for myself. My cousins and nieces have expected more from me but I just want them to know that I love them very much even if my worst doesn\u2019t show it. If they see me as a failure, that\u2019s fine but I just want them to know that my blessing is with all of my family. I just need to adore someone or else I will bring myself to insanity. My friends have been keeping touch with me which has helped me through these past few years, they are the reason I\u2019m here. I\u2019d say that 80% of my friends from high school are not in connection with me anymore. I\u2019ve known a couple of people that have committed because they couldn\u2019t handle the pressure, I\u2019m blessed to know that there is always a solution. No matter what I always keep my compassion and my love for everyone. I can\u2019t be mean to anyone because I truly don\u2019t know how it affects them. My father is a hard worker, he has worked hard for me and my family for his whole life, I never go by a day by thanking god that my father is always supporting me but I just can\u2019t handle myself because I can\u2019t function normally. I used to stop by the gym a lot, I saw a lady for the past year or two, this lady was around her late 20s and she starved herself to try to capture a body image that she strives to get. Her doctors always stopped by and said that she needed to eat, it had to even go to a point where she had to live off a machine, if I were to say an estimation of size, I\u2019d say she was like 5\u20196 and 60 pounds, I could see her bone imprints on her skin, I had even offered to order her some Postmates to the gym but she had rejected and I couldn\u2019t really help her. She doesn\u2019t go to the gym anymore, I don\u2019t know what happened after her after she had left to go for a jog outside. But I digress, I never want to push myself to do nothing I don\u2019t want to do, stuff like that makes me want to commit suicide, I don\u2019t even care if I make minimum wage, I want to do something I love. This is why people get stressed out day to day. I\u2019d rather have a 12k salary while enjoying my life rather than a 60k salary and living in constant downward mentality. I never committed myself to relationships because I\u2019ve always seen them as temporary. It might seem like I\u2019m selfish but I just want to live happily with myself, by myself. I can\u2019t see myself caring for another person simply because it\u2019s too much work to do. I recently bought some AirPods, it was cool at first but I found myself not caring about money anymore, I\u2019ve had 8-9kish in my safe but I\u2019ve probably went through 2k in around a month, it\u2019s probably not the AirPods but it\u2019s probably my wrong mindset. Let me tell you a story, it\u2019s about this kid named uhh, I\u2019ll just call him Max, Max was 3 grades under me, I was in 10th, he was in 7th. I always had faith in him because he was a straight A student, he never failed any subject and always kept a good mindset about real life situations, he had started speaking about this kid named.. Let\u2019s just call him Tariq. Tariq was a known drug dealer around the block for weed and stolen iPhones. Believe it or not, Tariq started selling weed in the 6th grade, he was in the same grade as Max so there was no age difference. Max found out about Tariq through class, I told Max, \u201cWhy are you getting involved with this shit? It just ruins you and is a money waster\u201d I\u2019m not against weed but I just don\u2019t want this kid to take the wrong path after he had paved himself great lead to success, he said \u201cI want to get high\u201d I couldn\u2019t believe this kid, next thing you know, Max starts buying ounces then soon pounds until Tariq sent one of his people out to rob him, over 1k of marijuana just snatched away from him and Tariq ended communications from messages, ig, whatsapp everything. Max learned his lesson but boy this surely hit harder, Max kept a knife from when he did weed in his backpack, random kid whistle blows about it and Max gets caught with a knife in school, police get a warrant to look through his phone and they find Tariq\u2019s past texts with him. Next thing you know Max has 3 court dates he has to attend. As you can tell, Tariq isn\u2019t so happy so he actually gets people to shoot up his home, around 6k of damages were caused like car windows, a tv and home windows. They also shot his ankle while he was laying down on the couch so you know this was no joke. Max ends up forking out 6k from his savings for legal fees and gets his sentence reduced to 3 years but Tariq not known to be seen ANYWHERE. Max had learned his lesson but doesn\u2019t have any job opportunities anymore because of the jail time and had dropped out at age 17,  he is currently working as a iHop worker at the moment. I never want anyone to have the experience Mad did, he had transformed to a whole other person I hadn\u2019t known. But I\u2019m sorry for my chit chatting, I had just needed to open up about my life because I\u2019m dealing with a great amount of stress. Whoever is reading this, I\u2019m grateful for you and I hope amazing stuff come to you. My sister had just given me a Stussy shirt , it\u2019s cool I guess but I want to be remembered like that, it\u2019s not the brand but more of a symbol of my trust, saying I appreciate anyone that shows me they appreciate my existence and that it provide a sign that they know who I am.

We improve our social skills, we improve our careers, we improve ourselves physically by exercising and we do our best, but we cannot change what another person in our life thinks about us. We can try to change what people think about us, but what another entire individual thinks or feels about us is up to them. You're not in as control of this part of your life as you think you are. Especially, with physical attraction which is heavily dependent upon your genetics at birth. Some people can do all the self improvement imaginable it won't make them able to fight against their genetics. That doesn't mean anyone should immediately give up I think you should try your best, but I would not judge anyone who tries and gives up. There is a limit to self improvement and you should not allow people to shame you for self improving and still struggling and listening to them say that you just haven't self improved enough.\n\nI know how bad that is to repeatedly go through rejection and getting ghosted on. You tell yourself you'll drop your standards you drop your standards and try again and are still met with failure. At some point you gotta ask yourself are you really screwing up so bad that 100% of the blame is on yourself or is the dating scene actually messed up badly? The best thing for a lot of us is to accept the darkness that we're gonna possibly be alone for long periods of time without validation from people. This problem we're in is not 100% our fault. So my request is a mission for you all. The mission is to learn to be happy yourself.\n\nYes it's messed up we're in this situation, but this problem is not so serious that we need to be going to 50 to 100 people a week approaching them trying to ask out them out. So don't fight it. Accept it and embrace the loneliness focus on yourself and become the best version of yourself. When you embrace that and you turn that into positive energy you're going to become a much emotionally stronger person. At the end of the day when the smoke clears who's there? You. You're the one who's always there in the end. So you gotta learn to become comfortable with your situation despite how hard it is. Let's get a discussion going would love to hear your thoughts regarding this for those who agree or disagree. For those who disagree let me know how your self improvement saved you from FA and got you out of this situation I would love to hear a positive story.", "subreddit": "ForeverAlone"}

Anywho they drank throughout the evening and this girl was been bit suggestive (sexually) even tho i turned her down.  I see her quite often sober and she is always this quiet and careful person like she'd been though something before.\n\nWell past few weeks i have seen her more often drunk than sober and about a week ago she asked me to go drink with her and i had to pass cause i wasn't at home. Later that night she had sent me a photo on snapchat of an ER/hospital reception and i didn't think too much about it till few days later when my friend got an photo of her been back at the same ER/hospital. My friend tried to ask her friend what happen and didn't get an answer so he asked her and she told him that she had tried to commit suicide and apparently failed (fortunately). \n\nI've been thinking about her and asking if shes ok, but i haven't had the courage to do that and now i am feeling even more lonely and sad cause, i like her and i fear of her trying again.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThank you for reading", "subreddit": "lonely"}

People liked me. I like to think I had a lot of friends back then. \n\nBut now I\u2019m in my 20s and I feel like I belong nowhere. I\u2019ve felt like this for years. Nothing about me fits in or feels comfortable in a group. Nothing about me is something I can be proud of. Even my hobbies I\u2019m mediocre at. \n\nFor example:\n-I\u2019m Italian/Portuguese by birth and don\u2019t have a white face structure, but am white by birth. Almost no white person has ever viewed me as white and they get awkward when I tell them my ancestry. Everyone asks about my ancestry. \u201cWhat are you?\u201d I hear that all the time. I\u2019ve been invited to clubs geared for people of color but I know I don\u2019t belong there and I don\u2019t want to intrude on a space that isn\u2019t mine. \n\n-I\u2019m a trans guy but I don\u2019t feel comfortable with it. When I identified as female I was honestly pretty popular. Now everyone at my school treats me as if I\u2019ve had male privilege all my life and act as though I\u2019ll never have any idea what women go through, even though I\u2019ve experienced it firsthand. And I\u2019ve gained pretty much no privilege through it. I\u2019ve been beaten and ridiculed because I\u2019m small and meek and for men I guess that isn\u2019t allowed. I\u2019m not one of the guys but I can\u2019t be one of the girls either and it makes me feel chokingly alone. \n\n-I\u2019m bi but have had a lot of negative experiences with the LGBT community in recent years, with people constantly shitting on male identifying people and acting as though if you\u2019re bi and you date the opposite sex you\u2019re a traitor and don\u2019t actually know what it\u2019s like to be LGBT. But I don\u2019t feel comfortable around only straight people because when they start talking about relationship stuff I can\u2019t relate. \n\n-I have some form of community around art and video games, but I\u2019m god awful at video games and mediocre at best at art. I can\u2019t draw anything I want and when I try I just get depressed and give up because I feel like I\u2019ll never get to my goal so why bother. When I play video games with my friends they always get annoyed because I make stupid errors and always mess things up for everyone. \n\nI started to get an anxiety attack today when I tried to go to my school\u2019s club day (where all the clubs are out trying to get people to join them) because there were so many identity groups and all of my friends were getting invited to join things and I saw nothing I could fit in with. I don\u2019t think I ever will. \n\nI believe in reincarnation, and I\u2019m just barely keeping myself from trying to end my life in hopes that it will start over as something that gives me a better feeling of purpose. No amount of medication or therapy has helped me. Everything hurts. I want to go to a hospital but I would have to miss school and my school has an extremely strict absence policy.

I've never been able to have a conversation about my worries or struggles with him and he never asked. As long as I wasn't in trouble, it didn't concern him. Even to this day, he still treats me like some unruly teenager and his \"adult\" conversation simply involves talking work with me. Because that's what men do, right?\n\nWell, I snapped and yelled/asked, \"Had it ever occured to you that it might be because I'm stressed? That maybe everything isn't going well for me?\"\n\nAfter that bit, we had a \"chat\" and eventually it led to him offering up meds and other remedies for my insomnia. Better than nothing I suppose but not much more than before. Depression, to him, is something I force upon myself. Something to cure with a bit of sex and alcohol.\n\nNow he wants to do the thing he never did with me: have a drink and chat.\n\nTook me to some shady little ranch that brews it's own beer and stables horses as well as other animals. I was just happy to see the animals.\n\nI don't really know why I'm talking about this. It doesn't have much of a point. It's just an example of how well I can hide my troubles until it's just too much to bear. \n\nAlso, play with animals guys.

I wanted to share how my jealousy and insecurities lead to driving my partner away. I\u2019m a 20 M and I don\u2019t really have a lot of friends. The friends I did have during my relationship became very toxic to me and put me down a lot. I feel I was always the but of the joke but because this was my first real friend group I tried really hard to try fit in. Anything I said on our gc somehow lead to a joke about me. Back to my relationship, my girlfriend had a pretty good friend group. They went out all the time and always had each other\u2019s backs. I was afraid that without no friend my girlfriend would think of me as a loser, not to mention me losing almost all my self esteem. Every time she talked sbt what she did with her friends I used to get upset and jealous, causing me to act out, cause unnecessary fights and even sometimes ignore her. I put her through alot and I feel like she could never understand me. I constantly felt she would put her friends before me when that wasn\u2019t really the case, she was just hanging out with her friends. This eventually lead to our breakup, even after begging her not to leave. Now I just feel really shitty, not having anyone to talk to but somehow beginning to make new friends and work on myself. I guess I didn\u2019t really realise the result of my behaviour before it was too late. I\u2019m still not sure if telling her about my friend situation would\u2019ve been a good idea and I\u2019m not sure how she would\u2019ve reacted to it.

I want to get something off my chest.\n\nAll my life, from elementary to where I am now at the age of 21, I always seemed to be a loner in someway. Sure, I have and had friends but never really get invited by the old group anymore. It feels pretty exhausting to always be alone even though I can have fun on my own pretty well and used to be good at amusing myself. The last 5 years of my life I have been struggling with insecurity, stress and other mental problems which make me feel isolated. Physical symptoms of the tension I carry around seem to manifest in my stomach, pelvic muscles/hips and lower back. I am already speaking with a therapist about problems but I never have felt understood by others even though my communication and social skills do not lack that much at all and you would probably not even notice anything off. Sadly, I don't feel any connection with people around me and I had this feeling since I was about 16 years old. This was also the age where I slowly developed some bad habits like worrying about everything and becoming insecure over time which interferes with everything. I also have social anxiety and feel very self consious which makes it hard to really connect with others. It is like I am constantly living in my head. I do still have some friends but well, they barely have time or don't really want to go out and do something. I feel stuck with my thoughts a lot and expressing them does not really help me. Lately I was figuring out some more about mindfulness as a possible tool for relaxation on a mental and physical level so I can start working towards living a more fulfilling existence.

Maybe I need some support. But I\u2019ve been at college for a grand total of one week and so far my mental health is really suffering for it. I debated about posting this on r/depression or r/anxiety because both of those things have really been a bitch lately, but I think this is the most fitting place. Because when it comes down to it, loneliness is what\u2019s really contributing to both of them. Gut wrenching, mind numbing, really fucking painful loneliness. It hurts so bad. It hurts to see everyone making friends. It hurts to see my old friends from high school making friends. It hurts to keep eating my meals alone. It hurts to be in a group of people I feel no connection with because I forced myself to engage in social interaction. I\u2019ve been doing that lately. Like I get so desperate for human connection that I eat with these people I honestly can\u2019t stand. They basically ignore me anyway, either that or I barely speak because I feel so empty. But it still hurts. I think it\u2019s actually more lonely to be in a group of people you feel so disconnected than to be alone. So a lot of times I choose alone. I realize that has both positive and negative ramifications. Anyway, it\u2019s so hard being here. It\u2019s not so much that I miss my family or being home. Or maybe I do. I guess I miss the familiarity a little bit. I like that I\u2019m in a totally different environment now. But I haven\u2019t really connected with anyone here and my failing mental health makes it so goddamn hard to try. You know that exhaustive cycle? You can barely get out of bed, so you don\u2019t go out. You don\u2019t meet people. Which makes it so much harder. So you keep laying in bed. And then you are that much more alone for that much longer. I\u2019ve been trying as much as I can. I talk to people, get their phone numbers, reach out. I try to force myself to go events on campus when I can. But fuck, sometimes they make me feel worse. I know what many of you will say. I haven\u2019t been here that long. Give it time. Trust me, I know. I do. Maybe there\u2019s hope in the future. I can\u2019t know for sure. So I guess I\u2019m asking for some support for right now. Support through this crushing loneliness. This non stop need to sob my heart out. The anxiety attacks. The urges to self harm. The trapped feeling I get when I realize I have no where to go because my roommate is home and I can\u2019t feel comfortable around her to let myself just be sad. The lack of will to eat. I\u2019m staring at this fruit I got from the dining hall right now and I\u2019m not sure I can even bring myself to eat that. So if anyone has any advice or words of encouragement, that would be lovely. \nThank You.", "subreddit": "lonely"}

In fact, representation is pretty ridiculous if you think about it because we aren't diseased. There is no reason to raise awareness. \n\nHowever, I've felt more in touch with poor old Nigel than I have with any person in a very long time. For all the misery he endured, he is hailed as a hero now for managing to help preservation efforts. I think we can all aspire to be that much of a contribution. \n\nIf we can't help ourselves, we can at least try to help others.\n\nSo, in the spirit of that, I've collected some images of Nigel. Maybe some of you can find better ones, or maybe even create some original artwork dedicated to him.\n\nThanks for reading, and I hope I'm not out of line here. \n\nLet me know if there are any issues.\n\n[Stoic Nigel](https://i.imgur.com/0ZmRTU2.jpg)\n\n[Nigel, King of Mana](https://i.imgur.com/S7WvoJb.jpg)\n\n[Loving Nigel](https://i.imgur.com/gWQWsoh.jpg)\n\n[Loving Nigel 2](https://i.imgur.com/HEr3hgL.png)\n\n[Attentive Nigel](https://i.imgur.com/eaQCJ5e.jpg)\n\n[Calm Nigel](https://i.imgur.com/tKsz1cc.jpg)\n\n[Nigel and Friends](https://i.imgur.com/Ie6BmSx.jpg)\n\n[Nigel Returns](https://i.imgur.com/ScC9YoR.jpg)\n\n[Nigel in Flight](https://i.imgur.com/7JaFizm.jpg)\n\n[Nigel in Thought](https://i.imgur.com/EXtzrZt.jpg)\n\n[Nigel on the Cliff](https://i.imgur.com/CKyaV1e.jpg)\n\n[Artwork by Jerri Stroud](https://i.imgur.com/k56QYOa.jpg)\n\n[Link to Jerri Stroud's article](https://www.google.com/amp/s/jerristroud.wordpress.com/2018/03/01/nigel-you-hardly-knew-her/amp/)\n\n[Link to Gizmodo article](https://www.google.com/amp/s/gizmodo.com/nigel-the-bird-found-dead-next-to-the-concrete-partner-1822655398/amp)", "subreddit": "ForeverAlone"}

I guess I just wanted to vent and get some things off my chest so I apologize if this is rambling or doesn\u2019t make the most sense. I have a lot going on at the moment and sometimes you just gotta let it out. This is probably gonna be a long ride so buckle up and grab a snack.\n\nI\u2019m 18 years old and I graduated high school this past May. I had some really good close friends, and for the first time in my life I felt like I fit in somewhere. I won\u2019t get into crazy nitty gritty detail, but I had a very rough home life as a kid. My parents divorced when I was 11 and my mom moved myself and her halfway across the country into my abusive and manipulative grandparents\u2019 house when I was 10. I grew up mostly by myself because before my parents divorced, they were always fighting and never had much time for their only child. I was very socially awkward and I wanted to make friends but I didn\u2019t have much in the way of conversation skills. I got bullied A LOT as a kid and I kind of gave up after a while. When my mom and I moved, I was excited to start a new life in a different state. I thought maybe it would be my ticket to a new me. I was wrong. I was still bullied and teased quite frequently at my new school and since I didn\u2019t have a lot of money compared to the other kids I wasn\u2019t \u201ccool\u201d to hang around. I spent a lot of time by myself up until I was just about to turn 17 and had moved to a public school. By this point I was severely depressed and didn\u2019t have anyone to talk to because my grandparents had kicked us out and my mom and I hadn\u2019t been on the best of terms. I thought it would just be better if I were gone and no one had to deal with me. Right as things hit their worst, I met a few people that I really clicked with and started to come out of my shell a bit. By the beginning of senior year, I felt I truly had some strong friends. For the first time in my life I wasn\u2019t completely alone and I had no idea how it felt to be included until then. I started to really be myself and found that I loved hanging out with people and just enjoying their company meant so much to me. When I graduated, we still had a strong friendship and I was happy despite things getting tougher at home.\n\nFlash forward to today. I recently had to move out of my mothers house because I was miserable and she had become incredibly selfish. She barely cared for me after we moved and it got to the point where I went without a lot of things that I needed. I moved in with my father who still lives in the area that we did before my mom moved us. I\u2019m excited to begin a new life and have a better quality of life, but I\u2019m terrified because I realize I\u2019m going to be alone again. My friends back home are slowly beginning to move on and they\u2019re making new friends of their own. I\u2019m genuinely happy for them and I\u2019m thrilled that they\u2019re thriving, but at the same time I\u2019m nervous because I know in my heart that we probably will lose contact in the next year or so. I know it\u2019s a part of life and it\u2019s normal, and part of me tried to steel myself for it, but I was wayyyy more unprepared than I thought. I know I\u2019ll eventually have friends again, but that time in between worries me. \n\nIf you have anything you\u2019d like to say or advice, please comment.

L and N send snaps to each other all the time, i used to send snaps to both of them until they sent me less and to each other more (&lt;--- this part feels childish rereading it LOL). its just crazy bc i dont think i really changed, i treated them both equally as my best, best friends but somehow the two of them grew closer.\n\nthe three of us hang out a lot together, occasionally in pairs, but every time i hang out with either L or N it was a time when the other person couldn't go. at times L and N would hang out unbeknownst to me before i would see it in a post where i could correctly guess the two were together. this happened three days ago. i didnt know they were hanging out, N's posts showed she was with someone but i couldnt tell who then L's posts revealed who. then N facetimed me later but i didnt answer bc i was in the shower. i texted N sorry for missing her call and she said it was fine, L and N wanted to talk and i said okay i can call u guys back in an hour but then N said it was fine and i just didnt ask what they wanted to talk about bc i didnt really care and i was thinking like what's the point, they didnt want me there with them anyways. i mean they don't have to tell me whenever spend time with each other or why they don't include me, that's their business but i keep letting myself get hurt by this. \n\nbasically i always feel like a third, unimportant wheel, a background friend, that i don't really matter as much, that im a great friend to them both and i know they appreciate me but i think they would be really fine if i wasnt there. \n\n**here's a star for reading this far: \u2606**\n\ni think i played myself into thinking there are three-way friendships. there's always gonna be an odd one out and im not sure what i did to be and feel like the third. i guess L and N had a subsubgroup together without me as a part of it. i just wish i was someone's first choice. im dumb for thinking i can have two people both be my first choices in telling them important stuff that i want to share and im a clown for assuming they felt the same way. \n\nthe thing is they're both awesome people and i love them a lot even tho they pain me and i know they don't intentionally want to make me feel excluded its just how it is. but i can't tell them how i feel im on the outside a lot of the times because i think it would hurt their feelings and if they did know how i felt it would certainly change the friendship and make me feel even more out. i think their efforts to include me would be unnatural to us all and even feel forced. but as i said i love them both and i still want them to be in my life or else who would share funny memes with, tell my problems to, people i can depend on and just be my best friends. im thankful for the memories we all shared together but (this sounds really bad) idk if they great feelings &amp; memories were worth feeling left out on the days when memories weren't made. \n\ni just really want to find \"my person\" like cristina and meredith on grey's anatomy\n\n**here's TWO stars for reading this far:** \u2606\u2606\n\ni guess my point is: **i don't really know what to do**", "subreddit": "lonely"}

I'm 23 M and never even kissed anyone. I started dating earlier this year. I'm not really ashamed about my situation, but it's something that I've woken up to over the past year or so. I was looking at various statistics on this topic, and it seems I'm about 5 years past the average age to lose one's V card in most western, English speaking countries, in fact in all the countries surveyed, I'm past the average age. By age 25, &lt;5 or 10% of people remain virgins. Surely the number of religious people is a lot higher than 5%. In many countries, the average age for marriage seems to be in the 25-33 or so range. Some of these countries (&gt;90% of the population) are devoutly religious. This got me thinking: what about young adults who are religious and unmarried? It seems like there is a lot of sinning going on out there! I was having an awkward discussion about this with my mum, and she laughed at me when I mentioned this, and said, \"I didn't think you were so naive!\". I am a Christian, as are most of my family.

My best friend lives a good drive away and because of my new job, I cant really make time to go over to his place.

Our mutual friend still plays, which caused us to lose touch aswell. \n\nAs I mentioned, I started a new job 2 months ago. It keeps me distracted, but I developed a pretty big crush on a colleague. She comes to shop a lot with her new BF in her free time and it just hurts every time I see them together. At home, I basically just sit around and play Video Games all the time when I have free time.\n\nI started playing Classic WoW when it came out and had a pretty good time, found a cool guild to join etc.\n\nBut since my everyday mood went downhill again, I feel worse and worse about them because they all know eachother for a long time (coming from Live WoW together) and I just feel like a third (or more accurately sixth) wheel whenever I lurk around in our/their Teamspeak. \n\nSo that marks the current day, just been drinking mead, watching YT and playing WoW all day.

So, truth is no one knew who I really am, ever. \n\nI moved out of the house and went on to college when I was 18 and I never really liked being with people. Mostly because I think I didn't want to trust anyone and also because I didn't feel connected to anyone. But, I was stubborn and fine on my own when I was young, I never thought I would feel lonely. \n\nNow, I am 25 years old and starting to feel like maybe I need someone to come home to or call up to hang out during a weekend. I live in isolation, I work in contracting so colleagues aren't too social and I live far. Only people I could call friends are the ones I made on the internet. \n\nIs this a normal thing?

We have grown through puberty, teenage hood, and into adulthood without understanding what sex and relationships are (I'll just say sex to make it shorter).\n\nTake my Chad housemate for example, he has a ltr girlfriend, and he regularly gets threesomes, with men or women as the third partner. He probably has had sex since his teens. He can't possibly have the same virgin lust view of sex as us.\n\nYou've seen the tinder Chad post? That guy gets sex all the time, he may or may not fantasize about every other women, but he gets so many partners he doesn't know what un reciprocated mean. He doesn't have the same view on faithfulness as us. His culture, and that of my housemate, is widely different from a FA culture.\n\nYou know the memes advices, some are \"treat her like a human being\", and \"don't put her on a pedestall\". You see for a normie or a Chad, this is normal, in their culture a good part of humans could have sex with them (directly or in a group), whilst for us it would mean something so unique. And they don't put them on a pedestal, because they could get others, and they understand how easy sex is for everyone. For them sex is like inviting someone to your home or being invited. And if you are like me you might think \"but op being invited already feel like the world\", and so does sex.\n\nWe can't possibly understand dating, taking your time, FWB, swingers, cuckold, threesomes, ONS, or simple sex and relationships.\n\nLors of young men may not understand women because of the difficulty acting gap or Old gap (online dating gap), the same way men and women don't understand sex the same way because of the orgasm gap.\nBut we as FA have something even less common, we have the FA-gap.\n\nI'll hope you'll escape guys, I'm in my mid twenties (older half of it) and I know I'll need a true enlightment to finally understand relationships and sex, the longer I wait the more foreign it sounds, and the less likely I am to escape.\n\nI need to learn this culture.", "subreddit": "ForeverAlone"}

And I need a large enough pool of potentials to account for possible failures. After all just because she's, blind or actually demi sexual or the one in (bullshit number based on observation) 100,000 not all about looks. There is no guarantee that it will work regardless of how much either of us want it to. So I need a large enough pool of unicorns to have a real chance of success. While dealing with a much larger pool of fake unicorns that only want a free meal, emotional validation, or someone they want to use as a resource only as is willing to lead them on to do so. Normal people who had this large enough pool, as they didn't need a unicorn to look past their perfectly neurotypical personality, or passable levels of body type and facial structure. They just needed another normal person. So I can see how they would have trouble imagining it from the other side\n\nTo put it another way. If each FA with their unique challanges are looking for let's just say a one in ten thousand person, there are one in, for arguments sake, 3000 people who meet this criteria. Because this unicorn, if for not any reason other than the fact they are obviously a kind, open minded, and non-shallow person. Regardless of personal beauty, though they will also likely be of passable form, build, and social intelligence will have a daring pool of at least one in a hundred, in other words at least normally desirable. In summary there are a few people, that are acceptable to even fewer people, and these people are also desired by a lot more people.\n\nSooo is that dating pool and odds structure something anyone would be happy to take a shot at? Even if you shrink the numbers, you'd have better luck letting it ride on 00 in Vegas five times and leaving with money, than some of us have in the dating world... and that is why luck is the most important factor.\n\nThis can go for both Male and female FA who's issues don't relate to depression, or anxiety and thus never play the odds and could, with help be a 1 in say 100 normal or even below normal in attraction person. When the problem is being obviously awkward.(something most autistic people can't just choose, not to do.) Paired with a less than nearly perfect physique, face and grooming. Or being on the lowest tier of physical attraction. (Assymetry, distorted features, and bad bone structure) while having too few social opportunities to ever get to the social skill level needed for \"preparedness\". The odds, just arent in your favor.\n\nMy numbers are bleak, observational, and pulled directly from my ass, but even much lower it shows what a limited dating pool can do to make it likely that most of us older FA.. just aren't going to make it.", "subreddit": "ForeverAlone"}

The girl I had dated was a long time friend and a relationship just seemed a natural extension of our friendship. We were very clearly not meant for each other; I had a very strong sex drive while she was asexual, and we were set to go to school on opposite ends of the country. Still, those 3 months of my life were among my happiest, and I\u2019ve spent the past several years trying to recreate that feeling in my life.\n\nGoing to a large university I thought for sure I\u2019d be able to meet someone, but that never happened. I was in a male dominated STEM major and the few women who were in my classes grouped together and seemingly wanted nothing to do with me. Extracurriculars weren\u2019t a help either; I got the feeling that all the girls in the groups I joined were already spoken for and I certainly didn\u2019t become close with any girls during my time there. \n\nSometime freshman year I picked up online dating. My profile was pretty generic, a few simple pictures of me and a short bio about how I wanted to find a girl to laugh with. I was really banking on winning over girls through conversation. I\u2019ve been on these apps almost 4 years now and I have nothing to show for it. To start with I rarely get matches, if I get 1 a week I consider myself lucky. A lot of matches don\u2019t stick around long, I typically don\u2019t even get a response from most. Even girls who seem willing to give me a shot lose interest very quickly. I may find a girl I think really connect with only to see I\u2019m unmatched the next day. I\u2019ve really grown weary of online dating at this point, I can\u2019t continue to put my heart into every match only to receive lukewarm feedback in response. \n\nHaving graduated, I\u2019ve moved back home temporarily to focus on transitioning my life into starting my career, and here I thought I had a breakthrough. An old high school crush is still in town due to some personal issues. I\u2019ve stayed in contact with her over the years and I honestly thought I had an opening. She\u2019s bored and has little social life, if any at all. Me moving back to town is probably the most interaction she\u2019s had with a peer in a long while. I thought that I\u2019d be able to recreate what I had right out of high school, that I\u2019d be her weekly excuse to get out of the house and we\u2019d have a strong, fun relationship based upon our already underlying friendship. But it wasn\u2019t meant to be, she told me she only thinks of me as a friend and that she wants to focus on her own life rather than date. \n\nNow I\u2019m left feeling dejected. Everywhere I look I see dead ends. 4 years at a large university and I know no one I could conceivably ask out. The girl I\u2019ve crushed on for so long doesn\u2019t see me in a romantic light, and the dating apps are just as tepid as they\u2019ve always been. I don\u2019t even have an avenue to meet new people any longer, I\u2019m mostly stuck at home helping around the house or interviewing for positions.

I moved into a 2 bedroom trailer home in my families property. My dad, my grandpa, my aunt and a couple cousins around my age (late 20s/early 30s) all live in the property in separate houses. I moved originally with my best friend, but half a year in he had to go back home to take care of his grandma. I\u2019ve been in and out of a shitty relationship in between. Anyways recently I\u2019ve felt really isolated and lonely. My female cousin I hang out had a different schedule so we don\u2019t hang out as much and she\u2019s going through some emotional stuff too, my two friends (who are married) have been doing their own thing, so I basically don\u2019t interact with people that much except at work. I don\u2019t have any go to friends, even my cousin were aren\u2019t supppperr close. It just feels weird. To make things worse my best friend met a guy awhile back who he\u2019s friends with benefits with but also has formed a friendship with and who hangs out with all the time. Since this has happened he has started talking to me less and less or when we do talk I get one word answers. I\u2019m not into confrontation and he\u2019s one not take things the best, he just gets upset. But I tried mentioning just if he was okay, was there something I did that\u2019s been bothering him and that\u2019s why he\u2019s distancing himself but he said everything was good but didn\u2019t really explain why he\u2019s been distant. It made me feel really sad because I only have one best friend and I\u2019m not close with anyone here enough to really go to to talk about these feelings because he was the person I\u2019d go to. We\u2019ve been best friends for over 10 years, super close, he\u2019s like my soul mate (he\u2019s gay so not a in love kind of situation). It just seems since he\u2019s moved back we\u2019ve been slowly falling out. It sucks. It sucks because I don\u2019t really have close friends out here. My cousin and two married friends are more like close acquaintances. \nThis is also the longest I\u2019ve been single. Once I got passed a shitty relationship a year ago I haven\u2019t dated since, I\u2019m on dating sites because I don\u2019t go out much and it\u2019s been discouraging. I go back and forth between me feeling like \u201cwhat if I\u2019m placing the bar to high\u201d and \u201cno I shouldn\u2019t settle if I don\u2019t have enough attraction to this person to date them\u201d. It\u2019s been very depressing dating wise.\n\nIt\u2019s all kind of hard because I\u2019m from Los Angeles and had A LOT of friends in LA. I had guys I would date, I had fuck buddies, I had family and my best friend. To barely being friends with two people who aren\u2019t related to me. \n\nWith all this said I\u2019m trying to flip this.

The next few years were good, we hung out, gamed, spoke all the time. But i quickly realised some things had been rewired in him from all the drugs. It was him, but not him. In 2016, his mother passed, and I moved interstate. I was there for him as much as i could be.. but as the time went on contact became infrequent.

They would tease the way I spoke, my hobbies and passions (especially since I was a big movie buff back then), my clothes, even my brother they called names and insulted which still pisses me off to this day. And there\u2019s nothing I can do about it.\n\nI did have some friends throughout my school years but I\u2019ve never had a \u201cbest friend\u201d or anything like that. After I left school and started using drugs the only people I knew were ones who wanted to use me for the drugs I supplied them with, and not for me as a person. Since then I\u2019ve made no new friends, let alone a single one who would appreciate me for who I am. \n\nAfter a long series of events that have taken place over the past 3 years, I woke up yesterday and realized that I have NOBODY. Even my parents look down on me and criticize my shortcomings. No friends, no job, no social life either in any way whatsoever. Basically im a hermit who can\u2019t even muster up the energy to get out and go to the gym. Women look at me with pity in their eyes if they look at me at all, and pretty much I\u2019m totally invisible to the world. \n\nNow the fact that the world doesn\u2019t accept me is fine. I can deal with it even if it\u2019s not the optimal situation to be in. The real issue is the physical pain I feel when I want to fit in, to have a cool and fun group of friends, to have a girl in my life alongside whom I can share and create in the beauty of life together. \n\nIt\u2019s a pain that runs so deep I can feel it in my bones, the pit of my stomach, everywhere. I struggle at night the most. Violent outbursts of crying and shaking  in the early hours of the morning keeping me from getting sleep which impacts my mood the next day, which then feeds into my loneliness. It\u2019s like a vicious cycle that I can\u2019t escape from. \n\nIn fact this loneliness may just be the most pain I\u2019ve ever felt. And I am at rock bottom in every way other than I still have a roof over my head. \n\nBut yeah, loneliness sucks and it runs far deeper than I ever could have imagined.", "subreddit": "lonely"}

Overwhelming issues like corruption, poverty, global warming, violence, working jobs endlessly without progress, etc. You'll often hear the words \"The world is going to shit\" followed by sad eyes pushing this idea to the back of their mind. Many people seem to have lost hope, feeling that there is nothing they could do.\n\nI personally don't believe the world is going to be destroyed by humanity or anything like that anytime soon, or that there is little we can do about these humongous, overwhelming problems. I firmly believe that a single person can make a bigger difference than anyone else I've talked to seems to really believe. I mean, consider this: our lives have wrapped around technology like the internet and cars so much so that we are forced to use them everyday, whether we want to or not. Yet, at some point in time these inventions would've been considered magic, or impossible. Imagine what's yet to come, and ask yourself what does it take to create such a world changing invention or idea? A single person. So it's been done before, and this is just one example among many.\n\nEveryone does what they do for a reason. All the environment they grew up in leads up to their choices, whether it seems good or bad. Naturally though, I think people are good. There are things everyone and everything does that seem to oppose logic and nature. Ever heard of the cases in the wild where animals take up young from another species? Where's the logic in that? It seems like there's something in our basic instincts that give us morality, that make each and everyone of us naturally good people. It's our environment and perspectives that make some people do bad things or seem bad.\n\nWhat I'm trying to get at here is I believe almost everyone is a good person, and that you all deserve better. I've been dedicating my life towards reinstilling that hope for the world into people's eyes by trying to make a difference myself, as big a difference as I can imagine as an inventor and aerospace engineer. I'll try to prove a single person's power to everyone. If nothing else, it's worth a shot to try. You deserve it. I've just been trudging through college so far, but it's been a slow and especially lonely process. One day, maybe I can make you all feel at least a little better. Til then I guess. Sorry if this is the wrong place to say this all, but you're really the only ones I have to talk to right now. I wish you all the best.\n\nAll this and the one thing I look forward to most, whether I succeed or not, is a warm hug and some words acknowledging my efforts like \"you did it\".", "subreddit": "lonely"}

I used to be so lonely, I had no friends a few years ago. I was very socially anxious, and since I have autism I had a lot of trouble making new friends. Going to college scared me to death. I used to spend all my time at home and crying myself to sleep. Every time I would try to make friends they\u2019d think I\u2019m weird or they\u2019d reject me. Now I live in a student home with amazing roommates that I am good friends with. I have a massive cirkle of friends and people that really care about me. I go on dates and go to festivals and things are better than I ever thought they could be. I am in artschool and all the people there are great.\n\nThe thing that really changed; I stopped giving a damn about what a failure I was and I started challenging myself. I would go out all by myself and try to talk to people. I learned to show interest in people and I also learned to be myself and not let people walk over me. I quit a long relationship with a narcissistic boyfriend that treated me like shit, which made me realise my self worth. I learned to stand up for myself, to be there, I learned when to do it and when to back off. \nMost of all I think I found my passion, you are more interesting to others if you know what you like and are proud of it. You should always dare to challenge yourself, go further, grow as a person. And you can. I went from a lonely depressed socially anxious weirdo to an outgoing happy passionate weirdo in just a few years. Give yourself some time, stop being your own worst enemy. You have yourself, even if you have no other friends. Be your own friend. Learn, grow, and find that you actually will get better. Keep holding on everyone, keep growing.

It\u2019s perfectly normal to say, \u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d If you want to know something more, say it, find and share the results. Or maybe you even decide to work together with your interlocutor to find the answer to his question.\n\n3. Answer (facts and feelings) rather than react (only feelings): for example: \u201cTell me more about what worries you,\u201d or: \u201cI understand your discontent\u201d instead of: \u201cListen, I'm just doing my job! \", Or:\" This is not my business! \"(This phrase will definitely cause even more irritation). Share responsibility for the outcome of any communication in which you take part, and understand that sometimes (or maybe even often), your personal reaction can cause all communication problems.\n\nBy the way, join new interesting subreddit: r/college_buzz", "subreddit": "ForeverAlone"}

And they are. That's what it comes down to. I know how to talk to girls (people in general) especially over text when I actually have the time to come up with good responses. I've been talking to each of them over text and snapchat for between 1 and 2 weeks and set up dates for with each of them (coffee, movies, park). And while they've obviously seen pictures of me on snapchat and my app profiles, I'm *really* good at using angles and lighting and all of that, and so I look worse in person. My eyes are round and asymmetric. My mouth is weirdly shaped and I have an overbite with my two front teeth. My face is fat as fuck despite the fact that I'm so damn skinny (5'9, 155 pounds and I work out a lot; probably look bigger and taller in my pics, too). I have no jawline or cheekbones to speak of. I have natural red circles under my eyes. My nose is bulbous, ugly, and points up. My facial hair is patchy and weird but I look like I'm 12 without it. The list goes on.\n\nAnd it makes me so depressed knowing that if I were an above average looking dude, I could go into these dates so confidently, have a great time, and most likely continue to get to know these girls. But I don't even want to subject myself to seeing the look of disappointment on their faces when we finally meet in person, knowing the entire date I'm not going to get a text back once this is over. Also, I feel bad deceiving them like that and wouldn't want to do that to them either. It's pointless and I shouldn't have tried to get this far with any of them in the first place, knowing what the end result would be, but it's so nice to live in fantasy land for at least a little bit. While some of you will tell me to go on the dates anyways because I might as well take a chance now that I'm here, I don't want to totally obliterate my self esteem like that and I'd honestly rather live in ignorance of what would've happened (really, I already know, but it's a lot easier to take in when it's not concrete).", "subreddit": "ForeverAlone"}

All these shows and specials are littered with couple pairings sitting next to each other.\n\nAs a foreveraloner you can't even really enjoy laughter or going out to \"have fun\" because all you are going to see is couples having fun enjoying something you have yearned for and never experienced.\n\nIt really made me think, imagine planning to go to the next show of your favorite comedian, you buy the ticket, its pricey but you think its worth the entertainment, you pay for your flight (if required) and sit through the hours of waiting to get there, you arrive at the outlet and take your seat, you start to notice one by one the room gets flooded by couples, cuddling, holding hands, giggling, but you ignore it because you are here for the show so it doesn't really bug you, the show starts and as the show goes on a joke about sex always comes up, and at each of these jokes you can see couples around you giving each other \"the look\", and you are just there, in the moment, unable to \"participate\"\n\nYou see, these shows are more than just about the actual show contrary to what everyone will tell you, there's a social element to it, really and truly you shouldn't even be there if you don't have a partner because you can't take part in a core aspect of the experience (laughing together).\n\nAlso in that scenario you now have to hope that he doesn't switch to \"insult comic mode\" and point out the fact that you are there on your own. You could go to the show with a friend I guess, but the loneliness of not having a romantic partner will still show on your face over and over and over.\n\nYou can't even enjoy a public performance that's sole purpose is to make you happy, because that performance essentially revolves around something you can't get and have never experienced, watching comedy behind a screen is enjoyable, but at the actual event it would be a completely different experience, because you won't be disconnected from the audience and the social aspect of the show, aspects that you can't participate in, and will make you feel less than throughout the entire experience\n\nNow on the topic of health, recently I started to take a multivitamin, about a week in of taking this daily multivitamin, my libido shot up. All I could do was laugh as I realized there is no fucking escape. I take a multivitamin to boost my health so I can be somewhat happy, and it has that effect, but it also boosts my libido, which makes he hornier than ever, which makes me think about sex more and yearn for it more, which makes me more depressed than usual, and when I'm depressed, I just end up eating fast food.\n\nI know, I know, \"just don't eat fast food\"\n\nTrue, I could do that, but at those moments I literally feel like dying, and good tasting food gives me the dopamine spike I need to keep going, I seriously just feel like dying, like it would be a blessing if died on the spot, I feel completely drained. Eating fast food and putting on a little weight seems like a small trade-off to get rid of this level of depression.\n\nWhat most people don't seem to get is that being \"healthy\" means that your body will function at its optimum, and if you are functioning at your optimum so is your sex drive, so imagine if I were exercising and fit on top of supplementing, I'd probably be even more horny and then even more depressed and tired of life\n\nEverything in life as a biological creature comes down to sex, **EVERYTHING**\n\nThere's is practically nothing you can enjoy, if your sex needs aren't being met, because **THEY ARE ALL INTERTWINED**\n\nWhen faced with the **ABSOLUTE FUTILITY** of trying to ignore ones sex drive, it's hard to ignore that basically everything revolves around sex.", "subreddit": "ForeverAlone"}

Not a single one. by really good, I simply mean the *high standard* of wanting someone dependable. Someone to be kind to me today, tomorrow and in the future, and just be a good person in general. I've just never really met anything like that. I don't know why it seems I'm the one that's cursed. I can look on FB and find any number of people, photos either alone or with friends and a high number of reacts. It seems everyone else in the world can find a friend next door, meanwhile I'm left waiting for just one person in the world to show an interest. I did suffer from social anxiety disorder for the first 21 years of my life and overcame it through ccbt in my 22 year. After that I thought \"Ok this is it. I will finally have friends, a girlfriend, and have a social life.\" Well, apparently I was too expectant as I can say 4 years after that that I have absolutely no one still.\n\nI do have 5 good online friends. I added them through FB and chat with them on messenger. I thought this was really good at the time. I could keep in contact with these people and keep the idea in my head that people can like me and be friendly with me. However, it's been a year since I've known them and things are still the same for me. It kind of encourage me to think, \"Oh this is all I'm going to get.\" I mean I love them but I obviously need physical people to touch/talk to/ have a life with.\n\nMy 5 online friends really are the best people I've ever met in my entire life. There's no question that their treatment of me greatly eclipses that of even my family, though that's not a particular feat. They are online and live on different continents than me, so it's not like I can ever feasibly see them. We all speak english (to varying degrees and the differences between them are so cute), so that's how we communicate. Thank god english is the most common language in the world.\n\nI had two \"friends\" in high school. However I haven't heard from them in x years so I definitely wouldn't claim them as anything. I would only claim real friendships that last and make an effort. This was not that obviously.\n\nEven at my last job, I tried making friends. It was a factory and it seemed everyone was having sex with each other, and I'm just over here, sexual and emotional needs left unmet. I don't know why I'm so different. I really don't but there seems to be something there. It wasn't just that job either, every job seemed to go that way. I always meet everyone with the same amount of respect until they give me a reason not to. I'm friendly and cordial to people and it just seems to get no results for me. And it does seem to be a particular problem with *me*, as I understand others can do that and make friends easily.\n\nI use an online dating app and maybe get responses from &lt;10% of the people I start a conversation with. And nothing has ever come of those responses. I really don't know what turns girls off about me, but the data seems to imply that girls in general do not see me as a sexual or emotional partner, or even as a friend. What a life right. I'd honestly rather be dead than accept that as its something I don't wanna keep living without. I know sample size is important but I really don't see any girl taking an interest in me for any reason. It shouldn't be this hard for a girl to think about giving me a chance.\n\nAs for who I am, well, I'm a fairly laid back person. I am a gamer, which I used to have shame about but now I realize its a totally common hobby (even among girls) so it can definitely be used as a point of mutual interest. I am fairly well kept. I keep a normal haircut, shave off my terrible cheek hair and well trim my chin hair. Slightly chubby but not obese. Overall I'd give myself a 4/10 but that's hardly a bad score and shouldn't factor in to making a friend or having a girlfriend. \n\nSo tell me guys. Whats up. Even tell me how I come across in my text. I am being completely honest and 100% real. I had hoped somebody would appreciate that, but it doesn't seem to be the case. Let me know.. really anything. Idk I'm just kinda done with the whole thing. I really don't see a person being friendly to me irl of their own free will.", "subreddit": "lonely"}

If nobody gives a crap about you, it's difficult to have positive feelings about yourself. \n\nDo you know what I did tonight? I sat here for four hours watching Youtube videos and reading posts here. I didn't go out with my significant other. I have no significant other. I didn't go out with my friends. I don't have any friends. I didn't talk to anyone online. Most of them meant well but I'm so toxic, I end up offending them. The only things I got up for were to use the bathroom and walk my dog. I even went on FAdating to make a few random joke posts recently. Trust me, I know I have no shot with any of them but I was bored. The last non-family member I talked to who wasn't an employee I don't even remember. If people cared about me, my evening would have gone differently. I know it's a two way street and my toxic personality makes it almost impossible to be a good friend even if I had a friend. People say I'm too hard on myself and the only person who thinks I'm all of these bad things is myself. Actually Mr. regular person, most of the negative thought in my head are from what people have told me. They are the voices of people who have put me down over the years. Since it's been over 10 years since I've had an in person friend, I only can remember the negatives. Okay Mr. normal person, I could have gone to the park. Actually I hurt myself being clumsy at work and I'm seeing a specialist tomorrow. Walking is difficult for me right now. You know what I did earlier in The Summer? Went to the park at sunset. I sat there alone looking at the couples and families interacting with each other. Eventually I got bored and walked home. Life isn't meant to be lived alone.\n\nYou people(not you other FA posters) think I can somehow think highly of myself when nobody else does. I want you to do something if you want to simulate the feeling that I have. Go five years without sex or a relationship. I don't want to go higher because I'm not that cruel. Also, you can't have any friends. If you go out, it's alone and people act like you are creepy. Your simulated autism will make you come off weird to people. Your simulated being ugly will make you disgusting to most people. At best you are a disposable acquaintance to someone who will ghost on you when they find someone better to take your place. I bet after six months you would start to feel the way I do. \n\nI've been accused of thinking I'm alone in my situation. I've been accused of thinking I'm special. I actually am special but not in that way. I'm so special I was in special classes. When nobody cares about you for an extended period of time, you start to not care about yourself. There are other FA'ers in similar situations. We are told with our mindset we will never escape FA. We need to put ourselves out there despite people not wanting to be approached by some unattractive, socially awkward, person when they are at a coffee shop or bar. They will always tell us we either didn't try hard enough or gave up too fast. These people have other people who care about them. Maybe they went through a phase where they were single for a couple of years. They think that makes them on the same level of FA as some of us. Not all of the regular people who post here are like that. It just gets annoying when people keep giving you the same generic advice thinking you haven't heard it 1,000 times.\n\nIf someone did care about me I would probably blow it anyway. I'm broken as a person. Having nobody who cares about you make your FA worse. Sucks for me I guess.", "subreddit": "ForeverAlone"}

He was nice to me and understanding mostly of my anxiety and depression. But today I think he just had enough of it. I\u2019m not fishing for sympathy, I just keep my head down and stay quiet.

(it's a reputable company don't worry, I would share the link but I don't wanna share my location I'm always paranoid about someone I know finding me).\n\nIt's a short shoot for an LGBT film and they offered overnight accommodation (it's 2 nights) for out-of-city folk but I've accepted it too because I can't wait to get away and meet people like me and just be myself, I keep fantasising about making friends or even a partner but I don't wanna set my hopes up too high. I keep packing and re-packing my bag over and over, and trying to figure out which of my clothes are the nicest, I wish it was tomorrow!\n\nThe problem is I still live at home \u2013 I'm 22 \u2013 and have parents who are extremely uncomfortable with my staying overnight at a strange place, i.e. it's not a hotel, it's the house that we're filming in. I get that it's scary but I've just spent far too long succumbing to my parents' will just so they're comfortable. I don't wanna sound like some rebellious angsty teenager but in my mind the fact is I need to start taking more risks. I've succumbed to my parents' anxieties about me for far too long, I even stayed in the same city to study for university, I abandoned so many other opportunities! And they still think me doing that was good for me!\n\nAnd this isn't even a massive risk, the film company have safeguarding policies and it's a legitimate project. They keep saying they trust me, but if they really did then they would let me make my own decisions, especially at 22, but my parents think my age is irrelevant, I can't authorise my own decisions until I move out, which I can't do until I'm married. To a man, and yes I'm female, which should trigger the conversation about my sexuality except that's never gonna happen, what I'm hoping for at best is to send them a letter when I'm living far, far away from here.

But yeah she's very homophobic. I had to lie to her and convince her it's nothing to do with LGBT stuff (\"you read it wrong, every company does pro-LGBT stuff nowadays it doesn't mean anything\") because she was getting so stressed, and it deeply stresses me out too when they're stressed, I try to avoid it and tell myself they're being irrational but that just doesn't work, I'm emotionally bound to them.\n\nI'm planning on going regardless of whether I have their permission but I don't think they know that yet. I really think me telling them about this and being so defiant about it is the scariest thing I've ever done. But I'm sick of being lonely, and I'm sick of feeling like I'm not free.

And I can't fucking believe you somehow managed to get back with her and get her laid during her fucking sister's fucking funeral.\n\nWhile you fuckers are so demanding you hardly give a shit when I needed help.\n\n I'm tired of this crap and I'm not even paid for this damn thing.

This has been a source of such pain for me over the years as I see my sisters, or people around me have friendships so easily. I've lost count over the times I've cried over being lonely. But I never seem to want to actually hang out with some of the potential friends, I like my own company, but feel so loney and like I need friends. catch-22. Either I had best friends growing up that I completely drifted apart from. Or in Uni I made some friends but either feel like deep down they don't like me or I actually don't even feel the want to hang out with them as I always feel I have to impress them etc.   \n\n\nI'm 25 now and would say I have about 2-3 close friends here in the UK. I recently started a new job where I made a good friend, however the friendship deteriorated quickly and I ended up quitting my job and moving home because I felt out of place in the office and decided just to give up the job and go travelling/teach abroad.   \n\n\nThat was 4 months ago and fast forward to now and I've saved \u00a34,000 and completed my TEFL course, ready to go travelling with my boyfriend and then settle in Taiwan to teach for a year, maybe more.   \n\n\nHowever, yesterday I had this pang of fear. That going away for such an extended time would mean I lost any of the connections I have here in the UK. I know there is one person I could pick up where I left off with in the UK but the others will probably drop off so when I do come back to the UK again, I will be even more lonely. And as it's getting harder and harder to make close friends as I age, this may result in me being more depressed and lonely.   \n\n\nHowever I don't know if I should just do the travelling 3 months and not teach abroad but come back to the UK so I can get back to a job and cultivate my friendships a bit more. Obviously travelling is incredible, and living abroad, but if it's going to result in me feeling even worse when I do return, is it a smart move?  \n\n\nI know you could say I could meet even more amazing people abroad/when I'm teaching. However when I'm with m boyfriend we are very just a 1 on 1 kind of couple and don't really get a friendship group around us. I would probably have to go out of my way to spend less time with him to make the connections and would find myself just hanging out with him as it's easier.

I never had any real friends in high school. Just a few people i ate lunch w/ its a very conservative area and about 1/3 the population is ultra conservitive (lds) i was raised in this religion but became a closet atheist my senior year. From there i just wanted to run away and start over. So i went to university in the UK with the goal of makeing just one friend. First semester was really rough i arrived almost 3 weeks late (visa), 4 of my flatmates didn't want anything to do w me the 5th and i seemed to hit it off but she would always say we would go out or that she would introduce me to people but never did (there's a bit more drama there but whatever) i tried meeting people in lectures and workshops. Met some cool people in one but it was just like highschool, friends of circumstance once the project was done it was back to waving as we passed by. Living in student housing didn't help. Alone in a tiny room. Listening to other people haveing fun at dozens of parties and pres. Accross the complex while you sit there trying to tune it out. Desperately trying to work on assignments just to forget about how empty i feel, go sit in the shower carving words in my skin. Or I'd just leave and wonder around the city at night just hopeing that something might happen. Idk. When winter break came it was nearly a month long.  i hadn't planned on going home for christmas but i was seriously starting to loose my shit. So i came home for a month, still nofriends at home but being with family helped. I very seriously considered staying home. But i decided to try again with a fresh look at semester two. A fresh crew of international students came in and was able to squirm my way into a fb group where i was able to make plans, travel more and meet people, amd yes i think i actually made a few friends. Plus i tried really hard, joined some clubs, met some people who might of actually hung out and even tried flirting with a few girls, (screwed up with the ladies tho cuz I'm a genuine idiot). Anyway it was allot better. ( still had some rought times tho) And i would have had a few friends had i gone back. Unfortunately my accademic preformance was not good. Lets just say that university isn't for me, so yeah I'm back home living w mom and dad. Without any friends i trying to get a job but honestly the thought of working at most places leave a hole in my stomach. I'm trying to get a job somewhere with allot of people working but just so i can try makeing friends. I don't have my own car rn so going places to meet people can be a bit difficult unless its at church. Theres a group of athiests that meet every sunday but i cant go because its at a time when i don't have access to a car. Thats really the only good thing about europe , everything is close. I dunno i was just sitting here   scrolled through insta, then i went to tinder to see if i matched w anyone but hontly don't know what people want from that app. I just want to have coffee w someone and have a convo. But basicly never get a response from anyone. Then i went to pintrest and just got thinking and now I'm  at the lowest I've been since i got home, i just keep hopeing things will get better but nights like these you just can't help but wonder, maybe they won't.

I feel like I have no one to bounce my ideas off of or share my feelings with so I'll hop on here to find posts that I find relate-able. I wanted to finally make a post because I don't know what else to do.  I just needed to put this somewhere.\n\nI had a realization today that when I was 20 I told myself that by the time I was 25 I would be in a long term relationship with someone I'd marry. I am now nearly three months away from turning 26 and I have not been in a serious stable relationship in 6 years. Im not attractive, im short for a guy, I'm overweight, my voice isn't deep so I know the on logically level I have very few traits that other women would find desirable. and besides having a job and transportation I still feel like im loser since the job doesn't pay well and I often times dont have the money to treat people to things.  But, I still believed that I would be able to pull it off since I've had a few girlfriends in the past. Even though all of them dumped me, I thought I would do okay since they lasted awhile.\n\nBut so far, no luck. So I ask myself if I should still be optimistic about my chances ? Should I say...okay well lets shoot for the big 30 for a good relationship? I dont know. I've tried a lot to put myself out there. I've even fallen in love about two years ago for a girl. But she doesn't love me at all, in fact she told me that the idea of being with me disgusted her. I've been on dating sites but I've had people take the time to message me and call me ugly or straight up ignore my messages when I try to strike up a convo. Which is okay, I get it..I can take a hint. I have no confidence to go out in public places becuase I feel if people think im ugly online then it's going to be the same reaction. I always get told I have a good personalty but it's never enough.\n\nIm still young, so this is the best Im ever going to look and as healthy as Im ever going to be. So now im getting scared, that the older I get the more impossible it's going to be. I've been thinking that some people aren't meant to find a partner and have a soul mate. I've had people tell me they'd date me, but there's always a reason why they dont. I've had people say I deserve love but never tell me why. I think about finding someone I can spend the rest of my life with, someone I can share my thoughts and feelings with. But I dont have that at all. Sometimes I wonder if I ever did becuase everyone I've tried that with left eventually. In a room full of strangers I'd blend in, no one notice me, I wouldn't catch anybody's eye. It's always been that way, but it's worst now than it's ever been. My biggest fear is that once my parents go I won't have anyone that loves me at all. I haven't been intimate with anyone in a long time and I dont even know what it's like to be held or to hold someone.\n\nI dont remember what it feels like to have someone truly interested in you. I've never had someone who truly accepted me for who I am, who loved me and never wanted to let me go. Everyone's broken up with me and I cant help but feel I am the problem. I guess I cant really make relationships work..Im not good at them.

I\u2019ve never needed someone to just \u2018hang out\u2019, I like to spend time with people I have something in common with, if you get what I mean.. who share interests with me beside the need to drink a beer with someone but... since I broke up with my boyfriend, after we spent together 17 years, all those I considered real friends just disappeared because me and my boyfriend weren\u2019t there to plan a night out anymore and they chose to keep his friendship over mine, I guess.\n\nThen three years ago I found a new job and I met this colleague... she was 27, just 6 years younger than me, but she was very insicure and her friends treated her badly. She had no self esteem but she was sweet and I immediately tried to help her, inviting her to hang out with me, I complimented her to help with her self esteem, I shared my interests to help her to find something that could make her feel stronger, more confident, and I tried my best to be with her when she needed someone to talk to. I thought I finally had found a best friend - I know it sound childish but I\u2019m so envious of those who have this kind of friendship! - but recently she got herself a boyfriend, she grew more confident, she reconnected with her friends... and I realized suddenly that I\u2019m no longer needed, and I am alone. \n\nWhen me and my boyfriend broke up I thought that at least I still had friends to hang out with, it broke my heart because I still love him unfortunately, but I was so sure that I\u2019d never feel lonely, that I\u2019d always have someone to hang out with.... that now I don\u2019t know what to do.

When they hang out, it's always with her door closed. So now, I am left with no friends.\n\nI hate walking around campus and seeing other girls with their friends walking around and then there's just me. I've done so much to try to find my place on campus. I'm in a social organization, I lead an organization that I started, and I am part of another club. I talk to people in my classes. I try so hard to be social but no one wants to hang out with me or talk to me. \n\nIt's gotten to the point where all I do is complete my mandatory things for the day that I can't do from my bed and then I go home and get in bed. I sit there for probably 5 hours before I go to bed. I don't have anyone to talk to and I just feel so shitty that I isolate myself because I don't want to bring other people into this funk I've been in for the past month. I have tried everything and am so desperate for someone to hang out with (I hide it well apparently). \n\nDoes anyone have any suggestions or advice? Please help, I can't take the crippling loneliness anymore.  Thanks in advance.", "subreddit": "lonely"}

Gen. Z knows how to make up terms. The past two days had reminders of something I never got to or will never experience because I'm ugly and autistic.\n\nFirst I was in a pharmacy getting a prescription. The woman ahead of me had two little girls and they weren't misbehaving but actually causing people to interact with them. The woman looked to be around my age. She was pregnant with another child. The girls said daddy and ran over to their dad who was probably surprising them by meeting them there. Judging by his clothes I assumed he was coming home from work. He looked to be in his late 30's or early 40's. He said hey kids and they hugged him. He kissed her briefly on the lips. I was next and the cashier said how seeing that was causing her to become emotional. I saw that family and realized, I'm never going to be that guy coming home from a job that provides financial security because I'm a loser. I will never have kids because that would mean a woman would have to find me attractive.\n\nToday I went to a local convenience store. It was crowded with people ordering from the prepped food area. I was in line to order on the machine when I saw a couple on one of the machines. They both looked to be in their early 20's. The guy was below average looking and the woman was also conventionally unattractive but they were in love. I could also tell both had a mental disorder. He had her hands around her and after they ordered they walked around the store holding hands. That was supposed to be me in my early 20's! I was supposed to find someone at that age. I tried but failed. It was the cheesy type of PDA that I would do with my non-existent girlfriend.

But, does that mean I don't want to have what normal people take for granted? No. Just because I value the importance of being myself i.e. having my own style, interests, hobbies, way of speaking etc., it does not mean I don't want to have the basics in life too. But, I guess being yourself instead of submitting to robotic, mediocre, social norms and interests just to be socially validated has its consequences. \n\nWhat's wrong with being myself and still being able to do the things that the majority of the population do such as:\n\n* Forming intimate relationships (with so much ease)\n* Being able to have hookups whilst 'seeking a relationship', sort of like looking for a permanent job whilst your are temping\n* Maintaining and expanding social circles\n* Being able to get a job without HR negatively judging the way you talk and what you like because you don't fit social expectations\n* Lessened or even nonexistent mental health problems such as anxiety and depression\n* Learning things easily the first time your are taught, shown or you read about, rather than only 'getting it' weeks later\n\nAnd, I guess there is more.\n\nIs this too much too ask? What other people take from granted, I don't have. That is probably because normal people realise that they and the majority of people do have the 'basics' in life, which they then perceive as an expectation of everybody they meet.

I didnt make more friends nearing the end of high school because I figured I already had a good group and that's personally enough for me. Me and my girlfriend broke up due to her just having some mental health problems that just made, along with other things, being in a relationship difficult, I won't go into more detail into that for her own personal privacy. But we broke it off romantically and agreed to just be best friends. And honestly, it was easier for me as well just being friends, so it was kinda nice. But last week she told me she doesn't want to be best friends anymore and that she regrets making ME promise her we'd always be best friends and that we should just be friends. But she's also become so nonexistent in my life at this point I'm lucky if we even hang out once a week.

Not why she was avoiding me, if she was even mad at me, nothing. It seemed like thing would get extra bad if I stayed and pressed, so I backed off and left. A few days later the anxiety and grief were so bad once again that I messaged her through a few different places to try to tell her how awful I felt and that I needed her. She was mad, and understandably so. If I was thinking rationally I probably wouldn\u2019t have done what I did and I regret it. Still, she refused to explain to me what her reasoning or motives were and I was left defeated. \n\nI still love her so much. I worry about her health and her wellbeing, I wanna see her succeed, and I still care about her so much. I wanna tell her how I feel but I don\u2019t know what to do. Things have gotten slightly better over the past couple of weeks. We\u2019ve had a few good interactions, and have sat at the same table with friends twice now, but she still seems slightly uncomfortable and once people start to leave she leaves as quickly as she can. Losing my love is one thing, but losing one of my best friends is something completely different. I really don\u2019t have many people to talk to about this. All my friends in college I\u2019m either not very close to, or aren\u2019t very free. I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever felt this alone and it sucks.", "subreddit": "lonely"}

Best example, the one and only date I've ever been on was about a year ago, she was a really lovely person and I was just so awkward, partly stemming from my anxiety was so high I, at some points, was struggling to comprehend what she was saying. Needless to say I assumed she had no intention of seeing me again and I don't blame her.\n\nSince then, I've been afraid of going on a date ever again. I know that if I'm to succeed on a date, I need to better myself - I need to make myself someone who's enjoyable to be around.

And I should probably lose my jaded perception of society, humanity, and the future of civilization while I'm at it.\n\nAnd then, only after doing all of that and going on some actual dates with people, I can finally grow to have an understanding of the kind of partner I want, so I can have an actual healthy long term relationship with someone.\n\nHas anyone had success with overcoming this?

It\u2019s a bit different to probably many of the stories on here but I\u2019m stumped if I know where else to post this.

I have a female friend that is sadly taken who is like this, that is everything in a female I\u2019ve ever wanted but cannot have. My biggest fear is that I\u2019m going to end up with the exact opposite of that and never get to experience any of what I want to. worse yet the guy she\u2019s with is about as vanilla as it\u2019s gets. he has everything I have ever wanted in a female and yet he waste\u2019s what I have wanted my whole life. Knowing my luck I\u2019ll end up with some vanilla church going female who if I even mention something remotely fun she\u2019ll tell me she \u201cisn\u2019t into that\u201d and \u201cisn\u2019t that type of girl\u201d. Better yet, the girl I end up with will probably be one of those dreadful \u201csex after marriage\u201dtypes. Because by the time I find a girlfriend the only ones that will be left are the ones all the other guys don\u2019t want. The female pool will have been well picked over. If it hasn\u2019t already. So for me it\u2019ll be a case of \u201cthis is what\u2019s left every other girl has been taken\u201d. The only ones left will be either \u201cwe get married first then have tame, mellow sex and don\u2019t do anything remotely fun\u201d, or worse yet \u201cthe completely vanilla type girl\u201d who won\u2019t do anything remotely kinky or be into anything I am and will shut me down every opportunity. These left over girls will be about as fun as wiping your ass with sandpaper. What\u2019s even worse is every girl who has ticked every box and is into everything I am or does, wears what I love is either taken or doesn\u2019t like me.

Mostly primary school aged. \n\nI've tried really hard to maintain friendships. I've gone out my way to fit in with their new lives. I've remembered all their children's birthdays and travelled to meet the baby, etc. This effort hasn't been reciprocated though. I just feel they have all moved on. It hurts a lot that years of friendship have been lost. \n\nMy husband hasn't suffered a similar fate. His friends still see him occasionally...not as often granted...but they do catch up. He doesn't even have to make a huge effort. A few texts and it is all arranged. Seems Dad's aren't as tied up as Mum's. I get that. This is why when I've contacted female friends I always offer to go to theirs or meet at a cafe or do something child friendly. They always have other plans. \n\nIt hurts a lot to be honest.

I won't look at old photos now as I just end up crying. \n\nWe have a few couples we see now and then...joint friends...this is nice...but we don't see them often as they live a long way away.

Closest thing I've done to doing something with a chick was dancing with one or two at a night club (and by dancing I mean grinding). I mean, it was really cool and all, but I've still yet to experience something as basic even kissing or cuddling or some shit.\n\nI kinda blame myself for the most part tho cuz I used to be a Nice Guy^tm up until a year ago. A couple of life-changing experiences have forced me to confront my toxic personality issues. I've definitely improved since then, as I've been able to make more friends, reconcile with some of the friends I've hurt as a Nice Guy, strengthen the connections with friends I already have, and even just be more in the moment more often. \n\nHowever, I still struggle to not relapse back into my old creepy, entitled, passive-aggressive attitude that has caused me and the people I've affected so much pain and strife. It gets so hard to fight at times, especially when the desire to feel the warmth of another person laying close next to me becomes too unbearable for me to handle, when I start to question why I can't just bring myself to ask someone out without looking like a god damn creep. \n\nThen I start to think about how everyone else that I know is already starting to make something of their own lives while I still don't even know how to drive or land a job, let alone produce anything of real value. I keep thinking that people see that in me, that despite my sense of humor and insights into certain facets of life, that I should be kept at arms length because of my inability to produce anything of pragmatic value in the short term.\n\nThen the paranoia and the crippling feelings of isolation take over, and I start to wish there was someone to lay down next to me and tell me everything's okay. \n\nLike, I know I need to be stronger, that I need to focus on myself first and foremost and all that jazz. But sometimes it feels like I've been in cooking in the oven for too long, and by the time I'm \"ready\", I'll just be burnt to a crisp before being thrown in the trash. \n\nI just...I just want someone I can hold and watch horror movies from the 80s and 90s with while getting high a couple of times or something.

Just a lonely guy who has never had anyone who loved him back. I feel like just getting it out there might ease the pain a bit, so why not? First things first, im 19 and quickly approaching 20. I\u2019ve had a handful of romantic encounters over the last few years, but all have led basically nowhere. All except maybe a single relationship that lasted 3 months (which i will admit, was healthy, but barely fulfilling).\n\nThe first encounter was a long distance one. We met online and liked each other a lot. We were young and stupid like all teens, so we took it as far as planning a future together. Big mistake. A couple months in and communication got less frequent. It ended stale. We still talk sometimes and have since put the past behind us.\n\nSome time later I met someone else online, but this time a lot closer to me. We hit it off and met up a few times. We were really into each other but never started an official relationship. Looking back, she was emotionally unavailable and could never agree to anything. I had my first kiss with her, but that was all. We cut things off a year and a half ago, and we haven\u2019t spoken since. I hope it stays that way, and here\u2019s why:\n\nThis may very well be the person I\u2019ve given my most dedication to. In a way, I looked up to her because of how she had overcome her broken past. She seemed like a strong person, and i wanted to give her everything she deserved for it. I listened, I comforted, and I spoiled. To an extent, she did, too, but not very much. After pouring my heart out on this woman and having her cut me off despite it, I was left emotionally scarred. I no longer know if I have genuine feelings for someone because of how guarded I\u2019ve become. I noticed this last summer when I thought I had feelings for an old friend of mine.\n\nWe\u2019ve known each other since middle school, throughout which I cared for her a lot. We were best friends in high school even though we didn\u2019t go to the same one. Still, though, we were close. Before I left for college, I wanted to spend more time with her and so I regularly visited her house. We opened up about our love lives, and found out we liked each other around the end of middle school. She had been struggling with her unofficial partner recently, and i helped as much as I could. They stopped talking that summer when the guy did something she didn\u2019t like, so i had to step in and comfort her because of it.\n\nWe shared a couple of romantic moments that summer as we grew closer, but stopped talking altogether while I was at college. She could not get over the other guy, and I can\u2019t blame her. Sometimes I think about how it would have turned out if I had stayed, but it hurts to think about. I don\u2019t know if I ruined a friendship, but I\u2019ve definitely put distance between us. \n\nThis leads to my freshman year of college. At the end of our second quarter (a highly flawed calendar system that benefits only the institution, by the way), I met someone who I immediately thought I\u2019d be a good match with. We were both single, so I asked her out and after a few dates she became my girlfriend. As I said before, it was a healthy relationship. She was loving and i was nothing short of the same. Around the end of the year, though, things changed. We became more distant and it was obvious that she didn\u2019t feel the same anymore. She cut things off. We don\u2019t talk anymore.\n\nAs she broke up with me, one of the things she said was that I fall in love too easily. I thought about it, and i do think its true. I think my romantic past has made me desperate for affection to the point where I don\u2019t know if I truly have feelings for someone or I\u2019m just taking what i can get. It frustrates the hell out of me and I can\u2019t help but think the rest of my love life, if there is one at all, will come down to second guessing my feelings. \n\nThat\u2019s all, and if you\u2019ve read this far, thank you. From the bottom of my heart, thank you. And if anyone has experienced something similar, I\u2019m happy to talk about it or anything at all. Im here for y\u2019all.

Get involved in more social settings, work, study, entertainment or whatever and it'd better be somewhere where you have to communicate a lot; try to work as a barman or waiter if necessary, just communicate and acquire more social skills. With time you'll be able to understand people more and read them easily. You'll also be more fun, friendly and easy to talk to, which will make people want to spend time with you. You'll be also able to see how people perceive you so that you can work on improving how you are perceived. I know doing this is not so easy, I understand how childhood or teenage experiences can fuck up a person. But it's possible. \n\nSo yeah, besides being attractive and having masculine traits and attitude, being funny, socially smart and unique in some way or another is more or at least as important. It seems to me that reducing all of your problems to how you look like is just another defence-mechanism that is doing nothing to you but making your situation worse, as you are not fixing the real problems you have. OF COURSE LOOKS MATTER SO MUCH, I'm not denying that but I'm just saying there's more to it. \n\nI know this might seem as some blue-billed basic advice, but it really works. You should let people see the great qualities you have and being too self-conscious, focusing on your flaws and shortcomings, and constantly worrying about what people would think of you would not help you AT ALL. It would only make things worse as you would look unapproachable, distant, aloof, negatively weird and all that which will make people not so willing to talk to you. \nHaving large social circles would help you know new girls who have the same interests or hobbies, and this is way better than approaching random girls just because of their appearance. It is easier as well. \n\nYou might also want to consider smiling a little more (that resting bitch face!). I swear smiling is so necessary. I mean stop worrying so much just let it go. Start more conversations with the people you know and don't know. Dress nicely and looksmax as much as you can.\n\nA final tip that helped me personally is this: Find some good actor, comedian, public speaker, or whomever you find influential, charming, funny or charismatic.

One time I was on the treadmill and was doing my cool down walk and this blond haired girl got on the one right next to mine and even though I noticed her out of the corner of my eye, immediately I became nervous and tried to focus on anything else but her and in my head I was thinking, \"Oh damn, is she gonna look at me? Is she going to talk to me?\" I kinda wanted her too, hoping she might also find me interesting enough to notice, but then I remembered who I was and what I looked like and realized never in a million years would she ever strike up a conversation with me and of course no more than a few minutes later a guy much better built and better looking than me whisked her away. \n\nThe inner turmoil I feel about this is so damning I'll pantomime putting my Beretta BB gun in my mouth, cocking the hammer and thinking \"Ahh, there we go!\" Of course I'm too much of a chickenshit to ever do something like this for real (again at least) but it makes me feel better for just that split second.", "subreddit": "ForeverAlone"}

It's settled.  I am officially going on my first date ever at 27 years old.  I decided to pull the trigger and ask if she wanted to meet up, as the gaps between responses were getting longer and longer with each passing day.  We had already spoken for close to two weeks and I was worried that the conversation was getting stale/she was losing interest. She enthusiastically agreed, and we've just finished coordinating where/when we would meet up (this weekend).  \n\nThere is a small pit in my stomach right now.  It contains a mixture of excitement and nervousness.  I imagine this pit will grow throughout the week and eventually dominate my thoughts completely.  I have a great deal of preparation to do this week to help with the nerves and maximize my chances of success.\n\nThe first thing I will do is visit the shop where we agreed to meet. I'll scout out the parking, see if there is anything on the menu I like in particular, etc...  I'll probably do this today after work. \n\nI'll also try to look up information related to \"date etiquette\".  Should I go for a handshake or hug when we first meet?  How should I navigate the bill?  What do to when the date ends/ how to handle the prospect of a date continuation?  And so forth...\n\nThe third thing I will do is try to address probably my greatest fear:  Awkward silences and not knowing what to say/ask.  I've collected a great deal of information from her profile and our conversations.  There were details in her profile that I purposely avoided talking about specifically for this scenario.  There are also topics from our online conversations that can be expanded upon.  I will compile this information into a spreadsheet and study it thoroughly so that I can always have something segue into if the current topic is getting stale.  I'm genuinely curious about these topics, by the way.  I'm not approaching this like some robot processing data.  This is mostly to help me remember everything.\n\nAll in all, I think I have a pretty good game plan.  If I do my homework, this is likely to be an enjoyable experience for both of us.  Hopefully it will lead to a second date and beyond.  I like this woman a lot and am fairly invested at this point.

Children, of course, begin life with an untarnished sense of wonder, a capacity to experience total joy at something as simple as the greenness of a leaf; but as they grow older, the awareness of death and decay begins to impinge on their consciousness and subtly erode their joie de vivre (a keen enjoyment of living), their idealism \u2014 and their assumption of immortality.\n\nAs a child matures, he sees death and pain everywhere about him, and begins to lose faith in the ultimate goodness of man. But if he\u2019s reasonably strong \u2014 and lucky \u2014 he can emerge from this twilight of the soul into a rebirth of life\u2019s \u00e9lan (enthusiastic and assured vigor and liveliness).\n\nBoth because of and in spite of his awareness of the meaninglessness of life, he can forge a fresh sense of purpose and affirmation. He may not recapture the same pure sense of wonder he was born with, but he can shape something far more enduring and sustaining.\n\nThe most terrifying fact about the universe is not that it is hostile but that it is indifferent; but if we can come to terms with this indifference and accept the challenges of life within the boundaries of death \u2014 however mutable man may be able to make them \u2014 our existence as a species can have genuine meaning and fulfillment. However vast the darkness, we must supply our own light\". \n\nSo remember: try to pour some light into your life, no matter how dark it is. All the best to all of you.", "subreddit": "lonely"}

I guess I\u2019m just feeling an overwhelming amount of loneliness. I\u2019ve actually been alone my entire life and I\u2019m quite used to this feeling; I usually have the willpower to just wait for it to pass. But I can feel myself breaking.\n\nAfter trying unsuccessfully to find someone after searching through online dating apps and through real life interactions, I came to the realization that the vast majority of women around me aren\u2019t interested in me. It seems like women are looking for things I cannot about myself; I wasn\u2019t able to get a single date. And also that it was becoming unhealthy to spend so much time and energy thinking about finding companionship. It seems like I was searching for the tiniest grain of sand in the largest of oceans. I realized that there is a good chance that I could spend my entire life searching and still come out empty handed. Instead of putting myself through that, I figured I should try and find happiness in other places where I can actually see progress. I gave up searching completely, but sometimes, the soul crushing weight of being alone is just hard to fight through. \n\nDo you guys deal with anything similar? How do you cope with it? I just want to move forward and not have my mind so clouded all the time. Thank you for reading.", "subreddit": "lonely"}

It's not against anyone. It's just how reality is. When I was in my late teens and early 20's, social media was just starting. Online dating was something the fringe minority did. Hookup apps didn't exist. I never had success I'm ugly and autistic. if I was a guy that age now, hookup apps and online dating becoming mainstream, you are having to compete not just with guys from your school or town but many more guys who also have the hookup app. You are also now competing with more older guys my age. Guys my age and older usually have more financial security are normally people they wouldn't interact with but not they do. That does explain why the number of FA guys in their 20's is rising sharply. Do any of you guys in that age range agree or disagree? \n\nI know some people may think I'm labeling women that age as women just looking for good looking and wealthy guys. I don't think that. I know most people still aren't FA including guys in that age range. I was just sitting here and was thinking, when I was that age, I had a bad experience. People still met on the internet and made friends over the internet in the early to mid 2000's but social media didn't exist like we know it now. My oneitis rejected me for a much older guy with money. With dating and hookup apps, I wonder how much more difficult it is to attempt dating or hookups. I know FA women face challenges too and I hope I'm not offending any of them with my post.", "subreddit": "ForeverAlone"}

I was the youngest of my family, and I was left alone with them often. My sisters hated me for some reason. They would beat me up and make me cry and things like that. They never got punished. The second worse thing they did to me was force me to cross dress, and then snap the straps of the bra they made me wear, and take pictures of it to use as blackmail. This was punishment for accidentally snapping one of their bra straps. When I started middle school, they became interested in my sexual activities. They told me that I need to start masturbating and liking girls. They would joke about how I wanted to have sex with the family pets because I wouldn't tell them about the girls I was interested. One day, I was in the basement of my Dad's townhouse with my sister, and she just took off her shirt for no reason. I looked away, and she came up and started rubbing herself on me. I told her to stop, and it made me uncomfortable. I never told my Dad, my sisters never got punished for anything anyway.\n\nThey stopped picking on me when my brother died, but by that time I was in high school, and other girls picked up the slack. When I was a freshman, I had trouble making eye contact with people. There was a girl who would always talk to me and try to get close to me and stuff like that. I guess she liked me, but it made me uncomfortable. One day she wore a low-cut shirt, revealing her breast, and came face to face with me. I couldn't look her in the eyes, and I couldn't look at her breasts, so I just looked away. I bought her a chocolate bar for Christmas because she was one of my only friends.\n\nBy senior year, I had made a few friends with girls. They liked to make dirty jokes, and I did too, so I made a few. I also had a crush on one of them, so I was giving her complements and saying romantic stuff. She started dating one of my friends, and she told me that she thought I was a creep, so he told me to stop talking to her. She also went to the assistant principal about my dirty jokes. I got in trouble and started crying. My mom picked me up and told everyone I hit my head so no one would know the truth. Most of the girls I was friends with started acting hostile towards me, but when I fought back I got yelled at, and that made me cry too. I went to the school's office to leave, and this strange girl started hugging me for no reason. That all happened less than a year ago.\n\nThese days, I browse Incel forums. I post sometimes about how women are evil and all that stuff. It used to be because of catharsis, but now it's just because Incels are the only community where I feel accepted. There isn't any feeling, besides desperation. I still feel alone, because I am alone. I tried killing myself 4 times. The last time I did, someone called the cops. I don't know who, but they're gone now anyway. I go to therapy and I'm prescribed pills and I take them, but they don't really seem to be working. I'm tired of being bitter and lonely. I want to abandon the Incel community forever, but I don't know where else to go. I don't want to be hateful and bitter. Even after everything, I still want a girlfriend, but it's like I'm already dead to all the girls at my college. I'm not even ugly, just plain looking.\n\nI don't know why I made this post, and I know I'm breaking the rules by using the \"I\"-word, and I'm sorry. I just want to see if anyone understands.

And it\u2019s gonna be a long story , that feels (at least for me) as if it was gotten from a movie , but no . It actually happened . \n\nWhen I was a toddler , I had a Russian nanny . She was super sweet and nice . She even always considered me her grandson (even though we are not connected in any way) . That granny had a granddaughter , who was actually around my age . Maybe half a year older . We were best friends at that time . Always together . \n\nYear later , that granny needed to move back to Russia . Of course , with her granddaughter . \n\nNow , a bit about my family . My father is a heavy drinker and mother is very narcissistic . They both neglected me . \nThe only good memories I had were memories of me spending time with the granny and her granddaughter . \n\nNow I\u2019m about 8 years old . I got very fat for my age . I never enjoyed sports , so I never went out of my apartment except for school and when parents needed to take me for something . \nThe only entertainment I had were TV and my computer . And of course , the memories of me being a toddler (I have a good memory , so don\u2019t be surprised) \n\nNow I\u2019m 13 . Me and my family moved to another country . I lost all of my friends (3 people , just so you know) . Now is the time my parents forced me to go outside by myself , \u201cplay\u201d or \u201changout\u201d with friends . My social skills are at 0(even now . I literally can not start a conversation with anyone, whom I don\u2019t know) . Because they forced me to go out , it didn\u2019t help me to become more sociable . \nSo I still entertain myself with TV and video games . And of course , sweet memories . \n\nYear later , surprise . I lost weight . I became very tall , but skinny . I never really played any sport at that point , so understandable why . \nBut again , my parents now were expecting me to play sports and enjoy them , while I was actually scared of getting hit with the ball , or just getting hurt .\nWhat\u2019s my leisure ? Video games , TV and memories . \n\nHowever surprise , summer time . Me , my sis and my mom decided to go on vacation . To Russia ! I could finally meet the girl I\u2019ve been thinking about for so long ! \nWe finally are at the place where we were supposed to meet our old family friends .\nAnd then I see her .\nShe sat down right in front of me . \nWe started talking , talking , laughing , talking . \nAnd suddenly , she started flirting . \nI got very surprised and because of my lack of sociability , I couldn\u2019t really keep up the dialogue , so we went quiet . \nBut I never forgot that moment . \n\nNow I\u2019m 16 . Still skinny , but a lot better then I was before . I\u2019ve been practicing my social skills , just so this time I would be able to keep up the conversation . \nI also started to educate myself a lot . Reading books , finding interesting facts . \nI became one of the smartest kids in my school . \nWhy ? Because I got a new sweet memory , which made me fall in love with that girl . And I wanted to be better . For her . \n\nSummer . Again . \nNow we went to the sea . \nBut surprise , our old family friends decided that this time they will join us . \nI knew that my love would come as well . \nI was really excited about it .\nOur whole stay I tried to mostly talk to her in private . And it was fun , really fun . \nAnd now comes the departure day.....I get her phone number , say my farewells and.....confess how I feel about her . After she\u2019s done listening and she realized I\u2019m serious , I kissed her . On the cheek though , as I was not brave enough . \nNow I didn\u2019t need to think about old memories ! I found love ! Right ?......right !?........\n\nApparently no . \nI kept chatting with her , everyday . \nBut one week later she said that she is busy right now studying for university exams .\nSo I said okay and stopped chatting with her . \nShe said she will text me when she\u2019ll be free . \nDays passed , nothing .\nWeeks , nothing . \nMonths , nothing . \nNext week I know , she blocked me . \n\nI was really sad , but optimistic . Maybe she blocked me just so I wouldn\u2019t distract her ? \nHere comes new year , 2018 . We are in Russia , just for a day , because we got a connection flight to go to . \nAgain , I expect her to come and see us , see me . But nothing .\nI ask her cousin why she is not responding me . \nAnswer of the cousin destroyed me . \n\u00abYou didn\u2019t know ? She hates you . Because Granny thought you were her only grandson , she spent most of her time with you . She literally thinks you stole her grandmother and she truly hate you\u00bb......\n.............so much for nothing , eh ? \n......heh.........\n\nAnd here I am now . I am 17 for the time being and will turn 18 soon . \nAfter that , I really couldn\u2019t try and talk to another girl .\nI am still trying my hardest to be educated (I just started my uni) , but.....this memory......haunts me . \n\nMy whole life I thought \u201cthat\u2019s it !

I thought I\u2019ll spend the rest of my life with her , but......heh . \nLife is unfair , isn\u2019t it ? \nI tried to get into a relationship 2 more time (both of which are the stories for another time . ) . \nBut here I am , writing it all to \u201clonely\u201d subreddit . \nI still want to live a happy life in the future with a daughter , but......it really seems that I can\u2019t .

{"post_id": "d5hutc", "created_utc": 1568730880, "title": "How to suffer less.", "author": "ambisinister_sloth", "self_text": "Hello there fellow loners and outcasts. I'm a person with asperger's who has a hard time with other people daily, I used to think I belonged here, but here's the catch, I don't think I do. And here's how you don't have to either. I hope my advice doesn't seem overdone to you, I used to come here a lot two years ago and I know what you guys are allergic to, this place used to be way darker, grittier and more tight-knit when I was active here.\n\nStep 1 - **Leave this place.** I know this might sound preachy, but for real, try to stop coming here as much as you do, limit your time here and stop eventually, I've done this back in the day and I started getting better psychologically almost right after I left. I know it's hard to say goodbye to your only friends here, but by only talking to people as miserable as you, you'd be sabotaging the next step. By being here you descend deeper and deeper into the rabbithole.\n\nStep 2 - **Learn how to suffer stoically.** Again, I hope this doesn't sound preachy, I know life is pain, but try reading a book on stoicism, I did and it sure helped me, you can start right now, with Marcus Auresius's Meditations, the whole book is available [online for free] (http://classics.mit.edu/Antoninus/meditations.html), legitimately. Stoicism is a philosophy that focuses on getting into a mindset that minimizes suffering and teaches you how to be a good person. It won't guarantee you happiness or someone to cuddle at night, but it sure is wisdom. The basic thing it teaches is that reality cannot hurt you, it's always your perception of it. I know it sounds very r/thanksimcured and it doens't always help, I still get the blues too, I still have trouble believing in better future, but knowing this sure helps me on my brighter days. You can come to r/stoicism if you need help with where to start, people there should help you.\n\nStep 3 - Yes, this is a generic one, but for god's sakes, **try to focus on your hobbies or whatever makes you happy**. I know everyone says this, but it's true. I get that a lot of you might be so down nothing brings you joy, I've been through that too. In the beginning of 2018 I got medical anxiety so horrible I couldn't but sit by the TV with my parents, looking at reddit, fearing for my life. It's hard to overcome but I sought the help of a psychiatrist and got antidepressants that helped me get back on my feet. It should work the same for disassociation when you're depressed. You need to do something that starts your engine, so you can start doing something you like and get better eventually. I know it's hard, but such are our lives. And if you don't have hobbies, you can try doing something basic that makes people happy, like watching shows.\n\nI hope these three steps help you like they did me, I hope you find that cute girl who likes you someday, I hope you achieve greatness, hang in there, life is war.\n\nEdit: wouldn't have expected I'd get silvered, thanks.", "subreddit": "ForeverAlone"}

Finish it. That degree left hanging. Finish it. Wanted to learn Spanish? Terminarlo.\n\nPillar #3: Passion. Dive into a hobby with complete gusto. Dress like the person you always wanted to be. Ask out that achingly hot woman/man next to you at the store (it doesn\u2019t matter if they turn you down, you\u2019re now officially \u201cone of those people\u201d who can do that.\n\nThen, when all your pillars are complete.

Theres nothing to look forward to. Sure, college is nice, but the process is freaking me out and there doesnt seem like a way out. I can't even focus on my homework anymore, I just sit and stare out into space daydreaming, otherwise I get so sad I just lie down. I haven't been eating well, and as a result I've lost 20 pounds (although tbh it has been good for my health as I dropped from being obese to being borderline overweight/okay weight).

Why should I carry on?

At one point, they were talking about when they first started drinking and most of them said they were 12 or 13. They started drinking and partying that young. They also go to parties like every week or two and have more than one friendship group. Obviously I'm not invited to the parties since I've only been hanging around them for like 2 weeks but it really is eye opening. Normal people just exist on such a vastly different level than I do. Their life experiences are completely different to mine. The people I hang around with aren't really the highest tier normies (and it feels weird to even classify people like that when you actually talk to them) but they still have so much more experience than I do. When a normie from this group claims they are lonely, it doesn't make a difference because they still have like 2 other friendship groups and many other close friends to turn to. When they fall out with someone from the group, the people within the group end up getting along with them again in the end anyway because they're such an important part of the group, they're not able to just drop that person so easily. It's weird because people on reddit love to question me and say that I'm being delusional when I say that normies have had their first kiss before 16/17 and when I say that normies start partying at 12/13 but what I say is true. I've witnessed it. I knew people were doing that when I was 12/13 and now that I'm 18, literal 17 year olds have confirmed to me that they were partying at age 13 and they had their first kiss at like 14.", "subreddit": "ForeverAlone"}

(22m)", "author": "Testingbugs", "self_text": "Sorry but this is going to long post, I just want to get it out of my system. (and maybe get some advice.)\n\nThe feeling never hit me this hard until today, and I can't stop thinking about it. I don't think I'm depressed or suicidal, just have something on my chest and I just can't shake the feeling off.\n\nIt all started when I decide to get into reading, I was looking for a book and decided to read It by Stephen King. It's a amazing book and got great character building, sometimes I think it's too good. The book is about 7 kids forming a bond together and try to fight off against evil. While I was reading through the book, the feel envy starts to build up inside me. I don't know why, but sometimes it's so strong that I just can't focus on the words anymore and have to stop reading. I was envying their childhood. They grew up in a typical school where they were picked on by bullies, and slowly, they meet and start their story. I WANT to be them, want to be picked on by bullies, beat up, jealous of their friendship and their bond. I know this point I might sound like I have some weird fetish where I want to be hurt, but I don't think that's it, I want to have a exciting childhood, where things happen, we fight, and maybe have friends that we can share our feeling with. \n\nMy life has been simple, I'm grateful for that. I went to elementary school, middle school and high school without any trouble. There was never fights, arguments, probably because I don't talk to anybody. My normal day would just be consist of going to school, go home and do homework, work and play games. This same pattern just repeats itself through out all the schools, and now the same pattern is stuck with me now in college. \n\nI guess the reason I was envy of them is because I have NEVER got into a fight, and I have NEVER got into a real arguement with anybody. Everyone who I talk to has been nice to me, and I probably avoided all the bad ones. This results in me not knowing how to deal with anger. Everytime I feel anger or unfairness, the only way I can express those feeling is by crying. This happened in middle school, and then once again two years ago, when my supervisor yelled at me, I just broke down crying. I am ashamed of myself for not being able to toughen up and cry in front of my coworkers. \n\nThis still doesn't explain all the envy I feel, there's still something Im feeling that I can't explain until today. In the book, King wrote in the book \"Ben has no sense of lonely because he had never been anything but\" I think that's when it hit me, I was feeling lonely. I do have three close friends, but they live far away in another place and the only way of communication if by text, we talk everyday, but it just doesn't feel the same. There's no one I can open up my real feelings. Even this post, I'm posting this on an new alt account and probably will never mention to anyone about my issues. I try to look around reddit and found not many people have \"true\u201c friends, I am willing to accept the fact that I might never find anyone I can call true friends, but the feeling of loneliness and envy just haunt me. I'm want to accept this feeling because its how life works, how being adult works, fiction is fiction, but I just can't help but feel down.\n\nI feel a bit better writing this post and sharing my feelings, maybe receive a little feedback.

I like to think I have a good idea of what I do and don't like about myself and work everyday to better my mood and outlook on life. With that being said, being alone and being lonely are two thing I still work on separating from time to time. Not sure why I said that but Im typing as things are coming so I apologize for the delay of the topic. But to get back to the title; When I'm out in public, I tend to take notice of everything around me. I genuinely enjoy seeing people engage with each other. I love watching peoples faces light up, families interacting, and just seeing things happen in general. It's when it comes to couples that the loneliness I can't seem to overcome really takes a hold of me. When I see couples together in public, young or old, I can't help but smile and truly wish the best for them. I feel so much of something and yet I still have never been able to put a word to it. I just know to see two people together, and to watch them simply enjoy each other's presence fills me with happiness, but also a sort of loneliness. That sense of sadness makes me feel as though, if I could give them my life, my future years and my capacity of love, I would. I would trade my life so that they would have \"extra love\" for each other, to be able to overcome anything. It's a hard thing to explain but I figured I'd give it a shot. As a guy who only just began learning how to express his feelings due to years of suppressed child abuse, this isn't an easy thing to explain.", "subreddit": "lonely"}

I'm not really expecting any replies or anything I just need to get all this off my chest. \n\nMy now ex girlfriend and I meet in Middle School started dating our freshman year of high school and by our senior year we had moved in together (I never got along with my parents are her parents didn't really care). After we graduated we lived together for 3 years before her ex boyfriend decide to show up at our house (to this day I'm still not sure how he found out where we lived) he was mentally and physically abusive to her when they were dating and for about a year after we started dating he tried to get her back and start fights and get into arguments with me. Then one day he just stopped at first we were concerned but then eventually we forgot about him until he showed up one day 3 years later. He tried to convince her that he had changed and to give him another chance. When she said no he became angry and threatened us before he left. That night my girlfriend and I talked about what we were going to do and we eventually decided to move states. We planned on moving anyways this just gave us a reason. We spent the next few months saving as much as we could. We both had low paying jobs so we wound up only having enough money to send one of us. So we sent her ahead to settle in find a job up there etc.  I stayed behind and kept working we made the long distance work every weekend I'd either drive (if I had 3 or more days together off) or fly up there I never made her come down to where I lived because she had enough to worry about she had college and a job she was taking care of our dog. So I figured she had enough to deal with. I did that for about a year saving whatever I could wherever I could working multiple jobs. Until a few months ago I finally had saved enough. I put in my two weeks at both my jobs and started packing up what little things we had left at our old apartment. The day finally came I packed everything into the car packed up the cat and drove. We wound up moving 4 states away so it was a long drive. I wound up finding a decent paying job but it required long hours and left me tired most days. That combined with the fact that I was never great with people and didn't like crowds. I didn't really make any friends. She had been there for a little over a year and was going to school so she made quite a few friends. Whenever we went out it would always be with one of her friends from work or school and it was fun I enjoyed it and would make small talk with them but none of them really ever became my friend. Fast forward a couple of months and we started arguing she didn't like that I worked so much and that I was \"emotionally draining\" I believe is how she put it (I'm bipolar and I admit I can be hard to deal with sometimes). A couple of weeks later we wound up breaking up. She's currently living with a friend and I'm living in our ( well I guess it's technically my) apartment. She stopped by the beginning of the week and collected the rest of her things while I was at work. Things didn't end well and I don't see us talking again anytime soon. So now I'm 4 states away from what few friends I have and I don't know a single person here. It's just me my job and my cat. And I just feel so alone. \n\nIf you read all of this thank you and I'm sorry if it was to long but like I said I just needed to get all this off my chest.", "subreddit": "lonely"}

It is not something I'm proud of, and I'm ashamed of it and I'm trying to work on it but it is really really hard to push yourself to the limit without anyone. Motivating myself is the hardest thing to do. Sometimes you realize that you ran out of energy and have no motivation.\n\nI did realize this just after I broke up with my ex girlfriend. I finally dared myself to do it after for a long time trying to save the relationship even though I saw many red flags from her but when the red flag come from her parents and she supported her parents more than me, then I realize that it is time to go. We broke up in a friendly way, we wanted to stay as friends but we did not handle the aftermath well. I talked with her a week, a month, after we broke up but it just make things much much worse every time we talked so she cut off me and it was really sad. I blamed myself for not being able to save the relationship, I blamed myself for not handling the post breakup well. There are times I wish I was still with her but I constantly have to remind myself that she is not meant for me. Then I realized myself I go through cycles of chasing other girls, but I realized that I don't know what I'm looking for. I found many girls waving much red flags than my ex has. I made good connection with a few girls but they eventually distanced away from me. Or there are some whom I saw interested in me but I saw red flags so I have to move on. When there are periods I realized that I am alone I was scared like, I am in the darkness. I tried to mingle with my friends more but I feel I don't actually fit in the circles. I always try myself to fit in the circles but now I'm just pretty tired. I don't have any circle, I don't have a potential crush, and every potential crushes that I found are always not looking something serious. I realized that this is not good, I am looking for a rebound. This is bad, I wish I can stop myself but the world is too scary for being alone... I want to do more of fun things like gym, playing guitar, or maybe online games but I am too busy with my PhD works and I don't have enough time for that.\n\nSo I am looking fro any advice on how to be able to motivate myself, be able to stand on my own? I realized that I am up and down, there are periods I am enthusiastic but there are other periods that I have anxiety, depressive attack that led me one time almost willing to jump from the 3rd floor but fortunately suicide hotline helped me a lot and I don't have such thinking since then.", "subreddit": "ForeverAlone"}

Initially, I had only positive thoughts about moving, it was what I wanted for a year. I knew I was leaving everything behind, friends and family but I thought it would be so easy getting started here.\n\nFor context, I am usually the center of attention back home and am super extroverted and loud. I assumed it would be the same here. I ended up booking a flight to Sweden that would arrive one week before I started my classes. As soon as I arrived, I booted up Tinder to try and meet other guys (I'm gay) to get to know and maybe make some friends along the way. I ended up meeting a guy on there that I thought was so fun and great. We ended up having about a 14 hour date where he showed me around the city and his favorite spots, then we went out to a couple of bars and had a great time. I thought about how amazing my night was and how much of a great start this was to my next 2 years.\n\nHe ended up telling me he wanted to only be friends after a week of not texting me. During that week, school had started and we had orientation week. I had to miss the first 3 days I was accepted late and couldn't sign up for the Swedish classes offered the first 3 days. I walked into the 4th day of orientation and immediately had social anxiety. A group of 300 new students and everyone had a group of friends they bonded with, and I was alone and had no one to talk to. I stayed for one hour and left.\n\nThe next day it was the same thing, I couldn't bring myself to talk to anyone because it was too nerve wracking. I needed someone to vent to, but the time difference from back home meant everyone was sleeping and I had no one. I turned to the same guy I met on Tinder but he wouldn't reply to any of my texts. I realized I was clinging on to him because he was the one thing that made me feel at home in a country where I knew no one. The same day he friend zoned me and it all felt like too much. I was on the subway and was trying to hold back my tears until I could get off. I did, but I was in the middle of the city center and was hyperventilating and just trying to hide the fact that I was having a breakdown.\n\nSince then its been getting worse and worse, my depression. I met another guy, but he ended up friend zoning me as well. \n\nIt's been about 3 weeks in class and I find it extremely hard to try to talk to anybody in class first. People are all acquainted and talking and laughing but I feel like I can't join. It feels like when people talk to me they are looking at me but not at all listening, like they don't care. I want to be friends with people but I don't want them to see me as begging for a connection, even though I am. \n\nI just want a connection with someone, but the more you ask for that, the more you distance people from you. It's very hard. Classmates will tell me about how they went out with others from the class and it hurts my feelings because why couldn't I be invited? I wish it was easy to stay positive but it's hard. Feels like no one really wants to be associated with me.\n\nWe have a groupchat for the class and I really want to ask if anyone wants to hang out with me but I have a feeling no one would reply or just say they are busy or maybe talk about me behind my back and say how I'm desperate for friends.\n\nSorry if you read this and it's a lot of information, it just feels good to let it out to other people.", "subreddit": "lonely"}

Quite frankly I've never seen her as a romantic interest, despite her beauty.

Yes, I'm jealous). And I remember that, whenever there was nobody around, we:\n\n- talked about intimate stuff\n- held hands\n- kissed each other everytime we could, not just on lips but also forehead/cheek/arms/legs/etc. as a way of being intimate and playing around\n- she put her head on my lap and I did the same with her when we watched TV or something\n\nThe usual stuff normal couples do...\n\nWe didn't even had sex in the dream and yet, as simple and trivial as it might seem, I felt like I wanted to stay there forever. It was literal heaven. I felt happy, for once in a long time I felt happy and knew how it feels to connect with somebody on a deeper level and be intimate with them, both physically and emotionally.\n\nUntil I woke up to reality... and fell again into the loneliness depression hole with the usual self-hatred and will to die. \n\nI fucking hate my life.\n\n/end rant", "subreddit": "ForeverAlone"}

My future appears dim and it doesn\u2019t look like it will change. I am in the closet and hating every moment of it. I am waiting to break free but I fear my life will only get worse once I come out.

I don\u2019t like looking at children or parents because they remind me I am abnormal due to my attractions and isolation. Lately, seeing straight couples is an annoyance due to the fact that I will never have that natural relationship with the opposite sex and I don\u2019t desire having children in any fashion. Seeing gay couples is sad but only because of my envy of their pride. I\u2019ve never seen myself being with anybody growing due to my hatred of my sexuality. I didn\u2019t even think I would even live this long. I wish I was born normal and that I had a great upbringing. But, due to my physical disability as a child &amp; home life, my memories became foggy by choice. I don\u2019t like to think about it. I\u2019m just here to say I am a very lonely man.

We kinda tell each other everything and he knows that I have never had a girlfriend and my struggle with that. However, my friend is like the exact opposite. He's attractive and tall and has no problem getting girlfriends.\n\nHe usually hangs out with me on the weekends at least either on friday or Saturday. On the day he doesnt hang out with me, he parties with his other friends, gets girls, etc. And he seems to have a lot of fun and stuff and tells me all about it. And I feel bad that I'm holding him back. He's a really good guy and I dont want him to ruin his life by spending at least one of his weekend days with me. He should spend his whole weekend having fun and not having to listen to my misery lol. I was thinking of just hanging out with him after work on weekdays instead. This way he gets his weekend freedom and I can still have a good friend. What do you guys think?\n\nAlso before you ask, he invites me to his stuff sometimes but I don't fit in with his crew. They're very extroverted and dont seem to like me anyways. So I usually pass.\n\nOn the flip side he never seemed angry or sad or anything when hanging out with me. He seems happy, but idk.\n\nIf he asks why I can't hang out, I'll just say I have family events that I need to go to every weekend or w/e.

I also do this thing where I\u2019ll think of the nearby trains, there is one not far from my house. The one by my house is under a bridge. I think of the probability of being on the train, while a person who would be either one of the best friendships I could ever have, or one of the best lovers I could ever have, being on the top of the bridge, or vice versa with me being on the bridge, while simultaneously a person who would be one of the most amazing friends or romantic partners would be directly under my literal exact feet, unbeknownst to me. I think about the people on the highways, in the cars, and in their own houses on a typical day. Oh, how I wish I was omnipresent. I feel I am missing out on so much in life, being sheltered all the way and then isolating on top of it. I think about the ways I could fit into these peoples lives. I wonder where I was meant to be right now, because I\u2019m so obviously out of alignment. When I watch videos online, I tend to notice the background more than the focal point of the subject they are talking about; this includes, yes, porn. I look at the rooms, the houses, I look at the outside. I cherish all that exists on this earth. It\u2019s such a large world, despite what anybody says. I wonder if these places are now abandoned, or if a patch of grass or cement has been neglected. I think of how many times a particular spot was stepped in, I think of the things that were touched, how long ago, and the things that were not. It\u2019s superb to me how magnificently vast this world is, and that I could never ever touch every spot of the earth, and meet all of the people, in my human lifetime. It makes me so depressed thinking about that. I have the greatest affinity for all that there is, and I want to give all that there is, the time of day.

{"post_id": "d711rn", "created_utc": 1569013115, "title": "I feel like i have no one by my side anymore", "author": "Moozeyy", "self_text": "I met this girl on tinder around late March - got to know her a bit we messed around and hooked up quite often for about 6 weeks and she was pushing for a relationship. I on the other hand was not completely sure how i felt about her but the idea of her moving on really hurt me so I committed with the mindset of \"Eh, why not?\". I feel like this was a mistake - i shouldn't have committed when i wasn't ready but the month that followed she made be extremely happy. I was always talking to her whether that be in person or on Snapchat. We're both in college so she slept over at my dorm literally every day. I didn't know relationship burnout was a very real thing and eventually it came to a point where we would have the same conversations every day - it would still be fun and playful but there would be moments where I would just feel really bad, borderline disgusted from talking to her even though nothing in the conversation has triggered it ever. We've never gotten into an argument and on paper this girl felt perfect for me. I went on a date with her to the park and I remember not wanting to let her out of my sight. I truly felt in love with this girl. \n\nOn our one month anniversary as I was taking the train to her house to celebrate I remember getting this really awful feeling - wondering whether i actually liked this girl or not. But the thing is i cared about her a LOT, i cared about her so much she was my best friend that i could get intimate with. So i brushed these feelings away and i generally had a good time that day with her. The feelings would periodically come back and I would continue to brush them away because getting notifications from her really lit my day up and it just made me happy even though i didnt feel much infatuation. When I first met her in person I wasn't super infatuated with her and thus i was a bit hesitant to fully get involved. But we kept pushing the boundary and it eventually turned into a relationship. I fell in love with her personality and thats what kept me going. This feeling persisted for about 2 weeks until I actually couldn't take it anymore - I woke up super early to go see a therapist at my school (which was 2 hours away, I made the commute because it really messed with me so much and I felt really hurt by it). It was really driving me insane so I had o call her up and break up with her. I really did not want this to happen - my mind screamed to be with her but my heart didnt. I cared about her a lot more than I did love her and losing her really messed with me. This girl has literally been the perfect girlfriend and I can't help but feel disappointed in myself because I feel like this was an amazing opportunity lost because of something so close yet so far to me (my feelings). I desperately did not want to feel this way and did everything I could to try to change said feelings. I started going to therapy, I started seeing a psychiatrist I tried logically working things out I tried venting to my friends I tried taking time off away from her to get away from this codependency I developed. It felt like something within my control because its ultimately something that internal - and i really really wanted to cultivate my feelings leaning towards falling in love with her but I had anxiety built underneath with us actually getting together. All i wanted was to get rid of this anxiety.\n\nMy theory is that I've subconscious developed a standard for how I feel around her when she slept over all the time and 95% of my day involved her. It was just a constant good, harmonious feeling and I really enjoyed having that feeling. I really missed what we had and by the time she moved back home, it became super inconvenient for me to even visit her. She had work and it around 4pm on weekdays and was never available on weekends and she also wasn't allowed to leave the house on her own and it was an hour commute going to her house from mine. We still talked every second of every day and I figured that the solution to my feeling this way was not enough quality time spent so I tried making an effort to have daily date nights where I would watch shows with her online until I felt sleepy.\n\nWe've gone back and forth with \"I can't handle talking to you anymore it hurts too much we need to cut contact\" to \"More than anything I respect and value you as a person above all so not having you in my life really hurts me\". We've supposedly cut contact indefinitely about 5 or 6 times in total only for either me or her to reach out the day after feeling terrible about everything. \n\nWe kept talking to each other but with tension in the air for about 2 months after we broke up - I really wanted to give myself space and try to get back what we originally had because I missed that so much. We had a similar sex drive and strong dynamic in all departments except for romantic, she was open minded and took interest in all my hobbies, she's been so selfless and has always been there for me when I felt down and I also served as a shoulder for her to lean on. She was fun to talk to we played similar video games... she just felt perfect but this anxiety really held me back from truly being with her. I'm still tearing up about all of this even now - 3 months post breakup. \n\nFast forward to today - shes told me that shes fully moved on or is very close to it and she believes that I was more in love with our dynamic but not necessarily her. She still respects me but shes blocked me on all social media because she figured that that was best. I could reach out to her through her number but the way we talk to each other hasn't been the same. She said she hates being cold towards me but she can't bring herself to be that warm again from all the stress that shes felt during the summer and I fully understand. On top of all of that I keep venting to my friends and they keep telling me the same answers - its gotten to the point where a lot of them are just really annoyed at me now because they keep having to repeat themselves and I don't listen. The reason why I don't listen when they say to just move on and cut her off completely is Ive never met anyone who has gone through a similar situation to mine and I feel like they can only sympathize with me so much. They're treating this as just some other relationship breakup and would always give me that generic \"Move on you can to better\" type of advice. But no, I have yet to see a true conflict in values and morals and like, why would I want to get rid of this connection is talking to her makes me happy? It also really hurts losing her on top of all the stuff that I've said. I really feel like no one just understands me. So not only do I have to deal with losing her - my friends are legitimately getting really angry and annoyed at me now so I'm even hesitant to vent to them anymore. I've been relying on my therapist and a therapy hotline and now I've resorted to posting on this subreddit. Yeah, I go in circles about this whole situation but the circles have progressively been getting smaller and it's been a process but Im progressively feeling better and better about the whole situation I just relied on my friends to talk me out of it when Im feeling down for quick relief.\n\nLast night I got really drunk and played pictionary and blurted out words that were offensive to people in the room but i was too drunk to realize the damage that I've been doing. What started off as a fun friendly game ended in people feeling uncomfortable and upset at me, and I still thought about my ex even afterwards. I've apologized as much as I could and one guy is just tired of hearing me apologize without taking action, but the other 2 seemed to be a bit more forgiving. I legitimately did not realize that I was hurting people... I just wanted everyone to have a good time. There's no one I can really vent to because the people I would normally go to to vent about issues I have are the ones who are upset at me.\n\nI also tried going on tinder to cope with this emptiness but none of the girls I messaged were really responsive to me so that's also a big bummer lol. I don't have family to rely on because I'm not really that close with them and my mom is a bit old so her values are a lot more different from mine so venting to her doesn't really help me feel any better. Earlier today I felt like I didn't want to be alive anymore - but the thoughts stopped there. I'm just tired of feeling lonely and horrible all the time from all these things that have built up and I really dont know who to go to anymore to talk about my feelings. No family, I'm graduating late so a lot of my friends at my school have graduated and I only really have select few people to really hang out with. My workload is relatively light so I have a lot of free time on my hands but no one to really spend it with. I just feel... so alone. and I feel like a bad person and just overall awful.\n\nIf youve read this far thank you so much for listening to my problems from the bottom of my heart.

It was like even if I was surrounded by everyone, I would still feel alone. I let those feelings inside for a long while, started my fourth year in college (finished the relationship, though, since I didn't want to hurt someone for just not being able to feel anything) and during the first 4 months I felt alone. Like I wasn't the \"main character\" or a \"support character\" in anyone's life. I distracted myself with other things, tried to not think of why everyone got so close with each other and left me behind. Eventually these creepling feelings went away and I simply started to like having alone times (even went alone to an international internship, traveling alone, feeling good). \n\nHowever, for no reason, this last week, after 2 years, it all came back, with a lot strenght. It was in a happy week, even. I just finished submiting my thesis (yay), was hanging with my friends almost everyday, laughing, etc, and suddenly, this feeling of loneliness strikes back.

They didn't know what to do, I kept saying sorry because no one is at fault. I just don't know what to do and I hate to bother people with this, since my humor changes a lot (or I simply don't react like I would) and I feel nauseous. I even feel empty and that I'm no good (since I'm finishing college, not having a job already like others around me doesn't help either). \nJust wanted to share, thought it might help somehow.", "subreddit": "lonely"}

Recently just got out of a 4.5 year relationship, we lived together 3 years and engaged for 1, ended 4 months before the wedding. She ended things for a multitude of reason, a lot of it on me. My mind was and still is so set on marrying her and starting my life and family with her. Knowing that that\u2019s not possible... It\u2019s hard. I don\u2019t know how to be happy by myself. I haven\u2019t had to do it for so long. Honestly, I probably wasn\u2019t even happy by myself back then either. But how can I possible be alone? Yeah I have great, wonderful friends and family. But I still feel alone romantically. I love her so goddamn much. I don\u2019t think I\u2019ll ever stop. I\u2019ve always believed that yes, you can love multiple people. But there\u2019s always one who stands out. And I feel like she\u2019s always going to be that one. Who I look back at with so much regret and disdain for myself for being the reason I can\u2019t be with her anymore. But I was also so hurt and betrayed by her ending things... yes I know I\u2019m to blame and that she was justified. But since nothing was going on on the surface leading up to the breakup, I guess I felt like I was caught by surprise. So I guess I\u2019m honestly very hurt by it and I guess my defense mechanism is leading me to be angry about it. Fuck I don\u2019t even know anymore. I\u2019m obviously massively depressed and taking a lot of it out on myself. But still. I just needed to vent. I probably could go on for much longer but I\u2019ll leave it at this for now.

And i noticed one thing. \"i'm only looking to meet interesting people\". At first i thought that it's just a nice way to reject people. It propably is. But at the same time, after talking to a few people i think they really believe this. The whole \"don't look for a relationship\" and \"let it happen naturally\" advice. When they go on tinder, a dating app mind you they don't go on dates. They aren't looking for a relationship or hookups on a dating app, no sir. They are looking to meet new people for no reason. When they talk to a person on this dating they don't want to find out if he would be a good partner and be interested. No they are chatting with a stranger like if they just met him on the street. When they meet it's a friendly meeting for friends. Totally not a date. One person told me it's to not get atached and no not get false hope. I mean maybe but you are still looking for someone on a dating app. Yeah, they might not be interested but you still do it with the intention of getting in a relationship. What's the point of this charade? Why not just say \"looking for a relationship/hookup. Might work, might not. Let's see\" instead of the \"i'm doing everything but looking for the thing i'm looking\".

Again. You know, *the usual*.\n\n*Okay, maybe that's just me. Fine, whatever.* \n\nYou go back to the drawing board. *Maybe I should join a club?*\n\nAnd to make sure it wouldn't be a problem if you *didn't* 'find your people' right away, it has to be something you'd enjoy doing *anyway,* right?\n\n**So I've been looking into this for a bit, and here's what I found.**  \nLet me know what you think! Maybe we can help each other find our sense of belonging again.\n\nBasic checklist: regardless of what it is, It seems that in every case, you'd have to be \n\nA: mobile enough to get there in the first place(some places are hard to get to if you depend on public transport/bicycle),   \nB: It has to fit your budget  \nC: Be really good at/into it due to required commitment  \nD: Be rather social in the first place because there's either an existing (in-)group already(clubs) to fit into, or everyone is new but the activity might not stretch long enough to really get to know another(courses) so first impression matter even more than usual. ^(I hope this doesn't turn you off as much as it did me already.)\n\nIf you think you can manage those - great! Let's find something to do!  \nHere, I've compiled a list, let me walk you through it giving you some examples:\n\n**College clubs**\n\nI used to be part of a study club(not a fraternity). It was okayish(?) despite most of it being an 'in'-group I wasn't part of.   \nStill, worth a shot if you are trying to make new friends while in college, sure.\n\nNow, for me, I'm 25 years old *-graduated and employed-* so college clubs are out of the question.  \nI can't really go drinking every other night ^(due to being fucking autistic and) having to be in an office at 9am anyway, but surely there's other stuff to do...*right*?\n\n**Meetups**  \nTaking [meetup.com](https://meetup.com) as an example.   \nWhere I live most meetups are either:\n\n* Work-related meetups - Cool, I'm attending! Often tricky due to location or time(e.g. 5pm, disregarding travel distance), but this is something I can work with.   \nMostly professional though, so not sure how to make anything past acquaintances there.\n* Expat meetups - To get to know this city. Specifically for expats - which i'm not.\n* Language/ethnic meetups - mostly by and *for* people of a specific ethnicity. Over here that's great if you're Indian or Chinese - which I'm not.\n* LGBT-oriented and/or women-only meetups - I came across these on [meetup.com](https://meetup.com) faster compared to other sites, so maybe that's useful for those of you interested. Again, this isn't for me, so I'll pass.\n\n**Clubs/hobby groups**  \nOkay, so meetups are kind of everywhere and in-between, what about actual clubs?\n\n* Sports clubs   \nUsed to be a part of a few over time. From what I've seen, after a certain age, sports clubs are more competitive(especially team sports) and split by gender. I'm not into sports or competition though. So...no thanks? \n* Hobby clubs  \nI know there are some online communities for specific hobbies/interests, but most stick to Discord/facebook groups from what I've seen. Some groups seem fun, although you'd have to wonder if the shitposting potential of a hentai appreciation club is really worth the social stigma :')\n\n**Volunteering**  \nI only know of these two. Not sure about any others?\n\n* Animal shelters  \nI looked into this but couldn't really find anything. I'm horribly allergic to animals, otherwise i'd work at the shelter if I could though. I'd love to help care for the animals there.\n* Homeless shelters  \nWhich really requires a specific type of person to be able to handle the different walks of life you will meet there. Personally, I'm just not cut out for this. \n\n**Courses**  \nTypically more expensive, but generally within travel range and more interest-based than the others.   \nNot sure about average age of the people joining. On the plus side, everyone will be new, so you won't have to fit yourself into an existing group, but that also means you need to be social enough to connect with people from the get-go?\n\n* Skill-based courses  \ne.g. cooking! I'd be interested, it's in-range, but it's expensive as hell and i'm worried about how competitive these are. What if I suck at these? I'm slow at picking up new things, not sure if this is something recommendable?\n* Interest-based  \nLike drawing or music!  \nI'd join a photography group, but from what I've seen most split up to make their own pictures so there's not much socializing going on there it would seem.\n\nSo in the end, I can only think of signing up for a few courses and work-related meetups, and even then it seems you'd have to be a social butterfly in the first place or you'll end up 'just be attending'.   \nI'm guessing the best way to go about it is to use meetups as incidental practice, then move on to more regular stuff once meeting strangers becomes slightly more comfortable? Let me know what you think! \n\nAnyway, thank you for coming to my ted talk(again). Sorry if my writing is all over the place.   \nI hope it's of some use, because I sure as hell am lost on where to go from here.", "subreddit": "ForeverAlone"}

So that night \\*in my dream\\*  I decided to bike to a convenience store to buy things to make me happy, once arrived there was a group of people looking up to no good, they stared at me as I was locking my bike, after finishing locking my bike I head inside the convenience store to look for things, the store was empty because it was late at night and most people were sleeping, and stands there the convenience store cashier doing his night shift. As looking around the store and I suddenly hear some loud noises outside and ran outside to see what's going on, then I saw my bike, destroyed, pieces everywhere, and both wheels gone. I quickly looked around and saw the group of people riding motorcycles and two of them holding my bike wheels and everyone in the group laughing at me. I quickly ran back inside and told the cashier what happens, the cashier told me he couldn't anything and gave me a  cigarette to calm down, but I said no to the cigarette because I don't smoke so he ended up giving me coffee instead, seconds later I wake to my alarm, when I woke up I started to cry. Looking back at the dream makes me emotional because the dream reminds me of loneliness and how much people hate me. I'm sorry if my dream story doesn't interest you, I just wanted to share this somewhere, Thanks for listening.", "subreddit": "lonely"}

After a 14-year addiction to social media, web forums, chat rooms, etc. \n\nLike, really bad addiction. \n\nBut of course, society only cares about substance addictions, so those of us with non-substance addictions get either shoved to the wayside, or one in every million gets a lucky chance to appear on a trashy reality show for 5 minutes. (upside-down smiley face emoji)\n\nAnyways, yeah, been addicted since age 12. That's when my family broke down and got us internet, after years of me and my brother begging (my parents were, and still are, stuck in the stone age). This was 2005 and my friends from school had already been online for years. So I had a lot of catching up to do. Too much, in fact. \n\nI overdid it. No more hanging out with people IRL (never had many friends to begin with anyway), no more video games, or artwork. It was all internet forums, all the time. \n\nIt's not like my life was much better before it, anyway. I was a socially inept autistic loser. A guy like me would never end up successful or with a good life. I guess I didn't really lose much. \n\nSo I tried to make up for my lack of good IRL relations, with having some online. \n\nIt usually failed. Way too much bullying, and an overly sensitive person like me couldn't handle it. \n\nI cried. Self harmed. A lot. No medications or therapy ever helped. Been arrested for making threats after being bullied. Been in psych wards for constant suicide threats. You name it. \n\nOn the rare times someone did offer to hang out IRL, I'd politely decline so I could spend time online instead. Yeah, I was pretty bad. \n\nBut, why would I hang out with this IRL person, who, even though was nice to me, I didn't have everything in common with?? When I could find people online who are more similar?? That was my faulty logic, at the time. \n\nCame back to bite me now, I guess. Hindsight is 20/20. \n\nMore and more each year, the internet becomes a hostile place. Especially in a post-2016 world. Rampant politics and bullying and drama. More self-harm, more crying myself to sleep. \n\nMore seeing other people with decent lives that I'll never have. \n\nI learned that the internet doesn't want me. I have zero to offer anybody, except the few desperate horny old gay men asking for nudes. But as for people I actually desire to talk to, nobody wants me. \n\nAnd nobody ever will. \n\nI ruined my chances of both real life and online friendships. I ruined my chances of having dates I actually would enjoy going on. Completely ruined. \n\nAnd I wish I wasn't such a wuss so I could just kill myself already. \n\nBut nobody online will want me. I have no talents, no skills, don't look good, autistic awful personality, of a demographic and country that lots of people automatically hate, I mean... just too much. \n\nAnd it is partially my fault. I get too clingy too fast. I can't help it. I find something I like, I know I need to hold on as much as I can. Because I won't have it for long. \n\nMaybe I'll just go sit in a corner somewhere and cry the rest of my life.

But i still managed to make small groups of friends who didn't mind my weirdness,usually with others who didn't totally fit in as well.After realising how weird i was after thinking about these.I developed severe social anxiety.this made it even more difficult to talk to people,the constant fear of others making fun of me behind my back or thinking im weird and wanting to stay away.my entire primary school life i was lonely. i was the weird kid in class,i was made fun of alot.My appearance didn't help either,i the tallest in class yet i'm very thin,weighing as much as an average girl (i'm a guy).i basically looked like a stickman.These happened in primary school.\n\nNow onto secondary school.I wanted to start fresh,start a new,my secondary school was one that was located very far away from my primary school,no one knew me,it was the perfect chance to start anew! Or so i thought.Everyone already had friends they made during primary school.again i started off alone.During the school orientation activities and games,i tried my best to speak up and participate,but i was ignored.On the second day of orientation,just as things got a little better,i manage to screw it up terribly.on that day someone came to talk to me,introduced me to afew of his friends.on that day,the orientation had a fun game using rock paper scissors.STUPID me got overly aggressive as i was engrosses in the games and started shouting and laughing away as i won in streaks.and yelling terrible stuff to the players on the other side.I'm guessing because of this,people no longer tried to approach me.Of course i regretted and cringed when i thought about it,but i didnt want to stop trying,i didnt want a repeat of my life in primary school,being shunned and lonely.\n\nI tried to join into groups,tried to approach others,turns out.In my class,no one played video game but me.everyone's interest lied elsewhere.mainly in sports like basketball.As the skinny boy i was,i had no interest or experience in sports,i wasn't able to join or contribute in any conversation at all.i was lonely for the first 2 years.However.I manage to get through it as i had 3 friends from my primary school who would play video games with me.\n\nOm the 3rd year of secondary school.i manage to make a very small group of friends,there were 5 of us,the others didn't play games either,but they didn't mind my weirdness,instead they found it a little funny,hence i was able to be the funny person for once,i would try my best to make them laugh as much as possible.i was confident for once.they were people i could talk about anything to.\n\nThis point in time was probably the peak in my life so far,i was happy and not lonely.However,nothing last forever.everything slowly went downhill.2 of my primary school friend slowly stopped coming online as they spent more time with their new friends in secondary school,to the point where they would reply my messages after days or even weeks.the last primary school friend found a girl  friend whom he met online in a game,had a huge crush on,and \"ditched me\".he completely stopped playing with me for the girl.From this point on i looked forward to school everyday as thats when i had friends with me.i didn't like the school holidays as i was bored and lonely.\n\nThis didnt last either as my secondary school life came to an end.everyone went their separate ways and found new friends BUT me.in my new school,i wasn't the weird kid anymore,i learnt to restrain and control myself.i could hang with the others in class,join in for lunch,but i wasn't close enough to be invited to outings.same thing as secondary school,i could not join in the conversation,nobody played games,the only topic that rises is \"girlfriends,relationship,sex\". I never even had a female friend before,there was nothing i could say,i just listened in silence.\n\nEveryone i knew left.even my online friends got into a relationship and stopped playing with me.I've got no one left and i feel so terrible.I wish i could find friends that stayed or a girlfriend that i could play with.Looking at everyone else having a big clique of friends or a girlfriend.I feel lonely and depressed.honestly,i cant help but feel jealous of everyone else.\n\nAnd worse of all,i fear that this may last forever.", "subreddit": "lonely"}

I just need to get my thoughts out.\n\nI've always been an introvert. And I've always been \"closed\", so to speak. I've never understood how to just be completely open and inviting to strangers, which has obviously hindered making friends. I can, at a stretch, for a limited time force myself out of this, i.e. in the first weeks of University, but I can't keep this up for long and inevitably fall back into the comfort of my own company.\n\nI'm 32 now. I've never had a proper relationship (just short-term things that we both knew were short-term things, and the last of those was five years ago now.) I've never slept with a girl I truly cared for.\n\nI don't have a great circle of friends to make up for that void either. I have a few friends, but they're all unconnected to one other - there's no opportunity to go on group holidays or have game nights etc, cus at most there's only two of us. And they all have girlfriends or wives, so I'm understandably not a key part of their lives. This can be summed up by the fact that if we meet up, it'll be the major event of my week but a tiny footnote in theirs.\n\nI haven't had a holiday in eight years, because I have no-one to go with. I take my annual leave from work but have nothing to do with it. I'd love to go somewhere, but alone? I can't do it. And I'm not outgoing or naturally welcoming (or good looking) enough to be one of those people who can travel the world and meet amazing people at every stop. I'd set off alone, see whereever alone, and come back alone. I've considered things like moving to a completely new town, but it would just change the scenery, not who I am.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAll this together makes me even more closed off from others. I am actually afraid(!) of the completely benign questions \"what are you doing this weekend?\", or \"have you got any holidays planned?\" from colleagues at work, because I'm terrified they'll see how boring my existence is. Everyone does something at the weekends, even if it's just family stuff. If I'm meeting a friend for a drink on Saturday evening (maybe once or twice a month) I'll try and say that, but what about the rest of Saturday and Sunday, weekend after weekend... \n\nI hate talking about myself, because there's so little to ever say. Even people I get on with at work, after a few months I've already told them about past holidays etc and I run out of things to say, because nothing new happens to me and I have no new experiences to tell. And this makes making new friends impossible - at an age where most people have settled down anyway, with families of their own.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nToday I've been trying to think of something to do or someplace to go, even just for a drive. But I realise I'll just get out of the car at wherever (let's say I drove to the countryside), and look around, then get back in my car and drive home...\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI don't really think I'm depressed about things anymore. I've been depressed before, and it was way more intense than this. This is just...... Numb. \n\nI'm slowly coming to terms with the fact that I'm unlikely to ever meet anyone, partly because I don't know how to, and partly because I've become completely entrenched in introversion to a level where even if I go to a friend's house by 10pm I'm craving solitude instead. I'm even becoming closed off from my parents, and barely tell them anything anymore.\n\nI'm bored of my life, and don't see how it can improve unless I completely change everything about myself, but even if I somehow manage to do that I still don't see how I can meet new friends, or a partner. Part of it is a catch-22 situation - I don't do anything because I don't have close enough friends/a partner, which makes my life boring, which gives me nothing to talk about, which means I'm less likely to make a good enough impression on anyone for them to become a friend or partner.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI do have a half-decent job, which eventually will lead to decent pay, and I've been going in early and leaving late because for the most part I actually enjoy it. But at the end of the day it's just a job. Someone in my company fell extremely ill a few months back, after dedicating a huge amount of their life to the job, and only one person went to see them in hospital. They'll probably never be able to work again. Was that job dedication worth it at the expense of what really matters? And what really matters is exactly what I don't have, nor do I ever see myself having.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIn terms of hobbies I've slowly dropped everything. Even video games, which I've always used as a distraction from these problems, have lost their appeal. I haven't turned on my games console in months. I've always been okay at most sports but never great at any of them, hence I never joined any clubs or met anyone that way. Apart from that? Nothing really.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWill I continue like this? For a while at least. But weekends are long, and the future looks so bleak, that I genuinely don't know. When I was majorly depressed I'd think about suicide but it was never more than that, but that was at University and I knew the future could change. But I'm now past that, and things are actually worse since everyone around me has adapted to adulthood whilst I've been left behind, living in an empty flat by myself. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nPeace.", "subreddit": "lonely"}

The date happened ... and I don't feel horrible about it (aside from one *small* little detail).  This was overall a good experience and regardless of what happens moving forward, I am glad that I did this.  \n\nAt the start of the day, I had to scramble to the store to grab a few things.  One of the topics of conversation we had via the dating app was about baking and a recipe for cookies that I wanted to bring to work.  I mentioned wanting to do a \"test batch\" before taking it in and I decided to make them before the date so she could try them.  It was quite a hectic morning and took a lot longer than I expected (the dough was not cooperating with me).  \n\nOnce that was done, I spent some time going over the spreadsheet I made as well as coming up with a strategy for how I was going to break ice and bring up my planned conversation topics.  The main things that worried me were the initial greeting (Hug or Wave), awkward silences, and the date's conclusion.  I have to say.  All of the preparation I did... was COMPLETELY USELESS.  I forgot about everything the MINUTE I stepped into the venue.  I was simply too nervous.   I got there about 30 minutes early because I was worried about parking. I found a spot and just decided to sit and wait.  I got increasingly nervous as more and more time passed and I'm almost certain I came across as unstable and terrified the people in the shop.\n\nAnyway, I saw her pull in.  She 100% saw me but I pretended not to see her.  I didn't want the point at which we saw each other to be so far from the point at which we actually greeted each other.  I also wasn't sure if I should wait for her to come to me or meet her halfway.  So i forced pretended not to see her to force the second option and avoid any possibly awkwardness.  \n\nSo she comes in and we immediately make eye contact.  At that point, I decided to stand up and meet her halfway as she approached.  I decided to go with the \"side hug\" option, as it seemed like a good balance between the wave and the full hug.  She reciprocated, so I think it was a good call.  She was late and apologized for it and we had a brief chat about our commute.  Then we went to get the ice cream.\n\nI went in expecting to either pay for us both or respect her agency if she wanted to split.  I was caught off guard when she asked if she could please treat me to make up for being late.  I wasn't prepared for this scenario and kind of reflexively agreed because I didn't want to come across as rude by saying no her request.  Not sure if that was the right call or not, but it happened.  If there ever is a second date, I'm thinking I will pay for both of us to \"even\" the score.  \n\nAfter that, we began the conversation stage of the date.  Over time, I became less and less nervous.  The conversation was flowing pretty nicely.  There was the occasional pause in conversation, but it never lasted more than a few seconds.  I think that's normal.  I couldn't remember all of the topics from the spreadsheet off the top of my head, but the right ones were popping up at the right times.  We ended up speaking for maybe 1.5 hours.  Then she had to leave to go to a meeting (she told me about this well in advance, so It's not like she made up an excuse to get away from me).\n\nSo yeah.  In a vacuum, this turned out to be a pretty good date.  Nothing particularly disastrous happened.  Conversations flowed. Laughs were had.  Interests were piqued.  I might have left this date feeling pretty damn good.  Unfortunately, this isn't a vacuum, this is Armon2010 town baby.  And in Armon2010 town, Armon2010 can't leave a situation without some sort of embarrassing thing happening.  So what did I do?  Literally as we were picking up our things to walk to her car, I spilled half a cup of water on her.  I was so dumbfounded at what I had done that I was halfway tempted to do the Woody Woodpecker laugh... because it is cartoonishly comical how creative I am at finding ways to screw things up. We both rushed to grab some napkins to clean up the mess, then left as that was done.  \n\nI was feeling pretty defeated after that, but when we got to the car, she said that she had a great time talking with me and that she would text me later.  I said something to the effect of \"I really enjoyed this.  I hope we can see each other again\" to which she replied \"Yeah, for sure\".  She initiated another hug and I reciprocated.  This was a full hug this time and lasted a bit longer than the greeting hug.  Then we both left.  \n\nSo yeah.  I have mixed feelings.  I SPILLED WATER ON HER.  But she says she had a good time.  Speaking objectively, it was a good conversation despite some awkward moments, so if she genuinely meant that, I can totally see why.  At the same time, I can totally see why she would want to simply be polite.  It's not like I acted rude or inappropriately during the date.  I'm sure she left with the impression that I was a good person... but I don't know if I projected myself as \"dateable\".  There is also the water issue.\n\nOnly time will tell I guess.  I'll update you guys on the next chapter as more details come in.", "subreddit": "ForeverAlone"}

Whether it was puberty, hormones, or just plain old growing up I really began to notice the lack of a deeper connection I had with people. I started noticing how I was never anybody's first choice, how everyday after school people never wanted anything to do with me, how I was always left behind by my 'friends' whenever it was time to form groups. From then on, my brain never really shut up. I would constantly be thinking of my current situation, of things that could be but never will, how I wanted to not feel alone but was too scared to drop what few social connections I had and start over.\n\nI'd spend summer vacations complete isolated, would distract my mind from the toxic thoughts of loneliness by delving deeper into escapism into videogames, movies and TV shows. I'd try to make connections that I yearned for in real life, I tried to substitute this lack of connection by investing myself into these fictional relationships and friendships. But it only really just helped me cope, and make me wish for these meaningful relationships I'd see in fiction to be a reality.\n\nHighschool passed, and college came. I knew while this would be the end of what little relationships I had, it'd maybe be the start of something new. I tried to make friends, join clubs, the usual. Nothing ever clicked or connected, I would be surrounded by people with friends, making memories and lifelong connections. I'd go into a lecture with hundreds of people and sit alone, day in, day out. I gave up and spiralled heavily into depression, and soon thought of killing myself nigh constantly but never took the plunge to do self harm. At one point, I began re-evaluating my life and identified what was really worth living for. And I came to the conclusion that I'd continue living for my family, and try to better myself and reverse my situation.\n\nFreshman year went by, and I became a sophomore. I specialized in an engineering stream, the class sizes got smaller and dropped to 100, and I began seeing the same people everyday. I wanted a fresh start, and knew it would be hard. I couldn't work up the nerve to talk to anyone or make friends, but one day, a girl asked me to be my lab partner. As the socially incompetent person I am, I immediately leapt at this new opportunity to finally make a friend. I had no real idea how, so after noticing she often sat alone in class, I just constantly tried to sit next to her in class and make it a routine. In hindsight, this was probably incredibly creepy, but somehow, it worked out. She became my first real friend, we worked well together in lab and began working on most assignments together. Whenever a group assignment came up I'd ask her to be my partner, and she'd say yes. It might seem hilariously petty and it is, but it was just something I never really experienced. In highschool I was never wanted in groups and was often that kid the teacher had to shove into a random group and feel unwanted. It was honestly the first time I felt this way, the lonely thoughts still persisted when I got home, but I could always remind myself I would have a friend to talk to the next day.\n\nOf course, as my brain is my own worst enemy, I did catch feelings and develop a crush on my friend. She's a wonderful person, but I knew her well enough to know this would never work out. While first impressions might make it seem like she's introverted, she actually knows most of our class as acquaintances from the freshman year but just never really clicked with any of them which is why she sat alone. Outside of our major, she actually has a very active social life with many friends and I know while I consider her my best friend, the feeling is not mutual.\n\nHonestly for awhile, and even up to very recently currently with the beginning of junior year at university, I struggled with these feelings. Hell, I still do. I've finally reasoned with myself that I know my gut instinct that a confession would never lead anywhere, and it's not worth jeopardizing the friendship we have. Some may call it the \"friendzone\", but honestly I've spent this many years alone with nothing but my negative thoughts to know it's not worth it.\n\nSo that brings me here today. My friend has massively improved my social life and introduced me to many other new people to be acquaintances with. I still sit next to her everyday in class, joke with each other, talk about school and life, and just have a great time in general. While my crush will probably never go away, I genuinely just want to advance our friendship and be a closer friend. Those chronic lonely thoughts and bouts of anxiety never really go away, I still sometimes have moments where I hyper analyze my current situation and feel lonely. Hell, this is why I'm typing this out right now on a saturday night. But I just wanted to share this with you all, life can get better. While from time to time these thoughts will plague us, and always will, things can get better. It sounds cliche, but they really can. Cherish what you have, and no matter what your brain or anxiety tells you, take the plunge and make that new friend. They might be an asshole, or they might not, but it can really turn your life for the better.", "subreddit": "lonely"}

It seems that every woman out there already has a boyfriend or doesn\u2019t have an hour to spend for a coffee date in their extremely busy weeks.\u00a0\n\nMaybe I\u2019m still too young to be talking about this. I know that some people on this sub are much older than me, but if it hasn\u2019t happened in high school/college so far, I doubt anything\u2019s going to change, given these are supposed to be the \u2018best years\u2019 for finding a partner.\n\nSo I had an epiphany: I\u2019m sure it\u2019s nice to experience having an SO, holding hands and kissing someone you\u2019re really attracted to, having a big group of friends and so forth, but here\u2019s the thing\u2013 you don\u2019t need it. The time I used to spend worrying and ruminating about how I\u2019ve always been single, lonely, and bad with women is time I spent working on my grades, getting in great shape, putting myself in a position to get into the law school of my dreams, doing good deeds, finding a job, and reaching some meaningful accomplishments in my hobbies. I did all of this, and I\u2019m still at it, even without an SO or anyone else to support me, and I\u2019m damn happy about it. From time to time I still think about being FA, but it\u2019s a really small part of my life now. Moral of the story is, if no one wants to spend time with you or appreciate your qualities (whatever they are, your hard work, intelligence, love for movies/cartoons, ANYTHING), it\u2019s their loss, not yours. Use that time for better things. If the \u2018right person\u2019 comes along, great. If not, that\u2019s fine too.\u00a0\n\nThis is by no means a solution to the problem of being FA in and of itself. Sorry about that. It gets infuriating to experience being alone this way, and it feels like nothing you try ever works. But I just wanted to give everyone here encouragement that even if you are FA and feel down as I have for many years, you can still do great things for yourself and those around you. Yea it\u2019s annoying not having a group of friends or a boyfriend/girlfriend by your side, but you can still have a positive and fulfilling life.\u00a0Make travel plans, break new ground in your career.... do anything and everything!\n\nI wanna give everyone here a virtual a bear hug/pat on the back. We will get by!!!\n\nGood luck out there.", "subreddit": "ForeverAlone"}

The house is empty, my parents are away for the weekend and I just broke down out of nowhere thinking of how the empty house will be my future when I move out.\n\nOutside of not being poor, having food, shelter and no serious health issues, not one thing is going right in my life.\n\nI was planning on finally moving out this summer and I figured when I got my promotion at work in February that I could get ready. Well, I haven't gotten the promotion yet, even though I'm doing the work.\n\nHealth wise I have a couple of horribly uncomfortable issues in my private areas. My tailbone gets all damp and stains my underwear and I have trouble urinating, often leading to me having to alleviate myself by grabbing, pulling and pushing my groin area. I've been to a urologist, a physical therapist for almost 2 years now and no one can figure it out. I've had so many tests done and as well with my back side, no doctor or surgeon has a clue so I'm stuck in purgatory.\n\nOh yeah did I mention I also have a sciatic nerve in my leg. Doctor said people your age don't normally get it...this has caused me to be less active and put on weight again.\n\nAll of this is just the entree to the main issue.

Sure it may not work out but I have never been on a single, solitary date in my life. I just can't figure it out.\n\nAt this point, I'm not sure what I should do. All my friends/peers are better off then me. I really took a downturn when I saw my main crush finally got married a month ago. That ended that pipedream of ever happening. I've already been to one friend's wedding and I'm not looking forward to going to everyone else's before I even open the book and go on a date.\n\nYou can forget about kissing or sex, I don't even know what I'll do if it ever happens.

I came to the conclusion that 'I' did not exist. I discovered the philosophical discussion surrounding free will and it allowed me to see how much of an impact people have on who we are. \n\nSociety can be defined as the aggregate of people living together in a more or less ordered community. If you are part of society your identity is a manifestation of its agreed upon morals and values. To give an example, I live in the Netherlands and the majority of the people here are unaffiliated with religion, yet our morals and values are significantly influenced by Christianity. The laws and regulations are all stemming from this foundation and it's still frowned upon to sleep with thy neighbours wife. My point being, people who are born into and are part of society have their life defined by their ancestors. Happiness, success, glory, pain, suffering, I feel you are limited to these categories.\n\nWhat I've attempted the past two years is to isolate myself from people and society as much as possible with the intention of finding my own form of 'happiness' as for lack of a better word. Evidently I didn't succeed and I'll refrain from explaining why because I think I'd be wasting your and my time. However, I do want to know if there are people here who are intentionally alone for a similar reason.\n\nBeing alone is the worst feeling I've ever experienced, yet the most empowering I've ever felt.

I believe this thing that I feel started to develop from way back when I was in middle school. I was that kind of kid who does not have a great body or the ideal height (I was really short, even now I still am) or a good look. I got bullied a lot, I only had several friends that I hung out with, I didn't have any 'close friends' that I can rely on nor someone who would rely or look for me if I went missing for weeks. A couple of years later I made several good friends but that did not last very long because I am the kind of person who always takes the blame even if it has nothing to do with me just because I was really lonely and I felt like I want to be a part of something that matter. I wanted people to know who I am, that I exist in this huge world. That is why I joined several groups of people whom I called my best friends. But then things started to turn ugly real quick. Those whom I called friends started a rumor that I was into their girlfriends and stuff which I never denied, people booed at me for the things I have never done, people called me names, I got punched, pushed and stuff just because I wanted to be a part of their group so badly, because sometimes, just sometimes, they made me feel like they acknowledge me, they made me feel like I do exist; like I am part of something big. This issue led to depression, I felt lonelier than before. But at that time, I can't really do anything, I can't feel better because I have no one to talk to, I do not have enough resources to go to a psychologist nor could I talk to my parents about it, because well, I was that 'stupid', 'ungrateful' and basically useless kid. So talking to my parents would lead to more thoughts about jumping out a building or jumping in front of a bus or maybe cutting myself. By this time, to battle with my own loneliness and depression, I started a business with several of whom I called my close friends to kind of clear my mind of my issues, but then again, things turned ugly real quick. Long story short, I ended up ordering $1000 worth of goods (convinced my mom that my friends would chip in) without any experience in whatsoever related to running a business, got yelled and stuff, because apparently, my close friends were only joking about a deal the 4 of us made of chipping in $250 each. But 3-4 months into running my own business, I got really attached to the business because I successfully turned $1000 into $5000 in less 2 months (real story, I honestly can't believe it myself when my mom told me I made that much because I used my mom's bank account). Since I was really into the business, I started to detach myself from other people, I left my friends texts on purpose, I ghosted my friends for weeks, because well, my own mindset was kind of destroyed. I had that \"I'm not good at friendship, I'm good at running a business, why should I maintain my friendships because everyone is the same, they will use you, then they will leave you when you are no longer useful to them, so why don't I just make money instead of focusing myself to people who will definitely disappoint me?\" mindset. Years later, I realized that kind of mindset was fucked up, but it was rather too late because I have moved to a different school. I left all my friends in middle school without saying goodbye, I ghosted them and never return their text or calls.  I was stuck in my own mindset of 'every single one of them is an asshole and I just need to accept that I will always be lonely'. This keeps on going in my first year of high school even if I tried getting back to being social, but I felt like I know nothing about how to make friends, how to be a good listener, how to be there for someone. My feelings about everyone being an asshole kept on growing because apparently I never got invited to a party, I never got invited to a study group, I was that kid who my classmate always forgot to invite to hang out, I was the kid who always stood at the back of everyone when we were hanging out and had no one to talk too, I was the kid whose birthday they totally forgot about even though one of my classmates has the same exact birth date. This stuff then led to more lonely feelings, depressed and more suicide thoughts. By the age of 15 to 16, I decided that social life is just not my thing, it's something that I would never have, a friend. That decision led to another idea of starting my own business. Long story short, made $10,000 in revenue on the first 6 months. That was when people started coming to me for business advice or just something that would position themselves on an advantage. Which made me feel really used, I felt really angry and sad, and all that mixed feelings about everyone is the same, everyone is an asshole, and I will always be lonely because I have no one to tell stuff to or am I a part of someone's life.   \n\n\nI am now 21, well almost 21, I only have one friend that I would really call my best friend but always have the doubt from the 'everyone is an asshole' mindset that I'm pretty convinced of because its been growing inside of me for 7 years. I always feel like I need assurance, I always ask for assurance that he won't leave me, I always ask myself and him as well 'am I an important part of his life?'. I always feel paranoid and insecure about myself and our friendship. I'll feel down or panic if he does not reply my text for hours, I'll always feel like I did something wrong that pisses him off even if I do realize that I did nothing wrong. I'll be pissed as fuck when he does not look for me when we have not been texting for several weeks or months because he said that I am an important part of his life and when I went and ask why did not he look for me or did he think about me, he would go and say that he did think about looking for me but did nothing in reality. He would go and say something like I am the only one he could talk about anything to but he rarely talks about anything other than stocks. Is it normal to feel this way, to feel like you are so close yet it feels like I don't know him at all? Is it normal to feel like I am something special yet feel lonelier than before when he is around? Am I asking for too much of him or he is just not a good friend? Trust me, he could be really sweet, he would come and visit me on my birthday even though we live in a different city, he would be really good to me at times, he would be there when I need him, but most of the times he would just be like a regular guy or he would not even be here. This is fucking my mind up. I honestly do not know what to do. Do you call someone your close friend if most of the time he just does not give a fuck about your existence and would actually make you feel worse about yourself when he is around?\n\nAnyways, if you have any suggestion or any advice on how do I deal with my loneliness, depression, or friendship, please do reply or send me a message (I'll figure it out later). If you don't that is totally fine and thank you very much for reading everything. This is very hard for me because I have no one to talk to.", "subreddit": "lonely"}

Angry, frustrated tears sort of leak out, but sobbing? Almost never.\nNothing can manage to wring it out of me except my dreams.\n\nIt isn't often, thank fuck, but every now and again, my brain sees fit to whip up a nightmare of humiliation so vividly real I have to test that I'm not still in a dream when I wake.\n\nLast night, I had a dream where I met an old acquaintance from highschool on campus. I remembered she got along well with me and it wasn't any different this time. We talked and everything was great for a while. Days passed in my head as we grew closer and closer. Eventually, she invited me over to her apartment dorm and we got even closer. But this is where the pain starts.\n\nI should have realized it was a dream by now, but no, I haven't got the gift. So as payment, I saw a laptop on her bed opened to a sex cam account and sex toys everywhere. I asked nervously about it and she admitted quite happily that she did camming and she had just finished a show before meeting me that day. My heart sort of sunk at this point. I wasn't really anything special to her, obviously. I was heavily out of my league as well. Kinky as I am, no fucking experience compared to her.\n\nShe practically jumped on me after that, impatient to get things hot and heavy. All the while, I awkwardly fumble to take off clothes and try my best to please her. After a while of that, I finally felt happy again but it was all a trap. Set up for the fall. She excused herself and disappeared into the bathroom and while I waited, the door rattled.\n\nSome massive asshole saunters in as if it was his place, and lays his eyes on me. It was as akward as you can imagine. But soon he began jokingly harrasing me about pretty much everything. Who am I? Why do I look like that? How the fuck did you get in here? Is she really fucking you? Yada yada yada it goes until she walks out and responds to him with a simple, \"Not today. Go.\"\n\nHe whines about the last time and how, \"if you're fucking him, why not me?\" Does she say no and push him out? Hah, if only. She replies with, \"fine, just wait outside or something\". Only he doesn't. He walks deeper into the apartment and calls out to her saying he would be right there if I tried anything. She was safe.\n\nNow, does she stop our little hangout and tend to the guy? No. She continues with me as if nothing happened. Needless to say, I was far from into it anymore. So I grabbed my shit and apologized. She was more frustrated than sad, and even pushed me outside, half naked.\n\nI changed in the hallway, headed back to my car in the middle of the night, and took out my phone. Wanna guess what I did? I posted to r/foreveralone.\n\nYeah that's right, in my dream, I was still FA. I posted about the event and then I curled up in my car and sobbed.\n\nThen I woke up. Sobbing and drooling over my pillow. And now I'm posting. Hating myself for beig weak. Hating my sadistic or masochistic brain for even making this happen. It's happened before and it will again. Maybe some night when I'm all alone after a bender, it will gift me a nightmare like this and maybe, just maybe, I'll use that rage and anguish to fucking end this charade once and for all.

From the outside it looks like I'm doing fine. I'm 25 years old, graduated engineering school, got a relatively high paying job out of college, and I'm doing well for myself. But in reality I don't like my job and I rarely do anything social outside of work. I've never had a girlfriend. Most of my college friends are far away such that I can only see them on occasion. The ones that are close by rarely want to do anything. All of the friends that I have made in the area such as through work are superficial and don't really know me. Generally speaking for the past 5 years at least my day to day mood has ranged from emptiness to depression. Any feeling of happiness has been relatively short lived and overall life feels meaningless and I cant foresee any likely scenario that would change this.\n\nI guess recently a string of bad weeks has put me in this sad mood. Labor day weekend I was really sick and couldn't do anything, which sucked because some of my friends were doing stuff. \n\nThe following weekend I went back to my parents house to attend a wedding of a family friend. My entire family lives in the area and since I went to college I've only seen my 2 older brothers and my older sister during breaks such as Christmas. I was still a little sick from the week prior and my brothers get extremely paranoid when someone's sick so I neglected to see them until the wedding, even though I had taken a few days off. When I finally saw my brothers at the wedding it was like I barely knew them. My brothers tend to exclusively hang out with each-other when they're together so I should've expected it, but still, I literally grew up with them and hadn't seen them in a year and its like I didn't even know them. Not to mention that I didnt know the vast majority of the people at the wedding. My brothers end up leaving the wedding early without telling anyone and I just get drunk off of the open bar (I usually don't drink at all).\n\nFast forward to this weekend. My 2 favorite EDM DJs are having concerts Thursday and Friday in my town which is especially crazy because I don't live in an area where you'd expect to have big concerts. I knew about this months in advance and had bought tickets really early. One of my brothers is also a huge fan of the Thursday guy and a couple months ago he said he'd come up with his old college roommate who I know. These plans fell apart at the last minute. The Monday of that week, my brother had told me that he didn't buy a ticket and he couldn't take off work that Friday so he couldn't go. He said his roommate had bought the ticket but couldn't go because he had a bachelor party he had to go to that he forgot about. \n\nI had also asked all of my friends in the area a few weeks ago. All of them said no to Thursday either due to having plans or not liking the genre of music. One particular denial hit me hard. I had asked my closest friend to multiple different concerts each time he came up with an excuse for why he couldn't go, such as he's doing something with his family. And I really didn't have any reason to doubt him. This time he flat out said that even though he likes the music, he's \"not a concert guy\". Which would normally be fine but it rubs me the wrong way for 2 reasons. First it makes me think that he was lying the other times he said he didnt want to do things. The second is because whenever we do hang out, probably his number one thing he wants to do is go to bars and dance. I usually go along with it even though I hate the mainstream music they play at bars. \n\nSo I end up going to the concert alone. I'm able to have a good time at the concert but as soon as it ends and I leave its like a light switch and I'm back to that empty lonely state.   \n\n\nThen the Friday concert.\n\nSo I did the same thing with the Friday concert as the Thursday one. I had asked all the same friends, but this time the only people who had said yes were some friends from work. I asked a bunch of people, but I specifically focused on my closest work friend. We had gone out to bars before and he's a really outgoing social person so it seemed like he'd be interested. So he never wanted to give me a straight answer, often switching the topic whenever I brought it up. He waits until the week of the concert to start giving me an answer, but he flip flops multiple times. On Monday he starts off by saying he wants to but he cant afford it, which I don't buy because we make approximately the same amount of money because we're both new hires. That and also he's willing to spend a lot more on a casual night of drinking. That same day we find out that you can get discounted tickets. So he says he'd be willing to go with the discount. So we plan on meeting at my place after work then heading to the concert. Then Friday morning, he texts me saying that he's not going because he didn't buy his ticket yet and the discount ended on Wednesday. This made me feel like shit cuz I had just gotten blown off two nights in a row. I took Friday off so I could sleep in after the Thursday concert and so I could clean my apartment because people were coming over, but now that nobody was coming I just did nothing all day. Then at 4pm he says that he's going again and that he invited a few of his friends from out of town, none of which I know.  \n\n\nSo the work friend goes back to his apartment after work to get changed and whatnot. He lives approximately 40 minutes away from my apartment. I live approximately 10 minutes away from the concert. The concert starts at 8pm doors open 7pm. I looked up the supporting acts and I would've liked to see all of them, but I specifically wanted to see the guy who went on at 8:40, all of which I let my friend know. We plan on meeting at my place at 7pm. I rush out to clean the apartment and get some stuff at the liquor store because I don't have anything because I usually don't drink. 7pm rolls around and nobody's here, so I call my friend. He said that the guys from out of town had a late start and are headed to his apartment, expected to get there around 8pm. I propose that everybody can come directly to my place IF they can get here by 8pm (which might actually be the case because of traffic around my friend's place). Otherwise, we should just meet at the concert. I also remind my friend that it takes approximately 40 minutes to get from his place to my place. I hang up at around 7:10. Then at 8pm, nobody's here. I call my friend again and he says that he hasnt left his apartment yet and his friends are 25 minutes away from my place. I tell him to fuck off and I'm leaving and locking my apartment. He's mad at me for doing this because I was the one who suggested this idea, ignoring the fact that I said if they can get here by 8. He then tells his friends to turn around and go to his apartment, even though at that point they could've just went straight to the concert. And I end up going to the Friday concert alone as well. As a side note I had to watch half of the 8:40 act from a distance because getting through the security check took so long.   \n\n\nAnd again the concert was fun but at the same time I couldn't shake the feeling that I was there alone. It sucks. I hardly see the people that I care about. When I do see them it doesnt go as well as I hoped. I can make new friends because of shit like this. Not to mention the other stuff that I haven't gone into like my job (this post is already too long). And then it also seems like nobody I encounter shares any interests, even my close friends from college. It just seems incredibly unlikely that something will work out and in all likelihood I'm doomed to this empty existence.", "subreddit": "lonely"}

Idaho Falls, IA - really cool, cozy neighborhoods with super cheap mansions and the also some of the nicest people I've met.\n* 9). West Yellowstone, MT - sleepy tourist lodging town.  Really cozy too, but extremely expensive since I got stuck here on a weekend no less!\n* 10). Yellowstone National Park, WY - really kickass, the photos online don't do it justice.  It was hard picking what to do since I was only here for a few days.  Preferred the off-menu options to tourist-traps like Old Faithful.\n* 11). Grand Tetons National Park, WY - see above, loved the off-menu options, glad I didn't get stuck in Jackson Hole with all the rich people.\n* 12). Reno, NV - passed through here on my way back to the Bay Area, a dumpier version of Las Vegas.  Reminded me too much of Victorville.\n* 13). Sacramento, CA - been here before but love the awesome mexican food here too.\n\nI learned a lot not just about the US, but about myself on my trip:\n\n(a) I really like travelling alone and on my own schedule.  I don't mind sightseeing alone because I met a lot of nice people along the way.  Didn't meet any women who seemed interested in me, and I am thinking I am finally ok with that now.  But being alone in restaurants doesn't have to be awkward unless you let it - people are too wrapped up in their own concerns to care about some ugly asshole dining alone (and even if they did, why would it matter to me anyway?).\n\n(b) I didn't encounter any racism travelling through some of the whitest parts of the US as a puerto rican man.  Starting to think the news media, politicians, and Twitter might be full of shit about half the country being White Supremacists.\n\n(c) I should have done this a long time ago.  Definitely going to do it again, except next time up the pacific northwest since my leads on the Grimorum point to some tiny ass town in Washington State, coincidentally up the I-5.\n\n(d) Technically speaking, my travels took me through seven states since I-15 passes through Arizona briefly and West Yellowstone is technically in Montana.  But those are technicalities as far as I am concerned since W. Yellowstone is literally on the border and there's nothing in AZ I saw in the 20 minutes I spent driving through it.\n\nFeel free to ask any questions you'd like about my experience.

For a long time I've struggled with finding out what's wrong with me and I've usually just told myself that I am intrinsically bad. Earlier this year I worked at some delivery place before I get into college and had a talk with the driver about myself and he said that I come off as naive. I didn't know quite what to make of this and forgot it until I started college. Up until this point I've been a neet and haven't had friends since I was 17 (I'm 21 now) and I had issues socialising with others and making friends and thought I was just unlovable. At church people would look at me with contempt and I ended up leaving the church and Christianity all together. But then I started college and talked with some of the girls and was surprised at how good and sociable I was. I would talk with literally whoever was next to me whether girl or boy, ugly or cute and it would go well. I was very likable and they would in turn ask my questions about where I'm from or what's my name and be genuinely interested in me. I make girls laugh and overall enjoy being around me. But I realised that this didn't translate to outside of the classroom. The others would not want to be seen with me in public. They would try to hide themselves from being seen with me in public and even the girls wouldn't. This made me think back to the thing the guy told me about being naive. I do come off as quite childish. I'm able to even be friends with some of the more street kids in my class but because I come off as a somewhat of a goofy 10 year old I think people want to make me their little secret.\n\nI don't wanna make this post too long but all I'm asking is how do I become more grown? Like, how do I be more assertive and not come off as naive. I want to be aggressive and dominant. Not just a joker. How do I change?

{"post_id": "d7yekf", "created_utc": 1569195498, "title": "Please help", "author": "MJtheMC", "self_text": "     6 months ago my wife started learning Spanish. She was doing really good so I told her to check out Interpals to find spanish women to talk with. She told me she met an \"evangelist\" from India. She said she wanted to send his church a box of old clothes for winter, and I thought nothing else of it. Fast forward 2-3 months. I notice her Google Hangouts app is up on her desktop PC and there are no chats in it. I asked her why that was up. My wife is not a tech-savy person so it would be work for her to download the desktop app. She shrugged it off and so did I. A couple weeks later I asked her if she was talking to the India man still. She said no, but when she said it I could tell she was lying. I really wouldn't have a problem with her talking to someone on the other side of the planet, but lying was odd. Imagine being with someone 8-9 years and being able to tell when they lie easily. So I honestly shrug it off for about a week. The following week it starts bugging me. I know it's an invasion of privacy but I put a keylogger on her computer. I know, I know. I read what she had been saying. She was telling this man she loved him. I was furious. I confronted her. She lied about it 3 times, when I asked if she was still talking with him. The 4th time I told her what she had said to him and I know what she said. She still lied and had a pure look of shame on her face. She admitted it that night and told me she would stop talking to him. I said ok. But again I checked the messages. She told him that she couldn't live without him, and it doesn't matter what I say she will always love him. I confront her again. She's obviously pissed about me reading messages. Note this whole time we are NOT arguing we are being adults and talking about this. I pretty much tell her fuck it just have a boyfriend if this is what you want (testing her). She says no she must stop talking with him. That she will send one package a year and one letter on his birthday.... barf. And she says she wants privacy and for me to not read this time. Of course I read. She tells him that he is her soulmate, that she will always love him. You have to understand, no matter what you believe my wife is a highly \"Christian\" woman. So I start giving her Bible verses after confronting her again. I say there is no way you could love us both and that she does not love me anymore. She tells me she does not want a divorce and wants to stay together. She deletes everything and tells me she's done for good. She kept hidden folders on her desktop PC with pictures and video messages. She constantly deletes her email trash. Again. My wife is not a tech-savy person. Deleting her trash in her email is suspect. I figure she probably still talks with him. And honestly I don't care. If she doesn't love me it is what it is. I am just sad because we have a 2 year old son. He is such a good kid and I do not want him to go thru that divorced family shit. But honestly I don't see a point in staying in a relationship with someone that does not love me, and has proved she is a blind faced liar and will lie to my face even when there is proof.  \n\n     So a couple months goes by. Again I know she is talking with the man still. Or still loving him, whatever. So out of nowhere I meet a woman from Egypt. She is a model and she is a nice person. We fall in love. We talk multiple times a day. The tables have turned. But this woman tells me she cannot be with me or marry me if I am a Christian and do not convert to Islam. So now I am sitting here losing my mind. Holding on by a string just to keep my son happy. Because at the end of the day he is ALL that matters. We're in a crazy situation and I think I am going to pay off what little debt we have and divorce her. She will probably have to move in with her mom, and I will probably have to live in my car until I can buy a house. If I even want to buy a house. I'm not sure I want to. I'm just feeling very strange. And these religions, and how people use them are really strange... just feeling alone... i have told no1. My best friend just went through a divorce and he's kind of a messed up person. If I tell him he will probably be happy it is happening to me.", "subreddit": "lonely"}

I shower once or twice a week (at best), wear the same clothes for days on end, and have yet to open a fresh tube of toothpaste that's been sitting on the counter for months. My messy environment doesn't help, either. I've found dirty sushi trays trapped under my bed on more than one occasion.\n\nSecondly, I don't have any friends.\n\nWell, that's not entirely true. I have one friend who lives down the street from me, yet we haven't seen each other face-to-face in literal months, and my anxiety keeps me away from texting him. So, yeah. One friend, whom I haven't seen since June. It probably doesn't help that I'm homeschooled, either.\n\nI know some of you are thinking, \"Well, why don't you go out and make them?\" And I want to. The thing is, I just can't. I cannot set foot in a public area without having a massive panic attack, provided it's located anywhere near my former school. I'm fine with going out in totally alien areas, so long as no one tries to talk to me, in which case the anxiety gets almost unbearable.\n\nI do have meds to treat it. My psychiatrist prescribed me extremely low doses of hydroxyzine. They are supposed to be taken situationally, and I would, if my mom would let me have access to them. I think she's afraid I'll get addicted or overdose, which is practically impossible at this dosage. We've brought it up to the psychiatrist, and he sides with me, but she still won't listen.\n\nMy only interactions with non-family members are with biweekly group therapy sessions. Surprisingly, those go swimmingly. It seems I can't hold a conversation with anyone who isn't mentally ill to some degree...\n\nI don't particularly want to be in a relationship. I've never really felt the urge to be in one. Back when I was in public school, some people would hint about their feelings toward me, and I just wouldn't care. That said, having a girlfriend would probably help to some degree, at least until the inevitable breakup. I'm woefully irresponsible, so I'd probably end up dragging the person down.\n\nI think I'm just gonna cut it off here. This post was supposed to be a \"help me\" affair, but at this point it's become the ramblings of a total lunatic (he he).\n\nTL;DR: At this point, my social life is a lost cause.", "subreddit": "lonely"}

I do want to clarify a few things though. First, I'm not looking for people to feel bad for me as this happened years ago and I laugh about it now. Second, I'm currently don't feel as lonely as I did when I was 19 when this happened, but I do consider it one of my loneliest times in my life. Third, I hope that this helps people who feel lonely know that it does eventually get better.\n\nSo this was either my first or second semester in college and break was coming up. I had a group of friends back then and I talked to one of my friends who lived in the dorms to about having a movie night with pizza before break starts since some of the people in the group lived hours away making it hard to hang out. Since I considered myself the host I offered to buy the pizza and bring the movies. When getting the other people in the group to come most were able to go. Now this wasn't anything really new as we've done stuff like this before, but the only difference is that most of the people in our group were in a relationship with either someone else in the group or someone outside of the group. I was not one of those people.\n\nNow, I obviously invited the other single people in the minority of the group with them saying they'll try to go but might not be able to. For a week leading up to the movie night I was thinking to myself \"man, wouldn't it suck if I was the only single person at the movie night\" well let's just say welcome to self fulfilling prophecy. None of my other friends who were single were able to come so movie night was 9 people with 8 of them with their SO. In other words I pretty much created a quadruple date for my friends. Congratulations past me, you played yourself.\n\nNow I'm someone who doesn't like to ask people to give me money and I already offered to pay for the pizza so not only did I set up a quadruple date, I was paying for it *epic facepalms*. Now because the pizza place we were ordering from was too far away to get delivered I went to grab the pizza alone which was kind of a good thing. On the way to the pizza place I remember crying almost the entire 25 to 30 minute drive there as I felt completely distraught. I kept asking myself all the questions like \"why can't I get a gf?\" And so on but in an ugly crying tone. I still ended up having to wait for the pizza to be made when I got there which was definitely a good thing because it gave me time to collect myself. On my way back I did eat a couple of slices, because I paid for the pizza, but I was wondering if I was even missed or if my friends knew how lonely I felt.\n\nWhen I got back I tried my best to act happy and like I was having a good time. I couldn't really leave early because I was the host. I don't remember much specifics after that other than a few things. During one of the movies all the couples were cuddling with each other during one if the movies and I had to just try my best to ignore it and focus on the film. One of my friends there jokingly asked if I wanted to cuddle with him and his boyfriend. I probably answered with something like \"nah, I'm good.\" In a positive manner or as close to positive as I could produce. As the night ended I was left to clean up with my friends helping out but I left the dorms feeling sad and tired.\n\nAfterwards, the one friend whose dorm building we were having it in mentioned that he and his gf at the time noticed how I was kind of left out socially. Now, like I said I laugh about it now even though I still don't have a gf I learned to get over it and try to enjoy life as is with the close friends I have. If there's a moral of the story I guess it would be either don't let your relationship status stop you from enjoying yourself or don't set up a quadruple date for your friends without you having a date yourself. If you made it this far thanks for reading, it feels good to get this stuff out.\n\nTL;DR: In college I set up a quadruple date for my friends where I was the host and paid for it.", "subreddit": "lonely"}

We share some mutual acquaintances and frequent some of the same places. I flirted with her a bit and she flirted back. I tried to see if things could go any further. \u201cWould you like to go to \u2018x\u2019 with me?\u201d \u201cYou mention such-and-such a place. I like there too.

I didn\u2019t think it was and just thought it was just bad days, but after the second week of feeling shit I realised I was going through a low mood. So I acknowledged and owned it which is what I spoke about to you. I had such awareness of what was going on - negative thoughts warping me thoughts of reality.

I\u2019m finding it difficult to express in words, but I guess I mean how you don\u2019t judge or care about how relationships \u2018should be\u2019 aka immature views of the man doing everything and spoiling you. True love when you get to the core is just spending time with each other is what you\u2019ve shown me. I appreciate that because I know when I feel anxious I reach to others for validation and reassurance, my relationship with Charlie can be viewed as \u2018youre both different\u2019 or \u2018not long term\u2019. Peoples opinions on someone else\u2019s love is irrelevant. They aren\u2019t in the relationship and don\u2019t know it. My biggest concern with Charlie is that I think things as cliche as it sounds are too good to be true. It\u2019s my most honest and vulnerable relationship so I\u2019m scared of getting hurt and overwork things.\nBut ENOUGH OF THAT! That\u2019s the problem, I forgot what charlie also is. My best friend who I have been super neglecting because I let the term of \u2018boyfriend\u2019 Be such a worry for me.

She\u2019s lazy. She has been living with me for some time, and for more than half I have been supporting her because she\u2019s too lazy to get a job. She hasn\u2019t made an effort with me. She doesn\u2019t touch me. She has put on a whole load of weight. She doesn\u2019t take care of herself. Doesn\u2019t do her part with the house work. It\u2019s a strain.\n\nLet\u2019s call \u201cher\u201d Grace.\n\nSo I feel like I\u2019m holding onto what was the fun aspect at the beginning of the relationship. That excitement you get. The honeymoon stage. Maybe I love the idea. Not her. At least not anymore. She walks all over me. Uses me. I\u2019m just a welcome mat that pays the food and rent bills. And I\u2019m sick and tired of being sick and tired. I work myself to the bone and still can\u2019t afford all the bills.\n\nI spoke to her. \n\nI told her I feel like this between us isn\u2019t going anywhere. I\u2019m not happy. I don\u2019t feel it anymore. That I want to try and work at it. That it\u2019s a two way street.\n\nConveniently I think she\u2019s forgot about that long conversation that lasted for hours over a night of tears. A night of raw emotion. She cried, I cried. but for a moment I could almost believe that she was trying to understand and that she would work to help. That was the best part of 3 months ago.\n\nBut I want to love her.\n\nI cringe when she leans in for a kiss. I have to force myself to stop a recoil from an embrace. Everything she does frustrates me. Infuriates me. This isn\u2019t how I imagined to be spending my life at 22. In constant need for money. I haven\u2019t even experienced anything yet and I\u2019m still waiting and waiting for something to pop out of the woodwork and give me a damn break.\n\nBut I want to love her!\n\nOr I\u2019m just indifferent. I just don\u2019t care enough. I promise I\u2019m human. I\u2019m not heartless. I\u2019m just tired.\n\nI used to hang on every word she said like it was gold dust. Now she just bores me half to death. I am not interested in how her day is going. If her day at work was okay. Her sadness and feeling have just become an inconvenience that I feel obliged to listen to because I am in a relationship and that\u2019s what\u2019s the done thing. Right?\n\nI want someone to want to touch me. I want someone I want to touch. I\u2019m so lonely.\n\nI feel so lost. And don\u2019t know what avenue to take. Am I at a fork in the road or a dead end? Am I doing this to myself or is Grace a contribution?\n\nNaturally, I turned to a friend. She has helped me through so much. She\u2019s pulled me out of some dark places and even laid into me a few times when she knows I need the kick up the ass. \u201cYou deserve better\u201d. \u201cGrace doesn\u2019t treat you right\u201d. And all the statements that go hand in hand from a friend that cares. And I know all this. Somewhere I\u2019m sure I know.\n\nBut I wanted to love her.\n\nGrace slags off my whole family and lays into my little brother. She's so nasty. My mom has been paying for her too at this point.\n\nBut now here comes the cherry, sprinkles and icing one the cake.\n\nThe friend that gives all the support and love unconditionally? Spends time with me? Makes the effort with my incredibly autistic brother and is loved by my whole family? \n\nI love her too.\n\nFar more than I should. More than is acceptable for a person already in a commited relationship is allowed to love someone else. The way I love her.\nI don\u2019t feel lonely when I\u2019m with her. She held my hand and I\u2019m weak. She hugs me and I have those fireworks all over.\nMaybe I\u2019m wrong? Maybe I am confusing my feelings for her because I\u2019ve never had someone support me the way she does. I\u2019ve never felt this way.\nI know I should feel guilty. I know I am a horrific human being. But I can\u2019t help it.\nApparently my autism makes it difficult to know what emotions are.

I know they're linked ... but they're disparate in many ways. I crave human companionship, but I push people away (both unconsciously and deliberately) out of a mixture of social anxiety and self-loathing. I don't want to be alone forever; however at the same time, I don't want to settle for \u201cgood enough\u201d and wind up faking friendships with people I genuinely dislike.\n\nSo: happiness. I know that I can experience happiness. I don't suffer from anhedonia. I can smile at the tender kiss of a warm sunbeam on my face. I can smile at the hot, sweetly green scent of freshly cut grass. I can smile at the joyful, random, chirps of prelapsarian birdsong. The innocence of untouched nature pleases me, soothes my fears, and quiets my anxieties. I love the tickle of lush, thick grass on my bare feet. In isolation, I can be happy. But people \u2026 well, I don't *hate* people. But \u2026 \n\nVerbs are more important than nouns. I don't hate people; but I do hate much of what people *do*. I hate the judging, the criticizing, the offering of unsolicited opinion and advice. \n\nCompanionless, I am free from blame, free from shame, free from castigation and reprimand over what I have done and what I have left undone. Alone, I am lonely \u2026 yes. But I relish the lonely liberty of being set free from the stigma of social guilt \u2013 the constant stream of disapproving opinions about my missed opportunities, unfulfilled potential, my faults and failures, my dishonors and disgraces. I have not forgotten these! Do I need the chattering voices of others (weak, stained, and tarnished mortals \u2013 just like yours truly!) standing in judgment, offering their contempt, their criticism, their denouncements of me? I live 24/7 with my failures. I see the unvarnished truth of the incompetent, underachieving, washout I am every time I look in the mirror \u2026 as Cromwell said to Sir Peter: \u201cwarts and all!\u201d I've always been a good-for-nothing dud *in the eyes of others* \u2013 I know that. I do not need reminding of it. Trust me: I'm working on it. I sincerely desire to improve myself. The carping judgments and unsolicited opinions are neither necessary nor helpful.\n\nFree from the verbs (the actions, the speeches, the judgments of others), I can enjoy the glow of happiness that is solitude. The nouns (sunbeam, grass, birdsong) can be appreciated. Perhaps, far enough away from the nagging babble of belittling faultfinders (\u201cfriends,\u201d family, strangers on the Internet), I can slowly start to re-appreciate *Homo sapiens* \u2026 we're really not all that bad, are we? I mean, when we're not quibbling, complaining, and tearing us other down \u2026 we have potential to do good? I really want to be able to like people, to enjoy socializing, to embrace friendships and celebrate all that is positive, good, wondrous, and delightful about the companionship others have to offer. That ought to be realistic for anyone to achieve; but what do I know? \n\nYou see, in knowing *loneliness* I've simultaneously confessed to *not knowing* human nature. Maybe I'm wrong about everything? Maybe I've created an idealistic, naive, fantasy world where people are better than they really are? Maybe I'm an ignorantly over-optimistic Pollyanna? As paradoxical as that sounds coming from someone as antisocial as myself, it still seems within the realm of possibility. I still have far more questions than answers about life, the universe, and everything. And I know that I've got a long, long row to hoe if I'm ever going to improve myself and finally grow into being a decent, functioning member of society. I really want to try, though. It will be hard work \u2026 but I really want to try. It seems like a worthwhile goal (albeit one that still sits oh so very, very far from where I stand). I don't really wish to remain both lonely and unhappy from here on out.", "subreddit": "lonely"}

We literally always talked about our problems and we were always there to help each other, as we are now even if we are so far. It was amazing, I didn't feel alone at all, even with all the bullies, having them for me was the best thing in the world and was just making everything less though.\n\nThis probably led me to be that kind of person who hates superficial relationships, and always looks for deep bounds and tries to give as much as he can to someone else (yeah, got my back stabbed many times for this reason, you can imagine, but I just keep doing that: why? Don't know, I am just like this.\nI hope that people love me as I love them, sometimes it works: like 3 on 10.)\n\nSometime ago things started changing a bit in my life.\nI have a girlfriend and she makes me happy, most of the time, got some \"friends\", so I am not really alone, I am not in a drastic situation.\n\nThough nside me it's growing the need of having people around, and honestly I don't feel like I want to be ashamed of this, but it makes me a bit curious and worried and I want to talk about it.\n\nWhile since some months ago I could stay an entire week or month by myself, home, minding my business, now I can't stay more than a couple of nights by myself without starting to think that I feel alone and I want someone to talk, to do something. (I don't live with my girlfriend, and she does have her life so can't really bother her every moment I've got this stuff in my head, and honestly in the world we live today I really think she would just think I am a loser to think stuff like this.)\n\nAnd it's not so easy to build relationships obviously, most of the times people will just avoid contact during week, I don't know maybe for work stress or tiredness, probably, that I don't really feel most of the times (even if I work full time).\n\nI think that nowadays it seems like everybody just wants to live in their bubble completely isolated from everyone: why?

At this point I had no reason to lie, so I told her the truth. She without any hesitation told me to get into her car. She took me to her place and proceeded to watch over me all night, talking to me, trying to cheer me up. I eventually fell asleep waking up at around 8 the next morning. She was still there, sitting next to me making sure I was safe from myself. She stayed up the entire night just to make sure I was safe, this nearly complete stranger saved my life. After this we started hanging out a a lot, and we quickly realized that we were essentially the same person. From there we quickly fell in love with each other.

Only my third day and I started crying when I got in the car and then I went home and had a halfhearted phone conversation and slept for 3 hours. I'm overeating again- I don't know why this is happening now and not in response to other stressors but okay. I can't pick out my clothes. I feel sick all the time, just wrought with loneliness and fear.\n\nI've been doing all my work but am currently withholding turning it in because I'm thinking about purposefully failing school 1. as a statement about how fucking stupid hs diplomas are and 2. so my parents will take my phone and stuff and I won't be allowed to go out again. I know despite how everything feels I still have friends that want me and if I do that I'm pretty much saying goodbye to our friendship. I'm losing my shit in a world I don't and never have belonged in. I wish my parents didn't love me so much so I could leave peacefully. I want to be free so bad.", "subreddit": "lonely"}

I\u2019ve grown bitter, resentful, jealous, and envious of their success; particularly, those who have made it out and continue to post/comment here.  The thing is, I don\u2019t want to be like this, so over the past week I\u2019ve been actively trying to be less..hateful.  I\u2019ve looked at couples and told myself not to scowl, I\u2019ve tried not to think of every cute person that I come across in terms of what \u201ccould be\u201d because that inevitably leads to resentment that it isn\u2019t.\n\nMy question is: does anyone have advice about how to stick with these changes and be a bit more positive?  I don\u2019t mean tips like \u201cbe happy for others\u201d, because I\u2019m definitely not in that place.  I don\u2019t want to actively give my happiness and energy to people who have what I want, but I want to stop feeling bitter about not having it and at least be able to look past them, if that makes sense.

A story about how I found my soulmate, lost my soulmate. and how I deal with having the chance to be with her again. Why am I doing this? Mostly because I need an outlet, also because I need some advice, and also because I have developed a crippling sense of loneliness that makes life a chore.\n\nThis is going to be long. Probably, an essay about being young, love, loss, and pain. I do NOT expect you to read it all. If you do, I salute you. I just want this story out there so I don\u2019t feel trapped anymore.\n\nHere we go: \nIn my Junior year of high school, I met this girl a year below me. Now, I hate stereotypes, but for the sake of reference and the fact that you\u2019ve never met her or seen her, lets say that as for her physical appearance, she looked like your classic white sorority girl. Perfect body, beautiful smile, etc. You get the picture. However as for her personality, she was quiet, mature, thoughtful, and very down to earth. Moreover, her friend were good people too. As you may have guessed, I instantly was head over heels for her. \n\nI want to mention here that I went to high-school in the south and am a lanky middle-eastern/canadian and one of four brown people in a school of 600. So naturally, I felt that this girl was way way out of my league. However, I forged on. I\u2019d like to say that I made an effort to be her friend and flirt with her and win her over with romance and humor, but that would be lying. One day, before Spanish class, I noticed she was dead silent, her hair was a mess, massive pout across her face, so I walked up to her and asked what was wrong. \n\nBest choice of my damn life. Instantly, we became close. She moved to sit next to me the class after. She gave me her number, FaceTimed me often, I was so shocked. We realized we had a lot in common which was awesome! However, we were still just friends. One day she invited me over, and we baked cookies for a bake sale. It was wonderful. After we made cookies, we watched Captain America: Winter Soldier and after awhile she just curled up next to me and out her arm across me and her head into my shoulder and we cuddled until I had to leave.\n\nI almost crashed three times on the way home because my mind was racing. I had trouble comprehending it. Was it possible that this beautiful white girl actually liked ME?! (I hate to bring race into this, but I have faced a lot of discrimination bc of my skin color, and told often that the chances of me getting w a girl like that were 0 just because of my skin color).\n\nWe hung out again. and lets just say uh things went farther than cuddling. No, not sex, but darn close. So at this point we were both a bit awkward. We had no idea what came over us, but in the end we agreed that we loved it. However, I saw where this was going, so I just blurted out I liked her one day while going to get lunch. She blinked and smiled and said, I like you too. Thus began the happiest three years of my life. I won\u2019t bore you with the details, but it was a committed, healthy, and loving relationship that got through anything in our path. \n\nFor the first time in my young life, I felt so alive and grounded. Strong relationships with friends and family, strong romantic relationship, I felt on top of the world.\n\nCollege was always a scary thing for us. We both knew it was coming, but didn\u2019t want it to be the end. We largely just chose to focus on being happy and \u201cin the now\u201d.  Fast forward to February 2018, heading towards me graduating, we are chilling in the back of my car and all of a sudden she burst into tears. I am confused and ask whats wrong, and she explains how she is so scared of how to deal with me leaving for college. I had just chosen to attend school in Canada, thus requiring me to move out of country. Honestly, a completely understandable crisis. Theres two choices: you call it quits, or you attempt the long distance. Of course we were going to stick together or at least try to. However, she was hysterical, and asked me to promise her that no matter what happened, if we were both available after we graduate, that I would come back to her/she would come back to me. Honestly, for me, there was no hesitation, and I said of course. That solved that issue.\n\nLets skip graduation, and summer. Not much happened, happiness and rainbows as usual.\n\nGoing to university. It was new for me, I was SO nervous. However, I had this special someone to comfort me and I used that as a crutch. I would text her, facetime her, and give her attention because at the time she was the only person who instantly connected with me. However, this led to me not having any friends. I went out and partied, but always without people to hang with. Classes began, and so did the workflow. At the same time, extreme depression started to develop. September goes by, A- average in classes, still good with my gal\u2019, making loose friends, life was okay. \n\nIn October, I went to visit her. I had a blast. Such a sweet time. I took her to her senior homecoming. We had a wonderful, wonderful time.\n\nHowever, after I went back, the problems started. I think a very big factor in this was anxiety and separation anxiety on her part. For her, I was her rock when her mom would continually verbally abuse her. Id be there to hug her, make sure she felt loved, and overall feel safe. I think being in high school, but not having me there made her feel empty. This was the beginning of the end, but I can understand why.\n\nShe should\u2019ve broken up with me at the end of October, but she clearly desperately wanted to make it work and she stayed until she couldn\u2019t anymore, I can understand how hard it can get. In the months leading up to this, my roomate was getting on my nerves, he was an extreme pothead who kept irregular hours, so my room smelt like weed 24/7 and he was up until 5am every night. Moreover, I was keenly feeling having no friends. I often felt empty. Watching people on Snapchat go clubbing and hit the frats, or just be watching movies with people. I also gained weight. Food helped me cope. It made me feel happy. I couldn\u2019t help it. I also keenly felt my relationship slipping. Not because of anything bad, just because of distance. My grades TANKED. I started skipping class because I couldn\u2019t get out of bed in the morning. You get the picture, I slid into and hit rock bottom. \n\nFast forward December. Exams time. At this point, my one chance to at least pass all my classes. I scraped enough money together to visit my girl. If I could get through this, life would take a turn for the better. I didn\u2019t. Two days before exams started, she broke up with me. A dick move? Of course. However, she was broken and depressed. It was affecting her mental health not having me there, and she didn\u2019t know why she needed me to physically be there, because she was desperately in love with me, but regardless it was affecting her. I couldn\u2019t argue. I loved her, and above all else put her health first. I said okay, I respect you, I love you. I need space. I hope God brings us together again. \n\nI tanked my exams. Failed my entire first semester. I was a mess. However, I refused to get help. This may sound odd, but the alarm bell for my parents was when I stopped maintaining my appearance. I religiously trimmed my beard, faded my hair, dressed extremely well, and all of that stopped. I became a walking vessel of depression. To be clear, I have never had that much love in my life, even from my parents. When I found someone who gave me her whole heart, I ate that shit up, loved it more than anything. It was gone, and I was alone.\n\nLooking back, I realize that once she was gone, I was truly alone. No girlfriend, no friends, failed classes, fat, disheveled, depressed, nothing to live for honestly. Not even a hobby. My second semester went much the same except....I MADE FRIENDS around March. I was so happy, there was light in my life again. However, she contacted me after all this time. She said she missed me so much. She said she loved me. I ate that shit up. Honestly, I know she meant it. I know it. We started talking again, slipping into old habits. It was happy, but it felt like dating again? So I asked her what the hell was this. She said she didn\u2019t know, and that all she knew is that she knew I was the one for her, but being apart wasn\u2019t good for her mental health. A shitty crossroads to be at. \n\nEventually, I laid out some boundaries. We agreed, it was stupid to be \u201cjust friends\u201d it wouldn\u2019t work. We decided that we should be close. Still talking, helping each other, but being respectful if one of us somehow got into another relationship. Long story short, the summer was a weird mix of being as I like to put it \u201cvery in love friends\u201d. We cared for each other, talked about funny stuff, sent memes, but also flirted outrageously. Sometimes she would text me serious serious love stuff and I knew it was genuine. I would to the same.\n\nThere was definitely some major speed bumps. We of course talked less. Didn\u2019t text each other 24/7 or call once a day. I felt ignored a lil. I needed some adjustment. She became snarky at times, cold even. We worked that out but it hurt. \n\nThis culminated in her telling me that she hasn\u2019t seen me in almost a year and its making it hard to reconnect with me. I agree, phones and FaceTime will never have that personal touch.\n\nI was so hesitant. I did NOT want to spend money to see her just to have her getting her back blown out my some dude as soon as she got to university. I want to note, thats not who she is and I know that, she\u2019s told me why, it was an irrational fear. At the root of it, I don\u2019t want to feel used. I don\u2019t want to spend this money, and feel like a fool. \n\nOn the other hand, to maintain the relationship, maintain the promise, I do need to see her. I want to. I bought the ticket. I am going in October.\n\nHeres why: about a week ago, her roomate called me. She told me that my ex was so sad she couldn\u2019t see me, and that she clearly was still into me, and that she was turning down every guy just because \u201cits not the same\u201d, so her roomate said, look, this is a unique situation, but anyone can see y\u2019all have something special. Don\u2019t lose that, please come see her.\n\n(she cannot come see me because her parents are really really really really bad people. they would annihilate her if they found out, and wouldn\u2019t support it)\n\nJudge me how you will. She is the one for me, and I wont stop loving her until she tells me its over. Theres more, my best friends from HS also go to her university, its a one stop shop for love, affection, bro time, partying, and just happiness. \n\nYou may be now going, \u201cokay, that sounds good! why are you lonely?\u201d\n\nI am back home right now with my parents. I took a semester off. I need time to reset, deal with my depression, deal with my anxiety, earn money to pay for school, and an apartment. However, I have no friends in this city, I work 55 hour weeks, I feel dead. \n\nI see all my friends going back to school, having fun, reconnecting, chilling together. \n\nAnd i\u2019m here alone. Far away. I don\u2019t feel real to them. I feel like a machine. Work, eat, sleep, repeat. I\u2019m 20, I should be in my prime, yet I feel so low. \n\nI am going to go see her. I want to know, and see for myself if the love is still there. If its real, I will continue to put effort in. If it\u2019s fake, I will have to move on, a big challenge. Wish me luck my friends.\n\n\nThis was a lot to type, if you are still here, I fucking salute you. This may seem like nothing, but to me its impacted me a lot and changed my life for better and worse. I will keep you all updated as to what happens.\n\nSo yeah, thats why I have the phrase \u201cLove knows no distance\u201d. It is so damn true. We love each other. However, distance can impact and warp the love we have, and make love something too intense to bear. \n\nThank you for reading, this has helped me so much. Now people know what I am going through. I don\u2019t care if this is \u201ctoo long for reddit\u201d, or a \u201cstupid read\u201d. I feel better. Thank you.", "subreddit": "lonely"}

I am 20 and I have never been involved with anyone. Never really had friends except for a person here and there in grade school. No one has ever liked me. I grew up hating myself. At first, I was physically disabled and then I realized I was gay. Religion is huge in my family and I feel so terrible knowing that after God has \u201cblessed\u201d me with life, I am secretly what he hates. I\u2019m not religious anymore but I still feel bad all the times my family members talk about the suffering people like me will end up facing. I can\u2019t remember a time where I was content with myself. I do believe that I am not worth existing most times but I try to keep myself thinking about other things to not think about the that. I was raised in a house where human touch and physical affection weren\u2019t a thing past the age of 5. My family just doesn\u2019t do those things and I\u2019m fine with that. However, unlike some of my other siblings, I have never experienced warmth from another human before. No date, never went to prom, etc. I am currently closeted and have too much anxiety to ever go on an app &amp; meet some random old guy at his house at 2 AM. I would rather want a relationship but at this point, I\u2019m considering just letting anybody use me to feel anything. I know this all sounds very pathetic but I am truly devoid of human touch or interaction really. I only have one distant straight friend but ever since I came out to him, it\u2019s been weird. He kept on questioning me about it like every person who ever met me but I am so deep in my numbness that I just said yes.  Now, I feel like the gross one he wants to ask gay questions about. But, I like him and he\u2019s the only person who ever interacts with me so It\u2019s OK for now. I don\u2019t know if other gays feel this way but I hate seeing straight couples because it reminds me how sick I am. It\u2019s so easy for them to be normal and not have their family be against them because of their perverted attractions. Seeing gay couples make me feel terrible but that\u2019s mostly me feeing jealous of their openness. I am so anxious about my future and my eventual abandonment of my family one day. That friend always asks me what I will do when my family finds out and sometimes I just want to scream. Why was born this way? Is there any gay people on this subreddit here who feel this way? If so, please feel free to talk. I feel so alone in this. I don\u2019t know any gay person. I am in a bad place right now and just need someone to care.

I had great friends, a nice house, the typical American pre-teen life. Until, my mom thought it was a good idea to move to England. I didn\u2019t think she was being serious so I just put it aside. What I didn\u2019t know, was that we were having huge financial struggles. And I just didn\u2019t understand how, and I still don\u2019t. How can all those other people in America live with such big debt and financial issues yet I had to move. Why me? After 7th grade, my family moved to Nashville Tennessee. I was lonely at first yeah but being so close to home, I adapted quickly and made such great friends that I love, and hold close to my heart. I was only there for a year, and this time it really hurt. I would cry myself to sleep every night, and I stopped eating and I had no motivation to get out of bed. After summer ended for everyone, and seeing everyone go back to school in high school as freshmen while I stayed home, alone, packing, watching my friends stories on social media seeing them all together laughing. I felt so empty. I felt nothing at that point. Then I finally moved to England, the UK. I moved here about a month ago, and I\u2019m so sad. It\u2019s gotten to the point where I can\u2019t even cry anymore. Everytime I\u2019m sad I\u2019m just empty inside. Like I left a piece of mind in every place I used to live in. Now I live in a one floor, one bathroom apartment. I\u2019m only 14, and I don\u2019t fit in at school at all. Everyone just sees me as the american kid. No one wants to know me.

It\u2019s ironic to think that being connected with everything online can make you feel so disconnected. I\u2019m 21F. My life is consumed with social media. I hate it. I live at home for college and my Instagram is just a feed of people showing off how much fun they\u2019re having. At first it made me sad when I would compare my commuter life to all my \u201cfriends\u201d from high school who moved on to live this wild &amp; exciting life. Now I\u2019ve decided that I actually don\u2019t care anymore because it\u2019s fucking fake. \n\nI remember when I was younger we took pictures for memories. Now we take pictures to tell stories. We share pictures to show that our lives are great and we\u2019re having fun. The motivation behind posting an Instagram is just for the satisfaction of having someone pressing \u201clike\u201d. The more likes you get, the better you feel. I\u2019m over it. I talk to, in real life, about 3% of my followers (1,200 followers). If I wanna show them something can\u2019t I just show them in person when I see them? Why do I need to post it on social media for 1,000 people to see?\n\nTwo weeks ago I deactivated my Instagram and it\u2019s been the best decision I\u2019ve made in a while. It doesn\u2019t cure my loneliness completely but it makes me feel more comfortable with it. I like having nothing to compare my life to. Which is a great feeling. The only thing I have to compare myself to is my friends and family who I love. They are the only people I give a shit about. I don\u2019t feel bad anymore about the fact that my life consists of working 30 hours a week, going to school, working my ass off at the gym, and sometimes going out drinking with my friends. That is what makes me happy and I don\u2019t need strangers on Instagram to make me feel like my life is less exciting or cool than theirs. \n\nRight now the world loves to share and show off every aspect of their life. One day people will slowly start to go offline to realize the satisfaction that comes for keeping large parts of your life private.

Not a single person at my school that I've been at for over a year knows my name; I spend days alone in my dorm playing games or browsing the net because I can't stand the abyss of loneliness inside me and knowing that nobody in the world wants to talk to me or spend time with me.

My mom is abusive, my dad is emotionally absent and my brother is six and not someone I could have a relationship as an equal.\n\nI feel like I truly embody the definition of being completely alone. I have been alone for a long time; it essentially defines me as a person. I'm completely on my own, and when you're completely alone your mind does terrible things to fuck with you to cope.

And in turn every time I've ever been cold to a guy he has ended up *chasing* me.\n\nI had a friend in high school who was really in love with me. He would follow me around. He would hold things for me or do whatever I asked. He would follow me and tell me jokes in the halls trying to get me to laugh. I liked him back but I was too shy/inexperienced to act on it. I was telling a guy friend the other night about this guy and he said if I had ever admitted to him how I felt he would of probably lost interest because *men want what they can't have*. If I had made myself available to him he would of lost interest.\n\nIt just reminded me of how in so many of my break ups within serious long term relationships I was told I was 'too nice' and that being some kind of reason that something was *missing* for him. I guess the thing missing is the thrill of the chase(?)\n\nBut **I don't WANT** to be cold, bitchy, or mean in order to generate interest.

By the time I had accepted the request, she had gone offline.\n\nThe next day I woke up and saw that she had messaged me. I sent her a message back and we started talking. This was on wednesday morning. That same morning I logged on to Reddit to see a PM from someone I've never seen before. They said they had seen my post and wanted to help me with the girl. I will call them January, because I love Prey and they contacted me in much the same manner. I did not know them and out of they blue, they came to me bearing help. January threw a bunch of personal info at me without me asking to prove that they are for real. So, I accepted.\n\nI talked with the girl a few more times and reported back to January for any directions on what I should do. From then on, I pretty much consulted everything I did with them. Funnily enough, January's advice wasn't of the \"jUsT bE cOnFiDeNt, BrO\" type, they really gave me practical and specific guidance on how to behave with her and it was really helpful.\n\nOn Thursday or Friday, I had almost three hours to kill on campus, so I asked the girl if she is there too and wants to hang out. She said she is at her halls and can't do that. Okay, fair enough, I believed she was honest.\n\nOn Sunday, I was going with the uni's motorsport society to watch a screening of the Singapore GP. I imagined the girl would probably not be interested, but I was going anyway, and who knows, maybe she would have wanted to go. So I asked her. And she said she is not interested in motorsport at all, but she will go with me. January said that this is great and I thought they were right. She suggested to meet up outside my hall and we would go to the bar.\n\nI was so very nervous, but we did meet up. I fucking enjoyed myself a lot and I think she did enjoy talking to me as well, at least when we were walking to and from the place. She did seem kind of bored when we were watching, and I don't blame her for that. After around 40 minutes, she said she wants to leave, because she's got some studying to do. Fair enough, I walk her back to her hall (and again, she really seemed to like talking to me during that) and then I go back to watch the rest. Don't know if she left early because she was bored, or if she really did plan do to that earlier.\n\nReported to January. They said the situation seemed good.\n\nThe next day I message her saying that I really enjoyed myself and that we should meet up again, this time in a situation that she would actually enjoy and I suggested some times. And there it came. She said she has no time this week and she doesn't know what her schedule will be like and that she would message me if she found some time. She soft-ghosted me.\n\nWhat do I want to do now? I don't know. Before I had met her, I thought I had completely given up and lost hope of finding any friends. But now, I was kind of appetized by that encounter. I don't want to say I will try some more, because the curse of FA is still bearing on me. But maybe I could? I don't know. Probably will end up doing nothing as always.\n\ntl;dr: Ended like it always does. Fizzles out before anything ends up happening.\n\nJanuary, if you're reading this, thanks for all the help. I don't know why you're wasting your time on the sorry fuck that I am.\n\nI don't know what to do. I still hate myself and I'm still alone. I think re-accepting my FAness is the least bad I can do. Now, I'm just laying around wasting time, because I don't really want to do anything.", "subreddit": "ForeverAlone"}

I could be very popular one year then not at all. And by not at all, I mean, eating lunch alone without a friend in the world. I am always wondering what changed about me? Did I do something? \n\nYear's later.. I'm now 31. \n\nI arrived late on the first day of the third semester (of my college program). I am by myself in the back row. There is one other girl in the back row. One final girl enters the classroom, she will have to sit next to me or the other girl. No surprise, she sits next to the other girl. Ever since that day, everyone keeps the same seating and I am alone. What is it about me that people just shy away from?\n\nI tried to be happy and engaging when everyone was just starting to meet each other. I seemed to get along fine. Then as the days went on, people began to establish their friendships and nobody continued talking to me. \n\nI try to occasionally strike up a conversation, but they seem eager to be done. When people DO talk to me, I feel like I'm overly enthused and desperate. I try to play it down. Now am I pushing people away? \n\nI try to be happy and confident. I raise my hand in class, laugh, and smile with the teachers jokes. I have a learning disability, my confidence is waning. Nobody can see me smile, I'm in the back row.. \n\nI share too much information about myself. I told the class that I have dyscalculia when it was mentioned in the lesson. Why did I do that? Do I really need attention so badly that I will highlight my faults for everyone? \n\nMaybe people don't like me because I'm an idiot? I have learning disabilities, maybe I come off as a tard? \n\nMaybe I project too much confidence that it irritates people. I should have more self-awareness and be ashamed. I should sit in silence. \n\nMaybe I'm unlikeable? Awkward, un-enjoyable, annoying etc. \n\nWhen I made friends in the past (however fleeting), it seemed effortless. I envy those who just naturally connect with others. I feel like a broken human.\n\nAlthough my examples are all school-related, this is indicative of every part of my life.\n\nI can NOT make friends. After revealing that I have dyscalculia for no apparent reason today, I now vow to never speak up in class or raise my hand again. I am humiliating and want to disappear in the back of the room.\n\nHello social deprivation.\n\n*UPDATE: Today I mustered the courage and sat in a different spot. I wedged myself into the second row instead of the isolated back row. \n\nMy day went 100% better. Everyone was talkative with me and I laughed through most of the class and the intense feeling of crippeling loneliness and self-consciousness vanished. \n\nFor me, I needed to get out of my head, stop over-analyzing. It was really as easy as just moving to a different seat. I didn't hit it off with the girls in the back row, but I did with the girls in my new spot. \n\nMy experience is obviously unique to me and my social issues aren't magically cured by moving seats.

I haven't read it yet but even just reading the reviews made me feel completely hopeless and dejected. Sadly, it seems like a lot of what the book is talking about seems correct though. That's the worse part. The book is called *Why Men Love Bitches* by Sherry Argov.\n\nAny time I'm with a guy and I am my 'true' self than I'm labeled as clingy or a doormat. However if I pretend to be uninterested, cold, and cruel than I actually get pursued! It's a horrible feeling. Pretending to be the type of person that I fundamentally am not just to generate interest.\n\nIt's like some kind of ego thing. The other person likes the thrill of the chase but someone easy &amp; loving it's boring to them.\n\nI've only ever gone for stereotypical Nice Guys^(tm). I have CPTSD from CSA (Complex Post Traumatic Stress Disorder from Childhood Sexual Assault; basically I was molested as a child). So for that reason really outgoing guys scare me. Particularly sexually. For example if I can't control when initiation occurs sexually I feel panicked &amp; scared. Aggressive, angry, masculine men scare me obviously; but even if he's a chill guy but still initiates too fast it might scare me and cause flashbacks. So I've always gone for shy, meek, 'beta' (I hate that word) men. **And yet these are the guys who ended up hurting me still!** I've been told by these types that I'm \"**too nice**\" many times. It's usually happened in long term relationships lasting over a year. But even in short term more sexual flings, lasting a month or two. The submissives that I found in BDSM spaces while playing as a domme, almost every one has told me I'm \"**not hard enough**\". Which has ended up really bothering me and damaging my ego, and turning me into a genuinely more angry person (just not in a sexy way) because I *still* felt pressured to perform a certain &amp; specific way. A way that doesn't align with who I am. Even when I'm advertising myself as clearly as possible as a person who requires control &amp; to lead the relationship. I *still* somehow am not leading in a \"**hard**\" or dominant enough way to them! So even in BDSM relationships where I'm domme I *still* feel like I'm being pressured and manipulated into doing something sexually that I don't want to. It feels so hopeless because even while outright saying that I need to have sexual control the pressure to perform in a certain way is *still* there. And I just continuously fail to perform correctly.\n\nAbout 6 months ago I read this post on reddit. I didn't save it. I think it was on r/sex. It was about a guy who's girlfriend had asked him to do consensual non consent play. He said in the middle of preforming the scene he had a panic attack and ran to the bathroom and threw up. He said his girlfriend had called him a pussy and left and hadn't talked to him since. Even though it was a guys experience I related to it so deeply. Especially that confusion at the very end of his story. When she leaves him.\n\nI've felt like people have tried to make me feel my whole life that I'm supposed to feel broken, damaged, and an outsider for what has happened to me and **yet** everywhere I look what's considered 'normal' is just basic cruelty. Why is being evil not seen as broken??? It's treated as if it's just a part of life too. People act as if cruelty is fundamental and needed for survival. The normalization of all these power dynamics is the most disheartening part of the entire dating scene.\n\nI'm just tired of pretending to ***not*** want a relationship just to give the superficial appearance that I have a socially acceptable level of stoicism, coldness, and cruelty to warrant other's believing I'm dominant *enough* to be 'rewarded' with one.", "subreddit": "ForeverAlone"}

When i was walking by her I immediately thought to say hi and complement her cool hairstyle. Then when the moment passed I thought \"eh she's probably taken and I'm gonna look dumb..\" And \"shes out of my league\". We ended up just continued  smiling at each other and walking our separate way. Immediate regret. I hate that i need absolute certainty to make a move (aka Why ive sadly stuck to online dating as of the past couple years). Why am I like this..", "subreddit": "lonely"}

Apparently some type of shit went down and she needs someone to drive her. My other coworker was unavailable apparently. She sent me a Snapchat of herself crying, which i thought was kinda dumb, but a girl's in need and I have the chance to be her knight in shining armor.\n \nToday, i go down and pick her up. I tell a few jokes to lighten up the mood and she laughs, I seemed to cheer her up well enough. So i asked her what happened, and she vents to me the whole drive there. When we get to our destination, I get out, walk over to her, and wrap my arms around her in a loving embrace. The wind picks up, and the cherry blossoms swirl around us, riding on the breeze. She begins to cry into my chest. I tell her, \"I dont know if theres anything i can say to help the situation or cheer you up, but just know that I'm always here to lend an ear and stand by your side.\" When she was ready to go in, I grabbed her by the hand and we walked in together. \n \nExcept thats not at all how it went. What actually happened was that i told a few jokes in the car that fell flat, then i meekly asked her to tell me what happened yesterday. She does vent to me, but i couldnt tell you what she was upset about because I was too busy trying to calm my beating heart, which was going crazy due to the fact that an actual human female was in the car with me. So i nearly crash twice on the drive there, the latter half of which was silent because trying to have a conversation with a crush and drive at the same time is apparently a Herculean labor. We get to our destination and my brain can finally devote more of its resources to the conversation at hand. Its going into overdrive trying to generate an appropriate dialogue choice in the few seconds that its taking me to park. And after all that, the phrase that it comes up with is simply: \"That sucks.\"  \n \nSo we sit in silence for a few seconds (she doesnt get out immediately, I guess she was waiting on me to say something else) before I awkwardly shuffle out of the car. She gets out and we start out walking side by side, but my dumb ass can't figure out how to control my pace so i wind up walking in front of her. Then i mutter some shit about always being there to lend an ear, which didn't come across nearly as dramatic as I wanted it to. The only thing i did \"right\" was that I did open the door for her, so yay? \n \nShe's currently in the back being consoled by another female coworker, who is effortlessly accomplishing pretty much exactly what i fantasized about. \n \nI fucking hate myself", "subreddit": "ForeverAlone"}

This is just a bit about my life, what I\u2019ve gone through and what\u2019s led me to where I am now, I don\u2019t have anyone else to turn to so internet people it is).\n\nBack when I was in elementary school I was bullied constantly, I didn\u2019t let it get to me though and I told myself that one day I\u2019d make em\u2019 all sorry. By the time 9th grade rolled around I had about a dozen close friends and hundreds of acquaintances. I had ran away from my dads place to live with my mom since I craved freedom and I ditched my old friends for a bigger high school with the \u201cpopular kids\u201d, I went to all kinds of parties every weekend for about a year and a half. My life was like a movie, seriously it was insane... I had drug dealers in their 40s giving me 200$ and ounces of weed just to hangout with them, and everyday I was out and about on some kind of adventure, never really with the same people twice. \n\nClearly this was a bad path so it\u2019s not surprising that I dropped out of school and became a heavy alcoholic. I was dropping friends and weight like crazy, isolating myself in my bedroom with my best friends Raven and Elyssa, getting drunk and smoking pot and cigarettes. This went on for a few months until I met my now ex boyfriend, Damien. He was the persona of what my life had become, chaotic, violent and controlling. I lost the remaining friends I did have because either he made me quit talking to them or I\u2019d just gotten too drunk and started shit. Even Raven eventually quit coming around because I was such a raging alcoholic I had started punching her when I was blackout. All I had was Damien my controlling, abusive bf and my best friend Elyssa who for some reason Damien seemed to not mind. Elyssa eventually got into a relationship with a guy named Adam and we\u2019d hangout as a group of 4 (Me, Damien, Elyssa and Adam). A few months into summer, Elyssa and Adam broke up and things went downhill for her. She ended up killing herself mid august of 2017 and I ended up in the hospital due to how much weight I\u2019d lost. I haven\u2019t been close with a girl since she passed, but I am in a healthy relationship with a new boyfriend. \n\n\nI\u2019ve come so far, I\u2019m 18 now, I\u2019m finally at a stable weight, my eyebrows have grown back (don\u2019t ask) and I\u2019m ready to start my life. \nI just can\u2019t seem to do it. No body will hire me because I haven\u2019t finished school, I struggle with crippling depression &amp; anxiety, and I honestly wish I had a friend to talk to.\nI can\u2019t help but feel like I\u2019ve fucked up my entire life and I\u2019m never going to get out of this hole, the only work I can come across is cam shows and such... I\u2019m so broke, I don\u2019t even have my L yet. (I live in Canada)\nLife handed me so much to begin with, I had the friends and popularity I always wanted but I guess I couldn\u2019t handle it and I lost control.\nI don\u2019t know why I\u2019m posting this I\u2019m just desperate, maybe one of you has gone through something similar and has advice or just any advice and comments in general would be sincerely appreciated.\n-Lost Girl", "subreddit": "lonely"}

I don't regret it, but it led to me seeing some things i really did not want to see. I felt very lonely even before doing this, but things have changed a bit since.\n\nI need people. I always have and probably always will. I need to feel like i make a positive difference in someone's life to feel like i'm worth being alive. \n\nSince this break up, i have tried to get closer to my friends (the relationship didn't push me away from them in any way, but now i was trying harder), but it wasn't really working. Most of them either had something better to do than doing whatever with me or just wanted to avoid any intimacy for some reason. Even if i just wanted to talk about something (very usually personal problems that come from not being a very mentally healthy person), they would try to change the subject to basically impersonal small talk or just stop talking. I know, it is my fault for keep bringing up these not very fun topics, but in my defense it really didn't look like they would act any differently if it was another subject.\n\nAt first this was annoying, but after a 4 weeks vacation in which i spent most of it locked in my room due to not having anyone to do anything with, this started to become increasingly difficult to bear.\n\nAfter my classes started, i thought they would help distracting me of this. And they did, for a while, but soon enough i found that my college friends also had the same disinterest in me in every way. Still, i talked to people at least 4 days a week, even if it was mostly random small talk.\n\nI was trying to help anyone with whatever they needed that wasn't too extravagant or out of reach for me. From assignements to just being an ear to whoever needed and stuff like that. I thought i could try to transform my suffering into kindness, and maybe helping others would help me too. It is a nice thought, and i hold to it even now, but in the end no one wanted my help. Maybe it was me who was so hung up to my own loneliness that i couldn't feel the empathy needed for this. Still, most of the time it felt like i was just intruding on other people's life.\n\nSometimes, when i was alone in my room late at night, the loneliness would creep in and send me in a spiral of dread that would knock me down to my bed and make me question why the hell am i still alive. Whenever that happened, i would try to reach out to one of my friends, but they would always act in the same disconnected way. Still, it was better than nothing. \n\nThat went on for a couple of months, until every single one of them was fed up with me. The last time i tried my hand at this pathetic endeavor, i was so far down the pit i tried using some self destructive behavior to get attention. 2 of them reminded me, pretty bluntly, that this is my problem and not theirs, and that they had better things to do and their own shit to put up with. That broke me. They were completely right on this, of course, and i really should stop doing it.\nPretty fun how my loneliness is making me push away the people i like.\n\nSo i did stop, i have been trying for the last few weeks to not seek help from them when i'm feeling like a useless lazy bastard that everyone only puts up with because telling me to fuck off would much more trouble than i'm worth.\n\nWhich is what brings me here. Because of some random event, i don't have classes this week, which led me to being now on my second day on which i don't leave my room except to get food and go the bathroom. It is expected that this will continue for the next 4 days, but i'm not sure how i'm going to handle it. There is no one left i could reach out to. I tried pretending i was ok to ask someone one out, but i was promptly ignored (maybe it is because it is the middle of the week, i hope).\n\nYesterday i tried drinking it away, but luckily i hate the taste of alcohol and ended up not drinking too much. Today the suicidal fantasies came back, and i'm not sure how long it will take for me to go back to my self harm habits. \nAnd i'm running out of shit to try to fill the void. Every anime or game i am either close to finishing it or am feeling less and less enthusiastic about. My self image is slowly shattering, in a way that makes leaving my room increasingly difficult: no one wants me, so i'm a burden to everyone and shouldn't bother them with my presence.\n\nI have no expectation of finding new people to hang out with, i usually need the pretense of doing something to be confortable enough to try to get close to someone, but i'm stuck only in college(with loads of people that don't care), with nothing i really  want to engage in outside of it. Even if i did, for the reasons above it would be very hard.\n\nIn the end, i feel like this room i use to run from reality has become a prison i can not escape, and the walls are slowly closing in while i repeat myself to sleep \"i will die alone and no one will even notice\".\n\nThanks for reading, it really means a lot to me. Just the fact i'm letting this out makes me feel a lot better.", "subreddit": "lonely"}

That is kind of the best way I can describe it. It is usually just a passing thought, and I don't think that much of it later. I haven't had any friends (at least true friends) in years. I just don't really feel fully accepted by anyone. Even a chick who was friendly to me at first started to seem uninterested with me shortly after. So I think that kind of says something about my social life.\n\nI am just wondering if this is because I have no emotional connection with anyone at college, or if I am really that desperate for a relationship. Like, I might finally be starting to see signs of the biological want for someone, anyone, to socialize with, and I am unconsiously approaching it in an extreme way. Is that a thing? Just being so lonely you are pretty much willing to be in a relationship with anyone who is not repulsed by you? Or do I just get attached way too easily and then forget about it soon after? Is it weird that a gay chick is even willing to be with a man in this kind of situation? I genuinely don't know at this point.", "subreddit": "lonely"}

I am an absolute loser when it comes to the opposite sex, there was a girl I work with in my detachment that I have a huge crush on. I try hard to act normal and confident and try strike up conversations with her and I felt it was going good. I really felt good about myself being able to be \"normal\". I realised how much of a beta I really  when my \"friend\" starts talking with her and they instantly seem soooo friendly with eachother and she laughs at everything he says and so on. I realise she is infinitely more friendly with literally everyone else, honestly i felt jealous that I never get to see this side of her and it actually made me cry later on. I get I'm not entitled to anyone's friendship but goddamn did it hurt, it was also a stark reality check. \n\nI realise later she thinks I'm a fucking joke and so does everyone. I'm just that one guy that they talk to cause I'm just there. They all party together get along alot better without me. I had just been an absolute naive idiot the whole time and feel like such a tool. I'm really not sure where im going with this. I just dont have other places to get this off my chest. I wish I was born again and got a re roll on everything. \n\nMaybe I'm overreacting but even my future dreams seem so pointless if I carry on like I am, the pathetic little brown kid. I just wish I had people irl i could really talk too. I've thought of ways I could just dip outta life but I really don't have the guts and they all seem too hard. It really seems like im overreacting ik but if the rest of my younger years the ones your meant to really enjoy carry on like this, then I dont wanna do it.\n\nI haven't had nearly the level of experiences people my ages usually have and it really fucking hurts to think about how pathetic that is. I hate being the small ugly brown kid, whos eyes aren't the same size, whose nose is fucking huge. That fucking pathetic loser who cant talk to any girls and is the joke expandable to everyone else. Called a fucking incel, even homosexual (Not homophobic but im not and its used wrongly so as an insult cause im not successful with the opposite sex).  I have never even held hands with a girl full stop. Its actually so pathetic I dont know how you guys do it for so much longer than me. I just feel so emasculated.\n\nPeople dont like it but being brown and a man is just undesirable especially when you're ugly. Its inherently seen as creepy and predatory. Especially when your ugly. I fucking hate my self and hate the fact I'm both brown and ugly. I tried to change things prove myself and still want to but im really loosing fucking motivation here. \n\nAgain really sorry for this shitshow that makes no sense but I gotta get it off my chest. I guess all this can make me a bitter person at times but I really can't help it.", "subreddit": "ForeverAlone"}

Even though I do like memes, I feel like I'm too different still. Like when I download videogames for myself, I end up quitting them after a while. When I decide to watch a TV show, I forget about it for a while. I decided to watch anime last year because it was mainstream, but I lost interest. I decided to listen to one of Blackpink's albums on Spotify but stopped after a while. I'll probably do it all soon, but I feel like I have no purpose to do it. At the same time though, I don't feel depressed, but I do feel like my existence is pointless other than to get a job in the future and excel at school, which is good but makes everything else in life pointless. BTW, the reason why I say I'm incapable of mainstream interests is because while everyone else cares for TV, music, videogames, etc., I care for trains and animals. Since my school is located in a transit desert (which means there are no trains in the area), nobody is into trains (even though there are trains in the neighborhood where I live). As for animals, people like them, but I feel like it's not too much of a conversational topic. Also everyone at my school is in their own little cliques, so I don't want to intrude cause I know they're already well-established and they're all mainstream. Also, this is kind of related to trains, but not to the topic, but I'll say it anyways: Last year, when I was 14-15 years old (I'm now almost 17), I was harrassed by my dad because I was watching Thomas the Tank Engine (the really early seasons though, not the Teletubbies-simple 2000's episodes I grew up with). If you like the 2000's episodes, I respect your opinion, I just wanted to specify that the 80's and 90's episodes are more for a general audience like Spongebob or Gumball as opposed to the 2000's and 2010's episodes when it was more tailored for a younger audience a la Baby Looney Tunes. However my family doesn't know that it was more of a general audience show, so my dad was treating me like a baby and went into my YouTube account for some unknown reason (probably to annoy me\ud83d\ude21) and found it was 100% Thomas videos (again, the old seasons, not the Modern Series of the 2000's as they call it). I had to stop watching it because I didn't want to be treated like a 4-year old by my dad, and I knew that they think of Thomas as a simplistic, babyish show like Peppa Pig, even though it's much deeper than it looks.

I was rejected in grade school when the girl I liked found out about my crush on her and pretty much screamed at me on the playground.

The last one was 8th grade, wherein I asked a girl out, my classmates (either as a joke or out of pity) pressured her into going out with me, then she spent all of that time running away from me, rejecting my gifts (or sharing them with her classmates), rejecting my poems, and telling another guy she'd go out with him after me. Strange how that shit from the early years stick with you, huh? By the time I'd graduated high school, I was more outgoing, loud, and way less shy, but I was still a weirdo.\n\nGraduated (I was smart, just barely put in the effort), turned down college (had no clue why I'd get myself into debt when I had no clue what I wanted to do), had a couple of long distance relationships (I left them, surprisingly), spiraled into depression, got myself therapy, a stable job, learnt to cook and do laundry in almost no time, rented a room in an apartment, then got myself transferred out of state and landed an actual apartment.\n\nStill I just don't have the self-esteem or trust to just ask a girl out. I'll flirt, converse, joke with, and even make smart remarks towards one, but taking that last step becomes a canyon leap, rather than an actual step.

I can not get  around freely. This on top of the fact, I do not go to  school/college/university of any kind. My school days ended after high  school, and since then I've made a dream of having art be my one job  real, which means I work from home. Plus, my city is not a place were  you can just walk to where ever you want to go, it's too big and hot as  shit out.\n\nIn the post I said, \"I'm  in place in my life where I can only see girls in pubic, at most, twice  a year for up to a week's worth of time overall.\"\n\nSo  what I was referring to here was going to local or out of town anime  conventions. And I would arrive to these with one of my friends, who I  hang out with here and there. I don't have any contact info with any of  the girls I used to like, because we were never that close.\n\nI  figured if me and a girl weren't hanging out, it was because she didn't  want to and there would be no point in getting their number or  whatever. Most of the girls I knew were only friends with my buds, these  girls could care less if I was around or not. I would only see them in a  group setting, and I would always be a fly on the wall because they  just felt cold and distant. I would talk, make jokes, and directly  engage with them as a friend, but they didn't give a shit overall. So if  that's the case, why fucking bother with them moving forward.\n\nI  still had a few girls that I did feel like I was close to, the ones who  would click with me, laugh with me, and see me as I saw them. The  coolest girls in the world in my book, fucking love each and every one  of them. But classes changed, I saw less and less of them for years on  end, and I felt like they had mostly moved on as we were nearing the end  of high school.\n\nHigh school was  my last real chance to grow, but I didn't know how life for me would get  afterwards. I didn't realize it was my last chance. But anyways, that's  just an explanation for why I have no one to go to, and no one to help  me.\n\nI don't want to use my  friend's ride as a way to meet girls, because that's not his problem, and he's usually insanely busy everyday. Same with my other friends.\n\nI  would do my very fucking best to make real connections this time! I've  been through a lot of hell to get to where I am, and every wound left a  lesson I'm ready to atone for. But I'm plain and simple fucking stuck  wondering around in the house. Now I'm left with nothing but memories of  regret.\n\nI have a whole world to  offer, but it's just ready for the fucking scrapheap, a waste. I've  always struggled with sharing and I'm ready to be better than this,  doesn't even fucking matter now. It's an outwards manifestation of being  imprisoned in my own self indulgence.

You believe that it's a magical spell that will make any girl like you, until you try it. Being yourself doesn't mean doing what you do at home or whatever. It means being openly passionate about your interests and hobbies and your personality. If you're really into anime, go to a convention, find a local club. Where the shirts you want to wear, don't be afraid to show your interests.\n\nThen you may say \"I've tried that and so many girls turned me down.\" Why would you want to be with those girls if they don't like you for who you are anyways? You're not looking to just find a girl on the spot because you're \"being yourself\". You're looking for that one girl who you'll truly feel in sync with. And if you get a bland girl, you'll still feel alone. You could look like Tom Hiddleston and if you don't have any interests or things to show off, girls won't care how good you look. And it may take a while, but you have to realize at the same time that you're letting women control your emotions by loathing yourself in self-pity and loneliness. You're letting them control your life.\n\nAnd you should always try to better yourself mentally and physically. Better your morals and principles, better yourself physically. Not for women, but to feel proud of yourself. To know that you're constantly improving. To know that your life will stand out from others in the end. Even if you start to develop your interests for the purpose of getting a girl, you'll realize the journey there gave you new life long friends and happiness.\n\nStop focusing on getting a woman as your only goal, develop your interests. You'll regret it later in life if you don't. Time is going to pass anyways.

A few months after I bought my own car and I try to visit them from time to time. Recently, I\u2019ve been visiting less and less. I usually go there when there\u2019s a new movie we wanna watch cause I love going to the movies with them on the same day the movie gets out. Now, it\u2019s been months since I\u2019ve seen them and Joker\u2019s around the corner and I made plans to go watch it and then remembered I have an appointment that weekend. I don\u2019t know what to do. I work now which is a big change. I\u2019m a teacher and it\u2019s killing me lately I haven\u2019t socialized with my own adult friends in so long and I get really envious of them. They go out. They drink and dance, they hook up while I\u2019m just living back home and dealing with a bunch of kids day in and day out. I COULD miss work on Friday so I could catch the movie with them have a bit of fun and still make it to my important appointment. I have missed work before to do that (Avengers Endgame). And I did have my birthday this month and spent it teaching and crying in my car. Lots of excuses to go, I know right? Just excuses. But also, I have my excuses to stay. Cause socializing gives me anxiety. Seeing them after so long, trying to talk to them and staying at their place. Hearing about this night out of the other one sometimes makes me feel like complete shit. Like I\u2019m not cool enough (because I\u2019m not (22 year old teacher living at my parents). Idk. I probably need to meet new people, I wish I could but it still gives me anxiety. I feel like no matter the decision I take I\u2019ll still regret doing it.", "subreddit": "lonely"}

I suppose one could argue that I should just think of an interest of mine and search the community related to that interest, however what if you wanted to find people with **many** common interests in not too much time (I lack patience :( )? I have not put enough thought into this, but I'd like to hear what others think. It'd be cool for example to just type say, 6 interests and have a list of people appear who also have those interests.

And I think I just recently came to the realization that I am in love with her, and have been since the first moment I laid eyes on her. We've known each other for going on 15 wish years now ? something like that. No, maybe 18 years. yea has to be that.   \n\n\nI first saw her sitting on the bus, way back in 2001. She was walking home, and I was taking the bus. I remember hearing the other kids argue which celebrity was hotter at the time, and I just turned my head and saw her walking past the bus. What a sight. Ill never forget that moment, because that was the moment I saw the most beautiful woman on the planet.   \n\n\nSo, we accadently became friends a few months later when I started hanging around a few of her other friends, and we became pretty close from then on. You see, I was not a popular guy in school, actually pretty low on the totem pole if you get what I mean. She, plus her friends that I hung around were the only ones who actually treated me like a human being and tolerated me. I'm not sure if that is what strengthens my feelings for her, or what but man It felt good to be treated like a person. You see, at the time of school I was also trying to date one her her close friends(Lets call her Jessi), and she actually had strong feelings for me as well. (separate story but we never ended up together for some reason). I really did have strong feelings for Jessi, but I think I just now realized I first started to pursue her just to get close to Heidi. I never asked either one of them out, because both of them were the type of girls that always had boyfriends. And deep down inside, I always never ever ever ever actually tried to brake people up. I always respected boundaries. Even if they yell at their boyfriend that she wanted to sit next to me at the prom dinner over him, in front of us all. (Yea, im pretty pathetic)  \n\n\nSo the best part, was that she continued that far after high school. Were not as close anymore, real life gets in the way, friendships drift apart all that Jazz but we still talk from time to time on Facebook. I turned into a trucker, she served a tour in the Army (Yea, that is damn attractive in my books) and unfortunately for me, she still always had boyfriends with her. And two husbands. She now has a few kids, and is currently dating the father of her son.   \n\n\nI was there for her during her abusive husband, and I was there for her for her other events in life she needed a shoulder for. Ive always been there for her.   \n\n\nYou see, I do not want to interfere with her current relationship. She seems to be in a good spot. I missed my opportunity when her abusive husband left her to tell her how I feel, but I figured it was too soon and she needed time to heal. Well swoop in Mr. ImFixed, her first child's father who had figured out his issues and gotten back with her. Whatever, it sucks for me but good for her and good for the kid. So far he seems decent. Again, whatever it is what it is.   \n\n\nSo she keeps telling me when I drive through her state she wants to meet up, since we haven't seen each other for years (Because RL on both of our parts kept screwing shit up) and almost begging me to stop to catch up. I want to buy her flowers but I do not know if I should. Chocolates? something? I want to tell her that I Love her, have been since that first day I saw her. But I know I probably shouldn't. Leave it be, her son is with his dad, and they are a family right now.  But damnit I think of her every day.   \n\n\nMe being FA does not hurt the fact that I cant get her out of my head lol.", "subreddit": "ForeverAlone"}

And yet, for some reason, I've always struggled making friends.\n\nI honestly don't know if I have some type of childhood trauma I've repressed, but whenever I try to talk with someone I get nervous and have to force myself to relax - and it's obvious (and on top of that I tend to speak fast, stutter, and mumble at times. It's embarrassing.)\n\nI'm in my senior year of college right now, and I've haven't made a single friend and let alone gotten into a relationship. I have acquaintances, but I don't have anyone I can go get lunch or chat with after class. And it particularly sucks because in one of my classes, my professor likes to drill into my head that \"friends you make in college will last you a lifetime\". \n\nThe only friend (that I made in high school, btw) that I had at uni moved and even then they used to ghost me at times once they got a partner.\n\nIt sucks. The last time I had some social interaction was last week; some classmates offered me a ride back to uni after an event, and even though it was a short drive and I was a bit awkward, we still had a good time. Once we got to campus though, I thanked them, got off the car, and sat alone in an empty campus waiting for my dad to pick me up, while everyone else was laughing and socializing while driving off to get some lunch. That 15-20 minute drive was basically euphoric for me.\n\nRelationship wise, I've never been in one. I'm not even sure if I've ever felt romantic attraction before. But I can't help but want one. The three friends I managed to make at high school are all in relationships. Old acquaintances from elementary school are in relationships, some of them are even married. And constantly getting asked when I'm going to get a boyfriend is getting really, really tiring. I want someone I can trust, talk to, travel with, listen to, spend time with. But honestly at this rate, I don't think that's ever gonna happen.\n\nMy niche interests aren't helping me, either.

For most part of the first year it was going good. We ate together, played football, laughed our ass out on stupid jokes during lectures. As the days passed, those 2 got bored of attending in lectures and eventually started bunking lectures And later stopped coming to college. They used to come during exams and practicals and rarely during lectures. I couldn't afford to do such things as my parents worked their ass off to pay my fees and i always wanted to learn things, missing lectures was never my thing; which left me alone in college most of the days. Here comes the worst part: We used to have 2 long breaks for lunch and stuffs throughout the day . I have had a bad anxiety problem throughout years so i couldn't imagine having to lunch alone in canteen full of people. I somehow used to find some people from my class to go lunch with me. After the lunch, with so much time to expend I just couldn't figure out what to do. I was so lost days that i just used to take walks around the college campus alone just hoping none of those stupid college groups see me walking alone. It used to get even worse in 2nd break where for an hour i just used to sit alone in the class just tapping my phone just to seem busy. It seems easier to read this but that time it was so much troubling from inside, felt like something was piercing my skin. Those hour long breaks felt like eternity. When one or both of those friends used to come for lectures, they only sat for like 1 or 2 of them and many times i have inexplicably begged them to sit the lectures with me. Not even once they listened. Those were hard times and in final year i also started going to college fewer than usual. When most people now say they enjoyed their fullest in their college days only thing i can remember is how i loathe those times. \n\nThank you if you read this all.", "subreddit": "lonely"}

I like boy, but boy doesn't like me. \n\nThe last time I had a boyfriend is when I was fourteen. Im nineteen now. We broke up after a few months, and he eventually moved on to my sister, who would always comment about it, saying that now he likes her and implying that the only reason why he was ever with me was to get to her. Even one of my guy friends is starting to do that now. Since then, I've never had the same body image of myself. I'm never going to be pretty; no matter how much makeup I put on, how many times I straighten my hair, or post selfies on my instagram. I've been diagnosed with depression and anxiety and even though i'm a cis girl, i definitely feel a bit of body dysmorphia, if that's even possible. \n\nI thought going to college would mean that I could have a second chance. No one knew my past, or my mental issues that I struggle with, and most importantly, no one knew my sister. My first year was awful, I had only a handful interactions with guys. But this year I thought was going to be different. My roommates were friends with the guys in the apartment next to us. I was hopeful, I really was. \n\nOut of the four guys, one of them caught my eye. He was really tall, and we had a lot in common. We were both huge nerds and he is one of the sweetest guys i've ever met, and he even suggested that we should have a horror movie marathon night, but since none of our friends like horror, it would most likely be just us. I even told my mom about him, and now i'm realizing how dumb that was. \n\nBut, as time is going by, the more I come to terms with the fact that he would never like me like that. My roommates are so much prettier than I am, and he would most likely go for them instead. I never see him except for when i'm at his place with his roommates, and if some girl has him, i'm jealous of her. \n\nI've spent so much time wondering when the time will come, and who it will be.

I didn't give them much attention but ever since school started again I've noticed the pattern of go to school, make friend laugh, go home and either be sad and cry or make something funny. I wouldn't wanna blow my own horn, but I do have a good sense of humor. I constantly make people laugh without even putting that much effort into it. Thing is, I don't really have much more to offer to anyone. I'm not attractive, I'm not interesting, I can and want to be supportive and just a friend people would want to have for reasons other that humor, but noone sees past this funnyman that is in front of them. \\*He is for making you laugh, nothing else\\*\n\nEarlier this week me and a friend who I constantly goof off with were joking a lot about his ego and how invented music and sex. The next day I decided to put together a script of a parody interview with an exaggerated version of him. Nobody was avaliable or wanted to record with me so I did both roles by myself. I turned out so beautifully that I might even consider voice acting as a carrer path. Last evening I decided to make a sort of follow-up in the form of a news segment, again filled with inside jokes. I wrote a script, practiced acting it out once and then recoeded. It knew it wouldn't be as good as the first one and to br honest it was not bad at all. \n\nThe thing is that all throughout the process of creating that I couldn't get a certain thought out of my head - I want to be more than my sense of humor. I don't want to just be my friend group's entertainer. I don't want to be theirs. I want to be one of them.\n\nI don't really know why I made this post, you know how people on this sub are.

{"post_id": "dalg2j", "created_utc": 1569702727, "title": "How to Deal with Loneliness", "author": "Sbeast", "self_text": "**Introduction**\n\nLoneliness is the reaction to physical isolation, or perceived isolation and alienation in the presence of other people. It can cause a variety of unpleasant emotional responses, and can increase the risk of a number of health problems.\n\nResearch has shown that loneliness is prevalent throughout society, including people in marriages, relationships, families, veterans, and those with successful careers.\u00a0\n\nAccording to\u00a0a 2018 survey\u00a0from\u00a0*The Economist*\u00a0and the Kaiser Family Foundation (KFF), more than two in ten adults in the United States (22%) and the United Kingdom (23%) say they always or often feel lonely, lack companionship, or feel left out or isolated.  \n\n\n**Cause**\n\nLoneliness is generally caused by a lack of friendships, and relationships during childhood and adolescence, or a lack of physical presence of meaningful people. It can also be a symptom of certain problems such as chronic depression, or represent a dysfunction of communication with others. Loneliness is also studied as a social phenomenon that is capable of spreading like a disease throughout a population.  \n\n\n**Effects**\n\nLoneliness has a [wide range of negative effects](https://www.verywellmind.com/loneliness-causes-effects-and-treatments-2795749) on both physical and\u00a0mental health,\ufeff including:\n\n* Depression and\u00a0suicide\n* Cardiovascular disease and stroke\n* Increased stress levels\n* Decreased memory and learning\n* Antisocial behaviour\n* Poor decision-making\n* Alcoholism and drug abuse\n* The progression of Alzheimer's disease\n* Altered brain function\n\n  \n**Tips to reduce loneliness**\n\n**1) Prioritise intimacy** \\- A sense of loneliness doesn\u2019t just come from not being around people physically, but from a lack of true connection and intimacy.\n\n**2) Embrace authenticity** \\- Perhaps you feel lonely because you have become a stranger to yourself by denying your true authenticity. Risk being more real with yourself and to others.\n\n**3) Real conversations** \\- Talk more about things that are real, important, and meaningful to you, rather than shallow and generic small talk.\n\n**4) Choose friends carefully** \\- Minimise interactions with fake, shallow, or toxic people, and spend more time with supportive, loving, and real people.\n\n**5) Humbleness and modesty** \\- Sometimes our ego is what prevents us from truly connecting with others, so by embracing humbleness and modesty we can improve our connections to others.\n\n**6) Spirituality** \\- Pay attention to and grow your spiritual side, which can help to feel more connected to the world around us.\n\n**7) Altruism/Volunteering** \\- Contributing to the world through altruism or volunteering is a great way to meet others and feel like you are making a difference.\n\n**8) Embrace solitude** \\- Use time alone to work on yourself, appreciate peace and quiet, and practice self-care if required.\n\n**9) Hobbies** \\- It is always good to have a hobby or two, which can bring enjoyment and allow you to make new friends and connections.\n\n**10) Evening classes** \\- Considering taking up a course or evening class. You can meet like minded people whilst you expanding your repertoire of skills or knowledge.\n\n**11) Travelling** \\- Perhaps a change of location is what is needed. So take a vacation someone new or consider going travelling.\n\n**12) Common compassion** \\- Realise you are not alone in your loneliness, because it is currently an epidemic, and many other people are suffering too.\n\n**13) Optimism** \\- Embracing a more optimistic mindset and trying to see the positives more will open up the world to you more, than if you expect failure and rejection.\n\n**14) Learn something new** \\- Challenge yourself to learn something new, or study a different subject. Learning more about the world or history may help you to feel more connected to it.\n\n**15) Keep a journal** \\- Try to establish patterns of when you feel the most and least lonely. Is it certain people? Certain places? When you behave a certain way? Then set some goals to try to solve this problem.\n\n**16) Talk to someone or a helpline** \\- Try and find someone you can trust and talk to, if you don\u2019t feel you can trust anyone then give a helpline a call. By talking to someone you will be letting out how you feel which will make you feel a lot better.\n\n**17) Take it easy** \\- Being lonely can feel bad, and coping with it can be difficult. Don\u2019t expect to fully solve it straight away, rather, focus on coping with loneliness one step at a time.\n\n  \n**Quotes**\n\n&gt;\u201cRisk being seen in all your glory.\u201d \\~ Jim Carrey  \n\u201cTo find real peace you have to let the armour go. Your need for acceptance can make you invisible in this world.\u201d \\~ Jim Carrey  \n\u201cLoneliness expresses the pain of being alone and solitude expresses the glory of being alone.\u201d \\~ Paul Tillich  \n\u201cI used to think the worst thing in life is to end up all alone.

Also, they smoke far too much weed - as much as I\u2019m grateful\nFor them, I would give anything to have sober friends as I can\u2019t smoke and don\u2019t enjoy it anyway. \n\nI would love a happy relationship, a stable job with good coworkers, and friends who really connect. I was on my way to building that and it all just got taken away from me. I also can\u2019t go back to work, I can\u2019t go back to the same company because they treated me like shit and didn\u2019t support me when I was abused, and I can\u2019t work anywhere else due to my mental health at the moment. \n\nEveryone else is either married, engaged, buying houses, enjoying their careers or having kids.

I was definitely an awkward person (still am to an extent). People use to even comment and say I was awkward too and it really hurt me when people told me that. Eventually I started learning languages as a hobby and I would say this was my turning point. I learned Japanese and became conversational at it. I pushed myself to speak whenever I could. This increased my social skills by alot. It made me comfortable to speak because if I said something I awkward I could just make t excuse that I was not fluent in Japanese. It also made it easier to talk to people because it gave me something to talk about. I used an app called HelloTalk to practice Japanese. Then I met a Japanese girl on there and we met up an found out we go to the same University and we started hanging  out then started dating. I do not advise using HelloTalk or learning a language for the intention of dating, but I will say that they helped me build up my social skills alot.

Just to preface the above, I was working on improving my social and dating life up there but that fell apart when the fore mention happen. Now I am back I square 1 from when I started when I was 20-21, possibly 22 when I started community college. While I was attending the college I about found 4 that I was genuinely interested. One of them I'll describe briefly was a single mother that was a co-worker then boss about 5 years older than I from Indiana. Thought she was nice to be around and a good person to spend time around and see if something would have started. The only problem was that IN damn near went after you as soon as you started a relationship with her. I planned on quitting my job and planned on giving her my number if she was there when I left which she wasn't unfortunately so I moved on. Still think about her really so maybe I'd have another change later when I moved back.\n\nFast forward tho about a year or two later, I ended up losing my car and then my job, I had to move back in with my mom and finding any job that I could.

We lived in a dorm. She lived in the dorm above us.

The entire year went by, and nothing came of it, which is typical for me and it didn't bother me much at the time, but then...\n\nWe came back for Sophomore year. I didn't really get to see her at all during the summer, but one of my roommates did. His mom threw him a surprise birthday party that summer. I couldn't make it, because I was on vacation with my family, but SHE was there. So me and my roommate are moving in to our new apartment (my former second roommate failed out of his scholarship and had to become a part-time student and commute from home), and his Mom mentions something very interesting at the table while we are at dinner: They went on a date. My roommate and the girl went on a date, and that is all I know. What happened on this date? Did they kiss? Did they have sex? Did they just talk and decide they weren't for each other? WHAT HAPPENED? I was, in an instant, sent into the deepest depression I have ever experienced. It physically hurt to a degree I didn't know was possible. I quickly walked to the bathroom, fully expecting I was going to throw up out of shock. This might seem like an overreaction, but idk what to tell ya. It hit me hard. It was the first time in my life where I felt like I was actually seriously mentally ill and I needed help (I never got help).\n\nLike I said, I don't know what happened on the date. I still have never asked him. Us two actually hung out with her one time at the beginning of sophomore year, and it was kind of awkward. Maybe it was just me. Maybe they didn't find it awkward at all, but I totally forgot how to act around her. She was something entirely different to me now. I still had feelings for her, of course, but now I felt like I had to hide it. I was more closed-off than usual. I was afraid to be TOO NICE to her for fear that they would know how I felt. Eventually she left, and that was the last time we hung out. We've run into each other a couple of times since then, because we both work in the same area at around the same time (yes, I did eventually get a job). 10 months after I found out about \"the date\", when I spiraled into the darkest period of my life, I felt like I might actually be over her, BUT THEN!...\n\nI remembered something that happened during Freshman year. She told me that she wanted to talk with me about something, but she didn't want to talk about it now. She said she was going to text me about later that night. Later that night, I was playing \"Crawl\" with my roommates when she texts me saying that she \"doesn't want to keep me in suspense any longer\" and asking if I have time to talk. I'm honestly really embarrassed to even type out what I did... but... I asked her if she could wait a minute because we were in the middle of a game. She replied with something like \"omg... I GUESS\". She was obviously pretty annoyed. After we finished the game, I texted her back saying I was sorry. She said that it's fine (but is it tho?) and that it was good because she was able to get work done anyway. I asked if she didn't still want to talk to me about whatever it is she wanted to talk to me about. She said that she does, but she can do it another time... and then I never heard about it again.\n\nI. FUCKED. UP.... MAYBE.\n\nWas she going to tell me that she liked me? did I have a legitimate chance at being happy and I BLEW IT??? I feel so bad about what I did. I remembered this like a couple months ago, but for some reason this week it has completely taken over my mind. I CANT STOP THINKING ABOUT IT. I miss her so much. I am at an all time low right now. I just spent the last hour crying about it. I would love to talk to someone about it, but who? WHO? MY ROOMMATE? YEAH RIGHT! He is literally my only friend at school now. He is the only person I interact with on a daily basis, and he is part of what sent me down this spiral of depression in the first place. What if he still has feelings for her? Did he ever have feelings for her? I still don't know, because I'm too afraid if I ask he'll know that I like her and for some reason that feels like the fucking END OF THE WORLD to me! I'm also afraid of what I'll hear. He has a girlfriend now, but that doesn't mean he never had feelings for HER, or even still does! If he does/did like her, then there is no chance for us to be together. It would hurt him, right? I don't want that. I'm also afraid that he's gonna tell me they fucked or something and it's just going to make me even more depressed and frustrated and regretful. REGRET IS THE WORST FEELING A HUMAN CAN EXPERIENCE. REGRET AND LONELINESS. It's amazing to me that I have still never considered suicide. As depressed as I've been the last few years, I have never seen suicide as an option. I'll just continue to suffer in silence, because fuck me, right? That's what my life is. DAMMIT. DAMMIT. DAMMIT.\n\nEvery now and then I think about reaching out to her. The reason varies. Sometimes I think about asking her to play Splatoon, like we used to. Sometimes I think about finally confessing to her, if for no other reason to get it off my chest. Today I had the idea of apologizing for what I did. Even if she wasn't going to tell me she liked me, whatever she was going to tell me was obviously very important to her... and I blew her off. That's awful. I feel so bad. I actually pulled out my phone and was going to text her and I just began panicking. It was like how I felt as a kid going on a new, scary roller coaster times a million. I was fucking hyperventilating at the idea of saying I'm sorry for that thing I did two years ago. I guess that's the question I want to ask. Should I do it? Should I apologize for real this time? I said I was sorry, but I didn't really understand how awful it was what I did until today. I let her down. Regardless of what I wanted us to be, we were friends, and I let her down. Is it worth giving a more sincere apology? Or is it just going to come across as weird. She might read it and know how I feel, which again, is for some reason the end of the world. Should I do something else? Should I just wait until the suffering ends, because it probably will eventually, right? If you actually made it this far, WOW. Thank you for listening. Seriously. It means the world to me. I didn't think it would be this long, but I wanted to say everything. I want to fully express how I feel, because I think that's the best path to feeling better.", "subreddit": "ForeverAlone"}

She walked off and I was standing there in shock because people don't do what she did. \n\nA coworker asked what was she doing? I said, I guess she really didn't want to interact with me.

That is perfectly normal and there's nothing wrong with it. We humans are naturally drawn to the newest things because they are new so its interesting or different. \n\nHowever, as someone who has a soft spot for the classics and is interested in things like The Twilight Zone, Classic Universal Monsters, X-Files, and the 60s Batman show, it does make it harder for me to connect with people who, again, mostly watches newer stuff like Stranger Things and The Office. I do watch newer stuff like the Conjuring movies, The Walking Dead, and MCU. But most of the movies and shows I enjoy were made decades ago.\n\nIt's worth noting I'm fairly young so the majority of the people who grew up with these shows and movies are more likely to be quite older than me and thus not the type of crowd I hang out with because we would in different stages of life. Yes, there are a good number of people out there around my age that check out the classics from time to time, but not the majority.\n\nNote: I do care about the things I enjoy and would never force myself to enjoy things I don't like just to be like the majority.

Once I left no one kept in touch so no friends there. That's fine I thought to myself, I'll just make some friends at my new school. My body had some other plans. I guess it was a combination of anxiety, my medical issues, and the schools atmosphere but I had to switch to online. Not a problem, I'll just go to some local places and meet people.

I was very excited about it as I wanted to have fun and thought it would be fun. In the end, I did not have fun and wish I didn't go. I left after half of the time I planned to spend there as I couldn't take it anymore just wandering around with deep sadness and went home to lie in bed feeling much better. None of the roller coasters scared me or impressed me, they seemed too short and I felt miserable throughout the day, especially while waiting in line with no one to talk to unlike everyone around me. I was pretty much the only person by himself and had to hold my tears back while looking at all those groups of friends laughing together and happy families enjoying themselves. I felt like a ghost among all those normal people, wondering what am I even doing here? How long will this misery last and why should I torture myself making it last?\n\nIt brought me back to my miserable teenage years when I last visited this theme park, my feelings haven't changed since. It has been like this for so long that at this point I'm messed up for life and will never be able to be like others. The saddest thing is that I used to believe that this unfortunate loneliness wouldn't last too long and that \"5 years from now I'll be happy with a social life like everyone\", well here I am much later with my phone contacts only being my parents and sibling.

There are times when I don't think about anything, and I feel good and just go with what I have to do at the moment, and there are times when I relentlessly think about what is wrong and it never stops.\n\nI live alone in a fucking 10m squared apartment with the bed up in the fucking ceiling or I would have no space, I already have hardly any space to do anything except sit there at my computer. Even cutting a tomato for a salad is a fucking adventure. But I live in a big city, I've just began at my first job after graduating and I can't realistically get anything better at the moment.\n\nLiving in this city is shit, I can feel my spirit getting every day more and more tired, and it's only been less than a year, I can't possibly imagine what it's like for people living their entire life like this. There are just people everywhere, noise everywhere, light everywhere. Cars, and the subway, sad faces, sad, tired people, homeless people too, it's like you have to get used to misery if you want to get through your day.\n\nMy career just started, but I'm doubting myself if that's really what I want to do. I've studied video games, and I'm working for a studio, it has been a dream of mine, and I'm really happy to work here, right now. I think. Or at least I should be happy, I found my way, right? And it's not \"just a job\", it's a passion turned into a career. After dropping school for a semester and suffering a depressive episode, I reoriented myself in this career and got what I wanted. I shouldn't complain, as it seems I'm getting somewhere. But I don't see myself in a lot of people working here, not the same way of thinking, not the same way of behaving, not the same interests. It seems like I don't share a lot with people working in video games and gaming culture anymore. And for a crapload of reasons I don't agree with where the industry is going. I have genuine interest in what I do, and I can see myself getting good and evolving, but it's like it doesn't *fulfill* me. But what am I going to do, give up everything? Study woodworking? Go somewhere else and start working in a woodshop? It's a big risk to take, especially if I fail, or worse if I end up working in a shop, and still feel disatisfied, as I am now.\n\nI wanted to start woodworking for a few years now, I bought some tools, some wood, subscription to a shared woodshop where I can go and work, but I never go. I don't exercise, even though I said to myself that I should. I wanted to start playing drums or classical guitar for so long, I haven't made a single step in the right direction for that.\n\nI'm torn apart between two sides, always oscillating. Sometimes I'm romantic, and okay, and know where to go, and what I want, I can chill and take life as it comes; and sometimes I'm just cynical and nihilistic. Sometimes I'm passionate about things, and sometimes I don't care. I'm outraged to the core with what is happening everywhere right now in the world, how everything is being screwed up more and more by the same kind of people, but at the same time I feel detached and don't want to think about it, and I'm convinced there isn't anything we can do. I don't follow politics in my country, I don't care about these people, they're all corrupted liers to me, all the same, I don't vote. And then I'm angry because things are shit.\n\nI have panick attacks, occasionally, but lately it seems they happen every night in the bed before sleeping. I don't know if I'm depressed, if I have anxiety, or if I'm just stupid or asking too many questions, thinking too hard. Sometimes I feel like I'm the dumbest person around, and sometimes I'm convinced that I'm way too smart for my own sake, see or think about shit that most people don't, and it just makes me miserable deep down. I've considered doing therapy, but because of schedule, money, or forgetting, I never did.\n\nI feel disconnected from the world, from my generation, from this age. I work in video games, but I'm more and more cautious with technology, I think I've even managed to fear it. I'm not on any social media, nor do I have a smartphone. My phone is a 20$ brick that servers for calling, texting, and my wake-up alarm. But so much is going on online today, so many people spend so much time on social media, it almost feels like life is happening there right now. I feel like my choice of technology usage is separating me from society, and I just have to live with it.\n\nI have a supportive family, but we only talk on the phone, and I don't want to bother them with it. I just want to say to them that things are ok, because I don't want them to worry. And objectively, things are ok I think. And when I see them I just want to spend some good time with them because we don't see each other often.\n\nI have a group of very good friends, have known them for more than 10 years, and they live nearby. I see them every week or every other week. But I always feel like I can't say any of this to them. Because we see each other in a happy mood, we party, or go watch a movie, or whatever. Also because I don't want to impose myself on them, and I really love these moments when all of these thoughts are quiet, somewhere, and I can just live in the present with people I love.\n\nI miss being in a relationship, having this special person in my life, to whom I am a bit special too. I miss sending them a good night text before sleeping, and good morning the first thing when waking up. I miss having someone with me to talk to when I'm home, I miss romantic affection, physical contact, sex. Just someone to talk about things, silly stuff, nothing, everything, when I feel good, when I feel bad, someone who is there to listen to me, and to talk to me. Someone who would just hold me tight, and the world would instantly be a little better.\n\nI want to say \"I'm not okay\", but then I'll have to explain myself, and I'll feel illegitimate to feel like crap. I have a degree, a job, somewhere to sleep, and have something to eat everyday. There are far worse conditions, especially today. But I still feel like on the verge of crying all the tears of my body, or exploding into the worst anger, too many days of the week, when I'm alone at home.\n\nSo there you have it Reddit, an unnecessarily long complain about everything and nothing at all.", "subreddit": "lonely"}

My wife and I have had a strained marriage for quite a while now, there is almost zero affection in it...  My kids adore me at least.  So I really have no one to go hang out with, drink beers, shoot pool, talk silly.  Of course what I personally think is harder is not having that female attention and affection I crave...

I went back to school at the end of March and on the 2nd of April she asked me out and I told her no because she wouldn't really like me if she really knew me and that I'm nothing special (I have really bad anxiety and I'm really bad at talking to people) so after I told her that i was annoyed at myself for ruining my first proper friendship with anyone. I'm in my 4th year of high school and this was the first time anyone had went out there way to talk to me which made me feel special most people just think I'm weird or they just don't care about me. After a few days of silence from her she messaged me saying that she was sorry and that she shouldn't have asked me out which annoyed me. I was basically making her feel bad because of my stupidity but i never noticed at this point how ignorant i was being, after a few more days of silence we just continued talking like nothing had happened. I would talk to her about anything but in school we would never talk because of how awkward i was so I apologized for being awkward and for not talking to her, everything was going great once again. During the summer she started having problems with some of her friends so the only thing i could think of that would help her was just talking to her and it worked she had totally forgot about them so she told me that she cherished our friendship and that me feel special to the point where I was nearly crying but i never told her that. Towards the end of the summer we had arranged that on the 21st of September we where going to go out (me her and 2 of her friends) and to me at first this seemed like a bad idea, I rarely go out with people because i would much more prefer staying in and playing games but i thought about it and after a few days of considering it i agreed to go, a part of me was scared because this isn't something i do but another part of me was excited to do something different. I really enjoyed myself but for most of the day she was quite which isn't like her which worried me cause i was starting to think that i was doing something wrong or that i had said something that annoyed her but after a while she started talking and being herself again and at the end of the day she wanted to give me something so i said alright waited for to go and get something she came back with a card and gave it to me then walked away from me, it was a birthday card somehow she managed to find out that my birthday was the next day she made me feel special again so went i got home that night i thanked her and told her that i appreciate everything she has done for me. On the 25th of September she hadn't messaged me or send anything since my birthday so messaged i her asking if she was alright and she said that she was fine but i could tell she was lying so i kept asking her if she was alright and she kept telling me to stop asking her but i didn't and told her that she wouldn't stop if it was the other way about and there was something wrong with me but she wasn't telling me so i stopped asking after a while and then about 2 hours later she messaged me saying that she wasted 10 months of her life on someone who doesn't care about her and that she always gave me her all but i never gave i back, she then said that i treat her like i hate her or that i don't who she is and then she said that she does not want to talk to me anymore and that she wants to hate me but she cant so until then don't message her or anything. She said that i gave her mixed signals and that i am scared to talk to her and then told me to fuck off to someone else who's better, I messaged her saying that I should've gave her a definitive answer when she asked me out and that i was sorry for nor realizing i was being selfish and ignorant. I haven't messaged her at all but i don't know what do, i feel like i have lost something special and its all i can think about even if i try to distract myself i just cant I'm lost, i have lost my only friend and now i'm back to where i was 11 months ago with no friends.", "subreddit": "lonely"}

They also must have noticed that hanging out with me did not improve their chances with girls by an inch. Think \u201esocial proof\u201c, if you\u2019ve ever wasted time with pick up artists. \n\nTo cut it short, I lost them and I barely regret it because we\u2019d have nothing to talk about anyway.

A lot of my family often doesn't talk to me very much. My dad hasn't been the best dad and just this year he completely cut contact. You'd think I'd be happy about that but he's still my dad.

I never saw her again and flew back alone.  I broke down in tears in the airport and employees rushed to my side to find out what the problem was.

I have tried to expand my social circle but have continuously only been able to meet people like myself. Networking is so important.", "author": "Hellblade999", "self_text": "This has led to the feeling that women are \"inaccessible\".\n\nThroughout school my social circles were predominantly male. When I was 17/18 I thought about why I wasn't dating anyone, but I looked around at the social circles in my school and realised I was part of one that was solely male. None of these men knew single women, we were all in the same boat. The friends I made at university were like me and were bad with women. I made some friends with women over the years, but they never knew single women they could introduce me to. One time I met up with an old work friend, and she said she'd bring out her friends one night and we could all meet up. All of her friends were guys. The same pattern has continued throughout my teens and early 20s, and every avenue I explored I've not been able to meet a) many (if any) single women or b) people who know single women. I'm also getting to the age where people in my social groups are getting relationships, so naturally I've ask them if their girlfriends have any friends. They don't. When people say that they should get to know women--taken or not--and it results in being set up with friends, I get frustrated because this has never been my experience at all.\n\nI'm really starting to think it's about social circles and being lucky with them. I've been unemployed for a while now (but may have a chance to escape tomorrow with an interview for a retail job), and it has made me realise how similar applying for jobs and dating are to one another. Unless you have an amazing CV with plenty of experience--the equivalent of being attractive and successful to a potential partner--you're going to have a hard time. When you apply for jobs on sites, it is ultimately a numbers game and employers are going to select the best candidate. You can send out hundreds of applications and get few responses, let alone interviews or job offers. The same is with dating. You can approach person after person, swipe profile after profile, but most of the time you'll get rejected. Sometimes you'll get a conversation, sometimes you'll get a number, even fewer times you'll get a date, even fewer times it'll go anywhere.\n\nSee the similarities? Even more similar is how you can circumvent this hassle by \"knowing\" someone. You know the phrase *it's not what you know, it's who you know*? Well you can avoid the meat grinder that is using job sites and get to know someone who works for the company, and have an easier time finding a career. Same with dating. Most people I know have met someone through friends or through some social situation. And those that did meet someone online persisted at it for years. When you meet someone through friends, you already have some sort of validation that you're not a creep and the ice has already been broken. Without this kind of rapport, it's literally a crapshoot when it comes to putting yourself out there. Sure you also have hobby groups, but even that is chance as to whether you'll meet someone who you like.\n\nMaybe this is why we're told to improve ourselves. Without social circles, we have to rely on meeting people through other avenues. Because our immediate point of contact is failing and we need to resort to other methods, we need to stand out.\n\nI maintain that the social network is the biggest obstacle to dating. All of the guys in my life who want to date but don't have social networks that aren't conducive to meeting single women.", "subreddit": "ForeverAlone"}

{"post_id": "dbighw", "created_utc": 1569878235, "title": "Black Widow (a short horror story)", "author": "jss239", "self_text": "James had always thought himself *different.* And this was what he blamed for his loneliness. Even during the few moments of his life wherein he\u2019d been allowed to taste the bliss of companionship for two years or two days, he\u2019d never stop feeling alone. He longed each and every day for a suitable partner.\n\n\u201cA woman who\u2019s *different,* see? A woman who doesn\u2019t just go along blindly with the crowd; a woman who makes up her own mind about things; a woman who takes *initiative!* And most importantly of all, a woman who doesn\u2019t sell it all down the river to marry some prick who treats her like a plaything in his lucid moments between mourning his father and arm-wrestling with other men in the workplace. *That\u2019s* what I\u2019m looking for, bub. And I tell you: if I\u2019m very, *very* patient, one day she\u2019ll show up on my doorstep and *then* we\u2019ll see who is the fool!\u201d\n\nThe bartender blinked twice and then resumed scrubbing a glass. James looked around drunkenly: the place was entirely empty. Who was he kidding? He was a loser. Everyone knew it: it was burnt into his forehead. *That\u2019s* why women went off and married guys who dropped out of high school and watched Saturday Morning cartoons, eating cereal in their pants and chuckling. They were *fun.* He was not.\n\nA movement somewhere behind him. He spun on a dime, threatening to spin out of control for a minute. Once his eyes adjusted, he saw her: a dark, mysterious woman. She was covered in stygian furs, wearing a head of black gold, and dressed from head to toe in ebony. Her dress was neither too modest, nor too thrilling; her eyes were bright red. She flashed a shark\u2019s tooth at him suddenly and giggled. James let his jaw fall open noiselessly. The woman, behind a veil of tired, fuzzy vision, slithered like an inky shadow into the seat beside James. She placed a cold, somewhat prickly hand on James\u2019 shoulder.\n\n\u201cHi, I\u2019m Eileen. Are you alright?\u201d\n\nJames turned to look at the woman, sobering slightly at the sound of her noirish voice. He shook his face and then smiled, perhaps a bit unnaturally. \u201cYes, ma\u2019am. Right as winter rain. Speaking of which, is it cold in here?\u201d He shivered slightly and buttoned a button on his jacket.\n\nEileen chuckled. It made the hairs stand up on James' neck. He liked the sensation. He let his drunkenness reaffirm its hold; his brain dissolving into warm ginger ale. A dumb smile replaced the unnatural one.\n\n\u201cBuy me a drink? I think *you* may have had enough.\u201d She smiled, her expression more than a little hungry. James nodded slowly and motioned for the bartender. The poor man put down the same dirty glass once more and began pouring something black from a stout bottle, Eileen\u2019s choice. She smiled and James forked over another chunk of change absently.\n\nIt began to dawn on James that the woman seemed quite eager to join him, which based on routine experience was exceedingly odd all things considered. He puzzled at this for a second, before taking another look at her unbelievable build and swallowed the doubt instantly. \u201cSo, uh, what brings you to my dreadful little corner of the world?\u201d\n\nEileen answered calmly, letting the ravenous smile fall for just one second as she spoke. Her throat danced beautifully beneath her chin. James was hypnotized. \u201cI\u2019ve lived here for a while. It only recently occurred to me that\u2019d I\u2019d never visited any of the bars in town, and pickings have been slim lately in my usual circles\u2026 I\u2019ve only just turned twenty-one.\u201d She laughed, but this time it betrayed a hint of sadness.\n\n*Jesus, she\u2019s just a child,* James thought, though he was pretty sure he understood her ambiguity. \u201cI know what you mean. It seems like the whole world moves as one body, dancing, making love, working and playing together and calling out to one another in the streets. And here I am.\u201d He repeated her uncomfortable chuckle. \u201cSorry, not trying to sound like a second-rate poet.\u201d\n\nEileen\u2019s eyes lit up. \u201cNo, no, I understand *exactly* what you mean! It\u2019s not our fault that we\u2019re different. Why listen to them? Why judge ourselves by their standards, no matter how many of them there are? I could take or leave them all.\u201d She shrugged. \u201cAnd if things keep getting worse out there, it won\u2019t be much longer before I get my wish.\u201d She sipped from her drink and sighed.\n\nJames motioned the bartender again, who gritted his teeth violently before obliging. Despite his current inebriation, the moment was too unreal to pass up. It felt like destiny, picking up another vodka and downing it all at once. The two loners sat and chatted warmly in the ghostly pallor of The Crystal Ship for a while, before Eileen whispered in James ear, her cold breath tickling his eardrums and causing the blood in his body to gush all at once:\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s go to my place.\u201d\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\nThey didn\u2019t talk much on the ride over. James wasn\u2019t sure how he would have escaped the bar had Eileen not showed up, perhaps he would have slept on the street, but he was glad to be in her tiny black-and-red vehicle humming along the highway as it materialized in front of the headlights. He was partly dozing. She kept talking though. He didn\u2019t notice much of it, but he did fancy that at one point, she\u2019d said something quite like:\n\n\u201cThey *never* last. But you\u2019re different. I can tell.\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\nJames didn\u2019t commit to memory the steps he took that lead him from the beautiful stranger\u2019s car. Indeed, most of the entire afternoon seemed bound to disappear like a wonderful dream by morning. Perhaps he\u2019d been a fool to drink the night away like this; after all here was his greatest fantasy realized! Someone so fun, so vibrant, so beautiful, and so *dark.* It thrilled him to his core. Eileen, there could be no doubt, was *different!* She took *initiative!* He felt his body sink like a missile into the soft black cotton that surrounded him, and he smiled, the first real smile he\u2019d smiled in a long time.\n\nEileen came out of the bathroom and they kissed. Oh, how her red jewels flashed so subtly! Oh, how her crimson lips wrapped themselves around his! *Oh, Jesus,* he thought: *her tongue.* Like a cat\u2019s tongue. He closed his eyes and fainted a little.\n\nSuddenly, Eileen jerked him away and held him upright, letting his drunken head loll uselessly around. \u201cAre you okay? I don\u2019t want to do this unless you\u2019re okay with it.\u201d *Oh, how innocent!* This young femme fatale, this Lolita; surely, it must be a dream! James took hold of his features for just long enough to commit himself with: \u201cI\u2019m yours.\u201d\n\nEileen giggled, the hunger he\u2019d seen earlier flashing up vividly once again. She disappeared once more into the bathroom, and James let himself collapse backward into the ebony wrappings underneath him. For one last moment of bliss, he felt butterflies dance in his belly as he closed his eyes gently. Suddenly, the creaking of the hinges: *game time.* Would it be better to die after this? Since nothing else could ever *hope* to top it? James stewed on that as he opened his eyes, took one look at Eileen, and sobered up immediately.\n\nEileen was dressed in what could only be described as sexy scrubs, perhaps a \u2018hot nurse\u2019 Halloween costume of some kind, only they were pale red, and from her chin dangled a thin cotton mask. Her hands were gloved with black rubber, and on her feet, she wore fiery red stilettos.\n\nA metal tray that she had wheeled out of the bathroom lay beside her. In one of her gloved hands, she held what looked like a large syringe, only the end had some kind of rubber wrapped around the tip. She held it up to her face and giggled, looking at James gleefully. Her rubber gloves made an awful *scrunching* noise as she did so, and James\u2019 eyes widened.\n\n\u201cUm, what is all this?\u201d\n\nEileen looked a little surprised. \u201cWhat do you mean? Surely, you don\u2019t mean to tell me you\u2019ve never done anything like this before. I took you for a ladies\u2019 man.\u201d\n\nJames sobered up a little more and raised himself up on the bed with his useless arms. \u201cUh, I\u2019m not exactly sure what you mean.\u201d\n\nEileen looked at him the way one would regard a giant crab monster. \u201cDidn\u2019t your parents ever tell you about the birds and bees?\u201d\n\nJames began to scoot himself gingerly across the spiderweb surrounding him, but the bed seemed to gain the upper hand. His weak arms finally gave and he was lying flat once more. Eileen took two steps forward and towered over him. He gulped. \u201cWhat did they tell *you* about them?\u201d\n\nEileen reached towards his bare thigh playfully. \u201cThey didn\u2019t. They were really uncomfortable talking to me about it, especially my mother. They say she *loved* the boys in her day, but after she had me she turned into an old crone. She closed herself up and started going to church every Sunday. She hoped I would never grow up; *never* find out how sex worked; how to make love. But I learned.\u201d Eileen smiled. The hairs on the back of James\u2019 neck stood up. He didn\u2019t like it anymore.\n\n\u201cYep, I figured it out all on my own. I didn\u2019t need anyone else\u2019s help. Once you\u2019ve seen a few movies it\u2019s pretty easy to tell what the silhouettes are doing.\u201d She fondled the cold probe in her hands. \u201cI picked it up just fine I think.\u201d\n\nJames didn\u2019t hesitate this time. \u201cI want to go. I don\u2019t want this. I\u2019m scared.\u201d He nearly called for his mother. His blood, though, never stopped pulsing. His body still seemed quite pleased. Eileen noticed and looked up at his frown, again hurt. She pulled his limp body close.\n\n\u201cI thought you were *different!\u201d* She tossed him back into the caress of the bedding. \u201cNo, you\u2019re no different at all.\u201d Tears streamed down her face. \u201cYou\u2019re just like everyone else.\u201d\n\nJames felt something break in his head, and his muscles relaxed. She was crying. He was defenseless. His flesh tried to crawl away from his bones, but he held them firmly in place with the fatal words: \u201cI am different. I am.\u201d\n\nThe black widow looked down at him from behind her hands, confused and regretful. She honestly didn\u2019t even feel in-the-mood anymore. James rose from the bed and put a hand on her shoulder. \u201cI am yours. I meant it. I just got frightened is all.\u201d\n\nJames bit back tears of his own. \u201cI\u2019ve never done this before.\u201d\n\nEileen smiled a viscous, acrid smile and pulled the mask in front of her cherry lips. She raised the probe once more. \u201cDon\u2019t worry. I\u2019ll walk you through *everything.\u201d*\n\nJames could now see clearly the things laid out on the trolley next to him: electric drills, tweezers, a flat-headed screwdriver, tourniquets, handcuffs, and a most phallic-looking blade with a long pink silicone hilt. Something else tore loose in his brain. This time there was no going back.\n\nEileen lowered the metal probe and clamped her razored mouth upon his, sucking his flesh like a straw. \u201cYes, finally. Finally. I *knew* you were different!\u201d she cried in ecstasy. Feeling the probe sink into his most sacred flesh, James screamed until his lungs gave out.\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\nThree hours later, the poor little spider sat weeping in its web, a truly pitiful insect. Her red makeup smeared with tears and her crimson hair matted with blood, she wept louder, louder, louder until the echoes nearly reached the other side of the city. A few people turned their TV\u2019s up; some sang along with it; others felt themselves weeping as well, quite familiar with the tune. It was loneliness. Every person on this block and on every block that has ever existed knew it well.\n\nEileen wiped a few tears from her face and tried to cheer herself up. She was just *different*, that was all! Yeah, it was everyone *else\u2019s* fault for her crushing loneliness. Who made them judge, jury, and executioner?\n\nShe bundled her legs quietly into her arms and squeezed her arachnid body close. As a gentle breeze flew in from the window, hearing the commotion and coming to comfort her, Eileen said the words out loud once again, wishing upon a star:\n\n\u201cA man who\u2019s *different.* A man who doesn\u2019t just go along blindly with the crowd; a man who makes up his own mind about things; a man who takes *initiative!* And most importantly of all, a man who can last!\u201d The floodgates broke and she began to sob once more. *\u201cThey never, ever last!\u201d*", "subreddit": "ForeverAlone"}

Sorry for this rant.", "author": "jobunnhei", "self_text": "In highschool I was excited to date and make lots of friends. I seem to just become friends with outcasts who move away after a year. People forgot me easily and took advantage of me. Never got even close with anyone I had a crush on.\nThen after dreaming for highschool to be over, I imagine college to be much better. Still no love, not many friends, not much of anything. Still feeling forgettable and unnoticeable. \n\nLife is constantly dreaming of something better to happen but it doesn't. I know I \"have control over how I respond to things and what actions to take\" but it feels so hard. It feels like I don't know how to. I feel like there's no one to talk to anymore since every response I get from a friend is dismissive or \"you should go to therapy\" \"you should take meds\" when I already have tried and they know it.  \n\nEveryone wants to be happy so they try to show it in media and such but then it causes an idealization and expectation in people's heads that don't get met.\n\nI'm hoping after college things are better and I'll be free but I feel like I'll be more alone than ever and miserable. Casually thinking of suicide. What is there in life? I guess I have family left. \n\n\"Think positively\"  I wish I could. \n\"Be grateful for what you have\"  I wish I wasn't feeling down. I know people have it worse than me. \n\"You're young! You have time!\" Time runs out fast and I think I've already wasted so many years of my life when this was supposed to be \"prime time\". \n\nI feel like I'll never be happy.

He is also really overweight and managed to find a decent looking serious gf on Facebook and they moved in with eachother about a month ago.\n\nI guess I may be a little bitter and frustrated by it..and now all the attention has been full blast on me and how I am single and can't  find a gf. I am getting shit from everyone. My aunt called me to say she was shocked by my brother finding someone and that what the hell is wrong with me. My dad's uncle jokingly told me I'm gonna die alone at home. So I feel like I've been tossed in a deeper hole of depression and hopelessness, when I am already overwhelmed by the stress of my life. I just feel numb to everything.\n\nEarlier this year I had to cut a girl off that I was talking to for about 3yrs. I was stupid enough to believe that I was the only one that she wanted to be with and I fooled myself into thinking she was the girl I've been waiting for and I was finally going to make it happen this year and meet her. Long story short..I was just one of many and she never took me seriously. It really gutted me in the beginning but I managed it..still bothers me sometimes and I still check her fb. \n\nI am trying to do something with my life instead of distracting myself with meaningless things and I am struggling alot. Trying to start a business by yourself with no money and no partner is impossible. So I am not sure what to do anymore. Just wanted to let this all out somewhere since I just get ignored by so-called friends and family.", "subreddit": "ForeverAlone"}
