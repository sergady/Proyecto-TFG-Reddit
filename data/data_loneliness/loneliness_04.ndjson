Even if it\u2019s just me letting it out.\n\nFrom my first memory as a child at my 5th birthday party, I\u2019ve always been able to remember one thing very clearly. I don\u2019t have any real friends. I grew up in a small town with a population of 5,000.  I grew up on the same street as my cousins, who were the same age as me. There two girls were my very first friends, and even at such a young age, I immediately became aware that I was the 3rd wheel. They spent every day together, going over to each other\u2019s house, even though mine was in between theirs. I only remember being with them on rare occasions when I would ask my mom to plan a play date. It hurt, after all, I was only 5. It hurts to see people post things about being friends with someone since they were 5 years old, or since elementary school, because I know i\u2019ll never have that kind of a bond with anyone. \n\nFast forward to elementary school, there were only about 80 kids in my grade. I don\u2019t remember having any friends up until 3rd grade.  These girls were not real friends, though. But they were all I had at the time. I was in the same class as all of them, but I was constantly bullied by them. I was blinded by the thought that I had real friends, so I let them torment me. \n\nIt wasn\u2019t until 5th grade that I stood up to them, on the very last day of school. After that, we were no longer \u201cfriends\u201d. I went into middle school and still struggled to find friends. I had a few, but they were only in school friends. I never spent any real time with them. \n\nThis is when I began to rely on the internet as my main source of a social life. I\u2019d call people from all over the country, and sometimes even the world. I generally met them from virtual games. While I thought this was saving me, I was really digging myself into a deep, deep hole. \n\nAfter I graduated from middle school, I had no friends. Everyone had different classes, and I still had social anxiety from when I was younger. I believed that everyone hated me, and I felt completely alienated. I left high school in 10th grade and did online school. I continued talking to people online and thought that was enough for me. But it isn\u2019t. \n\nNow, I\u2019m 18 and it\u2019s not like I can go back to public school, i\u2019m supposed to be graduating in June. I\u2019m still far from getting my diploma, too. I want to go to college at some point but it isn\u2019t an option this year. I just don\u2019t know where to even start. I see kids I went to school with on snapchat with their friends and I feel like I missed my opportunity to even be a teenager. I never got the first love, the best friend, the house parties, the prom, the midnight adventures, cramming for tests, nothing. I\u2019m just alone. \n\nEveryone i\u2019ve talked to about this has said \u201cTry joining clubs or go to college\u201d, but there really aren\u2019t any clubs at all around here. I\u2019ve done plenty of research. It\u2019s just a wasteland for opportunity. There is nothing for me here. \n\nMy brother who is 32 said I can come live with him. It\u2019s a 14 hour drive from my house to his, so i\u2019d be in a completely different state, in a town that is more populated. I just don\u2019t know if i\u2019d be making the right decision by doing this. If anyone has advice it would be greatly appreciated, Or if you\u2019ve gone through something similar i\u2019d love to hear about it.", "subreddit": "lonely"}

I thought he was getting defensive because he had to work hard to look that way. I was wrong and he told me that two weeks ago he was a 5'2\" Asian guy. I said, what are you talking about? Are you telling me you grew a foot and changed ethnicity in two weeks? He said yes because he bought this expensive shower. I thought he was joking but I know about the omega shower. He said he made money in the stock market. Over the past few months he said he's made hundreds of thousands of dollars. He said he was using escorts but it didn't help with his being lonely because of his lack of companionship that escorts can't provide. One day he saw a shower that was $120,000 and could turn people from unattractive to attractive. I said holy crap, you have the omega shower that I wish I could use. He said he didn't know it had a name but it helped him become this 10 male model looking guy. \n\nI asked him if I could use the omega shower. He said that it wouldn't be fair since he paid $120,000 for it and I'm asking to use it for free. I told him I was desperate and would pay him what little money I had. He looked at me and said, I assume you have never had sex or a relationship. I said no, and he said, you can use the omega shower. After work I went over to his house. It was a large expensive looking house. He let me in and had to get through the 40 womenz that were over his house. He showed me his bathroom and I saw the omega shower. It is more glorious in person than what we see in the online picture that we post. \n\n10 minutes later I stepped out and looked in the mirror.

I ended up taking 10 womenz with me and had sex with all of them. I'm no longer FA. I'm chad. \n\nIf I could succeed, you should be able to as well. You need to have good hygiene, dress well, get therapy, get a haircut, and join hobby groups. 2 more womenz just broke my front door down and are demanding to have sex with me.

She was the 12th girl to reject me so far and I was simply left exhausted and weary. My heart shirks with jealousy whenever I eye a couple in public, very much in love, sharing a hug on the escalator, or simply resting on each other in public transport.\n\nSince then, I have had a few more infatuations but I constantly remind myself that I cannot develop false hopes, that there exist absolutely no hope of success. \n\nThis prevents me from developing crushes, but have also left me empty, both emotionally and physically. I leave for work, I do my job, I return home, read a book, and the cycle repeats endlessly. My life is a void of emptiness.\n\nThe phrase; \"it's better to have loved and lost\", loses its meaning once the possibility of severe depression outweighs the potential emotional value of a relationship. Survival overtakes instinct, where I am somewhat content to be alone, with a book, consuming a decent meal, grateful for a healthy life.\n\nI have given up, and I don't think I can ever regain the passion of my past hobbies or invest yet another commitment to pursue a girl with little payoffs.\n\nI am just so sad.", "subreddit": "ForeverAlone"}

Furthermore, even fewer are interested in being what I'm looking for - and I completely understand that I'm searching for someone who is the rarest of rare. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTo begin, here's a little primer on \"who I am\" - in hopes it catches someone's eye. I'm 34 (obviously), of the male gender, and I reside in Kentucky. I'm tall-ish, 6'4 and stocky \"football player\" build - though I've never played any kind of sports. I really don't understand how football works honestly, I've never paid much attention to it. So I'm definitely not a sports jock who's glued to ESPN every weekend. That being said, I'm also not a gamer geek. I had an XBox a few years ago and gave it to my neighbor's kid because I never used it. I do still have my original Nintendo in the closet though, I've still never beaten the original Super Mario Bros. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI have a professional career in financial services, I'm an insurance agent for one of the largest nationally known insurance companies. It's not what I particularly enjoy doing, but it keeps the lights on. I also own my home, vehicles, and a pontoon boat that I've been restoring. My hobbies include aviation (I am licensed to fly), ham radio, electronics tinkering, and being involved in the kink lifestyle. I have no children, but do have a small yorkie. He's my boy. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow, I'm going to explain something that you'll probably not like, but hear me out. I'm married. I'm happily married of twelve years this November. That's not going to change, ever. I'm looking for someone who is okay with this, who is understanding of this, and most importantly, someone who could develop an interest in becoming part of my family in the future. She and I both are polyamorous - or more specifically, polyexclusive. I hide nothing from her, she knows I'm typing all of this out. She hides nothing from me, she's reading everything I say. We base our entire relationship and lives on honesty and transparency. I know many of you are going to scorn me for posting this, or scorn me for my choices in life, and that's okay. You're free to cast stones as you wish - but understand - my life is mine and nothing you can say or do will change what brings me happiness. I feel that love and emotion are limitless feelings. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf you're still following me after that bomb drop, I'm impressed and excited that I've not appalled you so far. Please consider messaging me because I'd love to tell you more about me, my life, my lifestyle, in hopes you can find something within me that will compliment your life as well. \n\n&amp;#x200B;", "subreddit": "lonely"}

I've been trying to not give a shit that people don't care for me like I care for them, but it's hard man.\n\nI just want to bash my head against a wall repeatedly so I can crush my brain to get out the feeling of sadness and being alone with myself. The thought of just dying makes me feel better because then I can escape all the problems I have within myself. I can't deal with myself, I hate how emotional I am. I hate how I can never really connect with people because I dont have a connection with myself. When i feel alone, for me there's no focusing on myself and getting myself better, it's just constant stupid thoughts of how worthless I am, what i could be doing but I'm not doing because even if I do something that I think will make me happy I feel indifferent about it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI don't know anymore! I can't even answer what makes me happy anymore.\n\nIf i died today or when ever, I know people will miss me, but I feel ???? about it.\n\nhonestly, I'm ready to just end it because I'm tired. I'm just so exhausted with living. It doesn't feel good to be alive anymore. It feels like a stupid roller coaster I want to get off.", "subreddit": "lonely"}

A day to laugh and partake in pranks and jokes. For me, not so much. One year ago today, i got married to the love of my life, or at least i thought i did. Between that day up until now, she asked for a divorce, told me she cheated on me with her step brother, and had cheated on me before she came to Canada(where i live) to be with me in person(we had been dating online), and lied about everything, including her drinking. And if that didn't hurt enough, well, i got married to her at 19. I'm gonna be a divorcee at 20 years old. Oh boy, mistakes were made. And now it's the anniversary. It's almost ironic, considering i feel like a fool. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI don't know why I'm posting this. Maybe I'm looking for attention, maybe I'm wanting to talk to someone, or maybe i just needed to vent somewhere. Part of me wants to say I'm looking for people to talk to or to make friends, but honestly i don't feel like that would make me feel any different. I'm considering posting this in the make new friends sub and the meet new people sub, but i don't think this post qualifies in either of those subs. Plus, i don't see the point in posting in those places, since this post is more so just me venting. Not to mention, this probably isn't the best way to make friends, since it's a post of sadness and people may only talk to me because they feel bad for me. I don't know. Life is confusing. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMy only saving grace to get me through today are these two things:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMy family being around me and helping and supporting me throughout the day today.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMy favourite show returns today after being on a hiatus for the last 4 months.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf anyone read this, thanks for reading it.

I mostly have a friendly relationship with her.\n\nTo be honest it's mostly awkward with her. She's really shy (mostly because she is foreign and she avoids talking so that she doesn't make mistakes) and I am too. So we don't talk that much at school. But it's clear that she doesn't dislike me, it's just ambiguous how much she actually cares about me.\n\nHERE'S THE STORY\n\nWe met in the park and studied. I got tired and this is when I decided to try and see what would happen if I had some contact.\n\nShe was very tired and anxious about the exam the day after, so I put a hand on her back while I reassured her. I'm pretty sure that, whatever the best approach was, that wasn't it. She wasn't really responding in any way, so I don't know what to think of that.\n\nLater we're walking and she's being negative again, she looks pretty bummed so I ask her \"can I hug you\" (as you do) and she said yeah. But then I did a weird over the shoulder hug while walking. I don't know why I thought it would work but it didn't.\n\nIn the end I greeted her and she waited for me to kiss her cheeks as a goodbye (which I did last time). I don't know if that's a positive thing or if she was just thinking \"oh he's probably expecting me to do that\".\n\nNow throughout all of this she didn't change her behavior at all. She wasn't using a different tone or talking to me any less. It's like nothing happened. So again, I don't know how to interpret this.\n\nI hadn't realized how shy she was when I started thinking I had a chance, but at this point it's pretty clear that it would take more time than whatever I have on my hand to get close to her, and I'm not getting any strong signals that she likes me.\n\nHowever she's a good friend and I don't mind hanging out with her without expecting anything to happen. So what do you guys think?\n\nTL;DR: I hung out with a classmate and \"hugged her\" awkwardly. She didn't really react to it. I don't count anymore on anything happening between us, but I also think we should keep being friends", "subreddit": "ForeverAlone"}

However, In a sort of defiance to my words she just leans in and kisses me.

The problem is she was ignoring me.and Eventually they started texting each other.By late September My depression hit a all time high and I was so sad. She was ignoring me and only talking to my brother and not even say hi to me even when I\u2019m right in front of her.\n\nThe worse was October when I would just cry and cry and eventually i started crying everyday while my brother and her would talk and laugh and go out to eat after school.\n\nBy November there were still talking and I decided that I couldn\u2019t take it anymore so I would just go up to her and start a conversation. Of course she didn\u2019t want to talk so it was only small conversation. Eventually I told my friends about the situation and they decided to \u201chelp\u201d ( as in let me stalk her on social media). November 29 was my birthday and I said that\u2019s enough and I went to her. She notices it\u2019s my birthday so she gave me a hug but then I asked her \u201cwhy are you ignoring me\u201d And we had a whole conversation and I told her to promise to it least say hi and she did. But she broke the promise. \n\nThe beginning of December was disaster (sort of) as my crush gave a gift to him and hugs while I get nothing. Mid-December was when my depression bar was finally going down as she was starting to have a long decent conversation with me but at that point it didn\u2019t matter to me what matter is my brother and her and that I must not let them be together. I started to eavesdrop my brother and my cousin and they were talking about her. My brother was telling my cousin that she is telling him that she like someone and brother and cousin instantly thought it was my brother(I only have one brother) but it sounded like my brother didn\u2019t want to date her.\n\nOn January 2nd 2019 at 1:45 my crush was waiting for my brother while I was still in class around 2:20 I went to get water and I saw my brother by himself and for that very moment I knew that something happened ( i don\u2019t know how the fuck I noticed but I did).so I\u2019m like in class thinking did he rejected her? When the bell rung at 3:00 I go to this program and my brother and my crush go to(that\u2019s when I first met her). I was waiting for them to show up and then my crush sister comes in and one of the counselor asked where is her sister(my crush) and her sister goes she started yelling at me to go away and that she needed time and right as she said that I was the most happiest teen in my life.

Sometimes I shut my eyes and create my own \"world\" where people actually appreciate me on a more intimate level. Small kids running around playing. A hot meal on the table. A woman who actually took the time to cook for me. The warmth of her body against mine after my jacket comes off. Her laughter. The perfume she's wearing. Maybe I made a pit stop on the way home and bought her some roses. Maybe I surprised her with her favorite baked good. \n\nThen my eyes open. They're warm and damp. Nobody is waiting for me.

I have always completely and without fail been the pursuer. Ever since I was little I've given everything I have to anyone who would take it, just loving life and making people happy and loving on people, hoping one day I might make a friend who would love me back.\n\nIn the end, I was taken advantage of and abused way too many times. I let myself be a stepping ladder for my \"friends\" to climb on and elevate themselves out of their issues, then promptly forget about and ignore, until a problem came up and they needed another \"boost\".\n\nFinally I had enough, I couldn't take being drained dry anymore by those who were supposed to care about me. I gave so freely of energy I was already lacking, and never got a ounce of support in return. So I thought \"what happens if I stop pursuing? Do they care enough about me to pursue me?\" The answer is a fat fucking no.\n\nNow, I have boundaries for myself. I won't be taken advantage of again. I won't set myself on fire to keep someone else warm. Never again. But I still search for a healthy friendship vigorously.\n\nYet somehow, I've never met another pursuer. With everyone I've ever met in all my searching and attempts, I can put in all the effort in the world or none at all, it ends the same. I've come to the realization that if I don't do all the work to hold a friendship together, it will inevitably fall apart. Nobody wants to put in the effort.\n\nThis realization has broken me. These last months I still searched, but each time I'd find a potential match I'd just feel so hopeless and pressured to perform (knowing the entire friendship depended on my performance) that I would avoid interaction entirely til it died off. Now I have no energy. No drive to try. I'm still as lonely as I was at the start and with nothing to show for my previously tireless efforts.\n\nI even tried searching for other \"pursuers\", but I think it's too late now. I don't have the energy to try *at all* anymore. The weak and shallow ties I still have are fading fast as I wither away under the force of my own futility.

The feelings of loneliness were/are pretty difficult for me, and I got tired of hearing the oft-spouted \"meditation, therapy, and exercise\" suggestions. While these factors help, they are also obvious. I wanted to share some of the smaller, weirder, and more obscure techniques that I discovered helped my feelings of isolation:\n\n* **Live gamer streams** \\- I am not a gamer, but found that tuning in to twitch videos was really helpful on those difficult nights where the loneliness felt intolerable. Even if I have the window minimized or scaled to super small proportions in the corner of my screen as I tend to other business, it's a relief to hear someone else in real time. It's helped me to think of it as a casual chill sesh with another person with both of us doing our own thing, together.\n* **\"Study with me\" videos** \\- This one is more for the students, but could also be a good option for those who don't like the noisiness of video game streams. I am in a pretty rigorous academic program and spend many days and nights studying alone. Not only does this leave less time for social engagement, but it is hard for others to relate to, and thus can be isolating. I've found that \"study with me\" videos help me feel less lonely, and also motivates me to stay focused. A double-win!\n* **Weighted blankets** \\- I always hated the idea of weighted blankets. I thought they'd be too hot or make me feel trapped, but let me tell you: *weighted blankets are the good shit*. Something about the heaviness distributed over you is surprisingly calming. If you are an affectionate person with no people or pets to cuddle, a weighted blanket is a great way to mimic the feeling of being held.\n\nThese techniques are not going to alleviate the root cause of my problems, but they sure have helped me take the edge off some tough nights. I'd love to hear if anyone else has any creative solutions to share! At the very least, I hope my techniques prove helpful to you. Just remember, folks: we will get through this!

I hope to find some clarification on how I'm feeling and would like to know I'm not the only one. Please give me direction or help with solutions to the following;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBack story: I grew up in a small town, my parents seemed happy. I have 3 siblings; an older brother an older sister and a younger brother. We had it made, we rode bikes with friends to school and to the beach in the summers. In 5th grade my parents decided to get divorced, my dad moved out with a woman he as having an affair with through work. I found out about the affair when i was in 7th grade. My mother is an alcoholic and she was sober for 25 years leading up to my older brothers 25th birthday. Before he turned 25, my younger brother was entering the high school i attended and he was involved with drugs and a high profile gang. I learned this information through friends as well as him being boastful about his involvement. I talked to my parents and my mom decided that with her full time job she could no longer take care of him. He moved in with my father his freshman year of high school. My mom relapsed and ended up in rehab. She found a boyfriend through her new job as a counselor for substance abuse. I spent countless nights finding her eating raw chicken in the kitchen or passed out drunk in the family room. I became a recluse in my room. (my room was in the down stairs of a bi-level home i made it a man cave with a mini-fridge) I soon became a room mate of my moms. I refused to spend time with her because it made me resentful.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMoving onto the future: I will add a tl;dr disclaimer at the end, Im doing my best to describe my situation. My work history is interesting but Ive worked my way towards a director position for a company at 26 years old. It forced me to relocate and I have started to notice signs that living on my own I am extremely unproductive. I know i have earned the job I have and take it seriously but my concerns are how i conduct myself when I'm alone. My new apartment is a mess and i have no desire to take care of myself or contact friends or family. It has ruined my motivation completely. I would like to hear from other people who live alone and understand how they live a productive lifestyle. I feel as if I was more productive when i had struggles to deal with. Now that I am self sufficient I am lost.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\ntl:dr I have trouble functioning as a human being living alone. plz help ", "subreddit": "lonely"}

She was in a wheelchair but her exact disability was never actually specified. In the dream I went into my local Job Centre for an appointment and while I was waiting this girl in a wheelchair just happens to be sitting next to me. She starts talking to me and in contrast to my usual nature, I start talking back. She tells me about her disability and how it affects her, and I tell her about my Asperger's and how that affects me, and we somehow bond over our shared disablements. We must have been talking for about half an hour and things were going so well that she gave me her phone number as we left. Cut forward to some time later and now we're on a date and things are going so well that I kiss her on the cheek. Well that's the point at which I wake up.\n\nI think this dream ultimately sums up everything I fantasise about. How often is it that someone shows an interest in me and makes the effort to get to know me? How often do I feel to speak honestly and openly with people? How often do I feel a genuine connection with anybody? How often do I have the confidence to talk to a complete stranger? Yeah, pretty much never. Also it sums up the fact that in order to have any chance of dating I need to find a girl who is in some way also flawed. Yes everybody has flaws of some kind, but most don't have something like Asperger's that makes social interaction a daily struggle. Most normal women have active social lives, plenty of friends and so many dating options that a guy like me wouldn't even be at the bottom of their list since I wouldn't even make the list in the first place. I need to find a girl who is also lonely, ignored by most guys and just wants to find a girl who likes her for who she is. I know that sounds like I just want to find a girl who's so desperate that she can't reject me, but it's not really about that. It's more about forming a connection. I have almost nothing in common with the majority of normal women, and if I was to date one we couldn't truly connect and I'd always feel jealous of her more privileged position. Whereas if I was to date someone who has some flaws similar to myself, there's a far better chance of me being able to understand her and her being able to understand me, and it would be a much more equal relationship. Unfortunately this scenario was just a dream and I can't realistically imagine it happening in real life. But it's sad to think that for a lot of people, meeting a stranger hitting it off and then going on a date with them is actually a fairly normal occurrence. ", "subreddit": "ForeverAlone"}

We\u2019ve had our arguments before, but I\u2019d never thrown so much shit at him before in my life. The worst part is, as I said, he did absolutely nothing wrong.\n\nI know I\u2019m not on r/AmITheAsshole, and I\u2019m not asking that question. I *know* I\u2019m the asshole. But I\u2019ve calmed down, recognized myself for the freak I am, fell into a slump, and reflected on the past years of my life.\n\nI\u2019m still wondering on what I should do next.\n\nFor now, I\u2019ve been trying to come to terms the fact that I\u2019ll probably be an anomaly for the rest of my life--even among other people--and none of *them* are to blame. Though, any suggestions would be appreciated. I kind of feel lost right now.\n\nOh, and sorry if this comes off as poorly-articulated--feel free to ask me about anything if you feel so inclined.", "subreddit": "lonely"}

That in the end everyone will let you down. No one will ever truly want, help, be there, or even care.  I know for me this is right 100%  as much as I would love to be wrong I'm always right. And I learned that the hard way...\n\n...I was 4yrs old at the beach with my dad and twin brother. My dad was on the shore and didn't swim b/c he didn't want to get wet. So he watched us I guess. I swan out too far and carried away by the current, swept under the pier.  Luckily caught the pillar barely able to keep my head above water. Screaming for help the current kept sweeping the ground lower and lower. It seemed like my dad looked right at me but never moved. As the waves pushed harder and harder I knew I couldn't hold on much longer so I took a chance and swam as hard as I could for shore.  200 yards down from where we were I finally made it. That's when I learned that I couldn't depend on anybody but myself.\n\nHard lesson to learn so young.  Didn't have a childhood after that always thinking every situation.  Not that I'm stubborn and want to do things on my own just I can't trust anybody.  Every time I've tried to I end up getting hurt or let down.  Affection feels unnatural because i know their expecting or wanting something out of it.  I don't expect sympathy or anyone to care. I know to everybody else I'm either a burden, a problem, or holding them back.  Hard not to believe that when that's what I've been told my whole life by parents, family, friends, or significant others.   \n\nI need to remember that because everytime I forget I end up hurt.

After seeing her with some guy a few weeks ago, I figured, that\u2019s that. Thing us, I still see her around my building frequently. Today, while heading down an elevator, I saw her. But what really upsets me now is something that happened less than a hour ago. I\u2019m walking to the bus stop that, for the record, I\u2019ve also seen her at. I\u2019m crossing the street when out of the corner of my eye, I see her. She goes ahead of me for 10 seconds before literally running the rest of the way to the bus stop, which was at least a minute away. I just kept walking at my normal pace but it was clear now that she does not like seeing me near her. I\u2019ve mentioned this also in my other posts.

{"post_id": "b9knnv", "created_utc": 1554424806, "title": "Characters In Search of An Exit", "author": "fierycharm", "self_text": "Where do I start? Well, I was watching tv when I stumbled upon what was probably the best examples in motion picture as to what it feels like to be forever alone. It spoke to me like nothing else ever before.\n\nIt particularly spoke to me because it explored the hopelessness of being trapped somewhere for an extended period of time, unloved, with no answer as to how long you\u2019ll be there, or how much suffering you will have to endure in utter isolation, with no light at the end of the tunnel. \n\nI finally felt... understood, which is a rare thing to find in movies and tv for people like us. I actually related to a cast of characters for the first time in a long time. It was the most affirming 30 minutes of my life - it was therapeutic. It was an episode of - The Twilight Zone.\n\nI recommend you watch the episode titled \u2018Five Characters In Search of An Exit\u2019. You can see a short, 3 minute summation of the episode [here](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=aHV8r7LsO6k) if you don\u2019t care to spend 30 minutes, but I\u2019d say it was worth it seeing the entire thing. It\u2019s about five unrelated characters who are trapped in a dark silo, with no reason as to why they\u2019re there. It really perfectly displays the utter reasonless loneliness and eventual loss of hope of being stuck somewhere for an undetermined amount of time. Also for once, you can watch characters that you can relate to.\n\nThere\u2019s too much to list out here and discuss, but the episode delves into what a person goes through psychologically when they\u2019re subjected to long-term states of isolation for which they\u2019re deprived, confused and have no ability to escape from. The characters talk of how hopeless it is to attempt an escape because it\u2019s all been tried, laughing at the newcomer who scrambles about trying to escape. They\u2019ve all individually adopted their own answer for the answerless question: \u2018why?\u2019 One suggests they\u2019re really dead, another that they\u2019re in hell or trapped in a dream. I\u2019m sure we can relate to having gone through all of these things - in search of answers. \n\nThe characters have come to the conclusion that there is NO ANSWER to any of it. They\u2019re there because they\u2019re there. This is the coldest, yet most realistic conclusion to come to - that there is no special reason we are forever alone. We just are. There\u2019s no meaning we can attach to it. No rhyme or reason. It just is. I\u2019ll also say that the ending is quite realistic, and fitting, unlike the trash that Hollywood produces today. It\u2019s a fantastic piece of television. It was so relatable it\u2019s crazy - I could feel their pain, confusion, restlessness, despair, and ultimately - hopelessness. It\u2019s such a raw, intangible collection of unpleasant emotions that you can\u2019t do anything with but ignore, or else it drives you crazy. \n\nI hope you guys find some value in this post. Maybe you can relate to the episode, too. After all - we\u2019re all characters in search of an exit, but trapped in a prolonged nightmare.\n\n\nA few notable quotes:\n\n\u201cFive improbable entities stuck together in a pit of darkness.

I probably made each sour with two shots per person, most likely less; drank two or three shots of vodka; another sour; a shot of whiskey with tea and orange that tasted awful; then two shots in tea after taking my nightly nortryptaline when I still didn't feel much. \n\nI hate how much of this awful tasting stuff- $14 whiskey, but I don't like almost anything I've had- I have to drink to feel a buzz.

It's 3:43AM and I am already practically soberish.\n\nSo, my big rant: I am tired of my closest friends on the campus a dude who really doesn't see me as much of a close friend, and my ex. I am tired of everytime I open up or become vulnerable, I get hurt. I am tired of having no one I can confide in. No close friends. \n\nI am also tired of constantly being reminded my college sucks and my degree/college choice was a mistake. I am tired of being reminded I am going nowhere. I am tired of being reminded my brothers are high paid and/or in masters, doctorates, that my cousins are D1 athletes and/or getting art scholarships or music awards. I am tired of never getting to sleep at a good time and constant FOMO.\n\nI was reading about a lady who died but no one found her body for three years, even with her TV being on, because she had no close friends or family, just 'friends of whoever she was dating at the time.'. That could be me so fucking quickly it scares me. \n\nI am also scared that I will fall into a toxic internet community...

He oddly declined, saying that it would take up too much of his revision time. I find this weird, cause he always does so good even without revising a lot, and yknow, 3 hours out of two weeks is hardly a lot.

Feeling a bit down, with how alone I've been recently, I just shrugged it off.\n\nBut now, I learn today that he's thinking about going to an Easter party organised by some other friends.

I have friends in college with whom I enjoy my time and once I'm back to my room I've a roommate and two flatmates. And still I feel lonely. It fucks me up. Especially the nights.

First like anyone I tried dating, any kind of dating in all of its forms. Met with little to no result. I was not a particularly popular person in my school life. Always somehow managed to find myself on the fringe. Always being in envy of those I felt were living it up. In fact the only people who truly have my back are my parents. No one else comes even remotely close. And I could not be more grateful for them. That I almost do not deserve them.\n\nI had a really good life anyway. Parents were not rich but I never wanted for anything. And I got to be happy with a loving family who cared for me and did everything they could. I am older now, moved out but I know they're still there for me.  As I sit here now contemplating my life, and wondering why I find myself single and alone again on a Friday night after almost 25 years of such nights I realize that life is exactly what its supposed to be. \n\nI got to be happy already with human interaction. I got it early in life and it lasted a long time. My relationship with my parents obviously has changed. The nature of life as we all grow older. But the constant is there right now. They're still around and I can still count on them. And that is it. My allotment for meaningful human interaction is up.  I got to have them. And after they're gone I will be forever alone. I will meet people through work or through the select people who still exist in my life. But that will be it. Like the last drink of water in the middle of the desert.\n\nI know from reading a lot of these posts that people come at this from all sorts of walks of life and experience and no one outlook is right or wrong. This one is simply mine. I have seen all manner of people in my life who deserved more and got less and vice versa. Unfortunately too many for vice versa. But it's not for me to decide what they get or don't. All I can do is come to terms with my own existence. My way of understanding why its going the way its going and adjusting defective thoughts to reach plain truth.  One example of a defective thought is wondering about beauty and attraction. Why I would consider someone too beautiful or too ugly for me. Or them considering the same to me. The conclusion reached is that it doesnt mean anything. That it was all in the eye of the beholder. And the inescapable statistic that there is a fringe at zero ie: no one could find me attractive. This gave me for comfort than any pursuit of companionship ever did, the idea that it is completely out of my control and there is nothing I can do about it.\n\nI spend my days now in contemplation like this. Doesn't matter if I am at work, home, anywhere. I keep my thoughts running like this trying to figure how I fit in now to life. I sometimes wish it could be different. But I need to deal with the reality of my situation. I can't always just have it good in life. Always the best, always the luckiest in everything. Life means you do everything right, everything you can, and still not do enough and still fail. I will always be on the fringe and the only thing I can hope for is solace and maybe even tranquility. Happiness is over. I would settle just to stay calm to stay at peace as I watch people move on and experience life and love in a way I never can. Life is over, I just get to keep existing and surviving. \n\n", "subreddit": "ForeverAlone"}

{"post_id": "ba8nmg", "created_utc": 1554582992, "title": "Lost connection to the world", "author": "atari1993", "self_text": "I feel like I fell off the radar. When I was younger, I didn't mind being alone. People were hard to associate with, they didn't care for me. Any time someone did notice me, it was so I could be picked on, bulied, or made example of. I preferred my solitude, and kept to myself unless others made the decision to try and talk to me. I slowly faded from most everyone's view, and people finally left me alone. No more nagging, no more jokes, no more problems. Late into college, after a frustrating and depressing semester, I got placed on some medicine. It took awhile to kick in, to help me focus, to calm me down... but once it took hold, I was seized with an unfamiliar notion: I was alone. This was followed by an equally unfamiliar anxiety: I didn't know what to do about it.\n\nLate in high school, I had made some internet friends. We played games, talked a bit about life, laughed at memes and videos, but I really appreciated the break I had from them during the day. I never got along with my classmates, and spent more time talking to my teachers, and those far older than me. I don't know whose fault it was... I was a bit of a geek, or a nerd. Everyone in my class were all sports fanatics, the outdoorsy types. I was still suffering from childhood asthma, and couldn't run without giving me difficulty breathing. I liked to sit inside, and listen to music and play on computers. We didn't connect.\n\nDuring this time in college, I got diagnosed with Asperger's, or rather I was placed on the autism spectrum. It sure explained a lot, but it never fazed me. I was still a person, I was just thought a little differently about things. This didn't change the desires I had, or the things I could offer to others. If anything, it let me know I needed to try harder. I started to ask, \"how do I meet people?\" to everyone I knew. They didn't know. They met their significant other in high school, or in college. Here I was, about to graduate from a university, without a single friend I could call upon.\n\nI took my first job out of school, and found myself as a 22 year old working alongside people 15-30 years my senior. All married, or happily single. All far too busy to consider hanging out with me. They had their own families, their own obligations, their own friends... they had no time to spare for someone like me. They all assured me they liked me, and people enjoyed working with me... but it was never anything more.\n\nI tried to look elsewhere, but I sadly live in the southeastern United States. The only places you're guaranteed to find people is in a bar, or in a church. I was never comfortable in bars, because they weren't full of single people trying to blow off steam on the weekend... they were meetups and hangouts for couples, families, or pre-made groups just trying to get drunk. I spent more time talking to the wait staff than I did other people, and the wait staff just wanted to get paid and go home, not talk to some dejected kid. I had been dragged to church every sunday for the entirety of my life, and never made a single lasting friend. People knew my name, but they liked me more because I could play instruments for the band, or work their sound system. I recently stopped playing for the church, and aside from the other band members begging I come back to play, nobody's really stepped up to ask what's wrong or if I'm okay. \n\nI eventually tried to meet up with and hang out with the female internet friend I had made. I'd known her for years, and cared for her greatly. I moved out her way, far from home, just to be with her. Due to her circumstances and my own, that relationship lasted less than 3 months before we split and we haven't done more than write emails to each other every few months since. She went from a daily conversation, voice/video calls, and gaming... to a very sporadic pen pal, in 3 months. She's found new relationships, and fixed much of her life issues, and is in a very happy place now with a girlfriend . I'm still struggling.\n\nI found a new place on Reddit to hang out for a bit, and gained another female friend. I swore I wouldn't fall for her, but I did. I came to care for her just as much, and spend a lot of time talking to her. But she also prefers women, and has friends and relationships she keeps separate from me. I chat with her every day, because without her I'd be alone. She at least cares enough to keep talking to me.\n\nAfter that, I realized both of them gained their other friends by their abilities. They're incredibly creative people, and the things they make draw a lot of attention that gained them friends. So I set about trying to do what I could. I tried to draw and make art, but I failed. I tried to make music of my own, but I failed. I tried to play games, but I'm really bad at them. I tried to make videos, but I'm not very confident. I tried to write stories, but I can't write very much. I realized I was just useless. The only common thing is that people like to talk to me. They're glad I can listen, and have compassion. But going around and saying that \"I'm a great listener\" is not enough in this day and age. I'm clean, but not super attractive, and I don't have any skills to make me attractive to others.\n\nI tried to get Tinder and Bumble, but this has only served to lessen my confidence. From the prettiest girls around to the most homely, I've liked them all just to see. It's been a month, with only two matches, both of which never responded. I feel like I'm mising something. What does it take to make friends anymore? Where do I need to go, what do I need to do? I've forsaken most of what I actually enjoy just to make sure I'm not weird looking or unapproachable.

I really wanted to go so I tried two more times during the next 30 mins but I just couldn't get a word out of my mouth. Feeling really defeated and lonely today :(", "subreddit": "lonely"}

Out of weed. College kids down my street had a pool party today. So that hurt. Privileged fucks get to enjoy their young lives and drive their new Mercedes and BMWs, and use their frat/sorority connections to secure high paying jobs once they graduate, meanwhile down the street I rot in my room. Nah I ain't jealous.\n\nI really don't enjoy the weekend barely at all anymore. By Saturday morning I am already dreading Sunday night, and thinking about what a nightmare this life is. I only feel some relief right after I get off work on Friday literally only up until it gets dark, then I remember that people my age are going out with friends while I watch a show or jack off to Honey Select. Oftentimes I feel like weed makes this worse because sometimes it just knocks me out and I wake up and it's dark. Not that I would have done anything fulfilling with that time anyways. I never do anything that makes me feel like I did something afterwards on the weekends. Feels like I didn't even take a break then on to the next work week. Each week I feel more worn down. \n\nI got the last weed I had from a guy I get along with at work. He cheaped me the fuck out. I paid him 40 and he gave me 2.5 grams over the next 3 days. He kept forgetting to bring it all so he'd give me a bit of what he carried on him each day. I measured it each time when I got home and it came out to 2.5 grams in all. Dumbass thinks he can deal drugs without a scale. Whatever, I know he didn't do it maliciously, I just won't buy from him again or hold him to a certain amount. \n\nI took to the streets today to try to score some bud from strangers. Thought it might be a fun thing to do on the weekend in this boring ass piece of shit place I live in. Couldn't work up the courage to ask the frat people. I always expect tall white guys in college, especially a frat to be hostile douchebags. Went to a local university but couldn't find anyone that looked promising. Being there just reminded me of the life I'm missing.\n\nI need to go back to university. I need to get a high paying job. \"Money doesn't buy happiness\" is fucking bullshit. Working 40 hours a week for years and years buys depression. The thing is, university is fucking impossible, and I don't feel like I can do anything. I have zero confidence in my ability to do school after I struggled in the little time I was in university and got kicked out for being a social retard. Figuring out what to go into is also impossible. I am the most indecisive person on planet Earth.\n\nI'm not creative enough to be any type of artist. I hate math so finance/business are out. I don't give a shit about science. I took an html class in high school. It was impossible to pay attention and I struggled horribly before switching out of it when I could, so I think technology is off the table as well. My sister is in nursing school. She suggested I do it. Says I'm better at school stuff than her and she is making it through. Nurse practitioners make bank. She actually wrote out this whole plan for me and I was excited for a while, but now I'm not. A profession that requires me to be a comforting presence to someone sounds like hell. I can barely even talk to a person. I'm too embarrassed to hug my own mother or tell her I love her even if we're the only ones watching. I can't be a fucking nurse.

Money, religion/spirituality, and love are common motivators throughout the human experience. I've also read that \"being happy\" is the ultimate goal for most people, but what makes me happy?

I crave meaningful social stimulation and the feeling of being valued, but not the inherent discomfort both of these things cause me.\n\nMy self-esteem is garbage, most likely due to my reluctance to open up socially because of traumatic social experiences when I was younger. Even now, going to social events puts a serious strain on me and afterwards severe depression often creeps back.

Sitting alone on a Saturday night in my small apartment at 32 years old, with no job prospects, no driver's licence, no good income, graying hair and face and back acne, along with damaged eyes (long story, basically had a freak accident with a contact lenses 12 years ago and since then my eyes have been constantly bloodshot to varying but often extreme degrees). I have friends, I've always had friends, but never a romantic interest from anyone apart from when I was 10 years old in 4th grade.\n\nWhat's the point? I've been physically fit enough to run a semi marathon in around 2 hours. I speak four languages. I have a master's degree from a university. I've been a fairly competent bass player for over 20 years. I've never had any issues speaking to women. I've tried so many times to change my life and myself (the usual normie advice), all for nothing. Stuck at a dead end job (believe me, I've tried to get somewhere, but after literally hundreds of applications without a single interview I've stopped caring). \n\nWhat's the point of my accomplishments when I have nobody to share them with?! There is none. Self improvement doesn't mean a thing when nobody cares in the first place whether or not you improve.", "subreddit": "ForeverAlone"}

I'm a 21, almost 22, heterosexual male that has the highest degree of clinical depression, general anxiety, and social anxiety. I am more then lonely. \n\nAs a sense of background context I started isolating myself majorly after my parents split up at the end of middle school, start of high school. I had a few friends, but as time went on I lost more and more. Most of my old \"friends\" are either acquaintances or less. It was very hard for me to get through school. I graduated at 19, failing a couple years. Though I took the easy way out via an adult high school diploma. Which basically meant I could graduate with fewer credits than normal. Though I was bright enough where the years I only missed about 60 total days I still passed, even with honors. The years I failed I attended even less.\n\nNow though, I'm going on my third gap year. I'm lost, not really knowing what to do. I was going to attend post secondary this fall, but decided against it to focus on my mental health. It's so bad, I've only had three jobs since graduation. Two call centers which I lasted a month at both and quit, as well as my local community store which I lasted a single day. One of my councilors even said that if I couldn't correct my behavior, I should be institutionalized.\n\nMy self esteem and self worth is near none.

I have no real idea who I am, though I do... I'm a very intelligent person that wastes his potential is how my family describes me. My only solace is anime, manga, and video games. Though I very do much enjoy chess and creative writing whenever I put in time to do them. All I do know is that... I NEED someone. My significant other, my better half.

I'm 18 and right now I have no social life, no friends, no girlfriend, nothing.\n\nIn seventh grade I was a troublemaker and I'd get suspended a lot for the dumbest things like getting in small fights and being disrespectful in class. I also had really bad grades so that didn't help my case. My mom had enough and by the time I was supposed to be in eighth grade she signed me up for online school with the promise that it would only be for a year. Now, I didn't really mind this since hey I'd get sleep in and not wake up early anymore but she took it to a extreme. She didn't allow me to go out on my own or even hang out with my old friends. I think she let me once but I had to practically beg her on my hands and knees and I was only able to go with the condition that she was present at all times. Wanting to spare myself from embarrassment I never asked her again. \n\nA year goes by and i'm still in the online school. I didn't do so well academically and she decided i'll be staying indefinitely.  I ask for tutors and such but she claims I don't need one. My friends on occasion call and ask if I'm doing alright and how much they want me to come back. Even a girl I used to really be into calls me and asks when I'm coming back. Then another year goes by and I'm getting less and less calls. Soon by the time i'm in 10th grade I get no calls. My friends moved on and the loneliness gets to me and I just stop caring about school and my life in general. I eventually fail 11th grade and get held back. \n\nBy some miracle the teachers at my online school offer me a second chance and let me take credit recovery courses alongside 12th grade courses.  Here I am now nearing the end of the school year and I have great grades now and have a real shot at graduating but I'm still lonely and have been recently plagued by dreams of my years in middle school surrounded by old friends and its driving me crazy.

Was able to transfer and keep my same retail store manager job and move into an apartment we found together for her to live in until I could move. Lots of bad stuff happened and I found out some depressing stuff she had done that I dont feel like getting into but it really set the tone for me and f***ed my mental health that I had FINALLY gotten some control over.\n\nI have no friends here. Im completely socially isolated and havent interacted with a SINGLE person that isnt my SO, beyond customer/employee interactions, in 7 months.\nI took over a store that was in the shitter and has required/is requiring SO much work to turn around. I used to have 4-5 employees, and they were around my age so I had work \"friends\", now I have 2 employees who are 40+. \nI live in an apartment with super finicky neighbors so I can't play guitar (one of the biggest motivating and mood lifting things I would do before); I played through headphones for a bit but its not the same or invigorating - just frustrating and depressing that I can no longer record covers of songs or get the right tone. PLUS, I had finally cobbled together a band with an old best friend I had reconnected with before moving, and had something to work towards.\nI used to enjoy video games and would play online with friends decently often - now I cant afford any games that come out (even waiting until they're used) that my \"friends\" now play and have replayed what I own over and over.\n\nI'm BEYOND broke, my (now) fiance pays more of the bills than I do because she's working in an actual career, having just graduated college (which is why i was the one to move). I cant afford to treat myself to fast food, new games, cheap guitar stuff to try and regain interest, etc., and after budgeting (due to credit card debt from my ex of 5 years) it looks like none of that will change for a couple years at least.\n\nMy mental health has tanked, despite staying on top of seeing my psychiatrist to get a higher dose of antidepressants/my meds and regularly seeing a decent therapist (including couples therapy). \nMy job has gotten more stressful and the standards are higher and harder company wide, while this new store is incredibly difficult to improve (which means the $600-$1000 bonus I used to get every 3 months, I no longer get). \nI work 6-7 days a week, and my single day off isnt consistent (which means sometimes I work 10/11 days in a row) and my store hours mean I'm not home until just late enough to have taken up my evening. \n\nI've gotten desperate enough to try meetup and other \"find a group\" sites, I've looked for support groups for my ADHD, bipolar, etc. and asked my therapist if he could find any around here (he embarrassingly came back and said he couldn't either) to connect with people, I've tried \"find musicians\" apps and sites, I've gone to local tabletop game stores/music stores and nobody seems to want to hold a conversation because they're all cliqued up.......and honestly?

But, why is it so hard for me to acknowledge that I do have value and worth, and that I can have confidence I'm okay? Why do I always give other people the benefit of the doubt any time it comes to what they think and say about who I am? Why do I feel like I need a woman in my life to validate me? Why do I care so much about what other people think of me? Why has my entire life been driven by a strong desire to be approved by others but never by my own self? Why am I so hard on myself when I don't get the validation I am looking for? Why do I mentally (and sometimes physically) abuse myself over some of the smallest and insignificant mistakes? How is it that some people are able to not care what others think, even to a fault?  Why do I look down upon myself as being dumb and ugly? Where can I get that hefty dose of confidence everyone says I should have when I feel like in order for me to have this abstract sense of self confidence I must be perfect at pretty much everything, or at least suck less than I succeed? I'm tired of putting myself down. I have enough people besides myself that are more than willing to do that, so why can't I be my own best friend? Why do I always believe I am the liar any time I try to convince myself I'm not this no good for nothing schlub I expect others to see in me? I want to believe in myself and not care about what anyone else thinks that are not very important in my life.  Maybe then I can be truly happy.", "subreddit": "ForeverAlone"}

I'd imagine setting off with her to find adventure in the forests and mountains beyond our home.\n\nLater on, when I had the means to afford it, I ordered a silicone love doll, and she's given me another way of delving into escapism, particularly into a world where I have a girlfriend. I can sit on the couch with her cuddled up against me, and, though it can't compare to the the real thing, it's still incredible to feel the sensation of another body against yours, to be able to caress her thigh, to run your fingers through her hair, and then to pull her in just a bit closer. \n\nDo any of you cope by just temporarily removing yourselves from the real world?

I want a relationship really badly but at the same time i wanna be alone.

But on the other hand i feel like beacuse im so picky i'll be alone for the rest of my life.\nDoes anyone have some advice for me? Any kind of advice?\nP.s. i dont go out much cuz i live in a city where nothing happens. No parties and nothing fun to do. I have to go with a train 2hours to another town if i wanna party. But i dont do that cuz \n#1 i have noone to go with\n#2 i watched too many crime related stuff on tv and youtube and to be completly honest im tooo scared to go anywhere alone cuz u never know who can hurt you or drug you or anything.\n\nBut i can tell a little story of this saturdays events:\n\nOn saturday i actually went out with one of my guy friends i havent seen in a while and we dont talk much but he said if i wanna go party with him. So when we got into town we found a pub with bager music.. he was my wingman even tho he just sat there cuz he was tired.. i went on the dance floor and everything. Danced with some guys. But there was this older dude idk around 35yo he consantly was trying to cop a field.. rubbing his dick on my ass and his hand was either on my boobs or my vage. I expressed i didmt wanna dance with him or anything. Thank god some other guy told him to stop. Cuz 5 mins before that he waited for me at the bathroom blocked the entrace so i couldnt go away and he wanted to kiss me.. i ran out like usain bolt and stuck by my friend the entire nigh. \nSo my paranoid little ass aint goin to parties anymore.\n\nP.p.s\nIm sorry for the long story.

The only close friend that went was the same one that brought her boyfriend with her. I kind of started panicking when i realized that i didn't know that many people but faced it as a challege and told myself \"you're gonna make lots of friends there\".\n I've always struggled with that. Have no problems talking to people and can actually keep a good conversation but I can never get to the friendship itself. it's always so superficial and it never goes deeper than some short interactions, probably because i overthink too much and can't be spontaneous.\n It was going relatively well at first since I had already talked a fair bit to a reasonable amount of people I didn't know but soon I realized that I was lonely. I started realizing that not a single person there cared about me being there or not. They had their groups of friends, their inside jokes and there I was, that couldn't get close to no one. No one would notice if I starved to death, if I did this or that. I kept telling myself \"don't be like this, you're better than that\" and tried to enjoy the beautiful country I was visiting which I did but things are so much better if you actually have someone that remembers about your existence.\n I started thinking that it's this that keeps happening pretty much all the time, no one caring about me and me feeling lonely because of that, but I have my home and my family that make me keep going and make me feel loved, although I didn't realize that. So when I feel horrible because of that I get home and I'm suddenly fine. But there I didnt have anyone or anything, only a filthy room that I had to share with 3 more people that didn't care. This helped me understand how important love is and particularly my family's. \n This trip also helped me opening my eyes, because one of the people I thought that cared about me would completely ignore me most of the times. I understand she wanted to spend time with her boyfriend but there were so many couples there that talked to their other friends. And it makes me sad she didn't even try to reach me.\n I just want to make some friends this year that I'm (hopefully) attending college.

I have a very few friends in my real life but I want online friends to talk about anything. Because I'm a hyper sensitive person, I'm easily hurt by people I know in the real world whether they intend or not. I've no control over my emotions and anyone can hurt me. That's why I try to stay away from people which brings me here, to you. \n\nAbout me: As mentioned, I'm a Hyper Sensitive Person and also an INFP. I suffer from anxiety and depression. I'm extremely introverted and I like reading, writing, studying. I'm interested in science &amp; maths although I don't have vast knowledge about these but I try to learn as much as I can. \n\nI love to play table tennis, badminton, video game. I also like travelling a lot. That's my only goal in life. To travel a lot and meet a lot new people, live with them, know their culture. One of the reasons I want to have online friends is because I want to know different cultures. \n\nI also love to watch movies and TV shows. I'm a Marvel fan (a big fan of Captain America). I'm also a fan of Game of Thrones, The Big Bang Theory and a lot other shows. My favourite movies are The Greatest Showman, The Curious Case Of Benjamin Button, The Imitation Game and many more. \n\nAnd the most important thing: I'm alive and in sanity because of music. My life without music would be a mistake and impossible. The only way to not feel depressed is music. My anxiety and stress reliever is music. I basically live on food, air and music. \n\nAlso I love dance. \n\nAnd I'm willing to try out almost everything &amp; anything. We can talk about games, universe, puzzles and quizzes and anything you want to. \n\nThere are a lot of things I want to talk about and willing to know. I don't use discord but we can talk on Reddit, Instagram, Facebook, WhatsApp, Google Hangout , Skype.", "subreddit": "lonely"}

Not sure where to go. Sorry for the way that I am writing this, it's going to be more of a thought stream.\n\nIm not happy and Im not sure if I would necessarily label myself as depressed, but I do go through episodes of depression. My biggest issue right now that has more recently begun to seriously affect me is that i have a hard time connecting with other people and i have no friends.\n\nIll be more specific; i have one friend who I'm not always sure i even like very much but i keep him around even if at arms length because he is my one friend. He's been my friend for many years. I am 26 now and have known him since i was maybe 13. It may seem that I am alienating myself from the way i just described this friendship so ill go into some detail. I love him as a friend, care about him, and have found myself there to help him when he's seriously needed me. That said in short he's just a strange person. His strangeness never really was an issue to me until one night when we both tripped on acid together and things got very weird. I don't want to go into much detail as this isn't the point of the post but just to put things into context ill say that he was the aggressor in my bad trip where although nothing physically happened there was this rapey/dominating energy being imposed onto me and the whole thing really opened my eyes about the weird way that he views our relationship. Im trying to move past it but i don't think i can. He still makes me uncomfortable especially when i analyze his words and actions against the deeper parts of him i saw that night.\n\nI have another group of \"friends\" who are really like music festival friends essentially. We get along. They invite me out and I appreciate it dearly. I love them as people. But I still feel so alone when Im with them. I feel like I have nothing to talk about with them usually. Theres nothing to connect over except music it seems. Which although music is something I'm dearly passionate about, the areas that we have overlapping taste is a mere fraction of the stuff that Im into. I usually always have a good time with them and i value them greatly, but they also live 2.5 hours away so i don't tend to see them much.\n\nI guess Ill tell you guys a bit about myself, I'm going to try and be as honest as I can but I'm sure there will be some bias. Im male, 26. Ive lived on my own since I was 18. I am decently smart I guess. I don't usually feel particularly intelligent but at work I'm assured fairly often that I am. I did graduate college with an associates degree suma cum laude with a gpa of around 3.93. To be fair it wasn't a particularly good college, but good enough I suppose to be considered an accredited university. Im decently attractive, but I guess it depends on who you'd ask. 5'11, 165 lbs. I have a good job, decent car, I make good money particularly for my age. On paper there's not much wrong with me. I do go to therapy every week. I have of course explained all this to my therapist, and he believes that my biggest issue is that i can't connect with people my age because of my maturity level (when it comes to having my shit together because I am definitely not \"mature\") and because my biggest interests are more intellectual or something.\n\nMy interests and hobbies:\n\nlistening to music and going to shows and festivals, I do this very often. Maybe four to six festivals a year of different sizes. Shows oftentimes every other weekend. When Im home I play video games, I read sometimes, I am learning the guitar, I go to the gym about three days a week and weight train, i enjoy learning and am very interested in psychology and philosophy. I also take drugs recreationally. Primarily psychedelics. No opiates, no cigarettes, no uppers. No prescription meds. I think about many things through that lens (not many people do I guess)\n\nAt work I am well liked. Before anyone offers the suggestion that I should befriend my colleagues, Ill mention that I work in a different state than i live. There is also a huge age gap between myself and my colleagues. One of at least 10 years. My last job had some guy my age and we've been out a good handful of times. But they usually go out without me. When asking my closest friend of that group if there was a reason during a particularly honest conversation, he didn't have one.\n\nWhen I go out, I can usually strike up a conversation with anyone. Im not particularly shy unless we're talking about a pretty girl in which case I crumble. But it's not even pretty girls that I am really after, Im dying for a \"bro\" that's just down to grab beers and play couch co op. Those conversations I do strike up, I have a hard time bridging the gap between acquaintance and friend.\n\nSpeaking of pretty girls, I do have a tinder. Im pretty successful I would say. I have well over 1000 matches now and comparing that to my other male friends who use tinder i believe that's a lot for a male. I don't really use it to get laid, and if that's specifically what i was after i feel like id be able to get it easily enough. but actually meeting someone and connecting with them and vibing with them is soooooo much more appealing to me. that said, I just have such a hard time finding someone that resonates with me the way i crave. and the last two dates i went on where i was interested in the other person, they really didn't seem very interested in me. So again, finding worthwhile companionship on this front has been very difficult for me too.\n\nI guess none of this has really been about ME though so let me attempt to describe myself. I would say I have a good heart. I can be selfish, though I really make attempts to check myself so that I am not acting on anyone else's expense. Im sarcastic, a little cynical maybe, though I care deeply about humanity. Cute animals will have me making the least masculine noises you can think of. if the right song is playing at sunset, i might start crying overtaken by the beauty of it all. I regularly help strangers, give homeless change, etc. I've donated to vetted causes when i had the funds. When i have the money, ill just buy people shit. Like if I wanna invite someone to a show and they don't have the money, ill just take them. Ive paid for damn near 1000$ in tickets for festivals and shows for other people over the years and never wanted anything more than company in return. If you're beating me in a game, ill talk shit the whole way down. I have like an ironic confidence because I'm also the most well versed in self deprecating humor. I try to stay humble. I am grateful for everything good in my life, and often remind myself to be thankful for the experiences I'm having and the things i have. I remind myself often that despite my suffering I am incredibly fortunate in many domains. I don't really know what else to say.\n\nI know this whole post is all over the place. I don't know what to say. Im just spilling all of this in the hopes that someone can give me some insight or if someone can get an impression from what I'm saying here what my problem might be. For the most part as far as i know people seem to share the same nice opinions about me; smart, good looking, cool, chill, etc etc but if all that crap is true, then why do i feel so alone? I have the suspicion that people just aren't being \"real\" with me. because if they are, then Im not sure if i would be going through all this. this isn't a humble brag this is a call for help", "subreddit": "lonely"}

I just turned 20 and for the last few years I've been thinking a lot about my childhood. My life was incredible as a kid. I grew up in a city with everything a child could ever want and I lived in a housing complex full of kids my age. It was the last time I had meaningful friendships in my life. Every friendship since then has felt artificial in comparison. We had our own playground and lots of pathways between houses and alleyways where we could play all kinds of exciting games. School was completely stress free and consisted of goofing off and having fun and I never had tests or homework to worry about. I would wake up every day ecstatic about the day to come and practically run out the door. \n\nI miss the pure wonder and joy that engulfed my life at that point. I don't know why everyone my age enjoys having responsibilities so much. The best times of my life where when I had nothing to worry about. I didn't know what a \"job\" was or even knew about the concept of death. All I knew was how soon the ice cream truck would be driving by my house or when it would be warm enough to set up the outdoor pool. Every day was like an exciting adventure that I was the protagonist in. \n\nChildhood to me was how I imagine powerful drugs would feel. All my senses were boosted and everything seemed \"cool\" and interesting. The bus stop wasn't just a bus stop and the mall wasn't just a mall. I actually grew up near the 2nd biggest mall in my country and I have so many memories of exploring it as a child. Stopping in a Toys R Us was like winning the lottery and being allowed to pick a toy was like a dream come true. I could go on for days but what I'm trying to say is childhood for me was an incredible experience. I have all kinds of extremely intense nostalgia for those times and I still sometimes visit the place I grew up. If I could sacrifice the rest of my life to relive my childhood I would. No loneliness, stress, or anxiety. Just pure unadulterated fun. \n\ntd;dr - I had an incredible childhood and I can't stop thinking about it. I miss the times when I had almost zero responsibilities and true friendships. I would give anything to relieve those years of my life.  \n\nThanks for reading!", "subreddit": "lonely"}

Hence, my parents decided that my mother and I would come to live in the city because otherwise my education suffers.   \n\nThis guy, the guy I met today, we last met before I came to live in the city. It's been around 13-14 years (I'm 18 now). He was my first friend in the world. Hell we even bathed together.   \n\nAnd it was such a chance meeting. I'm a author in progress an posted an article which I gave as a story on Instagram. One of my other friends gave it as his story, and this guy, my old friend, he saw it on his profile. But at the same time it feels like destiny too cause their is an entrance exam for a particular college which is coming up, and different people have exams on different dates and shifts, and both of us have the exams on the same day and time, so even if we hadn't met today we would've definitely met on that day.   \n\nAnd man it feels so good meeting someone who is as excited to see me as I am to see them. I tend to be a little clingy and the only person I was really comfortable with doing that was my ex, who was fine with it but later told me that's part of the reason why she broke up. Anyway, point is that left me really shattered but this guy, this son of a gun with whom I used to have chocolate cigarettes and smoked real cigarettes today, this son of a b***h is as excited to see me if not more. Man I'm just so damn happy and high on life today.    \n\nI'm sorry for the long post but again, thanks for reading.

That shit about love/kissing/relationship being overrated is BULLSHIT. Like it felt so nice and good. And yes as I said she wasn't really crazy about me, it lasted short and we didn't have sex, but having someone, kissing them, good morning/night texts, thinking about them, hugs... It felt amazing. Don't believe when people tell you its overrated! Now when I have experienced it  I'm kinda torn. In one hand at least I finally experienced something in my life. On the other hand now when I know what it feels like I want it again. And after trying so hard and failing the last few months I see that I belong here on this subreddit...

I haven't experienced all the \"life-essential\" moments that almost everyone my age has gone through. I've never had lasting friends who keep in touch, never mind a romantic partner.\n\nWhile I barely leave my house, on my long commutes to school I get to see the outside people. Everyone has something going on for them, everyone is perfect. The guys all have their hip hairstyles, the girls all wear the same fucking white Adidas trainers with three stripes. By now I've become so toxic that I actually despise normal people.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhere are all the other lonely defective people? Are we really that much of a minority? Or am I the minority of a minority?\n\nI don't mean this as a self-pity kind of thing, but I've come to the realization that even most other FA are better people than me. Some of you have money, others are actually socially capable, and some are even intelligent and perhaps attractive. Some of you have friends, while who I call my \"best (and only) friend\" is a person I only talk to every few months. Had I never met that person, I don't know what would keep me away from total insanity.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI tried to join the ForeverAlone discord channel, but I couldn't even begin to talk. It's crushing recognizing people who post in this very subreddit by their username, and then realizing that they actually can work their way around a live conversation. I mentally shut down during live conversations, and now avoid them both IRL and online.\n\nThe worst was visiting the \"ForeverAloneDating\" subreddit. While that place is meant for FAs such as myself, most of the people posting there are what I would call \"normal\" from what they describe in their posts. If I can't compete with other FAs who are supposed to be the minority, how could I with the majority?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe biggest problem with all this is that I don't see any way to fix the way I am. Growing up most of my life from my bedroom has made me a fundamentally damaged person, and not only I don't know how to fix it, I don't think I even want to get healed. Being broken is now part of me and if I fix the brokenness, nothing else remains.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBut I'm worried that this is an endless cycle. The fact that I'm lonely makes me avoid more people, adding to the loneliness problem even further. A cycle that will only end either by a miracle, or when I reach my last day.\n\nA few days ago I watched a documentary about the Japanese hikikomori. It was like seeing a prophecy of my own future: dying alone in their room and having people scoop up forgotten remains after weeks of decomposing away on the floor.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThere is no meaning to unobserved life. You could cure cancer, create the most beautiful artwork, and build a rocket to the moon, but if there is no one to share the experience with, its meaning sums to nothing.\n\nLiving as FA is meaningless.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhat's the point in living a meaningless life?", "subreddit": "ForeverAlone"}

He's also a bum with no job because he ends up leaving only a few months after getting a new one, so he mooches off my poor grandfather. We live (well, I go back and forth on a divorce schedule, but you get the point) in a two story house, each floor being an apartment.

A few years back when I was maybe twelve or thirteen, my dad outright screamed at him for God-knows-what-reason for what seemed like hours. And the abuse goes past my poor grandfather. He verbally abused my older brother and I. He always yells at me and complains when I act openly depressing, because I'm goddamn depressed and suicidal, and despite knowing I'm depressed  (but not knowing I'm suicidal), he still treats me like shit for it.

He kept yelling at her to get off the chair in front of my brother and I, but she was too afraid to move. After a few seconds, he picked up a curtain rod, one with a big metal ball on the end of it about the size of a marble (or bigger), and he whacked her thigh with it. Over. And over. And over. She yelped in pain as he did, him hitting harder and yelling at her to get off louder and louder. Eventually, my brother and I stepped in and goddamn yelled at the guy, basically telling him to piss off. He got mad at us for defending the dog, and stormed out of the house. He doesn't hit her as much or as hard anymore, just taps on the snout, but he still unjustifyingly puts her in her cage and yells at her. He does it if she follows him, if he's cooking and she stares at him, when she stares at him in general, whenever she wanders and doesn't lay down, whenever she licks the kitchen floor, and more. She gets yelled at and put in her cage for no good reasons. She's such a sweetheart, too. She almost always listens, she's never went to the bathroom in the house, and she's always nice.

So here I am,  Every night sitting at home watching TV or you tube with no one to talk to, I have tried facebook,  Tinder etc with no joy.  I feel so isolated that at night I hug a pillow just to feel anything next to me as I fall asleep.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI work in retail,  My daily conversations with customers are very very limited,  mainly around weather or products.  Very rarely do they become personal and never to the point where I would consider them friends.   Today I must have spoken to about 30 people,  None of them talk about much more than the weather,  or have you got this item.  I get it though  as a customer you don't really want to get to know the members of staff in a store,  you want your goods and you want to get on with your life.   I hold no grudges over this.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFrom time to time I do have volunteers (I work for a charity) that help out around the store,  but they are either much older or much younger and have nothing in common with me,  or they have severe learning difficulties making conversation and building friendship next to impossible.  It is safe to say that I might speak to one person on a personal level a week about how my life is going,  that is my elderly mother who I shield as much as possible from my plight as I don't want to worry her more than she already does.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nRecently we have had a person placed with us from the courts for punishment.  They are bright, very intelligent, a similar age and due to their own circumstances also only have a very small circle of friends,  and whilst she has her own battles, we hit it off almost immediately. Quickly exchanging numbers and would talk most night's into the evening using whatsapp,  She would talk about how her life has been destroyed by her ex husband, battles with alcohol and loosing her career.  I would talk about how my life had spiraled out of control due to depression and anxiety.  Turned out we have a great deal in common and a friendship was actually starting to form.  Nothing romantic due to her very recent divorce and my anxiousness around meeting new people.  It was however something nice;  I use the wording \"Was\" quite deliberately.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nDue to the nature of her being with us as a punishment I had no option to inform my manager that we had been talking in the evenings,  It was then that **EVERYTHING** changed.  The manager told me that it was inappropriate and that she was probably manipulating me (she has never asked for anything or any special treatment and knows that I would not give her any anyway)  The manager also demanded to see my phone to see the conversations.  I refused this as it is none of her business,  not being done on company phones and not during company time so has zero rights to see my phone, manager was not happy but could not do anything about it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe manager did however get to see the conversations on the other persons phone (she is terrified of the manager), I know this for a fact as The manager demanded that all communications stop immediately, they even mentioned that they didn't know how lonely and isolated I felt, but the friendship had to end as \"They are playing you\" \"you are being manipulated\", her battle with alcohol rehab (something she had only told me in confidence) and other such comments (including threats against my job),     This has pretty much destroyed me as I had shared some of my deepest feelings of loneliness, isolation and feeling numb, and she had shared some of the hell she had been through.  Both of us believing that it would be for us alone, yet the manager knows it all.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI have not been able to speak to her due to schedules being arranged so we are apart in work,  and fear that the manager will once again phone check her for messages and calls.  So once again I am left alone,  no one to confide in,  no one to talk to about stupid TV shows,  no one.  I am scared to contact her,  and I have heard that she is reluctant to get in touch with me until she finishes the time left she has with us (months at the least).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo now I find myself alone again,  and it is even worse than before.   Before I could deal with it,  but now it is an all pervasive feeling,  and I can recognize the old familiar feelings of depression setting in.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEdit - Spelling.", "subreddit": "lonely"}

I thought about the deep, profound connection that storybook and major motion picture romances were made of, and I would hope that I could one day partake in such a joyous union. Then I realized it best to dial things back a little.\n\nNext I hoped for \u201cDesire\u201d. I'm sure some women have seen the hunger I have in my eyes when looking at them. It's not really lust, but more the wish of wanting to know more. It's like curiosity run amok. \u201cWhat does she eat? What does her hair smell like? Does she laugh at the same things I do?\u201d I yearned for someone to look at me with that same desire, that same wish of knowing more. Is that happening? Nope.\n\nWell... I guess I have to pare down what I want. What is below \u201cDesire\u201d? Let's say \u201cInterest\u201d. It's not an outright hunger, but there isn't a dismissal of a relationship blossoming. It's a woman saying, \u201cHmmm... maybe this is someone I could possibly be interested in pursuing romantic relations with. Let me find out a little more about him.\u201d I think all the talk of self-improvement, getting hobbies, having stuff to say, is about the chance of making \u201cInterest\u201d bloom into something more. The flaw with all the talk about self-improvement is that there must be a little spark of \u201cInterest\u201d to begin. It there is no interest in finding out more, the depth of character that hobbies and experience is supposed to highlight will never be seen.\n\nI can't get \u201cLove\u201d.

I'm sure it popped up on a certain board that talks badly about women but in my case, I don't want to say that about women. I just want to show that being short does make it more difficult to date. If someone finds it, please post it. \n\nMost of the chart I didn't pay much attention to until it used a guy who is exactly my height as an example. It then said what percentage of women who were of a particular height said his height would be a deal breaker before knowing anything else about him. Because it used my exact height, it got to me. It also showed my point about how being my height which isn't even that short while not a cause of FA, can cause me to have a far smaller dating pool than a guy who is six feet tall. \n\nIt started that at my height, half of all women who were 5'1\" would date someone my height. It quickly went down. By the time it came to women taller than me it was below 5%. I know these types of studies can not be accurate but it would make sense. It said that only a third of the women in the dating pool would date a guy my height before she knew anything else about him. If my height alone was a deal breaker for two thirds of all women, what about the third who wouldn't see it as a deal breaker? My being unattractive and socially awkward(autistic) didn't help. \n\nIn this rant, I'm just trying to say, while height alone usually won't cause someone to be FA, combined with other negatives like being unattractive and having low social status, it does make being FA far more likely than if they were 6 feet tall. \n\nI do want to say that I know 5'7\" isn't that short and there are posters here who are much shorter than me. I'm sure if my dating pool of women when I used dating sites was only a third, theirs must be very small. I feel for those guys. Some do have success due to their positives outside of their height. Some get lucky and that can't be measured. \n\nI also wanted to say I'm not saying taller guys can't be FA. If you are 6'1\", you can still be FA if you have problems in other areas. \n\nIt's just when I saw this data it said to me, this is part of why you are FA. That triple negative of short, unattractive, and autistic is a way to become FA. Obviously someone can be all three but not be FA. I wonder how many other guys are FA because they also have that triple negative. I hope people don't think I'm saying anything bad about women. This is just reality with dating. I will never say a negative thing about a woman who says she prefers taller guys. It's natural.", "subreddit": "ForeverAlone"}

Just let me explain.\n\nSo basically I'm just living a normal life, as someone would say. I have some friends, but I don't feel emotionally connected to them. In different social situations I've used to fake confidence and use humor to hide my shyness or awkwardness and now it works pretty well on the outside. \n\nBut on the other hand, this doesn't mean that I precept myself as a confident person. I often overthink stuff and/or take something more seriously than it should be.\n\nOn the outside I'm chill and nice, in the inside I'm screaming and crying. I mean the latter literary - when I come home sometimes it becomes so lonely and miserable that I just break down, lay on the floor and cry.\n\nI have some hobbies like music and photography, but no one seems to be really interested in what I do, so I just drag this things through my life hoping that someone will once appreciate it.\n\nIt wouldn't be even a problem for me to find a gf if I really put some effort into it, but I don't feel that it has some sense for me. I will feel lonely anyway.\n\nBack to the topic of this post, I understand that mental disorders is VERY serious issue and many people would be happy to get rid of it. I understand that it's like living in hell, but I'm already there, just the other part of it. And if I was a psychopath, at least I wouldn't feel the need to connect with other people or feel that someone needs me etc.\n\nI just want to stop caring about everything and don't be lying coward anymore. I don't want to give a fuck about every single thing in this world, don't feel anything, not even a glimpse of emotions and just do stuff like a machine.\n\nOr if I had depression (the real one, not self diagnosed shit), it would kind of add some meaning to my life, because I would at least have a goal to overcome it.\n\nAnyway, I'm probably just a moron who underestimates the mental issues", "subreddit": "ForeverAlone"}

For some of us, it wasn't just one rejection or one bad experience. It wasn't 10 rejections or bad experiences. It wasn't 100 rejections or bad experiences that cause us to think this way. In some cases it's hundreds of rejections and bad experiences that causes us to think that we are inferior as people. \n\nSome non-FA'ers don't understand what hundreds of rejections can do to someone without any successes to balance them out. They think because they have been rejected along with some successes or even a few successes that they know what it's like to be rejected like some of us have. Personally I've been rejected hundreds of times and have had hundreds of bad experiences. It's easy to tell someone to not to listen to what a person says when they say you are ugly but when every single experience tells you that you are ugly, you are going to start to believe you are. \n\nPeople tell us we need confidence when confidence with socializing comes from success. If you shoot a basketball one time and miss, you will still have some confidence you could make the next shot. If you miss 10 times you will start to doubt yourself. If you miss 500 shots without making a single shot and before you take your 501st shot you say that you don't think you will make it, you are making a reasonable assumption. Some person walks up to you and says in order to make that 501st shot, you need to be confident in yourself. You need to take 20 showers while on a treadmill while lifting while getting a haircut while getting therapy while buying new outfits while joining hobby groups while volunteering, you will make the 501st shot. Another person tells you to fake the confidence that you will make the 501st shot. In reality, you know you are going to miss the 501st shot. Then you miss it and suddenly people surround you telling you that you missed because you didn't try hard enough or were using the wrong ball. \n\nNon-FA'ers don't understand what it's like to get rejected every single time. It destroys your self-esteem. They tell us to brush it off when it's impossible. Some of them are ex-FA'ers who got lucky and escaped FA but they will try to justify them escaping by saying it was because they did all of these things to escape. I don't think most non-FA'ers know what 100% rejection can do to someone when it happens so many times.", "subreddit": "ForeverAlone"}

Of course partially due to simple laziness, but I was on the verge of just giving up, because \"what's the point of it all\"? But my survival instinct told me \"you don't want to repeat this subject, do you?\", so I carried on and coded it.\n\nI have max score from that task. Even more frustrating. Why? Because it tells me that if I want, I can succeed at other fields of life. But I don't really want to succeed at them anymore, because there's no point if I don't have anyone to share my life with. Currently I'm looking for the IT internship. And I should probably be scared of job interviews, tests and all the bureaucracy that comes with job applying. And I was. But now I'm not afraid that much, which is really odd for me. I mean, sure, attempting an interview will make my heart race and cause stress, but it's only a temporary adrenaline rush, not constant fear. All that remains is rage. Still no internship, but right now I don't care about it. I will find it eventually, in fact I'm almost certain I will, but ironically this will make me only more enraged. Only more insane. Why can I success in other aspects of life, but not in this one? I just want someone to hug me when the battle is tough, that's it. I don't care about friends, job, hobbies etc. I just want to have a meaningful relationship with a girl, but can't achieve this. See the great irony? If I work hard enough, I'll achieve a lot in this life. But apparently won't have that one thing I want from the life on this planet and all the other things I could have are in fact things I don't desire that much. This makes me rage over all other parts of life. What's the point? Why have a good job if there will be no wife and kids to support? Why care about a good house while I'll be there on my own?\n\nFor the past week I was also constantly yelling at my mother. Sure, my relationship with her has always been terrible and for years I've been terrorized by her and lived in a constant fear. But right now she actually tries to be nice to me and I really can't blame her. This time the roles were different. This time I was not a victim. I feel terrible with myself. It feels like I'm turning into a zombie. The prolonged sadness and misery caused by loneliness is now evolving into rage, anxiety and anger. I'm scared. I don't want to be aggressive. I would always describe myself as a peaceful being and I'd rather maintain that status. But the zombie virus (read: loneliness) is not curable. I'm afraid I'm about to cross a certain threshold. A threshold after which I'll have to admit I'm too terrible to even try anymore.\n\nI'm scared. I don't want to turn into a zombie. I just want to be peaceful and nice, so at least people around me won't suffer - it's enough that I have to.", "subreddit": "ForeverAlone"}

It just never happened. \nThis had always affected my self esteem A LOT. I thought I must be hideous, annoying, ugly etc because I still did not kiss anyone till I was 21. It made me feel horrible, very unwanted and discarded. Because everyone eventually starts dating, right? \nI did not go on a date until I was 21. I did not get an actual boyfriend until I was 22, same age I had sex for the first time. We dated for about 3 months, until he broke up with me. He broke up with me because he was depressed and did not feel like it was fair to me. I tried to protest this and said I was happy with how I was being treated, but it ended anyways. \n\nPretty soon after that I dated another guy for about 2 months, but he also broke up with me because I guess he realized he didnt actually like me but did not want to break up with me over the holidays? I felt like he just kept me around to have sex with, not because he actually liked me. This made me feel very bad. The day before he broke up with me we had sex and the condom broke so I had to get a Plan B pill on new years eve. The next morning he called me on the phone to break up.\n\nJust last week I had things broken off with me again. This guy was so so promising though. I never felt like I hit it off so good with someone. He was caring and sweet and really seemed like he liked me. I did not feel any pressure or much anxiety around him. It felt good and I was always excited to see him and i would get sad if I didnt get a reply from him for a day and a half. We went out for about a month. We didnt have sex or define the relationship. He said he wasn\u2019t sure if the feelings were there because he said he sometimes feels like he doesn't feel things strongly in general. And his Grandma just died but he said he isnt close to his family. I cannot understand how someone who would say things such as \u201cmy bed smells like you\u201d or \u201ci wish you where here now\u201d would suddenly turn on me. He said he prefers to wait to have sex, which I am fine with, but even when I slept over at his house 3 times he never tried to cup a feel.\nI re loaded dating apps today. I saw his profile on hinge and I am a bit confused, I dont know if its an old profile or if he is looking to string someone else along just to throw them on the side of the road.\n\nI feel consistently abandoned again and again. I dont know if I can handle this. It makes me feel HORRIBLE that I am 23 and I have never had a relationship for more then 3 months. I mean 16 year olds have longer relationships then that. It makes me feel so ugly and unwanted. Like why would anyone EVER want to date some girl who cant keep a guy for more then 12 weeks? \n\nNo one has ever told me they love me in a romantic context.\n\nI feel like no one ever likes me. It makes me feel so empty and depressed inside. It makes me think maybe if you get a nose job, a brow lift, this surgery and that you will be attractive enough to the point where they will not leave you. \n\nI dont know how I can wear my heart on my sleeve again and again if everytime I do someone just leaves me to die and bleed out. \n\nWhy do people leave me? I dont want to be abandoned. Its a constant fear that looms over me. I just feel like such ugly garbage. i am not enough for anyone, no one likes me.

But on more than one occasion in a class, I've thought I'd been making really great headway in making friends with everyone, and then it seems like when you break it down, I'm ALWAYS last choice. I posted the absolute worst example of this a while ago, and it did pretty well as far as posts go, because everyone was probably shocked by how badly I was treated in that situation several years ago.\n\nBut anyway, I'm already getting the impression that this is on the way to happening... AGAIN. \n\nSo I get to class and just me and another girl are there, and she just happens to start talking to me. And we talked about the class, the material, things we understood and what we didn't. Just casual school-related stuff, the norm when you have no idea what else to really talk about.\n\nSo another girl from class came in, and joined in, and things were good. Same with another dude, who I've also spoken to and is a pretty nice guy. So the first girl kind of brings up us studying together outside of class. And I just kind of nod my head and go \"yeah, that might not be a bad idea.\" And the others seemed to not hate the idea either. \n\nBut then during the end of our break, girl 2 starts talking to the other guy, and not only is making conversation, but seems genuinely interested in inquiring about him. Keep in mind she hadn't really said a whole lot to anyone up until this point, except *maybe* girl 1. But whatever.\n\nSo at the end of class, I do end up exchanging numbers with girl 1, and girl 2 exchanges numbers with the other dude, and then both girls go to the bathroom and whatever, and I didn't happen to run into either after that. But I can only assume that the girls also exchanged numbers. So like, I can't say much about the other dude, but I have this weird feeling that if this study group DOES happen, I'm going to be excluded somehow. \n\nAnd I know I'm already overreacting, and I don't know if that's true.

I always end up meeting people, normally tourists and people here on work visas because there are a LOT of them in this city, but it\u2019s not like I end up making meaningful connections with 99% of them, and I have to spend a LOT of my time fending off advances from men who see my little blonde self alone in a bar and circle like vultures.

I'm losing track of basic things, I'm forgetting the things I've done throughout each day. More and more, I find myself in overwhelming disbelief and dissociation with the world. I looked in the mirror this morning and couldn't fathom that the disgusting creature looking back was me. At multiple times during the day, I will forget where I am and what I'm doing. I'll become, for a moment, completely detached from the world. It's like an inverted version of those brief moments of lucidity you sometimes have in your dreams.\n\nThat's what it feels like a lot of the time. Like this is all just a really bad dream. It's so difficult to believe that life can be *this* bad. I just want someone to love me. That's all, and it seems like so little to ask for. It's so common, it's so banal, so everyday. It isn't every day that someone becomes a billionaire, or rises to power, or attains international fame.\n\nBut I don't think a day goes by without one human being loving another human being. Exclusively, romantically, mutually.\n\nThat's my aspiration. That's all I want out of this life. That's all I've ever wanted. But it feels like the one thing I can't get. I've been depressed about this for years, but it feels like it's going to reach its peak soon. I hope I'll kill myself on impulse.\n\nI've been really angry and frustrated about all this. Shouting, throwing things, ugly crying, all that... Sometimes everything feels all too immediate, all too much, all too real.

And I'm never going to get it. I've been trying to improve myself, but I can't outpace this creeping depression no matter how hard I try.

Everything is capital. Everything is a commodity. Everywhere you have to compete. It's one big race and you have to accumulate as much as humainly possible. It doesn't only include money.

I end up writing screeds so I just want to bullet point some of the main parts.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\-When I was 13 I was groomed at raped by an older student in my school. I didn't understand or realise it at the time.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\-When I was 15 I realised what had happened, told a few close friends and became really depressed\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\-Friends became distant, started cutting me off, including my lifelong best friend. I dropped out of school the day I walked in, sat down and a table of over 20 girls all stood up and left. No one would even speak to me, and no one really has again\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\-Despite dropping out and not studying, I sat and passed 3 exams with good grades, went to college, while battling trauma, depression, insomnia, and loneliness from no friends and a young, emotionally abusive boyfriend\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\-I tried to go to therapy, but my GP sent my files to the wrong place 3 times while I attempted suicide on several different occasions, ending in hospital visits. I had therapists stand up and walk out on me, because I was in the wrong age bracket.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\-My emotionally abusive boyfriend constantly argued, put me down and dumped me, then done a 180 apologising to me. I was young, naive and suffering from such loneliness I kept taking him back\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\-I can only assume my old friends spread what I told them about my rape, despite it being told in confidence. I got a message from the person who done it, saying they heard a \"awful rumour\" from an old friend that he had raped me. I ignored it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\- I was on a night out with my boyfriend and his friends.. That night I was uncomfortable because my rapist was there, but my boyfriend refused to leave. Once the guy left, a group of his 20-something friends came over shouting to me, attacked me and threatened to kill me. Did my boyfriend or his friends step in? No. In the days after when the police needed any evidence they could get to charge these people, did any of his friends help me? No. Straight up refusal, even though they witnessed the attack.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\-I reported my rape officially to the police, something I had never wanted to do, but I was now terrified of this man, alone with no friends and felt I needed to do something. I had little control over how this was investigated apart from my statement, and names from the people in my life at that age. I wasn't updated regularly.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\-My boyfriend confessed to me that my old best friend from school, a relation of his, spoke to him in a pub at length about me on a night out. She grabbed him and kissed him twice. It sure hurts when someone you once considered a lifelong friend goes to those lengths to hurt you. Although I was doubtful of this at the time, on another occasion I ran into another one of the people from that group, who confirmed that it happened (and expressed how awful that girl had been - which confused me, as they are close friends, but at this point I hadn't seen them in years)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\-Another girl from my past ran into me on a train, and started shouting at me about \"sending police to her door\". Busy train, in front of so many people, she shouted about the case, how I had no right to \"scare her mother with police at the door\", that I was stupid, etc. She then sat on the phone to her mother for the whole train ride, talking loudly about me, how pathetic/stupid/ignorant etc. I was while I sat mortified on my way to study at university with a student I barely knew. I couldn't understand the hatred she must have had for me, I know if I ever had the police at my door asking for help on a rape case of a girl I went to school with years earlier that I wouldn't be mad at the girl\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\-My rapist was questioned, in jail for a bit, then released. He confessed to what he done, so I was told by the police, but it didn't get through court due to \"not enough evidence\". When I asked the police on this, it was due to what my old friends had said in their statements. These girls were my only friends in school. They knew me, knew the person that raped me, saw me fall into depression and drop out of school. I never knew why they all cut me off. Or why suddenly one day they were writing screeds of hate about me online. Writing horrible comments about me on pictures of us without realising I could see it\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\-I found out I may have Aspergers, asked my psychologist who helped me but cannot confirm. I cannot afford a psychiatrist to confirm for me, but after reading it 100% describes why so much of my life has been a challenge. I struggle to make friends, hold a job, I don't understand social politics and I actually haven't had a friend in so long I have forgotten how to socialise, and before it was already so much of a struggle. I can barely remember friendship yet I long for it so much. It has been 7 years. Everyday I lie in bed and think about how much I want to die, the only thing that stops me is putting my mother, and other family, through any more pain than my unfortunate teenage years already brung\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\-After a relationship of lying, cheating, constantly getting put down and dumped just to be begged back, I finally left my ex. It was a horrible relationship that made the above all so much worse, butI sincerely hope he changes and that his next girlfriend is treated a lot better.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThere are a ton more of these situations I could write here. I do not think I am a perfect person, and I have been mean to people, but it is always in retort to these situations and I tend to cut people off instead of turn every single person against them. I once had to walk out of school through a crowd of people who lined up to chant that I \"took it up the bum\", referring to my rapist, because he told everyone he done that to me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe above has been happening over 7 years. I completely hate myself now. I feel ugly, stupid, unwanted and unloved. I am forever grateful for my family, who took my side and helped me, but I still feel so incredibly alone as I haven't had a proper friend in 7 years.  Everytime I accidently come across photos on social media of the people from my past, all together and still friends, after everyone has been so shit to me, it feels like a stab in the heart. I don't want anything to do with any of these people, but I still feel so pathetic and alone. It's hard to change your mindset of yourself when my main experience of people has been this. I just don't know what to do. I feel like help with aspergers would help me, but I'm stuck behind a paywall and I just don't have the money. I know friends would help, but it's incredibly hard to seem to find people at my current age - I thought it would be easy but everyone already seems to busy with all the friends they've had throughout their life.", "subreddit": "lonely"}

Most of my interactions have been through online dating since I am not in school to meet any girls atm. Getting matches isn't my problem I am not saying that I have hundreds of girls swiping right on me, but if I were to swipe right 100 times on tinder I would get maybe two or three matches. I am pretty okay with that considering that I used to NEVER get any matches and that was discouraging. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnyways, if I do match with a girl and send her a message, 75 percent of the time she won't respond. She easily has hundreds of guys who are much better options than me are who she also matched with. Most girls who do responds never really put any effort into conversations. Sometimes I feel like I am just not interesting to talk to online, and other times they don't really give a shit and waste my time. One of the worst feelings I have had a numerous amount of times through online dating is getting thoughtless responces that has 1-5 words every message. The worst part to me is when I do manage to go on a date. Even then, every single woman has lost interest in me and drags me along as their number 9 or 10 option for example. I hate that more than ghosting. I wish they can tell me they aren't interested in dating me instead of dragging me along just as someone to fall back on when the person they are interested in doesn't have that mutual feeling. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis shit is so shallow and superficial. And I am so lonely to the point where I am addicted to it and can't quit.

It has created infinite platforms where communication of all levels can be achieved. This \"power,\" in my mind, is bringing death to the younger generations. They (the younger generation) choose to make friends with people via social media but often times the friendship is superficial, it ends just as fast as it started. Society has lost the aspect of face to face interactions, which I believe, is where we truly find our life long friends. It's not just what we say but the actions, the emotions, the touch of the person (friend) where we truly find our significant other or our true life-long friends or quite simply friends. I hated talking to my ex on social media, it just ruined the aspect of what communication  is really defined as. This was a huge part of why we broke up. \n\nSorry I was diverging. \n\nCommunication. Friends. Love.\n\nIf you have none of these, wouldn't you be lonely? \n\nThe aspect of communication have been digitalized. I'm wrong? Prove me wrong. Where is your handwritten mail?  Humans were never built to communicate without seeing the person being talk to. We were built to communicate with our voice. Humans is on top of the food chain because of the ability to speak and communicate ideas and knowledge. Without speech we would be useless. \n\nI think this is where I will stop.

{"post_id": "bcx7xx", "created_utc": 1555201575, "title": "Being single and no friends really sucks, forever alone it seems...", "author": "Biguy051986", "self_text": "I am honestly starting to hate the online dating world. I have used online dating for the past 14 years or so. I have never been good at making friends or even talking to people outside of work. I have been single for I'd say 29 of the 33 years I've been alive. I have almost come to terms that I will probably be single for a long time. Yup, this is going to be long. Want to give a little back story, etc....\n\nI never dated when I was in school and didn't go on a single date until I was 20 years old and I had moved to the big city. When I was in high school, I think it was, grade 8-10, I wrote love letters to a couple of girls, ya that was the biggest mistake ever. The one girl shot me down completely, told her friends and made fun of me. The other girl I bought flowers and left them at her place with a letter at her back door. Well, the mom was the one who found them and she decided to tell the school that I had done this because she had read the letter. I can't remember what all I had written in it, but it was a couple pages I think. So after she told the school, I got called into the office then had to see the school counselor for a while. After that I just stopped trying to find a girl who liked me.\n\nThere was one girl when I was in grade 11 or 12 and I don't honestly know if she actually liked me or she was just teasing me. When ever I would be walking in the hall and she would see me and she was with her friends she would always say \"hi sexy\". I would just ignore her as most people never paid me any attention. After a while it was really starting to get on my nerves and I basically told her to just stop. She never talked to me again after that basically. I did eventually see her 3 years after we had graduated and she was married with kids.\n\nWhen I moved to the big city I went on I'd say maybe 6 dates or so and that is it. I would of course always screw it up somehow and it didn't help that I couldn't read their body language or the subtle hints. I was never really any good with the dating stuff. About 4-6 months before I moved back to my home town I had moved an old neighbour to live with me as I kicked out the ex-friend I had moved with. She was double my age. She was actually the first woman I had any kind of sexual contact with. I won't go into details here, but we never had sex. It didn't last very long as I had moved back to my hometown 4-6 months later and she stayed, found someone her own age.\n\nThere was one time when I was around 18 or so and I was using Lavalife and MSN Messenger.... I was chatting with this one woman and she said to me that our conversation was so boring that she would rather gouge her eyes out with a fork than be talking with me.\n\nI eventually moved up to where I live now. I have been on a lot of different site over the years. I have been on quite a few dates, but all but three lasted only around 3 dates or so and that's it. Two of the women I met we were together for around a year and then the last woman I was with it last for about 3 months. I didn't loose my virginity until I was 28 and it has been 8 months since I was last with anyone.\n\nI have only ever really dated women until last year when I went on a total of like 4 dates with guys. It has been hard, trying to figure out who I am attracted to, but I have come to realize that I would honestly prefer to be with a guy than a girl. The last girl kind of helped pushed me that way as well because when we went our separate way she said to me \"I can kind of tell that you really aren't into women\". I have never had anyone actually say that to me before, so it really caught me off guard.\n\nI was using POF for the last year, I had ended up only seeing 3 guys, none of which ended up working out. For the past two months though I have been giving Tinder a try. At first I tried looking for women, just for the sake of trying and in two weeks I had got not a single match. So I changed my search to looking for guys. In the past 6 weeks I have matched with a total of around 6-8 guys. Any that I have matched with I have sent messages. I have made sure to make them a few sentences, try to start a conversation. Not a single one ever replied.\n\nIt is so disheartening, it really is. I am a bit picky when I am swiping and I would say I swipe left on most profiles. To me, if you can't take the time to actually fill out some profile info telling a bit about yourself and what you are looking for, then I swipe left. I also swipe left on people who have pet as I am not a pet person and am allergic to cats. If you in a relationship, then I swipe left. I have swiped right on quite a few though, but I never seem to get any matches. I am pretty close to just giving up.\n\nFor me online dating is about the only way for me. I don't drink, don't party or go clubbing and I could never go up to a guy and ask them out. I am a shy person outside of work and home until I get to know someone. I also have zero friends besides my family so don't have any one I can talk to or do things with or get to hook me up. It also doesn't help that I don't like talking or watching sports, politics, not into 420 at all.\n\nI don't want to use grindr because I am not wanting hook-ups, one night stands, FWB, etc... I have done the one time thing with a few guys while trying to figure things out and I don't want to do that again. All I want is a long term monogamous relationship with no pets, is that such a hard thing to ask for?\n\nI'm 33 now and I though by now I would have found my life partner. I should mention I am male. My younger brother by 2 years will be married for 10 years this year and has 4 girls. Every time I go over to their place it hurts that I still haven't found someone.\n\nFor me though, the search has to really find someone this year. My grandpa passed away last year before I was able to find someone, I can't have my grandma gone before I find someone as well. Everyday that passes without finding the special someone is another day that I get more depressed and my heart aches. We don't have long on this world, I may have another 45 years if I last as long as my grandpa and I don't want to spend it alone.\n\n\\----------------------------------------------------\n\ntl;dr -&gt; Online dating sucks, meeting someone sucks, being an introvert sucks, being alone and no friends sucks.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnyone have any kind of advice? I'm not ugly by any means. I do open up quite a bit once I know someone..... Any questions please ask and I'll try to answer....", "subreddit": "ForeverAlone"}

But she was persistent through my \"stupidity of youth \" phase of life and as I got older I thought that she really loved me because she stuck by me all this time .she had a child from a previous relationship that was my daughter because her bio dad wasn't in the picture and then we had my son.i should have known then that I was in trouble because I was sleeping on the couch every night and wasn't allowed a key to my home even though I paid for everything also she refused to put me on the lease .after he was born it was odvous she was depressed I tried to get her to talk to someone I try to get her family to talk about it but no one could ,she didn't want to, she would start staying gone and leaveing me with the kids .and that was life I tried to ask what she was doing because she held on to my money and debit card and I got a $60 bi weekly allownce,  I thought it was drugs or men , turns out it was both. Found out the same day I had to bail her out of jail on 4 felony counts of drug possession. I stay with her for a year or so after being abused in font of the kids emotionally and Physically..after I left she immeadtly moves in the guy that she cheated on me with and I have not  seen my kids in 2 months after being the only one with the for all of their lives. .i speak to there daycare lady every now and then she says the kids are doing good so im happy about that..(nither are in school yet by the way) I've been talking to another girl because I needed somone to talk to and found out immediately that I care for her alot, thats I lie I fell in love with her ... I have a tendency to throw everything I have into a relationship,  but she only uses me as her backup plan..we arnt official so I can't be upset and I tell her I'm not jealous and it don't bother me mainly because I don't want her to lie to me  but I so am because all the other guys she talks to she tells me how much she loves them and how much trouble she is in ..and I want her to be in trouble with me so danm bad ..so here I sit alone drinking wishing anyone wanted  to be around me ...wanting to know if anyone else could give me advice..I know im stupid,  I know I've made alot of mistakes,  I'm not perfect by any means but if anyone has advice I would take it desperately", "subreddit": "lonely"}

I've become this nihilistic shell of a person.\n\nYour childhood was bad due to bullying so you never developed correctly into an adult. In my case you work at a dead end job. You get treated like crap there but you don't have the energy to fight it. You get home from that crappy job and sit on here listening to music from that childhood thinking about how it used to be better when in your case it wasn't better. You tried changing your life but failed. You eventually ran out of energy after you kept failing and have accepted that you will always be FA because there is no more energy to try to change anything. \n\nPeople accuse you of being an evil incel or nice guy when in reality, you only hate yourself. Hating other people takes energy and caring about the issues that cause those people to have that hatred for society or any group in society. You see those groups and can only shake your head. You know that while people accuse you of being one of them, you know that having those strong opinions means they have the energy to care about those supposed issues that you don't have because you don't have that energy and the only hatred you have is towards yourself.\n\nYou see your existence as meaningless. You try to fill the void with in my case video games, but some people use drugs, drink, or other types of ways people deal with being FA. Sometimes at night you sit at your computer reading other subs seeing a life that you will never get to experience. \n\nWhen you open your eyes in the morning you are disappointed. That means another day existing in a world that seems to want you to suffer. It's not true but it feels like it sometimes. \n\nPeople tell you to stop living in self-pity. Take a shower(20 times), go to the gym, get a haircut, get therapy, dress better, join hobby groups, volunteer to try and finding meaning in your life. People tell you how you have to learn to find happiness even if you are FA with no friends. The problem is, you ran out of gas years ago to have that energy. \n\nI'm going to go to my dead end job in a few hours. I will get yelled at. I will be told by my therapist supervisor how he expects more out of me. I will see happy couples and groups of friends. I will see that life that I will never get to live.

My apologies in advance if I've hurt anyone with this post. \n\n\n\n\nA while ago, while skimming through a magazine about philosophical topics, I stumbled upon a small article in which someone made a theory I still can't get out of my head.\n\nThe author, as far I can remember, believed most people nowadays who suffer from loneliness and the effects of it rather have somewhat of an inability of dealing with solitude. \nHe went further and claimed that through such things as social media as a fake image that wrongfully displays the seemingly  constant activity and presence of people, humans gradually tend to lose their ability of being alone by their own. \nPeople, he said, can't be alone anymore because they think they need to be somewhere, especially online, all the time. \n\nHe stated examples, such as many famous people and eremites who withdrew from society back in the earlier days so they could spend their time with \"important\" things such as philosophy, etc.. Comparing them to us nowadays, he believed many people who complain or talk about loneliness rather just have lost their sense of spending time with themselves.\n\n\nI hope I was able to write down all the important aspects of that article as neutrally and well as I could. If not, I'm sorry for any grammatical or logical mistakes. \n\n\n\nMy question is: do you, as members of this sub and as people who probably would consider themselves lonely, think there might be something onto that?

It seems the more I look and want love the harder is it to get. Im not even talking about romance anymore, I just want human to human loving contact but all I seem to get is crap. \n\nMy life so didn't use to be like this, when I was younger I had the world as my oyster. I had 5 best friends, the most loving parents, an older sister, and I would complain about how hard it was to get rid of guys because they kept falling in love. Well be careful what you wish for.\n\nEverything changed after my best friends mom committed suicide when I was 13 years old, almost immediately I went from being a cheerleader to a pot smoking glam punk. I had no idea it was connected with the death but now as an older person I am able to realize that. Well anyways I fell into a deep depression, developed major breathing problems and a movement disorder called Dystonia, Which is fucking scarring, embarrassing as fuck, and permanent. (look up videos so you can get an idea of how horrific it is, and I get about 10-50 \"tics\") a day since I was 13 and now I am 26. I am able to hide them pretty well but of course when I go into social situations that's when they come out the most so of course I have developed a major social anxiety because I get these in front of people. Which is so hard because I love being around people but I am so scared ill get those things so I don't know what to feel. \n\nAnyways in high school I really rebelled and stupidly didn't want to spend time with my family and just pushed them away. I had 2 best friends which was great until senior year when one got a very serious bf and she drifted apart (which I wasn't going to give her shit for because I was her friend) and the other turned into a crazy alcoholic. So after school let out we all drifted apart but no huge fight or anything really major happened so I figured it was just us growing up. I ended up going to a community college and for those of you who were lucky enough to go to a real college then you must know that they are so impersonal. Community colleges are for school not making friends or parties. So I made no friendships like how I used to have then fast forward to when I was about 22, I bought concert tickets for my old best friends birthday but she outright refused to accept them or even talk to me. she had this other girl that we used to be friends with (apparently shes roommates with a group of girls we hungout with) so she cut me out of her life and like I said I have no fucking idea why. She just got serious with her bf so I figured she cut everyone out since her and I were literally inseparable. So I got very offended and called her out on it and that cemented the end of our friendship. I started dating this fuck and we ended up together for 6 fucking years. the piece of shit was the final nail in my coffin. he cut me off from the world and made all my profiles private. I couldn't hang with my friends or even talk to guys. you guys might be wondering why the fuck I was with him and I wish I had an answer for you. He obviously wasn't like this in the start, it was very gradual. and once he cuts everything off your left with nothing and you know that if you leave him you really will have nothing and have a huge possibility of being homeless. he knew that too he wouldn't let me get a job so he was pretty much blackmailing me, knowing that it was either him or the streets. well I did everything possible for him to leave me but nothing worked. well that is until the devil stepped into my life. sometimes the devil is so well hidden you welcome him into your life, not knowing what evil and horror they will bring. \n\nSierra Meysami I hope you burn in hell you stupid miserable druggie bitch. I knew that cunt since I was 4 years old. She was part of that huge \"amazing\" group of friends I had growing up. Then she grew up and turned into human filth ie. heroin addict and homeless. Well living in a car which theres actually a news article about that and how she was bringing down Orange County. but anways her mom called me begging to help her since I was the only one who didn't tell her to fuck off. well I stupidly let that bitch into my house and she proceeded to rob me blind about 10 grand. I wish that was all she did. I had introduced her to my bf thinking maybe he could give her some advice. Advice my ass. They ended up having a secret affair, he would fuck her then me (she was on heroin remember). He would take her out to group dinners and clubbing. (im talking 20 people plus and no one told me) Then she secretly moved in with him. I know its a blessing in disguise but im literally left with nothing while she took my life, my friends, my house, my man, my dignity.\n\n\nAfter all this I was left destroyed, I couldn't do anything but lay in bed so I decided to get the hell out of America. my dad lives in mexico so I decided to go there and of course it got worse. i got robbed at gunpoint and my identity got stolen. Not to mention my dad secretly married some bitch who literally could've been Sierras mom shes such a cunt. the whole time I was really depressed because my dad refused to speak English with me (and the bitch wife actually started cracking up when I was crying out of frustration) and he left me there for 2 weeks even though I had no phone so he could go on vacation with the cunt and he left the day I arrived even though he was begging me to come. So many things happened where I didn't feel like his daughter anymore so I made that very clear. I was fighting but I was fighting for love. The only 2 points I would ever say was \"I don't feel like his daughter anymore\" and I wanted my dad back. SO after one particularly big argument my dad proceeded to punch me to the ground then stomped me as hard as he could 7 times. (in my entire life he had never put a fucking finger on me and I know that bitch changed him). my dad had messed me up so bad I had to go to the doctors and couldn't walk right for weeks afterwards. the second I wasn't limping I got the fuck out of mexico thinking my mom would let me come home but was I wrong.\nI know I was a pain in the ass, I know I had rebelled but I never thought my mom would just stop loving me. But she acutally said she wished she wasn't my mom anymore, that I am freak, loser, weirdo that she wanted me out of her life. I don't understand I didn't physically hurt anyone, or steal anything. I just was a stupid teenager, parents aren't supposed to give up like that. This one kid shot both his parents, killing his mom, yet his dad still visits him in prison. I didn't do anything even a quarter of that bad but I still lost my mom.\n\nThere was nothing but horrible sad memories in that city so I moved an hour away and I still cant get settled. My first roommate was so inane i literally had to sneak out when i moved out. I was there for a month and half and he wouldn't give me a key. We had no wifi, no tv, no refrigerator and in the last 2 weeks all the wall plugs but one stopped working. not to mention he would blast music at full volume until 4 am and when i initially moved in there was a futon. but he actually took it away out of spite (he got angry because i went out?) everytime i left the house and come back he would eat my food or take away something (like the bed) it was uterlly insane but i was so beyond broke and no help whatsoever. It was literally streets or this and not to mention it was a couple months ago when it wouldn't stop raining (it got California out of the 10 year drought) so it was absolutely freezing. the day i got money i literally snuck out while he was taking a shower. i was so scared, i had to make a couple trips back and forth and i really thought he would kill me if he saw me(he had a bat right next to the door) my heart was beating out of my chest the whole time.\n\nthen i finally found a place that seems ideal, there are 3 pups here that have become my life. (animals and i have always bonded because all they want is love and they sense that's all i want too) and its a decent house that has everything that the other place didn't not to mention a private room that's detached. but of course the owner has to have the craziest temper. he is so ocd i am scared to use the kitchen because even if i clean but not to his expectations then he screams at me. its so confusing because hell get super nice and become my best friend for a couple days or weeks but then out of nowhere hell just start bitching about nothing or something that happened forever ago. He has \"kicked\" me out 3 times already all for ridiculous reasons. and normally i would just leave but if i lose these pups. the only living breathing things that have shown me love for the first time in 8 years then ill lose it. I know it may sound ridiculous to some but when even your own mom rejects you and you finally get to cuddle a loving being that worships your every move, you cant just leave it. I don't know what to do, i want to stay but i am miserable. but i don't even know what i want anymore. i wanted romance so bad but honestly what are the chances of not being cheated on, of actually being treated good and not like crap. SO not high so i really just give up. There is no point in pursuing romance anymore i just want love from my mom and dad. If i could press a button and make everything perfect, i would have my family back, id have a safe place to live where i don't have to worry if ill still be there the next day, id still have my pups and thatd be it. im not asking for the world, i just want peace. Im sorry for making this so long, i really wasn't planning on it. but  you guys are all i have left. if you actually made it this far then i definitely commend you.", "subreddit": "lonely"}

Its killed me and I'll say it as a sweeping statement my generation. However, it could be me but if you're following this then you might agree with it. We spend hours looking through our phones, I can personally click through three different apps on an evening looking at a news feed and see plenty of different things:\n- Person taking a selfie\n- Theyve gone some where out for tea or on holiday \n- a photograph of a pet, something interesting or an event \n- a good meme, personal favourite \n\nHowever, we live in the most connected time yet... we are totally disconnected, what happens when that person takes that photo and posts it online? They see their likes whether it's a large or small amount and that's their gratification, good job. In a bigger sense for me I get my 10-20 likes depending on what I've put on and then it's back to the same old scrolling. I can sit at home, sit and wait for a phone to buzz. \n\nWe are all sat in one room, waiting for a phone to buzz, our gratification, what happens when nobody is there? You become lonely, loneliness is my own worst enemy. I use tinder and no I'm not just bitter because I dont get matches but what I'm trying to understand is what's on the other end? A social interaction that is waiting, I know nobody has tinder to make friends I'm not sat under a rock writing this yet there is a massive blockade between a left and right swipe isn't there? Maybe my photos of me dont light my face right or the simple fact I'm wearing glasses and I've got a bad dress sense (yeah I understand it now) but for others we can sit and think \"I'm not good enough\" not even one match. Nothing. I dont get any recognition for the time and effort on my pictures. Nothing. How does it make you feel? Like nothing? \n\n\"Takes more muscle effort to frown than to smile\" yet the emotional effort it takes to keep a smile up is why we have high suicide rates and the people who are dear to us smile in their photos when nobody can tell theyre in pain.\n\nI know we all can see a facade and know we are making one too.

I\u2019ve had one relationship in high school, but have spent the last 5 years single.

I wake up early in the morning, go to college, then back home. If I have some free time I like to listen to music, browse the internet, play some games and do some miscellaneous stuff.\n\nSeems pretty standard for a college student right? The thing is, if you replace \u201ccollege\u201d with \u201cschool\u201d, that\u2019s exactly all I have ever done in my entire life. Two decades compressed into few lines of text.

One of my lady friends is working in a project to automate production lines using state of the art tech, and getting paid 2K for it.

I have had plenty of girls used me over the years, and other few incidents which have scared me, and hurt my ability to learn how to behave properly.  \n\n\nAnyways, I am a tad bit overweight, which never helped either. But I am doing decent on that, lost 60 lbs quickly on a diet (gained 20 back when I stopped it, Its a work in progress) trying to make myself look better. Apparently, I still do not look good, every time online dating I get a match, they instantly unmatch when they see my picture.  \n\n\nAnyways fast forward to this week, which I honestly never thought it could have gotten any worse.  \nI was diagnosed with psoriasis when I was a child, but it was never anything serious. It has caused some stares, and disgusting comments as a kid but nothing too bad. I just had it minor on my elbows and ankles. (Stupid me I always dressed in shorts, and sandals as a kid refusing to cover up my areas because I preferred to be comfortable rather than stylish)  \n\n\nThis week my psoriasis has gotten exponentially worse. And I was diagnosed just recently with a slew of health problems, including one of the worse cases of psoriasis, making my entire body break out in severe hives. I look like a walking diseases infested cesspool of disgusting. It's not contagious at all, not harmful to other people at all just to me. BUT I'll never get the chance to explain that to people, as everyone's first impression will automatically be \"Nasty\"  \n\n\nI am hoping the meds I was prescribed will clear it up, but if it does not, I have to deal with this for the rest of my life looking like this. ANd it might even get worse..... I'll never have the opportunity to experience the joy of love, one of the most desirable things I ever want. I want a family so bad. So so bad. I want kids, desperately. No, not like the kind that will get me on /r/suddenlysexoffender but the joy kids give parents. I've always loved kids. Again, not like that.

However, I never feel anything during these interactions. I don't want to be alone but talking with others doesn't bring me the happiness that I once thought it would. I would like to find someone who will love me unconditionally and maybe help me feel again. I heard someone say they wouldn't mind not talking to anyone if they had just one person who was always with them.

Not ugly, not gorgeous - pretty average, I'd say.\n\nSocial skills: below average, especially with guys. Never had a guy friend. \n\nI started grad school last fall recognizing that I probably wouldn't get into a relationship or even a friendship with a guy. If it didn't happen in college or high school, why now? \n\nAbout 2 months in, I met Paul through Maria, a friend of mine (not real names). He instantly made me feel at ease. Knew my name before I told him. Maria created a study group and soon I started seeing a lot more of Paul. Paul was funny, he would laugh at my jokes and genuinely seemed to want to get to know me.\n\nFlash forward 6 months - Paul is a close friend, we often hang out both 1-on-1 and in groups. I ask him for help, and he asks me for help. My friendship with Paul is the same as my friendship with Maria or any of my other friends, who all happen to be female.\n\nThis whole time I thought there was something wrong with me - that I could never be friends with a guy because I couldn't act \"normal\" around them. Maybe I had nothing in common with them or I wasn't \"attractive\" enough to be their friend (which doesn't make sense, I know) or my social skills scared them away. I blamed myself. \n\nIt turns out that I just never encountered the type of guys who wanted to befriend me. I needed someone to be extroverted and take a genuine interest in me. I always encountered this with girls, and never with guys. \n\nWhat I learned is that intrinsic factors (confidence level, social skills) can only get you so far, but in the end, if you don't meet people who are interested in you, you won't get anywhere. \n\nThere were times in my life that I was friendly and inviting, but guys didn't give a shit for whatever reason. I need to accept that. It's not exactly a positive message, but at least this experience helped me realize that I'm totally capable of being in a relationship or friendship with a man. It's just a matter of time until I meet someone who I click with. \n\nBonus: for those of you wondering if anything more is possible between Paul and me - we've already talked about it and it's not gonna happen. From what I gather, we're attracted to each other, but we have incompatible religious beliefs (mostly his decision, not mine :/).\n\n**tl;dr: blamed myself for being FA for years, but a friendship made me realize that a lot of guys are just not interested in getting to know me and I can't do much about that.**", "subreddit": "ForeverAlone"}

I'm a 22 year old college student that's graduating this year (senior). I have been at or near the top of every single class in a competitive pre-med program. My academic success is well known to the point where I have had random underclassmen ask me to tutor them for money just through word of mouth, and I am kind of well known within the program for being \"that guy\" that sets the curve and whatnot. I am going to be attending a top 10 medical school after I graduate, and I think with my academic strength, I will have a high chance of specializing into Radiology or Dermatology.\n\nI don't think I'm that good looking, but I am definitely not ugly either. I have been going to the gym for about a year (I used to jog, but I thought muscle mass building would be a nice switch), and have a decent, but not outstanding body. One girl (I heard about this much later) in my 2nd year even described me to one of her friends as \"cute\" but she would not want to date me. I have a fairly active social life and a really great close group of friends, and I get invited to plenty of things like parties, kickbacks, eating out etc.\n\nHowever, I have not had a single, tiny, shred of success romantically. I can't get a single date. All of my friends have or have had multiple relationships, and from my observation (I was usually there when stuff happened) they weren't really looking or trying to hard, it just happened so naturally. One minute they were friends, and suddenly they are dating.\n\nI have not tried too hard regarding this in the past because schoolwork and academic success took priority, but I have been getting a bit concerned that being 22 and not having any dating experience is probably not a good thing. I have been going fairly out of my way for the past year to try and connect with someone romantically, but it's really clear that anybody I talk to just is not interested in me in that way (I'm pretty good at reading people). I don't push further because honestly the last thing I want is for people to think I'm a creep. Every single one of my guy friends has gotten \"attention\" in that way from women, but I don't think I have ever been considered in such a manner.\n\nPersonality-wise, I would say that I'm honestly pretty passive (definitely not an alpha male type), and a tad shy, but really nothing too extreme. I am extremely driven, and I have been actively pursuing any kind of self-improvement that I have agency over since secondary school.\n\nI'm honestly really confused. The only thing that I can think of is that I had a very rough time in secondary school. I was without any friends for quite a while, and bullied a lot, which gave me some pretty bad social anxiety. I still have this, but these past few years I have gotten really good about managing it. I am really good at covering it up to the point where I smashed my medical school interviews despite being terrified out of my mind. I am still sometimes nervous when I talk to people though, even people I have known a while, I think I am good at hiding it though, but on occasion I do get awkward.\n\nMy family is also quite affluent (1 mill a year income approx), and although I don't really show it on a day to day basis (no fancy clothing, car, watch, etc.) my extended social circle does know about it.\n\nSo on paper, I shouldn't be having that much trouble. Obviously I'm far from perfect, but I did not think that the pre-requisite for a relationship was perfection. There are lazy bums I know that do nothing for their future and sit around smoking weed all day and they seem to have no trouble finding a relationship.\n\nRight now my hypothesis is that somehow people can kind of subconsciously sense my nervousness and lack of confidence, but it doesn't effect anything except when it comes to romance, OR that everyone has a \"type\" and that my specific combination of looks, mannerisms, and personality does not attract anybody romantically (aka that I am just nobody's \"type\")\n\nI am definitely not complaining about my life, and I am very thankful for what I have. I don't even know what the point of this post is to be honest. Just thoughts that I have had on my mind for a while, but nobody to share them with.\n\nThanks for reading!\n\nPS: I know this might all be a bit hard to believe, objectively. Like none of my friends really understand it, and I myself am really confused about my FA status as well. I wish there was some way to prove this all without giving up personal information :/", "subreddit": "ForeverAlone"}

I don't want people to feel bad, so I won't say everyone feels this way.\nI wonder, sometimes, if everyone is capable of making super meaningful relationships, like in stories. Very recently, I realized that most of my ideals have been based off of fiction. But, as a kid, I didn't understand that fiction was a way for adults to understand and simplify the world. Real, but not real. \nThough, I need more than an ideal; I need reality. But, where do I look for it? How do I look for it? At the very least, I know I have to be the \"real\" me, and not just act how others want me to.\nI am not sure what else to write. \nI want to make friends and I have a tendancy to be too nervous or let the wrong people in, and leave the moment it starts to hurt. But, I don't want to live in isolation. I don't want to feel bad all the time, and even when I do feel bad all the time, it would be nice to know someone would be there to listen. \nHonestly, I've gone about friendship completely wrong, most of the time. I tried to start in reverse -- with things like tinder, or talking my heart out. But, eventually, I learned people don't start at 100, normally. (People shouldn't start at 100.) Right now, I feel like I'm starting at 0. \nIt is like as I get older, I feel like the things I needed as a child will still comfort me. I just want to talk on the phone for hours and laugh about dumb stuff. I want to hang out and go places. I am tired of never going outside. I am tired of always thinking to myself and feeling like I am wrong all the time. None of that matters. I just want to feel like I exist, again.

I am 14 going on 15, and as I get closer to the end of my first year, I\u2019ve realized so much about myself - or maybe made things up.\n\nI\u2019ve never known that many people other than the ones I knew from elementary school (as I never went to middle school). A lot of those people have since branched out and seem to be having a great time with other new people, and I find myself having no such connections. It\u2019s just me myself and I.\n\nBeing alone more often has made me realize a lot about myself. I think what is most pressing for me is that I know I\u2019m very different from everyone else. It\u2019s not the \u201coh, look at me, I\u2019m unique\u201d type of different. It\u2019s the kind that makes you think there is something off about yourself. People my age are loud, speak their mind, use the fuck out of social media, and are so invested in today\u2019s pop culture. I\u2019m the complete opposite, and even sometimes have to ask how to navigate through an app because I don\u2019t know how to use it. I feel like an old woman and I\u2019m only 14...godamn.\n\nThis isn\u2019t to say I\u2019m completely detached from the world. I\u2019m not sheltered by my parents, I have no restrictions on my internet usage or whatever. Apps like YouTube and reddit keep me in check. They\u2019ve also helped me explore my interests in ways more in depth than I\u2019ve ever known before (I\u2019ve taken an interest in music theory and guitars actually \ud83d\ude0c). I find myself rambling about my interests TO MYSELF for almost HOURS ON END when it\u2019s late at night.  I wish soooooo badly to have someone I can have these in depth conversations with, not surface talk and petty gossip. And it doesn\u2019t even have to be about my interests at this point; I want to talk about life experiences and stories, and about love and lust and just being human in general. THERE IS SO MUCH IN MY HEAD :(\n\nBut everyone my age (I really do not want to make myself look \u2018superior\u2019 by any means tho) don\u2019t seem to be capable of that. Maybe they are, but to them I guess it\u2019d feel more like a lecture than an enjoyable, thought-provoking conversation. All they ever talk about are the tiniest, close-minded things.\n\nThere is obviously a fear of being told that I think too much, and that people will tell me the useless thing of \u201cI\u2019m too dumb for this\u201d. Because of this fear, I\u2019ve never told anyone any of these thoughts, even if sometimes they are what keep me up at night. It sucks, having so much to say but no where to say it. \n\nSo now I\u2019m stuck. Am I just outgrowing everyone I knew before? Is my mind way older than my age (F14)? Am I better off finding older/wiser people to be friends with? Or am I just out of place, weird, and think way too much for my own good? \n\nAnd why the fuck is there no one like me who I can share these thoughts with? I wish there was.\n\n\n\n\ntldr; I can\u2019t tell if I\u2019m an old soul or just weird as hell.", "subreddit": "lonely"}

When I lie in bed during the weekend and think of getting up to do something, I've finally been catching on that the reason I can't find the motivation is a small voice inside that says, \"Why, when there's no one to do it for?\" No one to do chores for, no one to crochet for (I've been trying to get myself to learn as a hobby), no one to watch TV with or discuss shows with. So why?\n\nI admire those who are self-motivated, but I seem to lack that almost completely. When someone is around, I get a burst of energy and want to vacuum or whatever. But of course if someone is around it's because they want to hang out, not watch me vacuum, so THAT never works out, haha.\n\nEven when I do manage to get up during the weekend, after a while I can't figure out what to do with myself. So back to bed I go. It's been a vicious battle. And now it's starting to affect my after-work life too (I work the stereotypical routine of Monday-Friday).

I've talked with men and women for years about this. I ask them why and the answer is usually the same thing. FA'ers may get some experience with it. The feeling when you find someone to be very attractive and will put up with a lot of bad stuff to stay with them. \n\nWe constantly get told on here how looks aren't important compared to confidence and personality. Maybe for some people but if you think someone is a 10/10, you are going to excuse some of their toxic behavior to still be with them. I've talked to so many people about this. A guy told me about how his girlfriend is crazy and constantly verbally abuses him. I said, why are you still with her? He said, dude, she's hot. The odds are I'm never going to be able to get with someone who looks like her again. Same goes for a woman I talked to. For a few months she complained to me about her abusive boyfriend. He was on drugs, abused her, and she said how she wants to get away from him. She said I want to but while there other codependency issues, a night with him is better than nights with every other guy she's been with combined, and she just can't walk away from that. \n\nOne of the things I never understood when I talked to people was their irrational decisions to get with certain people. As a FA'er, while I did have a oneitis who was using me, I got a feeling of ignoring obvious red flags due to physical attraction.\n\nPeople can tell us how important confidence and personality are but I will never believe them. Yes, confidence and personality matter but without them having that physical attraction towards you, in reality, even if they seem to be interested in you, is that you are a placeholder until they find someone else who they are more attracted to. Obviously people have different ideas on what they consider a 10/10 who they are attracted to so it can be a different type of person. PUA's will talk about game which is laughable, or some outsider will tell you how people can tell that you obviously are full of hate. If they find you that type of attractive, none of that matters. Most of us who are FA so I'm not talking about the person who broke up with their significant other two weeks ago calling themselves FA, don't have any experience with this type of thing. Some people had a relationship years ago and forgot about it or never experienced that type of attraction that people can feel. That raw physical attraction that makes people do illogical things is so important but people prefer to talk about confidence and personality more.", "subreddit": "ForeverAlone"}
{"post_id": "beb2ap", "created_utc": 1555524756, "title": "Hey young people (Part II)...", "author": "[deleted]", "self_text": "So...\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHere's an update on a [thread I posted a while ago](https://www.reddit.com/r/ForeverAlone/comments/b8peal/hey_young_people/).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, I read a lot of the responses here. Some surmised that I must be ugly. Some told me to get over myself. Some people had decent advice, or told me something that I knew deep down to be true. So I did what any person would do in this situation. I got dumb and made a vague offer to go out for drinks to talk to the woman in the post. She didn't respond.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nYeah, it fell flat. In fact, the look I saw in her eye when she was processing the request horrified me that I even bothered asking in the first place. I was able to smooth it over and she doesn't really suspect my intentions anymore, and she is happily off dating a guy she met using an online dating app.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo yeah. I was crushed. I lost sleep. I hated myself. I wanted to get drunk and take a leap off a bridge. I did none of those things.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIn fact, I got really, really mad at myself.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI couldn't believe that this stupid f---ing set of blinders I had made me think that only this woman was going to make me happy. I couldn't believe that I had no control over the Id in my personality (Freud was right). The Id, the inner child, that boy wanted the girl, and there was no substitute.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI had to put this part of myself in its place once and for all. Because it had me thinking that if I couldn't receive the affections of this woman, then no other woman was good enough, and I didn't even want to make the slightest effort to give any other woman a chance. In fact, if a woman had given me that type of attention and was making strong overtures to be with me, I probably would have crapped all over her intentions, hurt her feelings, and pushed her away, and harder than I have pushed away anyone. I would have been worse than the woman I had a crush on, but my feelings wouldn't have been inadvertently or unintentionally hurting the other person. Nope, mine would have been vengeful, bitter, and just plain mean.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI would have turned my frustrations with not having what I wanted against an innocent person, a person that just saw something in me that was attractive or likeable, and wanted to have the opportunity to cherish and appreciate that. You know what that is? That's genuinely rotten. And immature. And that's my (me me me gimme gimme gimme) inner child that was saying it. My inner child wanted to throw a full-blown temper tantrum and hurt others to make itself feel better. And that honestly took me back a bit.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI stopped, and rationalized - maybe I was more focused on the concept. Maybe I was so hyper-focused on someone wanting me, I didn't think about it from the other side. I didn't stop to think \"what does he have to offer\". I didn't think about why someone would be interested in me, I just assumed that I was sooooo friggin' great that anyone could see it as plain as the nose on my face.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nGuys - especially the ones that feel as alone as I feel sometimes (and it hurts more than you can imagine), you need to stop and take a time out. You need to realize this too. For your own good. And you need to be an angry parent to that bitter child. You need to treat your inner child like he broke your favorite possession out of spite. You need to put that little f---er in his place. Because he doesn't know what's good for you, and never f---ing will.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI have since (and it hasn't been long) started to fix the things about myself I am not good with. I am back to an excercise regimen. I am still very much a friend to my co-worker, I didn't retreat, I didn't act stand-offish with her as a result. I didn't get angry. I got really, really depressed (duh), but I realized that if I cared THAT MUCH about her, I should at least take what I could get right now. Do I wish I could wave a magic wand and have her walk over now and sit on my lap and make out with me? Hell yeah! But I have a big scrolling red banner in my head that tells me WARNING, DO NOT PROCEED. Oh and another surprise - the more I talked to her, the more I realized that there are things about her I don't jive with, no matter how beautiful. She would not be supportive of me. And well, to hell with that!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI just resolved to just be satisfied that I am at least able to talk to her, which I always valued anyway. And I still have it. We still get along fine. No mace, no weirdness. Sharing a laugh and staying mellow. So, cool. Maybe when I'm an even more improved version of myself, who knows. Once I put myself in her place I realized that hey, maybe she gets tons of guys asking her out. Maybe it's an avalanche of unwanted advances. I put myself in her shoes. And, I felt bad for HER. And that's called compassion, kids. Now, I just needed to have compassion for my own goddamned self for ONCE. I was disgusted with how the inner child was ruling things in my head with respect to love.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAlso, I tried four dating apps. Not one... FOUR. I'm not going to advertise for the dating app I used, but if someone wants to know, I can tell them privately. And guess what? I started getting messages from interested women. WAIT, WHAT?!?!?!? Yeah, you read that right. I didn't do anything but build a profile that was honest and showed exactly who I was as a person (without being a negative jerk), and bang, messages from three women right away, and all I did was put up my profile and started swiping \"no... noooo. nooooo...\" with a grouchy no-faith having mug on my face.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnd well, guess what happened next. I had someone message me and we hit it off. She is into what I'm into. I can tell from our conversations she is definitely interested. And, I can honestly say I can see myself dating her. Do you have any idea what that made me feel like? Here I was the co-worker now, being pursued? That was a gigantic confidence boost, so I put that energy into talking to her. She told me she doesn't even talk to family the way she talks to me. Yeah, it's going well so far.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnd we have a date soon. HA!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo I guess this post is a retraction in a way. And it's another thing I want to tell the youth. Don't get hyper-focused on your loneliness. I still say your youth is as valuable as anything you could possibly own. I have decided not to waste anymore time. I just want to be happy. That's it. And I suspect that a lot of these \"forever alone\" miserable types on here want that exact same thing.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI want to sincerely tell you that you have to stop yourself. You need pause to assess what it is you want, and what compromises you will make to get it. Compromise doesn't mean date someone you don't want to be with. It means you need to change up how you're going about finding (or dare say attracting) someone you want to be with. Change your strategy.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnd for God's sake, if there's something you can change about yourself, and you don't like that something, then just for the love of all that is beneath the sun, JUST CHANGE IT. You're going to at least feel good about getting rid of things about you that cause you pain. And once those are on their way out, I dare say you might feel more confident, and you might abandon your rumination on how no one wants/loves you right now.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo wish me luck. And please, take the wheel away from your inner child and let the adult drive.", "subreddit": "ForeverAlone"}

My parents' relationship was never normal and mum and dad would fight all the time. My father was quite abusive and I always wanted to hide my family situation from people at school so I isolated myself spent recess alone, looking at the clouds. I lived in fear at home, and felt I had no privacy. My mum did so much for me and my siblings to get us the things we needed and wanted and I am very grateful for this. My computer and before that the shared family computer became my refuge. I took up programming and computer science as a hobby. However I missed out on everything normal families do, never went on vacation, almost never went out even though I really wanted to and it killed me inside not having this. Most of my schools were all boys ones and I hated the environment at them. Even at a young age I questioned the things people said and refused to give in to all the peer pressure to do things like calling people girls or gay as an insult.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy parents eventually separated, I spent my last 2 years before uni in the UK living with my mum only and things were so much better then. I made some friends although not super close ones and still felt quite emotionally damaged. I was quite happy though as I felt that the environment was a good cultural fit. We couldn't renew our visas so then my mum returned to my birth country and I went to university in Canada. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI liked my university but could never quite socialise here as I was not the partying type. I wanted fewer but closer friends something I could not find initially. I also felt excluded by people and always treated like a 3rd wheel whenever I did try to make friends. Eventually towards the end I adapted, found some really good friends and open minded people. Most of them were girls and I could really be myself around them and talk about my views without being mocked for being an SJW or whatever. It is strange because even though I'm a straight male who has never had a serious relationship, I feel a lot more comfortable talking to girls. With guys often I feel pressure to be someone I am not. Not every guy obviously there are many exceptions.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAfter graduation, I got a job at an engineering company. I feel so broken again. It bothers me that my family is so split in different countries and timezones. My mum, me and each sibling all live in a different place alone and we are all stuck where we are for our careers, immigration etc. I feel sick doing a 9-5 routine every day, I liked the variety and randomness at uni. My coworkers are all overconfident men who mock progressive people with SJW jokes, and make misogynistic remarks constantly. Initially they kind of expected me to be on their \"side\" now that they realise I think it isn't cool they treat me like I am some sort of buzzkill. I hang out sometimes with my uni friends but many of them have moved away and when I do I have a great time but they work too so it is quite rare. I feel really down and cry myself to sleep I can't think of a way to get out of this trap. I don't feel I'm ready for a relationship and to start a family and not sure if I want to ever do that. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI just want to be able to be around more like minded people. I get depressed when I see the state of the world with so many people voting for morally corrupt people etc. I feel jealous when I see people with normal lives, a family having fun. I'm scared if I lose the 2 friends I have I'll end up with absolutely no one.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI just do not know what to do. I feel like I'd be happier if I went back to the UK, I have friends and a sibling there but I don't know how I'd deal with immigration and becoming a citizen.", "subreddit": "lonely"}

We go to a magnet school based around the different types of arts and a category for STEM subjects. Due to how the school is set up, we have 2 category for students, 1's and 2's, 1's are freshman and sophomores and 2's are juniors and seniors. then those two groups are split into 2 categories, the art side and stem side. Me and the girl I like are on the art side, although they don't seem to focus on what i'm good at(media arts). I have a total of 3 classes with her, the first is math, but she sits on the opposite side of class so I cant really start a conversation with her. The next class is basically every other subject, and that class is 2 and a half hours long, however we are split into 3 sections, and were in separate sections. However soon we'll be placed in new groups for a project we have twice a year called Confluence which is really stressful, and there's a slim chance we could be placed in a group together. The final class I have with her is coding/electronics, and that class only has people work alone and there's no real way to start a conversation with her. She's pretty quiet so I can't just hop into a conversation she's in, and i'm to nervous/anxious to properly start a conversation.

{"post_id": "beidbi", "created_utc": 1555569467, "title": "Serious marital issues, feel worthless, guilty, confused..long story :/", "author": "Meriland31", "self_text": " \n\nSo a little backstory in reference to my health anxiety/me.\n\nRight before I was born, my dad was diagnosed with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy as well as heart failure. As a result, he went to the hospital frequently when I was young. Almost every other week. So most of my childhood was spent at the hospital or him talking about himself dying all the time. If I 'was' home (or not in school) I was by myself with my older sister because my parents went to the bar 6 days a week from when my mom got off work until bar close. I rarely ever got to see my mom, and if I did see her, she was belligerently drunk and extremely accusatory. The fights that they had were crazy. My mom stabbed my dad in the arm, cops came to the house sometimes, she threw hot fryer oil at him, strangled him, etc. It was toxic, especially since my dad was a provoking type of drunk. Me and my sister rarely ever had friends at the house cuz we felt embarrassed when they had arguments.\n\nWhen I was five, I developed a severe anxiety disorder / hypochondria problem. I didn't understand disease or anything I just felt...dread and the doctor suggested that I not watch anything remotely negative or scary to try and counter it. This persisted until I was 12. My mom insisted I try and deal myself for a multitude of reasons but really he didn't want anybody to know that there were 'problems'. When I was 13 I lost 4 close friends in middle school. Asthma attack, then a car accident, then a heart attack, and another car crash. All within 1 month of each other.\n\nThrough this time they're still going to the bar, my Dad's health was deteriorating slowly. His legs started to swell with blisters and I would have to put compression socks on him or push the water out of his legs on a nightly basis. My dad was not the nicest guy either once my sister left the house. Once I hit puberty and I started becoming my own person (pianist, cook, making myself look pretty), he would try and scare me out of doing things like..\"don't kiss a boy or else u'll get AIDS\", or when I was 15 and drank for the first time he sat on my lap and forced alcohol down my throat to teach me a lesson. These are the kind of things that were prevalent. My health anxiety as I got older wasn't as frequent but were still there and coincided with major events. And with the internet, WebMD became my go-to. I was so terrified of going to see a shrink, being told I'm crazy or something. I tried to deal with it/conquer it myself. From when I was a teen, I was told to get tested for IHSS cause it is 50% hereditary..so that if I had it, I knew my restrictions, but if I didn't know, sudden death was the usual symptom. My mom didn't find this necessary, but my dad did. When I was 19 I got into a relationship with a nice guy who turned into a violent sociopath. Beatings were normal, talking back wasn't allowed, and I decided to leave when he was killing my pets for fun. I had to fake a return ticket back to him so he'd let me leave, but I never came back.  \n When I was 24 I found out secondhand that my dad..wasn't my real dad. My mom had a secret affair with this guy who didn't want anything to do with me. Now this guy wanted back into my life and the dad I thought was mine biologically, was hurt by it.\n\nSkipping ahead to 2015. I was 28 when I met Ken at a 4 day wedding event in Colorado. The sweetest, most healthy, outgoing glass half full kind of person u'll ever meet. We really clicked, hit it off as friends, Etc. At the time he was in a relationship (Angie) which was kind of a bummer but asked me about polygamy which I never really thought about but was open to it I guess?\n\nSkipping ahead a couple months I came to visit him. At this point, we both had admitted we had crushes on each other despite the fact he was in a relationship... but they had an open relationship that his girlfriend agreed to. Ken told me that me and this girl named Sara are the only two people he's ever had a 'crush' on and that all the other people he's dated were just\u00a0 placeholders for whenever he meets ' the one'...so he isnt'alone'. This Sara pen pal person had helped him through his previous divorce in 2010 and as a result he developed a fixation on her. He wanted a relationship with her, to move cross country to be with her, she didn't want that, he got friendzoned and lost trust in her but they're still friends but he's still clearly butthurt over it.\n\nThe ENTIRE time I visited him he was snuggling/canoodling love-like with Angie which was bizarre and uncomfortable, especially since she'hes a 'placeholder' to him &amp; he had intentions of ending things with her. I told him not to string her along before so his romantic actions towards her were bizarre. Ntm the fact I was a friend/guest and when she was around I didn't exist essentially and had to entertain myself. Kinda rude. When I questioned him about it, he said it was just to make her feel better? That she insisted on being there my whole visit.\n\nAt the end of that visit, I got a call from my mother and my sister saying that my dad took a turn for the worst. I came home to find my dad in septic shock and all his SATs dropping. He died later that night.\n\nSkipping ahead through a lot of stuff. Ken eventually ended things with Angie, but was relationship phobic/ wanted FWB for now with me which was frustrating seeing as he wanted it so bad with Sara before. We visited each other a couple times, ended up agreeing for me to move in with him.\n\nWhen I moved, everything was fine- we were perfect. Ken is extremely outdoorsy adventurous. Like sit in a tree and read a book while petting a raccoon kind of adventurous and that's not me LOL. He had a Sara book which had old poems and all this other crap, pics of her, even a list of what he looks for in a partner which was in his stupid Sara book. Needless to say, even though they weren't going to BE together I really didn't like the fact that they were friends given all this shit. About a half a year in, I went on my Facebook and saw he was still logged in so I wanted to see what he was saying to her. I just couldn't help myself. Of course they were talking flirty, etc, she even mentioned taking him to HAWAII, and talking about how good she's with her fingers. Yuk. This was all recent stuff. I flipped on him and his lame ass excuse to the Hawaii thing was \" no we wouldn't spend any time together I lost trust in her it's just a way for me to get a free vacation out of her since I paid $3k for her to get her teeth fixed so long ago\". (Yes, this person he never met but ONCE he hotwired $3k to get her teeth fixed before we met) Totally normal friendship behaviour.\n\nA few months later I kind of snapped. I didn't want him to 'like' her anymore. I didn't want him emotionally cheating on me so I made a dumbass decision and created a fake account in her name spiting myself, and then I showed Ken and he blasted off on the REAL her. She had no idea what was going on and then he defriended her. After it happened, I regretted it. I was so disappointed in myself cuz it wasn't real and it made me an a\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*. It ate away at me. So I told him I did it, prepared myself for any consequences, and he's just like... \"Its okay, I didn't want to talk to her anyway\". Well okay then? So from then until now-- 3 years? He's always told me he doesn't even think about her, he doesn't even want to talk to her,\u00a0 doesn't care about her, she's just old news. And it was, Sara was old news to me and him. I hadnt thought about her in ages.\n\nKen asked me to marry him, we got planning underway, I had a 3 week health anxiety freak out that coincided with the wedding plans. I went to 3 neurologists who said I was fine. The wedding came, the health scare went. That was the only 'big' one for the next 2.5 years. (FYI Ken knew I had anxiety/hypochondria way long ago, I forewarned him of it in case I had a spell. He understood.). For the next few years, it was a good structure. I had a job with him, every day we snuggled, went to work, ate out, played cribbage, Netflix, spooning, laughed, talked, enjoying each others company. Most health concerns at that time throughout were quick and transient and didnt really interject. We had so much fun together..but then Kens parents wanted us to move in 3 months with then across country. After I quit my job to tend to getting ready for that, I had a full blown anxiety spell that wouldn't stop (Nov 2018). I didn't help as much as I should, Web MDing, not focused, out of it, scared out of my mind. At this point Ken was writing down logs (not a diary) on what happened/how he felt on it. A summary of it was like...\"why won't u get help?\", his frustration that me not getting help for my anxiety is a direct insult to him in our relationship, \"why do I have to be the goto for anxiety Qs? Why cant u ask a therapist or a friend? Which I always tell u to do?\", he tried to do fun things with me but I don't pay attention cuz I'm on WebMD or something, I wouldn't believe him about his feelings, or arguments we had about me worrying about him falling away and him getting completely stressed out, me not tending to his needs/feelings cause I was worried all the time, that I'm not acting like a partner, I'm not acting like the partner he requested, not holding my own, not eating, etc. I kept procrastinating going to get psycho help.. thinking it was not in my mind but really happening to me and he was sick of it. I don't blame him on that. I mean, if I were given a nickel every time he said \"lets go to a therapist, and maybe I can learn how to deal with it too\" I would be rich. This was not a hundred percent constant. I would say 40%. Everything in between was fun and uplifting and amazing but if I was on the phone even for a second, he got short with me. I tried to not bother him with it, deal with it myself, so I don't stress him out/ use him as a crutch.\n\nOn April 2, we went to eat, cracked jokes, I asked him if he wanted to go to the movies and he was all for it. I gave him a kiss on the forehead as he was texting a friend and the text looked like it'd be something bad about me. When I politely asked, he lied to me saying it was about work. I could tell he was lying and asked why and he said, \"cause I didn't want to start a fight before the movie\". I got angry, not cause he was talking to her about me, but him lying to me ABOUT me. I blew up. He went to the movie alone, and then he said this..\n\n\"\n\nU've never believed how I felt about u. I'm going to stop pretending that everything is okay cause it isn't. I don't want to sleep with u anymore, I don't want to do things with\n\nu\n\n, u're not the person I want to be with. I gave u many chances to get help, I'm done and I'd like u to go\"\n\nI bawled and made an ass out of myself..\n\nMe: \"I'm sorry...I'll get help I will\"\n\nK: \"it's too late, I'm done\"\n\nMe: \"do u really want me to leave?\"\n\nK:\"YES\"\n\nMe: \"But, I really will go..\"\n\nK:\"What, u think going to a therapist will make me suddenly have feelings again?\"\n\nMe:\"u don't love m---??\"\n\nK:\"Ugh I'm going to bed\"\n\nMe:\"but..\"\n\nK:\"BED. I have to be up at 6\" (shuts door).\n\nI sent a long msg stating how I fucked up, he was right, I need help, etc and he didn't budge. I left him alone.\n\nApril 3,\u00a0 I contacted every shrink to get a sliding scale appt...and got one for Apr 5th. I did EVERYTHING to improve the quality of my day. I cleaned the kitchen, bathroom, myself, made dinner. Ken came home, and seemed..jubilant &amp; carefree..about his day (normal for him) to his folks. The bizarre thing was him being sparingly nice to me cause I was on my feet. I got 1 text from him \"I'm glad u got an appointment, We'll see how it goes but I want space at home\". Apr 4th, much the same.\n\nFriday was my appt. I talked all about my past, childhood, fears, and Ken. I picked my fingers till they bled I was so nervous. The therapist mentioned PTSD/Somatoform Disorder and I was scheduled for that next friday too. When I got home, Ken was there. He started talking to me finally and I took that as a green light. He was glad I went..but wary. He wanted to see how things go. He then spontaneously told me then that he started talking to Sara again. I was dying inside. He literally handed me his phone and said i can look at the msgs. (FYI, he's ALWAYS been open with his phone to me and made it clear if I was ever unsure I could look).\n\nS: Why the request now?\n\nK: i wanted to apologize for the loss of it. Long story\n\nK: Sarah was worried I had feelings for u, and what she saw on our FB chat was confirmation enough for her. She snooped through my chats/texts. She wanted to 'test' me to prove I wouldnt leave her so she made a fake 'Sara' email.\n\nWhich was ridiculous. I knew how u felt about a relationship, she didn't. It was too much for her that we be friends. I had convos with her which she provoked me claiming u sent her these msgs. That pissed me off and she got the response she wanted. That I dont speak to u again. I didn't want to start conflict so I agreed not to contact u. It wasnt till before the wedding that I saw the acct she made. I thought, do I call this crazy thing off even though we put money into it or live with it? And that's the decision I made, obviously not a good one.\n\nS: So why tell me after all this time? Are u still married to her? Someone who would lie and hurt someone like that? u don't know how bad that hurt\"\n\nK: I'm sorry, I told her we're done. I wanted to apologize sooner but I didnt want her to see. IDC what she sees now.\n\nS: I actually feel sick. How many times have I tried to get u to listen to me? That chick is bag of crazy! I dwelled for months cause my friend didnt believe me.\n\nK: Yeah, it made me sick to find out she played me &amp; what I said as a result. I don't want her in my life anymore.\n\nS: I almost didnt take u'r friend req. cause I thought it might be her\n\nK: Cant handle this shit. I don't know what I said to u cause I was talking to her. I just never knew if it was really u or not so i didn't.\n\n(And then a bunch of MISC attempts on his end to start up paragraph long pointless convos despite her 1 word replies and many calls to her after work).  \n\n\nI was going to vomit. I walked out to breathe. I asked him to come out to talk with me.\n\nMe:\"that was painful\"\n\nHim: \"yeah, I knew it would be difficult for u\"\n\nMe: \"u told her u contemplated marrying me then?\"\n\nHim: \"Yeah, that was such a big lie u did\"\n\nMe: \"it was, and I told u flat out I did it and was prepared and u let it go..\"\n\nHim: \"well thats cause I already knew. I found it on ur comp before u told me.\"\n\nMe: \" U didn't tell me that\"\n\nMe: Was it true about why u continued with the wedding?\"\n\nHim: \"I did it cause I love u\"\n\nMe: \"U said the money down was a factor in u'r indecisiveness\"\n\nHim: \"Stop. Why do u do that? U always jump to conclusions and not listen.\"\n\nMe: \"Do u really want a divorce?\"\n\nHim: \"I thought about it the other day yeah.\"\n\nMe: \"But, doesnt that even bother u?\"\n\nHim: \"U dont get to ask about my emotions anymore\"\n\nMe: \"okay..I just don't understand. We love each other.\"\n\nHim: \"Lots of divorced people are still in love...\"\n\nHim: \"I want to be with U. I love u. I never wanted it to get to this point, to contemplate divorce. I can't live my life like this! U're going to kill me!(cries) with u refusing help.\"\n\nMe: \"I'm going to someone, I'm really on this. This is it\"\n\nHim: \"I want to see u get help and I want U back\"\n\nThe next few days, he wanted to do things with me. Movies, BBQ, fishing, bargain hunting, Thai dinner, cribbage. He laughed at my jokes, cuddled me, kissed my forehead a lot and smiled at me. It was a good time. I was so glad I had him back, and I was really working on myself, but I couldn't escape how confused I felt over 'how' he talked about me to Sara, the mistake I made, etc.\n\nMe: (literally explained exactly what I said above about when I looked at those msgs, the Hawaii thing, blowing up making a fake acct, feeling bad about it)\n\nMe: \"I told u that I did it and u let it go. I didn't know that u were harbouring this bitterness over it. It hurt to hear u resurface it like I'm some..monster. Like I'm some detested conversation piece.\"\n\nHim: \"Hun, I don't think ur a monster (strokes my arm) I know it was an old mistake.\"\n\nMe: \"Then why tell her part reason is cause u didn't want to risk it being me? That u thought I was still doing this?\"\n\nHim: I don't think u'r 'still' doing it. I only brought it up cause I had to explain to her what happened. If u and I were going to end, my BIGGEST regret that came out of our marriage was not apologizing to Sara for the horrible things I said which she had NO idea about. I don't even have an interest in talking to her hunny, just wanted to apologize.\"\n\nMe: \"When I admitted what I did and u let it go, u told me that u had no interest in talking to her anyway. I eventually believed that cause u always instilled it.\"\n\nHim: \"but, u also told me before that u didn't want me talking to her.\"\n\nMe: \"Well duh! U seem to think that me assuming u had interest in her based off of those texts was unfounded...do u even recall what u texted her?\"\n\nHim: \"Not really..?\"\n\nMe: \"U were half-serious talking about going to Hawaii together..while I'm here! U tried to convince me u wouldnt spend time with her there/do anything with her, u just wanted to get a vaca out of it. That she owed u after the 3k u gave her.\"\n\nHim: \"Oh yeah, I forgot about that..\\*unsure shrug\\*.\"\n\nMe: \"or talking to her about how \"good she's with her fingers ;)\".Saying that's friendly &amp; meant nothing..\"\n\nHim: \"Oh.. \\*Purses lips and starts to giggle\\*\n\nMe: \"It's like----wait..why are u laughing? u think that's funny?\"\n\nHim: (giggling but trying to suppress it--clears his throat)\u00a0 \"I..I don't have a comment.\"\n\nSince then it has been about 2 weeks..and we've been doing everything together, having fun, movies, etc. I've been doing all the house work, making myself pretty, giving him head massages, ASMR, dinners, u name it. About 3ish days ago my therapist suggested I write a single question down for him in a book per day for him to read at his discretion, and for him to do the same if he wants. Great idea and Ken was all for it. That day I asked him this:\n\nQ: This morning I said something about  having other partners that was misconstrued I think. U'r response was \"\\*chuckle\\* so now I can, when u said I wasn't allowed to\". I'm confused, did u want another partner? I thought we established we only want eachother. Just want clarification?\"\n\nKen: \"Monogamy means I only want u as a partner sexually + emotionally.  I'll work on re-defining what I expect and hope for in a partner\"\n\nI looked at his response and said ...\"this doesn't answer my question at all..\"\n\nKen: \"It is clear as crystal right there\"\n\nMe: \"O....kay?\"\n\nKen: \"Hun, we agreed to a monogamous relationship together, that is what we have. I don't want to look for anyone else, be with anyone else....\"\n\nMe: \"Okay, that makes sense. I've just been on edge lately with all that has been going on, I don't understand. I feel like I'm walking on eggshells and I'm scared u are always one foot out the door while u hold me close. (then a small convo about how he'd been thinking of divorce the other week, not understanding how he wanted to never see me again...etc)\n\nKen: \"Hun...look at me \\*holds my hands\\* I love u more than anyone, I mean, u made me change my mind on marriage lol..I'll never love anyone as much as I love u . But, if u didn't get the help, u WERE dead to me. If u go back to how u were, u ARE dead to me. Do u understand? I'll always love u , that'll never change. It's like, I love my grandma, but she's dead and never coming back...it's like that. Of course, if u got better/got the help, then I would reach out to u again cause obviously u aren't 'dead' lol. Do u understand what I said?\" \n\nMe: \"....yes. Was it really that bad? We had such uniquely amazing times. U always said I was the 1..\"\n\nKen: \"...If I'm not the 1 for u, then u aren't the 1 for me (wtf does that mean?) I was faking it those times, if u had looked up from ur phone, u'd see that\"\n\nMe: \"Faking it? How long?\"\n\nKen: \"Since u started this anxiety thing in Nov. It wasn't 'all' fake then, but few and far between amazing times. Now I'm going to work on that list of what I look for in a partner and u can read okay?\" \n\nI read his list and it was literally the most standard list. I think he googled it and wrote it actually. Self sufficiency, selflessness, helping, humor (which is one of my biggest traits), listening, etc. \n\nThat night we went to the club, and he sat just to watch me dance and just smiled at me. We had a lot of fun, of course I was still butthurt, but I let it go for the night. When I got off the floor, he complimented how radiantly beautiful I'm when I dance.. which felt nice. I was drunk and all I remember saying in the car was \"I'm worthless, and u are great. It's my fault, I'm sorry\" and him saying \"oh hunny a lot was ur parents. It isn't all ur fault. U know u are the love of my life\". For the next few days I took him to a fancy restaurant, fishing, all these places...buying him things, apologizing for dry dinner cause I tried BBQing for the first time, apologizing all the time for small things or habits to the point where he's like \"Hunny (kisses forehead), u can stop apologizing for everything all the time. I don't want \"Apologetic\" u... that WAS in my list of partner requirements. Just be  u \\^\\_\\^ I love u\". So now I'm trying to level that out while fixing my anxiety, fixing my habits, not getting angry or questioning. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI don't really have a specific question other than...what is ur take on all of this? Should I even still be bothered by this stuff ..cause I'm, and I don't know if it is unfounded or what", "subreddit": "lonely"}

In walks this Asian girl, who I presumed to be his girlfriend, and after giggling at each other for a little while, they started holding hands and went into a full on kissing session right in front of me. The line was pretty slow, so for the next 2 or 3 minutes I stood there super awkwardly and watched this guy publicly make out and neck his girlfriend two feet away from me.\n\nI pretended to look away and at something on the shelf until he bought his item and finally left with her. I feel like this kind of stuff is becoming more and more common in public. I couldn't help but die a little inside with jealousy.

I'm 15,  I was huge friends (basically brothers) with 2 kids my age. We went to the same school of course,  we had almost the same taste in our future, music,  clothes,  girls,  that sorta thing. This group was named \"Trimigos\" (almost makes me cry saying the name now).  We did literally everything together.  Got pizza,  went trick or treating, went over each other's houses,  fucked around in each other's neighborhoods.  I think you get the gist of everything. So around this time it would be the beginning of March.  I've just come out of a terrible breakup (might do that one soon idk), I wake up and get ready for school and I realize that one of my friends (lets call him T) took \"Trimigos\" out of his instagram bio.  We all had it in our bios for whatever reason. I text him and ask if everything is okay and he responds like \"yea just pissed\".  I thought nothing of it so I brushed it off my shoulder.  I didn't see him at all at school which I normally would see him around 5th passing period. So I thought maybe he was sick or just wasn't in the mood for school. I text him and ask him if he's pissed at me since it was passed on to me by a friend that he was.  I found out that a rumor was spread to him that I ratted him out for burning his ex's painting when she wanted it back.  I was quick to deny it because the only person I told was our other friend in our Trimigos group. So no I'm pissed cause T is pissed at me,  doesn't wanna be friends and I end up texting my other friends girlfriend (lets call C).  So C and I get into a small fight over something small I think and at the time like I said I was pissed so I ended up being a huge dick and saying (fuck you and fuck your relationship).  Worst. mistake. ever.  I didn't mean it as I hated her relationship.  I meant it as I didn't wanna be involved in it but that's not what T took it as when he saw what I said.

The rest of the guys on the table burst out laughing and especially found it funny that my name was on the list. \n\n\u2022 Throughout school and sometimes outside of school too, I'd have guys come up to me and say \"my friend thinks you're fit\" or \"you're so fit please go out with me\"\u00a0 to make fun of me. \n\n\u2022 Guys nudging their friends (in school and outside of school) and saying \"that's your girlfriend\" and laughing. \n\n\u2022 I used to hear people gossiping about me by calling me ugly and saying I'm weird. (I was weird, but they mentioned my looks too because I'm ugly.)\n\n\u2022 Guys would pull my hair, push me while I walked or they'd fart on me or throw stones at my back while I walked home from school. This didn't happen that often and it might not seem directly linked to my looks, but why else would they do it? I never saw them treat pretty and average looking girls in this way. I never even saw them treat my socially outcast friends this way because my friends were more attractive than me. \n\n\u2022 Being reverse cat called. This is where I would walk down a street and a group of guys would say \"hey sexy\" or \"hey hottie\" and then start laughing. They aren't catcalling me because they find me attractive,\u00a0 they're doing it because it's meant to be funny or ironic to call an ugly girl \"hot.\" It's very obvious they were trying to mock me. This doesn't mean I want to be catcalled for being attractive,\u00a0 I just don't want anyone to bother me while I'm trying to walk down the street. This is something that happens to me fairly often by the way and I'm an adult now and the guys doing it are adults too and should know better. \n\n\u2022 Having people say \"she was so ugly\" after I walk past them on the street. It's obvious they're talking about me because they look at me and there's not a lot of other people walking past them while I am. Maybe I'm just being paranoid and they aren't talking about me, but I doubt it. \n\n\u2022 At family events, i have aunties say that I'm too ugly or too fat for marriage and no man would want a girl who looks like me. This has only happened a few times but it shows that I really am unattractive. \n\n\u2022 The boy I fancied in year 9 called my name in lesson once and I got excited but then he just told me I look like the supply teacher. He was mocking the supply teacher for the way she looked minutes before he said this to me. \n\n\u2022 This popular guy in year 9 took an unflattering picture of me while I was laughing and set it as his background on Ask.fm. People were commenting on his page saying they liked his background or straight up saying that his background was ugly or scary. \n\n\u2022 The same popular guy used to take videos of me sneezing or something and put them on Snapchat.\n\n\u2022 If there were ever photographers in school, they would try to crop me out of photos for the school website, brochures and newsletters. For example, I was sat on a table once with this girl next to me and the photographer kept asking me to move further left (so i would be out of the shot)\u00a0 and he was directing the camera right towards the girl sat next to me. He then asked for that girl's name (so he could ask her parents permission to put that picture of her on the table -where I'm cropped out- on the school website) and made her do more pictures without me sat on the table.\n\nI can't really think of more examples right now but there probably are more. \nSo what about other people on this sub,\u00a0 which experiences led you to realise you were considered unattractive by people?", "subreddit": "ForeverAlone"}

I'm an introvert with possible Asperger's or mental illness, which means my standards for friendship are a bit high and it's impossibly hard for me to make friends. The few attempts I make to have friends end in ghosting, and people have also expressed that my timid personality will attract abusive people, which I can't really argue against.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI have 3 sort of friends, 2 of which I once regarded as best friends. I used to think they were nice and loyal and interesting and perfect, but as time went on I realised just how unreliable they were. And no matter what I do for them and what sacrifices I make, they can't give the same amount of loyalty back. It's shattered me inside, because therapists sometimes think I'm a bit of a naive dummy and can't tell fake friendship apart from real friendship. But it wasn't like that, we were like sisters, we stayed in each other's social circle after high school and after college. But I now have to accept that my idea of the ideal friendship (which my therapists say include standards that everyone should meet) might not exist.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTherapy has ceased to make me feel better for long. For the longest time I couldn't afford real therapy and had to rely on the free services at college and university. Now that I can afford a few sessions, with the therapist's suggestion I immediately made a beeline for getting an Asperger's test. Because knowing a lot about how mental illness and therapy works, it's clear to me that depression and anxiety can be effectively treated without an official diagnoses, but Asperger's is quite different.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo if the test says false, I'll either try to just function on my own, or go to therapy sessions every once in a while, for my wallet and for my time. Because I've been feeling that in my personal case, even professional therapy is quite useless without external validation from friends or family. Inside of me and everyone who's abused and abandoned and downtrodden, there's the irreversable trauma of being hated  and hurt by those who were supposed to love you. My family likes to play happy families both inside and outside the home, but they are anything but. There's been fighting, things getting broken, arguments, physical altrications, threats to call the police, and just general closed-mindedness and denial towards any percieved negativity.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo in all this, I've realised that I do better when I'm forced to create relationships with co-workers which then grow into friendships. Then again, I've only had one job before, but I've been wondering whether it might be the key for having some sort of social life. I hope to teach TEFL and later graduate as an English teacher. I can only hope that by being forced to interact with collegues I'll make some friends and have some sort of social life. But I know that it's not going to be much, and that I'll have way too much time on my own anyway. I'm trying to fill that alone time by writing the many books I have planned (you know how 'writing' goes), but I'm afraid that I've gotten addicted to it. I've become addicted to the feeling of weightlessness as I'm really into a scene and writing like crazy, to the point where when it's over I become irritable and looking forward to my next fix. I've never been addicted to anything in my life and I don't want to be. So I don't want suggestions for weed and that sort.\n\nI can only donate blood for a good cause every 4 months, I can only give stuff I don't need to charity as I can't volunteer because it would emotionally exhaust me and I'm no good at socialising. I've considered intellectual persuits and I dream of learning a bit of Italian and Arabic, but that's all it is: intellectual. What good is intelligence if you don't share it with someone or contribute to society with it? Otherwise I don't know what else I can do. I don't think I'll ever be emotionally ready to date, especially the trial that is internet dating. Either way I'll end up just wasting money on a relationship that will eventually break down. I consider that some day I'll get tired of waiting and choose to lose my virginity to a prostitute of my choosing and who knows what they're doing.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIn general, I can only work at being average on the outside, but alone and worthless on the inside.

Maaan it really sucks being ugly, especially as a girl. But for all of you ugly people out there, we just have to try our best to improve our appearance. I started wearing makeup and the difference it makes is huuuuge. I'm also gonna get plastic surgery. And I'm investing lots of time in skincare and overall body health, nutrition exercise etc. Also hair products, styling, clothes, etc... And personality, smiling a lot, etc hahaha. I sound so stupid saying all of this. I don't even know why I'm saying this. But yeah, as an ugly girl, your value is completely brushed aside... guys don't respect me at all, they don't look at me... it's really sad because I'm just a normal girl, you know? I want other people to be happy, I want the world to be a better place, I try to improve myself and to be kind to others. But because I was born ugly, I'm never enough, you know? Really really strange... And like, both of my parents were really attractive when they were young, and my younger brother is also really attractive, idk what happened to me, genetic chance I guess... But yeah I just wanted to tell my fellow uglies that we can always find ways to improve our appearance, in 99% of cases we can improve something, it's worth it to save up money for plastic surgery if necessary, especially girls, because I'm telling you, society cares so much about beauty. If you're an average girl it's not necessary at all but if you're genuinely ugly, plastic surgery and other strategies can improve your quality of life so much. Lmaoo this sounds like a plastic surgery ad, sorry.. all I'm trying to say is that there's room for improvement and we can't give up. Feeling so much rejection, from others and myself, makes me suicidal sometimes... it really carves a deep deep wound into your soul because it's not about superficial stuff of looking aesthetically pleasing, it's about lacking acceptance, respect, affection, love and purpose. Anyway girls and guys, we can't give up. Just keep swimming man. Life's a huge bitch and sometimes you feel like you can't deal with it anymore but we just have to keep moving forward no matter what. I just assume that it's a constant uphill battle, sometimes I just view it as a videogame hahaha, like bring it on bitchhhhh, let's see how hard you can hit me. Anyway if any of you feel really really lonely and just need someone to care, you can PM me cuz I'm good at caring, and I care about you even if no one else does. I don't guarantee I can sustain a convo for long because I'm quite busy but I will gladly listen to you, hear you out, or lend a helping hand if I can. We have to help each other man.

I felt like I was never going to get rid of it. I've had severe social anxiety since my first day of high school. It's made me hopeless and at the same time, I was addicted video games. All I cared about during my youth was video games, nothing else. It was my escape from the real world and the only thing that I enjoyed. I'm not 100% sure what caused my social anxiety, but I'm thinking it was my video game addiction. I hardly left the house. I only left to go to school and then straight back home. I noticed that after every summer, my anxiety worsened. I wasn't that depressed, probably because I was able to escape away to video games.\n\nI was too afraid to seek help, and my mom is to blame. Her only response is \"Just talk to people and stop being shy!\". Also, she is against anxiety medication and didn't want to spend money for me to see a therapist or psychiatrist. \n\nSo, I continued to cope with it.. There was nothing I could do. I stayed closeted in my room every day. I didn't even attend prom or any events. \n\nNow I don't even enjoy video games anymore, because now, I care more about doing something more productive, travelling to cool places, being in a relationship, and so on. However, what debilitated me the most is never having been in a relation and having no experience in sex.\n\nI grew up in a very religious and sexually repressed family. As a result, I thought sex before marriage was bad and that I should avoid it. I was too closeted to know most of my peers are getting action and that at my age, not having had sex or a relationship was weird. I got so depressed knowing that and my world turned darker.

(a story)", "author": "Fixed_Assets", "self_text": "Back in the summer of 2003, I ended up meeting a girl online.  This was way before the prevalence of picture-focused dating apps.  In all honest, I actually can't recall exactly what site I met her on since it was so long ago.  But we ended up texting, chatting and emailing pretty frequently and she was very impressed with how clever and witty I was behind the keyboard (as people often are :D)  She made it pretty clear that she was interested in me beyond just being friends, which was all good by me since, at that time, the only experience I had with women was a prom date who ditched me once she got there to hang out with her friends.\n\nAnyway, I found out she went to high school with my best (and only) friend at the time so I was able to get a picture of her to see what she looked like.  She was a pretty plain looking short-haired brunette, but that is kinda my thing so I had no issues so far.  She stil didn't know what I looked like and back then, I didn't have a digital camera or a camera phone, so wasn't easy to find a picture to send to her.  She was fine with that and eventually she agreed to meet with me at the video store where I worked.  She was bringing a friend too to make sure things didn't get weird and I was fine with that.\n\nI texted her because she said she'd meet me for lunch and she said she was on her way, but after that, I didn't hear anything.  Lunch came and went and I didn't hear anything.  I texted her a couple of times to make sure nothing happened (wasn't in a car accident or anything like that) but got no responses.  Eventually, I decided to let it go and figured that for whatever reason, she couldn't make it.\n\nThen one of my co-workers said that he did see a girl with her friend who asked about me and that he pointed me out to the two ladies - and that they promptly bailed shortly thereafter without saying hello (or, consequently, goodbye).  I also later heard from her friend (about a year later) that basically she left because I \"wasn't what she was expecting,\" and that she was sorry about this.  I supposed no other explanation is necessary.\n\nI never heard from her again.  I guess she's the lucky one though because she was able to get out of a date with a guy she obviously wasn't attracted to without the mess of a rejection or an awkward obligatory date before ghosting.\n\nSo here is my tribute to you, chickie, for being a stand up girl (who stood me up, lol).

I was on a little movie marathon. I had watched a great music movie called \"That Thing You Do!\", and then I went to Netflix to watch two more movies. These last two movies were what made me realize this big reason for my depression. I first watched a movie I loved as a child, that movie being \"Monster House\", and then I watched \"Coraline\" for the first time. I know, an odd choice of movies to have a mental breakdown over. Well, both movies involve young, pre-teen protagonists. They all go on their own little adventures, and all that dumb stuff. Your average movie for kids and teens. They're both amazing movies, by the by. But, after I watched them, I went to use the restroom, and once I had finished, I sort of stared in the mirror for a while, thinking and reflecting about both the movies and my life. And, after a while, I realized that I never had the chance to be a kid. I never had the chance to live out a normal childhood. I've always been impoverished, not horribly, but enough to almost always be on the edge of financial crisis. My parents have always been divorced, and my father and some other family members are horrible people. My mom sheltered the hell out of me, so I never gained social skills or friends. I had a verbally and physically abusive stepfather for years during my childhood. And the list goes on and on. And, come to think of it, it helps me put everything into perspective. How I get upset over anime, and kids films, and cartoons. Stuff of that sort. It also explains why I can be so immature. I'm sixteen, I've never had a childhood, and because of that, I'm deathly afraid of growing up. It all makes sense. It all makes goddamn sense and I hate that it does. I'm breaking down over it. I'm crying and shaking like a madman. I am NEVER able to goddamn cry, not even at goddamm funerals, and here I am, crying and shaking like some baby. I want to kill myself. The first nearly two decades of my life were wasted. I wish I just had a normal childhood. I don't want to be a goddsmn mental case. I want friends. I want social skills. I want to be able to think back to fond childhood memories and say \"Heh, those were the times\". Instead, all of it is goddamn foggy because my brain blocked it out or something. I can hardly think back to Middle school. I can't handle this sudden realization. I just can't. Its past 3 am and I'm a goddamn wreck. My life will never be normal or happy, will it?

If you took some time out of your day to even read this it would mean a lot to me.\n\nI used to have friends. I used to have love interests, but I never had a girlfriend or anything.

Little bit long though.\n\nSome sad stuff for context though, the last year of my life has been pretty miserable. I had always struggled with some stuff, but I had one really great friend who was able to help me out. Sadly towards the end of 2017 she started having a lot of health problems because of very severe asthma and a drug addiction, and in March 2018 she passed away after a severe asthma attack that made her go into cardiac arrest. I just felt completely broken after I found out what happened, I wish I could've done more to help her. Making it harder, she also wasn't responding to messages from most people those final couple of months, so I didn't realize how bad things were until it was too late. The last time I ever saw her was Thanksgiving Eve 2017 and the last time she was actively responding to texts was right before Christmas, so I went 3 months with no clue what was going on and just wondering if she was okay.\n\nSo, 2018 ended up being a year where my mind was stuck on one very painful moment and thousands of little things related to it. I am doing better now, but that pain will always be there.\n\nIn November 2018 though I found something that ended up helping me out. I was watching some stuff on Twitch and I found one of the smaller streams on there where the host was someone who clearly cared about all of the people who regularly tuned in and she spent a lot of time trying to get to know everyone. I enjoyed it right away, it was nice having kind of a relaxing place online to hang out in and talk to people. She plays different games with everyone outside of the stream too, mostly PC stuff and my laptop can't run that stuff (mainly Overwatch) very well but I've been able to play Smash Ultimate with her and a few other people from the group. The first time I've really had friends to play any of the Smash games with! \n\nNow going to my birthday, the usual plan each year is just going out for dinner at a steak place with my mom and dad. Its something I enjoy, but it is hard not having many people that would be interested in doing something with me. The thing I always looked forward to the most was that my best friend would try to make it out to join us for dinner even if her schedule was packed, but she is gone now and knowing that makes it tougher to enjoy the dinner. Last year I was still so messed up during my birthday and didn't feel like celebrating at all but my parents made me go so I didn't just sleep all day.\n\nThis year I was trying to figure out if there was anything else I could do, and during one of those twitch streams I was watching I asked the host if we could play a few rounds of Smash Ultimate after I got back from dinner and she said of course (also sang happy birthday to me and one of the other viewers who had one that week). Normally I would just sit around in the my room after we get home from dinner, but this time I was able to get on the Switch and there was an open room with the host and a couple of the other people from the stream and play for a couple hours while chatting on Discord. Its not something big, but still it makes me feel good that I found this little community to hang out in online where a few people would take the time to play some games online with me on my birthday.\n\nAlso, I was playing as ZSS, she was Joker. My first time playing on his stage and I loved the art style for it, she highly recommended Persona 5 and we spent some time talking about how I need to get it if the rumors are true and it gets ported to the Switch.\n\nJust a fun night.\n\n**TL;DR** - Normally my birthdays are very lonely, been struggling a lot after a friend passed away a year ago, but this year I got to spend a couple hours playing games and talking with a few friends from a Twitch stream who were nice enough to take that time to play with me.", "subreddit": "lonely"}

I\u2019m 26 and I haven\u2019t gone on a single date or even been asked out. I\u2019m at the age where everyone I know is either married, engaged, or in a long term relationship and the ones who aren\u2019t are just interested in hooking up until something good comes along. I use to try to talk about it with my friends but they didn\u2019t understand and would just give me platitudes or just be dismissive. I\u2019ve tried to open up and be completely honest about how I felt unloved, unwanted, that I felt invisible and insignificant. My friends would tell me that I\u2019ll find someone someday, or it\u2019ll happen when I\u2019m ready, or that my dog loves me, or to love myself first. I\u2019ve had people offer advice that I should pretty much completely change myself to attract someone or that I should casually have sex until it turns into a relationship. Besides my loneliness and depression I love and accepted myself. I don\u2019t want to become someone I\u2019m not just be loved, especially when I know there are people worst than me who have no trouble finding someone to love them. I also know that there are people who waited patiently like everyone says and now they\u2019re in their 30\u2019s, 40\u2019s, and even 50\u2019s and they\u2019re still alone and waiting. I saw a clip of a woman on a talk show say she was still a virgin at 50 because she was taught to wait until marriage to have sex and she\u2019s still waiting. I\u2019ve tried tinder and okcupid and all I got were people interested in just having sex with me and people so desperate to be with someone they didn\u2019t care if I didn\u2019t find them attractive or interesting they just wanted to be in a relationship. I almost tried eharmony and match until a friend said the messages she\u2019s got where just as bad as tinder. I\u2019ve tried dressing up and looking cute and being funny every time I go out in hopes that someone would make a move on me. I\u2019ve shameless thrown myself at few guys and even hung-out with someone I wasn\u2019t attracted to because I thought he at least had a nice personality but turns out he didn\u2019t have a car and was just interested in me bringing beer over. My loneliness is becoming so obvious that my mom\nand siblings have been commenting that I must be lonely with how much I\u2019m hanging over there.\n\nMy screen time for last week was down 34% because a new app on Facebook let people send anonymous messages to their friends and my single friends were getting messages about how attractive they are and from people confessing their crushes or even just they\u2019re sexual attraction. They were getting dozens of messages a day I got four total. My four messages were asking me to play a sonic the hedgehog app on my phone (I don\u2019t even like these kinds of games), asking what I thought of a sonic hedgehog music video and what my favorite Pok\u00e9mon was, and my celebrity crush. I know that 3 out 4 came from a girl who I use to ride the bus with I\u2019m hs, she confessed her feelings for a friend to me and I set them up and they dated for a year or so but I haven\u2019t had much contact with either of them since leaving hs. She apparently sent the same questions to a bunch of people so its not like I was special.  The whole thing just made me feel like shit. \n\nI just want everyone else has. I know the above has been about wanting a relationship but I also want better friendships too. Friends who don\u2019t show they care by roasting me, and friends who aren\u2019t dismissive of my feelings, friend who invite me out because they want my company instead of inviting me out because they feel like they somehow owe me for being there for them when they were single. I\u2019d like to have friends who message me first to actually chat about stuff other than sending memes I don\u2019t like but look at and react to because I feel like I have to  and I\u2019d like to be a better friend too.", "subreddit": "lonely"}

Of course, it is my fault and I didn't work as hard as I could but my major issues is on weekends, when I have a little more relaxation time and my mind wanders into the territory of loneliness. It drains me, I lay in bed for hours, either listening to sad music, watching videos or rummaging through omegle to find people to talk to and get my mind of things. Hours I could have spent studying. Hours I could have spent enjoying playing a game or something I like rather than feeling miserable.

Or if this message will reach you at all... But, I just feel empty inside. I think the strength that people gain from being resolute in their solitude is a dangerous one. Constantly killing the natural urge to interact with others. That might be what they call depression. It\u2019s actually a bit sick, the way one can enable themselves to be a recluse within their own mind. I feel more vulnerable to myself than anyone else. I think someday I will move on from thinking about you, but I still can\u2019t help it. I don\u2019t know if you\u2019re the same person I knew or not, or even if you don\u2019t want to be the same person I knew. I\u2019d like to think that we could still be on the same wavelength as individuals. I\u2019m not really hung up on \u201cwhat we had\u201d or \u201cour old friendship\u201d. I just miss you as an individual. As a person who strives to look at things as what they actually are, it can get lonely. The social buffers and handicaps that enables everyone else to connect with each other, are absent for me. Part of me thinks it\u2019s wrong to think that they\u2019re \u201cbuffers\u201d and \u201chandicaps\u201d and that I should be less judgmental. The other wants to \u201csee things as they truly are, and have a clear view of the world\u201d in hopes of justifying who I am. Whoever that is. I still don\u2019t know. I\u2019d like to think that I know, and I can certainly tell you what I\u2019m not. But a lot of the time, I look in the mirror and at that instant, none of it means anything anymore. I think the reason you have lasted in my thoughts this long is because you gave me a reason to live. I hope this doesn\u2019t come across as a pathetic plea of desperation for you to care about me again. I simply mean that back then I existed for someone else\u2019s existence. I knew that if I were to vanish, someone would feel my absence. My importance relative to the other things in your life is something that I often question. Sometimes I\u2019ll think,  \u201cdo they hope to accidentally run into me, like I do?\u201d or \u201cdo they still think about me?\u201d. Sometimes I even wonder if my role was even that significant, or if you\u2019ve moved easily on simply because the void that I left in your life was easily fillable. At this point, you may have even become an exaggerated figment of my imagination, an individual more surreal than you actually are. Along with clarity, I think things observed in retrospect are often subject to images that are easier for the mind to digest. It\u2019s been a while.

To be clear, I\u2019m not rich, my net worth is $150,000, but when I was a teenager I always thought $100,000 was an unbelievable amount of money. \n\nI\u2019m still forever alone, that saddens me. I still feel the same as when I was a teenager. I even still play the same video games I played in high school. I always thought if I had money I\u2019d somehow be different, but I\u2019m not. I\u2019m still just me. I still feel the same. I\u2019m still a forever aloner, except now I have a little bit of money.  \n\nHowever, money has given me the confidence to go to graduate school to never again work in customer service. Money has allowed me to constantly fantasize about what I *could* buy or where I *could* travel. Just knowing that I have the money to do it is enough for me. Money also acted as a catalyst in terms of me seeing an expensive escort. Money in my humble opinion does in fact buy happiness. Or at the very least prevents many miserable experiences like being stuck in a cruddy job. \n\nTruth be told, if I didn\u2019t have money, I\u2019m not sure what I\u2019d do. I owe Satoshi Nakamoto, the creator of Bitcoin a lot.\n\nIn terms of how I made my money at 23, it\u2019s mainly luck but also shrewd risk-taking. It took years of applying from ages 16-18 when I finally found my first job. I overheard some classmates talking about Bitcoin in 2013, that\u2019s how I learned of it. I decided to \u201clive a little\u201d and started sporadically buying it from 2015-2017 while working menial low-wage jobs. I decided it had gone up an insane amount and it was time to sell most of it in very early 2018. I still hold some today. I\u2019ve also tried my luck with individual stocks.

Working from home has many perks, but the main disadvantages turned out to be the feeling of loneliness, disconnection and depression. It's a strange feeling knowing that you desperately need to talk to someone, but you can't.  \n\n\nWhen I was feeling depressed, I couldn't find a place to privately talk to a person to discuss my issues and maybe help someone with their issues. I found regular chats unhelpful because I couldn't feel any connection with people I was communicating with. I found some video chats, but they were (and still are) crowded with people having really weird intentions - you cannot discuss anything without chances of seeing someone naked.  \n\n\nI thought that I was not the only person having such problems and decided to create a place where people could just talk about anything they want.  \n\n\nFast forward couple of years later - I am fine, I work at the office and social connections help me be positive and stay afloat. I've managed to create the website where people can just talk - it took me 2 attempts and more than 2.5 years to complete. It is designed to be safe and meaningful: video is turned off, and people can choose which topics to discuss and whether they want the discussion to be regular (nickname + userpic is shown) or private (no nicknames shown).  \n\n\nCurrently, I'm in the process of collecting list of early users - I wouldn't want to open website today and see visitors go away because they don't see anyone online.  \n\n\nI thought that probably some of you would be interested in joining because I see a lot of people here willing to talk.   \n\n\nI'll leave the link in the first comment to this post, you are more than welcome to join.", "subreddit": "lonely"}

Any stories like mine?", "author": "NobodyKnows2345", "self_text": "First, let me just say that the aim of this post is not to brag or invalidate anyone's experiences - I truly just feel incredibly alone and am hoping to find anyone who can relate to my situation or at least listen to my story.\n\nI am a 23 year old male who is soon to graduate from one of the top 4 Ivies (won't say which) and move to California to start a prestigious job in my field. I have a very active social life, lots of friends in different spheres (home, college, work, etc.) and a great relationship with my family. People have always known me as gregarious, funny, and intelligent, and it's never been hard for me to talk to anyone, girls or otherwise. Despite this, and in fact perhaps because of it, nobody knows how truly alone I am and have always been.\n\nI'll be the first to admit that I'm below-average in looks. I'm short, unathletic and a little pudgy, and don't have a great face. Over the past few years, though, I've gone from thinking I'm a 5-6 to thinking I must be a solid 3-4 or worse, because I've never had a relationship or hooked up with anyone in college, and the last (and only) time I kissed a girl was 6 years ago and she more or less did it to be nice after I took her on an expensive and romantic date (I suspect, though don't know for sure, that one of my buddies told her I had never kissed anyone before and she may have felt bad about that as well). I've never even held a girl's hand romantically. Very very occasionally, someone will match with me on Tinder or express what seems like interest, but at some point all of them seem to snap out of it and lose interest (I'm not even being metaphorical here, I swear I've seen this switch go off and their faces change in the middle of a date or after flirting at a party). I have never ever been approached by a girl or been told that someone has a crush on me or even thought I was cute.\n\nFor the first three years of college, I really tried. I've gone on like 3 dates total which went fantastically but then went nowhere, had a handful of Tinder conversations that went nowhere without ever being fantastic, and never got farther than grinding with a girl at a party. I had plenty of crushes that I was too scared to act on, and two that I worked up the courage to try, but the end result was the same. This constant lack of success, both in-person and especially on dating apps, slowly poisoned my life and was so stressful and disheartening that I decided to abandon romantic pursuits entirely, and that's where I've been at since. It worked insofar as I generally feel much freer and don't waste time and resources trying to chase romance, and I would say on a day-to-day basis I'm quite happy with my decision. However, I can't escape the feelings of intense loneliness and dread that manifest themselves every night when I'm alone, or the insecurity and sadness I constantly have over feeling so incredibly ugly and having been rejected my entire life, or the wild swings I have between complete emotional detachment from the idea of romance/intimacy, active disgust at the prospect of being in a relationship or needing someone else in my life, and periods of intensely spiking emotions, particularly infatuation with girls I know. For the most part I can't even watch romance movies anymore because I just think of how alien the idea of affection or love is to me and it triggers me into all these dark thoughts.\n\nI've told a few of my closer friends and family about some of these issues, but no one knows all of it. They generally try to tell me the same things: I'm not ugly, anyone would be lucky to have me, someone is out there, etc. etc. But the fact of the matter is I've never believed them and I've never seen any evidence to support their assertions, which I know are just kind words coming from people who want to make me feel better. I know that I have a lot to offer, and I can say without arrogance I have a lot of great qualities, but everything in my life thus far has shown me that when it comes to attraction, all of that is far outweighed by my physical appearance. I haven't talked about it to anyone extensively because I feel so guilty in general burdening anyone with my problems, and more specifically feel pathetic and dumb for having problems like these. I feel I am so blessed and lucky to have what I have and it could be so much worse, and I shouldn't be so ungrateful and self-pitying about it. I also don't think any of them would understand (which is part of why I'm posting here).\n\nCan anyone relate to any of this, or share some stories of their experiences being a (pseudo)-secret FA?", "subreddit": "ForeverAlone"}

If he failed to get self-esteem within his family he carries this same failure out into society. From the outset of his social life outside the family he does not have the talents necessary to give meaning to the cultural game, to inflate and sustain others by providing conviction and forceful cues for them. Being a poor player at the start he never can feel comfortable with a skill he doesnt have. Every social encounter becomes a painful stimulus to an acute self-consciousness. And so the individual may withdraw into himself more and more, since he gets no satisfactory image of himself in society. When he does step out into society he will do so on its terms and never on his own, he always fears to claim his just share of the social mana which everyone is generating.

I just wanted to share my astounding achievement:  Today I achieved the fabled rank of 40 year old virgin!  Like many of you, I have never kissed a girl nor been in any sort of relationship.  From a young age I knew I was different, even as people gave me the same shitty meme advice year after year.  I did have some things going for me:  I'm tall, from a middle-class background, and not hideous.  I'm also straight and white, which I'm under the impression gives me a bit of a leg up too.  If that's true, God help the rest of you.  It's been a long journey to get to this point, so I present to you The Highlight Reel!  (Ages are pulled from memory and are therefore approximated.  Likewise some details will obviously be absent)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAge 15:  For those who believe in destiny, this one's for you!  One day I was annoyed at the antics of the people I shared a lunch table with (I didn't eat with friends, as I had none), so I moved myself to an empty table elsewhere in the cafeteria.  There a girl approached me and asked if she could sit there.  Conversation ensues, then she asks if such and such was my number.  Some prankster had carved my name and phone number onto the lunch table.  I confirmed that it was.  We talked on the phone a couple times after that.  Not only did I not know how to seal the deal, I didn't even realize that she was into me until 10+ years later.  The lesson here is:  Even if cosmic forces bring you and \"the one\" together, a FA will still find a way to fuck it up.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAge 20:  I worked with a cute girl.  I liked her.  I tried to bury my feelings because I didn't want to face rejection.  Apparently she had some sort of superpower as I was simply being friendly when she decided to volunteer her thoughts on me:  \"I don't like you in that way.\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAge 21:  My friends and acquaintances noticed this one girl was always smiling at me and tried to convince me that she was into me.  Skeptical, I mustered the courage to ask her out anyway.  It still stung harshly when she told me she had a boyfriend.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAge 22:  Girl wonders why I'm so negative all the time.  She offers to take me on a pity date if I can refrain from being negative for an entire day.  Doing so was not significantly difficult.  A date!  I'm on the board!  Of course, pity can only carry you so far.  When I ran into her years later she was married and had a child.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAge 23:  A sister to one of my friends took pity on me and said that if I was still a virgin at 25 she would have sex with me.  Like many of you, sex isn't the primary drive in the race to escape crushing loneliness.  I tried to be something more for her, but obviously I suck at such things.  Eventually she and her brother started avoiding me.  He told me I \"came on too strong.\"  Well, shit, thanks for giving me a heads up before it was too late.  Like so many other attempts, trying only made it worse.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAge 25 to 35:  A blackhole of failure and depression from which no hope can escape.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAge 36:  Oh my god, someone finally tried to introduce me to someone!  You know how amazing it is that normies have all these friends that have all these friends and family members but not a single one of them is available.  Anyway, this girl was too young for me from a social norm stand point (she was in her early 20s) but fuck if I care about what other people thought of me at this point.  But as luck would have it, she had already dated an older man in her past and there was all sorts of drama with her family about it.  So instead she dated a lesbian ex-con.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAge 39:  My \"friends\" decide to go on vacation during my birthday, leaving me all alone.  I get it in my head to make one last push to find someone.  I sign up for speed dating.  It was as successful as you'd think.  But at least as long as no one selects you (which surprisingly only took 4 months, I was expecting a lifetime membership!) your next session is free.  When I ran out of free sessions, I was about to give up entirely when one of my ex-coworkers introduced me to a single friend.  She seemed super into me at first, and I even had a second date (achievement unlocked!) at her place before she blindsided me with the \"let's be friends\" spiel.  At this point, there was no more gas left in the tank and I haven't tried since.", "subreddit": "ForeverAlone"}

{"post_id": "bgj6ot", "created_utc": 1556040673, "title": "I felt like it was a good choice to tell you guys my story of me getting into a relationship (which ended badly due to me reasons why I\u2019m here)", "author": "Juche16789", "self_text": "So.... yeah. Hi! So lets just start with some important fact about me I guess? I recently moved to a new school since I got kicked out due to having low grades. It wasn\u2019t the first time I got kicked out. It was my second. The first one was in a prestigious school in the Philippines, Ateneo. I left grade 8. I had my grade 9 in another prestigious school,La Salle, which put me into prohibition which only allowed me to fail one. I failed one subject so I moved into a smaller school. Usually I hated socialising cause from past experiences people will just call me dumb, stupid, \u201cbobo\u201d, \u201ctanga\u201d or they would have high expectations of me and then that I\u2019m smart cause I was from Ateneo but in the end I just end up crushing that expectation and end up making them believe I\u2019m stupid. But, this new small school I\u2019m in, which is called NorthField by the way, is way better then I expected. When I moved to a new school the teachers would always say \u201cah the students here are nice\u201d but they just end up being false statements. But in this new school the teachers were actually being honest. My new classmates were treating me nice and always were trying to hard to make me join their conversations and always wanted me to be part of the fun even when I try to distance myself out of fear of making them hate me and crushing their expectations of what kind of person I am. A good example was that we had a soiree which everyone went to except me. Everyone tried to convince me to go but not forcefully. They were saying \u201chey (my name), just tell us if you change your mind ok? I promise it will be fun and I want you to be part of that fun!\u201d. I still didn\u2019t go cause of insecurities. So yeah. After the soiree i was getting bullied by this dude who happened to be my old bully in Ateneo. He made several fake accounts and threatened to rape me but I didn\u2019t mind them. I reported him when he made a fake account with my name and sent this girl a dic pic. My friend texted me asking if I was sending dic pics and I told him it was the bully. Next thing you know, I texted the girl saying sorry I got her into this mess and we started to talk everyday. It felt so satisfying cause someone is talking to me and enjoys it rather then me watching youtube videos and talking to noone and being alone.  I always thought I wouldn\u2019t have a chance in love life and I would just end up dying alone. Then she came into my life and all of that thought went away. She later then met my classmate who eventually became my best friend and third wheel in my relationship with her. She would always ask him to send pictures of me and stuff like that. I didn\u2019t mind cause she told me she loved me and all that cheesy shit. So it went like this for 2 months and she got mad I didn\u2019t talk to her in a event so she went on a date with my best friend and they ended up together. Before they got together she told me she wanted to breakup. I accepted it. After the break up I learned about how much they have lied to me. The two people I trusted in life. I thought they were people i could trust but they just kept lying to me. She lied that she didn\u2019t find me weird. She lied to me that she didn\u2019t like him. He lied to me that he didn\u2019t like her. He lied to me that even if i broke up with her, he wouldn\u2019t end up with her. He lied to me that he actually wanted to be friends with me. They lied to me that i was special to them. I already told them how much i trusted them and how they were only the few friends or special ones i cared about then they just left me.

I have friends that live with their parents and completely don\u2019t understand what I have to deal with; subletting or living in a place that\u2019s not safe or can be called home. \nAll I do is try to make things work and I get slapped in the face again. \nHad a friend she stopped talking to me after everything we\u2019ve been through together for years I watched her whilst her sister was dying in hospital. I got her out of that hole... she just left me out of her life because I wanted to study in a different city. My other friends have done similar things when I was younger and I didn\u2019t have many. All my life being laughed at because I\u2019m too quiet yet I\u2019m a very feeling and caring person. Chose to live with people here turns out they are absolutely horrible. For next year one of my good friends is suddenly backing out and I could have nowhere to live. All in the last minute. \n\nThe ironic thing is I give my help my time to this absolute fu**er that\u2019s made hell out of this flat. And he still had the courage to lie in front of all of us when there was an inspection. \n\nMost people have shown me they don\u2019t care. I don\u2019t know what to think I don\u2019t really have hope. I don\u2019t know how people like that can live with themselves. Nothing is shining the light. I\u2019m better off on my own to avoid stress. Why can\u2019t we all be honest and make good in this world? Great start into adult life", "subreddit": "ForeverAlone"}

This causes me to feel significantly isolated and often wondering if I am the only person alive that has these thoughts.\n\n(In context, I do have friends and family and on the surface I am relatively outgoing but I struggle significantly with social anxiety and don\u2019t open up fully to anyone in my world because I haven\u2019t yet met anyone who I have similar interests to or feel would understand and connect with my emotions).\n\nThe way I make it from day-to-day is by trying to consolidate my thoughts and feel happy in the fact that I am being true to myself, as I am the only person who truly knows me and I find solace in that.\n\nA cathartic feeling for me is by realising that every single minuscule moment, every action, every random event, every fucked up feeling and emotion, is a complete fucking miracle, happening purely by chance, and will never happen again in the same context in the history of the earth. Every moment is an individual moment to you. Own it and make it your story, because even if it makes you feel fucking terrible, it\u2019s a moment you\u2019ll never get back and that feeling is life itself.\n\nEven though sometimes i feel so isolated that it causes me to hit such an emotional low - this is what makes me, me (clich\u00e9 I know), and that low makes me feel more part of this earth than any basic, mundane happiness that every other \u2018normal\u2019 person is experiencing.\n\nIt\u2019s fair to say I have embraced my depression and am making attempts to nurture it to grow and better myself and the people around me - because although we are all selfish beings at the centre of our own world, just because you feel at an all time low doesn\u2019t mean others don\u2019t have a right to be happy.\n\n(I\u2019d be interested to hear other people\u2019s views on coping with feeling isolated and also whether my writing just comes across as a pretentious way of hearing my own voice).", "subreddit": "lonely"}

The only thing that gets better is that you no longer have to sit in it every day. But nothing changes. \n\nThe only difference in how others treat you is that outside of high school people need to put on polite airs as per professional and/or societal expectations. People don't suddenly see you any different than they did, nor does the time after graduation magically mold everyone into more mature and open individuals like they'd have you believe.\n\nThe cliques are still there. Except instead of outwardly pushing you out, the walls are invisible now. So now it looks like people are open to making a connection with you, yet they never give you any effort or initiative; you send all the texts and invites and they politely respond/decline until you get the hint. It's lot as cutthroat but no less exclusive.\n\nNobody's social life does a 180 after high school. These stories of loner Redditors breaking out of their shell are mostly just people retroactively exaggerating their loner-ness to make their story more inspiring to get top comment. They had plenty of friends and/or relationships no doubt. The ugly duckling stories? They had mild acne or braces, not permanently ugly traits. These people don't and will never know what it's like to be truly at the bottom of the ladder.\n\nIn general, don't listen to Redditors looking back at their high school lives. Normies love the \"high school sucks\" train even though most of them likely had decent runs. It's 'cool' for your backstory to have been a past loner who broke out and grew. Not so much to actually be a loner.", "subreddit": "ForeverAlone"}

Sorry for the long post I wanted to be as detailed as I could.", "author": "altaccount8752", "self_text": "Iv posted here a few times but never really gave a compete backstory for my life. I don\u2019t have anyone else to talk to or ask about this so I was hoping this sub could give me some advice or input. Anything is welcome\n\nSo right now I\u2019m 21yo Guy but my birthday is in late June. Like I said I don\u2019t have anyone to talk to about being alone or to ask about my situation. \n\n  When I was younger 15-16 I was in school and had friends a social life and admittedly a girl who was actually into me (though I never perused I was scared). Then I was kicked out of the school I went to because I lived outside of the district. The only alternative school was to far out of the way for me to attend, and it had a really bad reputation for violence even a shooting happened there. So going there wasn\u2019t really an option. So it was decided that I was to be homeschooled which backfired tremendously. It turned out to be uncredited and a waste of time and money. I had to get a ged and I was told that geds are practically worthless compared to hs diplomas.\n\n  After I started homeschooling my social life dwindled to about three guy friends and no girls. I didn\u2019t really think much of it because I had basically all the free time I wanted to play video games and relax. I had no idea that I was wasting time and opportunities to have a social life and find a relationship. \n\n  Then when I turned 18 my family decided to move out of my hometown 4 states away. I didn\u2019t really think much of it because I was still stuck in neutral, just waking up playing video games and going to sleep. But when we moved it was in the middle of nowhere. I\u2019m talking all the land that was around my house for miles was farm land owned by one guy.\n  \n  Once we were finally moved everything changed. I didn\u2019t have anyone to talk to, and living in the middle of nowhere I didn\u2019t have the kind of connection with people I had before. On top of that I didn\u2019t have the kind of internet to support video games, so that\u2019s when I started being really lone for the first time.\n\n  We lived there for a little over 1.5 years and I know I put myself into this position by not really doing anything. All I really did was help out around the house and watch tv. But I never got a job or even tried to make friends and I blamed it on my location. But it was really my inability to put myself out there. Especially after being by myself for that long. I basically forgot how it was like even having friends or interacting with people. I think I left the house maybe 4 times in the entire time I lived there.\n\n  Then I was told the we were going to move again close to my brothers who are quite a bit older than me. I was exited and nervous at the same time. But after we moved where I live now, it\u2019s exactly like it was at the old place and man it\u2019s depressing. I still live in the middle of nowhere it might actually be be even further in the sticks than before.\n\n  It\u2019s been 2 years here now and I basically have lost all hope. I haven\u2019t had a single friend in 4 years. I haven\u2019t talked to a girl with intent to ask out in 5 or 6 years. I gained quite a bit of weight and have become insanely depressed. The things that I used to keep me occupied now just make it worse. My brother came over and told me to start living my life but I don\u2019t know how. I don\u2019t know how to make friends anymore, or even how to enjoy myself. I feel like life is passing me by even as I write this way to long post. I can\u2019t help but feel like sleeping forever.\n\n  So after so long and no end in sight I don\u2019t know what to do anymore. Before I found this sub I thought that it got better for just about everyone but now after seeing how many people around my age or older in the same spot but actually trying and not finding success I just feel like there\u2019s no hope. \n\n\n   Any advice or help would be amazing.", "subreddit": "ForeverAlone"}

We have what is called a mandatory government service in my country (for doctors working in government hospitals), where we have to work in a remote town for a set time before getting our diplomas (shitty I know). So a year ago I got sent to this small town by the sea. I felt like my life as I know it was over and felt dead inside for a long time. I had no friends nowhere to go besides work. The only thing I could do was work work work and than go the gym and work out some more. I had no joy in life, I still don\u2019t but that\u2019s beside the point. Anyway I was lonely as fuck, alienated and just miserable.\n\nIn this year period I have travelled around 20 times to my hometown for various reasons. Most of them being therapy courses/supervisions regarding my job or long holidays.\n\nMy parents are separated and I haven\u2019t spoken to my excuse of a dad in 5 years. The only family I got left is my mum, I guess seeing me makes her happy so there\u2019s that. But other than that I feel like shit every time I come here. At first it feels fine, I enjoy my mums cooking, we converse for a bit but then it hits me. The crushing loneliness I mean. Sometimes I see a friend or two which I think they only agree to see me out of pity, sometimes I sleep with people thinking company would help me but in the end I always end up alone and more depressed than ever. This is really pathetic and let me tell you why. I get sad when I\u2019m away because I feel like I don\u2019t belong in that town but when I come to my hometown where my community supposed to be I feel lonelier than ever. So now I have no place where I can be happy and I am literally in this endless purgatory. I have no roots, nowhere I can call \u2018home\u2019.\n\nAfter all this I decided to minimise my visits here because at least when I\u2019m working I tend not to think about how lonely I am and life goes by isolated or not..\n\nThank you r/lonely for listening and being there for me.", "subreddit": "lonely"}

Karma doesn't exist.", "author": "wasting_my_youth", "self_text": "I was bullied a lot throughout primary school and then high school. I remember complaining to my dad about how I was bullied and how I had no friends and he just told me that it's fine because I'll end up using my academics to have an amazing career while those bullies will end up with worse careers and no family in the future. I was also told similar things by online friends I've had in the past. I read books, watched movies and consumed media portraying this same idea that bullies will always \"get what's coming to them!! StAy sTrOnG! !!!!\" \n\nIn reality, this just isn't true. I'm 18 now and I've seen what has happened to those bullies. They're now either studying top tier degrees in university like medicine, law, architecture, STEM subjects or they're already training to become engineers or business people because their parents already work in that field. These same bullies also have multiple friends who they hang out with every week. If their parents somehow disowned them, these bullies would have their close friends to turn to who they could live with. These same bullies are still well liked by most people they come into contact with, they're easily able to date people, they're physically fit, they have a variety of hobbies, they're just all around happier than the people who they spent their school days tormenting. They're doing good. No karma has hit them and it probably never will. In 20 years time, they'll have a loving family and they'll be earning \u00a3100K per year. These people will never, ever experience karma. They'll never know what it's like to be bullied, to be the social outcast, to be at the very bottom of society. \n\nI still think it's important for us ugly, awkward, social outcasts to find interests and hobbies and build on our academics to have a well respected future career because that makes up for our social isolation and that will get us at least a tiny bit of respect from society. The  point I'm making is that we shouldn't be told that our bullies will get what is coming for them because that's just not true. If someone is highly intelligent, an over achiever, athletic, attractive, popular during their school days then it's highly likely they'll stay that way for the rest of their lives. They'll never have any remorse for the way they bullied people either. \n\nTL;DR:   The popular, smart kids who bullied you in high school will be well liked, well adjusted adults who will have respected jobs and loving families. They'll never feel sorry for the way they treated you and they'll never get any sort of justice.", "subreddit": "ForeverAlone"}

My whole life, my mom did whatever possible to avoid that I\u2019d make the same mistakes as her; not finishing school, living an unhappy marriage, having a job she didn\u2019t really enjoy. \nI think she did pretty well. I\u2019m working towards my dreamjob. I stand my own ground. \n\nBut when I lost her, I lost everything else with her. Her death made me realize a lot of things, and showed the true face of a lot of people around me.\n\nI have my father and brother left, but they genuinely don\u2019t care about me. They never ask how I do or aren\u2019t interested in what I\u2019m doing. My father just gives me money for school, but, in the brief moments of contact we have, he makes sure to repeat as much as possible that I am a financial burden to him. \n\nI\u2019ve tried maintaining contact but it\u2019s always me, except when they need me for some problem solving. I stopped caring. So there I lost my father and brother, too.\n\nThe rest of the family, well, some acted very bad on my mom\u2019s funeral. I stopped talking to some of them. Others are busy woth life. I don\u2019t think they forgot about me, but just have so much stuff to do. I too, have a lot of stuff going on. Sometimes I wish they would reach out because I don\u2019t have the strength to do it anymore. \n\nAnd up to two weeks ago I had a boyfriend and my wonderful cats. \nI realized after my mom\u2019s death that I wasn\u2019t happy with the relationship anymore. We tried and I broke it off because it wasn\u2019t going anywhere. I know it\u2019s my fault. I know I made myself all alone. He will take the cats because I can\u2019t pay for them right now. \n\nThere is a very small crush I have on somebody, but the person rejects me without even knowing.\n\nI\u2019m glad I have friends, even very good ones. The bests I could actually find I guess. But they have their lives. Their families, their friends, their partners.\n\nWhat I meant at the very beginning is that I don\u2019t feel lonely somehow, thanks to my good friends. But I\u2019m alone because nobody waits for me and nobody awaits me. Nobody loves or cares for me. I could have an accident, they woulnd\u2019t notice, at least not directly. \n\nI feel abandoned in some way. There are so many people out there, yet I feel all alone. I also feel stupid, because it somehow feels like I\u2019ve let them all go and that it is my fault. \n\nI don\u2019t love myself and I know I should. Maybe life would be easier. Maybe I have to learn to be content with just myself, learn not to be scared of being alone.

{"post_id": "bh50cg", "created_utc": 1556170647, "title": "Do things ever really change?", "author": "pterodamian", "self_text": "I guess in the name of context, I should mention that my early childhood was less than optimal. I'm currently on my fourth father figure in life at 21 years old; bio dad was gone pretty quick, ages 6-9 were terrorized by an alcoholic meth head who abused me and my mother, the next husband kinda went psycho and things got bad again, but we pushed through and found the current one, who at least isn't a bad person. I've accepted all of that, it doesn't really bother me, but it's a necessary part of my story.\n\nWhen my mom started to get serious with her current husband, we moved into a new house with him and his daughters near the coast. I was in 8th grade, and ecstatic at the idea that I might get to spend all of my high school years in one place. Because of all the turmoil with my mom's significant others, I'd moved to a new school every single grade from 1st to 8th (9th if you count the transition to high school. I do.) It was a totally new experience for me, the idea of living a normal social life.\n\nTo sum up four years as quickly as possible, I learned how socially inept I was. Sophomore year I absolutely fell for a girl, the only time I'd ever known the feelings of love, lust, and desire for another person. The only problem was, she didn't feel the same way, and I didn't know how to handle rejection. It took over a year to recover from my deep obsession with her, but then my instability and ham-fisted attempts at finding someone else meant I lost good friends and alienated pretty much anyone I tried to get close to. In my senior year, I'd finally found a decent group of people who accepted me and my oddness, and seemed to be on a track towards learning how to really interact with people. It was wonderful...\n\n...until I got mono right after winter break and missed several months of school. The last time I saw most of those people was in a haze as my parents helped me off the field at graduation because I'd fallen asleep.\n\nBut college will be great, right?\n\nAfter a lackluster summer that involved living in a travel trailer with the rest of my family (it's hell), I moved 900 miles across two states to go to college somewhere new. I thought it would be a great new start.\n\nThat was almost three years ago now. And while college certainly hasn't been bad, it wasn't what I hoped. My first year, I really tried to put myself out there. I let myself have crushes, but I never got up the nerve to approach anyone. I made enough friends that I wasn't totally alone, but by the end of my second year, I'd pretty much accepted my fate. This past year has been even worse, I've essentially given up on meeting anyone and suppressed feelings when I've had them. When I think about just the concept of it, I don't feel too bad, though. It's just how I am.\n\nBut then I open my eyes to the world around me, with its pop culture and social media pounding into my head, and I realize I'm a hopeless 21 year old virgin who has somehow made it through all of high school and college without going on a single date. What a fucking loser. \n\nIn high school, I hated myself. I'm honestly surprised I didn't kill myself at some point during that shit show, but I kinda have a history of surviving all kinds of shit at this point. I came to college, and really wanted to accept who I am. And I did. \n\nI'm fucking awesome. I'm smarter than pretty much everyone I've known, my school grades don't show it, but my endless hobbies and interests do. I got my pilot's license at 17, and am damn good at it for my age. I play tuba, trombone, euphonium, flute, guitar, and bass to varying levels; I live and breathe music in everything else I do. I'm pretty solid at computers, making stuff in several different mediums, and even dabble in art and graphic design if I have a good idea in my head. Beyond planes, I know more about cars and motorcycles than anyone my age should, and am good at driving both. Shooting is a hobby of mine (even though it's kinda persecuted today, but that's another discussion), and I plan to compete more once I'm done with school. By this August, I'll be working a job that'll take me all around the world working on drones, and I'll be paid nearly six figures to do it. My life is set, and I couldn't ask for much more...\n\n...except, maybe for that date?\n\nI have so much going on, so much passion for everything I do, that I want nothing more than to share it. There has to be someone out there who sees that, right? Someone who shares even one or two of those interests and can relate to me? I look at that list, and wonder how no one seems to care about someone who has the gifts I do. I might sound like a wealthy, entitled piece of shit right now, but I'm really pretty friendly in person. Extremely quiet, shy, and awkward but warm-hearted and caring of others. Not that anyone notices, no one ever talks to me.\n\nThe title of this: \"Do things ever really change?\" Will I ever be able to come out of my shell and really be a functioning member of society? Will society stop being one collective asshole that shits on anyone who doesn't play by its shallow, conformity-based rules? Is this blessed life of talent and energy going to finally shed the dark cloud of loneliness and rejection that's been there as long as I can remember?\n\nI'm starting to believe that the answer is a hard \"no.\"", "subreddit": "lonely"}

When venting sometimes we say stuff that even we know isn't true. Our being depressed about being FA gets us to say things about ourselves that outsiders consider too negative. Some of them take our venting and use it against us in an attempt to help us. They think we are inferior to them. I'm not saying all outsiders do this or even most do this. This isn't against anyone in particular. I'm just sick and tired of it. \n\nWe have a large percentage of teenage posters. Some of them vent and say how ugly they are and how they will always be FA. I will tell them every time to not give up because once you get past a certain age it becomes much harder than it already is to escape FA but I'm also not going to talk down to them. Who the F am I to tell these people it's unhealthy to say those things about yourself from I'm ugly to I will always be FA? Who the F am I to also tell them to give up it's over? Obviously telling a 19 year old kid that it's over for him isn't the best thing to say. While I agree that 19 year old shouldn't give up, I'm not their therapist. I'm not going to pretend to be intellectually superior and that they should avoid saying those horrid things about themselves. Imagine the ego you must have to have to go around thinking you know what's best for a stranger on the internet? \n\nI will always protect FA'ers. This is a place for some FA'ers to get advice on how to escape FA. It's also a place where some FA'ers can vent like I do. Why go to the one place where we can vent without being judged for it, and judging them in a passive way? It's because you think you are helping them. Those FA'ers say things that obviously aren't true. Obviously they need the guidance of some outsider who is playing internet therapist. Maybe they are a therapist. It doesn't matter. My last therapist was a therapist and was extremely unprofessional. \n\nIf you want to judge me, go ahead. I deserve it. Tell me how toxic my views are. Tell me I hate women. Tell me how I should never give up even after hundreds of rejections. Tell me they weren't even rejections because obviously you were there. Tell me I never actually tried to date. When you do this, I find it humorous because the only one who tried for all those years is me. The same goes for other FA'ers. Who are you to judge us? But you just want to help.

The bus was going the other direction, so I was expecting the bus stop to be on the other side.

He says \"eleven fourteen\". I respond with but that's only two numbers, I need 4... He laughs, and says \"Bro, eleven fourteen is 4 digits...\". Felt like a moron, everyone else in the room also laughed.\n\n\n\n- I'm playing cards with some people and we're missing a few cards from the deck. So I instead find the needed cards from another deck and hand it to them. They're like \"Ah thanks, but the back of these cards look different\". And I was confused - \"Why does that matter?\". They gave me a wtf look and then \"Because then everyone knows what your cards are?\". Such an obvious thing...\n\n\n\n- I get soaked in the rain because for some reason I think my new rain jacket doesn't have a hoodie. After complaining to a few people, one of them takes my jacket and opens the hoodie at the back, which is folded inwards so I missed it...

I thought to myself \"who knows, maybe eventually I'm getting used to it?\" But no. Just no. A sudden, sharp pain surge attacked me during yesterday's evening. Like a stray bullet hitting you out of nowhere. It hurt. My sould was bleeding out. I went to bed truly depressed.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nToday I woke up. The pain manifested itself almost immediately. But I had to attend classes, so I got up and marched forward. First classes, okay it hurts, but it's manageable, I can focus. Then the 2 hours of break. It felt terrible. I sat in front of my computer trying to do something productive, but my body decided against it. I started shaking and shivering. I felt a bit of coldness, but mostly it was actually an uncomfortable, painful, pulsing warmth. It strarted from my chest, then it spread towards my stomach, limbs and head. Within the 30 minutes my whole body was \"infected\". I felt an agonizning pain and couldn't focus on anything. It was getting worse and worse. The thoughts of being alone and having no one to hold me were consuming me like a flame, like a poison. Eventually those 2 hours had passed. I got up to go to my next classes. A sudden shar pain made it difficult for me to walk. It felt as if my legs became made if concrete. My arms also, which made een my laptop feel absurdly heavy. I could feel the weakness all over my body.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAlso I was on combat mode. For no reason. I was scared of someone or something to jump at me and try to stab me, shoot me or whatever. For no reason. People I saw were friendly, no one was hostile, no couples on sight, just a peaceful day. No dangers detected. But I just couldn't relax and deactivate the combat mode of my brain. During the classes I was shaking so much that I had problems typing in my keyboard. I've clenched my teeth and barely managed to survive by focusing on stuff that I had to do.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThen I came back home. I put down my laptop and just laid on the bed. Suddenly a weird surge of coldness appeared. I was lying there trying to get some sleep and also drunk a bit of water (over 20 degrees and I haven't even had a drink the whole day, how clever of me, but well...). Then I fell asleep. But it was a rough sleep. I didn't rest well, I was shaking and felt warmth as if I had a fever. As I was lying, my brain eventually had decided to turn off the combat mode and the mental pain of being lonely simply left. I was relaxed on the mental plane, but as for my body and physiology, the sickness was still there.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnd so here I am, thirsty, deprived from sleep, tired, with pain all over my body and possibly a fever. I try to drink, but even that makes me wanna puke (obviously haven't even touched food today). I will try to sleep throught the night, but easier said than done. I don't know why I feel like this. Maybe it was just a  coincidence? I've catched a cold, and it mainfested itself during the time in which I felt so alone and that's it? Or am I truly, literally, physically sick and in pain simply from loneliness and had I had a gf, I would be healthy?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\"Just put yourself out there and be confident.\" Yeah, I'm definitely going to do that with my whole body being sick.", "subreddit": "ForeverAlone"}

It starts with this introduction:\n\n&gt;It seems contradictory, but life has never been as crowded and yet, as lonely, as it is right now. In fact, medical experts are calling loneliness the medical epidemic of our time. And you might be surprised who suffers.\n\nThe psychologist they briefly talk to says that a smoker who quits reduces his likelihood of early death the same amount as does a lonely person who resolves his loneliness by joining a social group.\n\nOk, sounds like a problem. But here are the \"lonely\" people the reporter interviews to illustrate this point:\n\n* [William Shatner](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Shatner), who sometimes feels lonely when staying in hotels while on the road doing speaking engagements. He suggests that other people suffering from this should \"do something for somebody else\".\n* a beautiful mother with a small baby. She never thought she could be afflicted by this, but after giving birth, she sometimes feels lonely despite her many friends, and her family who lives just around the corner. To resolve this, she joined a group of local mothers.\n* a Japanese man whose wife died of cancer and who is estranged from his daughter. He regularly pays 2 professional \"friends\" to pretend to be his wife and daughter. The \"friends\" say they have many other clients like this.\n* a woman who lives with her husband and kids on a farm in rural Australia. She acts as the chair of the town's promotion group (some sort of social club). When she got cancer, the whole town rallied around her.\n\nLooks like they batted about .250.

This is the only life I have and I\u2019m stuck with this. \u00a0This is a part of my identity I\u2019m stuck with! I get depressed every time I thoroughly think about how I\u2019m stuck like this. I always want to cry. I can\u2019t feel cool no matter what I become because of this piece of me. There are so many disadvantages that come with being short, ugly and brown, I couldn\u2019t list them all. To sum all of those things up, more people want less to do with you than they would an average looking or attractive person and see you as beneath those other people. Anything that involves being face to face with another person affects ugly people. \u201cBe confident\u201d doesn't mean a thing to me. It's an imaginary idea. I have too many problems and insecurities and circumstances that make my life miserable. I don\u2019t like being associated with this ugly. I don\u2019t like being reminded by myself that I look this way. It\u2019s like going outside with your shirt inside out... but with a shirt you can fix it, but being ugly is something that is forever. The only way I can go outside is by forgetting that I\u2019m ugly somehow or by forcing myself by adopting a nihilistic mindset before leaving the house. I\u2019m tired of being beneath others and not good enough. And I can\u2019t do anything about this pain. On top of enduring this pain, I have to suppress it so that I don\u2019t hurt myself or become a danger to society. Being ugly isn\u2019t just something that holds you back. It\u2019s something that eats away at you. I can\u2019t do a thing about it. There are times when I don\u2019t even want to go outside because of the way I look. It\u2019s painful. Sometimes, I have to remind myself that I have to live my life and can\u2019t let being ugly take over. There\u2019s no solution to this. I just have to deal with it and the sadness that comes with it. Many people don\u2019t have to deal with this at all, so they don\u2019t have the solution for it or need a solution. No matter how much I explain how this feels, no one who isn\u2019t like me will ever understand what it\u2019s like. I\u2019m tired of my therapists sugar coating things for example telling me I\u2019m not ugly. They only say that because there\u2019s nothing else they can do or say to people when they\u2019re ugly. And I envy the attractive population so much for it. Wanting to experience what it would be like to be with an attractive person and feeling love leads to viewing of pornography and the viewing of pornography leads to more envy and frustration (on top of all of the other bad things about pornography which is another problem I\u2019m dealing with - health problems). Being reminded of my looks by seeing myself, by seeing someone with better looks or with generally normal or good looks and by seeing people who are intimate irates me so much the same way the other things I'll say do. I wish I could take out all the feelings of anger and envy and inferiority on something. Before, I even wanted to take those feelings out on others but I suppressed those feelings by remembering that doing something unfairly doesn't solve the unfairness I've been dealt.\n\nEdit: Thanks for the comments everyone. To be fair, I don't even know why I share how I feel considering there's no solution to my problem. It's like banging on a door of a jail cell you're locked in. Nothing will change, but there's just a urge to do something.", "subreddit": "ForeverAlone"}

Somehow the child has not learned to get his self-rights  respected; he has not obtained requisite appreciation from the adults  around him for his discrete social self. He has nothing to give to  society, because he has nothing to put forth.... If you lack pride you  have no claim to social honor. There must be actors in our play if we  are to feel its meaning, and not simply a stage propped with non  entities. This type of person is often one who has never learned the  simple basis for the possession of real power to enhance the lives of  others, by forcefully bluffing the social ceremonial. If he failed to  get self-esteem within his family he carries this same failure out into  society. From the outset of his social life outside the family he does  not have the talents necessary to give meaning to the cultural game, to  inflate and sustain others by providing conviction and forceful cues for  them. Being a poor player at the start he never can feel comfortable  with a skill he doesnt have. Every social encounter becomes a painful  stimulus to an acute self-consciousness. And so the individual may  withdraw into himself more and more, since he gets no satisfactory image  of himself in society. When he does step out into society he will do so  on its terms and never on his own, he always fears to claim his just  share of the social mana which everyone is generating. And this is the  one claim we want to see- we want others to claim a share so that we can  feel there is something worth claiming.\n\nErnest Becker", "subreddit": "ForeverAlone"}

I often have trouble sleeping and wake up numerous times during the night. \n\nI grab my phone and scroll through all the texts. TL;DR version is she's at an afterparty (this is at 1AM) and one of the other friends is hunting for a guy. Emily said she's just feeling lonely and horrible because drunk and horny guys are perving over her even though she's engaged and keeps telling them. \n\nI reply at 2AM right after waking up saying sorry about her situation and laughing with her at the hipocracy of it all. However she sends back a text that really broke my heart. \"I'm really happy I found [future husbands name] because he never makes me feel alone.\"\n\nShe didn't mean anything negative by it of course, I couldn't reply to that. I just asked her to shoot me a text when she's safe at home and sat down for a few minutes in the dark. That slow wave of loneliness building up that I might never find my future husband, she spent the night out on the town and I spent the night watching old movies and drinking coco alone in my room. \n\nPerhaps its silly, but it really got to me for the first time in a long time and I felt I had to just share with someone... even a faceless stranger on the internet.

It's as if I've been trapped in a coma during those periods of depression and isolation only to be awakened at that fact that I've long been left behind. Checking on facebook was a bad idea. To see my high school friends getting married, making new friends and generally having a good ass time while I'm wallowing in self-hatred only amplifies how much I've failed as a human being. The sad thing is that I didn't even realize how much time I've wasted until I turned 30. It's mind-boggling how fast time has entirely slipped through my head without ever realizing it. All those years wasted, spending days and nights alone in the room, just eating, shitting, watching anime and masturbating like I had all time in the world. Enjoying the NEET life right?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow I'm old. My intelligence is still that of a child. I could start trying again but I will never ever be able to catch-up to the golden time in my 20s. My depression still ever lingers and meeting people will just make them wonder what the hell is wrong with me. To make things worse, physically I still look like a fucking teenager albeit with old sagging pored skins. Typical /r/13or30 material. I'm just repugnant. Even people at my age group would not take me serious because I'm simply not relatable at all.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow, I want to change and truly do. Social anxiety is the first thing I've never addressed. This has always been an issue even as a child but I believe this stems from something else. Perhaps its the fact that every time I open my mouth I can say the most inane shit no one thought to be possible without thinking. The things I've said are probably stupid enough people will make reddit posts about. To make matter worse, I'm a slow learner, always been, I suspect my IQ is probably somewhere around 60-70. So how does one raise their IQ when it's genetically embedded in my DNA? No one wants to be friends with a retard like me. There are times that people would ask me simple questions and I would just completely blank out like I never \"get it\". Staying mute was the way to go.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBack to the physical part, I'm short and look fucking strange. My bone structures never grew as they should, leading to a somewhat stunted development. To put this into perspective, if you put a tape measure around my wrists they're at about 5 inches long. My face and head are also extremely small, the width is about 5 inches wide. A samsung phone could pretty much covers 70% of my face LOL. Seeing me in public is like seeing a freak out of a circus wagon. To give you a picture, see Gary Coleman. Am I supposed to do plastic surgery now?

I'm from the UK, where sports like football (you call it soccer) rugby and cricket are extremely popular, and it seems like while growing up most boys will choose one of these to be their main sport that they play obsessively. I think these sorts of sports actually have a pretty big impact on boys development, especially when it comes to developing masculine traits. They help you to grow confidence (assuming you're good at the sport), they encourage you to be assertive and argue your point if you think you've been penalised unfairly, they encourage you to be competitive and aggressive without being violent, they improve your physical fitness so you also look more masculine, and they provide an important means of bonding with other men.\n\nBecause I never took part in any of those sports, I missed out on this development and that might be part of the reason that I grew up to be a very meek and subservient person who is afraid of any kind of confrontation, the complete contradiction to those masculine traits that women find attractive. Also having no interest of knowledge of those sports makes it a lot more difficult for me to relate to other men, for whom these are often a major topic of conversation. I'm not saying that not being involved in team sports is a main reason I'm FA and of course you can grow up to be a completely normal and well adjusted man without ever taking part in them.

Even with my anxieties, I think I managed to be much more outgoing and fun than my usual quiet and boring self, so not everything yesterday was so negative. After it was done and on the bus ride back, I fell asleep on her shoulder, and I think it was this little thing that finally brought back my loneliness. I\u2019ve never had a girlfriend and I hardly have any friends who are girls, so this was kinda a big deal for me.

It was just so nice to just have someone there, and it was nice to share some physical contact with her, even if it was minuscule.

At 30 I have found it\u2019s hard to make friends and find outlets in life. We allow so many things to become a reason not to or a reason why not.  As I\u2019m trying to revamp some things in my own life and get on a more positive page I am trying to make more friends.   -About Me- \t\u00d8 I\u2019m a fan of life long learning. I have always been an avid reader and I love to have conversations with people about things they are passionate about.   \t\u00d8 I love to run, hike, rock climb and lift weights. Staying active is a way for me to clear my mind and relax. Recovering from a major knee surgery so I\u2019ve been laid up most of the last 8 months but starting to get the wheels rolling again.   \t\u00d8 Music is a huge part of my life, I play guitar and almost always have something playing. I enjoy a lot of variety and love to find new artist, songs, styles to try out. Make suggestions!!  \t\u00d8 A creative outlet is important for my sanity. I enjoy writing &amp; sketching. It\u2019s refreshing and expressive for me to get it out on paper and see that physical translation of thoughts to creation.   \t\u00d8 As far as looks I\u2019m tall and large at 6\u20192\u201d, 240 lbs. Not the best shape of my life at the moment because of the knee surgery but the road to recovery is started and I\u2019m setting some goals for the summer!

{"post_id": "bi3jnm", "created_utc": 1556398786, "title": "University clubs and \"support groups\" are a cruel farce (maybe my depression has made me cynical)", "author": "yurmumgay1998", "self_text": "So I am a 20 year old male college student at UT Austin just about to complete his sophomore year at college. To be clear, I enjoy the majors I am in and find the topic material that I study interesting and useful. However, one thing I have struggled to do ever since the first day of freshman year was to find a my niche in the university's web of organizations. I am involved in some organizations that I enjoy but when I try to network and branch out (or when clubs try to advertise themselves publicly \\[especially those that are oriented for the lost and wandering\\]) I get absolutely livid at how out of touch these representational cliques are with facts about the people they are supposedly trying to recruit or assist. There is a local chapter of NAMI here on campus that organizes \"fun activities\" and demonstrations for awareness on all sorts of mental illnesses. This is supposed to \"remove the stigma\" supposedly on these conditions. Browsing the university page for this group makes me sick. To see so many chipper, naive young faces beam their synthetic smiles at the camera for promotional shots; to see all the hard work they put into glittering their neon colored posters; to see them coddling cute bunnies and puppies without a care in the world; turns my stomach inside out. It seems to me so utterly oblivious and cruel that an organization with the mission of bringing attention to the existence of mental illness the sheer gravity of the epidemic could promote themselves so shamelessly. I wonder how they can believe that their parading about town as they do with wide grins and pithy slogans on cardboard is helping ANYONE who feels depressed, alone, suicidal, anxious find the help and understanding they need. This rant isn't so much levied at NAMI exclusively as it is toward most University endorsed support groups and initiatives whose corporate structure of leadership is saturated with people of the total and complete opposite end of the spectrum as their sought after constituencies, whose efforts are no more than moral posturing and back-patting, and altogether nothing more than a superficial effort to present the semblance of concern. If I be wrong, then at the very least what is clear is that if there is any genuine concern, the efforts are seriously misguided and offensive to those who feel truly and utterly abandoned and imprisoned in their own despair. A few weeks ago my Resident Assistant conducted peer interviews to see how we were all coming along over the course of the semester. I ventilated to him perhaps a little to vehemently. He asked if there was anything more I wanted to report about how I was feeling if I was certain that I was ok. But no amount of verbal coaxing could make me spit out how I was rotting on the inside. All year I had to endure the irritating atmosphere of purely synthetic \"jovial community\" and advertisements for fun events. I had no care for movie watching, karaoke, playing card games, making finger paintings, musical chairs or the like while I felt so hopeless. And I certainly wasn't inclined to attend any of the mockeries of \"self-help therapy\" only to show up and realize that the substantive issues of which most people were feeling anxious or \"depressed\" about were pitiful excuses for feeling so (exams, eating clean, staying within a budget). The fact of the matter is that university initiatives to find and root out depression and hopelessness are either seriously misguided or a cruel joke to begin with.", "subreddit": "ForeverAlone"}

I waited for the next time our teacher put us in groups so I could use that as an opportunity but he never did. One night I ended up finding her on instagram so I followed her. I posted a \u201ctbh\u201d on my instagram (basically a post where people like it and you tell them how feel about them honestly) and hoped she would like it. And she did! So we started talking and I found out she was a transfer student from a theater school. For the first week, we were just texting. No real life conversation. Then SHE finally ask for us to meet after school first the first time. It went pretty well. So for a month after, she would keep asking me to hang out. I would always text her but she loved hanging out with me even more and I was always up for it too!\n\nI was going through our old messages at 3am last night and here they are:\n\n[She was always down to hang out and never took no for an answer!](https://imgur.com/a/v0ypOoO)\n\n[She once told me how much she valued our friendship.](https://imgur.com/a/xTd100d)\n\n[She even made a sexual innuendo ;) a couple times (that went over my head too lol)](https://imgur.com/a/VwbxEdu)\n\nI ended up finding out  (she didn\u2019t know) that she sat with no-one at lunch and went to the library everyday alone. So I decided to invite her to hangout with me outside of school during lunch. She told me she knew I had friends I sat with but I told her she was my friend too. I knew how it felt to be lonely during lunch and i didn\u2019t want her to have to feel the same way I had before. \n\nLong story short, I discovered how dope of a person she was. We would text all the time and talk, we would go out for lunch during school almost everyday, we would hang out after school some days and the weekend. She even came to meet up with me when I was still drunk after a school trip (don\u2019t ask lol) I FINALLY had a close friend! A person that I could text to all day and hang out with whenever. [Something that I had been wishing for a long time](https://np.reddit.com/r/CasualConversation/comments/8e7gut/does_anyone_else_wish_they_had_one_friend_that/)(but I hadn\u2019t realized) I never had that in my three years in high school!\n\nAnyways, June comes along and the school year is starting to end. We had multiple days off and final testing was beginning so we slow down talking and seeing each other a little bit. No issues. Anyways, last day of school comes we talk a little about the testing and whatnot and that was it. July comes and I remember that she was going away to some program at a college in a different state. So I made sure to wish her a safe trip. Anyways, August rolls around and it\u2019s my birthday. I didn\u2019t get any birthday wishes from her. That was weird. Considering how close we were, I expected it. But nothing\u2026. A week later I posted a throwback from my birthday on snapchat. She views it but she doesn\u2019t even hit me up to tell me happy belated or anything. Now September is here and it\u2019s the first two days of school. I didn\u2019t expect her to text much over the summer but I did expect her to when school began. But nothing. I hit her up and I received no response. The following week was her birthday so I wrote her an entire paragraph about how I felt about her being my first closest friend at school. Later that night she replies \u201cThanks.\u201d and that was it.\nOne thing though is that over the summer and first few weeks of September, she stopped viewing my story on snap altogether. But since that late September, she started watching my stories again and hasn\u2019t missed a single one until I nearly freaked out and went crazy in late November and blocked her.\n\nI went from seeing this girl I knew nothing about to getting to know her and being so close and important in my life to being complete strangers. The worst part about being ghosted is not knowing what you\u2019d done wrong or if there\u2019s something wrong with yourself. Was it because I didn\u2019t ask her to hang out over the summer? Was it because I talked about myself too much? I know I have my own issues and mistakes but I try to be one of the realest people anyone could meet - I don\u2019t judge, I\u2019m caring, I\u2019m supportive, I don't have the intent to just have sex with her, I check up on her, I was there for her. She made me feel that at least one person cared about me or was somewhat interested in my life. Before that, I knew people at my school but I really had nobody as close as her. But it\u2019s as if she\u2019d forgotten the way I treated her and things I did for her like hang out with her at lunch when no one else did. She always commented on how I had trust issues but her leaving me after how close we were seriously fed my issues even more. If she could do that then anyone could.\n\nAnd the funny part is that she was telling me about this guy threatening her last year that she hated and I recently found that he commented on her post and she commented back as if they were friends again. And another time she told me about this racist kid that she hated and recently I found her liking his pictures again. But what did I do wrong though??? What could I have done so wrong that you would literally not talk to me again but would talk to the person that was literally threatening you???\n\n\nIf she hit me up to be friends again, I\u2019d probably say no because it\u2019s not fair to me that she did something like that. But in all honestly, I REALLY miss her so much, so bad. It had been getting to my head lately to the point where I had existential thoughts everyday and that no one cares about me in this entire world. Nothing compares to her personality. Now I\u2019ve been stuck with girls that have no clue how to hold conversations, don\u2019t have nearly the same interest in me/personality and literally someone that I thought was cool with that straight up told me that they don\u2019t care about our friendship after we had been talking for nearly every day for 8 months straight. I just feel so goddamn lonely \n\nEvery night I pray to God that a genuine girl with a similar personality will come into my life and stay.\n\nThank you to anyone know read this entire post. You don't understand how I appreciate for at least one person in this world to understand/care &lt;3", "subreddit": "ForeverAlone"}

Its been a rough ride. In some ways it's been great. From a learning/career perspective, I've learned so much and made so many strides. Arguably more than most of my peers. Viewed through the academic achievement lens, its been a success. But I feel like I'm leaving school after 4 years with 0 friends. Now, obviously I have some friends, but no-one I've ever felt close to. I always try and be an outgoing, nice, helpful, funny person, but for some reason I have close to no close friends. I feel like a have a bunch of casual, \"hey, how's it going\" friends, like in passing, but nobody I can ever talk to, share my life with, and hear about theirs. I think what didn't help in college was the fact that I am a pretty strictly straight-edge kind of guy. I don't drink, I don't smoke, I don't like to party, I don't go to clubs (I despise that vibe), and I've stayed far from it. It seems like social groups formed in freshman and sophomore year around parties and then those groups ended up becoming closer friends who do things, but I am never invited to anything. I never have been, and I think about the fact that I wouldn't enjoy them anyway, but it just feels terrible. Social media and instagram stories etc. make things worse. Like I feel actively UN-invited when looking at other people socializing and having fun, and I just don't know what to do. Anyone else feel like this and have any ideas/solutions?

She proceeds to make jokes and twirl her hair. And she started talking about how her night had been boring and shit and asked me how I was doing (keep in mind there was a full line behind me). And the crazy thing was I wasn\u2019t even nervous. I made jokes back and she giggled quite a bit as she was getting my order ready. She was very engaged in the conversation and there was a certain chemistry that was tough to explain. As I\u2019m usually awful socially around girls. \n\nAnyway as I was leaving she gave one last huge smile and a joke and as I was off I looked at her name tag.... and for some stupid fucking reason I decided to look her up on Facebook and sent a friend request.

Dropped a ton of weight, started socializing more, eating healthy, exercising, improving fashion sense, etc. Just generally working on myself. So I meet a girl on a dating app called Hinge, and we match. We talk for a couple weeks over text because we're both busy and also don't want to rush things. We have tons of common interests: video games, game grumps, animals, music, food, and even dungeons and dragons. After 2 weeks we go out to a local Asian restaurant nearby. I'm feeling GOOD. Got a great outfit picked up, feeling trim, all cleaned up, charm turned up to 11. We meet up and she's super cute and nice and fun to talk to. I'm having a great time, feeling really relaxed and talking about stuff I'm genuinely interested in, and she seems to be doing the same. We flirt and exchange stories and jokes and just generally have great conversation. All this to say I thought we had a GREAT first date. Next day I text her and say I had a great time and I hope we can do it again, and later she texts me back saying she had fun too but she just wants to be friends.\n\nQuick aside: in no way am I trying to play the 'friendzoned' card. I'm absolutely fine with having more nerdy gamer friends, especially in my area (Northwest Florida is not exactly a Mecca for geek culture). I was just totally surprised and caught off guard.\n\nAnyway, I was super disappointed because I thought we had great romantic chemistry and I thought we were flirting pretty hard all night. I'm just playing that night over and over in my head and it's driving me crazy. That was easily one of the best dates I've ever been on. I've been working out and dieting for months. I've been spending real time and effort improving my image. I've been taking better care of myself and my surroundings. I was really feeling those results during the date, and now it just feels like absolutely nothing has changed. Like it was all for naught. The conclusion I keep coming to is one of two options:\n\n1. I have no agency in romance. It's a numbers game and I just have to keep hammering away at these miserable dating apps forever with no guarantee of success, and it's more than likely that I never have a date that good again.\n2. I have agency, but not enough to matter. My best just isn't good enough. I lost 70 pounds in 4 months, went from eating McDonald's twice a day to enjoying salad, started lifting 4 times a week, and basically flipped my entire life upside down to improve myself, but all of that wasn't enough. I'm still unattractive and undesirable and no matter what I do or how much I improve, that fact will never change.\n\nEither way, this experience has made me reevaluate basically my entire love life, because if that date didn't qualify as 'sparks flying' then what the hell were my previous girlfriends thinking? Could I have done something differently? Was I just misinterpreting signals? Did she really change her mind about me after 2 hours in my presence? To quote the immortal haddaway: \"What IS love?\".\n\nAgain, I'm NOT trying to play the friend zone card. I'm totally fine being just friends, I'm just really disappointed and shell-shocked because this was not the outcome I was expecting and I just can't stop thinking about it.", "subreddit": "ForeverAlone"}

{"post_id": "bi9eba", "created_utc": 1556442285, "title": "Is it intimacy that I want or just the idea of it?", "author": "reddiforanything", "self_text": "Turning 21 (M) in a couple days. I have a good group of 5 or so friends that I wouldn't trade the world for, yet I feel quite lonely. I'm a virgin, which I don't let define me, but it weighs on me as another drop in the \"you're different\" bucket. I've had several \"almost relationships\" in the past that all ended either in me being afraid and not pursuing any further or just sort of turned into friendships from rejection or lack of activity on my part. I've had opportunities for good potential relationships in the past I think, but I chose all the wrong paths and timings on the \"choose your own adventure\" story of my life as far as girls go. Sometimes I think I just want to have sex but I realize that it's a bit different than that. I just want intimacy with another human being. Closeness. Romance. Are these just ideas in my head? Maybe I don't want them in real life, but I think I do. \n\nThe thing about other people is that they're so difficult to get through to. It really does feel like there's a barrier between everyone and it's painful to get through like in Evangelion. I'm a bit awkward and need social practice but I think I have a fine baseline, it's just that it's always so painful and people never fully understand each other. I almost have a feeling of \"why bother\" going on. Yet, the feeling of romantic lack is strong enough that it keeps me up at night and prompts me to pour my heart out to strangers online (about a bi-monthly activity).\n\nWhat makes this even more of a joke is that it's fictional characters that always spark this desire in me. Anime, books, movies, specifically Phoenix Wright: Ace Attorney does this to me (please laugh, it's funny). Young female characters around my age in that game, that are literally meant to appeal to my sensibilities, do just that, and make me want *that* in real life. I know it's not real, and someone that acted as a character does would probably not even be appealing, but it still pulls all of those feelings I have towards the surface. I used to project those feelings more onto the character itself, and I suppose to some degree I still do, but more than anything I just feel the gap in my soul that I want someone else to fill. \n\nMy life though, is not very conducive to dating or this type of deep intimacy I claim to crave. I feel like I'm too fragile to \"try my luck\" and fail many times. Every time I've talked with a girl for an extended period of time and it went poorly I was out of commission for about 6 months emotionally, give or take. I just don't know if I can go through that everytime. During those times, I wasn't literally miserable 100%, but I felt pretty consistent dull pain in my chest along with the typical mix of positive and negative emotions. (Vagus nerve heartache is basically real physical pain, look it up if you don't believe me).\n\nThis feeling of \"lack\"... I also have heard that filling it with another person just won't help like I might think it will. What is someone else going to do for me really... maybe I should be happy first before trying to burden someone else with my worldview. Or better yet, close off my absurdist feelings about the world from everyone like I usually do. But then how do I meet someone? And who do I want anyway? A video game character? \n\nIn summary, my body is mocking me with a drive towards intimacy that's tainted with lust. I can't tell which is which most of the time and I also know it will just lead to pain like in the past. I know that this journey would be easier if I already had purpose or direction in my life, but as it stands that is not the case, and I'm not sure it ever will be. I don't say that as a fatalistic thing, but as an observation. I don't know if I will ever like *me* enough to expect someone else to. And so I have to live with the feeling in my chest forever, right?\n\nOr maybe I can learn to like myself?", "subreddit": "lonely"}

I grew up as a child of the state, bounced from abusive foster homes and group homes. My mother was a drug addict, my father wasn't in my life. I always had a hard time trusting people or getting close to others due to how I always was treated. When I turned 18 I was discharged from DCF (child protective services) as they could \"no longer help me\", and I was left to be on my own, homeless no family and no friends. I wanted to keep going, I thought if I put my all into finding my own happiness I would be rewarded for not giving up so that what I did. Got into Job Corps to get my GED, ended up leaving before I completed my vocation due to being bullied and harassed for being the only homeless kid there. So back on the streets I was once again, traveled a lot and did random odd jobs I found along the way to keep myself feed, all the while keeping that thought in my mind \" my hard work will pay off someday\".\n\nGot my first place at 22, it was a month to month place, not a great area but it was my first true home I felt. Then everything fell apart. I had found a job that was over night, while at work everything in my apartment was stolen, coming back to find what little I had worked so hard for was gone was heart breaking. I no longer felt safe in my own place, a place I had worked so hard for no longer felt like home, it felt like a cage. The stress had affected my sleep and my work performance, and just like that I had lost it all. I felt so lost, like I had failed because I wasn't strong enough to grasp what was going on and cope with it. So I decided that maybe this happened because I wasn't meant to be here, so I picked a random direction and just kept walking.\n\nI lived outside for what felt like forever, keeping my distance from others out of what felt like fear. I learned to make my own shelter, to find my own food and to never stay in one spot for more then a few day. I did this up until I had gotten badly hurt. I wont get into details, but I ended up with a large gash on the left side of my neck that ended up getting badly infected to the point others had taken notice of it. I was picked up by a stranger who had brought my to the hospital where I spent 3 weeks recovering. When I was allowed to leave they pointed me to a local homeless shelter, I never like the idea of going to a shelter but I thought \" maybe I can make some friends\" so I checked in.\n\nThe shelter was a nightmare, I was 24 when I was there and it felt like the longest 4 months of my life. The people I met were hollow shells of people, broken by life. I knew I didn't want to be like them, I wanted to be valued, to have self worth, to be happy. Then my lucky break happened, I got a job at a local gas station.\n\nBecause of this job I was able to stabilize, I had saved up while in the shelter to get an efficiency. I felt so happy, I felt like my hard work had paid off. I had achieved my childhood dream of having a home, even though it was empty, it was home and more importantly it was MY home, something I had earned. I didn't have a lot of money but I had a roof over me, and safe place to rest at last. I worked that job for 2yrs still I felt I should try to improve more.\n\nI got a job at an amazon warehouse, I felt like things were getting better, I had built up my little room was able to get a bed after 2yrs of sleeping on the floor. But there was this gnawing in the back of my mind, it still felt empty. No matter how hard I had tried to talk with others around me that connection just never formed. I had achieved a goal in my life, but I had no one to share it with.\n\nThen it happened, a year and a half of working and I was let go. I used what little I had saved up to hold on to my little place for as long as I could, but I had once again failed. Everything I had worked so hard for, gone just like that. It was starting to get cold outside. So I though \"I can't do another winter outside, where do I go\"?\n\nSo here I am, I ended up in Florida. I was able to find a job, and I currently live out a cheap motel while I try to figure out what to do. I've had a hard time sleeping more then 3hrs a night. All I do is work and sleep, I'm afraid to try to make a connection with others now. I'm in a relationship ( the one person I made a connection with at amazon). She stays with a co-worker about 15 miles from me, we don't get to spend time together and I've felt so disconnected from everyone around me, from the things I used to like. I feel like I've lost my drive and no longer know what to do.\n\nSorry if this is a long post, I don't expect anyone to read it all the way and I feel its a bit of a mess.

Obviously some FA'ers have a supportive family and friends. I'm not talking about them. I'm happy they have a support system. I'm talking about the FA'ers with no friends, and very little to no family support. When I say support, I mean people caring about you. \n\nI could be naive and think my co-workers care about me. Sure, some are nice to me and have done nice things for me just like I've done nice things for them. There is a difference between that and true friendship. That's what hurts me more than the lack of sex that FA'ers have to experience. Not having anyone to go out with on a lonely Friday Night hurts. \n\nThe truth is, I see people who care about each other. At work I see couples and families every day. I see close families and it seems alien to me. Wait, everyone is getting along? What is that? I've never experienced that. \n\nI can pretend that my coworkers and most of my family care. The truth is, nobody cares. It's harsh but true. I know some people will tell me how I'm being too negative. No, it's the truth. I'm not going to live in denial of the truth. If I fell into a bottomless pit tomorrow, people would say meh, and move on. \n\nThis is what hurts FA'ers the most. The lack of companionship that comes with having friends. Knowing your family cares enough about you to help you when you need it. Knowing that if you are single for a while and feeling depressed, you can go out with them to help you feel less depressed. \n\nLife isn't meant to be lived in isolation. Sure, some people are very introverted and prefer to be alone. I'm not talking about them because that's different. It's funny how many people I interact with at work yet am so isolated. I'm sure some outsider will tell me to go out and meet people like I didn't try that. Some outsider will say join hobby groups like i haven't tried that. Outsiders will say nobody will care about you until you care about yourself which is not true. We post countless examples of people who hate themselves yet have people who care about them. \n\nI saw a post about a woman giving her boyfriend non-sexual physical contact and the boyfriend starting to cry. That's probably what would happen to me if I ever had a woman do the same to me. It would be such an intense rush of emotions, they would overwhelm me. I don't what it's like to have that kind of companionship from a significant other or friend. \n\nThe sad part is, the only way I can get someone to even cuddle with me would be to imagine it.\n\nEdit: For anyone telling me to go to a therapist, they don't care either. You pay them to pretend to care. Their job is to pretend they care. Sure, they can help, but you are part of their job. I haven't had a positive experience with a therapist in a long time.\n\nEdit 2: I notice that every day I become more nihilistic.

The problem is that it's therfore against social conventions to be physically intimate with people unless you also want to be vulnerable and sexual (except family).\n\nWhy can't we just have as many, or as few people close to us as we want? This structure strengthens the patriarchy, it alienates people, and reducess productivity, health and happiness. \n\nAll the complexity and suffering, just because of these stupid social rules, that are maintained by media, education, advertisement, and parenting conventions. All that work, time and resources just so that there will be a bunch of people who are left feeling, alone.\n\nWe should change these practices, and advocate closeness. I mean we already talk about how schools are to sterile and authoriterian, how workplaces are often to alienating and once again, authoreterian, and how we are to isolated, and we already impliment this stuff as much as we can, in families, and romantic relationships.\n\nThere are of course exceptions to this practice, but they shouldn't have to be exceptions. People shouldn't have to be lucky to have a chance covering their psychological needs, we should constuct society as if covering human needs is a goal, after all isn't that why we banded together into societies to begin with?\n\nJust look at how vulnerable people can become online? Can you imagine that in order to get close to others, we feel a need to be so distanced that we won't be held accountable? It's so sad. And as a result of all this, people become alienated, and distrustful, and we have hostility to foreigners and rape culture and also depression, anxiety, eating disorders and disturbingly high suicide rates.\n\nWe need to chamge this, but to do so we need to go against the co ventions and band together. It's not just a personal issue it's a social one. We need each other to fix this, because we all need to feel like a part of the world we're living in. We all depend on each other, so it concerns me that you feel lonely, because you matter to me, because I need you. \n\nImagine schools where studens snuggled up to each other in class, and bussiness meetings where people introduced themselves to each other with a hug. Imagine if you could, without shame, ask a stranger if they were willing to talk about how terrible your day had been, and they hadn't been socialised too feel uncomfortable. Imagine if emotional hygiene was taught in schools, if we were encouraged to share our hardships, and to help out one another, like we do in every other part of society. I wish we lived in such a world. There would be so much less emotional confusion, alienation and coldness. Instead we would have community, relatedness, warmth and love.", "subreddit": "ForeverAlone"}

I was planning to ask her if I could get to know her better or hang out with her sometime, she was cute and seemed pretty cool so I wanted to see how things would go...but the second I said that I wanted to ask her something she replied \"I have a feeling whatever you're asking is going to make me uncomfortable\".

Even my friends who I know and see in person are starting to fade away from me. I don't know why. I need to find out what's wrong with me so I can improve myself so people stop pushing me away when they get bored of me. I'm nice to people and don't really have any arguments with anyone because I don't want to hurt anyone. I'm trying not to cry whilst writing this but I can't keep it in any longer. I don't remember the last time I cried about anything emotional but I can't keep going like this. I don't know what to do anymore. I have 4 friends left. And I can't trust any of them with any of this. I can't even trust them with a secret. They never message me unless they don't have anyone else to talk to. I'm bottom of their list when it comes to friends who they want to go out with or talk to. Basically I'm a worthless piece of shit that has no purpose in life. I will keep going and I won't end it, but I feel like all I have left is college work. But where will a levels take me? Yeah, I'll go to uni and might end up with a well paid job, but no amount of money could ever help me if I don't have anything else. I wish that one morning I just wouldn't wake up and that'd be the end. I won't commit suicide, and I'm not having any thoughts about comitting suicide, but I wouldn't care if I was to die. And I don't think other people would care either. I don't really know what else to type. I don't really want to go too far into my thoughts because I don't think you should have to see some of them. I'm not in a good place at the moment and I don't see how anything will ever improve. Even all of my friends that I've made online have stopped talking to me. All of them. I've had about 8 or 9 in total, about 3 of which I've made in the past 4 months, and every one of them has stopped talking to me. Sometimes they come up with an excuse as to why they can't talk to me, sometimes they fade away, and sometimes they just stop suddenly without an explanation. I don't blame any of them for this. It's something wrong with me - it's happened to many times for there to be any other reason. There's something wrong with me but no one has told me what, and I've thought about why people stop talking to me and I guess it's because I must be boring. Talking to me is about as good as eating the same meal every day - it's good at first but gets boring after a while and eventually you stop eating it completely. Maybe then there might be the occasional message/meal, but each time you remember how boring it is and why you stopped.\n\n I don't even know what I'm saying now.  I can't give up but I know I can't continue like this for much longer. I've been crying for the past 15 minutes typing this and I'll continue to cry once I've sent it, I can let myself cry for once over something emotional. It's ok to cry. I need to. \n\nI'm embarrassed to open up so much and to tell you all of this but I need to let it out and I don't have anyone.", "subreddit": "lonely"}

But I'm sharing it here on the off chance that it will help someone out of their misery from not having a girlfriend. \n\nThough I've (24M) never had a girlfriend, I can't say I'm truly FA because I've never really tried to approach girls. But even not knowing what it's like to have a girlfriend, the more I learn about what it takes to get a girlfriend, the less I feel the need to have one.\n\nWhat I thought I needed most to be fulfilled was female validation. It was supposed to be this deep sense of accomplishment, of meaning something. It was supposed to be a man's ultimate source of purpose. \n\nIn reality, female validation comes from having a girlfriend, and having a girlfriend comes from things that have no intrinsic value to me: looks, masculinity, money and status. That means female validation can be obtained by a criminal with nothing valuable to offer the world simply because the bones in his face are set a certain way. If even a person like that can get female validation, then it's no longer valuable to me. It's no longer a sign that I mean something. \n\nThrough this devaluation of female validation, I have devalued the idea of having a girlfriend. There are better ways for me to convince myself that I mean something to the world. \n\nP. S. Being human, I still have a need for physical contact and sex just as I have a need for food.

Suffice to say, the experience was - interesting.\n\nOverall, the most interesting videos I saw were from a guy named Dan Bacon, who has a kickass beard and offered a lot of advice that seemed to be relatively inoffensive.  I'd say it was less about pick-up artistry, and more about how just in general for men to interact with women so they don't come off as desperate, insecure, weak, or just plain weird.  Stuff that would probably be of some use to the late-bloomers on here, but not really any good for people here who are either autistic and/or disfigured (or in my case, both).  I noticed quite a few women had praise for the guy's advice as well, basically saying they wish men approached them the way this guy was talking about.  And he generally tended to focus on how to get interested in a woman to be in a relationship rather than the punp-and-dump tactic.\n\nThere were plenty of bad ones too, though.  Some posters had absurd advice about how to get your ex back (a bad proposition at any rate) and others that really encouraged bad behaviour, like cold approaching and engaging in manipulative, rather than persuasive behaviour.\n\nHaving said that, all the PUAs were hawking their book for $100+ dollars, which is probably a bad investment considering how many free tips they are giving out (I doubt the printed work is any new material).  And I can't speak to how successful any of these guys actually are with getting people to be more successful with women, which is probably a good thing to know before taking any of these guys seriously.  And I'd never recommend taking any of the silly \"boot-camps\" that some of these guys were promoting, those just seem like outright scams to me.\n\nOverall, it was an enlightening experience to kinda see that world from the outside.\n\nHave you ever had experience with this sort of thing?

I do very well in school and money isnt that big of a problem for me as I am in school on scholarship and stuff. But making friends and connections with people have been a negative for about 4 years now going on to 5. I dont want to say it has anything to do with looks as I may not be stunning but i have heard good things. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI have spent the best part of the past 4 years playing World of Warcraft alone in my room which was mainly where I got the most of my social interactions from. Now despite the picture I have painted for you I do not struggle speaking to people as I am in stem and have to present research in front of large crowds several times a semester, I have a small presentation this tuesday and a very large one on May 8th. I also dont have trouble speaking to people when its casual but do find it difficult to talk to people below surface level conversations, I find many people to be dull. I say dull meaning I dont share any interest with people mainly because there is nothing interesting about me and after I quit playing wow a few weeks ago I have spent a large chunk of my time sleeping in till my next class or watching The Office till I fall asleep again. Life honestly is starting to feel pointless but thats a whole other story.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMainly the biggest part of this post is this,\n\nAfter so much time being alone and mostly emotionless I met this girl at the gym. I noticed this girl back in freshman year but two weeks ago( now a junior going on to senior year) I asked her for her phone number. We went out last Wednesday and spent the whole night at a beach talking and drinking beers. Honestly the whole night was out of a movie and was just beautiful in my eyes. The girl is one of the most beautiful girls I had ever seen hence it taking so long to talk to her. Well over the course of the night she asked me how old I thought she was. She looked around 22 years old but she then told me she was 27. Honestly I was shocked as she just looked amazing and I would have never guessed. I understand a 21 year old and 27 wouldn't work long term although hell i would try if she would let me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe still hung out and laughed and drank for a good 3 more hours after she told me here age, we even spoke for a few more days after texting each day and things. Honestly i thought maybe there was something there, she was sending me cute photos of her ( nothing explicit just her smiling and of her cats and stuff). However today (Sunday) she texted me saying things wont work out and we should stop talking you get the idea, it felt so random.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhat this message showed me though was how badly I actually longed for affection, as corny as it sounds but I hadnt really thought of any other person the way I had thought about this girl and I only knew her for 3 days. I actually feel like something is missing now. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHas anyone else ever experienced this, I actually used to think there was something wrong with me because I didnt really show much emotion and now its like Im feeling them all at once.  She still has another two years on her masters program and I have another year till graduation and am already thinking of getting a pHD just not at this school but at least ill still see her for another year as I see her at the gym daily but it still hurts.

We don't take their advice. Imagine being that full of yourself. Like I said in my thread about outsiders being condescending, imagine what it's like to actually think, I'm so great and can help these losers. They just need to listen to me. They haven't heard what I have to say 1,000 times. If someone comes onto this sub and claims to want to help but acts like they are better than you because they aren't FA, I would doubt their intentions. Obviously some outsiders do want to help. I'm not talking about them. I'm talking about the ones who just want to feel better about themselves and coming on this sub to do that. At least I tried to help those losers. I'm so great. I took time out of my busy day to try and help them. They didn't want my help. Now, remember what I said about showering and therapy. Nobody has told you to shower more because obviously FA'ers don't shower.\n\nThe older FA'ers on here obviously know about being talked to that way because we have been talked to that way for a long time either from family or therapists. Sometimes both. The younger FA'ers may not have as much experience but they know when someone is talking down to them. The younger FA'ers on here seem to be highly intelligent. They know more than people think. Outsiders will accuse us of telling them it's over for them. They say we tell a teenager to give up. In reality, we tell them to not give up. They still have time. Sure, they could become old, bitter, FA'ers but it's not over for them. \n\nSometimes we just want to be left to ourselves. If someone wants advice, they will ask for it. I don't understand what these drive by therapists are trying to do. Most of the time especially when a younger poster says it's over for them, they are venting and aren't giving up in the sense that some older FA'ers have given up. \n\nI'm sure they will downvote me.

There were hot couples, nerdy couples, weird couples, fat couples, ugly couples, normal couples. I do believe there is someone out there for everyone, the problem with us FAs is that the person that would connect with us is not as 'common', so we have a lower percentage of meeting them. Since many of us do not have good social capital with large connections, we don't meet as many people making it even harder for us. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMany people meet their SO through friends, work, or school. Contrary to what PUA tell you, I would estimate only about 20% of people met their SO through cold approach/online apps. We just got unlucky that we did not meet our SO during school, work, or friends. When people say you just have to 'be yourself', I agree with that. Its just that the amount of people who would like us for who we are is lower and more rare than normies. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAdditionally, there are some FAs here than have good social capital - lots of friends, good family, and are still FA. My heart goes out especially for these types. They have done everything right according to normies, but are still FA. Is it because they had a bad haircut, didn't lift, bad personality, didn't shower, didn't see a therapist? No - for these especially, it is just sheer bad luck.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFor example, there was this one guy I used to work with. He was a cool guy, confident, outgoing, had lots of friends, went to parties/clubs, and went to the gym. However, he could not find a girlfriend. I remember we had dinner one night, and I asked him how his dating life was going. He paused for a bit, and just said he still searching. I could then see the sadness, pain, and emptiness in his eyes. This guy was doing way better than me socially, but he still couldn't find a girlfriend, that is just blatant bad luck. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBefore anyone starts attacking me, I am not saying FA people should just give up and blame bad luck. It is up to the person if they want to try to escape FA. I am just saying that people underestimate how much luck plays into people lives. For me, I know I have a successful career due to good luck. Because a manger decided to give me a chance for an internship I was not qualified for, I was able to get my foot into the door. That internship led me to a full time job, and with that good job on my resume, it opened even more doors for other good companies. All because I was lucky the manager gave me a chance. It wasn't that I studied 10000 hours to get a 4.0. Who knows, if I never got that internship I could be unemployed right now living with my parents.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAll in all, fate gave us a bad hand, it is up to us to determine how we play it. Some of us will succeed and escape FA. However, others unfortunately, will not escape and be suck here forever. I do sincerely hope that everyone here will be able to escape, even if it is just temporary. I wish everyone the best of luck.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTLDR: Being FA has a lot to do with bad luck. Luck is not 100% to blame, and it is up to people to decide if they want to try to escape. People however underestimate how much luck plays into people's lives.", "subreddit": "ForeverAlone"}

My parents are divorced but that's pretty common. Up to 2 to 3 years ago In sophomore year of high school I felt like a normal kid. Dating, making friends, doing shit 15 year olds do. Never drugs or dumb shit I was always against being an idiot. At this time I started to become full of myself and developed a very different philosophical religion. Where I wanted to be more than just a normal boring person. I wanted to be something but not something to people. Something bigger than us humans. Because of gaining this mindset I started thinking I was so much better than everyone else and that they did not understand what the world really is. That it is a neverending die repeat and you have limited time to live a life worth living. I pushed many of my friends away because they became nothing to me but mindless meat suits with no understanding of life. Now let me remind that I never acted this way in person, only thought it and on the outside I would consider myself very good at faking personality. High school went by and it is almost a year after I graduated. Now I am at a point where I work a decent amount to pay for what I need to pay for with a bit over to try and entertain myself with games. But, the thing is, is that it's tough not being showing people what you really think for years. Faking every reaction and interaction you have to be politically correct in this society. Currently I am waiting for something to happen. I believe if I am meant for something than something higher will grant me it. If not then oh well. But thinking this way is very lonely. And I know loneliness is just a emotion created in the brain and means nothing but it is has to get rid of. If you've read this whole thing so far I would expect you think I'm fucking insane and I might agree. But its who I've been for a while but I could change it because it fucking sucks. Everyone had a goal in life and for me I've never had one. But now I do and it seems impossible because of how I am. I just want someone like me to talk to and be with. To be each others lost halves until mortality consumes us. I'm not a weird guy I would think I'm actually very energetic and talkative. I love a good story. Some of my favorite films are Death Note and Butterfly Effect. I feel kinda twisted typing this because at first I was at a God complex but now I'm just lonely and want my other half.

None of this came to light until my parents divorced last year. Then I realized how much my Mom had been covering for him.

All my life that is what it has been, nobody giving me a chance and overlooking me. I'm 32 this year, a male. I'm gay but also lean towards women on occasion. I ain't fat, if anything underweight. Thin. I relate quite well to the rejection of weight. Overweight men and women are always complaining about being rejected because of their weight, how often do you hear skinny person complain? Well here is one complaining. Skinny shaming is a thing.\n\n  \nEveryone around me tells me I am attractive and handsome, I look good for my age. Most place me between 21 and 25. I don't think I am that attractive. I am introvert and find it difficult to approach people offline so I spent a lot of my time via online dating sites. I spent ten years on them. All of them. Looking for that supposed equal that supposedly exists. Sure I met people, many, all over the planet, they didn't stick around. Sure I have been in relationships, but the last one I was in was 2013. Since then I maybe net one or two dates a year. Sex is rare too.\n\n  \n I've had many tell me how sexy, cute, hot I am. I have even had a slight few tell me that I might be too attractive. I don't think I am that attractive. But if I am, you think being attractive is easy livin and gets you plenty of lays? No. If it did I wouldn't be on here bitching about not getting what I want.  I've been on plenty of dating sites and hookup apps. I've had people tell me they want to date, fuck, sleep with me, etc. Every time I ask if they want to meet up and do so, they balk, they cop out.  \n\n\nOffline? I've tried. I've tried Pride events, LGBT+ meet ups, I've tried bars. I've tried social groups. I've tried everything. Nobody wants to chat. They just push me away. I'm not a mean spirited person. I wear a smile on my face everywhere I go. I'm friendly, chill, live and let live. I wear my heart on my sleeve, I am involved with my community. I have a nice job, a place of my own, family and friends. I got issues, sure, I admit that. Everyone has issues, but those are kept in check and under control.\n\n  \nBut its just... nothing. Nothing works. And I am so fucking alone. As stated earlier I often feel overlooked. I have met people from other parts of the country and planet and they said the  same to me. They said that people are shitty. That I am a handsome and respectable guy who deserves to be with someone. My family and friends say the same.\n\n  \nI know a lot of people out there find themselves in the same position as I do. But they always have something holding them back. Something that they need to change about themselves. They are the source of their own problems. Me? I honestly believe there are some of us, like myself who no matter what we do, no matter whom we speak to, no matter how nice and friendly we are. Nobody gives a shit. There is literally nobody out there for us. Some of us are truly made to be alone. And I am one of them and that hurts.", "subreddit": "lonely"}

One day, a girl comes to me on my class and says ''hey there's a friend of mine who has a crush on you c:''\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nnow, I want to make clear.. I was a depressed lonely kid at the time. I was full of hatred for some reason too (still am. Perhaps as a defensive mechanism, i don't know really)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo all I answered was ''I do not care about your friend'' (I didn't know either of them, obviously)\n\nShe instantly let the smile run away from her face and looked at me with a sad/angry look and said ''didn't need to be so rude''\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nYeah...fuck me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt doesn't stop there tho\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFFW a few days later, it's break time, and I'm standing there looking into the nothing (yes.. I was that guy, the guy that you could mistake for a tree) and 3 girls come at me, the girl from before, the girl who had a crush on me and another friend. The girl from before says ''hey, this is the girl that has a crush on you''\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI honestly didn't know how to react, didn't know what to say, so I just put on a angry/annoyed face and stared at her soul  (the girl who had a crush on me) for 5 seconds. She had a smile on her face that died as soon as I looked at her like that.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm not going to lie, she was.. not good looking (and I'm the type of guy that have low standards). But that was NOT the problem, at all. I honestly don't know why I did what I did. Maybe it was just a self defense mechanism, as I said, as at the time (and to this day) I was SO AFRAID of getting hurt and/or making connections. Or the fact that she came to me with 2 other friends, and I was super shy and anxious and that made me nervous (I coudn't talk to one girl, and she comes at me with an army of girls?!). Anyway, whatever is the reason, I did what I did.. And she left.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnd never came back. Wich is OBVIOUSLY for the best. From now on, everytime I saw her, she looked pretty depressed. I can't help but feel like shit about it. My biggest fear is that  I probably made her pretty insecure about her appearance or something like that, wich well.. As I said she wasn't good looking, but that's 100% not the reason I did what I did.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSometimes I think ''hey, if she walked up to me alone maybe I woudn't have reacted that way'' but then I think that I wouldn't. Honestly even at the time, I was so fucking broken and afraid. I still see her from time to time (I think it's her, she has a twin sister who probably hates me), and last wednesday I found out where she lives. I wish I could say sorry but it's been 3+ years, probably not even worth it and nothing good can come out of it. I mean, if I could go back I would do things differently. I would NOT like, ''giver her a chance''. Honestly I do think it would be horrible, considering my situation. But I would definitelly do things different.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI really hope that I didn't mess her up so much, and that she had some luck with someone better. for real.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\#Edit: Just to clarify: this is ***NOT*** a rant about ''throwing a chance away'', but rather a rant about a shitty thing I did..", "subreddit": "ForeverAlone"}

On the other side there were at least 10 grad students watching us. Since FA was causing my depression I talked about being FA. If one of the grad students thought they could give new ideas to me, they would pass a note to the therapist through the door. Each one told me to either go out more, join hobby groups, stop being so hard on myself, tell me to stop obsess over being FA, or other types of advice we have been told lots of times on here. At the time I was younger and would try advice given to me but even then I knew that they were giving advice that I had already been told lots of times and not respecting my reality. I'm not being too hard on myself if that's what my reality is. If you get rejected every single time for years, saying you are unattractive isn't being hard on yourself if you are. I have a feeling none of them knew what FA was and thought it was a result of depression instead of being a cause because people mix those up all the time. I know they wanted to help but it's difficult to treat someone if you don't know what the cause of their depression is or get them mixed up.\n\nTL;DR, had a therapy session in front of a group of grad students that were also becoming therapists.

I am autistic, no friends or relationship. I cannot really read people/situations well, and so my policy is essentially \"speak when spoken to\" and never to initiate. Unlike most here I think I do prefer being alone, at least compared to the alternative. Talking to others is very tiring for me, I do not think I am really cut out for friendships or a relationship.\n\nSomething happened a few days ago, during the Easter break period. Campus was mostly empty, I guess lots of people go back to their families during this time. I was in the cafeteria area (cafe itself was closed but you can still use the tables and chairs). I was sitting alone studying.\n\nA girl in my class came up to me, which kind of caught me off guard, nobody has done this before. She said hi and I responded likewise. She asked if she could sit here (a couple of seats away from me). I said \"Sure\". So she sat, coffee in one hand, phone in the other. I continued to try and study.\n\nI'm not great with eye contact, I could only just see her in my peripheral vision. She continued to look at her phone, I tried to continue to study. Absolute silence. This went on for 5+ minutes, maybe even 10. She eventually stood up, said \"See ya\" and I replied likewise, she then left.\n\nNow I'm in two frames of mind\n\n1. I was an asshole and shouldve said *something* but I really had nothing to say. I could've asked about her break,  but that would've led to her potentially asking the same, and I don't know how I could've answered. Also I didn't particularly *want* to talk.\n\n2. My other way of thinking is that I did nothing wrong, as she was the one who approached me. Why would she do that, out of the 50+ seats she could have chosen? We have never spoken previously and know nothing of each other. It's not physical attraction, believe me lol \n\nI try to be pleasant when spoken to, but looking back I probably came off as anything but here. What would you have done in my situation? If I were to by chance see her again  (unlikely as the class we share is now over) should I say anything?", "subreddit": "ForeverAlone"}

Some involuntarily celibate  men say they just want a wife who will cook dinner and be there for them and they want children. They believe they can't achieve this due to their looks. \n\nUnder societies with arranged marriages, your looks aren't that important. Your parents find you a spouse through the family  (a distant cousin, gross I know) or a family friend or a colleagues' son/daughter. All you have to do is look at a picture of that person and learn a little bit of their education/career/skills and then you choose whether you want to marry them or not. You don't need to go through the dating process where you'll be rejected, you just need to say yes or no and your parents need to get along with their parents. You would also have a social network automatically because you would be joining up with your spouses' family and friends. \n\nThe downsides would be that the person wouldn't like you in reality and would feel pressured by the culture. A woman would especially feel pressured to say yes to a suitor if she is in her mid twenties because that would be considered \"older.\" Also, you might not actually get along with the potential partner and will have to put up with them anyway due to cultural pressure. \n\nSo, would you want to have an arranged marriage to solve your dating problems or not?", "subreddit": "ForeverAlone"}

{"post_id": "bj8okj", "created_utc": 1556658559, "title": "The reason why it's so hard to climb out of friendless FA is because of these 2 concepts - social action and social content", "author": "worthlessvirginbum", "self_text": "**Social action** is what you do with other people, when you engage in socialization. It's not hobbies, it's things like gathering at someone's house party; going shopping with friends; travelling together to new place/country; doing non-skill required things like wakeboarding with friends.\n\n\n**Social content** is the result of social action, it is a resource and part of your life capital that you use when interacting with others, this bringing your social value high. It's the social life experience. \n\n\n\nNow, here's the problem, the longer you stay friendless and miss out on social action and thus not creating any social content, the harder it gets to interact with other normal people, since the gap in experiences increases.\n\n\nWhen you go on a date with a girl and she's younger than you are, you are supposed to dominate the conversation with your social content, tell fun stories, be able to engage and add comments to her information about herself, provide examples of how you did certain things with other people. Same goes to basically any other communication, be that at work or with acquitances somewhere at your regular hobby like gym. Chit chat is the core concept of successful socialiazation, and chit chat stems from having social content to talk about. The more social content you have, the easier you will connect with other people on sensual level and the more respect and status you will get among them, thus the more friends and new contancts you will create.\n\n\n\nNow another thing is that, when you try to penetrate already existing social circle, it all starts with one person who invites you to hang out with his/her friends or to do some fun things. Now that's where you normall expected to pay back and return the favor, if a guy called you to his birthday, he'd expect you would call him to yours (how you gona do that if you dont celebrate birthdays since you are friendless FA). If a girl called you to hang out at some quest room with her friends, she expects you'd invite her to do something fun as well with some other people, not dating wise, friendship wise. \n\n\n\nIf you are past initial stage, when social circles are initially formed like school and college, you have to bring some value (good looking, sharp sense of humor or be the soul of the company) to penetrate and be allowed to hang out with other people. Otherwise at best you can count on acquitances, whom you will see once a month to catch up on each others live. Which isnt even close to how normal people live. They socialize daily in big group chats in messengers and hang out every other night at someone's appartments drinking wine, playing cards, playing mafia, watching tv series together etc.", "subreddit": "ForeverAlone"}

I've been reading this thread for a short while, and I'd like to make my first post. It's sort of a rant, so if you're not interested, I understand. I've been trying to know thyself and find out what kind of girl I really want. I believe I know now, and although I truly believe she's out there, I don't believe she's online. I have been looking online for the last year and haven't found anyone to write home about that's close by. My dilemma is that while I could think of some places she could be, the fact that I'm completely socially inept prevents me from going and looking; not to mention the fact that I hate being alone in public (It feels worse than being alone by myself). It's not that I can't socialize with anyone, it's just that I need repetitive socialization to come out of my shell, as small talk is excruciating. I'm an ISTJ, if that helps. I don't feel I have ridiculously high standards; I just want a sweet country girl that:\nis a bit on the conservative/Traditionalist side\nChristian/Spiritual\nMinimalist or at least not too materialistic\nNaturist, and enjoys being in nature vs being in civilization\nHomeopathic\nVegan/vegetarian -- as I'm a vegan\nHumorous\nLikes or can at least tolerate Trance/EDM and/or big band music\nIs into conspiracy theories/facts\nRomantic\nHonest\nEnjoys learning/deep conversations\nBlonde -- preferably, but any hair/skin color will do\nFit/slim\nGood hygiene\nMaybe likes the art deco era.\n\nBeing slightly nerdy, I don't even care if she isn't into video games, Star Wars, or anime; or if she watches old classic films like I do. I don't know; maybe this IS a tall order. I know my depression injects super negative thoughts in my mind, I try to keep positive as I'm very grateful for what I DO have but you guys know what depression is like. Not to get too religious but, Jesus said to be in this world but not of it. In the midst of my depression I've found that I don't truly feel OF this world. I don't fit in anywhere. Everything today is too 'plastic,' and not many people seem into the deep questions/discussions; or even the little things like staring up at the sky (sunset or stars) and the wonder of the wilderness or a perfectly brewed cup of tea. There's not much authenticity anymore. I've tried praying/meditation, binaural beats and subliminals, but never fully committed to the subliminals or visualization. I'm trying to now, though. I've even seriously considered mail order brides, but the cost and the travel are 2 COLOSSAL deterrents. What do you all think? Do you think I want too much? I feel like the only marriage I'll ever have is to my job, which I never, ever wanted (the commitment I mean, not the job itself); and the only intimacy I'll ever have is via porn (which I know is NOT good considering the epidemic and the NoFap resistence) or a Realdoll. I think that I'm decent looking (slim, 5'3\") maybe a 6 or 7 out of 10, but what does it matter if I can't find anyone? It feels weird pouring my heart out to complete strangers, but I don't know what else to do, or even how to come out of my shell.\n\nThank you for taking the time to read this and allow me to vent, a little.", "subreddit": "ForeverAlone"}
