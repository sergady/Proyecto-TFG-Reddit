I was surprised at the time but never thought something that banal would appear so significant now, like a major life event.  Since then I could count the number of times possibly single women showed a friendly interest in me  on one hand.  Less than five instances, excluding middle-aged co-workers and married/partnered up friends-of-friends.\n\nIf I happened to get into a conversation with someone, invariably they wouldn\u2019t ask questions, change the topic or push the conversation along. I  tried to get to know women at university, work, clubs; but if they weren't much older or  already taken (and knew that I knew that) this is how the interactions would go.\n\nI get the reasoning behind not wanting to give off  wrong signals, but still it's almost zero interest in over 20 years of adult life.  I\u2019ve got my act together a bit appearance wise, done the gym thing,  taken up a few more social hobbies, accumulated   3  degrees now, have a  career path, and a house (admittedly inherited but still has to be maintained). But being a functional adult  means nothing.  You'd think after all this time *someone* would be bored or lonely enough to make some  half-arsed effort  at  conversation.\n\nI\u2019m actually jealous of the guys who get friendzoned;  jealous that  single girls/women were comfortable enough to have them as \"friends\" in the first place. Even if just to  use them. To me  it still seems like  a kind of validation.\n\nAt some point if I  live to be elderly I\u2019m  probably going to have to rely on female nurses or caregivers, who will no doubt suppress their disdain/disgust for me in order to do their jobs and appear professional. As  good a reason as any to end it before getting into that state.", "subreddit": "ForeverAlone"}

Now I'm stuck on a platform where I have no friends.\n\nI do have a couple friends irl, but we don't talk very often. By \"we\" I mean they don't talk to me very much; mostly each other as they have a lot in common between the three of them. Also, they are free to hang out whenever and have constant access to rides. I on the other hand have a little one and while he is my life and I enjoy every second of him, I'm not as free to drop what I'm doing and go.

On that first date everything went fine so **we agree on a second date on Monday.**\n\n# And now, on Monday\n\nWe went to a hamburger place. So far so good, conversational is casual. Then we decide to go to another coffee place so she could read my *\"astral chart\"* (she's really into astrology).\n\n**Conversational turns a little bit more personal,** we share some intimate information and I actually suggest (in a kinda kidding manner) that if she really wants me to open up more that soon she at least should buy me a drink first. She agreed, but then she remembered she had a Skype meeting with an associate of hers around 10:00 pm so we just left the coffee place and I thought we should just call it a day.\n\nHere is where things will get confusing, when we left the coffee place we started walking towards her department (which it was at a walking distance from the coffee place) and I didn't know what was gonna happen, since she told me she was going to get busy with work stuff, but when we arrived she actually invited me to come in so, that was good, right?\n\n# Her house\n\nSince I was carrying my laptop with me we agreed that I could just work on my own stuff while she did hers, and once again everything went fine. Skype meeting was over and she got a six pack beer from the fridge.\n\nWe talked and talked and drank a little, and **we started to cuddle, but we didn't kiss**. So, it gets late, it's 2:00 am and I don't have a car and she tells me *\"it's too late for you to call an Uber, you should sleep here\"* and I think *\"all right, she'll bring me some blankets and I'll just sleep in the sofa\"* but as she reaches for the stairs she turns back and calls me *\"come on, my bedroom is upstairs\"* and I'm like *\"wait, what? is this happening?\"*. In her bedroom there's just one bed (obviously) so she just put on some pjs and gets into it.  I do the same (with my pants and shirt on), what else was I supposed to do?\n\n**So, what was the situation now? she just literally invited me to sleep with her, in the same bed? was it code for sex? isn't this how it works? But we hadn't even kissed yet, was I supposed to just go for it? we were in the same bed, after all. Doesn't that imply some sort of intimacy?**\n\nBut here's the thing. She didn't seem open to it, you know? maybe it was indeed late for an Uber and she didn't have enough sheets for me to sleep in her sofa. It sounds dumb, but plausible. There was a lot going on that made me think that *making a move wasn't the smartest move*. Imagine, if I tried it and she rejected me, it would've been a long and awkward night or just would be forced to call that goddamn Uber.\n\n# The actual sleeping part\n\nOkay, getting to the point (and I'm sorry if you think I wasted your time with the previous 5 or 6 paragraphs). **We slept together, but we didn't have sex.** In fact, we didn't even kiss. She was on her side of the bed and I was in mine. And that's where *Chekhov's pills* come into play (or the lack of them); I cannot sleep without them. I need them or I just lay on the bed eyes wide open until birds start to chirp.\n\nShe fell asleep almost immediately, and there I was, a *Forever Alone*, who is not used to touch or be touched by anyone ever (I'm really lonely, not just in the *love department*, but more in the *every aspect of my life department*) next to her. Can you imagine? She was centimeters away from me, our arms slightly touching and me with a case of insomnia. Excuse the corniness but *she was so close, and yet so far*.\n\n**Yes, I spent 8 hours laying next to her, confused and frustrated. No, she didn't invite me to sleep with her so we could have sex, but because I was such a non-sexual being, inoffensive, and devoid of all manliness that she didn't care I would even try to make a move on her. She knew I wouldn't dare.**\n\n# But what happened next day, dude?\n\nSo, it's next day, she wakes up and mentions she's got a meeting at 10:00 am. And as I was laying next to her I think to myself *\"alright mate, time's running up. Are you gonna make a move or what?*\" so I finally go for a kiss.\n\nAnd then what happened, you ask? the tension right now is just unbearable, you say? Well, she accepts it but she's not very reactive. But why? Well, that's when **she actually gives me the totally not bullshit argument** that *\"I'm not actually is not looking for a relationship right now (bitch please, I met you on fucking Tinder) so it's totally me not you\"* and I don't fucking buy it and insist that that answer is not really enough for me.\n\nAs she felt pressured to actually cut the bullshit, she gave me several good reasons (what I'm trying to say is, despite her mixed messages, I don't blame her) but it comes down to this: **insecurity.**\n\nAnd you know, it hurts but she's right, I'm fucking insecure as hell (can you blame me? of course I'm a mess, I'm battling with severe depression and I haven't been with a girl in ages). I'm beating myself up all the time, complaining and just being plain negative about me and about life.\n\nIt was confusing for her as well, so that's why I don't resent her, she wants something more with me but also, I gave her red flags that she just couldn't ignore. **I actually appreciated a lot her honesty**, instead of just sticking to the *\"it's not you, it's me\"* bullshit from the beginning.\n\n# So, please, could you just tell us what happened at the end? it's getting fucking late and I need some fucking sleep, jeez\n\nAlright, things actually ended that day in a hopeful note, kinda.\n\nBefore saying goodbye, I told her:\n\n&gt;*\"You know what, you're right, I have a lot of work to do to better myself. And I'm going to do it. I'll get better, I'll get past this. Being toxic sucks, man, and I'm really getting tired of it. I actually want to get better. And I'll do it for me, but you know what?

We kissed again, but not like the last time. **This time she was the one that kissed me,** she was actually going for it. It felt so different. She got a little turned on by that, I could notice it and it felt amazing.\n\n# Epilogue\n\n**We agreed to continue talking and seeing each other.** I haven't seen her since (this was actually just two days ago) but we have been talking. Things are good between us at the moment.\n\nWhat will happen? I don't know. I feel she actually wants something deeper with me, but she also needs to consider what's better for her (a little bit of context, she's 29 and I'm 27, we're reaching an age when we may need to prefer stable relationships to one night stands. And I say we may, because actually whatever thing I can get is more than enough for me).\n\nI don't know what will happen in the future, but I was honest with her when I said that **I wanted to get better** for me and for her, but especially for me. I mean, maybe when I'm healthy enough I'll just get rid of this horrible *oneitis* I just caught and get a girl who is not into astrology. Who knows?\n\nAnyway, stay tuned for more *shenanigans*. Or don't, or downvote it, I don't care. I do this mainly as a form of **therapy for myself**. I needed to express it so I could be less confused about what I feel.\n\nBut, if you made it so far, **thank you**.  Get yourself a treat because you deserve it, this was a long post.\n\nEdit.- Formatting.", "subreddit": "ForeverAlone"}

You would think I would be over the moon right?  \n\n\nWrong.   \n\n\nI just find it so hard to be happy when after all these years, I still have no SO. To add salt to the wound, I've been in College longer than pretty much any other degree surrounded by hundred's of other students and yet somehow I never had anyone interested in me. I didn't even go on one date throughout all those years! Thinking about it now, I find it hard to believe that I could've done that, and it makes me question, did I just waste all my college years? Now meeting people is gonna be even harder to do since I'm out of college and on top of that I will be guaranteed to have a busy schedule, and really, I just don't see things ever changing.   \n\n\nMany of you would consider me still \"young\" (23, turning 24 at the end of the year), but I really think I'm going to hit 30 and be in the same situation.  These days, I find myself thinking more and more about what's wrong with me. No dates at this age means it's pretty much a given that I'm ugly. I'm fortunate enough to have quiet a few friends that I can hang out with regularly, female and male (although all the female friends are in relationships of their own or there is just no interesting from either of us romantically), so surely my personality can't be that horrible right? Am I just too entitled and should just give up? To me, it feels like going through medical school is a sign that I still have hope and maybe it would be best for me to just leave and be homeless or something. Sounds extreme, but it seems at this point, just having no hope is better than going through life feeling like it's a constant uphill battle. ", "subreddit": "ForeverAlone"}

In this post: [https://www.reddit.com/r/ForeverAlone/comments/ab5n1z/welp\\_im\\_gonna\\_do\\_it/](https://www.reddit.com/r/ForeverAlone/comments/ab5n1z/welp_im_gonna_do_it/), I committed to said exercise, in addition to outlining some parameters. Because few bars are open, and few people attend bars, on weekdays, however, I have since amended the exercise; now aiming to speak to three women on Fridays, three on Saturdays and three on Sundays, for the four weekends of January, for a total of 36. The following post comprises my tenth such account, my account of the night of 01/02/2019.\n\nVery little to report tonight. I went to the bar, I had a drink, I spoke to two women (if I don\u2019t meet my quota of three on any given night, it generally comes down to the fact that far more men were present than women, making finding an opening difficult), I asked one of them for their number, I received it. Everyone left, leaving the bar deserted, quite early, and although someone invited me to come with them to another bar, it was a long way away, and I need to get up early tomorrow to attend to some errands, so I could not accept, and went home.\n\nSomeone took a photo (see below) of me seated between two attractive women (including the one whose number I got) which made me look like a player, but that\u2019s about the most interesting thing that happened. No major shower thoughts\u2026 except that it never ceases to amaze me how completely effortless getting a woman\u2019s number is compared to how hard I thought it would be and how hard so many men make it out to be. Also, she specifically mentioned ringing to arrange a time to meet, so it looks like, as early as one week after my previous date, I may have *already* gotten another one. Dudes, I\u2019ve said it once, I\u2019ll say it again: join Meetup, shower, shave, apply deodorant, comb your hair, put clean clothes on, attend session, sit next to woman, introduce yourself, talk to her about banal shit for 15 \u2013 30 minutes, ask for her number. That\u2019s it. That\u2019s all there is. Short of them coming up to and offering it to you themselves the second you walked through the door, there is effectively no way this could be easier or simpler.\n\nGonna be trying something a little different tomorrow night\u2026\n\nIn case anyone doesn\u2019t believe me, here\u2019s the photo:\n\nhttps://i.redd.it/sj1721woxxd21.jpg\n\n**Tally:**\n\nGoal: 36.\n\nPoints: 16.\n\nBrownie points: 4.\n\nRejections: 0.\n\nPhone numbers: 3.\n\nDates: 1.\n\nAgain; ***polite***, ***constructive***, ***good faith*** suggestions are appreciated.", "subreddit": "ForeverAlone"}

The only way to not feel lonely is to... well not feel lonely. Which means you wouldn't feel alone.\n\nWhile this can mean being accepting of solitude i think as social animals we all sort of need a social group psychologically.\n\n Which is why i wish there were sort of group homes for it or an organization that meets. You'd have people struggling with social anxiety and anything else that causes or contributes to general loneliness. And you'd have legitimately a supervised party. With maybe some therapists or professionals, but also just very friendly people as coaches. Cause if you're alone for long enough, being social is so hard. \n\nWhat if someone could actually sit there and say \"hey, thats a great conversation topic and you're doing really well\" to reassure us or say \"hey, calm down there you're getting a bit excited\" or even pull us out our shell and ease us into conversations. \n\nBetter yet the coaches would even have group chats and personal messages occasionally to hit every aspect. \n\nEssentially training us to be social and giving us a group of people who all understand it. I think it could help social anxiety a lot, but also social akwarness and other struggles. For that internalized loneliness where people feel lonely even around others while acting normal; having a therapist or psychologist on hand to directly observe them could be so helpful. They could work to determine the underlying causes of that emotion and develop a treatment unique to those individuals. \n\nDoes anyone else think that would be helpful? Is there something like that? A sort of group dedicated to these issues. Cause its becoming enough of an epidmic to warrant it imo.", "subreddit": "lonely"}

JFL  more guys like short girls than tall girls so how is that a win? \n\n- I hate being facially ugly. Just why? Growing up (and now) I have had to deal with so much garbage because of my face, it\u2019s like a never ending nightmare. I just don\u2019t understand why I couldn\u2019t look like everyone else? Plastic surgery might make me look like an alien. No matter how nicely I try to dress my face ruins it. \n\n- I hate my build in general. At first I thought I was a pear, but after losing weight I look like a triangle. Being a triangle in combination with my height makes me look like a guy. When I posted a pic on a different sub a ton of people asked me if I was a guy. Also two people irl confused me for a guy (even though I don\u2019t not dress that way).

I'm here because I'm a 21 year old senior in college, and I have not had a single date or anything here in the almost 4 years I've been in school. I'm not sure if I fully count as forever alone because I dated in high school, but things were different then, which I won't get into. However, I believe my major problem is that I'm extremely short, just under 5 ft tall. I'm decently attractive facially, I always try to dress well, I'm fit, but I can't help but feel like none of that matters when I am at this height. Not a single woman has shown interest in me I don't think since I've been in college, which I feel like is really bad.\n\nBecause of my height, and the fact that I'm super busy as an engineering major, I also never make an effort to get to know women, or go out and meet women. I can't help but think about how different things would be if I were a foot taller, and it makes me so upset. I feel like I was given a horrible curse and without it, I'd probably have a pretty normal dating life. So it makes me not even want to try.\n\nI've been planning on trying out Tinder or OkCupid for a few months now out of desperation, and I've even chosen the pictures and written bios and such. But I'm scared to start using them, because I haven't had any experience romantically with women in so long, and my height is shocking. I would break the news about my height after matching someone though, just so I at least have the chance to maybe change the person's mind.\n\nIs trying online dating a terrible idea? Should I just accept that I'm not going to end up with someone at my height? Like I know I have to accept the cards I've been dealt, but it sucks thinking about what could have been, I guess. I'm graduating in just a few months and I'd do anything to have some kind of date or anything, because once I graduate I know it'll get a thousand times harder. Is my height the biggest problem?

I've been a long time lurker on reddit but I've never felt compelled to make an account before. I don't really know if there's even any advice for this. I guess it's more of a vent/rant. I just needed to get all of this out and I don't really have anyone to talk about it with. I couldn't stop crying tonight and so I thought maybe putting all of this somewhere might help.\n\nI'm 23 years old in my first year of medical school and I feel like I have nobody. I've never felt like this before. I was treated for mild depression when I was younger but I really thought it was better. It was for years but now it's not.\n\nCollege was great for me. I had a lot of friends, was involved, in a sorority, etc. I never once felt lonely. Every second of free time I had I spent with friends. We went out, went to parties, hung out at coffee shops, studied together, etc.\n\nI remember my first day of classes here and feeling like I was living a dream. Being a doctor is the only thing I've ever wanted to do. I never wanted to be a teacher or a pilot or an architect or whatever else kids want to be. I just wanted to be a doctor like my dad. He's an orthopedic surgeon. I remember begging him to make time to come to my class in middle school on the day people parents came and talked about their careers. I really thought he had the coolest job in the world. He fixes people with his own hands. I knew med school would be harder than undergrad and it is but it's not as bad as I was afraid it would be. Like how the transition from high school to college was difficult but manageable if you worked harder, this is kind of the same relationship to undergrad. The part that's different is that I almost immediately fell into a great group of friends when I started college. I never felt like I didn't have people I could go to with stuff.\n\nIt's not that there's not stuff going on. My classmates are social and I really like most of them. I just feel like I haven't really connected with any of them in a meaningful way. It's really competitive and I just feel like everyone is waiting for everyone else to slip up. *It really hit me a few weeks ago on my birthday.* My parents called me and we chatted for awhile and eventually they asked me if I was doing anything with \"my friends\" to celebrate and it really hit me when I had to stop myself from telling them \"I don't have any friends.\" But I can't tell them that so I just said yeah. And I did invite a lot of my classmates to go grab drinks that night and some of them came. Probably most of the people I invited showed up and told me happy birthday and some even got me a card or a present or told me they were buying my drinks that night. I just kind of felt isolated. They all have their friend groups and hung out with their friend groups that night and I'm not really in any of them. I just felt like I was kind of there as a supporting cast member on my own birthday. I went home and cried and I don't even know why. I wasn't expecting anything different but it still hurt. I hate having to ask other people if I can hang out when their friends it just makes me feel pathetic. I just feel invisible right now and I can't do this. I'm stressed and tired all of the time but I can handle that. What I can't handle is being so alone. All of my friends from undergrad are out living life and making new friends and working and starting families or whatever and they all seem so happy. I almost called my best friend from college tonight but I just couldn't bring myself to do it. We've drifted apart and she's engaged and working at her dream job and just doing so much. And then I almost called my last ex from college but I couldn't do that either. I broke up with him last spring because he was fully prepared to come here with me and go to grad school in the same city and it hurt but I knew that he got into his dream grad school in another country and I couldn't be the reason he gave that opportunity up. We still text occasionally but I just can't dump all of this on him given that if I let him follow me here, I probably wouldn't be in this exact situation. I know he still cares about me and I do too but we just can't talk about stuff this deep anymore.\n\nAnd I can't tell my parents about any of this. I don't want them to worry or think I can't do this because I know I can and I want to. I still enjoy going to class and love what I'm learning but it just sucks. I know there are groups of my classmates studying together and I'm sitting at my kitchen table alone every day studying by myself because they don't invite me. And I know I'm not here to make friends but I'm a fairly social person. I don't do well alone. I thought maybe dating would help but everyone I met on tinder who wanted more than a hookup wanted more of my time than I can afford to give.\n\nI live in one of the biggest cities in the world and I feel completely alone. There was one guy I was pretty good friends with. He was my lab partner this fall and we got along really well. We hung out all the time - we'd get dinner together then go to my place and split a bottle of wine and study together almost every night. We got drinks together every Friday night. I told him things that I wouldn't tell just anyone. I thought we were best friends. Then on Christmas day he called me and told me he was really into me and how every night we spent studying together all he wanted to do was kiss me and just spilled his feelings. I didn't expect it at all and I didn't know what to say. I didn't feel the same so I told him that and said I really valued our friendship and cared about him but that was all it was going to be and that I hoped he understood. I told him I didn't want anything to change between us but he got kind of angry and hung up in the middle of a sentence from me and we're barely spoken since. I texted him a couple times after Christmas and asked if he wanted to meet up and talk about what happened but he never replied. He sits on the other side of classrooms from me and won't even look at me if I see him at the library. I think that's what hurts the most. The one person I thought I was close to turned out to have a completely different agenda that didn't involve being my friend.\n\nSo I just don't know what to do. My school offers counseling but I'm just not interested in going because I've tried seeing a therapist before and I just can't open up like I need to for it to be effective. And there's always the fear in the back of my head that anything I do now could potentially hurt my future career. I know all about HIPPA and confidentiality but I'm still afraid someone would find out if I was seeing a therapist or taking medication and it would ruin everything. Even though medicine is about helping sick people, there's a huge stigma about medical students and doctors needing help themselves.\n\nI feel like I have nobody in the world anymore and it's killing me. I don't know if I can do this for another year and a half at least.", "subreddit": "lonely"}

The things I'm feeling are things I haven't felt since I was a child. I never expected that they'd stir from the pit at this time in my life. I'm 26. I'm at University in my Third Year. I'm not a bad student. I have a few friends. I have my family. My life, I suppose you could say, is not that bad. Yet, this is how it looks to an outside observer, and I bury so many secrets beneath the surface that only I see.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow, these feelings. Let me describe them to you. I feel alone. I feel deeply sad. I feel protracted terror. My mind projects images of my future that feel painfully real. I'm in my death bed in a hospital. The nurses don't even know my name. My family are not there. Some of them will be dead. Others will have forgotten me. I will have no partner and no friends and I will die there in fear and pain with no one to hold my hand and tell me they care. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI could bear the weight of the world and any tragedy, if I only had a hand to hold and tell me 'it's ok'.

Truly, the most monstrous, painful screams, but they are silent. My mouth is wide and creased, the look in my eye is barely human, and yet, I cannot make a sound. I think a part of my soul is burning and screaming like this below the surface. Maybe I need to rescue that version of myself in order to get better? I'm not sure.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI feel as if I am back at school, where I was bullied, I felt ugly and disgusting, and I had nobody then. I used to walk with my lunchbox at break time on the boundaries of the grounds, away from all the other children. I was so ashamed of my weight, my manner, my impulsive anger and slow wit. I feel so much shame right now, from back then. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI am wise enough to know that the world will not stop turning despite these needles in my brain, but how they twist and jab and make me weep. I am old enough to know that my life is short and I should be using it for something important, yet I feel so stuck. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nCan I recover from this? Who will return from the depths?

You can fuck it up beyond repair. It is possible to be born into a family who doesn\u2019t love you. It is possible to lose all of your friends, or to never have had a genuine relationship in your entire life. But you\u2019ll be hard-pressed to find anyone who will admit that.\n\nYou might think that\u2019s a good thing. People wanting to stay positive couldn\u2019t be bad, right? But the problem with that line of reasoning is this\u2014no one will ever be honest and tell you that your life is not worth living. No matter how much you fuck it up, no matter how many dead ends you reach on the road to happiness, no one will ever admit that your life is broken beyond repair.\n\nThis is partially because humans are instinctually programmed to want to survive, and to avoid fail states. It directly opposes survival to not have hope when you find yourself in a bad situation. \n\nFor example, if you fell down a hole, and your first thought was \u201cI fell down this hole. There is no way out. I am going to die down here.\u201d you would be less inclined to try any escape methods since you had already come to terms with your fate. On the other hand, if you\u2019re first thought was, \u201cI fell down this hole. I need to get the fuck out of here!!\u201d you would try multiple escape tactics. You\u2019d scream for help, scrape your fingernails on the dirt trying to claw your way up, try digging a tunnel, etc.\n\nThe point is, you would at least have a chance to escape. Or more importantly, you would **think** you did. There is also a chance that a person who yells, screams, digs, and claws at the dirt will not survive anyway. But that\u2019s not very pleasant to think about, is it?\n\nThere are many people who have fallen down this hypothetical hole, and can\u2019t get out. Those who have gotten out of their \u201chole\u201d will always encourage you to keep trying. No matter how deep your hole looks, and no matter how unlikely it seems that you will escape, they will always give you the same answer\u2014*keep* *trying*. \n\nThis phrase haunts those of us who have tried, and have rarely seen success. This phrase tortures us, and keeps us tied to a planet we never asked to be on. I don\u2019t know about you guys, but I\u2019m tired of trying and failing over and over again.

In this post: [https://www.reddit.com/r/ForeverAlone/comments/ab5n1z/welp\\_im\\_gonna\\_do\\_it/](https://www.reddit.com/r/ForeverAlone/comments/ab5n1z/welp_im_gonna_do_it/), I committed to said exercise, in addition to outlining some parameters. Because few bars are open, and few people attend bars, on weekdays, however, I have since amended the exercise; now aiming to speak to three women on Fridays, three on Saturdays and three on Sundays, for the four weekends of January, for a total of 36. The following post comprises my eleventh such account, my account of the night of 03/02/2019.\n\nFortunately, it was cooler tonight than last night, so I was able to go out this time. Tonight, it was the bowling alley again. Spoke to two women (a pair of friends). Approaching and initiating a conversation with a group of women, while admittedly something that most men find even more intimidating than approaching and initiating a conversation with a single woman, is a good thing to force yourself to do, as it builds both confidence and conversational skills. However, I did not ask for the number of either of them, as one already had a boyfriend and the other was leaving the country soon. Also, I am not quite sure how one would go about asking for the number of a woman who was part of a group. Somehow, asking for one woman's number but none of the other's, and asking for the number of several or all of the women in the group, both don't come off as quite right to me.\n\nLater, a third woman \u2013 get this \u2013 *came and spoke to me!* Why, though, I do not know, for she, too, already had a boyfriend. Just in case anybody is wondering, no, I do not believe that a woman has ever lied to me about already having a boyfriend in order to dissuade me. I have never talked to a woman about anything other than the banal stuff one is pretty much expected to talk about at these Meetups, not making any overt romantic gestures until asking for their number at the end. My guess is that this third woman simply wanted to speak neutrally to me.\n\nBy now, I have more or less fallen into a predictable routine. I attend a Meetup each Friday, Saturday and Sunday unless \\[A\\]; it is too hot, or \\[B\\]; there is something else I want or need to do that night. (And yes, this does tend to happen at least once a week.) I approach as many women as I can find an opening with. I talk to them about banal shit for 15 \u2013 30 minutes. If I build up enough rapport with them, I ask for their number. If I receive it, I try ringing and/or texting them. It isn't hard, but nor is it particularly lucrative. Unless I can think of something (or unless someone can suggest something) else, I suspect that this is more or less the routine I will adhere to for the remainder of the exercise.\n\nWell, at least I actually met my quota tonight. Also, at 19, I'm officially past the halfway mark.\n\nAlso, tomorrow I'm gonna try ringing that woman whose number I got on Friday.\n\n**Tally:**\n\nGoal: 36.\n\nPoints: 19.\n\nBrownie points: 4.\n\nRejections: 0.\n\nPhone numbers: 3.\n\nDates: 1.\n\nAgain; ***polite***, ***constructive***, ***good faith*** suggestions are appreciated.", "subreddit": "ForeverAlone"}

She likes anime/superhero shows, invited me to ComicCon, had awesome goals, and I could tell she really cares about her family. I thought she was the one for me although we haven't met in IRL yet. I've asked her if she wanted to get ice cream after we're done with our exams (so after two weeks) and she agreed. I couldn't describe how happy and secured I've felt about myself since I'm 20 years old and never had a first date/kiss. The fact that I've found a girl who is interested in me as I am in her was incredible.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBut then, a few days before our date, she told me how she was interested in another guy and \"felt unfair\" that she liked both of us. She asked me if I wanted to stay as friends and I agreed since I couldn't do anything about it. However, I wasn't sure if the date was happening or not. So on the next day I've asked her for clarification and she responded with \"No sorry, I really have feelings for this other guy\".

I was prepared and I did everything he suggested-- bring cologne, gum, and chapstick to stay fresh and nice; learn to dance and be interactive with people; approach any girl who interests me who appears to be sitting alone, etc. Since the gala was semi-formal, I got to experiment with my clothes; rolled up the sleeves of my suit jacket, wore a plain-white long sleeve T-shirt, black slackers with black Sketchers sneaker. I'm sure I looked decent that night.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLast minute, however, my friend decided not to go. He heard it was going to be too cold. I decided to go anyways, even if it was. I didn't even bring a coat; it wasn't going to go well with my outfit anyways. On the night of the gala (which, since it was indoors, was actually quite warm), I froze up. Forgot just about everything my friend told me, and I had to resort to texting to him on the phone for just a little bit of solace. The live music was so loud that I could barely hear myself, making it impossible for me (who is already hard of hearing) to interact with anyone in the room. My friend suggested to me to look for anyone outside of the room to grab food or take a break from the music. I looked all around me and everybody seemed to be with somebody. I was the only one alone, or so I thought.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI mean, there was this one girl who had to approach me (which I feel gravely sorry for) because she saw that I was dancing (well more like nodding) alone. I made up an excuse saying that I was just \"enjoying the atmosphere\", but we sparked up a great conversation. We talked about what we'll do after high school and our careers, so on so forth. I wasn't planning to go to college-- rather a racing school instead.

I, probably like most of us on r/lonely, will be spending my Valentine's Day alone. My ex will probably be spending it with her ex that she dumped me for... But who knows. Maybe they aren't even together anymore. Maybe she'll be alone too. I don't know. I just know she doesn't care about me. It's been 23 days since I last heard from her. How can someone dump somebody for someone else? Sleep with someone else when the bed is still warm from your relationship? What happened to faithfulness? How can someone be alright with them self knowing they emotionally destroyed someone else? Knowing that they fucked with their emotions and their life?\n\nAnyways back to the point of this world being cold. Last week one of my coworkers texted me making fun of me since I was going to be alone on Valentine's Day. It was very mean and heartless but a lot of my coworkers are like that. Why do people enjoy hurting other people? Does it make them feel better about themselves?? It seems like I've seen a lot of two things on Reddit lately. Cheaters. And suicide. Now I can very much relate to being cheated on and it disgusts me that so many other people are experiencing situations so similar to mine. Why are there so many cheaters? So many people that don't value relationships and don't value their partner or there feelings. Now on to the subject of suicide. It seems like that subject has been showing up a lot on this subreddit. We had a case the other day were the OP was going to end it that night. Despite the vast majority of us offering our support and trying to save a life.... There was a handful of people that encouraged the OP to do it? That is seriously so messed up. What is wrong with people? Everyone's life is valuable and worth living. We never did hear back or get a update from the OP and it has really bothered me..\n\nI don't know. I'm starting to lose my faith in humanity and this world. It seems like there's so many bad people in this world. It seems like the good people always finish last, get taken advantage of, and walked all over. It seems like nothing we do makes any difference. Please convince me I'm wrong.

I initially was hesitant to post it on my actual account, but now I am like fuck it, who is going to care or read it outside this sub, let alone know who I am in RL\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n \n\nAs  many people in this sub have the misconception that females cant be the  FA.. here I am, a 30 year old lifer FA.. I was never a normie, never  had a chance to be one.. please read to the end\n\nI  hail from a country in South Asia \\[being intentionally vague here\\] with  narcissist mother and dad who just turned a blind eye to everything. In  school I was bullied, so I spent my entire school career either in the  library or in the classroom. At home, home life was no better. Mom was  abusive \\[emotionally and mentally\\] and narcassistic. I was the cause of  everything that is wrong in the universe. I was ugly and fat and had  questionable hygiene, according to her She is miserable. She used to say  how she is only with me for the society - that I will get stigma if she  leaves.. that world will say \"first dad left her, now mother left her\".  Always threatened to disown me over every little thing, always  threatened to disown me. Once I snapped and said, if you keep saying you  will leave, why dont you.. and apparently I am a bitch to say that. Mom  treated myself and her as one unit, as opposed to me being my own  person and having my own needs and thought ptocess. I was just told how  all my ideas and thoughts are wrong. I was expected to act as if her  friends are my friends and be joined to her at the hip, both literally  and figuratively. Once she said to me, I tried so hard to make you just  like me, but you were stubborn and refused. My hair was a source of  dispute too because she wanted my hairdo to be like hers, which was  impossible because of different hair types and textures, but boy did she  try Thanks to that, I till today get very agitated if anyone touches my  hair\n\nI  got into undergrad, and I was like, finally, yay finally friends. Or so  I thought. I joined a friends group, or so I thought. I thought we were  friends, but allegedly we were not. They were red flags, like  exclusions sometimes, and I noticed that while they all texted each  other over the weekend, my phone never buzzed over the weekend. I  brushed aside these red flags thinking that maybe I am expecting too  much. Friend group coincidentally happened to be all female, and all of  them had men interested in them, except me of course. I was invisible  while they all had men interested in them. Not going to lie, It was a  huge blow to the self esteem, but I made sure it didnt show. But my so  called friends started looking down on me because of that. At the end,  their attitude towards me became, \"lets exclud her so much that she  leaves the group on her own\". which meant the friendships fizzled out.  In hindight I saw that while they were all friends with each other, I  was just someone who hung out with the group.\n\nI  moved to the US in 2013 and have been here ever since. Did a Master and  if all goes well, will finish my Doctorate in May 2020. I thought my  coming to the US and I will make friends here will be my last chance at  friendship and it will happen. I thought, maybe I was bullied in school,  I did make friends in uni even though it didnt work out. But alas, I  was mistaken. Didnt make a signle friend. Just some people at work I  pass by in the corridoor and say hello to in passing. That is it. As you  get older, you not only shed friends, it harder to make them too. So I  guess I am officially an FA. I didnt want to accept it until  I found  this sub and found my people.\n\nNever,  in my 30 years on earth, have I ever picked up the phone and called  someone to just talk. There has never been anyone to just talk to. Never  in my 30 years on earth did I recieve a text message from anyone to  check on me, there is nobody to send me a text. In my 30 years on this  earth, it has always been just me, whenther I ran away from abuse or  narcassim or bad situations, it was always just me. Never anyone to even  just talk things to when I had a bad day.\n\nTo  my mom, I am a volunarity FA \\[even though I doubt she has even heard  this term\\]. She says I dont tak to people \\[and cant talk to people too,  according to her\\]. I tell her I dont socialize because I dont want to.  If anyone asks me in front of my mom if I like any man or if any man is  interested in me, instead of allowing me to just decline and move on, my  mom, as a way to put me down, further, speaks up, \"oh she is not the  type to have a crush on anyone\". It pisses me off when she says that but  I dont confront her because I know how that will go, she will demand  evidence of my man and as I obviously have none to provide, it will  reinforce it to her that \"she is not the type to have a crush on  anyone\". Accordng to my mom, I am on purpose not getting a man to spite  her. People applaud me for my work ethic, \"being narrow and focused\",  working my ass off, working hard, being dedicated, etc etc. But its not  that simple. I am an FA focused on a career and hard working, because I  have nothing else in my life. I'd rather have less career attainment and  be a non-FA. Behind the scenes, I am crumbling. I am very depressed, I  have never been happy. I feel like worthless garbage. Every single day,  at least once a day, without fail, I have one long good cry. I would  love to have a lover or a FWB or a casual BF or whatever, my only  requirement is that I feel comfortable with him and he be willing to  accept me for what I am, beyond that I will take what I can get. Still  nothing. Online dating meant 100 percent without fail ghosting. Meetup  and clubs are garbage, so dont suggest that. Dont tell me parties  because I have no way of going to one or have any way of knowing about  one.\n\nMy  mom used to say to me, \"we need other people, other people dont need  us\". As a kid, I did used to think, someone who already has friends, and  has a vibrant social cricle, donesnt need little old me. Only if  someone doesnt have anyone would they potentially have a need for little  old me. But as I get older, I think that is true, I need others, nobody  needs me. So I drag on some super dead online friendships which only  exist because I keep pumping in life to them with people who wont notice  it even if I dropped dead today.\n\nAnd  to add to it, I remain hopelessly in love with someone I met online who  most likely just played me for fun and games and laughs. I know he has a  vibrant social circle both online and offline, so no need for little  old me. I think only way I could possibly move on from him is if there  were someone else to replace him with in my mind, even if its a FWB. But  no chance of that happening. We still interact from time ot time as we  frequent similar chat rooms, and it pulls my heart strings even now.\n\nTL;DR..  The reason why I am an FA is due to circumstance and opportunity. FA  are not such out of choice or defect of their own, because some of the  nicest people are FA and some literal garbage people are normies. It is  pure circumstance and opportunity. I am going to die as a kiss less hug  less virgin because nobody wants to bang me.", "subreddit": "ForeverAlone"}

At the time, it was the biggest news story in America and had captured the world's attention. How could this one random \"Filipino boytoy\" be so adept at evading the **FBI** for so long? The reason we don't hear much about it now is because just a month after Cunanan shot himself in a beach house in Miami, Princess Diana died and that was *much bigger news* when compared to Cunanan.\n\nHis problem was that he was coaxed by his father and his peers into believing he was something he wasnt. Cunanan wanted to be *special.* He was told was by numerous people and spent his life trying to gain attention and affection from others. Something he had great difficulty doing. And this want for love and the lack of it led him to snap one day, when he killed two previous boyfriends and started on his path of destruction.\n\n&gt;Apr\u00e8s moi, d\u00e9luge.\n\nApparently, many things, from the odd tactic of making friends (which has greatly failed me), to his desire for affection, to his strange demeanor and \"unstable mind\" are things people have said resemble me. Someone once even told me I'd \"grow up to be Ted Bundy, minus the looks and charm.\"\n\nSo, according to my peers, I remind them of **more than one prolific serial killer.** And they wonder why I never talk to any of them.", "subreddit": "ForeverAlone"}

They're not there to scare you. They're there to let you know that something is worth it\u201d**  \n\nI sometimes catch a train from my gym to the city centre and there's often a half hour wait on a tiny platform. With nothing to do except stare at a wall or dick around on my phone, I usually start a conversation someone who is also waiting at the station (men and old women only; I never approach women here for obvious reasons) and talk about whatever until the train pulls up.  \n\nA year ago I met a guy who shares some of my interests and we got along quite well, so we'd say hi to each other whenever we happened to be there on the same day.   \n\nNow, this guy is pretty handsome, tall and dresses well. When he spots a beautiful woman walking along the platform, he'll often watch her as he's talking to me, turning his head and admiring them from the top of the stairs until they've passed directly in front of us. He does this openly and with an appreciative, non-threatening smile on his face...   \n\n...and women seem to love it. It flies in the face of everything that feminists have told me, everything I was taught as a child about respecting women. The majority of these women smile back at him with a hint of excitement in their eyes, some will start swaying their hips and look back to see if he's watching, I've even had to sit through a few of them ignoring me while starting a conversation with him.  \n\nSo I started wondering if perhaps he was displaying his attraction in a way that isn't problematic.  \nAfter all: he's physically lower than the women he admires, he's not close enough to touch them, he's engaged in a normal conversation with me so they know he isn't drunk, he's dressed in sharp business attire so the women must be aware he's not loitering at the station, plus he's not demanding her time. Altogether this says *I'm enjoying the view but I respect your time and I won't do anything that makes you feel uncomfortable. The ball is in your court and however you react is fine with me, no big deal*.  \n\nI wondered if I could do the same thing - perhaps it isn't misogynistic after all to appreciate a woman's beauty. Women are just people and, well... people like to feel validated when nothing is being demanded in exchange. It's a nice feeling.  \n\nI took my nicest casual outfit in my gym bag the next day. I freshened up in the shower after my workout, did power poses in the shower stall to boost my confidence and improve my posture, and listened to a bit of an interesting, upbeat podcast while I walked to the station. I feel optimistic after a workout and I wanted a positive, relaxed mindset so that my body language wouldn't make these women uncomfortable.  \n\nWhen I arrived, I sat down on a bench and took a look at a few women who were standing nearby.  \nInstead of flicking my eyes away when they saw me, I widened my smile a little and nodded to acknowledge them. They gave me polite smiles which didn't reach their eyes and walked further along the platform.  \n\n\\&gt;**No big deal**  \n\nA woman around my age came down the stairs after a few more minutes and I committed to the experiment. I looked her up and down with a smile on my face, making sure not to leer and also not stare at her breasts. When she saw me, her body stiffened with discomfort/fear and she bolted her vision to something in the distance until she had passed me.  \n\n\\&gt;**Uh, okay. Perhaps she'd just had a bad day?**  \n\nI repeated this same process with each new woman until my train arrived a quarter hour later.   \n\nI did exactly what I'd seen this other guy doing and instead of positive, flirty interactions, literally every woman looked uncomfortable with what I was doing. I got nothing more than icy grimaces which said 'please do not speak to me'.  \n\nI felt crushed. \n", "subreddit": "ForeverAlone"}

Anhedonia is a condition where there is an inability to feel positive emotions.  It's usually a transient symptom of things like depression, or addicts in early recovery.  But for me, it seems permanent.\n\nI do not remember the last time I was both happy and sober.  I haven't drank in \\~650 days, and even my counselor admits my continuing problems with flat emotional response is rather baffling, as they usually expect to see improvement on the emotional front from addicts who have a year sober (it usually only takes a few months).  I even have a blunted response to many *negative* emotions as well, and although this can have some benefits on occasion (stress tolerance), I still struggle with the big ones every day...things like loneliness, despair, etc.\n\nSo what's one of the most important aspects of any good relationship?  An emotional connection.  I can't really make those anymore.  It's probably a combination of my rough childhood, severe alcoholism, near-death experience, mental disorder(s), zero intimate experiences, and all sorts of things combined that've resulted in a brain that has almost entirely killed emotion.  Not exactly what you'd call a \"good catch.\"\n\nIn my research, I haven't found any indication there's something that can be done about this.  Therapy seems centered around helping individuals who have problems with identifying/regulating/coping/etc. with emotions.  Nothing about helping people who just don't experience them anymore in the first place.  I suppose you'd want to treat the cause of anhedonia, which in my case is probably depression, but I've had some response to medication/other treatments that've significantly helped in most areas, but not with anhedonia.\n\nSo I'm probably screwed.  I think a better therapeutic approach would be coming to terms with accepting the way I am, and not beating myself up over it.  Though, at this point, I do question the point of life.  If all I experience is distress, and nothing positive to balance it out, what's the point?  I don't particularly enjoy living; I don't get too sad about it anymore, I just think after 32 years of this crap, enough is enough, you know?  ", "subreddit": "ForeverAlone"}

I don't have many friends at all, to where I would have considered him 1 of only 2 people I really would have consider \"friend\" more than \"awkward acquaintance\" who I never talk to unless specific events happen. This was kind of a straw that broke a camel's back situation, which is why I don't quite why I feel a mix of upset and a neutral of \"alright, that happened, on to the next thing\"\n\nSo, I've known this person for 4 years and we became friends probably about 2 years ago. He was always a bit of an eccentric character, but so am I in a sense, so who am I to judge. This was part of the final straw though. When messaging him, no matter what the subject, serious or not. He would completely change the subject, would lead with things that sound serious in the context of the sentence before, and just go completely off the deep end, saying things that are frankly nonsensical that, would change the subject entirely. It was very frustrating to me, someone who doesn't ever have serious conversations with people like some were, yet wants them with someone I actually know. This is where I kind of snapped a little and told him to \"talk to me again when he can stop with that bullshit\". A bit impulsive, but the frustration had gotten to me at that point.\n\nThe other thing that bothered me a lot more but I was going to just let go without making a fuss was something he said this past December. He said (I'm paraphrasing. I didnt write down what he said exactly, but it was to this effect), \"people like us don't need to have a bunch of friends\" with absolutely zero social awareness of the complete differing situations we are in. He has friends he talks to all the time, hangs out with, chats with, and whatever all the time. I had(have, I guess, I really don't know) two friends. I haven't been invited over to a friend's place in at least a decade. I don't hang out with people ever unless it's something where people are forced to be around me. It's not uncommon for me to go weeks during breaks and the summer without someone so much as saying hi. He knows that I have struggled on and off with the thought that I will die of old age alone in every possible way. A seemingly ridiculous conclusion that I have thought since probably around late elementary school. (yeah, I realize it likely teenage angst or whatever. That doesn't help the circumstances of my life are currently playing out to be exactly like that) I was even in kind of an upswing at that moment, and was feeling optimistic about what could be for the first time in a bit. Now I'm seeing it play out like I have hoped so desperately my life wouldn't. My relationships with my friends being slowly worn away, and being left with nothing.\n\nI wish I could do more to prevent this, I really do. It's been a struggle just to get what little I have in the friends department. With a mix of some bad social anxiety, and depression, to go along with the typical teenage self image of terriblsness. It makes it hard to even say hello to people sometimes. I know I'm not perfect to go along with this. I'm anal retentive, I have a dislike of touching people for the most part. It makes it difficult to really do anything without being explicitly invited or required to go, which is why having the few friends I had was such a godsend as it was, and why I gave him so many chances and mild requests to stop with it for me to get irritated about it.\n\nWhen I'm around people, I like to think I'm respectful and helpful where applicable, and I try to put on a mask of confidence, in theory helping to build confidence, and I think it's going somewhere, but then I get a moment like this where it all falls apart, I feel like I'm back at square one, and I'm just venting away nonsensically into the internet.

His story about his life really hit close to him for me. He shows why he's ugly from his teeth, to his jaw, to his skin. I really liked his honesty and that he didn't try to say how nobody is ugly. I felt bad that he had all of those bad experiences mostly just from his looks. His personality seems okay but obviously he's depressed from a childhood of being bullied to him struggling to talk to women as an adult.\n\nThe comments on his video really say a lot about how while people will ask you to send your picture to them and how they will be brutally honest, most people don't have the nerve to tell someone who is unattractive that they are unattractive. They will cover it in meme advice. Lets see some of the top comments.\n\n\"Are you willing to admit this is all a mental health issue you are suffering with\"\n\n\"You don't even look that bad, man.\ufeff\"\n\n\"That being said, you are not an unattractive person in the slightest. Your teeth are not even too bad, in fact the person I was the most in love with had not too great of teeth but I found it quite charming. Please try to criticize yourself less because it makes your confidence hit incredibly low levels and honestly confidence is the number 1 biggest trait people look for. Keep your head up, it will get better. Maybe try a new haircut that covers your forehead more if that is an insecurity of yours, start working out, force yourself into social situations because looks are not everything.\"\n\n\"You have kind eyes, full lips and beautiful even skin tone. The most beautiful people in the world are the kind ones happily marching to their own beat and being themselves without apology. Be yourself and own it. Not every girl wants an Alpha Male, mate :) they want conversation, friendship first, common interests and someone who makes them happy. PS: the relationship you mentioned was not a healthy one. A lot of people have been in abusive relationships like this. Even the biggest Alpha Male. I think you need to heal after being with that awful person and get good with who you are. Some people get off on power.. and gentle people are their target. We have beacons on our head for them to see us... But once you heal, you will not be fooled by the same wolf twice :) you will become more confident in yourself. If someone makes you feel like that remember they are beneath you. Nothing but spiritual and emotional vampires. Don't feed them, brother. Look after yourself. Find something you're passionate about.. you will find the right person while you're doing what you love.\ufeff\"\n\n\"You aren't ugly bro. Hit the gym. Maybe style your hair. You can look good just need the confidence\ufeff.\"\n\n\"Right, let's say that 99% of people found you \"unattractive\" that still means that over 7,200,000 find you attractive. You just gotta keep on searching bro!\ufeff\"\n\n\"This is going to be hard to hear and disappointing, but you are not ugly.\"\n\n\"Dont go on dating apps, wash everyday, get braces for your teeth, buy fashionable well fitting clothes, dont wear that hat. Start going out and talking to people and girls in person, after a year you will get confident and good at speaking/socialising.\ufeff\"\n\nSome people were honest but most of the top comments were denying that he is unattractive and giving meme advice. This is why there is no point in posting pictures on those rateme subs. You could be a 1 and most people would say, you are not ugly but you should get a haircut and dress better.

In this post: [https://www.reddit.com/r/ForeverAlone/comments/ab5n1z/welp\\_im\\_gonna\\_do\\_it/](https://www.reddit.com/r/ForeverAlone/comments/ab5n1z/welp_im_gonna_do_it/), I committed to said exercise, in addition to outlining some parameters. Because few bars are open, and few people attend bars, on weekdays, however, I have since amended the exercise; now aiming to speak to three women on Fridays, three on Saturdays and three on Sundays, for the four weekends of January, for a total of 36. The following post is not an account, but rather is to let you know that I called the woman whose number I got on Friday, and that although the conversation was very drawn out \u2013 with it taking her so long to reply each time that I kept assuming she must have gone ghost on me \u2013 she eventually agreed to go out with me. We\u2019re grabbing lunch and a movie tomorrow. (It\u2019s a weekday, but I\u2019m currently unemployed and she works weekends).\n\nWell, how\u2019s this for a beginner? Only a little over one month into this exercise, without me even having gone out every Friday, Saturday and Sunday and without me even having spoken to three women each time, and I\u2019ve already landed two dates with two different women. And here I thought I was never even going to land one, and some of you were advising me to not even attempt this exercise at all. What a pleasant surprise, and what a good thing I decided to attempt it after all.\n\nIn case anyone accuses me of doing so, no; I am not boasting by virtue of reporting this. To boast would be to brag about how skilled I was. I openly admit that I do not, in fact, possess any skills beyond basic social functionality. What I am doing, instead, is emphasizing that something which I thought would be difficult is not, in fact, that difficult; that something which I thought would require rarefied skills does not, in fact, really require any skills at all. In doing so, I hope to encourage others. If you, yourself, possess basic social functionality, then you, too, ought to be capable of doing what I have done, and ought to at least try to do so. I am not saying: \u201cBwahaha, look at me, I\u2019ve already scored two chicks, you losers\u201d, but rather: \u201cI\u2019m just an ordinary guy like you, and I thought that I wouldn\u2019t be able to get a date, but I tried, and I did, and it wasn\u2019t that hard, so maybe you/me were wrong about this, and you should try too.\u201d\n\nI\u2019ll tell you about the date tomorrow night.\n\n**Tally:**\n\nGoal: 36.\n\nPoints: 19.\n\nBrownie points: 4.\n\nRejections: 0.\n\nPhone numbers: 3.\n\nDates: 2.\n\nAgain; ***polite***, ***constructive***, ***good faith*** suggestions are appreciated.", "subreddit": "ForeverAlone"}

Haven\u2019t posted in awhile. Just something crossing my mind at the moment. And it\u2019s just a perspective based off of observations, not necessarily facts...I just find myself having trouble communicating with my friends when I\u2019m lonely and they don\u2019t get it.\n\nAs I browse reddit dating subs and get to know to people in person, I always come across the same dilemma. There are SO MANY people (men AND women) who share their desire to want a relationship/sex/love and how hard it is to not have it, yet there are just as many people insistent on the fact that those things aren\u2019t important and you can be happy without. Comments such as \u201clove yourself first\u201d or to be the best version of yourself before finding someone. \n\nNow obviously there are people that exist for which that is true, they don\u2019t need love OR physical intimacy to be happy. But that number is so small. So why does the general population, despite all the \u201ccongratulations\u201d on new Facebook engagements and sympathies during breakups, still think that it\u2019s reasonable to say the lonely need to stay alone? That they \u201cneed/should\u201d be alone and not date until they\u2019re \u201cready\u201d. (Also, \u201cready\u201d doesn\u2019t happen for everybody). That it\u2019s oh so wrong to admit even an ounce of desire to be with another human being. \n\nI get that nobody wants to date someone who feels like a downer or can\u2019t support them emotionally. That\u2019s okay- not all people are capable of handling dating someone with mental health issues as well. \n\nBut honestly....how many people actually follow their own advice? Who was ever \u201cready\u201d for each person they ended up if they\u2019ve dated people since high school? None of them. They learn through experience and deal with heartbreak, and some choose to be alone to heal, but they are more likely to find someone again. I can think of at least 5 people who were FA for a long duration of time, until somehow they found one person to have a relationship with, broke up, and continued to have other prospects, including casual sex. \n\nAlso, I always see posts of my coupled friends gushing over how much they love their SO who helped them through x y z struggles or accomplishments, such as weight loss, career advancements, beating cancer, etc. I wonder how different they would have turned out if the SO wasn\u2019t actually there. Most of the time I don\u2019t mind these posts as long as they are not spouting the hypocritical advice I stated earlier. I have accomplished every single thing by myself in life, and went through my struggles by myself (friends and family helped as they could verbally, but it\u2019s nothing compared to the oxytocin release from kisses, hugs and crying into someone arms). I can only imagine how much more I could\u2019ve accomplished had I had the proper emotional support, constant reassurance, and no deprivation of intimacy and oxytocin.\n\nI just wish for once, when I talk to \u201cnormal\u201d people who have always had sex/love, that they would take a moment of pause and ask themselves, \u201cwould I have ended up with the same loneliness and depression if I also went forever without reciprocation and touching?\u201d\nBut that never happens. The only person who has ever said that is my best friend - who is in her third long term relationship that is heading toward marriage, and after seeing me struggle with being alone for 10+ years (we met in high school).\n\n\nOn another note....\nI have also experienced something very interesting the last few months. \n1) I\u2019ve been working on finding employment (got laid off) and since my mind isn\u2019t on guys as much, I\u2019ve noticed some guys flirting with me out of nowhere (most of which are in a sport league I play). I even felt one guy massaging my back when he said goodbye around our group table. \n2) if I\u2019m talking to one specific guy, the other guys notice and start talking to me or staring at me if that guy walks away (I.e. using restroom). \n\n[Edit: I should note this is when I\u2019m all sweaty and gross after the games, not even trying to look hot! ]\n\nI feel like I was experiencing two phenomenons - the \u201cit happens when you\u2019re not looking\u201d shit and a perceived marketability by being in proximity to other guys (and the guy is giving off a vibe that he is attracted to me). \n\nThese sorts of things seem really basic but I swear there is a significant difference compared to my normal interactions with men. I can\u2019t tell you what I did or didn\u2019t do to attract them, but for the first time in a LONG time I felt like things weren\u2019t completely hopeless. Obviously these guys are my friends from the league, so I\u2019m gonna go with the flow for the weeknight I attend that way there\u2019s no pressure in having to pursue someone specific and get heartbroken.

I'll put a TL;DR at the end to summarize.\n\nA kind of long while back, I had a bittersweet dream of a girl at a campfire. Basically, we looked at one another and felt the same way, she jumped into my arms and we kissed. We knew we may never see each other again either because we knew this was a dream or we were just parting ways. It stayed in my memory because of how satisfying and how good it felt, then how bittersweet it was following. The girl in this dream related to no one that I knew in real life.\n\nI had another dream last night where I got somewhat of a similar feeling. I saw a girl that I've known since childhood. Before I talk about the 2nd dream, I'm gonna give backstory on this girl.\n\nWe have a long history, basically an unofficial long distance relationship for many years before she started liking other guys while I still loved her, and proceeded to help her through many bad relationships, being that guy. 10 years after we met, I was in highschool and decided to finally tell her how I felt and got denied. I shut down at first, but after a few years I was over her until I felt mature enough to talk to her again and be friends. We spent so much of our childhood together that we're surprisingly similar, but as with her most recent relationship, she cut me off because her boyfriend didn't want her talking to other guys that he didn't know, even tho I was willing to meet him too. At that point I decided that was an immature and messed up thing to do to a friend, and I won't forgive her unless she apologized. Haven't talked to her in probably about a year now.\n\nSo, onto the dream last night, I found her. We immediately hugged and it felt amazing, like I finally found someone who cares about me again enough to give me a real, loving hug. But then I remember she commented something stressing that it was as a friend, which I was okay with in the dream since I at least had someone who I felt close to again, but still a little disappointed. We then moved on to whatever we were up to next together, and I woke up or don't remember anymore.\n\nIt's not that I still want to be with her. I'm pretty sure I am over her. But i'm only 24 years old and crushing on her took up so much of my life. Because of that experience, I never actually engaged in any experiences relating to a real relationship. I've never had a real relationship. I can't imagine myself having a relationship with anyone because I don't know anyone.\n\nIdk what this really accomplishes. I guess I'm just venting, telling a story and reflecting on it a bit. Comment what you'd like and I'll reply as soon as I can. Might fall asleep soon though, in which case I'll reply early in the morning.\n\nTL;DR: I had a dream where I met a childhood friend (that threw me away as a friend irl) and we hugged. It felt nice. Woke up and wondered why I'd even think about her anymore. Pretty sure I just couldn't imagine any other person.", "subreddit": "lonely"}

The interviewer showed me an impressive schedule of events, containing one on nearly every day. You pay a monthly fee and you can attend as many events as you want. I was honest with him about my dating troubles being my reasons for joining. He said I'd be a good fit, but then came the problem of fees.\n\nThis club was expensive. I won't give you the exact number, but it was between $1,000 and $10,000 per year. I told him the cost was why I was hesitant, and he amped up the pressure by saying that this club valued commitment and if I didn't decide right then and there, they wouldn't give me another chance to enter.\n\nI did what any mature, independent adult would do and telephoned my parents for help.\n\nMy mother counseled me almost towards saying yes. I had one more question for him: did I have to pay any more at the events, or did my membership dues cover it? When it turned out that I had to pay entry fees on top of that, I gave up and said no.\n\nThe interviewer had said to me \"You're overanalyzing this, you're the only one in your way of a dating life\" and I had agreed with him. But while I waited for the elevator afterwards, a stark thought occurred to me:\n\n*Would you rather be a poor man in love, or a rich man alone?*\n\nI phoned my parents again in the lobby and told them as much, thinking of going back and begging for forgiveness. But they had wisely looked up the place on Yelp. It has quite a few 1-star reviews from people complaining about their predatory sales tactics and asserting that the events aren't nearly as fun as they seem.\n\nI made the right choice here. I hope I can find something similar, cheaper, and more legitimate.", "subreddit": "ForeverAlone"}

The perfect opportunity to finally get to talk to them.\n\nUnfortunatel, I just couldn't do it. I was too nervous and I couldn't think of a thing to say. But surprisintly, they all voluntarily said some full sentences to me. That cheered me up a little at first, but when I got home and started playing Kingdom Hearts 3 with no one to share the experience with, I remembered that they were only tolerating me because I was sitting in their vicinity at lunch and they weren't actually happy that I was there. It made me sad again and I sat through evening services completely dejected and watched the people who briefly talked to me legitimately enjoy my parents' company.\n\nToday I played some more KH3 while thinking of the family that acknowledged me, and when the game did one of its trademark speeches about friendship, I just broke down and cried while playing the game. Eventually I turned it off because it was dinnertime, but instead I continued to sit there in silence for about an hour, crying.\n\nIt's not the first time I've cried because a piece of media reminded me of something I can't have.

In this post: [https://www.reddit.com/r/ForeverAlone/comments/ab5n1z/welp\\_im\\_gonna\\_do\\_it/](https://www.reddit.com/r/ForeverAlone/comments/ab5n1z/welp_im_gonna_do_it/), I committed to said exercise, in addition to outlining some parameters. Because few bars are open, and few people attend bars, on weekdays, however, I have since amended the exercise; now aiming to speak to three women on Fridays, three on Saturdays and three on Sundays, for the four weekends of January, for a total of 36. The following post is not an account of a night spent doing such, but rather an account of a date I managed to secure.\n\nSo in case you didn\u2019t read yesterday\u2019s post; on said day, I texted a woman whose number I got on Friday, asked her if she\u2019d liked to go out the next day, and received a response in the affirmative. (The next day was a weekday, but I\u2019m currently unemployed and she works weekends). We ate lunch, during which we chatted pretty amiably, then loitered around the mall for about an hour to kill time, during which we chatted pretty amiably some more, then saw a movie, then parted ways for home. I felt much more of a \u201cvibe\u201d this time than I did on either of the previous two dates I\u2019ve been on \u2013 I found her a lot more attractive, the banter between the two of us was a lot more fluid, and the two of us laughed a lot more. Plus, afterwards, she explicitly told me that she\u2019d had a good time. Plus, when I asked her if she\u2019d like to go out again, she said yes. Plus, when I kissed her goodbye on the hand, she did not pull away. Dare I say, I believe I might just have gotten somewhere, chums. Enough for me to tag this as a success story.\n\nGonna text her again next Monday.\n\nRegarding how this effects the exercise \u2013 I am going to keep going out on Fridays and Sundays, and keep talking to as many women as I can each time. However, I am not going to ask for their numbers when I do. I wouldn\u2019t feel comfortable trying to arrange dates with other women when I was already dating one. And while I am aware that one does not necessarily *have* to arrange dates with the women whose numbers one obtains, it would seem somewhat pointless to obtain them if one didn\u2019t. Even if I were to cease dating the current woman, I suspect that the owners of any numbers I had in my backlog would have forgotten who I was by then.\n\n**Tally:**\n\nGoal: 36.\n\nPoints: 19.\n\nBrownie points: 4.\n\nRejections: 0.\n\nPhone numbers: 3.\n\nDates: 2.\n\nAgain; ***polite***, ***constructive***, ***good faith*** suggestions are appreciated.", "subreddit": "ForeverAlone"}

If you want to give me meme advice about therapy, you should probably not read this.\n\nI had a great day at work. I walked into a door before work a couple days ago and my face looks even worse. The area between my mouth and chin looks bad. It's not a major injury, but the fact that I lose myself in thinking to the point I walked into a door closing the opposite way says a lot about how dumb I am. \n\n\nToday I worked with this young woman. She's only 19 but has 20 times the energy I do. She is able to run around doing things while I limp around due to what happens when you stand for 7 hours without being able to sit down. I used to much more easily have energy for work but it's becoming more difficult for me to get the energy to even wake up in the morning. Depression is taking control of my life even more taking away my energy. She is new and I can tell frustrated with my lack of energy. She treats me like a new employee when she's the new employee. She fixed the Christmas card machine. I have nothing against her because we need more employees like her. I just wish I had the energy that she does. \n\nMy co-worker recently sent in pictures of her and her boyfriend. I was told they met when she was 16 and he was 21. Now she's 19 and he's 24. They look like a happy couple. Today her boyfriend came in to see her. He's not chad but above average looking. When he came in he talked to my supervisor because the supervisor was a teacher and he was a student at the school. They hugged and it was good to see all three standing in a circle talking about things while constantly laughing. I stood there watching them feeling left out. I'm not even from the area so I didn't go to school with any of them and I try to block memories of school even if I did go to school with any of them. It still hurt to see them in a circle talking while I just stood there 10 feet away watching them. The boyfriend didn't even say hi to me. I wouldn't be surprised if she told him I was annoying and weird. \n\nEarlier in the day another co-worker was about to leave. She is 20 and we get along. Due to being clumsy I once again put myself at risk for getting in trouble when I reached for something in a box under the counter, tripped, and accidentally brushed up against her butt while tripping. No, it was not on purpose. I would never knowingly do something that wrong and stupid. She gave me an uncomfortable look but she knows I'm clumsy and let it go. I constantly bump into people. I bump into men and women being clumsy so while the reputation isn't a positive, at least they know it's just me being clumsy and nothing more. \n\nI was talking to the 20 year old woman who was about to leave when she grew very uncomfortable looking. I thought I probably did something to creep her out but in this case, it wasn't me who was causing the discomfort. She said a guy who walked past flirts with her. She said the guy is my age and when he tries to flirt with her, she reminds him of her age but he doesn't care. I looked at this guy and the guy was really short. The 20 year old coworker is taller than me. She looks around 5'10\" or 5'11\". This guy was barely taller than the 19 year old co-worker who is 4'11\". She is the short and fit type. The guy was barely taller than her. He looked around 5'1 to 5'2\". It was comical seeing a guy trying to flirt with a woman almost a foot taller than him. This is why I talk about height as often as I do. He's also unattractive so I doubt he has much success with women. He's a year older than me, not much over 5 feet tall, and is flirting with women he has no chance with. It's like he is listening to some PUA type who is telling him to flirt with as many women as possible because his height isn't a big deal compared to his game. The funny thing is, what stops him from being a creep is his height. He's so short, him being creepy was comical to her. She was uncomfortable with him but I got her to laugh making a joke about his height. That sounds bad considering how much I talk about height but if that guy is flirting with random women, I honestly find it almost comical as well. I try to at least be funny when someone is uncomfortable and the source isn't me. I really think someone or some people have convinced that guy that his height isn't a big deal compared to either game if they are PUA's or personality if they are the usual non-FA type. I thought that's probably how women viewed me when I approached them. I was never as direct because I didn't want to get called a creep, get thrown out of a place for being a creep, get the police called for being a creep, get ganged up on for being a creep, or get my ass kicked for being a creep which is why I always tell guys to not approach women in public because people tell them to. They will tell him the worst she can say is no, but there are much worse things that can happen. \n\nIt's almost 1AM here and I've been typing then erasing then typing against for 30 minutes. I have no outlet for being FA except for this sub so sometimes I go on these long rants. It hurts being left out of socializing from being a kid to an adult.\n\nTL;DR: I hurt my face on a door, went to work, saw a co-worker get visited by her boyfriend, was left out on my co-workers talking to the boyfriend, accidentally brushed up against the butt of another co-worker, then saw a guy not much over 5 feet tall try to flirt with my co-worker who is almost a foot taller than him. I'm depressed about another day being FA.\n\nPS, I did expect the downvotes. My venting can sound bad.", "subreddit": "ForeverAlone"}

Today, he has a girlfriend, a new job, and is not coming back!", "author": "Uptons_BJs", "self_text": "Everything in this story is 100% true, I swear.\r\n\r\nA few months ago, I posted here on r/foreveralone asking if someone wants to make a new friend. I got a few responses, but most were skeptical I was real, one was utterly insane, and I got accused of being an organ harvester 3 times. But there was one young man who contacted me, he seemed like a good guy, so we agreed to meet at a mall and say hi. \r\n\r\nI was waiting around a banana republic when this mountain of a man reached out and shook my hand, introducing himself as the guy I was talking to from reddit. He was big, but shy, a bit gloomy, and soft-spoken, and we just wandered around the mall, chatting, and getting to know each other. He was a really nice guy, and we talked about his struggles with women, his hobbies, and himself.\r\n\r\nHe talked about how he wants to update his wardrobe, how he wants to get a girlfriend, and how he wants to find a job. I told him I can definitely help with the first and offer pointers for the second and third. We went to look at a few menswear stores (he eventually got himself some new shirts and a suit), and we said goodbye to each other after a few hours.\r\n\r\nWe kept in touch over the next few weeks, meeting up again and again at the mall. Every week this guy seems to look better and better, as he slowly became more and more confident, he started to fill out his clothes better (also, a well tailored suit is an easy +3 out of 10), his dinner conversation became better, as I kept pumping him up while trying to introduce him to my woman friends. To be honest, looking back I was so invested in him because my own life was a mess (I fucked up my long term relationship, and was a tiny bit living vicariously through him), but his enthusiasm was infectious and you can see the great strides being made every week.\r\n\r\nAround New years, he eventually found a girl, who he took out on a date. The guy was nervous, he kept texting me until he picked her up, but I kept insisting that he had a game plan, a strategy and that things will go great. Turns out she was super into him and they hit it off immediately. Now they\u2019re officially together and I wish them all the best.\r\n\r\nWith the girl problem solved and a new wardrobe, my friend just needed to get a new job. I helped him brush up his resume, gave him some pointers, and within weeks the interviews were rolling in. Tomorrow he is going to officially sign his contract and we\u2019re going celebrating later this week.\r\n\r\nI guess I\u2019m just posting this story because I\u2019m so happy for my friend (and no, I won\u2019t identify him for obvious reasons) If I have to have a point, the point of this story is, sometimes, the good times are just around the corner. But you have to work for it, you have to make the changes, get out there, and eventually things will turn around. It is also my belief that for a lot of people here in r/foreveralone, you\u2019re exceptionally close to making it out, you just need to identify the problem areas, and make effective changes. \r\n\r\nPS: ladies and gentlemen, if you\u2019re in the Toronto area and are looking for a non judgmental friend who is definitely not an organ harvester and who would love to see you succeed in making it out of r/foreveralone, pm me!\r\n\r\nPps: why do I do this? Well, a few years ago I was stifled by loneliness. Stuck in an unfamiliar town, working on a research paper. Well I became friends with this brilliant young lady who eventually became one of my closest friends, and that\u2019s when I realized, when you feel that loneliness is crushing, just having that one friend who tells you you\u2019re the best and is there for you helps a ton, so I want to pass the good deed on so to speak. \r\n", "subreddit": "ForeverAlone"}

There is just no one on this planet who ever will be able to do that for me.\n\nI just look deep within myself and in my heart of hearts that's what I see. It's like my soul is telling me some sliver of cosmic knowledge pertaining to my fate. And to be honest I don't know what to do with the information. It made me sad, because naturally no one is going to react well to being told there's no one for you in this world and that you will die alone. But at the same time I didn't crush me completely. It's like... okay I know that now, I can move on. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnyone else experience something similar? Or am I just crazy?", "subreddit": "lonely"}

I was in a long term relationship between 21 and 26 - It was my first ever relationship and it ended quite badly! It was very toxic for a number of reasons which I didn't really understand or see at the time. He had a major drinking problem which I wasn't aware  of until we moved in together 1.5years later. He was American and came over here to be with me, so getting out of it was a little harder for me than just walking away (not sure if that makes sense). Anyway, it doesn't matter now, but the trauma really affected me. And I only notice how much it affected me now I am 'trying' to date again. \n\nTo deal with the break up, I put all my energy into developing myself in my work, fitness, mental health, spiritual health- opened a business and I am doing well for myself. I developed my personality, and am just about to buy my 1st property with a healthy deposit so I feel like I am proud of myself. \n\nMy issue is: I don't know where or how to meet people. Females for some reason just don't like to approach me, I try and pay compliments when I see fit females or women doing well at networking events etc. But that is where it stops! I don'talk about my work at all because I have experienced some people act funny around me so I modestly say I work in consultancy. \n\nIn 2018 - I did try and 'date' again after the break up in 2015 - I met someone who was smart, and educated and successful in their career - so we 'dated/got to know each other' for approx 4 months. Nothing physical because I am not sure I am ready yet. But, meals, coffee, just being social and adventurous. I was trying to get to know him without too much emotion from sex getting in the way. A clear head because I am trying to date with the intention of marriage and not just fun! \n\nIn the end, I ended it. Because within 3 weeks he had declared love for me and actually contacted my parents to ask for my hand. I had told him about my past and that I needed to take things very slow. I communicated on various occasions that I was looking for date for 1 to 2 years before the talk of marriage really solidified. And he respected that (from what he said) and agreed. I feel like I was open with all elements of how I was feeling with him. When I would get anxiety attacks they would usually be from him pushing me to the 'next level' so quickly. For example, he found out where I lived online, and send me roses and lilies. Which I guess can be cute and a little freaky at the same time. I went with the former after speaking to some gf's - but then the gifts and flowers kept coming. At least once a week. He also had something to say after everything I said. Everything. I couldn't understand it. It was like he was competing with me with knowledge. And I told him many times - you don't have to have an eho with me. Take me as I am and I will do the same. I am not your enemy. But he said, he just liked to share his opinion. (All theeeee time)! \n\nI was suffocated. And the pressure was too much for me to deal with. Especially as he wasn't listening when I was saying, please slow down. When things ended, he actually said to me - You are so independent, if you don't lighten up you will be alone forever. Which I thought was just a reaction to him being hurt maybe. Sometimes men can be really spiteful when they don't get their way. \n\nMy dilemma - All my gf's are married with kids. And housewives. Which is a full time job and I respect them for it. But as a result, I travel alone around the world. All the time. I try and meet people when travelling. But 98% of guys I meet on my travels think this will end in a hookup and its not subtle. The girls tend to be with their bf's so not third wheeling. I end up just chilling alone, or talking to 'older' people - 50's and above. Which is lovely, but sometimes I just want to have a conversation with someone from my age range! \n\nMy parents keep saying my time is going and I need to meet someone. My last single mate is getting married next month and I know in her culture she needs to adapt to the family home so I probably wont be able to see her as much! \n\nHow do any of you independent single ladies deal with loneliness? Just having a good conversation with someone. I work from home so that is another challenge and adds to the isolation. \n\nI am trying to be 'open' to meeting people - but I dont want to use Tinder etc. I may be in the Millennial Bracket - but I like old school courting! \n\n Help! and sorry for the long essay!

It seemed like I was destined to be alone, and that nobody would ever want to spend any time with me... Let alone date me.\n\nLast year was one of the worst years of being alone for me. Friends i thought were friends basically ghosted me when I stopped making any effort to contact them. Family seemed pretty content that I wasn't going to date anyone ever. Basically, I was feeling pretty worthless and figured this is how the rest of my life would go. Last year I had managed to secure a date with a women, we planned on getting drinks and then hang out for a bit. Well I got to the bar and waited... and waited... texted her, but got no response. I was stood up only to get a text from her in the morning saying she was tired after work and went to bed. Life was getting really depressing, I really felt like I was just done with making any effort to date anyone.\n\nI recently moved out of my parents house, and have started living on my own with 1 roommate. We have different work schedules so without having any family/friends to see everyday, i've become more and more lonely. I decided one night when I was drunk playing video games that I would give tinder a shot. I've been told i'm average looking (not sure if accurate or people just being nice.) i'm decently fit and also dress pretty well. Another thing to note is i'm 5ft 8 if anyone else understands the under 6ft struggle.\n\nAfter downloading tinder I begun swiping right on basically everyone. I got a decent amount of matches but nobody I was actually interested in, I mainly just wanted to see if I would even match with anyone. After narrowing down who I thought i'd like the most I began messaging the ones i liked. I would either get a 1 message reply then ghosted... or just no reply. Beginning to lose all hope the next day I started only swiping right on people who I liked (because i'm sober now and not thirsty lol) and I get messaged first by an extremely attractive girl. I'm like, \"oh i'm totally gonna get ghosted after i respond\" but to my surprise we talk all day without any interruption. Things go really well and last Monday we met up for coffee. We hit it off quite well but i'm still thinking i'm going to get ghosted at any minute.\n\nWe make plans for Saturday night for her to come to my apartment, cook some food, make some drinks, then watch a movie. Saturday comes around and she actually shows up to my surprise. The cooking goes well. The convo goes well. The drinks were good. We are having a great time. We go up to my bedroom and watch a movie for about 10 minutes. Things get hot and heavy and we make out, cuddle, and talk. She goes down on me and then stays the night. After lacking basically any human contact/affection for most of my life the entire scenario is still surreal to me. As much as I hear about the classic \"hit the gym and stop being ugly\" stuff you read on the internet... It just seems like luck.\n\nWe are still texting and already making plans to do more stuff but i'm still having issues believing she isn't just going to ghost me at any minute. I have a really hard time thinking I have any worth at all due to the countless times i've been neglected by females.

I live in my place 24/7, never going outside, and the only thing that makes me feel less alone is my music and my pets. But even then I crave a friendship or anyone, just to be myself and not seem like I am some horrible person that they often make me feel. I tried online, that doesn't work either and with someone who actually has social anxiety, I try very hard, but it seems every time I get a bit comfortable around people, someone has to come and take that away. Maybe I just need to quit trying, and just accept the fact that I will always be a misunderstood lonely caged bird. At least I tried...\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEdit: Thank you so very much to all those who commented. I considered a lot on what you guys wrote, and I guess I should explain a bit on why I feel like I should give up on friendship for good. As growing up, I was not allowed to have friendship due to my abusive mother. I grew up not allowed to show negative emotions and only respect others, despite how others treat me. I held a lot on my emotions and opinions, for I feared of being mistreated. This stood with me, even now, the fear of speaking up and being myself. I do now try to speak my mind, and I do like to be free to be myself, but I always wonder why I am always so alone. \n\nIt seems as if you do not act a certain way that most desire, you are not accepted. I do admit, I envy those who have friends, because I never truly got to experience any of that, even as growing up. To me, friendship, even a romantic relationship, is perplexing. I did have a group that they consider themselves as my 'friends' when I was a teen. However, their pressure for me to do drugs and have sex with strangers, made me realize they are not what I would call 'friend's', so I dumped them all, leaving me with no one to talk to. \n\nRelationships are hard for me to express my emotion due to how I grew up, and tend to lock up everything, fear that I would be looked down at, like when I was a child. \n\nSociety scares me so much, that I rather stay indoors than go out and end up with a panic attack. I have tried online to find what people call 'online friends', and it always seems superficial, as well like an RP that people are acting out. \n\nAt this point, with my age, I don't think I can ever have a good solid gold friendship, and it is heartbreaking if I must admit. I know a lot of people who are like me have accepted that fact about themselves, and I want to accept myself. I think I have accepted it after all these years being lonely. It's just some days, I wish I didn't have to...\n\n I wish I knew a little more about all the different types of relationship.  Family, love, kindness, compassion, friendship, being cherished, all that a child deserved to grow up knowing they're welcomed in life and not be afraid.\n\n So yes, some days, we are not always so strong and accepting how things came to be, and today is one of those days where I realized how much I missed out in life and just wish I didn't.\n\n&amp;#x200B;", "subreddit": "lonely"}

Yep them, i did have a best friend but I was jealous of how perfect her life was that was making my life far more toxic then it is now so i had to fade away from her. I'm a seriously anxious person, I'm a overthinker I get beyond jealous at everything and in general I feel I'm actually a bad person at times weirdly.

Basically (I love that word) I feel because im distancing myself from my friends and also because i never really felt comfortable with any of my friends of pretty much anyone I always felt awkward it's kind of rubbed off on potential relationships, like i had this guy message me tonight from work that I like however i didn't open his message for like an hour because i didn't know what to reply without sounding awkward or boring or weird like i genuinely get worried no one will like me for me, i mean I've always been awkward but relationship wise im extremely jealous I'm insecure I'm weird I just don't feel me and relationships work. Pretty sure this rant made no sense but basically I'm just odd and i sometimes just want to end it all because the pressure of growing up and all these insecurities are far too much for me.

Of course, friendships should never feel formulaic in any way. But I can't help but feel like that's the best way to describe it. It's almost like they feel like they have to be friends with Me sometimes. Although I'm sure that's nonsense. Apart from spending time with My best buddies, I pretty much hang out with Myself. I practice guitar for hours in My bedroom and don't come out until dinner, I skateboard at the end of My street by Myself, and I write stories, poetry, and lyrics to anything and everything. There's a certain sort of closure that comes with being all by Yourself. And it's not a bad thing. But I can't help but feel like having friends can be more trouble than it's worth sometimes.

I make people laugh a lot. I Like to think It's the best thing about me.  But I usually try my best not to seem too overboard? I have really bad anxiety, actually training service dog now for it, which is really nice. He's the cutest little Malmute ever.\n\nAnyways, since I went to a lot of different schools as a little kid, I never really bothered getting close to people because I knew id move in 3 months. So when i finally got to high school and I was told that we would be here for a few years, I was pretty happy!  I met a girl named Lauren who seemed nice and we got along really well. I also met a boy named Rory and his girlfriend Destiny. I liked these kids a lot. They were really awesome to hang around. But eventually they stopped inviting me to things and I didn't understand why. \n\nThey'd post things on Instagram, they'd brag about what a fun weekend they had in front of me. One day I decided to pm Rory, and asked him why I wasn't being invited to things. I asked him to be honest, because I genuinely didn't understand. \n\nNow I dont remember exactky what he said but it went down like this... M= Me, R= Rory\n\nM: Hey man, been wondering why you havnt been inviting me to things lately. Please be honest.\n\nR: well, Lauren and Destiny just kind of thought you were a weird kid? To be honest, it's like walking on eggshells around you\n\n(I didn't understand why it would be walking on eggshells around me. I barely talk most of the time) \n\nM:  what do you mean?\n\nR: you're just really annoying and we keep you around because we don't really want to be rude?  but that's really it. \n\nM: oh. K.\n\nAt this point I was pretty mad, and basically heartbroken, because i started to realise thag they weren't  laughing with me when they made jokes about me, they were laughing  at me this whole time. saying things to my face Like \"you look like an anorexic 12 year old\".  Which they knew I had those medical issues because of an abusive parent. \n\nI took a few days offline after that, because my aunt had died the same week, and we were really close, so I didn't go to school for a little bit either. \n\nWhen I got back, I had neglected to straighten my hair, so i left it curly that day. I sat in class away from everyone else and Rory walks in. I put my headphones on and looked away from him. \n\nI see him signalling to my headphones and talking so I take them off. \n\n\"Did you get a haircut?\" He asked. At this point, I had two options. Basically let them keep laughing behind my back and treating like I'm not a person, or to have some self respect. I look away from him and ignore him and everyone else in that friend group for the rest of the year. \n\nI just wish I had said something to him. Out of everyone I think he was the only one who felt bad about how they treated me. \n\nEnded up leaving that school a year later, and met some new people in my first year of University.

My idea is that you get a small group of people (2-4 people) and have them talk to each other, share advice, give feedback, let the others vent etc the success rate would be better. Then you're personally interested in this other person's life, and want them to succeed and they hopefully want the same for you, so you support each other.I think it would be especially nice for the friendless among us, or those who can't talk about this to their friends.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAs for the name, in the US prisoners would be chained together when taken outside the prison, often they'd escape at that time but they'd still be chained together.

It's pretty much same like others- I am an introvert, have been depressed for quite a long time which has decreased my productivity, fucked up my studies and increased my libido (idk if that sounds weird). My taste in music is different from people around me, I play only the CS:GO game, read books but suck at writing and if I have to speak (presentation in class or a similar activity) it makes me cry (idk why). For the last seven years people have been making fun of me and even I make fun of them but somewhere I don't know why I get hurt when they don't really intend to hurt me. \n\nAlso I cannot fight back. It's the worst quality I've. I mean why the fuck in hell and heavens can't I just fight back and hurt people. This world deserves the storm that it gets. I know being too nice is just going to crush me. I try to man up ( I think that's the word) but I fail. I fail miserably every single time I try to do that. \n\nAnd it's one of the reasons I don't want to be committed to someone or get married and rejected even the ones who loved me. Because I have to provide the girl/women safety, save and rescue her from the demons but how do I guard someone else when I can't do it for myself ? How do I fight someone else's devil when I can't fight my own ones ? And besides that I don't earn so I can't take her out for a lunch or dinner date and shopping ( I mean women love shopping) or surprise them. \n\nPretty much same with the friends. I can't fight for a friend and what kind of a friend would I be if I don't fight for him and help him when he need me? Why would someone befriend me when he knows I won't be able to help him in the bad times ? You can't just be with him only when it's the happy times. Friends share happiness and help in crisis. \n\nAnd I'm doing nothing to make my life better but writing this stupid post which some of you who I won't ever come across are going to read ( or maybe not as it's too long). \n\nMoreover I don't look good either.

I have a zest for it. But it doesn't seem to get better and by the time it'd get better, I guess it'd be too late. I'm just holding on to it for my parents. I know that all they have is me. And so I just want to give them every moment of happiness and joy that they deserve. I just want to be here until they're here making sure it's peaceful.

For background, I am an exjw. Basically I was raised fundamentalist Christian but now I'm an atheist. If my family found out they wouldn't speak to me. I was raised in a way so that I never was allowed ro join sports, scouts or martial arts. No holidays, birthdays, no hanging out with people outside the religion. So I had no people my age to socialize with growing up aside from school.\n\nI'm in college. I lean right poltically but I'm black. I never bring up race too much in my life but I'm starting to think it's a more significant part of my experience than I thought. \n\nAs a person I'm generally decent at making friends one on one. In groups, it gets more difficult. I can handle groups but I'm generally a quiet person and I would say I'm pretty nice. However, I know I have a mean streak and can say very hurtful things so when I hang out with other guys I am a bit quiet. As many of you know, young and even olders guys can get rowdy and just riff and make fun of each other forever. It's a bonding type of thing. This is why I say I tend to stay quiet. When I make a comeback, people don't necessarily get mad but they're surprised at the statement I've made.  So I sometimes make lame comebacks that don't do much but continue the riffing. My true riffing is always met with surprise and becomes a topic for weeks on end. \n\nSo I made friends with a group of people and they do genuinely like me. I'm not annoying like some other people they know but at the same time, most of them have known eachother since middle school and I'm the \"new\" one. This doesn't bother me much. What I did find weird is that whenever I come sit with that group, they repeat my name alot. Just as a joke to hum my name or sing it. They do this to other friends but not nearly as much as me.  One guy asks me the same questions over and over. In any case, they're all cool guys, decently intelligent, they've given me rides before, I work out with them at times. Of course there are some I like more than others. \n\nHowever, it seems that every time I see them they point out that I'm black. They didn't grow up with many black people (they're all white or middle eastern/south asian) so I get it. They also never really met a black person like me (they and most of the people I know in my life call me an oreo or a white guy in a black guy's body. I'm reserved, majoring in a hard STEM subject, I speak regular English and I prefer rock to most hip hop). I don't think I'm a \"special\" black person nor am I ashamed of my heritage. I have no issue with racist jokes if they're funny enough and I'm not uncomfortable about the topic of race. It's just that every time I speak to them, my race is mentioned multiple times. \n\nSome of the jokes are about my \"junk\" and how big it must be, saying I'm going to end up in prison, get shot down by police, my whole family is white and I just turned out black, telling me where I should sit(rosa parks reference), etc. They were shocked when I said I'm not a fan of fried chicken.  I have brought up their ancestry at times as a joke but if I make a terrorist joke or Islam joke sometimes they aren't laughing much (this applies to my old high school too, many people, especially Muslims in my experience, can dish it out but can't take it back in). Or I'll say that the white ones must be cucks because they are always talking about black penis (they have often talked about me cucking their friends and having sex with white girls even though I have no experience with that). If my comeback is too good then I'm \"arrogant\".  One of the guys complained about people across the room being loud and assumed they were black but if you looked at them none of them were black at all.\n\nI don't find any of this offensive. I'm not a social justice warrior, I have thick skin. Some of it is actually funny if It's timed right. It's just that it is every time I see them this is mentioned. I tested myself to see if I was exaggerating and it turns out today they spoke about that subject for little over an hour. Even a girl who was sitting with us (white) said \"Poor _\". \n\nThese guys all acknowledge that I'm smart and that I'm nice which is cool. They even apologized today because they thought they went overboard. I said I'm fine and It's ok. I don't really want an apology, I think It's healthy to make jokes together as guys. It's just that it gets stale if it's the same thing every time and it's specifically about being a certain race. \n\nI guess to give perspective, let's say you're white or Asian and you have some black and Latino friends and every time you spoke to them they said you had a small penis, you can't dance, you should invent something or help them with their math homework, you secretly want to call the police on them, you can't cook or season your food/you think eveything is spicy/no culture (if you're white), you can't drive (if you're Asian). \n\nOverall this group is better than another group I know where people started ignoring me gradually and one guy apologized for using the n word with a hard r to insult someone on the road (I didn't give that guy trouble since I know he wasn't being malicious but it's just offputting). But I think this other group just focuses on race a lot when I'm around and I never bring it up. ", "subreddit": "ForeverAlone"}

The only thing close to a \"relationship\" I've ever had was an online interaction (that's what I'm calling it/is), with a girl from half the country away (2000+ miles!!!). I wasted years on her. I thought she loved me. I loved her so deeply that every single day I say to myself quietly, \"I loved you... I loved you... I loved you... I loved you...\" It never ends. They lied about their age - twice, they failed to keep things I told them/that were meant as a secret (like some things that happened to me) - telling other people/being surprised that they weren't supposed to do that, getting mad at me over random stupid things. Although I did from times vent my rage at her in many forms, and other things.

I mean I think I am, why I stare into the mirror for moments at a time every single day.

This was a pretty big boost to my confidence until I asked a couple of them out, to which they agreed, and got stood up twice. Then, today, I was feeling especially lonely (and foolish) and matched with a girl that simply said she was looking for friends with benefits. I was a bit skeptical, but hopeful she was for real. She asked if I was down to be fwb, and I agreed. Then, she asked if I had kik, which should have been another red flag, but I went along anyway. So we get chatting on kik about where we each were from, what schools we went to, and sent a few pictures of ourselves back and forth, but then she asked for a dick-pic. This was where I am the most disappointing in myself, because I knew something was up and I was just too naive to stop myself, but I sent her one.

I frantically blocked and reported her and hoped and prayed everything would be alright.

Nothing that matters to me. I feel like I don\u2019t exist anymore, and the want(need?) for attention makes me feel like an attention whore child that needs other people to get along in life. I hate going to class and not existing. I have moved around my entire life, and while I have a few good friends, they have either moved away, I have moved away, or I have had fallouts with them, which is my current situation. \n\nI feel sick to myself when I feel a huge dopamine rush when someone asks me to do something for them, like picking up their pencil or letting them borrow a phone charger, I immediately feel bad after I realize that conversation will most likely never go past the few words that someone directs towards me asking for something.\n\nI hate being a little bitch. I don\u2019t want to admit that I feel upset or depressed, but it\u2019s so hard to shake the feeling when I get home from a long day at school, where I accomplished nothing, because I am bad at studying and procrastinate. They say people who grew up trying wish they had fun, and people that grew up having fun wish they tried. I have done neither. I graduate high school in a few months (maybe), and I have no one. Nothing. I have plans, and I will move on eventually, I will force myself to if I have to, but I still hate it.

{"post_id": "aoemys", "created_utc": 1549615528, "title": "I like taking the bus", "author": "[deleted]", "self_text": "It's cold. A sort of damp, slushy cold, what with winter starting to wane and all. My sneakers, all full of holes and torn at the edges, aren't made out for slogging through the mush that remains of once bright snow. In only a matter of minutes, my feet are soaking wet. And so, I decide to take the bus home. I pick a spot to stand in, the middle section of the bus, next to the radiator. I push my feet as close to the comforting, scalding-yet-not metal plates, to try and warm my now numb feet, and as usual, start to look around.\n\nSee, I vaguely remember writing something similar early-autumn-ish. About taking the bus, I mean. Because really, it's one of my favourite activities, even if I might say or think otherwise at times. But something about cold weather brings out the most in people. It pushes them to do unthinkable things - like actually talking to eachother. Can you imagine that? Complete strangers picking up a bit of small talk, either to complain about the weather or to just spend time as the bus crawls along, struck by yet another pothole that was conveniently covered by snowdrifts. Where I'm from, this is considered a small miracle.\n\nIn the cold of winter, it really does warm the heart.\n\nA pair of university students start to chat on the opposite side of the corridor. A girl and a boy, each wearing a thick blue parka, jeans - the water creeping up along the fabric, creating a beautiful gradient of dark and light blues - and brown winter boots. I don't pay attention to what they talk about, something related to their last lecture, but rather the way they talk. The girl smiles tenderly at the boy, not taking her eyes off of his face. The boy looks away often, shyly, but continues talking, throwing soft glances at the girl every once in a while. They both nod fervently after every sentence with a sense of sincerity. The boy finally relaxes a bit, slipping his hands out of his pockets, gaining enough courage to meet her eyes with his own. They blush, cheeks almost aglow with red. I turn my back to give them some privacy.\n\nBehind me stands a young mother with a baby carriage. She looks nervous, awkwardly so. Her mouth, not frowning nor smiling, is stuck in a straight line, lips tense and brow furrowed. Her hands switch between fidgeting around with the carriage and her knotted hair, trying to straighten it out as best she can, worrying about her appearance constantly. She tightens her belt, pulls at her coat, cleans her sleeves and props up her beret with an uneasy regularity. Why? Her daughter acts up a bit, and I notice a glint of desperation as she scolds the child. The bus stops abruptly and she hurtles into me, losing her footing. I smile and wave it off as she apologizes, her face white with needless shame. If only she could see herself through my eyes, how sweet she looks.\n\nAn old man stumbles and is given a seat by a kind stranger, a man in much too warm clothes even for the winter. Is he ill to be wrapped up in layers like that? The old man says something in a foreign language, hoping to receive an answer, but the stranger does not understand. The old man waits for a bit, but turns away in a frown, looking outside, his breath fogging up the window. He, like so many others, are from a different time, part of an older generation of people sent here by an occupying state. To work, and eventually, to live. He still wears his old fur hat and rough leather coat, a pair of black knitted mittens with a white diamond pattern. Positively ancient, slightly tattered dress pants cover up his heavy boots, a plastic bag sat carefully on top of them, full of who knows what. I hope he still has someone to go home to.\n\nYoung and old, from all walks of life, forming a microcosm right in front of me, in this very bus. The ways they move, some stiff, some with a flowing grace even in their thick winter clothing. The ways they *look*, some staring at their phones, some out the windows and some at each-other. The ways they sound, some sniffling from the cold with hoarse voices, some bellowing with laughter and passion. The way their faces change expressions in a flash, as the bus struggles to make its way uphill. It all distracts me from an ever-present loneliness. \n\nTo study someone closer - not only their outer shell, but the workings of their mind. To not only see or hear them, simulating closeness, but to know and feel them, a gentle touch of skin and spirit to remind yourself that you're still human, that you still exist. To form a mutual bond of trust, fascination and obsession with that very someone. Isn't that what we all dream of? The good news is that the distraction worked.\n\nI get off the bus at my usual stop next to a renovated stationmaster's cabin, having to jump feet first into a deep snowdrift. But I don't mind. I smile and start making my way down the street.\n\nSometimes, all it takes is a short bus-ride home.", "subreddit": "lonely"}

In this post: [https://www.reddit.com/r/ForeverAlone/comments/ab5n1z/welp\\_im\\_gonna\\_do\\_it/](https://www.reddit.com/r/ForeverAlone/comments/ab5n1z/welp_im_gonna_do_it/), I committed to said exercise, in addition to outlining some parameters. Because few bars are open, and few people attend bars, on weekdays, however, I have since amended the exercise; now aiming to speak to three women on Fridays, three on Saturdays and three on Sundays, for the four weekends of January, for a total of 36. The following post comprises my twelfth such account, my account of the night of 08/02/2019.\n\nWent to bar. Had a drink. Ate some chips. Spoke to four women. Asked one for number. Got it. Went home.\n\nWas that a somewhat, \\*ahem\\*, uninteresting account? Maybe. But the fact is... I'm starting to grow kinda bored with this. It's starting to grow into something of a chore; into something to cross off of my to-do list. Every night by now, it's pretty much the same routine. Inasmuch as I haven't really been doing it for very long, I can't help but suspect that I've already learned about as much as I'm ever going to learn from it, and gotten about as much as I'm ever going to get from it. While I ostensibly embarked on this exercise in order to get better at talking to women, the simple fact of the matter is that I don't actually *need* to get better at this, because, unlike how it is for many men here, this isn't, and never was, something I had trouble with in the first place. Whatever my lack of romantic relationships is attributable to, it isn't this. No, this doesn't mean that I'm going to drop out - I intend to follow this through until I reach the goal I set for myself - but the truth is my enthusiasm for it is decreasing; by this stage, it kinda feels as though I'm just pointlessly grinding. So my accounts might be less detailed from now on.\n\nI know that up until now, I've been denying getting lucky or being naturally good at this - instead attributing my success to the fact that this isn't as hard as everyone makes it out to be. But, well... if you count the times both before and during this exercise, I've asked about ten women for their numbers during my life, and of those, literally not a single one has ever not given it to me. Nor has a single woman ever behaved coldly or unreceptive towards me. I've literally never once been explicitly rejected. Once again, I feel like I need to insert a disclaimer denying that I'm boasting here, but I'm finding talking to women and getting their numbers to be such an effortless endeavor that I can hardly even envision how any men have trouble with it at all. And this runs so contrary to most other men's stated experiences that... well, I'm starting to reconsider. Perhaps I *am* \\[A\\]; naturally good at this or \\[B\\]; unnaturally lucky after all.\n\nI'm still on for that second date next Tuesday. However, I'm going out to a restaurant tomorrow night, so perhaps I'll try asking her to come then instead. (Seeing as how I never seem to end up doing it, I've decided to abandon any pretense of enacting this exercise on Saturdays whatsoever).\n\n**Tally:**\n\nGoal: 36.\n\nPoints: 22.\n\nBrownie points: 5.\n\nRejections: 0.\n\nPhone numbers: 4.\n\nDates: 2.\n\nAgain; ***polite***, ***constructive***, ***good faith*** suggestions are appreciated.", "subreddit": "ForeverAlone"}

I'm in my mid 20s and I was reflecting on how I behaved in highschool a decade ago. Although I was never a self loathing FA/incel type I had my blunder years too.\n\n- Stop talking to the girl you feel friend zoned by. She's consuming too much of your attention. Value your time. You're missing out on other opportunities. If you're still feeling that you can be *trapped in the friend zone* you're not ready to have female friends you're attracted to. Gain some experience with women before trying to balance that one.\n\n- Always flirt with new women you meet. Even if you're not particularly attracted to them it's practice and who knows maybe she'll win you over or something. If that happens follow your heart. You'll probably break up with your first girlfriend anyway so live in the moment.\n\n- Listen to your feelings about women you meet. If you think you're going to want to fuck her it will behoove you to understand this. You're a man you need to be decisive. The worst thing you can do is be indecisive and come off as a low confidence creep.\n\n- Ask her out as soon as it's appropriate if you want to fuck her. This is a window measured in days. If she says no or it's not appropriate because she has a boyfriend or is otherwise unavailable *read uninterested* move on. Value yourself and remember to be nice. \n\n- Use numbers to your advantage. You'll talk to dozens of women to get dates. You'll go on several dates before you find a woman worth your time. If you miss out on a few friendships and even potential dates by valuing yourself and your time you've more than made up for it in numbers.", "subreddit": "ForeverAlone"}

Sorry if I'm posting in the wrong place, please let me know if so! \n\nLet me start off by saying I'm 18 I'm a woman and I'm a virgin, I've never had an actual relationship, I struggle with anxiety, OCD and an ED, all three of which control my life, but I make a huge effort to be friendly and get out there, but at times it seems no one really wants to have anything to do with me... I keep telling myself over and over: \"I just need to get out there, to meet new people, be patient.\"\nBut everyday I feel more and more hopeless. I just want to meet new people and make friends. \n\nHonestly I had managed to cope with it until recently... I have 1 really close friend, and I hang out with her friend group because I'm lucky enough she includes me, she's my best friend and her friends are nice too.. but lately it seems like all they do is make fun of me for being a virgin. laughing and joking, purposefully asking me what certain sexual acts are to test how 'innocent' I am. I may be a virgin but I'm not stupid...\nI know it's just a joke but it's yet another reminder that I'm alone and inadequate, when they start discussing and bragging about sex I feel so alone, I wish I could ask them to just stop the joking but I genuinely fear the confrontation, I don't want to lose them. \n\nKnowing I'm a virgin makes me feel like I'm less of a woman, like I'm a child, I feel so incompetent, I feel like even if I did have a relationship it wouldn't work because I can't be comfortable with someone, hell I can't even make new friends let alone relationships...\n\nI don't know... part of me needs to know is it possible to meet someone who id actually be comfortable enough with?

I\u2019ve been bullied by people arround me (especially females) about my eyes being slanted which resembles the chinese. Don\u2019t get me wrong, theres nothing wrong with chinese peeps but i don\u2019t like being called chinese in a really rude way or something that is in an insulting manner. This pretty much lowered my self-esteem. I feel like girls are attracted more towards tall and good-looking guys. This is really painful knowing that girls don\u2019t like me because of my height, my slanted eyes and how unattractive my looks are compared to others. I wish i have a girl that likes me, that can fix me, that can prevent me from being lonely. I\u2019m tired of hugging my pillow imagining that the pillow is the lover of my life where i can be happy with. The sensation of hugging someone and hugging a pillow is really different. Every night, i\u2019ll have to face the feelings of being lonely and sad. When will this ever stop though, i want my heart to be bloomy and beautifully coloured with love and affection too. Plus, since i\u2019ve entered college now, the friends that i used to be really close with, friends that i can have fun with, are not even close to me anymore. They don\u2019t ask me join to them on having fun anymore for example hangover, late night chit chats at the restaurant, late night drives and all. I feel really sad and alone. Those feelings really made my chest become heavy. I don\u2019t know how to comprehend with the feelings that i\u2019ve experienced in the past, or the feelings that i\u2019m experiencing right now. Looking at my friend\u2019s instagram where they are having fun with their own girlfriend or where they are having fun with their friends. I\u2019ve been experiencing this feeling 2 years and a half now. I\u2019ve thought of many ways on how to kill myself but i don\u2019t know why arent those thoughts executed on me. But i do have one thought that is still being executed but i\u2019m still not dead by it. It\u2019s basically having no brakes on my bike, so i\u2019ll cycle down the road full of cars with no brakes. But i\u2019m still alive though, i did crash a car once but i didn\u2019t suffer any injuries even though i didn\u2019t wear any helmet. However, the car did get damaged heavily is a large dent where my body banged on it and i had to pay the repairments. Then, theres my parents who are really busy with their work considering they are doctors, they even work during the weekends. We (as a family) hardly go out on a day out or eating in a restaurant. Despite the amount of salary they are making, i don\u2019t think it buys us happiness. I sometimes cry when i think about all these. It\u2019s hard having an empty space in your heart knowing nothing can fill it in. I miss the days when my well-being is joyous and very happy. I am still waiting for my time to come to depart from my own lifeless shell that is exhausted with all this. Life is truly wonderful, it is, but it isn\u2019t wonderful to everybody. Anyways, this is just me trying to let things out from my mind as i\u2019ve never done this before. Sorry for wasting your time though, wishing you lifetime of happiness if you\u2019re reading this.

Now of course I'll give the following disclaimers.... I am not entitled to a girlfriend, women can be FA's, and I am only speaking in generalities.  They only had guys to interview (maybe they talked to women at another time or in another area).  I started out talking about how a lot of guys imagine that women have the luxury of just sitting back and letting the messages pour in when that isn't entirely accurate.  I was talking about how I used to think I wasn't so bad looking but now after using online dating it's hard not to think I'm ugly or just very unattractive at best. I said that since time began it's generally the guys job to initiate contact so no matter how you tweak a site there will always be many more men messaging women than women messaging men.  Over the course of the interview I talked about how it's very frustrating but if you put yourself in women's shoes and consider how many messages even an average looking woman gets (not counting perverted messages) you realize that while it's not impossible to get a girlfriend, the odds are just so massive. Also I pointed out how guys have to craft a perfect profile and really have very little leeway because it seems like if you say one \"wrong thing\", don't ask for her number/ask to meet up fast enough or ask for it too soon, then she moves on and the majority of guys just don't have that luxury.  To be fair I don't blame a woman for picking the best option.  They ended by asking what I would do to improve online dating. I said the following:\n\nMaybe limiting the number of messages you can send per day.  \n\nWomen have to send a small number of messages before they can see who messaged them (although I don't think that would do us any good)\n\nMake sure that the profile states racial dating preferences, religious preferences, if they want someone to make a certain amount of money, or have a certain amount of education.  \n\nA way to ban the guys sending perverted messages.\n\nAlthough this is impossible I wish there was a way to get the women off the site who are only there as an ego boost and have no interest in getting to know someone.\n\nUltimately I told them that online dating is awesome if you are a man or a woman who is high on the looks scale and that I wasn't sure anything could really be done that hasn't already been done.  Looks make up over 90% of the online dating game which makes sense when all you have are photos and a profile.  This is why I laugh at the people who give the advice to make a better profile.  \n\nNow I'll end with this:\n\nI think even us FA's are capable of finding someone even if it is more difficult or involves a little or a lot of luck.  I will say I think that meeting a woman in real life has an advantage because I think a lot of guys may not \"shine\" till someone takes the time to get to know them and not everyone can have great chemistry/instant spark on a first meeting, but with online dating you have to have that or you are done, and even if you do have a spark the next guy she swipes to could have a bigger spark.

I was so excited to finally be going on a date (I haven't been on a date for three years, not for lack of trying). She mentioned how her dog chewed up her makeup brushes a few weeks ago, and she can't buy new ones any time soon, so the night before I went to like 3 different stores trying to find the makeup brushes that she lost to her dog so that I could suprise her with them the next day. I spent a shitload of money. I got home that night, get in bed and couldn't sleep because I was so damn nervous and I was really hoping this could go well. I only ended up getting like an hour and a half of sleep because I was thinking about literally everything that I could do the next day to fuck it all up. When I woke up the next day, I noticed that she had posted on her Snapchat story a ton, but hadn't replied to my message where I asked her where she wanted me to pick her up. I shot her another text, and a few more in the few hours between when I woke up and when our date was supposed to be. She never answered. She never even opened the message. I just feel so god damn stupid because I spent all that money and went to all those stores, I stayed up so late because I was nervous as hell, got up extra early, showered 3 times, probably brushed my teeth for like 20 minutes because I was a nervous wreck. It was so disheartening to find out that my date that I was both really excited and terrified to mess up wasn't going to happen. I really did like this girl and you may think if it as stupid but it really tore me up that I could get so close to the thing I've wanted for so long and then at any time the carpet could just be yanked out from under me.\n\nThis is the closest thing to a date I could get in almost 3 years.

They will then proceed to give you one or two pieces of hit and run advice like \"shower more\", \"get fit\", \"love yourself\", which, if you're here, you would probably say is ineffective.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf you examine the posts here on r/foreveralone, routinely people would argue that they are lonely due to one singular issue or a small number of issues. For instance, they would argue that they're ugly, or shy, or fat, etc.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFundamentally, humans are complex and multidimensional. Now if you are forever alone, it is my belief that there does not exist a singular fix or singular reason why. Even if that singular reason is a major blocker that is severely impacting your social appeal, there are probably ways to correct it or to compensate for its negative effects. After all, if it is true that the only reason why you're lonely is because your fat (to use an example) why are there millions of overweight people in happy relationships? 64% of Canadians are overweight or obese, and I can assure you that the foreveralone rate in Canada cannot be anywhere close to 64%. These issues could be compensated for, after all, millions have done it. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow there exists this idea that there is someone out there for everyone. As a statistician, I'm inclined to believe that fundamentally, this idea is true, but practically it might not matter. If there exists 7 billion people on earth, there has to be at least one person in that group who is willing to date you.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThere is this fundamental idea in modern economics that humans are horrible at evaluating tail risk. To put it in easier to understand terms, humans are very bad at understanding odds that are too small. Well, even if there does exist 1 person out of 7 billion for you, the odds of you meeting that 1 is exceedingly small. To your brain, that 1 in 7 billion might as well not exist. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow if you want a lasting friendship or a romantic relationship, you need to get your foot in the door first. Convince the other person to give you that first chance, so things could develop. The issue is, to those with low social appeal, they can't get their foot in the door. In order to improve your odds, you need to break down the blockers reducing your appeal, but merely breaking down 1 might very well have such a tiny impact on your odds, you can't perceive the change. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nImagine this absurd scenario: Billy is forever alone and has minimal appeal to women. 0.01% of women are willing to go on a first date with Billy. Obviously, Billy asks out a handful of local women but has no success. Imagine if hypothetically 1 in 10 women are willing to date a man with poor personal hygiene and Billy has poor hygiene. Billy\u2019s friends tell him to shower more, and he does, which effectively increases his sex appeal by a factor of 10, now 0.1% of women are willing to date Billy now! But then, even after that massive increase, the percentage is so low, Billy doesn\u2019t perceive any difference. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf you think of each individual blocker as a filter, filtering away a portion of the population, every single time you clear one you will see your appeal increase exponentially. But fixing any given blocker will yield a very small, almost imperceptible amount of marginal improvement. To continue with the last example, if Billy is overweight and 50% of the population is unwilling to date someone overweight. Billy could go work hard in the gym and get fit, doubling his appeal, but still only appeal to 0.2% of the population. At 0.02% appeal, Billy can go ask out 10 people, and still have a 98% chance none of them will say yes to him. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis is why singular pieces of advice almost never seem to have much of an effect for forever alone people. When your baseline is so low, eliminating any individual blocker has too little of an effect to actually meaningfully change one\u2019s situation. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe solution to this issue is an approach called CI/CD, continuous integration and continuous deployment. Originally a software engineering methodology, I believe that it is also the single most effective way to improve one\u2019s social success. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe first thing to throw out is the advice many people often receive: \u201cdon\u2019t worry, it will come naturally\u201d. Yes, to a lot of people things do come naturally, but if you\u2019re forever alone, I think it is safe to say that your appeal to other people is very low. If you only appeal to 0.01% of people, think about how hard it is to find that 0.01%. Obviously change is needed. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBut do not think of a change as a set of finite goals or a checklist. You have to constantly be on the move, constantly figure out where you need to improve and what the blockers are before trying to either compensate for or vanquish them. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis is where a patient, honest and understanding friend becomes very useful. When you\u2019re constantly changing multiple variables, it is difficult to assess the effectiveness of each change. Having an honest friend around to give you pointers and to eliminate the worst ideas keeps you on the right direction. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe second important thing is to constantly put yourself out there, and to meet new people. We can sit down and figure out all the theories and strategies to increase your appeal, but it doesn\u2019t matter unless you\u2019re going to actual social situations and evaluating their success. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo why is it CI/CD? You must continuously integration new ideas and improvements into your routine, while continuously deploying them in real social situations to assess their effectiveness and figure out next steps. By doing so, you might not be able to destroy every single blocker that negatively impacts your appeal, but at least you might be able to eliminate enough of them that your appeal improves exponentially. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLet\u2019s be honest here. If you\u2019re forever alone, odds are you have a very low social appeal. In those circumstances, it is likely that it is a combination of various factors that is keeping your social appeal low. In order to break out of long term loneliness, you need to continuously integration various improvements and changes into your life. And well, if that doesn\u2019t work, at least you can hope the continuous deployment allows you to encounter a large enough number of people you find someone. ", "subreddit": "ForeverAlone"}

We value relationships so much because when we express our emotions or thoughts to other humans and we conected on chemical level releasing hormones like serotonin and dopamine making us less stressful about our problems thats why if take mdmda you start to love everyone and everything. So on that  thought it theoreticly can be possible to be alone happy if you condition your brain to release these hormones without people arround you. Many buddhist do that trough deep meditation and thats their goal to achieve happiness trough being alone and only with them selfs because they believe that thats real happines because you dont rely on others to make you happy meaning you are not dependant on people to feel good about yourself wich can be good because friends / people come and go if you deppend on them to be happy you will never truly be. I think we all should learn to be alone and happy and get to know oureslvs first before we do with other people thats why a lot of buddhist take years of trips in the forest to find out who they are. It sounds cheesy but its true if you are constantly arround people you cant look at yorself and introspect because you are constantly distracted. But then again this could not be true and my ego can just be trying to make my self feel good about being alone. ", "subreddit": "ForeverAlone"}

I also hesitate about calling myself an FA because as you guys probably know, your thoughts become your reality (no offense to anyone at all).  That being said, what you guys say around here resonates with me on some level although I actively try not to wallow in depression although at times I do succumb.\n\n\nI am not calling myself attractive just because I think I am, but plenty of women smile at me all throughout the day, make themselves visible to me painfully obviously (i find it annoying actually), some find excuses to touch me, hang around my vicinity, get shy/giggle around me etc.. I'm tall, fit and muscular, and very talented.  The thing about this although I get so much female attention,  I still cannot seem to get women.  There are several reasons for this which I've noticed:  \n\n\n1. I'm extremely conscious and find nice personalities more attractive than looks (plenty of pretty women went from a 9 to a 0 to me for being ignorant and/or close-minded, entitled, non-understanding, annoying, judgmental, manipulative, etc. so i guess i'm just picky)  \n\n2. Cultural differences that other demographics wouldn't understand  \n\n3. I'm 30 years old with 6 roommates all younger than me in their early to mid 20's.  Every time I've told a girl about my living situation they've seemed to lose all attraction.  \n\n4. I'm pretty broke especially for my age and living in shallow &amp; materialistic LA doesn't help that  \n\n5. I am MGTOW and have an extremely low tolerance for women and their games  \n\n6. I do not want marriage or kids and it seems most women my age have already or want to settle down  \n\n7. I have a history of depression/quiet borderline personality disorder and am hypersensitive (although i never show it and hide my feelings until i implode due to social masculine norms hence the \"quiet\" in the term)  \n\n8. I have not really visible cuts on my forearms from cutting, but if you looked hard enough you might see them (i'm no longer paranoid about it, but it has never been received well from anyone.  I used to cut years ago but stopped due to it not being worth the social ostracism).  \n\n9. I can be social but am very introverted, but I have qualities that draw people to me (strong presence, social skills &amp; relatability, talented and handsome), but I hate being admired or worshipped (even heterosexual guys do this to me) which i find weird, because people can't see me for the person that I really am  with emotions and problems and shit.  All eyes are on me wherever i go and i just want to be alone and don't want the attention.    \n\n10. I get pegged as a player all the time although I'm not.  People always prejudge me and they're never right.  \n\n11. I know that it's a \"numbers game\" approaching women, but I've been rejected so many times that I just decided to not only stop, but actively and passively reject all female advances and attention because almost every time they've showed interest, I fucked it up somehow and it happens to be a perpetual cycle in my life, so I always have the upper hand rejecting them first.   \n\n12. I am extremely pessimistic about people in general due to my experiences.  \n\n\nI've pondered suicide many times in my life, but recently got in tune so much with music that it's just about the only thing that i'm living for now.  It kind of sucks, because now I feel like I \"HAVE to live\" just so i can experience the joy of making music, but I really wouldn't care if I died if it wasn't for that.  I've blocked out just about everyone in my life and am only working to support myself to make music.  Although it brings joy, I still experience the occasional fleeting feeling of sadness, despair, and loneliness to the point where I could cry, but I actively block it out and continue to create more music like I'm running away from my existence.  \n\n\nGod damn, I just came here to browse and ended up spilling an essay.  I'm sorry guys.  I hope you guys understand that this isn't a troll post and I seriously oscillate between suicidal feelings and hyper-motivation.  I don't seem to ever fit in fucking boxes, groups, or cliques that I have interest in because i'm always hated on due to jealousy because people only see my exterior but can't even comprehend the internal hell I deal with.\n\n&amp;#x200B;", "subreddit": "ForeverAlone"}

In this post: [https://www.reddit.com/r/ForeverAlone/comments/ab5n1z/welp\\_im\\_gonna\\_do\\_it/](https://www.reddit.com/r/ForeverAlone/comments/ab5n1z/welp_im_gonna_do_it/), I committed to said exercise, in addition to outlining some parameters. Because few bars are open, and few people attend bars, on weekdays, however, I have since amended the exercise; now aiming to speak to three women on Fridays, three on Saturdays and three on Sundays, for the four weekends of January, for a total of 36. The following post is not an account of a night spent doing such, but rather an account of a date I managed to secure.\n\nLast Tuesday, I went on a date with a woman I met at a Friday Meetup, which went well, and led to her agreeing to a second date. We had originally planned to do this the following Tuesday; however, I was going out to a restaurant tonight, and, on a whim, I decided to text her and ask if she'd like to come tonight instead, and she said yes. This date, likewise, went well. She seems to like me. I recommended a dish to her which she'd never had before but which she really liked. Also, when I noticed and pointed out a hair in it, the restaurant allowed her to eat for free - which was quite advantageous to her given that she's on a tight budget. So, two points for me! Afterwards, she proclaimed me her lucky charm, and agreed to a third date. This, folks, is the furthest I've ever got with a woman. And I got this far simply by making the choice to commit to this exercise, and enacting the simple steps outlined in my previous posts. I believe I've earned another 'success story' tag.\n\n**Tally:**\n\nGoal: 36.\n\nPoints: 22.\n\nBrownie points: 5.\n\nRejections: 0.\n\nPhone numbers: 4.\n\nDates: 3.\n\nAgain; ***polite***, ***constructive***, ***good faith*** suggestions are appreciated.", "subreddit": "ForeverAlone"}

After high school I became a freelance videographer, it was the one thing I was truly passionate about, making videos. I was just starting so I didn\u2019t have many clients..my family didn\u2019t really believe in me and were making it pretty clear I was a disappointment to them for not going to college. For a year it was a constant struggle between trying to make my business grow and proving my parents wrong, I constantly kept getting kicked out and had to spend A lot of time living at my sisters house, not to mention I had gotten a dog as a dream of mine that no one really wanted but I never gave up or lost hope. By this time all my other friends and classmates were about to graduate so I decided I\u2019ll give college a try to at least be able to start at the same time with my classmates. \nLong story short it was a really bad experience for me, I truly did try but college is just not a place for me so I dropped out of all my classes on the first semester. This time I came back and joined my dads business doing AC work, the arguing continued but at least I had a \u201creal\u201d job. \nI saved up enough money and before I knew it, I had enough money to move out, out of instinct I naturally moved out pretty fast. This happened pretty fast and almost unbelievable, I remember taking the day off work for my move in date, driving to my apartment closer towards the city with a car full of boxes and stuff sunny day playing \u201csend me on my way\u201d by rusted root. I thought about how I\u2019ll wake up and make eggs and drink orange juice while jamming out to music like I used to when my parents weren\u2019t home. I\u2019ve always had a lot of positive moments like this, it\u2019s what kept me going.  I remember thinking my home would be a safe place for me, my dog and all my friends, and for a moment I guess it was, it was definitely a new experience.\n\n It\u2019s now been a few months living here on my and the holidays have passed. \nI gotta say it\u2019s pretty different than I had imagined. I wake up every day pretty depressed and lonely, I feel like I\u2019ve isolated myself from everyone... I live on my own and go to work with the same guys, I can\u2019t really meet anyone new like I wish I could. I know some things have to change but I even started my freelance videography business again and business has been doing better than ever but if I\u2019m being honest it now seems like I\u2019m just grabbing for anything to spark up that joy I had, I find myself wanting to cry a lot but not being able to, there\u2019s days where it all suddenly comes out really hard and that usually feels really good. I\u2019m trying to get back into dating because I could use it, I haven\u2019t been in a real relationship after a tough breakup almost two years ago, but shit that gets harder as you get older, and anyone that\u2019s been on a dating app knows how much those are bullshit. Every time I get close to going on a date I get stood up or ghosted, now to be rude or anything but girls can be assholes sometimes especially to guys with big ass hearts. I want to try and meet new people but everyone that\u2019s \u201cout in the world\u201d are much older than me and anyone my age are either in school or idk doing their own thing. Imean I did it I moved out with my dog closer to the city, me and my parents relationship is better than it has ever been, I\u2019m growing with my dream job etc. but I\u2019m just not happy or satisfied. \nAnd I keep trying to fill that satisfaction and I know that\u2019s such a dangerous phrase to say, and I\u2019m just fucking scared. \nI\u2019m lost and I\u2019m scared and I\u2019m more alone than I have ever been in my entire life. \nI\u2019m learning, I\u2019m learning to appreciate. I\u2019ve always struggled with mental health my entire life but I\u2019ve always come out winning. Sure this is the hardest one I\u2019ve had to face, but I\u2019m learning. To appreciate my family more, to appreciate the present more, my youth, and to know that there\u2019s still plenty left in my life, I\u2019m scared that this age will affect my future in a negative way but I don\u2019t know I still have a lot to learn I guess I just wanted to get all of this off my chest, is this a normal thing in life?

I think they are more naturally able to get past things when they have the support system and more opportunities to do so.\n\nExample - I applied for, and got a job as a surveillance operator for a casino a few months ago. Long story short, I was fired because I wasn't at the level they needed. This as a disabled person who struggled with finding work bothered me longer than it may have had I the social network that supports me and provides with more opportunities. I would have brushed it off and maybe found a new job from a friend a week later instead of it being now February and being unemployed since August.\n\nI wouldn't focus so much on that other job because I would be doing a new one. I think for dating and rejection it's the same for normal people. Rejection haunts them less because they have more successes in life, and more opportunities. One girl says no on Friday, but another said yes on Saturday. Normal people just have a more balanced mind set from having a balance of good experiences with the bad ones. \n\nNormal people have problems, are rejected, etc but most of them have so many more opportunities, usually from their networks that they can use to balance it out.\n\nSomeone like myself who doesn't will be more depressed because we don't have the support system they do or the opportunities that come with having a good social network.

I don't have a group of friends I can hang out with, my hobbies consist of laying in bed watching youtube and occasionally playing video games. My family goes out and does things but I don't care to spend time with annoying siblings and berating parents. \n\nThe silence slowly degrades my mental capacity to do anything, and then the week starts over and I get the boost of energy to carry me through the week.

Don't worry about the physics of it all, just concentrate on the message.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFirst of all imagine you're a character, any species or whatever, and you have ONE other being (doesnt have to be a person but I'll refer to it as a person in my scenario) who you spend all of your time with, obsess over, love more than anything, and can't cope without - for some reason I imagine I'm a scottie dog with it's owner, not sure why. You spend years with this person and your life revolves around them.\n\nThen one day, this person is gone. Just like that. It was hard, it was upsetting, and you feel awful. You are put in a small, empty room. You have absolutely nothing now. You are crushed, heartbroken, and lonely. You go on like this for weeks, having nothing else to do you pine over them. You think about them every second of the day and become worse and worse.\n\nThen all of a sudden, you wake up to find something else in the room. A ball. At this point you are so miserable that you ignore the ball at first, but as the days go by, you decide you want to touch it. Then bounce it, then kick it. Things aren't much better, but you now have something small in your life. You think about how much your person would have enjoyed playing with the ball.\n\nThen one day you wake up and there's something else in the room - a paint set and canvas. You are reluctant at first, but you need something to do as the ball has became a little boring. And so you learn to paint, you try out all the colours, they never run out. And when you are done painting you play with the ball.\n\nThe next day you wake up and there's something else in the room - another person/being (I'm having another dog, a spaniel) you are very wary and don't want to interact with this other being. You stick to your painting, but as the loneliness takes over you give it a try. The other being is different, new, strange, and you decide you enjoy their company.\n\nOver the next few days new things start appearing in the room - music, toys, different food, and them one day, the room expands. You now have a small garden, and in that garden is another person/being. Seeds appear, small trees appear, You decide to start growing things in the garden together.\n\nAs time goes by, the garden grows bigger, you get another room and others join you. You don't necessarily like all of the others, some of them downright get on your nerves, but that's okay because you can go and paint and listen to music. You can go on walks, you get a swimming pool, these things start becoming small pieces of your ever growing life which is now much bigger and more full than it ever was.\n\nYou still think about that person from all those years ago. You still love them, that will never go away. But there is no limit to what you can do now. The rooms keep expanding, new people keep coming and going, and you have discovered many new talents. You have something to do every day now, and you have other people around you.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe moral is basically that the more new things you try, the more new people you meet, the less lonely and worthless you will feel. If you spend your lives thinking about the past, and do the same thing every day, nothing will change. The trick to overcoming heartbreak is to fill your days and try as many different things as possible - get off the internet, turn off the TV, get out of bed, and try your best to find as many enjoyable and rewarding things to do as you can.\n\n&amp;#x200B;", "subreddit": "lonely"}

I'm often told that I have really weird or odd tastes in girls and most of the people I've had relationships with or investment in are people who others call unattractive or unnoticeable. However, on the flip side, I am a two-sided person. \n\nOn the inside in my personal life (AKA everywhere outside school), I've been depressed since 3rd grade and considered an outcast up until the last two and a half years while my whole life I've pushed my parents away from me because they don't understand my mental problems evident by my sister also being depressed but they won't let her go to therapy or be treated, (the \"you're fine\" type of parents). As a result, I've grown up deceptive and secretive to my problems always **appearing** happy while pushing everyone away (from a personal and emotional standpoint at least) and feeling alone like no one has ever understood me. As for the cherry on top, for elementary school, I went to a private Catholic school and thus most of my natural behavior has been oppressed by the authorities around me causing me to be the rebellious outcast I mentioned earlier. \n\nWhile on the outside, I've always been an energetic loud-mouth extrovert who can't stop socializing with others. That may sound contradictory to what I previously said, but my whole life I have had personal life problems while seemingly not been able to stop socializing. It is important to note that this socializing is only limited to being friends who play video games and play at recess, there was nothing beyond that, no personal life talk or any signs of sadness shown. \n\nThis almost marks me as someone depressed whos also an extreme extrovert always filling the room as the loudest one. However, in recent years, I've become significantly more depressed despite being a successful person. This has caused me to amplify my extroverted side into becoming almost carefree and reckless. However, you might be able to see that that reckless and extroverted side of me literally repels those that I'm attracted to. As I previously mentioned I'm super attracted to kinda oddball, quirky, introverted, and smart people. But this fundamentally contradicts the personality I possess. While the fundamental way I interact with people is detached, low maintiance, and care-free, how can I have ANY chance with people that fundamentally think and look at the world differently?\n\nThat one introverted, smart, quirky but quiet girl mannerly sitting in the back listening to the lecture intently that barely talks with anyone in the class?\n\nTogether with the loud-mouth extroverted, vulgar, care-free, forthright guy that's always sitting with his chair backwards and ear-buds in his ear taking up all the room in the class?\n\n*Simply Unheard of*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnd to elaborate, I'd rather have a meaningful relationship than just some fling. That's why I've been off the saddle, its cause all the girls that are interested in me just annoy me or wanna have sex.\n\nThat brings me to the conclusion that I simply scare off the type of people I've been attracted to all my life, and I have no idea what to do about it. These two sides of me have been with me all my life.\n\nAnd to be completely honest, I really am not attracted at all to girls that are like my introverted side.\n\n \u00af\\\\\\_(\u30c4)\\_/\u00af  \u00af\\\\\\_(\u30c4)\\_/\u00af  \u00af\\\\\\_(\u30c4)\\_/\u00af  \u00af\\\\\\_(\u30c4)\\_/\u00af  \u00af\\\\\\_(\u30c4)\\_/\u00af  \u00af\\\\\\_(\u30c4)\\_/\u00af  \u00af\\\\\\_(\u30c4)\\_/\u00af  \u00af\\\\\\_(\u30c4)\\_/\u00af  \u00af\\\\\\_(\u30c4)\\_/\u00af  \u00af\\\\\\_(\u30c4)\\_/\u00af  \u00af\\\\\\_(\u30c4)\\_/\u00af  \u00af\\\\\\_(\u30c4)\\_/\u00af \n\nAnd to elaborate, I'd rather have a meaningful relationship than just some fling.

I can deal with all that Valentines Day crap. I don't know why I snapped. I just did. I'm just glad I was able to hide ironically in the Valentines Day crap. Only two coworkers saw me and they were supportive. \n\nThis sounds so dumb. I don't know why I lost it. This guy comes in and he has some kind of major disability. He's in his 20's but has a cane and has trouble talking. He is talking really loud to me but in a friendly way. His problem is something that was easily fixed and I was able to help. His girlfriend walked in. She seemed like she had a similar disability. Outside of that, she was conventionally attractive. He also seemed to have money by the way he was spending it. They left and I started thinking to myself, he didn't have to shower 20 times a day. He was below average looking and due to his disability couldn't fake being someone he wasn't but a woman found him attractive enough to get with. I know this is going to be taken wrong by a lot of people and downvoted but it wasn't anything against them. Honestly, I am happy for them. I told myself, people tell you to devote your entire life to improving yourself if you want to find someone but what about him? \n\nI was somewhat upset but nothing I couldn't handle. My coworker said I looked like I was sad. I said it was that guy. She said, yeah, that took a lot of patience to deal with him. I said, no, just the fact that he had a girlfriend...then I realized I was starting to bring my FA into work and quickly backed out saying I was just being stupid, it's okay. The problem is, she already knew what the problem was. Like I've said, most of my co-workers know I'm FA without me having to say it. She said, is it about...oh, you will find someone. When you are FA, sometimes your body language says more than you want to say. She is the religious type so she sad God has a plan, and I laughed saying the only plan he has for me is that it's just a prank bro. You know, his plan is actually just a prank. She said I believe it will happen for you. I said okay, lets move on so we did. \n\nI'm somewhat upset but I was able to get control of myself. A couple minutes later this couple walks in. They go to where the frozen food is, then start hugging. I can't help but stare. Then they start making out in front of me! I thought what the f*ck, right in front of me?!!? Since I was already on edge that was it for me. I felt the panic attack coming but wasn't able to make it to the bathroom. I just walked to the nearest place that people couldn't see easily which was the Valentines Day section, and put my head down next to a chocolate heart and started to freak out. I was able to avoid being loud but my coworker was wondering where I went and she saw me losing it. She said what's wrong, and I pointed in the direction of the couple. I said, it's all around me, rubbing it in. I realized I was next to a chocolate heart. I lost it not yelling but loudly whispering how my family is always getting on me about my being alone, and I can't take it anymore. \n\nThe good news was that she is one of my better coworkers and knew I couldn't go back up there. She got someone to cover and took me into a section she was working on. She gave me some signs and said you know what to do. Then talked me down. A few minutes later I was okay but her and another coworker had seen me with tears in my eyes over dumb things. \n\nI was able to finish my shift but I think my FA related depression is getting worse. This never happened to me. I was always in control of myself at work. I could be upset but not to the point I was unable to function. The good news also was that this happened late and there weren't many people around so it wasn't in front of other people. \n\nBeing FA can destroy you slowly but to the point that your ability to control yourself is slowly worn away. You are isolated outside of work for years. You have no friends. You have never had a significant other. You can only handle so much PDA until you can't handle it and let your emotions get the best of you. \n\nTL;DR Had a panic attack at work. It was stupid.", "subreddit": "ForeverAlone"}

Usually they are freaks both mentally, physically and socially.. The most offputting thing to me personally is these peoples sense of humor. But regardless.\n\nThis guy of course is completely oblivious to the fact he's never had a partner, at this point, judging by his behavioral disposition I don't think he ever even planned to, and by now he has no idea how this all even works. He is not aware of the existence of prime males of females, tinder, FA problems. You could say he is the greatest coper alive or just simply ignorant like a 5 year old. \n\nI am alarmed by the fact someone went 28-30 years without any awareness of this shit. I learned it in my first years of puberty. Given, he wouldn't be able to change his destiny if he found out now, or earlier but the fact he is living in bliss is so weird to me. He has been coddled for 28 years. It's bizarre and hilarious. And he doesn't really seem to be autistic, so I don't think that would be the explanation. ", "subreddit": "ForeverAlone"}

Rejection is not pleasant for anyone, but normies and attractive people can't truly believe, deep in their bones, that no one will ever be attracted to them. When we muster the nerve to try and subsequently fail, trying is much more complicated. We don't have the assets to succeed socially, at least in the traditional sense. It's much easier to believe, deep in our bones, that no one will ever be attracted to us. Each time we try and fail, we have to convince ourselves that there's a point to it all.\n\nWhether or not there's a point to us trying is subject to debate, but believing you're doomed to die alone is often worse than it actually being true. If you don't believe you're doomed to die alone, you will at least have hope. It may be a false hope, none of us can know for certain, but hope is always intermingled with uncertainty. None of us are prophets. Our lives are unpleasant, yes, but things could change. The only way to ensure otherwise is to do nothing. It may be inane advice, but we have to try.

I always associate interactions with pain, because I am always certain I'll say something stupid, will talk more than I should, or was too quiet.\n\nI feel ignored at the same time I feel like everybody is looking at me. So I have to keep myself in check, make sure every word sounds interesting or just doesn't sound dumb. When I try to express something I want to share, I just perceive the lack of reaction of everyone around and think to myself everybody heard it and there's something wrong with what I said, and since it always happens like this, therefore there's something intrinsically wrong in me, my existence is wrong, actually, everything I am is just worthless, nobody's ever going to like me, because there's nothing enjoyable in me.\n\nSo I just go on with this hopeless feeling of inadequacy, of not belonging, to a point where I give up. It's just too overwhelming for me, so I'd rather not say anything, not look at anybody, and stop showing up. I've been in my room since I dropped out of high school 2,5 years ago. Everytime I come in contact with anybody that knows me, it's all just blank, hollow, just a greeting and a false smile that's expressed to avoid being rude, and they do the same, just the socially mandatory, and then, nothing else. I can't let anybody in, there is something inside that I don't want people to see, I avoid closeness because of that. Somehow people notice it and are as cold towards me as I am to them.\n\nTruth is, I felt inferior my whole life, I don't think I deserve to be loved. I hate when I express something personal, because it's my essence being shown, and there's always a blowback inside my mind making me regret what I just did. I fact, I always regret each and every decision and action I remember I took in the past. Even if I chose differently, I would regret it, because the problem is not the actions, I am the problem.\n\nI don't know if it's my dad's fault for always showing disgust at everything I did and every predictable insignificant mistake, or my family ignoring me as a child while laughing during these large gatherings while I was alone, or being left aside by other kids during all my school life.

I wouldn't allow it to be read by anyone I know. If anyone does, I'm either dead or ------- snuck into my room and started snooping through my computer. I'm typing out of my \\*\\*\\* right now because I want this document to show my true feelings, and be able to reflect on it. It's my birthday today. Im 17. Woo. I feel like that new year's meme with squidward. It's no special event anymore. I woke up, played video games, ate cake, cried, played more video games, procrastinated homework, and will go back to sleep at some absurd time for a normal teenager with school at 7:45 the next morning. So, I wanna talk about my problems. I like to be organized so I'll do it one by one, describing each and how they make me feel. First, being fat. I've always been insecure about my weight, and its grown ever so apparent how much it affects my life now. I'm only in high school and the road ahead isn't looking too great. As with any other teenager or human being for that matter, I long for a relationship. I have a crush on this girl named -------, but somehow I know almost for certain she doesn\u2019t give a damn about me. Probably thinks I\u2019m some lonely, ugly, fat creep who\u2019s only \u201cfriends\u201d are the classmates who sit right next to him. And for the most part, she wouldn\u2019t be wrong. In the end, I can guarantee I\u2019m just not her type. It crushes me inside knowing that though. In my hopes of me being wrong or at least proving myself right, I\u2019m gonna let ----- know about this crush. Not directly, of course.  I could never bring myself to do that. He can\u2019t help himself. He\u2019ll tell her about it. Anyway, being fat doesn\u2019t just affect the non-existence of a dating life, it hinders everyday activities, brings death one step closer, and embarrasses me every chance it gets. I feel like I don\u2019t look right doing anything. Sitting down and walking too. I end up trying to ignore others and keep my head down. People, especially at work, pinch my man boob nipples as some sort of joke. Yea, real funny. P.E.? Forget it. I can\u2019t do half the activities in there. The least worrying thing to me is the health issues. I don\u2019t think I\u2019m quite obese enough for it to make a drastic difference, but I know it does. Problem numero dos: I\u2019m introverted as \\*\\*\\*\\* and I can\u2019t help but to stay silent most of the time. I am so anti-social the classmate that knew me the best thought I was asexual because of how monotone and boring I was\u2026 ouch. I feel like my parents don\u2019t know jack about me, and it\u2019s partially my fault. But they never bother to ask or look into the things I do tell them about. They simply don\u2019t care so I stopped telling them anything. What do you mean how was school? It was the same boring \\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\* \\*\\*\\*\\* as yesterday! What would you care anyway if -------- and some girl had a fight? You don\u2019t know them. I really despise those questions. The I-don\u2019t-actually-care-about-your-day-but-I-have-to-pretend-to kind of questions. Or a lot of the times when I\u2019m tired and people ask me really rhetorical questions I answer sarcastically. Probably shouldn\u2019t but they infuriate me. Problem three: What does the future hold? My grades have started slipping. I think it\u2019s a combination of my work getting harder and me starting to care less and less. I don\u2019t have a plan for when I get out of high school. Maybe I\u2019ll follow my dad and -------, it\u2019d be easier. Or I did take some interest in being an ATC. Literally everyone I\u2019ve talked to that has taken the test for it didn\u2019t make it though and I\u2019d have to move to Oklahoma for a month or two. I'm still not good at doing things on my own, my mom babied me for a long time. Suddenly she\u2019s like \u201cgo get some groceries\u201d but I\u2019m like I don\u2019t \\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\* know how to pay for \\*\\*\\*\\* and frankly I don\u2019t wanna be seen in public anyway. Back to occupations, what else interests me? Uhhh, Rubik\u2019s Cubes, aviation, computers. So let's knock em down one by one. There\u2019s no way to make a career out of solving cubes. The field of aviation is a lot more hard work than it is interesting. Computers is way too competitive of a field and it\u2019s too much education wise for something so iffy. So, where do I stand right now in my life? I feel lonely, I feel like I will end up getting a job I\u2019m miserable doing, and I\u2019ll never have the mental strength to overcome any obstacles including being fat and everything else.

I can count on one hand how many of my closest friends even acknowledged me today.  Everyone that I've grown up with, been friends with for 10 years, they didn't say anything.

I originally regarded this as just another date, one that wouldn't require either of us to spend any money, and that no, I wouldn't be attempting to make a move on her, since it was still too early for that. But because I mentioned that it was in fact her who suggested this, which most respondents interpreted as an indicator of interest, most respondents argued that I should, in fact, try to make a move on her after all.\n\nSo, look, alright then... perhaps I'll give it a go. Thing is, this is the first time in my life I've ever had a woman over, so I don't really know what to do in this regard. So, if anyone *does* have any experience in this arena, feel free to give me some pointers. Please be mindful of the fact that this is the #MeToo era, which means I want to be really, *really* careful about not doing anything she isn't comfortable with, especially since, the fact that she asked to come here notwithstanding, the third date *does* still seem pretty early to me. Furthermore, she's Korean, so I can't rule out possible cultural differences. I'll only do anything anyone suggests if I, personally, think it sounds reasonable, and if anyone gives me any suggestions which sound explicitly creepy to me, I'm blocking them immediately.\n\n:EDIT: Okay, since lots of people seem to be encouraging me to put my arm around her and see if she's receptive, and that doesn't seem too unreasonable to me (if she pulls away, I can just desist and say: \"sorry\" immediately), that's what I'm going to try.", "subreddit": "ForeverAlone"}

{"post_id": "apgfb3", "created_utc": 1549892883, "title": "38 years old. My personal story.", "author": "Pennyinthebox", "self_text": "My apologies for the ramblings of a fool but my chest weighs heavy with old and new pain and this stupid loneliness I have brought upon myself and inability to engage in normal conversations makes it harder for me to talk about it with others close or far from me. That is why I want to write it all down, this beautiful nonsense I call my life. I am not well versed in the English language thus my sincere apologies again.\n\nI was born in 1980 in a small town in the Netherlands and my youth was filled with joy, parental love and happiness. We had not much but my father provided enough so that he, my mother, me and my older brother could live a simple, happy life. Those days are far behind me and I cherish those memories of old times. The time I was sitting on my nieces\u2019 her lap singing songs and when she stopped singing she would spread her knees apart so that I fell on the floor, laughing. When I did the groceries with my mother I put one candy in my pocket. I had to apologise to the shopkeeper in person when my mother found out. There were many painful memories as well. But you have to take the sweet with the sour. The sour in those days I do remember but never bother me in my old age. Parents fighting, brother teasing, dog biting, car running me over, almost drowning.\nThe usual kids stuff.\n\nWhen I turned 13 or fourteen I started to asking questions someone of my age or any age of that matter must never ask but we all start asking anyway. Do I matter? Am I the best in anything? I forgot one variable in those days and I was in my late twenties when I understood my error. In my youth I believed that I was not on top of anything. I was and am not the fastest, never the smartest nor prettiest. I was never a good kisser nor the most romantic boyfriend. In everything I could not find anything I was the top of the class of.\nI also thought that if someone loved another the other had to be the best in something. He is the cutest, she is the cuddliest, he is the strongest. How foolish I was to believe that because I am not the best in anything It is useless to search for love for to find love you must be the best in something.\nIf you, dear reader, want to learn one lesson from an old idiot Please learn this. A star shines when someone tells it shines. If someone tells you that you are the best kisser then you are the best kisser. And to find the one who tells you you are the best in something accept every heart that is given to you and feel love and be heartbroken many times. It is necessary to live. \n\nIn my twenties I have closed my heart for any love. Yes, I had some one-night pleasures but not love. Even had a moment when I started caring for a young woman but never accepted her love and thus losing her. Even today I miss her but alas she is gone. From that moment on I doubted my rigid believe. But the damage was already done. I doubted myself, I doubted my abilities, I had trouble engaging in any conversation to express myself. I was gaining the believe that I could find love but lost confidence that I would ever find it.\n\nNow I am 38 years old. Life has been kind and hard on me. The normal things a life will throw at you and you have to deal with.\nI am a math teacher on a private school. I do not think I am a good teacher but I am adequate though. I know my students will forget me when they leave school. I am not that special or important. \nI care alot for my students and their wellbeing. I believe if you want to succeed your mind and heart have to be clear. A teacher has to work hard on those things. I listen to their grievings, their problems, their dreams, their joy.Then I try to teach them the math as good as I can. I try to learn them How to solve math problems by first exploring the problem, finding a plan to solve the problem and reflecting every step on the way. No manager or fellow worker is interested in What I do. They have their own work to do and problems to solve.  It is stressfull work but fullfilling.\nMy mood swings like a pendulum. Happy and angry. I fear students starts to hate my lessons or even me.\n\nA few years ago because of my brothers\u2019 su\u00efcide I again was confronted How important love is for he had none and could not vent his emotions. Burnout from work, doubt about the future and selfloathing Made him hang himself. Mind you, his passing never weighed heavy on my chest. I do not mourn for the dead. I cherish his memories that are close to my heart. I am not putting my head in the sand for I understand He has passed away. At the end we will all die.\nAnd like My father always says: do not wait and pray for heaven you must work hard to make heaven here on earth. And at the end when you look back you can die happy.\nI thought my home was heaven. Enough boardgames and computer games to enjoy for a lifetime. Music fills a warm and cosy living room. The scent of a well prepared meal like the Indonesian RengDang or Indian curries hangs in the air.\nNow I notice:\nWhen I bought my games they had te be played solitair.\nWhen I play music it is to drown out the silene.\nWhen I cook it is to eat my troubles away.\nNow I notice how lonely I am.\n\nAnd I want to change, I need to change for the sake of my own wellbeing. I want to meet others who understand this feeling because I know I am not alone in this. And maybe, maybe, maybe I will find that what I thought never would get.\nOne may dream of golden mountains but I want to search for them but I have no clue where to begin.\n\nWith much love,\nMe\n", "subreddit": "lonely"}

A dirty old thing it was, barely managing to keep up with the chaotic rhythm of uptown traffic. It reeks of age, a stale smell that still stings, no matter how much you'd hoped you'd gotten used to it. And yet somehow I like that bus more than I'd care to admit. The doors hang open slightly, letting cool air in during hot summer days. Water has leaked between the two panes of windows, creating a makeshift aquarium - the mesmerizing shapes the water takes as the bus rumbles along uneven roads, the algae that's slowly creeping up the sides of the window giving it a vibrant green tint. The seats, dusty and matted from years of use, but as comfortable as your grandmother's gaudy old couch with most of its springs missing. Stickers and pins, some more than twice my age, adorn the driver's side of the bus. The regatta of 89, a simplistic shape of an ice cream cone that's no doubt a cut-out from an old magazine, a large ''Welcome!'' sign with its corners torn off and edges scratched. And sometimes, I even miss the smell.\n\nIt's like an old friend now. The years you spent together, going from place to place, seeing all sorts of things, through thick and thin. But from afar you can see that they're struggling. Their stride falls shorter, their voice coarsens, and every once in a while a rogue cough escapes their lips, no matter how hard they try to hide it. And you know that it won't be long now. Before something happens. I frown a bit, as I see it leave the station, sputtering and grumbling all the way. To feel this way about a bus seems a bit weird, I admit. But that's alright. \n\nI decide to rest a little on the station bench. A rare quiet moment creeps up on the otherwise fairly busy bus stop. Some passers by quickly walk along, paying no attention to me, or anything else for that matter, stuck deep in their own thoughts. A couple of pidgeons strut about, making their way to who knows where to do who knows what. A particular spot of ground seems to be cozy enough for them to stay put - the shade of the bench, sheltered from the ongoing rain. They preen their feathers for a while, giving me the chance to appreciate how pretty they look. One, brown all over, dappled with spots of darker brown and beige. The other, a mixture of deeper and lighter grays with a wonderful dim purple collar. And their eyes shining bright orange, like looking at a fading speck of flame. I freeze as I hear a sound I haven't heard in far too long. \n\nA pidgeon's coo. \n\nSuch a simple thing, really. But even simple things can be profound in their own way. When I was little, every single day I'd use to wait for the bus at a nearby park. Though calling it a park would be exaggerating a bit. A yellowing patch of grass with a few raggedy chestnut trees. It was usual for flocks of pigeons to waddle around, combing the area for something to eat. I loved listening them coo and ruffle their feathers, watching them keenly as they made their way from one end of the park to the other. I used to stand under an old chestnut tree to wait for them to land, sometimes even missing the bus. I learned to think of them as friends. And they were always there, without fail. A constant in my life, like true friends are.\n\nAs usual though, you begin to change, to forget. And so I did. Years went by. The commute stayed the same. Rather than the pigeons who brought with them a sense of calm after a long and hectic day, I chose to stare blankly at nothing, turning off the outside world and falling into a deep haze of daydreams - or more commonly - dull, empty thoughts.\n\nNow, hearing these two pidgeons cooing sweet nothings at each-other made me remember. Another old friend come to visit. For a second, I felt like I was back there, under that very same chestnut tree. For a second, I felt like a kid again. For a second, I felt loved. A feeling so unbearably foreign.\n\nI take a look at my watch out of habit, not really caring if time goes by or not. Happy. I feel happy.\n\nMaybe I'll stay here a while longer.", "subreddit": "lonely"}

Don't care if you're a dude though, maybe you can still relate in some way.\n\nPersonally I was made to feel extremely ugly and fat by my mother as a teenager. Most of our relationship revolved around my not so impressive dress sense and mannish features. Sometimes she'd make a light-hearted joke about my \"tuna thighs\" or \"giant forehead\" and other times if she was in a bad mood due to her crappy marriage it'd be a lot more vicious. I deeply resented the fact everything seemed to be about looks and image to her, so I'd often rebel and wear ugly things to piss her off. I usually had very little say in how I dressed. I think in her twisted mind she was trying to protect me from humiliation and boost my chances of finding a boyfriend I guess? She was overweight growing up and bullied back in highschool.\n\nI started to withdraw into video games by 14 and just cut myself off from friends. I kinda just started hating people. It was either I had to pretend to like karaoke, shopping or dramas or be alone at lunch breaks. I was also always the ugliest one of our group and felt ignored. I ended up finding a new social circle which was great for a while and had more things in common, but just the act of hanging out and socialising proved too draining for me and they ended up cutting me off after highschool.\n\nWhen I was 16 I overheard a cousin I looked up to talking to her friend about how she agreed I was extremely ugly, but everybody kept saying I was pretty to make me feel better. The funny part was I walked right into her line of sight at the \"right\" time and her face went so pale I was sure she'd pass out.

In this post: [https://www.reddit.com/r/ForeverAlone/comments/ab5n1z/welp\\_im\\_gonna\\_do\\_it/](https://www.reddit.com/r/ForeverAlone/comments/ab5n1z/welp_im_gonna_do_it/), I committed to said exercise, in addition to outlining some parameters. Because few bars are open, and few people attend bars, on weekdays, however, I have since amended the exercise; now aiming to speak to three women on Fridays, three on Saturdays and three on Sundays, for the four weekends of January, for a total of 36. The following post is not an account of a night spent doing such, but rather an account of a date I managed to secure.\n\nThis time, the woman ventured to my apartment. I picked her up from the train station and walked back with her, during which I asked if I could hold her hand, to which she said yes (good sign one). Once we got there, I made us some spaghetti pesto, a dish which she'd never had (she's Korean) but which she liked (point one for me), and put a movie on. Based on advice I solicited in this post: [https://www.reddit.com/r/ForeverAlone/comments/apf0pk/since\\_most\\_people\\_seem\\_to\\_be\\_encouraging\\_me\\_to/](https://www.reddit.com/r/ForeverAlone/comments/apf0pk/since_most_people_seem_to_be_encouraging_me_to/), I asked her if I could put my arm cuddle her, and again, she said yes (good sign two). For dessert, I presented her with a Flake I'd bought for her (earlier, she'd mentioned this was her favorite candy), and she, delighted, hugged me (good sign three). We resumed watching the movie, and I eventually asked if I could kiss her. For the third time, she said yes, so I did, and then we started tonguing, took each other's clothes off, went to the bedroom, and, well, the rest is history. After it was over, we took a shower together, and once it was time for her to go home, I asked her if we were officially a couple now, and she said yes. She departed with another hug and a kiss.\n\nSo... yeah. No, really.\n\nThe first thing I want to make clear is that this was *not* some life-changing experience. At least not for me. For starters, unpaid sex didn't feel any different, either physically or emotionally, from paid sex. It was actually, in some respects, more stressful, given that I was obliged to pay a bit of heed to her own pleasure rather than just lie back and wait for the prostitute to get me off. Whatsmore, even after having unpaid sex and a girlfriend now, I'm still exactly the same person I was before. I still possess exactly the same personality; the exact same interests, goals, desires and worries. I spent the rest of the day doing exactly the same things I did during my days prior to this. I am not brimming with happiness or confidence or anything now. Neither having unpaid sex nor a girlfriend now is honestly really that big of a deal at all \u2013 less a jump for joy than a shrug of indifference. I can only speak for myself, not for anyone else, but understand that if you are expecting either of these things to change your life, they might not necessarily do so.\n\nBut that aside; well, folks, what can I say? Last December, I decided, as an experiment, to try going out every weekend, speak to at least one woman each night, and see what happened. I didn't expect to get anything out of it other than maybe a handful of phone numbers \u2013 certainly not sex or a relationship. And a few people here cautioned me against doing so at all. Nevertheless, though, I committed to doing it, and have doggedly stuck to it to this date. And what I've discovered in doing so is that talking to women, getting women's numbers, getting dates, and getting sex and a relationship is *actually completely fucking easy*.\n\nI've said it once, I've said a million times, but I am average looking, possess average social skills, and am not rich. Nevertheless, though, I have gained everything I have gotten out of this simply by joining a bar-crawling Meetup, signing up to attend some sessions, venturing to those sessions, sitting down next to women, talking to them about banal shit for 15 \u2013 30 minutes each, and asking them for their numbers at the end. It really was/is that uncomplicated. At no point during this exercise have I experienced the slightest bit of pain or difficulty. I didn't need to spend much money. I didn't need to approach hundreds of women. I didn't need to read any Pickup Artist books, watch any Pickup Artist videos, or attend any Pickup Artist camp; I didn't need to know or execute any fancy-schmancy parlor tricks or convoluted strategies. Not one of the women has been cold or rude. Hell, I've never even explicitly been rejected. And yet, as effortless as it was, here I am. Yes, maybe I've simply gotten lucky or am simply naturally good at this, but I honestly think that the more likely explanation is that this is all simply much easier than many men assume it to be. If you, likewise, are average looking and possess average social skills, I see no reason why you, likewise, shouldn't be able to get as far as I have simply by doing the same things I have done, and I really would recommend at least trying it.\n\nLastly; I'd like to clarify something. In light of these events, I really can't be considered FA in any sense anymore. I was never really FA in the first place, given that I'd never particularly wanted sex or a romantic relationship, and had never really had any difficutly talking to women. Now, however, I can't be considered FA even peripherally, so I would like to know whether people here would still like me to continue posting here? Even in light of these events, I still intend to complete my exercise; still intend to go out and talk to women each weeked until I've reached my goal of 36, just for contingency's sake. However, I don't have to post accounts of my nights spent doing so if nobody wants me to, especially since I likely won't have anything notable to report from now on.\n\n**Tally:**\n\nGoal: 36.\n\nPoints: 23.\n\nBrownie points: 5.\n\nRejections: 0.\n\nPhone numbers: 4.\n\nDates: 4.\n\nSex: 1.\n\nRelationships: 1.\n\nAgain; ***polite***, ***constructive***, ***good faith*** suggestions are appreciated.", "subreddit": "ForeverAlone"}

I feel like I don't know how to do anything. I've forgotten how to introduce myself to new people, how to create connections and nourish them into something that lasts. This weakness has put me in a pretty bad place, as I've lost a lot of people recently. \n\nMy best friend of 11 years betrayed and abandoned me. My other friends no longer have any respect for me. My father never wants to see me again. I have a reputation all around town as a degenerate subhuman. My most recent girlfriend dumped me and disappeared just when I was starting to be happy. \n\nI don't feel like I can go out and meet a new girl - this one just fell into my lap against all odds, after my attempts to get back my previous ex had left me damaged and vulnerable. As soon as this girl was gone, I found myself running back to the previous ex again, a woman I loved with all my heart for more than two years.\n\nI still love her. Sometimes I was a bad boyfriend, and I didn't know how to express what I needed from a relationship, so I would get depressed until I told her I wanted to break up. That was my horrible way of getting her to pay attention to what I needed. I never really wanted to leave her, I just wanted to feel like I was important to her, and it seemed like she often didn't care to make me feel important. But I always wanted her back. We always kept seeing each other after we were broken up, and we always got back together.\n\nUntil one day we didn't. While we were not officially together, she met someone else, and she stopped saying \"I love you.\"\n\nNot long after that, she stopped spending time with me.\n\nThen she told me she had found that new person, and that she was moving on from me. I couldn't breathe.\n\nI still can't. Every morning that I wake up, totally alone in the world, I reach to her side of the bed and I panic when I realize there's nobody there. That she isn't there.\n\nThe other guy has since left her, and he isn't coming back. But she still doesn't want me. She doesn't love me any more. And I... I just can't believe it. I can't take it for an answer. I'm at a point where I don't like anything about me, and I feel like I have no value if I don't have someone to love me. I feel like if I can't get her, someone who loved me for years, to love me again, how can I ever expect anyone else to? She still talks to me, tries to be a friend to me. Ironic, considering that part of the reason I kept being a shitty asshole to her was that she was rarely a friend to me back then.\n\nHer trying to be nice only makes me more certain that there must be a part of her, buried in there, that wants me back. But she doesn't. She's made it clear, over and over again, that she doesn't. And she never will. She finds my attempts to win her over, to remind her of the reasons she fell in love with me in the first place, pathetic and annoying - even though she won't use those words. \n\nToday she finally said to me, after some prompting, that she does still think I'm a good person. She still thinks I deserve to be loved. She still thinks I have earned the right to be loved. She won't be the one to do it, and no matter how she explains it I just can't understand why. Still, though, her opinion means more to me than anyone else's. I've been told by tons of people that I'm still a good person and that I still deserve to be loved, but I never believed it. Hearing it from her, though, I almost believe it.\n\nI can't understand why I can't move on. I don't *want* to be hung up on someone who doesn't want me back. There's a part of me, deep in my heart, that screams at me day in and day out that real love will conquer absolutely anything. That if there's any chance at all of her ever loving me again, in a long enough timeframe it's a certainty. That if I just give her enough of me, one day she will be ready to give back. I know that this is insane. I know it's unhinged, I know it's delusional, I know that she's never coming back. But my emotions rule my logic 100% of the time, and I can't make myself look for someone else because I can't let go of her.\n\nI've been told I shouldn't look for someone else, that if I just live my best life someone will come along and stumble into it. But I haven't been living my best life in a long, long time. I'm broken. She broke me. I was supposed to be a great man with a bright future, and all that is going to go to waste because she broke me. ", "subreddit": "lonely"}

Ironically, people who dislike their jobs tend to judge unemployed people. I have a job that I don't care for, so i rarely go and I understand what it's like not wanting to work. The whole thing is fucked; work 5 days a week until retirement when you're 60, but of course by then you're too old to truly enjoy your money and you don't even know how to relax because your whole life has been focus on work. That's why so many older people who retire get depressed or go back to working. Fortunately I came to realize that money can't make me happy early in my life so this saved a lot of time people waste chasing money.\n\nThe way I see it is you didn't choose to be born, so you should at least be allowed to live your life however you want to. People tend to judge you if you're unemployed because they're unhappy, and judging makes them feel a little better about themselves. But somehow working a job you dislike for the most part of your life is considered normal. We've been conditioned to think and say things like \"work isn't supposed to be fun\" but why not?. They say \"everyone else does it\", but does that make it less crazy?\n\nI say do whatever it is you enjoy (unless you enjoy killing people or something). I myself enjoy meditating, reading, watching tv and [making music](https://soundcloud.com/remedy97/understand), so I spend most of my time doing that. Although my passion is music, I'm not sure i'll get far with it. Although a year ago I made [this album](https://breaze.bandcamp.com/album/the-art-of-being-nobody) and although it was free, I made some money off it which was cool and really surprising. So I definitely recommend also finding a creative hobby if you have a lot of free time.\n\nOn top of all this though, I highly recommend taking some time out of your day to just *be*. No phone, no tv, no distractions. Just spending some time observing your own thoughts. We're always doing, so it's good to take some time off and just do nothing (literally). We're called human *beings* after all, not human *doings*.\n", "subreddit": "ForeverAlone"}

And quite frankly, with all of that information and observations, my result comes to: Fuck if I know because it's completely unpredictable.\n\nFor example, I never really ever figured out what made me FA. I'm rather average-looking, if a bit different because of my mixed ethnicity. I'm overweight but it's not so severe that I can't fit in one airplane seat or in a regular sized chair; most people tend to think I'm a lot lighter than I actually am because my torso is small but I have big legs. I like to think that I'm not stupid and am somewhat successful since I have my MET diploma with aerospace experience and academic research as my background. But I was still FA for a reasonably long time (until 25, almost 26).\n\nSame goes for other people I know. One of my best friends was described as looking \"like a model for a high-end French store\" when I showed somebody the pictures from her test shoot. And she's also highly educated with multiple languages and a degree in Classics. Yet she's only ever been on 3 dates in her entire life, two of which I actually set her up on.\n\nAs for the guys, it's even more ridiculously murky. I've known a lot of guys, tall, short, whatever. One of the smartest guys I know is very engaging and social with lots of friends, is rather tall (dude towers over me), has money, and is physically rather good looking. Yet he's *never* been on a date in his entire life.\n\nAnd yet, on the opposite side of the playing field, there's people that I'm baffled by that have and had plenty of relationships.\n\nFor example, a few days ago, I was talking to the girlfriend of somebody in my bf's friend group and she was going on about how it was strange to meet her boyfriend's friends because she always used to just share friend groups with her previous exes. And I couldn't relate to the topic at all because I never dated anyone until now.\n\nAnd maybe it sounds like I'm being judgemental but this girl is...really not that attractive from any point of view. From a physical point of view, she's neither slim or cute; she's actually quite a lot bigger than I am, easily 30lbs heavier than me or more. She's not especially brilliant even though she is a teacher and she's mean as all get out. I watched her literally smash a board into her boyfriend's head because \"He made me upset!\" What the hell? Yet the guy she's dating is making about 2x-3x the amount she's making at his job, objectively isn't bad looking at all (average face but fit), and is a genuinely nice guy.\n\nHow does somebody as physically and mentally unattractive as that find a boyfriend so easily, never mind the multiple guys she's dated? How are people in this sub who are quite fit (iirc a lot of guys work out here), have decent jobs, seem like decent and kind people, et cetera unable to find somebody to be with? Why is there such a huge discrepancy between what people want, what people have, and what people date? Is it mental? Physical? Sociological? Financial? It all seems so unpredictable to me.\n\nWhat's everyone else's thoughts and theories on this?", "subreddit": "ForeverAlone"}

Any help?", "author": "scaphrax", "self_text": " \n\nHey guys, so as the title mentioned, I lost my best friend since last year October. I had known him for a good **10 years**. Straight to how it happened - will try to keep it as short as possible, the final tipping point for him (I'm saying this cus I think something was building up from his end which I don't clearly know what did till this day) was over a **video game.....yes....pixels on a screen**. It was specifically player unknown battlegrounds. Anyway, what happened was basically i was coming back late to my uni campus at night after watching a movie, he called me up and asked if he wanted me to join him and his inexperienced friend of the game in about 10 min. I agreed. Then another group of my uni friends had asked me to join in on their squad match as well (same game), I agreed intentionally thinking that they're better so \"the chances of winning is higher\". Anyway joined their session WITHOUT TELLING my friend. He straight away got really pissed off and upset towards me. I don't clearly remember apologising to him afterwards which I know and am aware I should've if I did consider him as my best friend. But I didn't...I remember i kept on telling myself,\"wait, its not as if I intentionally chose to not pick him up from a train station while its snowing up somewhere it flippin Scotland and I'm all the way back in Wales.... this was an online video game from christs sake\"\n\nAnyway, uni work caught up with me \\*hard\\* - i was a 2nd year pharmacy student back when this had happened. Massive jump in difficulty and demand, and a lot of other group projects. I always did have calling him to check up on how he's doing in the back of my mind leading to December - I specifically remember I promised to call him on the 8th of December to catch up (without telling him). Bear in mind, I decided now to not call him at all for like a whole month and a half from practically calling each other every day or at least every other day (we were close). So the date came, last lecture of the term....and I called his number. Time jumping ahead, didn't pick up any of my many calls, didn't reply to any of my messages via all the possible online messaging applications you could think of - I even tried contacting his little sister via facebook, begging her to ask my friend to contact me to ask the reasoning of all of this. She read it, no reply from her whatsoever, which is understandable. I hit rock bottom hard (fyi guys, I try my best not to use the term depression too much....I personally feel like there are too many people - especially university students who tends to overuse that word without actually knowing what true depression is) throughout the second term of my 2nd year at uni. Its literally a **FLIPPIN MIRACLE** that I have somehow passed all my exams first time round and now in 3rd year. He was someone that I could always talk to whenever I felt like it - I had dark experiences in my life, ranging from failing uni at two different unis twice and also having to observe domestic abuse between my parents. Whenever I felt upset from these moments, I called him - and just talking to a genuine friend who knew you is much different to talking to some volunteer over the phone aka the samaritans (yes-i've tried...).\n\nNow I have no friends.....you could say I have friendly acquaintances in my course....but none of them I can tell and predict gonna lose contact to anyway after we graduate (well, hopefully I do graduate). But yeah, they're the ones that I know for sure that will occur like this,\n\n\"Oh yeah, promise to keep in touch yeah!!! Pharmacy squad 2k20 FTW! Lets defo meet up sometime\"\n\nTurns out we don't.\n\n**But on the other hand...I feel like ever since losing my best friend, I've turned into a right pessimistic prick in life, a massive negative outlook on forming friendships and other stuff in general. I think that's why I feel so depressed right now. In other words, I think I don't try to bother putting in the time and effort to the opposite person - cus I have this thought of \"whats the point, you're never gonna be as close to me as my other friend.\" or \"you've got middle/ high school friends, I don't\" or \"you've got a girlfriend, you always say,'oh yeah, i need to hang up now man, gonna go visit my girl down the road, or my girls coming over'\". You could say jealousy is another big factor....fyi, I've had a rough experience in asking out girls and never had one in my life.**\n\nBut on my defence, I know myself for sure that the guys I know, I don't truly click with them....truly I don't. I have tried to have a more positive outlook, but honestly I can tell they're not nice friends for me - bear in my I am not saying they are bad people in any manner or form, they are a nice bunch of friends that any normal person could have, but in terms of feeling like they're guys that i will truly want to get close to, the answers no.\n\n**A little thing about me guys - which may make you all go,\" ohhhhhhh, no wonder I'm so antisocial\", I'm basically a combination of an otaku and a weaboo combined. To normal people language, I frickin love video games and love watching Japanese anime (cartoons). I have tried to seek \"like minded people\" by joining the typical university societies for these hobbies, but when I did go, call me a hypocrite idc...but it was full of people that was lets say too into it. I don't know how to word it, like I'd prefer to sometimes talk about other stuff and not just those things when I go to those kind of gatherings. I prefer to do these kind of things privately in my room.**\n\nI also have an older sister who's married, and she always tells me,\"try to appreciate your own company more\" which I get, but its hard to do that when you lost someone that made me to who I am today - a massive part of my life just gone in an instant.\n\nAnyway, what's your suggestion? I'd appreciate it if I don't receive advice like,\"god will look after you dont worry\" or even the typical \"Friends come and go man, chin up\".\n\n\\[Edit\\] Addressing what i said earlier about giving up in making friends - I am aware guys that forming friends takes **time, even more so for best friends. I am aware i am being impatient.**", "subreddit": "ForeverAlone"}

{"post_id": "aq0gi9", "created_utc": 1550017954, "title": "Folks, can I please clarify a few things about my posts?", "author": "fastzander", "self_text": "I suspect that I will get downvoted for this, but I want to make a few points clear.\n\n1. I acknowledge that I am white, middle class, average-looking as opposed to ugly, do not actually possess any social anxiety or experience any difficulty talking to women, and am currently living on my parents' dime. I acknowledge that these facets afford me privileges and advantages that other people, including other people on this subreddit, do not possess. However, I have always acknowledged this. I outlined my personal circumstances in the first post I ever wrote on this subreddit, and have linked to that post in the first paragraph of every account I have posted here since then. I have never made any secret of any facets that might have afforded me advantages. And that aside, I honestly think that the overwhelming majority of any success I have had can ultimately be attributed to the fact that I simply made the conscious choice to try something new, get off my ass, put myself out there and talk to women.\n2. I acknowledge that a person in circumstances different to myself might not experience the same results that I have from doing the same things that I did, or even be capable of doing the same things that I did in the first place. I acknowledge that just because I have found talking to women, getting phone numbers, getting dates, and getting sex and a relationship to be easy, does not necessarily mean that anyone else, especially someone in different circumstances to myself, will likewise find these things to be easy. Again, however, I have always acknowledged this. I have never *promised* that doing the same things I have done will yield the same results that I have gotten, and I certainly do not hold anything against someone who has tried to do the same things I have done and not gotten the same results that I have. On the contrary, I sympathize with them.\n3. The purpose of my accounts is not to brag about my successes. The purpose of them is merely to inform people of which events actually happened to transpire. If I recount my successes, this is merely because I have, in fact, succeeded. If I state that I have found talking to women to be easy, this is merely because I have, in fact, found talking to women to be easy. If, on the other hand, I found talking women to be difficult, then I would state that I found talking to women to be difficult instead. I am simply being honest. And again, I do not claim to speak for anyone except myself. If I succeed, and I report this, and this makes either myself seem smug or anyone who reads it feel bad, then I am sorry, but such is not my intention. That's on them.\n4. What I *do* hope my accounts will do is inspire other men *in similar circumstances to myself*, and whom *haven't tried the same things I have*, to try them themselves, because then they, too, *might* experience the same results that I have.\n5. I really, truly, honestly am merely average looking as opposed to attractive. Please, I beg of you to take my word for this. I am under six feet. I am skinny. I have sideburns. I have yellow, uneven teeth. I do not possess broad shoulders or a strong jawline or dreamy eyes or any shit like that. The only way I could prove this to you is by posting an uncensored photograph of myself, which I am not comfortable doing, but is this really something that is so hard to believe?\n6. I discourage negativist responses to my posts because, more often that not, I find that they accuse me of one of the points I have debunked above, and I find this irritating. Also, because I find them to be petulant and unproductive in general. And I really do not believe that this is altogether unreasonable of me. I acknowledge the need of some people on here to vent sometimes, but there are plenty of negativist threads on this subreddit, and I would prefer for mine to be some rare positivist ones. Please, either offer me a constructive suggestion or make a vow to try something yourself, or just don't say anything. If you want to sulk, there are other places here you can do it.\n7.

In my next post ([https://www.reddit.com/r/ForeverAlone/comments/ab5n1z/welp\\_im\\_gonna\\_do\\_it/](https://www.reddit.com/r/ForeverAlone/comments/ab5n1z/welp_im_gonna_do_it/)), I committed to said exercise. Since then, each weekend, as promised, I have gone out, spoken to women, and thereafter posted accounts detailing my experiences doing so. And ultimately, against all my expectations, yesterday, this exercise resulted in me both experiencing unpaid sex for the first time, and acquiring a girlfriend for the first time, in the form of a woman I met during one of my nights out.\n\nFor the most part, the commenter base here has thus far been supportive of my endeavor. Unfortunately, the response of many people on this sub to the aforementioned development, while initially congratulatory, has, in the span of only a few hours, turned quite ugly. I have detected a very stark, sharp, sudden shift away from support for me and towards hostility against me since then. My posts have been flooded with accusations that I am gloating, or offering unfeasible advice, which I have been struggling to refute, and there has even been a smattering of racism. And I now believe, alas, that much of this is attributable to jealousy - that people are upset that I have succeeded where they have failed, or have been too nervous to try.\n\nIn light of these events, I have decided to stop posting on this subreddit. Indeed, perhaps this is appropriate, given that I am no longer in any way classifiable as part of its target demographic. While I still intend to complete my exercise - going out each weekend and talking to women until I have reached my goal of 36, just for contingency's sake - I will not be posting accounts of myself doing so anymore.\n\nI anticipate more downvotes for this, but this, folks, is not the correct way to respond when somebody here manages to \"escape\". The correct way to respond is to be happy for them, before considering how they succeeded and whether you might replicate what they did in order to succeed yourself - not to get all pissy and start levying baseless accusations against them until you chase them off.\n\nIn case anyone wants it, a complete list of links to each of my posts, in chronological order, is as follows:\n\n1.

It sounds literally insane typing out that sentence, but the freedom and quietness I experience makes me so happy every once in awhile. I see people so caught up and anxious about society and being left out and what not, but due to my loneliness over the years I\u2019ve actually learned to become more independent and completely fine with utter silence for days at a time. Sometimes having no events is such a nice feeling, for me at least. \n\nI\u2019m *definitely* not saying this advice 100% cures me, but I hope some of you get the point I\u2019m trying to make here. I hope I\u2019m not mistaken. I have a chronic illness and am often too fatigued to do anything so loneliness is almost like a limb for me. \n\nI\u2019ve also learned a lot about mindfulness and taking the present moment as it is, whatever that may be.

It's the one day of the year where most customers are guys. They come in on their way home from work realizing they didn't get their significant others gifts. We have flowers and other gifts we know we will make money from due to guys procrastinating. Usually people complain about the prices but tomorrow they won't complain. Those guys are going to go home despite them not getting her anything until Valentines Day and end up having sex with their significant other. \n\nDuring the evening we get lots of couples who are out either on their way to a romantic dinner or coming home from it. It isn't the day itself that gets to me but seeing people in relationships who are just out with their significant other on just another Valentines Day while I have never gotten past the first date. I see guys get further with women in front of me than I have at age 35. I know some outsiders think I can just not let it get to me but it is much more complicated than that. If I had friends to go out with then their advice would have merit but I have no friends. I have to face life alone and tomorrow is one of the biggest reminders of something that is so mundane for most people, something I will never get to experience.\n\nI know I'm broke but I'm sure I would get my hypothetical girlfriend something nice for Valentines Day. It would be something silly but she would be able to appreciate it. I know I sound like an evil nice guy but I'm just sad.\n\nPeople tell me how it's just another Hallmark Holiday but even though that is true, it's one of the biggest reminders of something I will never have. Love is more than sex. Love is wanting to be with that person. Love is smiling at them having that look of happy to see that person. Love is going out to dinner on Valentines Day together because you want to. Love is even if you don't have the money to take them out or buy them an expensive gift, something small that they would appreciate because of the thought of the gift. \n\nI hate myself.", "subreddit": "ForeverAlone"}

And basically capped it all off by saying that if a woman hasn't shown me even the slightest bit of interest in the past 20 years when I was surrounded by young, single women, things probably aren't going to change now that I am about to turn 40 and surrounded by older married women (and too old to be asking out 20 somethings anymore, anyway).\n\nNormally, I do get comments like the first two from time to time and they don't really bother me that much anymore because people have been making cracks about my weight (i play along sometimes too), which is the result of an incurable genetic illness, since I was a little kid.

I've lived on my own since I was 23 and have always had trouble finding and maintaining friendships and relationships. I've gone from one thing to another with people over the years, a lot down to me and a lot down to them, I've punished myself and I've hurt other people, I've owned my guilt and pain and mistakes for years but refused to believe that other people have done the same. I've gone from having stable employment, friends and relationships, being at the top of a mountain but crashing and burning in a short space of time, meaning being made redundant, losing a partner, losing friends, losing opportunities etcetera to having serious depression and wanting to kill myself over and over. This all happened around 2008 and I've struggled to pick up the pieces ever since, never found stable work only volunteer jobs, struggled finding stable friendships and activities that worked meaning keeping up with things instead of things being a flash in the pan. All this time I've lived alone and suffered alone through all of it. I moved a few years ago from Hackenthorpe to Park Hill in the city centre but found it even more difficult being in a block of flats surrounding by people but feeling more isolated and alone. I've tried making my place nice and making a new start, tried to turn things around but get sucked back to that negative and lonely cycle. \n\nTried to reach out but it's like being in space and you're in a void with nothing biting in return, even when I have met people and done things nothing becomes permanent it's like walking on thin ice, you're ok for while but you know things won't stay that way for long and they inevitably don't. \n\nI'm a great person when people get to know me but unfortunately nobody has been invested enough for me to fully trust them and for me to give them my all.\n\nSorry for the rant but there you go x", "subreddit": "lonely"}

I would've started exercising earlier and I would've forced myself to study more. If there's one thing I don't regret it's not creating social media accounts, I don't have any at all other than a dummy FB one that I don't use anymore. I also would've told myself that not everyone in the world is nice, and so I shouldn't be so naive when it comes to meeting new people. High School was a reality check for me, it was one of the worst yet probably the most important things to have happened to me. Not in an academic perspective, but through a social one. I can't really remember anything I learnt in HS but I can remember the embarassing moments I had, even the small things. I probably would've told myself to stop being such a pussy, to just go for it if I were interested in anyone. I'm a 16 year old suicidal NEET, with no redeeming qualities. I don't even have confidence and I look half-decent. Confidence is key in these situations to be honest, discipline is also important. Something I also don't have. Really, all I wish I had was experience. Experience in socializing, memories I can look back on even if they were dumb or things I would be able to remember. I don't have those experiences, and I'm not street-smart. It's probably what makes me feel most left out in this generation, I feel like a toddler as compared to everyone else my age who have groups of friends go out. Instead, I spend most of my time inside my bedroom because I'd rather wallow in self-pity as opposed to doing something about it. I admit I am not trying anymore, I admit I have given up. When you see life for what it is, and you get to a point where you're literally just waiting to die - you have no purpose. It's pretty fucking soul crushing to be honest. Sometimes, I wonder if I could just be drugged up 24/7 so that I wouldn't have to face the reality of what things really are, perhaps there's something out there that would make me so brain dead I wouldn't even have to think of such things - I'd be in my own little place and wouldn't have a care in the world. I would be docile as fuck, and to the outside I'd look like a fucking zombie perhaps. But I wouldn't care. As long as whatever I'm taking takes me to a better place than whatever this shite is, I'd be happy. Even on Reddit, I'd feel left out when a highly upvoted question reaches the front page. Questions that involve life experiences and memories. I just don't have them. Everyone says it's because \"I'm only 16\" but that doesn't make any sense at all. Memories are created from when you were in your childhood anyways, or your teen years. I should at least have a few by now but I don't, and I'm certainly not creating any as of right now. I guess some people were just born to be outcasts and loners, it's our personality after all. I can't force myself to be extroverted and confident when I've literally spent most of my life doing the exact oposite. \n \n\n[EDIT]\n\nTLDR: Buy bitcoin", "subreddit": "ForeverAlone"}

Can\u2019t really rely on family either as they\u2019re all ex-addicts or fucked in some way. I\u2019m the \u201cnormal\u201d one. Theatre/music/performing/writing has saved me. Just wish I could have someone to hold/share my life with. But modern society has strongly adapted to hook up culture and has lost its ideals/values. \n\nI miss being held, loved and told everything\u2019s alright. I\u2019m sure that\u2019s what we all have in common here. :(\n\nReality is a lovely place, but I wouldn\u2019t wanna live there. \n\n", "subreddit": "ForeverAlone"}

Idk why, but this really hurt, as I've known these people for 12 years. \n\nThese people are my friends in school, because we are basically all big nerds. I keep a high GPA, and take all honors courses. Because of this, I only see these people all day. There's about 15 of us. My hobbies do not align with anyone else's hobbies in this group. \n\nIdk what I'm doing wrong. I know for sure I can be a bit annoying at times because I'm relatively high energy.

I'm terrible with eye contact but even in the middle of a conversation with someone, I will stare in random places. I don't mean to cause any discomfort that it has and will cause. \n\nTonight at work I stared at this random young woman in line but I didn't mean to. It's hard to explain. She became creeped out and let other people go in front of her until she was able to go to another person. I felt terrible but obviously couldn't say anything.\n\nWhen I was a kid I used to stare outside. I wasn't staring at anything specific but instead daydreaming. The teacher got mad at me then pulled down the shades. In college I was at a dinner with a couple on the other side of the table. I kept staring ahead and she thought I was staring at her chest. She even poked him which got me to realize what I was doing and looked up. \n\nI'm sure I sound very creepy when I say this and I don't blame anyone for thinking I do this on purpose. Honestly, I don't specifically stare at anything or anyone. Usually I don't even see that object or person. My attention is towards what I'm thinking.

I used to say that a lot to myself so I wouldn't feel so bad, but it drives me nuts the more I think about it. There is a difference between being alone and being lonely. But they aren't mutually exclusive. And when they hold hands the same way you wish you could with someone else, it feels like there's a piece of you missing that you didn't even know existed before. \n\nI started telling myself this mantra sometime after my graduation from high school nine years ago. I've kept to one night stands with absolute strangers, and, guy or girl, it always felt the same way. And now as I'm growing older, I realize that the things that give every bit of life its vibrant shades of colors are more beautiful than ever when you open your soul to someone. When you can stand under an umbrella, so close to each other that you can feel each other's body heat. When you hold hands for so long that your skin gets clammy and you both giggle as you wipe your palms on your pants and go right back to it, fingers intertwined. \n\nWhen you can tell someone about the things that almost broke you for good, feeling an otherworldly comfort in being vulnerable with someone who wants to wipe your tears off your cheeks and fill every void in your being with an acceptance that has always eluded you.\n\nI hate to be such a clich\u00e9, but as I witnessed people today celebrating their love, I remembered that while it's okay being alone, and loving who you are, it doesn't stop your spirit or your mind from aching for someone to love you the same way.

For example recently I've witnessed a female (neutral, well hearted, trying to help) being literally bullied on an incel subreddit (\"get out roastie\") and attacked for everything she said and spewed in the worst way possible. On the flipside we have females which complain about loneliness yet their negative and self-loath makes it harder for them to connect with others.\n\nRecently I was talking to a girl on this subreddit and I genuinely liked her, I dedicated vast amounts of my day towards communicating my feelings to her and she described me as \"nice, appreciative, caring, thoughtful, supportive, open, interesting, expressive, helpful, positive\", the best guy she ever met with nothing to improve upon, yet she still decided to cut contact one day before valentine's day. Every message was swamped with sorry's of how inferior she feels and how she was lacking but I communicated very well that she isn't inferior to me at all and even if she feels that way there's plenty of time to improve upon that. But nonetheless, she hated writing so she ended up cutting it.\n\nMany people are feeling lonely, but not everyone is open to make a change towards it. Even when given the opportunity on a silver plate, some just can't. Personally to me there's something romantic about the idea of an honest and loyal guy saving a lonely girl out of her misery and making her eternally happy and in turn saving himself. I know it's a naive idea, I know we're long out of that age, maybe it's not even meant to be but I can't help but clinge to it and I refuse to give up on it and remain dedicated to self-improvement.\n\nBut I'm not going to lie, it's so rough to fall over and over when you think it's almost reachable. But as they say, sometimes the only way to save yourself, is to help someone else. This turned out way longer than I wanted, sorry about that, thanks for reading anyway.", "subreddit": "lonely"}

It's not your fault what happened to you, but it is your fault if you let it consume you. Your brain seeks to avoid repeating that trauma, so you concoct an elaborate notion that you are forever alone in order to absolve you of your own responsibility to form relationships. There is only one way through, and that is a commitment to the growth process whereby you make yourself uncomfortable on a consistent basis and develop the mental tools to talk yourself into seeing failure and rejection as growth, as necessary steps in the process to solving the problem. You can relate this to nearly anything, try the pain of playing guitar before you have developed callouses on your fingers or the pain of challenging your heart and lungs to provide oxygen while placing stress on your body. Systems only change under constant pressure, and it is your responsibility to put that pressure onto yourself. You do it in other areas of your life, and it has made you successful in those areas. You must extend this same process to social skills and forming relationships. This subreddit was ostensibly designed to provide support and empathy, but it must not enable you to stand still and avoid the necessary step of failure on your road to success. You may exercise your right not to go through with this, but make no mistake, that is a choice you are making and not something that is being done to you. Good luck to all", "subreddit": "ForeverAlone"}

Starting around the beginning of 2018 (I was about 16 at the time) I dated a girl who walked, talked, and looked like she was in her late teens. However, She wasn't quite 13 years old yet. We went to a dance together, went to a few parties together, we hung out and kissed a lot, but nothing beyond that. Not knowing how special it was supposed to be. It took Me awhile to realize that the age gap between the two of us just wasn't going to work out. And when My parents found out that We we're dating, they were, of course, furious. I'm 17 years old now, and she's 13. I still see her a lot, and she takes several classes with Me. I know that our relationship is out of the question, but I can't help but feel emotionally attached to her. Though I don't normally celebrate Valentine's Day, I thought it would be a nice excuse to write My friends some notes telling them that I loved them and cared about them. I wrote this girl a note as well, not wanting her to feel left out. I had a note in My bag that I wrote, thinking that I was going to give it to her. I eventually decided not to give it to her due to the fact that I thought it was a bit too flirty and shit. And I don't want to lead her on and hurt her more. It's just not right. I genuinely see her as a friend, but she seems to want more than that. And I can't help but realize that I don't exactly have an iron will, and I can see Myself giving into her sometimes. There's a get together coming up and she wants to dance with Me there. But I know for a fact My parents are going to lose it if I were to dance with her at this event. The entire thing has been off and on for months and it's absolutely killing Me. I Love her very much and I know that a relationship with her wouldn't be good for either of us right now. So I refuse to let one develop. But she draws Me in. I don't know what to do. I've made a mistake, I've been careless with this person's feelings as well as My own, and I hate Myself for it. Not being able to talk to her normally in front of My parents is driving Me crazy. And I'm sure it's driving her crazy as well. And they don't even pretend to have any interest in helping Me. Every time I bring it up, they have hurtful things to say, and they won;t give Me a chance to speak about it and explain how it's making Me feel. What's wrong with Me? What have I done?

I struggled to find best friends and struggled a lot with just seeing everyone else have fun (especially my sister who is popular and has tons of friends) and go out on the weekends when I would just sit at home. I was excited to graduate and go to university thinking it would be a fresh start and I would finally get to experience the things I\u2019ve wanted to such as getting a good group of friends and having a boyfriend. But the years almost over in a few months and I only have one friend and sit in my room most of the time. I just feel like it\u2019s never going to change. And I do try to go out and do things but it just seems like people don\u2019t want to be my friend. And I still haven\u2019t had my first kiss or date.

From the second i saw her i knew i had to be friends with her. I'm a goth, and i could tell from the way she was dressed she was too. I'd never had a goth friend before...at least not in person.\n\nAs time went on i realized we had a decent amount in common, we shared a lot of the same interests to differing degrees. I started to become interested in her. I think I get interested in people relatively fast and easy because I've been single for 4 almost 5 years now. As time went on that interest turned into actual feelings. Normally, I don't allow my feelings to develop to the level of a crush and keep it as an interest. These kind of things never go well for me, so it's basically become a pattern. For her it was different, I felt safe letting my walls down with her and I don't know why. I thought she'd be different, when i was around her...I started to remember what being happy was like and when I would hug her...it just felt right.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI did everything I could so that when the time came, she'd give me a chance. I tried to be reliable, every time she asked for help I agreed even if it was inconvenient to me. There was a time where I had pulled a muscle in my foot...it hurt just to walk, but she needed me to take her to a station so she could get home and I ran to my car despite the pain because I didn't want to let her down. I bought her food on a few occasions when she didn't have any money but i knew she was hungry. When she told me she didn't want anything else, she always got excited when she got her food back and realized I had secretly bought her some desert like Chocolate chip cookies or cheesecake or something was in her bag. She said I was sweet...I made her laugh a lot. She eventually figured out I liked her and weaseled some info out of me on what i thought about her. Asked me stuff like, why I like the girl I was into and if I thought she was pretty. She could tell I really liked her, but i told her that if the girl I liked turned me down I'd be fine. I said that I don't get to meet people like her very often so even if the girl turned me down I'd just want to be her friend when it's all said and done. She knew I was talking about her, but apparently it meant nothing.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOne day out of no where...she stopped replying. I eventually ran into her in person, and the interaction we had was enough to solidify to me that she had ghosted me. All the time and effort I put in...and this is how it turned out. This is all rather recent. Valentines day brought it back out of me as i started to feel like i was over it. It just feels like the world is trying to show me that there's no purpose in letting myself feel things, somehow it always turns out like this. I'm just tired of feeling like I'm never good enough.

Almost every day i red the stories from this community for a long time. Aldo i made this account a couple of days ago when i was high on xans. I fell like i need to share my just to pay my deed to you guys, i truly hope you read all the way to the end, Here goes my history and my experience with depression and loneliness. It all started when i was 12, i had a lot of problems in my family and one day (i will remember that day till i die) it all just broke down on me. I woke up hopeless, i woke up like a husk. And since that day, weather did not matter, situations did not matter, people around me did not matter, it was just all grey. A constant switching between anxiety and depression, it was hell for me for a long, long time. I spent my time alone, year after a year, if you passed by my house you would see a kid in a red west and small boots playing all by himself. I escaped into my imagination,and oh boy was i good at escaping and creating walls around my little imaginary world so nobody who would not understand would enter I thought about suicide a lot, but did not do it. It dragged on and on, and situation just kept getting worse.I almost died of alcohol abuse when i was 15 because i saw no way out. All those things forced upon me. Family issues, school grades dropping, first heartbreaks, and since i am a very sensitive person it all got to me really fast. I developed a lot of issues for myself, college began, but i just did not care. I was excited to meet new people and to have a good time. To find a girlfriend. TO have someone to hold me and tell me: Hey, i understand you, it will be okay, i am here for you. I use to dream about that person appearing out of the blue. And you know what? She did appear. A perfection before my eyes, anything i could have asked for. And what next? She left. As quickly as she came into my life. I hated her and loved her at the same time. I drank, booooy, did i drink, just to forget everything and to move on, i did everything just not to think about her and the memories of her. but now i understand, that there is so much a person can handle, and some person just don\\`t click no matter how good they seem together. I moved on, made friends, really good friends, had a couple of girlfriends, but none of those relationships seemed to click. Time passed, classes failed, problems building up once again. I felt like i was stuck in a circle. But it got to me, i do not need alcohol to cure me, i do not need xans, i do not to be surrounded by people to be happy. I just need me to think sober and focus on the stuff that makes me happy. As hard and risky as it was, i had to cut out the things out of my life that hurt me. And i started doing so. I  have made plans, started writing and after 13 years, i feel better, i actually feel happy again. My demons still visit me from time to time \\`doh. But i always find a way to dodge them and deal with them. I enjoy life now, more than ever before.   \nIn the end, i know you are going through a tough time, i know it\\`s hard, as cliche as it seems, and as it sounds i wanna say one thing. YOU are STRONG. Believe in yourself. Do not judge yourself based on what other people tell you about you. And most importantly, DO NOT GIVE UP.

I've never been in any relationship in my life. Not even a kiss so sex is pretty much off the table completely. And now I believe I am so far out of the loop of it all that I just don't know what to do. I don't know what to say, how to behave, how to be confident; I get nervous even trying to hold on simple eye contact while talking to women I think are pretty if it is anything apart from a professional conversation. The amount of time it takes for me to get comfortable enough is in months!\n\nI feel like I'm in a rut and I just can't get out of it. There's a constant self-consciousness that stops myself from being me around people I don't know much. I just have to compare myself with everyone in the room and feel down thinking, how he is better than me in xyz aspects. To make it all worse, I didn't win the genetic lottery and I am a bit overweight (tad chubby, not obese) as well. It's like a vicious cycle...I try to be confident and I try to do better, but because of low self esteem and lack of any experience, I mess up and fail again. Those failures add into all of these issues as a feedback and it's same cycle again.\n\nI tried Tinder. Never got a single match. I am also not into clicking much photos so that didn't help either. So I (I am guilty of it) tried to create a fake profile: Lord Voldemort's. Wrote in a funny bio. And initially that worked. I got matches, but for some reason not a single date. Every girl either rejected, said no or just eventually unmatched. Partially I agree it was also due to my low self esteem which made me back off instead of going all in. But then again, I still remember 3 of them were totally fine talking to me on the app but as soon as we switched to Whatsapp with my real pic on there, without saying much they just unmatched and blocked. I guess because of how I look...anyway, I learnt to get over it/shrug it off,  and tell myself that it is bound to happen time to time. \n\nLater I was advised to \"*be myself\"* which I found funny because when I tried that, I was rejected because of the looks; and when I tried to be just witty, I'm being told to \"be myself\". **If being myself had gotten me anywhere, why the heck you think I would have needed this fake ass profile!?** It's a paradox I can't beat. Also, since I don't drink or smoke, my options to \"hang out\" on weekends and meet people get even slimmer because everyone, for some reason just wants to get hammered. It just has started to take a toll on me now and I am started to get frustrated which I didn't use to before. My roommate's recent success seems to be one of the factors too. I am not jealous of him, I just wonder why can't I do things like these, which everyone finds normal. Why can't I just go out and have a conversation...and click... I'm afraid I will end up an incel which I really don't want to be. But each failure just hurts in the head.\n\nThis has gotten way longer than I expected it to and I don't think anyone will read it this far. However, if you did then thank you. I needed to let this out. I remember 5-6 years back when I was in 2nd year of college I watched *40 Year Old Virgin* and found it extremely hilarious.

I was once in a deep depressive episode during highschool but managed to pull myself out of it, and into something worse. I like to think I poked a hole through rock bottom and now I reside in the imaginary numbers if you asked how I was feeling 1 - 10.\n\nI struggle to remember anything before my depressive episode, and struggle to remember details of yesterday as well. It feels like the ambiance of life has gone hollow and so has my mind. I have fits of pure joy and excitement only to have it taken away for crippling depression. The moments of energy I get, I cannot apply to the things I need to do in life. Its for whatever resides in my mind at that moment. Additionally, I am losing touch with all my relationships. Many people are upset that I don't spend time with them anymore, or that I just let them down. I can't bring myself to see them anymore.\n\nI feel like I have been led by a lie my whole life. I feel like I have told myself to be with people because \"that's the right thing to do.\" Now these days I can't find that lie when I need it most. \n\nI figured it was a lie, because when I look back in my life I ask \"why am I so lonely,\" and usually I respond with \"don't kid yourself, you have all these people who love and care about you.\" At first I thought I was saying I was lonely in the romantic sense. That didn't make much sense either, for when I got into relationships... it was artificial. Yet I would come off overbearing. I tried so hard, because it felt like there was no natural drive to bring me through that relationship.\n\nNow adays, when asked \"why am I so lonely\" I answer back, \"Its not that no one loves you, its that you don't love anyone. You never did.\"\n\nThe first time I said that was about a month and a half ago, and ever since I've been declining. Its as thought I have found a revelation that has brought shadow instead of light.\n\nI wish I was depressed. That was manageable. To have everything taken away showed me I can get it back.\n\nNow I get everything I could ask for, and lose it all every three hours.\n\nI miss having nothing, because no body could take anything away from me anymore.

I've never masterbated more than twice in one day. I'm 27 years old and I figured my hormones would have died down a little by now but if anything, I think about sex an awful lot. I have an account on Pornhub and signed up for a premium account once (did a trial and paid for a month by accident as cancelling early didn't work for some reason). \n\nOn top of that, I've created a separate Twitter account to my main one strictly for porn (for some strange reason Twitter like Reddit is amazing for porn) where I follow all the pornstars, I have bookmarks on my PC for various sites and hentai (no shame) and a hard drive hidden in my room full of porn scenes. So to say I *might* have a porn addiction is kind of an understatement right? I have deleted said accounts and files before only to start up again a few months later. It's too difficult to stop with everything you can get online now and I think it can mess men up because it creates an unrealistic image of women if you get what I mean. I'm not deluded, I'm aware that porn is a complete fantasy and when you really think about it, getting off on others having sex is pretty weird but I find it too difficult to ignore at times.\n\nI believe porn has played a part in me being FA and while I would like to stop looking at it all together, it's a tall mountain to climb.

I've lurked Reddit for a while often looking at posts for advice or just for someone interesting, but I've never written anything.\n\nI can't seem to make friends, its really messing with me. I used to be so good at it in high school, but now it seems every person I meet seems receptive and friendly but hardly ever results in just being a casual friend. I had a girlfriend for 5 years who I had a son with, and she always had friends over which was nice, but towards the end she was controlling and abusive. When I finally ended it many people saw it as my fault, and that I had mistreated her. I was pretty heavily depressed for the last year I was with her.  Most of those friends wouldn't speak to me anymore, or at least causally decline to see me.  I slowly had a few people that felt I were on my side and they really helped me through it. \n\nShortly after I met a girl, who I'd known while with my girlfriend, but I didn't know her that well.  This girl slowly got closer to me, I talked about my breakup and she talked about hers, but we took it slow because we had both been through a rough time. Eventually we got very close, she told me things she had never told anyone before, I told her a lot I felt too. We had a few ups and downs, but we got to the point in about the last month or two where we were sleeping  in the same bed 3-4 nights a week, we had sex a few times and It just felt right, not like a hookup. She texted every day, without fail. Always wanted to see me, told me everything that was happening.  Almost no one other than her and my family were speaking to me at this point. I really wanted to date her, but was cautious. \n\nFast forward to this Monday before Valentines day and we had an argument. We had a date planned ON Valentines Day. She was always so reasonable and understanding and this felt totally out of the blue. She kicked me out of her house and I barely got my shoes back. I was shocked. 2 days later I texted and apologized and said I wanted to talk about why she was upset. She said she needed time. I have no idea why she would just completely shut me out. I have even told her how much her friendship means, We were very close, even just as friends. I always respected that, and tried to help her any way I could. \n\nBut now I'm realizing... I don't really have any other friends, I casually know people at work, and I have my family (All of which live 600+ miles away) But I can't really see anyone to  just say \"Hey, I'm not feeling good, just wanna go hang out\". It feels horrible. She has many close friends and would go and see them. I was invited a few times and then it just didn't happen. I know its really self destructive to think that people just don't want me around but It seems that's the case. I've gone out and talked to people but I can't seem to connect with anyone. It's just made me worse and worse.  \n\nI've been pretty drunk the last 4 days and haven't been working because of the Chinese New Year. (I'm a truck driver at the port) This has to be the biggest low I've had in a long time. Just wish I had ONE friend to hand out with for a night and help me through this. I don't normally drink this much. I don't think its just her, I want to have guy friends or other people I could just talk to.\n\nI'm drunk now, can't believe Im putting this out there, but hey maybe someone will say something.

She worked 2nd shift I worked 1st shift in same area, she would take over for me. We got along great I make her laugh I feel like she likes me. Third week of knowing me she gave me her number she said incase I needed to know something work related. We start texting, eventually she even starts hugging me when she sees me, big hugs too. She even text me that she loves hugging me. Around June she is moved to different area to do more complicated work, I also change to night shift and different area on other side of building because of school. We still see each other when she is leaving work in break room, everything is good. But then the fall semester starts so I start my shift earlier but still in night shift, so we dont see each other anymore but still text. I should also mention that I think I am friend zoned because she would text me stuff like \"good night friend\" \"hi Buddy\". But I'm FA so idk.\n\nThis is when my first mistake happens. Im texting with her and mention that I got a good raise. She text me this \"Thats good now you can take me out\". What do I do? I reject her by saying \"I would take you out but I'm so busy, when I have free time for sure\". In my defense I was super busy work 40+ hrs and full-time school. But I panicked, i got insecure because I have no experience, I wouldn't even know where to take her.\n\nSo after this we still text occasionally but we both are busy so not much. The last conversation I have wit her we texted like we normally would friendly. Then like 2 weeks later my brother took a cute photo of me holding my cat in a blanket like a baby. This girl likes cats, so I text her \"You want to see my son? \", planning to send her the pic after she said yes, but she never responded. I was like whatever, if she wants to talk to me ill let her text me first. She never responded. Then like 2 months later on New years day I decided to take another shot, and sent her a happy new years text, again she never responded.\n\nThis whole time we still work same company, but haven't seen her in person like for 4 months. Still work different shift and I have never run into her. Until this past week. I was in the break room by myself , around this time her shift is already gone. I was filling up my bottle in water cooler, when I hear behind me the door open, it took me a sec but when I turned I see that its her. But she had turned around and left I was able to see the side of her face thru the window in the door. So she opened the door saw me in there and just turned around and left. I was like wtf, why would she avoid me?\n\nI had a chance to escape but I was an idiot. But I'm also confused as to why she avoided me and stopped responded to my text. All I can think of is when I asked her if she wanted to see my son she took it literally and thought I actually have son and probably a wife or gf.\n\nAnyone have something similar happen to them ?", "subreddit": "ForeverAlone"}

I got compliments and congratulations for the effort, invites to social gatherings and parties... but I still wasn\u2019t being chosen. \n\nIn the five years since I\u2019ve tried to turn this franchise around I watched as younger family members where chosen, got married and had kids; younger coworkers married (sometimes to other coworkers) and gushed about their new homes and texts between their significant others and lamented about the agony of planning date nights and keeping things new in the bedroom. It made family get togethers and after work parties anxiety filled nightmares. All I could see was what I didn\u2019t have and what I didn\u2019t want to make them feel bad for having and celebrating. I stuck out like a sore thumb, always a third wheel, agreeing and nodding like an idiot about relationship problems I didn\u2019t have and knew nothing about. And afterwards, on the ride home I\u2019d rationalize that I must be hideous. On the outside, or inside, or both. So I tried working even harder on both. \n\nI threw my all into getting fit, becoming someones idea of fashionable, making dating profile after profile just the way buzzfeed suggested because they know everything, going to hippy dippy new age therapy groups, reading self help books, sage-ing with crystals and positive energy, taking up popular hobbies to \u201cmingle\u201d and appear interesting. And for the record Zumba\u2014especially in Miami\u2014is some bongo thumping bullshit of the first order. Stay home and dance to Gloria Estefan in your own damn living room. Its cheaper and no one is fanning their glittery underarm funk or flinging huge ass sweat droplets in your face but I digress. I took advice from everyone and every thing. No magazine or blog was untapped, no survey not taken or psychic not visited. I faked the funk furiously striving for an ideal that never happened until I lost myself completely and unravelled in the worst way.\n\nLast year, I had a breakdown and thankfully, a breakthrough. I realised all that I had done and spent changed very little in the ways that were important and I was miserable af. So I gave up the fa\u00e7ade. Cold turkey. (Although I still kinda sorta Keep up with The Kardashians...) And while I am happier being myself, watching my weird shows/films, eating what I like, seeing the world and exploring as I wish\u2014I\u2019m doing it mostly alone. The friends I made while I was faking it understandably don't get it, my older friends are accepting but preoccupied with their own families, and worst of all its moving me further away from finding someone to be with which is still one thing I desperately want. Someone to curl up with and watch bad kung fu movies with. To hold hands with when shopping and share inside jokes with. But no one wants to be with the weird lumpy woman that holds up her fingers and shouts \u201cI\u2019m crushing your head\u201d during an argument y\u2019know. Or makes Bevis sounds when a candle is lit. \n\nIt seems like people like weird and quirky women only if they\u2019re of the Zooey Deschanel \u201cNew Girl\u201d maniac pixie trope. When I start describing what really excites and engages me, or I\u2019m simply being my genuine self, expressions fall flatter than a layer of graphene and whatever budding connection had feels vaporized. I often feel hella unwanted and adrift afterwards; regretting opening my mouth at all but I always do it again in the off chance someone will understand and connection will be sparked. It hasn\u2019t happened tho\u2019.\n\nI had one woman tell me straight up after what I thought was a great conversation \u201c...this is why you don\u2019t have a man.\u201d She said it in jest, but it still stung. Others have said it in serious conversations on how to \u201cfix\u201d me. Because I need fixing. And here\u2019s someone I felt comfortable opening up to saying the exact same thing too. It would be easy to dismiss her but I can\u2019t help think she knows what she\u2019s talking about because she\u2019s got a loving husband and family waiting for her every day and I go home to my MST3K collection and a plant named Jeff. \n\nI don\u2019t know what to do anymore. \n\nI\u2019ve \u201cput myself out there\u201d so far I was almost flung out of orbit and yet there were no takers. \n\nIn theory, if you work hard long enough, you\u2019ll get that promotion you want. If you save long enough that TV/Car/thing will be yours. Diet and exercise long enough, you\u2019ll lose those pesky 5lbs. \n\nWhat do I have to do \u201clong enough\u201d to find someone to feel not alone with? Because it damn sure isn\u2019t \u201cwait.\u201d I\u2019ve been doing that for 35 years. ", "subreddit": "ForeverAlone"}

It wasn't just like how friends talked. We had convos from morning to night. There was a period where he would skype me everyday. I was so confused by all this, because he really seemed to like my best friend in real life, but online he would make me feel so special(??)\n\nSo, of course over time, I developed a bit of a crush on him. I'm really shy and awkward, usually guys don't even pay attention to me, so this was a big deal. I was falling for the idea of him.\n\nToday, we went for a show as a huge group (including me, my best friend, and crush). My best friend and crush sat at the end and there were 2 people between them and me. Throughout the whole show they were kind of flirting. My heart was literally shattering. The worst part is that he asked me for my phone so they could take a PICTURE together. Ok, fuck. You. Ugh. I knew a guy wouldnt ever have a genuine crush on me. I'm worthless and hate myself. So yup thats that. Thanks for letting me vent here.. I dont feel like talking to my best friend at this point. Because the truth is, I'm jealous of her.

My only \"friend\" had missed school. I was just standing there while they talked about things I've never experienced - people never invited me to the movies or to parties. I was looking to the ground and tried to say something, but they didn't hear - they couldn't, I'm invisible after all. That's how I feel. I have just one friend. I never go out. I just stay at home.\n\nI still have anxiety, depression, speech problems and can't look at the mirror or seeing photos of myself without starting to cry. I'm almost seventeen and I've got no friends, no social skills and I can't speak my native language without a thick accent. Next year I'll be going to college and this year I will have to sit for the national entrance exams.\n\nI'm feeling very anxious. I feel dumb. What if I don't get an acceptable grade? What if I don't get accepted into a public university? What if I do? I will just stay the same: friendless, lonely, invisible, ugly and unable to speak properly, the only difference being that I'll be the same old invisible me at college.\n\nI've been thinking of alternatives. I've always loved Russian literature. Since I'll be always unhappy, why not try something new at least? Studying something in Russia, like translation, seem like a good alternative venue right? I might be able to translate \"Petersburg\" by Andrei Bely to Portuguese. Sounds great. The only thing being that, besides not having courage to move (or at least thinking I don't), I'll be still the same old invisible me but living in foreign lands.\n\nI hate myself. I'm lonely. No one I know has ever loved me, the last time I was close to someone was at elementary school. Fate has been hard on me, but I'm also to blame.

It's hard to rate myself in terms of looks, but considering my barren dating history, I can only assume that I'm not very attractive. Because of that, I've always kept my sights relatively low. I just got back from hanging out with a girl that I fell in love with, and I thought she was perfect. Talkative, sweet, and not out of my league. I was sure that I had it this time. She spent half the time talking about her perfect, tall, handsome, and charmingly awkward crush. I sat there smiling and nodding as I silently considered swerving my car into oncoming traffic. In hindsight, I shouldn't have tried to go after a girl who was my height.\n\nI've put in a lot of work to get to where I am today, and I've seen real progression. Over the years, I've been weight lifting, running, dieting, reading (self help, philosophy, science), taking speech classes, making music, cooking, practicing brazillian jiu jitsu, putting myself into uncomfortable situations, meditating, and making money (still broke, but I just got my second raise). I did all of this partly for myself, and partly to become a likeable, interesting person. I've only recently started seeing real results. My body looks great, I'm not spending all day in my room anymore, and I can actually find pride in my lifestyle. On especially good days, I can even hold conversations with people. My social anxiety still somewhat controls me, and I still have confidence issues, but I've learned how to live with it.\n \nYou would think that I had a success story by now, but I still don't.  I'm not sure what to blame it on. Maybe it's my height, maybe it's my looks, maybe it's my personality. Whatever the case is, girls just don't like me.

{"post_id": "ars1tg", "created_utc": 1550456191, "title": "Maybe she thought I was gay?", "author": "Akrasia5", "self_text": "So I went to a party and got rather drunk. Three kinds of liquor, beer, wine and whiskey. Lovely stuff. Now this party was my friends 18th and it was in Germany where everyone speaks German but I. Luckily i happened to find a girl at this party who spoke English and spent some hours talking to her while she was completely sober. When people went to play some erotic game, I said I wasn't going to join because I wouldn't understand anyway (actually because I'll shit myself) but she told me she'd translate everything so I should come. Now I was drunk and maybe that meant something, maybe it didn't. So I played the game but at every option I chose guys not girls and not HER. It doesn't help that I was wearing a pink shirt (yes narrow minded comment but who knows) and maybe came off as gay. So after even more time we went for a walk outside, about 5 of us. One of the other people asked us if we liked each other and she paused and said he's nice, but maybe not more.  Of course I was drunk and numb and just thought \"alright\". After sobering up I was disappointed in myself for still not having the courage even whilst being fucked but I guess I took the \"rejection\" well. My main issue is I don't know which it was. Did I come off as gay and that's why she said no, because I was silent to the question and maybe she thought I was hiding a gay thing. That's what I'd like to think (kind of) but there's also a good chance she just thought what every other girl has ever though. Better as a friend. Or a best friend even. Or maybe just to have like me but not like them back. Yeah that's more likely. It doesn't hurt as much as I thought it would, just i could've gotten a clear answer because I've known girls to do stupid games. Or maybe I'm now that guy who would be like \"are you sure you don't like me? Sure sure? No means yes?\" Fuck my life honestly. I don't know what's wrong with me (apart from being bad looking I guess). I find it so hard to believe it's about confidence like people claim. If I was taller or muscular or something then would she have had a different answer. I made her laugh and it was fun. That's not enough is it. It never fucking will be. I've come to terms with the belief that I should have a life and then find a partner to tag along with and not the other way around. The problem is, it's never gonna happen... no matter how long I can keep the optimism up I always fall back down. I can't stop thinking about how I'd sacrifice my life for any of my friends. Not just because they're important to me but because I would have an excuse. Maybe she liked me. Not likely but maybe. This turned into a lot more than whether a girl thought I was gay. Sorry. Good to know I'm not alone in being alone I guess. It never goes away does it. It's not a teenager thing. It'll always be like this and it will never be any easier. Ahh shit. Thanks for reading.

I tried to catch up with him but he wasn't interested, and kept asking me if the designs were done. After I had made them he hasn't got in touch with me since.

Fast forward to past college at 27, and I'm a shell of my former self. I am depressed, have few friends (ones that didn't ditch me already for cooler people), crippingly lonely and becoming increasingly pessimistic and negative. On top of this I have a rare disease (Mal De Debarquement) that doctors can't help me with (almost no one can treat it let alone know what it is), and oh yes, they do have the suicide hotline at the bottom for your enjoyment once you get your diagnosis. Fun times. Back to it: I had literally peaked in high school. I was that guy. Time goes on, and I see my friends get married to gorgeous women, or find seemingly perfect companions and I'm sitting around wondering why I am single, unhealthy, and truly questioning whether I should even go on anymore. At one time, I even had a plan to end it. Thankfully, I made a life changing decision (along with help from my counselor): to stop complaining, to stop blaming others and my own circumstances, and to look in the mirror and own my faults. All of them. I was fucking angry at life, and I decided to use that anger to push me to get back to where I used to be. I started to work out more, which started with a gym routine online and eventually I joined an MMA gym which got me in better shape than I've ever been at 28. That peak body I had once in high school looks like a joke compared to the shape I'm in now. Worked out 4 hours a week minimum, on top of reading self help and dating books (Models by Mark Manson) to improve myself, listening to motivational speakers to change my inner attitudes towards others and myself (Les Brown, Eric Thomas, Jim Rohn, Sadghuru). I did this almost every day and night and when I was ready I went to apply this with girls and.... I still failed. I went out after working on myself for months \"learning\" and... I still wasn't successful with women. They rejected me, even though I am in better shape than I've ever been, and I felt confident in myself, why was I still getting rejected? (I figured out later on why, which I will conclude with) I went out with a girl from my mma gym for a drink in November after asking if she was single. Guess what? She says \"yeah sure!\" yet when we get to the bar days later and sit down: \"Just so you know... This isn't a date. I don't date people who go to our gym...\" Yeah, I'm sure I'm not the only one here who has been on a \"date\" only to be told nah it's really not... So I have my inner dialogue speaking to me: \"What you thought that girl would want to go out with you for real? Dream on dude\" That one really fucking hurt, mostly because I knew I would see her almost every day at the gym after being rejected. Guess what though? I was back there the next day I could and though it was awkward for a little, it's not even on our minds anymore. Did I mention that rejection hurt? Yeah, really fucking badly. I kept learning and I truly knew and believed if I kept trying I would find someone. I kept working out, I kept reading, but more importantly I kept working to LOVE myself and others around me. Fast forward to February 8th: Friday night I am going out with my only single friend and we're going to go bar crawl and try to meet girls. It goes pretty shittily, almost every girl I approach has a boyfriend or isn't interested or I flat out just don't catch their attention due to loud music, friends, my shitty game etc. My friend is disappointed, I am too, but we still have a decent time nonetheless. From my reading on dating, finding someone at a bar on a random night is really tough, in fact it's the toughest environment I can think of as women are on guard and expect to get hit on but I digress: I knew valentines day was on the following Thursday and I KNEW I wouldnt be the only person feeling lonely so I give myself a goal of getting a date for Thursday. Fast forward to Wednesday, and I don't have a date and no prospects to even ask so I Google valentines day events in Dallas and come up with one to go to. I plan on going with my friend who I went out with on that Friday but he bails on me last minute. I have a choice: sit at home and wallow in my sorrow and hate myself for not going the next day, or go and face possible and probable embarrassment and rejection. I could sit and blame my friend for not joining me \"What do you expect me to go by myself to a singles bar at 28?! Come on dude you left me hanging!\" is what I would've said a couple years ago but no, I was fucking determined, and I went alone. I wasn't ashamed of being alone anymore, I accepted that I was lonely and wanted to meet someone. Keep in mind, this bar is a very popular bar in Dallas so the women there normally are very high end. It's an intimidating place to go with friends, let alone.... alone. So I walked in that bar like I owned the mother fucker (and for all they know, I just might) and to my AMAZEMENT there were not only way more women than men but they were almost all cute and single. Most importantly though everyone? THEY WERE LONELY TOO. Every woman in there was looking for someone to love them. They were just as alone or even more alone than I, and equally beautiful. They weren't there to reject men, they were there to meet the man of their dreams. They were literally lining up to meet me... The guy that was going to hang himself almost 2 years later is having women form a line to meet him. I almost had to pinch myself to believe it, but more importantly I met someone there and we've gone on a couple of dates now. So what's the damn point of this post? To tell you that you aren't the only one feeling alone. In fact, I think there are more lonely people now than I've ever seen. To tell you that yeah, currently, you probably aren't good enough for a relationship but that doesn't mean that can't change with work on yourself, and it doesn't need to be that drastic even. That when people tell you to be yourself, they mean to be the best version of yourself, and to be that best version it takes hard work and improving yourself as best as you can. It's easier said than done, as my above story will clearly show. Most importantly though? **You have to truly believe that through improving yourself, through rejection and failure , that you will persevere and find someone. Before I walked into that singles bar by myself, I was sitting in my front seat with Clammy hands, nerves (fuck I'm getting nervous just thinking back to it), tense throat, etc. I literally said under my breath: \"I believe in myself\" and I succeeded. You aren't alone in being alone, and seeing that singles bar full of beautiful yet lonely people really hammered this fact home for me.**\n**TL; DR: Worked on my dating skills for years, failed multiple times, hit rock bottom, went to a singles bar by myself and realized how many other people are equally lonely. Met someone there, but more importantly you aren't alone in being alone everyone. YOU AREN'T ALONE IN BEING ALONE.** [Please listen to some of this video as it helped change my life, it just might do the same for you] (https://youtu.be/bq9X_VItZzA) ", "subreddit": "ForeverAlone"}

Whenever I feel lonely, I call my close friends to have a chat with them. But as time has passed, these friends have found some other priorities in life and now they are unable to provide me with the support I need. I have tried making new friends but I am really bad at it and I am not able to join a new place like a new college where I can find new friends because still 2 years of college remain. Since the last 3 or 4 months have been seriously lonely and depressed. I have taking new hobbies like going to gym or learning music but I am unable to find any interest in them. I really feel like I need someone to accompany me where I go but take isn't happening. I also try watching netflix and youtube but that also provides for a temporary relief.

I've regretted it ever since.", "author": "glassesguy99", "self_text": "Tl;Dr at the bottom, but I would really appreciate it if you read everything. It'll give you way better context to understand what I want to say.\n\nContext: I'm a member of a particular committee at college, and I handle all the photography. At one particular event, I didn't do any photography, but I sorted and shared the pictures people had taken, which numbered almost 2000.\n\nSo it took me about 2 weeks to be completely done with this whole thing, because we had sponsors who wanted separate photos, the performers wanted their photos, random people came up to me every 3-4 days saying they had a folder of about 100-200 photos. And I kept getting more and more frustrated because I was doing this in the week my internal tests were on (my internals are the only thing allowing me to pass).\n\nWhen I finally upload the folder, people start complaining about there not being any pictures of them, or there being only 1-2 pictures. I tried explaining that I didn't click any pictures, and my pictures weren't there either, but they weren't having it. So I exploded. I ranted on the committee message group about having to sort through 2000 pictures during my exam week, with all the BS I mentioned above, and all they can do is complain? I told them that they should've asked me to make sure their photos come, or even better, should have made sure themselves. This led to the 'we're only joking bro' crap, which made me look like the unhinged asshole.\n\nAfter that day, I got the distinct feeling that I wasn't very welcome in the committee 'casual chill' circles, people stopped interacting with me, stopped listening to what I had to say, and basically started ignoring me. And they still do to this day, only it's a little less than before, but still enough to be painfully obvious to me and everyone else. I have no idea how to handle this, and I don't want to confront people because I hate doing that.\n\nTo make matters worse, our committee was supposed to play 2 songs as a band, wherein I would play the drums, being proficient at playing them and all. Plus, I had an electronic kit at home. They couldn't find any other kit for that day, so they told me to bring my kit, saying that I would definitely get to play, there was 100% chance I could play. And keep in mind, I live about 2 hours away from the college, and at 6.30 in the morning I was lugging my drum bag into the building. Then I spent another 1.5 hours assembling it. Then another hour finding a plug for the power. And 2 hours later, I'm still waiting to play, and I'm told that we won't be performing. So I got mad.\n\nBut that's not where it ends. The other guys I was supposed to perform with, went ahead and performed their part while I was disassembling my kit. And that made me hate everyone in the committee, thus leading to my frustration at everyone as I mentioned above.\n\nSorry for going on so long.\n\nTl;Dr - got cucked by my committee, entitled bitches started complaining about not having photos which I hadn't even clicked btw, I ranted at them, now they ignore me.", "subreddit": "lonely"}

I have managed to get through almost 4 years of High School without making any real friends (any that I've hung out with outside of school). For the last \\~2 years I've been basically counting down the days until I graduate, with the hope getting out of HS and into college will fix things for me socially, but the closer I get, the more I realize unless I make some big changes, nothing is going to get better. I am losing hope in the idea that things will really get better for me socially at all.\n\nI have a lot of difficultly talking to people outside of my immediate family. I find it incredibly hard to maintain eye contact and naturally speak very softly, almost inaudibly in a loud-ish public space. I am very kinesthetically awkward; I have no idea what to do with my hands or arms when I speak. I have pretty bad acne, although I'm doing everything I can to try to control it, and I stay decently in shape. I don't think I'm ugly (at least, I hope not), or at least I'm not so physically repulsive to where nobody can stand to look at me. I can't talk to strangers at all, I freeze up and stare at the ground.\n\nIn addition, when I am daydreaming, or thinking hard about something, my hands and arms sort of start to writhe and contort without me noticing, so most people that don't know me think I have some sort of mental issue (maybe I do, I've done this since I was a kid but my parents and I just have always sort of ignored it).\n\nRecently my general feelings of loneliness from fairly severe social isolation have gotten a lot worse, and started to bleed into different parts of my life. Sometimes I feel like I can't get out of bed, and just don't. I've stopped enjoying chess much, my main hobby and passion. I just want normal friends so bad, but I can barely hold a conversation.\n\nI don't really have a specific question or anything, I just needed to write this somewhere, and any advice is appreciated.", "subreddit": "ForeverAlone"}

My parents still have very strict rules about when I can go out, how long I can be out and so on.

Sometimes I stay in school after 4 pm just to have extra lessons or to join a club where I can work over time on my assignments with others. However my parents won\u2019t let me work till midnight (when I occasionally work on weekdays), they won\u2019t let me stay in school over time to work on my assignments either.\nWhenever I am at home they are very abusive, my dad is severly depressed and therefore aggressive and bitter 24/7, my mom is just silent unless when she is drunk, then she gets extremely abusive and starts to call me names, disrupts me in my room when I am trying to do my assignments or talk to friends over phone also she can occasionally threaten to beat me when she is drunk. I understand that requires a lot of work and that it is a whole another life when living alone without parents but since I have abusive parents I actually think I would be much happier without them, my home would be free for the bad energy my parents constantly give out, I would be more motivated, much happier and so on to finish my education (I want to study psychology after college). I get education support since I live in a scandinavian country, here I get 712 USD every month, I can choose to move to a dorm with other students I go to school with - my moneys will then get limited to 600 USD every month since the 112 USD will go to the total price of dorm room and dorm food in total every month. I don\u2019t care that I get a little less money than normal, I just want to live in a safe place where I can work on my school and work in my spare time.\nThe problem here is then that my parents won\u2019t let me move out, they are very overprotective of me and turns crazy whenever I talk about moving out on my own because I think I am better that way.\nWhat to do?", "subreddit": "lonely"}

Nobody respects me, live in home all day playing stupid video-games (actually im passionated about them) wish i could be a \"normie\" and find balance between gaming and irl goals, like normal people who do have friends, family, talking about family, mine is scuffed AF, parents divorced, granpas divorced aswell (LMAO wild modernity), and that really hurts me, because, idk i see people going around with their loved ones and i actually feel i would be happy if i was like them. Even tho is stupid wanting a family in modern days, i think 75-90% of ppl here have their parents living far from each other. I remember when i was 17 and passionate about life, excited for future and college, found a really pretty girl who actually liked me, but as i am a crazy ass i've just dismissed her, when she was actually falling in love with me, why i did that, well in the moment of truth to give her the blowing kiss, when she was happily awaiting for me and her friends were excited to see my \"performance\" kissing her i suddenly gave up, felt like it was too much for me, too good to be true, i've failed, and i did that before this girl and after aswell, Jesus Christ...\n\nBut, believe me folks, that was a good thing i did for her and me, why? well, after being disappointed with me and actually thinking i was gay (i believe she must've done that, idk) she found one of these pumped up anabol gym boys and guess what? he's rich af, because of his parents, well she just hit the jackpot (man every woman dream i guess), which would be way better than being my girlfriend and being bored of spending weekends in home doing nothing, (maybe the only good part would doing sex) with a douchebag loser like me (yeah i do have serious auto-confidence problems, lacks of PE in high school? LMAO) , then cheating on me because i was idk...put some stupid excuse here (unexcitable?) boring person...and me being pissed about that...well whatever, i just think i couldn't deal with a cheater...for real (judge me, toxic white male...whatever honour is dead anyway).\n\nWell, now lemme explain the being the retarded late college which will probably never graduate because i'm so pissed about my life can't even study anymore ( believe me when i was in that 17 phase i actually used to enjoy studying FOR REAL) which bothers me the most is this last thing, if i could reclaim this excitment for studying and start looking after myself i could deal with the rest of my life, for real, people say \"fuck motivation, all you need is discipline\" i don't believe that in any way, i think both (motivation and discipline speeches are braindead content).\n\nWell i did started this enjoy for studying because where i live, and it's like that in every other place in the world, degree matters a lot, but here a degree it's like a key that open the Portal of the Truth, Pandora Box or whatever, i mean to look like a human being u need a degree otherwise you are a worthless body...yes it's like these in the rest of the World for sure, specially with automated jobs, robots, \\]\"learn to code\" LOL turning a real thing. And i've tried to enter in a very competitive college which has a very hard entrance exam, where regular people, not 140 iq, spend in average 2-4 years to enter...and i've immersed myself with body and soul trying to pass, thinking that would actually improve my life, help me find a good job, that i would be actually usefull for people and that i could serve to the progress of my country, and...well it would do all of that if i had passed...and my irl problems just went thougher, just when i was preparating for the exams, mom got a pneumonia, maybe just because i've lfet home and i'm a lone son so she actually cared a lot  about me being close to her, while that she had problems with her 2nd husband, actually feel abashed when saying that, not because what y'all think of it, but for how i see her, like a wh\\*\\*\\* or...damn it's hard to admit that for yourself...not easy, i do value a lot honor and all, some might not understand this but...whatever. Plus i was always an addicted into games and to masturbation, yeah i've trying to stop, and feel much better, that thing can fuck your life like any other drug. Can't stop with the video game addiction tho, fuck that i will never stop, even tho i recognize it does brain damage (can already imagine the anger of someone who enjoys games reading that, sorry, but it's true) but i can't live without it, there's this neuroscientist who says every kind of screen (TV, internet, youtube...) can fuck up your brain really bad basicly because it blocks ur imagination, i do believe him but i can't stop for real,unless i drastically change my life.\n\nNowadays i feel like i will finish my life as a Barney Gumble...because i LOVE alcohol, can't imagine what i would turn if i did drugs, for real.\n\nWell i feel deep in the heart i have way more to write, but i kinda feel relieved after exposing myself for random unknown people i will never see in my life, so i guess that's all folks, thanks for readingn till this point, AMA you want to know, don't feel ashamed, i like to talk to people here, only place i actually have conversations.

I've lost over 100lbs but my journey isn't over I still have a good 50lbs to lose and frankly the increased libido has probably made me even more sad.

I don't just mean romantically or flirtatiously...when was the last time somebody, *anybody*, told you they loved you, be it familial, platonic, gratitude, or whatever? Did they say it of their own accord, or did you have to prompt them/provide them with a verbal cue? (Btw, head's up, this is a long one. TL;DR at the bottom, I promise.)\n\nI ask this here because I saw something posted on my Facebook feed a few moments ago, one of those blatant screencaps from a Tumblr page that invites people to 'reblog' if they tell their friends they love them 'even if it's platonic.' The comments I read on the back of this were full of people who say about how they always tell their friends and immediate family at every opportunity, and the majority of what I read also mention that their friends/family do the same to them...\n\nI had to stop and think about this, as I had a similar conversation with one of my best friends a few months ago - I would tell him I love him at least once every time we met up (which isn't very often, about 2 or 3 times a year at least), but asked him if he felt I said it too often. Said friend was also the last person to tell me he loves me, by text, after the stroke of midnight on Jan 01 this year...after I, once again, told him first. This is the first time he's ever said this to me, and we both know that this is platonic.\n\nWhat bothers me about this is that I'm fairly open about my feelings towards other people, and if I genuinely love someone I'll tell them unashamedly. But it seems like no one has the same mindset or feels strongly enough for me to say it without having to wait for that verbal cue from myself first. I get that some people, especially men (being one myself), have reservations about being so openly vulnerable, but...surely the emotion is there all the same?\n\nI do not recall the last time someone - family or friend - has ever told me that they love me. When I ask my parents if they do, their automated response is \"of course I do,\" despite the fact that my parents and I are probably more distant than ever before (even to each other), but they will never actually say it to me (at least not to my face), the three specific words. \"Of course I do\" feels like it's almost an attempt to brush the issue under the carpet without having to confront it.\n\nI can't help but feel that it's something to do with me, that people just don't feel that strongly about me in any manner. It's one thing to be without a relationship for the past 13 years, but when you're doubting just how genuine your friends are too...this is a level of FO that I hate but have grown accustomed to at the same time.\n\nI guess, to finish, what my best friend says rings true: \"If you can't love yourself, how can you expect anyone else to?\" How can I love myself if there's nothing about me *to* love to begin with?\n\n(TL;DR - Think about how long it's been since someone told you they loved you, and whether or not you had to prompt them to say it.)", "subreddit": "ForeverAlone"}

Those two go together; for some people to be considered beautiful, some have to be considered ugly and unfortunately, whether or not we are \"beautiful\" isn't up to us. Being ugly is a bit like being a janitor; nobody *wants* to do it, but somebody has to. And if you feel that you are ugly then you just happen to be one of those people whose destiny it is to be ugly. It's not personal, it doesn't mean anything about you. It's just how things are.\n\nKnowing all this won't stop you from being attracted to beautiful girls (or guys) though. If there were a god this would be his way of torturing you; making it so that you're attracted to people who don't find you attractive at all. The worst is when you forget that you're unattractive so you \"put yourself out there\", only to be reminded of how unwanted and unattractive you are. And of course, this leads to you hating yourself for trying, which makes you wish you weren't attracted to anyone at all.\n\nIf you're unattractive you can have [\"Gold in your soul\"](https://soundcloud.com/remedy97/gold-in-my-soul-prod-by-sno) (shameless plug) but nobody will want to see it because the surface is too unappealing.\n\n*\"He heard that women often love unattractive, simple people, but he did not believe it, because he judged by himself, and he could only love beautiful, mysterious and special women.\" - Leo Tolstoy*", "subreddit": "ForeverAlone"}

I mean I have friends - including close friends, two roommates friends, caring family, colleagues, fellow students and volunteers, some random people talks to me in the streets or wherever as I talk to them, I meet new people, etc. But despite all those people who would forbid pretty much anyone to describe me as lonely or alone, well, I just really feel like I am.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI believe that the main reason of my feelings is that I really don't have anyone to talk about or when I do, it really never lasts long. How long ? Well I had friends when I was a child, and then I cut the bridge with them as I went to middle school where I made new friends and then I cut the bridge with them and I made some new friends in high school and as the same time online, and as I moved to another city I cut the bridge with my high school friends and maybe two years after with my online friends. I made some new ones in university and as I know some of them for 6 years, well, I'm starting to think a lot about cutting the bridge with most of them, if not all of them.   \n\n\nMaybe if you're reading this are you thinking I am a bad person : \"Watch this guy, he has friends, and then he lefts them with no regards, and planning on doing the same again, how selfish or utilitarian do you have to be to do that ?\". Well that kind of true. I don't care that much about people, and I think I just connect with them as they can do stuff with me that I like (playing football or going to concerts for example) or provide me some original thoughts or perspectives. When they can't do any of that anymore (because I or they change their hobbies), well I just stop seeing them. Am I a bad person for doing that ? Sometimes I believe so, and some other ones I don't. I guess I'm just like that. I don't really like people but I do like some activities which are better with others people and I love ideas which people can provide. It's not something like I have everyone, mankind, etc. and maybe on the contrary. I really care about humanity or abstract persons. But concrete ones ? Not so much. Just like that. I'm not proud or desperate of it by any means. I'm just like that, always been, not sure I want to feel otherwise on the subject, not sure I could change on it.  \n\n\n\"What's the problem then ? Just get on with it and lose you friends as you did before\" you could say, but I believe the issue or my feeling about it is a little different this time. Firstly because, as I get older, I don't believe it 's that easy to make new friends anymore, and not that close. I mean I make some new friends over the past years but I really feels like as you get older you kind of lose your space for new relationships and that you can'y really meet new people as you did before. But I'm finding really hard to believe I can make new friends with whom I can go to holidays. Close neighbors or colleagues ? Yes surely. But better than that ? uh. Maybe I sound contradictory (\"do you want friends or no ?\") but maybe it is because I didn't said that I love to have friendships, really, but with conditions, which mainly are protecting myself and my goals.  \n\n\nAnd that's the main problem here. Some of my closest friends are in another city and for the three or four I have in this one, there is two (including one of my roommate and my best friend) that I just can't stand anymore. Really. Badly. And I suppose that my recent loneliness come from the fact that I'm losing two of my best friends, let alone my introvert and lonely personality. I'm not here for relationship advice because it's not a relationship problem. It's not that I saw them to much in a short time or that we have any issues at the time. I just don't get along with their personalities anymore, and I don't believe they'll change (they didn't really since I meet them and I didn't too). Maybe I'm just sad this as to be. Yeah we're not friends anymore (or I ain't your friend anymore). Just like that. Another great or cool or idk relationship over.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnd maybe I don't feel that good because for the first time I really believe I'll be alone of my life. When I was a teenagers I already had the same kind of thoughts about my friends but at the time, I can of believe it was because as I was in not that big of a city I didn't get to connect with people that could really be my friends for long, knowing my personality and my goals but as I cloud thought the broken bridge with my online friends as an argument for that, I do see it now. It's seems I just can't be friend with people for a lot of time, maybe five dense years at the most. And maybe as I adult, as my relationships are going to be more sporadic, they'll last longer, but they'll end up anyway, in not that long. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI think I'm reaching the conclusion of this post, as I had something on my heart and somehow I explain it to me (and to you) here. And I'm kind of scared of the vision I have from the future me, alone, which could reach people but doesn't want to although I'll like to care concretely about anyone else, but I wont. Somehow, and however I don't had any interest for romantic relationships in my entire life (too much of a concern for someone else than me and too much on an affective involvement for my need to be free as I can be are the main reasons), I'm kind of starting to be interest in them,  not in a sexual or a passionate ways, but more in a way where I'll have someone (and children maybe) to share with, regardless of the help it/they can provide, and I could just care about them, helping them making their best. Guess I could do that with my friends of the moment too - but I'm not sure I want too. Maybe the thing is, I shouldn't trying to find people that can be of some help for me, as I always be did, maybe I just should find people that I want to help, just because I'll like them. Do I like or do I like them indirectly, for what and only what they provide me, base on my current needs. Don't know if I'm a jerk or something. Maybe I am and I can be something else, with current friends and relationships or some fresh and new one. I really don't know. Maybe this is really where I'm confuse, and what causes me those feelings that I have. And where I need help. I don't know.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnyway, thank for reading I guess, and please forgive for my poor expression.", "subreddit": "lonely"}

I feel like im talking to a computer AI and its just having fun with me. some long never ending practical joke.\n\nIve just been alone so long like this and unable to connect to people that it feels so exhausting even the idea of talking to people online anymore.People all dissapear, turn out to be crazy, dont give a shit or are so high maintenance its not worth it.  Then my anxiety issues are so bad in person i cant seem to find people that way either. \n\nI did call and schedule a therapy appointment to start seeing somebody this coming  Tuesday but who knows if it will help. Ive been in and out of therapy my entire life and nothings really helped so far. Im not without hope but working on something for 20 and 30 years with very little to show for it can wear you down. Im a strong person but not invincible. \n\nAlso the fact im a really sensitive person doesnt help either. I read into things a lot of times and over think due to the anxiety. Then the chronic cycle of loneliness causes things to become distorted too so i cant even read people correctly. \n\nI watched  an interview of this famous writer director the other day. He was saying he felt so out of touch and alienated. The interviewer mentioned how all his movies now were in the past etc. He admitted he felt more comfortable there instead of our \"grim\" present. It was a nice escape.How he avoids new technology and still writes on his old typewriter because thats what hes used to.What feels \"normal\" for him.  I kinda feel like that too. The being unable to connect to the world now. I feel seperate and  out of synch. Out of touch. I have to look up just about everything people are talking about  Because i dont even know who half the famous people or acronyms or sayings or memes oe etc etc are anymore. Part of it is getting older and its normal but part of it is just this isolation.  \n\nBecause of this i have just grown to kind of hate and despise society now a days.  I really dont want to. Im a loving, kind caring, open heart and open minded person. I care about people deeply. In todays world though thats almost viewed as some kind of weakness. To me, people just dont seem like people anymore. I start to kind of dissassociate i guess you call it where people just seem like bags of meat walking around. No soul no heart. Just automatons on repeat. Clones of the next clone of the next clone. I really hate that. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI just want to find a new normal that doesnt involve sitting in a room everyday waiting to die. Im not even really depressed. Just this constant loneliness is a lot to carry around all the time. Its heavy this vicious cycle. The darkness is kinda blinding. Spiritual fog it feels like.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI used to write poetry sometimes to get bad feelings out. Cant do that anymore the words dont really come because it feels pointless. I used to at least play video games online and i met a group of friends that way and we gamed together for many years. Now i dont see them. Havent had a real life friend besides my wife probably since a little after highschool. I really hope this therapy helps because im at the end of my rope. IVe been in and out of therapy for years nothings really helped.  Im tired of pretending things will get better and trying and trying and nothing really changing. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLike i say im not depressed but it does get very lonely feeling like I dont even exist anymore. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAs i said im not looking for any advice or anything at all really. Just needed to write this down. Thanks for listening and have a good day. ", "subreddit": "lonely"}

But it is seriously fucking me up. For the past few years my best friend and I have been (not) dating, not actually dating but basically dating, for whatever stupid moronic idiot reason I can surmise I decided we should be lax a little bit and be less \"datey\" I did still have a big crush, I was just an absolute moron. we kind of just lived together and remained close friends. After quite some time I ended up randomly finding a girl who was awesome, and we spent a lot of time together. I mistakenly spent far more time with her, nearly completely ignoring my best friend (I know. Im such a nice time) I most likely didn't even see it cause Im a fucking idiot. Anyway, that relationship crashed and burned and my feelings for my roommate re emerged (I dont think they ever went away, I think I was just blind to it). Anyway, now she (understandably) has a new lover and is also moving out, and Im so pissed at myself for being a dipshit. Me and my roommate have talked a lot about this the past few days, we've spent so much time together in the past few years Im not really sure what to do. Before me and her really started hanging out I was quite lonely, very lonely (not exactly the romantic type if you couldn't guess) and I will soon be forced back into that threshold and that scares me tremendously. It will likely be the last Ill really see of her, and I feel so destroyed. I hate myself more than anything, im having a very difficult time grieving, I cant eat anything, Ive slept a total of about 6 hours in the past 3 days, I cant muster myself to do anything aside from complain to the internet folks about my problems...It's quite pathetic really.

{"post_id": "asu4mm", "created_utc": 1550698607, "title": "Just want to get my thoughts out.", "author": "rennoll", "self_text": "Hey, guys I just found this subreddit and it's reassuring to find people that feel the same way I do. I've been keeping my thoughts to myself and have never shared them with anyone before but I just hate bottling everything up.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm a 26 y/o male Asian American male living in the US. I have never so much as held hands romantically with someone of the fairer sex let alone been in a relationship. I don't even have anyone that I can consider a friend; I only have acquaintances. I am currently 3000 miles away from any family. I just had my birthday recently which made me wonder where it all went wrong. How did my life turn out like this?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThinking back, the happiest point of my life was during elementary school. I was full of energy. I could talk freely to my peers. More importantly, I had friends. I guess the first sign of things going down hill was when I hit puberty. I was a chubby kid and never gave it a second thought but I started becoming really self conscious when I started middle school. I always avoided having attention drawn to me. My daily routine throughout middle and high school was to attend school and then head straight home because that was where I felt the most comfortable. At home, nobody will make fun of you. To make things worse, I had major problems with acne, which I still suffer with to this day. This had left me with numerous scars on my face. I've went through 2 courses of Accutane, which is the last resort drug used to treat acne, a few years ago only to have my acne return and leaving me with weakened joints. It doesn't help that I am the only one in my family to have acne problems this bad. Everywhere I look, people have clear, beautiful skin. Everywhere I look, I see attractive people. I hate waking up every morning and looking at myself in the mirror. All I see is an ugly, miserable shell of a person.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI tried to hang out with the friends I had during elementary school but I realized how much I didn't fit in. Everyone had different interests than me and I just felt like they were keeping me in the group due to kindness. By senior year of high school, I have complete dissociated myself from them. I guess the only person that I can truly call my friend was my brother but he too started developing different interests than me and we were no longer joined at the hip like we were during our childhood years. I guess my classmates realized how much of a loser I am and I was picked on through high school. Kids are cruel. I suffered through high school, thinking that things will be better in college.\n\nIn college, things were no different. I couldn't relate to anyone and kept up my old habits. I made friends with a few of my classmates but it became bothersome trying to be someone who I was not. By my sophomore year I was alone again. I thought that I would be able to meet that special someone but everyone seemed to be in a relationship already. Even if I had met someone who was single, who would want to go out with a freak like me?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI graduated unceremoniously and lived at home, working a full time job at a retail store. Everyone I knew was doing something with their lives and here I was, wasting the prime of my life doing absolutely nothing. I would be lying if I said that there weren't times where I wished that I was never born. After two years of meandering, I decided that I needed to move on with my life. I applied to graduate school and was accepted to a school across the country. I thought that finally moving out of my parents' house would bring about a positive change to my life and so I said my good byes to my family last summer and moved.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLiving away from my family for the first time was a blast. I had so much freedom and I felt happy for the first time since my childhood. I was excited to see how my classmates were like but meeting them only made me realize how much of a failure I was. Everyone at this point was in a serious relationship or already had a family already and here I was, a virgin loser. Yet again, I became the \"quiet\" kid and I resigned myself to that role. I did not realize how lonely I was until I went back to visit my family for winter break. My family was the only support I had. On my first day back from vacation I broke down in tears. However, I steeled myself and moved on.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI will be graduating in a year and this brings me to where I am today. Everyday, I think about how my life will be when I graduate and have a stable income. I want to have a family but I'm afraid that I will never find that special someone. Being an Asian in a White majority country, I have always felt like an outcast. It also doesn't help that my idea of a soulmate lines up with more traditional values, which Americans have moved away from. I have been toying with the idea of taking my chances and taking a long vacation to Asia and try to find someone there, but for now I will continue studying hard. I'll try to make my parents proud.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThank you for reading and sorry if my thoughts seemed disorganized. I just typed whatever came to my mind. It felt really good to type that all out. If you're into anime or bicycling and would like to be friends with a loser like me, please let me know.", "subreddit": "ForeverAlone"}

Sometimes I do have moments of sadness and loneliness though and think back to old friends from high school, or college... I can easily look on Facebook or Instagram to see what they\u2019re up to but I never really talk to them anymore, and they never talk to me anymore either.\n\nToday something happened though. I was reading a random Reddit thread about friends who aren\u2019t really your friends.. one thing someone mentioned was how they didn\u2019t use their phone for a month and when they turned their phone back on they saw nobody texted them. It made me decide to take a look through my texts. I have plenty of texts from my family, everyone in it actually. Which I appreciate more now. Because I looked all the way back through my messages and the last time that a friend messaged me was January 2018.\n\nIt\u2019s pretty insane to consider. Obviously part of the reason I\u2019m not getting messages from people anymore is because I\u2019m not messaging them, but this is after years of disconnecting from \u201cfriends\u201d and practically getting used to the lonely silence. I realized years back how so many people I thought were friends weren\u2019t really my friends since they weren\u2019t there for me when I had a very difficult time but now I realize that I straight up don\u2019t have any friends (except my girlfriend), none at all. \n\nI could always message someone I had a friendship with in the past and I\u2019m sure they\u2019d be happy to talk but for an entire year now, no one outside of my family even cared enough to ask how I was doing, or congratulate me on the new job. It really makes you wonder. At least I don\u2019t feel crazy anymore for feeling lonely. I actually don\u2019t have other people outside of family and my relationship who care for me. All I can do from here is use this as a learning experience and try to build stronger friendships in the future, and not count on flaky friendships to get me through life.\n\nFor now I have a lot of plans ahead. Going to continue going strong with work, try and work each day to be healthier, enjoy the time I have and play games and explore, and if I can just continue working on it, complete the novel I\u2019ve had in mind for years and am slowly making my way through.\n\nI am interested in hearing from you all and hope that you have a really nice night if you\u2019re reading this. :)", "subreddit": "lonely"}

I'm talking getting a dog(s) to alleviate feelings of loneliness, despair, and worthlessness. Now, before you dog on me (pun not intended) about such an idea being so terrible and generic hear me out. To start off, dogs give you something to do all the time. This may be a double edged sword but in reality the blessing of being occupied with a purposefull thing to do cannot be underestimated. Carl Jung once stated \"...meaning makes a great many things endurable, perhaps everything.\" Along with this, dogs always look at you with love and admiration, no matter what. No matter you are ugly, unintelligent, socially impaired it does not matter. You will always be the highlight of your dogs life, everytime you walk in that door they are thrilled to see you. Owning a dog gives you motivation to get out and walk it, which is also a plus. They provide protection and solace while you sleep which is great if you have anxiety disorders. I know there probably will be some replies along the line of \"getting attention from an animal means nothing\" or \"that doesn't change the fact that I'm a FA\". To the first I say that is false, and  the companionship of an animal may be the only form of relief people get in bad situation or state of mind. To the second I say it may not, but at least you truly are not alone and have a loving companion.  A dog truly is the companion you have when no one else is there. Give me some hate down there I don't care I just genuinely think those without a dog would benefit from the companionship. Kinda baked so sorry for any errors in my writing and truly if you despise me so much as a person after reading about the companionship of dogs then leave it down below I'll get to reading them.", "subreddit": "ForeverAlone"}

I was a small kid based on some of my photos from childhood, but apparently that lasted for an extremely short while due to my bad eating habits.  When I was growing up,  I was always the fat kid that everyone wanted to pick on, the person who people would never give any real attention to, the person that would always be picked last for group events, and overall, the person that people would rather not be around if they had alternatives. \n\n\n\n\nSo, as you can imagine, my social and love life were pretty nonexistent.  And at 24 years old, that's still the case, even moreso now as I grow older and become more isolated.  However, during my junior year of high school, I decided that I wanted to lose weight.  I began to diet, I exercised, and I even started paying more attention to my lack of fashion sense.  That dedication did a lot of good for me back then. \n\n\n\n\nBy the time my senior year of high school came around, I was at the best point I had ever been in my life physically. I wasn't rocking a 6 pack or muscles, but I felt absolutely amazing.  I was finally able to wear just large and medium shirts, my waist size had dropped, I was more capable of working out, and the best part of it all, people started to pay more attention to me. Unfortunately, experiencing this new world was the problem........ \n\n\n\n\nI've always been shy, quiet, and very introverted.  And before I had lost weight, those parts of my personality had become even more pronounced because of the way I had been treated by others growing up.  When I began my senior year of high school, people were praising me left and right. \"Oh my god, Keylo you're so skinny now!\",  \"Wow! I can't believe that's you!\".  People would go out of their way to talk to me more, I was more inclusive within other groups of people, and I'd even have people flirting with me a bit. \n\n\n\n\n\nDespite the fact that I was finally being positively received by other people for the first time in my life, the internal damage had already been done.   Even though I may as well have been a new person, internally I was still that insecure fat kid that was hyper aware of all of his flaws. I didn't know if people were being genuine with me, and even if they were, in my mind it was like \"I can't believe I had to drop a few pounds just for you to treat me like a human being\".  It all just seemed so shallow to me. \n\n\n\n\nAt that point, none of the changes I had made for myself did any real good, because I still ended up being unhappy and unable to bring myself to be around other people.  Now, at 24 years old, I've gained a lot of weight back, I've fallen back into some of my unhealthy habits, and I'm even more introverted than ever.  Every now and then I still think to myself, \"Man, I wish I was attractive, in a relationship, or had a close group of friends\", because I think that it might solve a lot of my problems. But when I look back at my high school experience, I just remember that it still wouldn't do me any good.  \ud83d\ude14\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLife probably changes for the better with other people who work on themselves, but for me, that wasn't the case, and sadly I don't think it will ever be the case.  The realities between those worlds are just too different, and sometimes I don't think we're properly prepared to deal with them. \n\n\n\n\n**TL;DR- I was unattractive, became attractive, couldn't make friends or get into a relationship because I still felt unattractive inside, and have continued to exist in a state of FAness ever since.** ", "subreddit": "ForeverAlone"}

Are there some societal norms that really play off our biggest fears and make us feel FA?  \n\n\nFor instance, I recently saw a post on another reddit where someone asked a few pointed questions and the answers were often telling to me.  Like who usually gets more compliments males or females?  the consensus showed that females quite often get more compliments.  Arguments ensued discussing whether this is because females felt men were more emotionally closed off, in general, or whether females are just more selective, which basically makes those who are FA have to fight that much more to find a person to connect with.  Are there any other examples of this inequality?  Is this a fair assessment?    \n\n\n&amp;#x200B;", "subreddit": "ForeverAlone"}

I don't want to wait any longer to find \"the one\" but maybe it's clinging to that ideology that's harming me in the long run.\n\nIt's kind of silly to even think about things like that, but I don't know. I'm starting to think recently all this is just me trying to cope with how....empty I guess? I feel without that kind of driving romance to really keep me happy. Sure, I've got things that make me happy, and I have lots of friends and people I'm close to and I'm not really *alone*, but I feel alone. I just keep wondering when, if ever, that I'm going to fall in love again, because I just feel empty without it. And dating sites feel...awkward I guess? Mostly because I haven't really found much success, if any, so it makes me a little self-conscious that I'm just kind of undesirable. I'm sure that's not the case, but it's just kinda gut wrenching. Silly, I know, but whatever.\n\nMaybe it's just because I felt like I could always talk to her, when I was with her. She was always someone I talked to, so I guess that's part of why I feel this way right now. It's my first big breakup so I guess I'm just feeling the burn hard. Dawning on it though, it also made me realize I just wanted someone who listened to me.\n\nEven though she was always available to talk late into our relationship she started to detest the things I'd do. I'd take maybe like, an hour or so (not that long) to play a game and she'd get furious that I hadn't messaged her in that long. She said she had issues with it in past relationships but after a while it felt like she was just getting on my case very quickly and suddenly. I'm getting a bit off topic, but my point is I'm probably just looking for something that feels good for once.\n\nSomeone that actually cares about my interests and doesn't think they're dumb or stupid and tries to get me to like her things instead. Someone that's actually willing to listen and like...I guess *try* to keep the relationship together? It always felt like I was the one trying to mend arguments back together, and not the other way around. I'm trying to find ways to word this that don't make me look like a complete asshole, so I hope the point gets across.\n\nI've never really had someone that wanted to get to know me more, I guess. It never felt like she wanted me to open up to her, to talk about things with her too much. Early on in our relationship sure, but I honestly felt her getting frustrated with me later on. Especially when we'd do calls and she'd say that I talk way too much and it kind of stung a lot. I do talk a lot but it's just because I think a lot, and I like talking about those things because it's just kind of satisfying to get them out in the open.\n\nI got a bit off topic from my original intent, but getting it out of my head helps me understand the picture a little more, I guess. I'm just kind of lonely for love, especially because it's closing up on a year since we broke up somewhat soon. I haven't really met anyone since then, and I'm just a little concerned that she was it, she was the last person I'll ever have a relationship with, and I really wish I didn't worry about this so much. It's so minor, and I probably have bigger things to worry about, but I'm just worrying about things like this instead. \n\nI just kind of wish I wouldn't worry so much about trying to meet that \"one\" person, and worrying so much about all of these things. It really makes me feel ridiculous, because I just kind of feel like I'm a bit in over myself and that all this worrying is just me being dumb and I have to wait to find that one person. But the wait is killing me, and I don't really know what to do. I keep thinking that I have to start meeting people, that it's because I'm so passive about the whole thing, about not really forcing it just so I don't make myself even more upset by jumping into a relationship head first because I think it'll make me happy (when it really doesn't) that I'm not really finding anyone or something like that. It makes me think about like, 30 different outcomes. I'll sit here worrying \"are my interests too out there for people to really get interested? Are they too specific, too choosy, am I just not really a viable choice for anyone\", etc. They're really, really stupid thoughts, but I can't help but have them run through my head.\n\nAgain, sorry for rambling on a bit. Just kinda sucks. I already feel a bit better getting it out in the open though so that's something.", "subreddit": "lonely"}

I'm talking about the ones in Nevada where prostitution is legal and the women are from what I read, well taken care of. \n\nIt's another lonely Friday Night for me and I'm reading about these places in Nevada that you can go to and have a legal, girlfriend, experience. You take her on a date if you want and then have sex with her. This is part of why I hate being poor. It's not an option for me. If I had the money, I would go to Nevada and lose my virginity to one of the women there. Even at my age people tell me how I shouldn't lose my virginity to a prostitute but once you get into your mid 30's, you realize that's the only sex you will ever get to have. \n\nI think about taking her out to dinner and her acting like she's interested even if she isn't. She wouldn't call me ugly or creepy. She obviously isn't going to ghost on me. Despite it being artificial, I would know I was going to have sex with her. I would pay for the girlfriend experience so that's why I would want to go out to dinner with her. \n\nOne of my fears with an escort is with the girlfriend experience, since a woman has never touched me in that way, I could suspend my disbelief enough to believing a woman is actually choosing to put her arms around me. I guess they are like the professional wrestling of sex. It may not be real but if you can suspend your disbelief for a couple of hours, you may actually like the experience. If I am able to suspend my disbelief, the feeling of a woman putting her arm around me alone would cause me to become very emotional. All of those years of rejection would come out in some kind of emotional moment. I wonder if escorts commonly have FA guys start to cry before the sex even happens due to being touched when nobody else would touch them. I could see myself wanting to talk with her more than have sex, and becoming emotional at her touching me. I would still want to see a legal prostitute or escort. Europe is too far away. Nevada is also far away but not as far. It would be an interesting experience to see one of these women.\n\nWhat do you think about escorts? I'm not talking about the type of women who are illegally trafficked into being prostitutes but escorts in areas where prostitution is legal. You know the women are being treated well. You just want the experience of a girlfriend that isn't from a woman on Youtube. If any of you in The US especially since it's only legal in Nevada have the money or would have the money, would you travel to lose your virginity? ", "subreddit": "ForeverAlone"}

I may be a lot younger than many of you, but I am going through the same. Everyone in college seems to have those one or two best friends who do everything with them, who make them feel loved and cared for. Now I have a lot of friends, but I don't think any of them care about me as much as I do. I don't get invited for any social event or parties, the only time people need me is when they need help with homework or someone to organize a game. No one has ever asked me to join them for food, or to a party. And that even goes to the Minecraft server I play on. There are a lot of teams and while everyone is friendly to me, no one accepts me to join them. Yes, I know Minecraft is completely different from real life, and these friendships may not be real, but they still make me feel lonely.\n\nWhile I have struggled to admit it, I have low key been craving for attention from at least one person, who would be like a best friend to me, who would care about me as much as I did about them. I try to put up stories/posts on my social media sites, but no replies or likes. This took me to Tinder, but since I am not the best looking person, I didn't get any matches. Furthermore, I am not everyone's type. People have told me I am a much better person than I look like. But they're either being nice, or I look so bad that anything is better. I know they aren't serious because they don't really take the initiative to call me to hang out. Yes, I do call people myself, but they are always \"busy with work\" (while their story five minutes later is just of them having a good time).\n\nIt got to the point that I posted on [r/ForeverAloneDating](https://www.reddit.com/r/ForeverAloneDating) from a throwaway. While it might help, I am super worried. What if I become one of those people who spams other people's inbox in the hope of attention? Not sexual attention (see: first line), but it could still be seen as super annoying! I hate those people so much. But for some reason I relate to them a little bit and that bothers me. Or what if I take the path of doing drugs or drinking to take my mind off my loneliness? I know people who tells me it gives them peace of mind, at least temporarily. Maybe it could help me get into a group of such people, it's almost the norm here. Who knows? I am super worried. Right now, in an at least somewhat stable mindset, I know that I do not want to go down either of those paths. But I have never felt this close to, what I would call the dark side, ever before. I nearly invited myself to a party last week, just to try and get a distraction. Luckily, my logic and sickness kicked in and stopped me from going.\n\nIf any of you have tips, now is the time.

{"post_id": "attvly", "created_utc": 1550915644, "title": "I spent the last year going out socializing, drinking at bars, and clubbing, here's what I learned.", "author": "Eclecto1", "self_text": "First of all a little backstory. I'm 25 years old, I spent all my middle/highschool and college years avoiding social situations due to social anxiety and just played video games. I had my first kiss out of college at 23 (she must have felt bad for me because we stopped talking after that), lost my virginity to a prostitute at 24, and I just recently turned 25. I got really sad at first for months after my first kiss and couldn't do anything and just sat in my room all day. I was very depressed and suicidal. I realized that the world doesn't care about you. One day I  got extremely angry. It felt a lot better than being sad. I was actually able to do things, to leave the house, go to the store, etc... I started walking around punching things like the wall and light posts (sounds crazy I know but I was in such a bad spot at the time). Eventually I said fuck it and joined a small gym. I chose planet fitness because of their 24 hours. Due to social anxiety I had a really difficult time going at first, so I went at 2 in the morning every day. Even  when the gym was mostly empty, I still had anxiety, so to get  myself hyped up I got really angry. I also started to develop a \"I don't give a fuck mentality\", and I thought to myself, fuck whoever is going to judge me. I learned quickly that being sad was detrimental to my health, so whenever I felt sad and sorry for myself I would get angry instead. I hated myself, I hated my anxiety, I was depressed, and I was tired of it. Anyways, first couple of weeks I meet this guy at the gym. He approaches me, we start talking, and eventually we become decent friends. This guy was an extreme extrovert, he approached anyone without a single fuck in the world. Anyways, he invited me out and I went. The first couple of months of going out with this guy I would just observe him and follow his lead. It was crazy, this whole thing was new to me, it was like a different world. I never hid behind him, he just made the decisions and I followed. I learned a lot, and it took me months before my anxiety was low enough that I could approach people and have conversations with people by myself. He was like a crutch, or even training wheels. Another couple of months went by and I was getting better at this whole socializing thing. It's really like anything else, you need to practice it to get better, and you will fuck up a lot, it's normal. Eventually it got to the point were I can go to bars alone, sit at the bar top or walk around and just talk to people. This was the biggest achievement for me. My social anxiety and social skills got a lot better. To cut the story short, after a year of doing this, I managed to hookup with 3 girls, and had 2 other potential girlfriends that I messed it up with because I was inexperienced. I'm still depressed, I still have anxiety, and I still don't have a girlfriend, but it's some progress at least.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSome things I learned along the way on this anxiety infested journey. \n\nHere's the deal, I'm not going to sugarcoat any of this. Everything I say here is my opinion which comes from my experiences.\n\n1. First of all, I learned you have to stop feeling sorry for yourself, because this world is a fucked up place, and no one cares about our feelings. Seriously, the more you feel sorry for yourself the worse it gets. I still do it, but then I go back to my roots. I get angry instead, go to the gym, take my anger out on the weights. It's not the healthiest of ways obviously, but it is still better than feeling sad because when I feel sad I feel crippled and can't do anything. In our society, when a girl is sad and depressed she's \"cute\" and you want to hug her and make her feel better. When a guy is sad and depressed he's a little bitch.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n2. Whatever your brain tells you to do, do the exact opposite. I still get anxiety before the gym (although not as bad as before), but I usually think about, realize that it isn't real and it's just in my head, and go do it. My brain is telling me don't go, people will judge you, I tell my brain to go fuck itself. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n3. No one will cure you, no one will save you, no one will change your life except you. Here's the deal, if you want a girlfriend/boyfriend/friends, you have to go find her/him/them, end of story. They will not appear out of thin air. Yes you should focus on yourself, but you will not find these people sitting in bed all day.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n4. Everyone on this subreddit thinks they're ugly, well I got news for you. YOU'RE NOT AS UGLY AS YOU THINK. Yes it's mostly about looks, yes good looking people have it way easier. But this is the fucked up world we live in. It's not fair and it will never be. IF YOU AS AN INDIVIDUAL WANT TO FIND A MATE and you're ugly, instead of approaching 10 girls you have to approach 100. Like I said, it's a fucked up world, but we gotta deal with this shit, and no point in feeling sorry for ourselves because it's not going to change anything. The world isn't a fairy tale like you see in Disney movies. There is no soul mate and there is no \"love at first sight\". It's even worse for shy guys (like I was, even though I still kinda am).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n5. THERE IS NOTHING WRONG WITH YOU, SOCIALLY, MENTALLY, OR PHYSICALLY. Seriously, this was the biggest thing for me when first going out to converse with people. I automatically thought they were better than me, but a lot of them were not what I had anticipated. Lots of them were weird, dorky, goofy, even awkward. It was just my mind and it's self depreciating nature. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\ntl;dr\n\n25 years old, socially anxious and awkward, started going out to improve social anxiety and social skills, managed to have some success in the dating world. Less anxious and depressed nowadays, am more comfortable with myself. I left some tips from my perspective. Take them with a grain of salt, everyone is different and has different experiences. \n\n&amp;#x200B;", "subreddit": "ForeverAlone"}

This is the story of my struggle with loneliness, stress and myself as well. I try to make it as short as possible. Some advice would be nice, maybe a comment... Actually, I would be grateful if someone took the time to read it (maybe I am not the only one in this situation).\n\nDELUSION \nI am male, nineteen, european (let\u2018s leave it at that) and gay (I do not need any lecturing on that point but this will be part of the problem). I had a dream to become a doctor. I applied for medical school and got accepted to a very good university (high in rankings and public so no student loans ;-)), which is far away from my home in the countryside. So I moved. I had hopes, was certain I would find new friends and could keep mine at home. Everything seemed perfect maybe I could even finally find love, which has not been easy due to increased levels of homophobia in the countryside. The city seemed to be made just for me.\n\nSTANDARDS\nI had high standards... maybe to high. You see, I really appreciated my friends back home. They knew about my sexuality, gave me advice and encouraged me. We were not the popular ones but we partied, we went to malls (typical teen-sh*t) but also loved to visit sights of interest or museums. The most important aspect of our friendship was that we held to each other no matter what. We fought each others fights, were truthful to each other and even tried to lighten up the mood of unhappy and lonely people by opening our doors and inviting them.\n\nIMPRESSION \nSomehow I expected a similar group to form. At least I thought the idea was great. The idea of recreating what I had... Maybe even better. My dreams were shattered even before the first lecture this October began. Meeting the first colleagues of mine was quite a shock. They were not as spontaneous and open-minded as I thought. In fact a lot of them were so concerned about their appearance, their grades...Ugh... I can\u2018t even describe... you know what kind of people I mean...\u201cWell\u201c, I thaught, \u201eat least I have the weekends with my real friends\u201c.\n\nDOWNFALL\nNo, actually not. Because of studying I had to stay in the city for a lot of the time. Buried under grey concrete and the loud, egoistic way of life here. I found a good friend (female) but that was IT. Nobody else could be bothered even to look at me. I have had courage, I have asked them if they wanted to do something, studying, cinema, museum, ANYTHING. But no one had \u201etime\u201c for me. A lot of them now look away when they see me, maybe laugh at the lonely guy behind my back or hurtfully in front of my face. It breaks my heart that I am failing at this now. I was nice to them, humorous even, so I thought it had something to do with my appearance (I am tall, have brown hair, not athletic but neither completely skinny). Hence, I had it all redone: Had a haircut, wore other clothes, used a different parfume. Did not work... of course. My self-esteem is so low now, I cannot even look into the mirror. \n\nHUMILIATION\nSo I am becoming less open by the second. A lot of people now ask me wether I have a girlfriend, grinning at me, wanting to hear that eminent \u201eno I don\u2018t\u201c. Inside I am screaming: \u201eLeave me alone I don\u2018t WANT a bloody girlfriend\u201c, but I am just not strong enough to do that anymore. I even tried to open up to an acquaintance in the train. Open up about everything. She walked out and has not really talked to me since then. Hurtful. You see another problem that comes with being gay is, that you don\u2018t feel as comfortable with guy-friends as girl-friends. However, you will never completely be a girl in a girl\u2018s eyes and neither are you a real guy. It is miserable. I wish that I could just out myself completely but I don\u2018t feel ready to \u201edisappoint\u201c my parents like that. I have given up on love completely. I had some internet contact with other guys but everything about that seemed horrible to me.\n\nMEMORY\nSo back to friendship, back to my countryside-friends... at least to what was left. They seemed to get along very well without me, doing exactly the same things, having the time of their lives. Some of them even went to dates regularly, talking about them afterwards... of course not talking with me... someone who has no idea about anything romantic. Sometimes when they are drunk while I am lying in bed they call me and tell me that they miss me and ask how I am doing. \u201eAs always, fine\u201c, I respond and my night is ruined. I wonder how long they will keep calling me. I wonder when I will be forgotten.\n\nREFLECTION \nMy identity is broken, gone. I used to be the one to invite others in. Now I am here not getting a single invitation. I used to be a warrior, fighting for my ideals, writing essays and discussing fiercely. Now I rather shut my mouth. I used to laugh, cherish life... I used to be happy. Now I do not even dare to open the door when somebody else of my student dormitory is in the hallway. Rejection after rejection while everybody at home seems to do at least as fine as when I was around. I don\u2018t recognize myself anymore, feel numb, ready to die alone (can\u2018t even cry while writing this). \n\nI was used to being picked last into a team. Now I am not picked at all.

She wasn't very charismatic, she mostly just sat alone, and she loved to self-deprecate. She's gay so there was no point in trying anything (not like I would either way because I'm a pussy), she wasn't the only one however. My ex-girlfriend used to self-harm too, and she went really fucking deep, we were together because we were going through the exact same thing at the exact same time, eventually though she ended up getting worse so we had no choice but to break things off, I have no idea where she is now.\n\nIs it wrong to be attracted to someone who's mentally ill because they're mentally ill?

I\u2019m currently writing this in one of the schools bathroom stalls, since I was just about having a small little mental breakdown. Everybody else seems to be having a lot of fun, but all I\u2019m feeling is lonely. I came with my two best friends, and they already found dance partners. I was going to ask someone to dance, but I couldn\u2019t make the courage to ask, and when I was about to, she was already walking away. What does everyone else have that I don\u2019t?\n\nNow, I\u2019m usually not that sad of a guy. I know I have friends, and I have a group that I hang out with regularly.

I mean, it\u2019s not like I don\u2019t do it either, I talk to some people over snap a lot, but they do it religiously, and then rub it in my face that I don\u2019t talk to as many girls as they do. They even compare my snap score to theirs. They make me feel obsolete and inferior, like I\u2019m not how a normal teenage boy is supposed to act like.

I'm not saying anyone isn't FA. What I am saying is that we have more teenage posters than people 30 or over. \n\nWhen I read a post especially by an outsider who is usually much younger than me giving advice that I tried but failed, I get very bitter because I think they are assuming I didn't try. In some cases that is true but in most cases, the advice isn't for me. It's for the younger members that are half my age. I have to stop being so defensive and bitter but I get very defensive when outsiders post advice. The same advice while useless to me, could help the 18 year old who still has a chance. I realized I am being selfish when I get angry at the advice. Sure, some of the advice is so generic it's meme advice, but it could actually be good advice for the 18 year old poster who is going off to college or even a 16 year old that feels like they will become FA. That 16 year old still has time to try and change. I'm not saying they can escape becoming FA, but they shouldn't give up so young. Telling an 18 year old to try to interact with people could actually help them. After college it becomes extremely difficult to interact with people. A large number of posters still have time.\n\nI know there is a sub for people over 30 but it's dead compared to the main sub. When you get to my age, and are still FA, you start to accept that you will never escape FA. You start realize the only way you will have sex is by paying for it. There is no happy ending for you. Unless your name is Robert Kraft.

It's like seeing a commercial for the Lifetime Channel movie of the week. While I see the commercial, it's not targeted at me.

Not only am I shy and terrified of the thought of even asking a girl out, I don't even know if I'm even ready for love in the first place. I know I want it, I dream of it... but I make no effort to go out and get it because as an overweight, socially anxious person who suffers from mild Asperger's syndrome and an on-and-off stammer, I don't think I even have the slightest chance of acquiring love. Hell, I can barely even make friends for a start; I made a couple of minor ones last year, but I rarely see them because like many people they have their own personal lives and other social circles.\n\nMaking matters worse? I still live at home, have no job and can't drive due to driving anxieties that prevented me from ever being able to take a driving test (forcing me to give up lessons and accept that I've not mentally well enough to drive). So those three things make things even harder.\n\nOh, and I have a small penis as well. Not micro, but small. It's like I ended up with the worst of everything.\n\nSo because of all this stuff I truly do not know whether I'm ready for love or whether I will be ready. And even when I get employed, make a few more friends, perhaps move out... then what? Where do you go to meet girls? How do you develop a crush? How do you not come across as creepy when introducing yourself? How do you ask if someone is single without sounding like a pervert? Are you meant to apologise if you accidentally offend them? The sheer number of questions I have when it comes to love are immense.\n\nWhen I was a kid, I really loved 1960s love songs, especially Tamla Motown stuff, but the downside was that so many love songs from back then are about heartbreak or not being ready, and they ring so true. For me, they ring even more true; love is such a difficult thing. Personally, it would be a great thing to teach kids in schools - \"Love\" lessons involving roleplay, where everyone pretends to be BF/GF (or BF/BF and GF/GF) so that people can get the experience before heading into the real thing. Sure, school touched upon this stuff a bit, but not enough, thus leaving so many people like me unprepared, unknowledgeable and scared.\n\nAnyone else like me - i.e. not just \"forever alone\" but also \"forever unsure of how to even get started\"?", "subreddit": "ForeverAlone"}

There have to be the 0.1% of people who are unattractive to 99.9% of people. Despite what people clinging to the just world fallacy want to think, ugly people exist. If you are ugly, trying to approach people isn't a good idea. I'm not saying anyone on here is ugly. This is hypothetical. Since guys do most of the approaching, if an ugly guy is going out approaching women, I don't care how much game you have. PUA scam artists will try to convince you otherwise, but if you are ugly, she is not going to be interested. At best you would be considered a candidate for a disposable, platonic, friend. If she finds your advances as a threat, you could get insulted, slapped, thrown out of the establishment you are in, get in legal trouble, or you could get your ass kicked. \n\nAnother fallacy is that the only people who are ugly are people with deformities. That's not true. People with deformities are not on the 1-10 scale. Moe said it best. Some people aren't any kind of ugly. They are just ugly ugly. People need to stop being in denial and thinking the only ugly people are people with ugly personalities because most of us have seen people with ugly personalities do well with relationships. While I don't have any advice for ugly people, I'm not going to lie and say you aren't ugly but getting a haircut while lifting in the shower is going to help you find someone. You could get jacked, have the best haircut, the best therapist, and the best treadmill. It doesn't matter. Getting jacked is good for your health and should still be encouraged. If you are ugly, you are still ugly no matter what you do. \n\nI'm not saying it's hopeless for all ugly people. You probably have seen people you found ugly in relationships. There is that 0.1% of people who would find you attractive and some people are lucky enough to meet one or more of those people.

My friend was confident I'd find someone, she told me I'd \"charm the pants off them\".\n\n I went into hoping to have a few dates, I didn't see myself as ugly and I felt once I got over the nerves my charisma would take over... and it did. Or so I thought. Out of 20 ladies, I felt I had 5 strong possibilities, I was worried whether to tick yes to two who were friends or just tick one - I didn't want them falling out. I actually had that conversation in my head - like I had a choice haha!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe night ended really well,  my last date was with a girl called Nina. She said she really liked me, and we arranged to go on a date to a leisure park. She told me to contact her via the site once we'd matched. The next morning, I checked out the ticket prices and then entered my marks. I ticked five yes, 14 friend and one no (who was really rude to me).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe problem with the site (and many others) is it tells who ticked you and who didn't - some actually do it in a graph format. By the evening, everyone had entered their results. In graph format (so the first column, \"yes\", second \"friend\" and third \"no\"), I saw how everyone had entered their choices. All 25 selected no. 100% no.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI was gutted about Nina. I befriended a guy from the event who we'll call John - he friend matched with her and she sent him a message along the lines of, \"You were the only guy worth ticking friend for\" - I felt mislead and confused.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNevertheless, I went the following Saturday and befriended three more guys. We had a night out with some of the girls there. I was really optimistic about one, who I'd spent a lot of time talking to on the night out and I felt I had connected with. The results came in (this time in email format) - \"Sorry you have no matches, sorry no other girl expressed an interest in you\" essentially meaning I had 100% no again. The guys i befriended all had numerous matches - which made me feel more unattractive.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI started working out and got in shape - real good shape (three years later - I wish I was in that shape now), and I continued going speed dating with the three guys I met as none of their matches materialised into anything. I continued to get zero likes.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOne night in particular stands out - I just had a great time and felt (without trying) I was the best version of myself. I really got on with everyone and I felt charismatic. I got 0 likes again. A few weeks later, I bumped into two ladies from that night. They said they hated my friend and really liked me but didn't feel we had that spark. They asked if I had any matches and i told them I had no likes and they were surprised. I said my friend who they hated had six matches. They told me, \"It won't always be like that and your turn will come\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnother month passed, another speed dating event came and this one was the most brutal. Not because it was awkward but because I really connected with a lady, whom we'll call Amy. She was awesome, we lived near each other, shared similar interests... There were two stairways at the venue. Afterwards, I used the back staircase to go to the toilet.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI came back up and Amy and her friend, we'll call her Sophie, were talking as they headed towards the other staircase. They did not know I was behind them. The conversation went like this (we'll call myself James and my friend Funaki for the lols)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAmy: Out of them all, I got on with James the best... But I just don't... you know, fancy him, physically.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSophie: What about Funaki?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAmy: He was a nob but I fancied him... \\*\\*\\*IT'S A SHAME JAMES COULDN'T LOOK LIKE FUNAKI. I KNOW IT SOUNDS BAD, BUT IF I JUST DON'T FIND HIM ATTRACTIVE. IF HE WAS JUST A BIT BETTER LOOKING, I'D DATE HIM\\*\\*\\* Do you think I'm shallow?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSophie: Yes\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAmy: Did you tick him?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA pause (meaning Sophie did not tick me)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAmy: See.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm paraphrasing and going by memory but the part in capitals killed me inside. Needless to say, I ended up with zero likes. I walked home and started to feel as if I wasn't physically attractive enough. I think internally, I lost hope.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI didn't want to go speed dating again but Funaki persuaded me to go. He said he wanted to help find me someone but in reality he wanted a backup plan for Amy - we went speed dating 5 times in eight days leading up to their date. Yes, five times in EIGHT DAYS. Needless to say, I got 0 likes in each event with various speed dating companies.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAt this point i became demoralised but the events have a way of luring you in - if you get no matches, they either offer you a free event or a heavily discounted ticket. Before I knew it, I'd done over 30 and worked out I'd paid for the equivalent of six events. On three occasions, even when I was out of free events, I'd get a phone call or text asking me to attend for free as they were short of men, rather than cancelling the event for lack of men and having to refund the women who had paid up, they offered free places. One guy once told me they paid him a tenna to attend. I believe him.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n(Side note - it seems men book last minute, women book in advance. Usually there's more men that women but in the days leading up to an event, the organisers get twichy as they are usually short of men until there's a mad rush!)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnyway, Over two tragic years. I went speed dating 50+ times\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy results were:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n1 like (she also ticked \"yes\" to my other 4 friends)\n\n1 friend (she ticked \"yes\" to my other 4 friends and \"friend\" to me)\n\nThe rest are nos with some unknown (as some companies don't tell you how many likes you got or whether someone you didn't tick liked you - which I think IS the best way)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSometimes, I would find it hard to believe nobody else liked me. I even wondered whether the companies withhold likes to get you to go again. By the law of probabilities, you would expect a couple more to tick or select yes by mistake! I emailed one company regarding this and they assured me the results are accurate.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnyway after a 15 month  break, I went speed dating on Valentines Day. I felt i'd grown as a person, I'd taken lessons to help project my voice better, I felt confident, i'd improved my posture, meditated, I now feel that I have worth as human being (which I lost)... and then came the results - 0 likes.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm not the only one, one guy has been at most events since day one - he tells me he's never had a like. I believe him as  I  he lacks social skills and charisma. I went to drama school in my youth, I captained a soccer team so I feel I have skills that should see me doing better yet i'm in the same boat as him, I've not had a date.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTinder is a fail, POF is a fail, Bumble, OKCupid, Match, Zoosk, Match Affinity etc - i've tried it all and then on Bumble and Tinder, I did a one hour experiment and changed my profile picture to a friends to see if I got different results. I got lots of matches on both, then deleted Tinder and Bumble and never used it again. The only logical conclusion is that i'm not physically attractive enough for anyone to want to date me, and therefore I am a lost cause.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe second worse thing anyone has ever said to me speed dating is, \"Fuck off, your hair is shit, you're going bald\" -- On a side note regarding that incident, it happened on a Saturday. People often use it as a precursor to a night out, they get hammered and Saturday events often become toxic compared to weekday events, where everyone is less drunk and more respectful.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSadly, I don't think think personality matters too much. I remember a guy (I'll call him Steve) from a social event I attended - a group of us  (three girls, me and Steve) came across this guy who had banged his head on the pavement, blood was streaming from it and he was unconscious. Steve told the girls to leave him, they followed him. I stayed and rung an ambulance. I thought it was a shit thing to do... I bumped into him speed dating - he's a good looking guy and was getting a lot of attention. However, personality wise he's ugly inside. Not just cause of that one incident but other incidents as well, such as mocking a disabled guy etc. I think with him, it's a combination of looks and confidence.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHowever, I don't feel as confidence matters too much. I've seen good looking guys who lack confidence go speed dating and women tend to find them endearing. A not so good looking guy who lacks confidence is found repulsive.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe end.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nPhew - I just needed to get that off my chest. There is a logical side of me that believes nobody will ever find me attractive.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI dunno where I go from here - it's really hard to accept. I'm going to lay low for a while, recharge myself. Keep discovering myself as a person, follow other dreams, take care of myself and let mother nature heal the wounds that have opened up.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nP.S. In total, I went speed dating with a 6 friends during those three years - we all knew each other and met through speed dating. 2 of them met someone and got engaged through it. So it's not all bad! I mean the guy I named Funaki went more than any of us - including me, he is one of the two that met someone through speed dating and got engaged (although his date with Amy was a disaster haha)", "subreddit": "ForeverAlone"}

We always watched videos together and played random games that always had me out of breath from laughing. She also had another close friend (definately closer than I could be) who she talked to often, but I didn't care because why would I? Hes just another friend of hers, and she seemed to enjoy his company as much as mine. I even talked to him and he seemed like a good person. Then, she told me she got together with a mutual friend of ours in December. No big deal, she just had an SO and I was happy for her. Then I started noticing that she would start giving excuses not to hang out more often, and our chats became less frequent and shorter. She'd always be sleeping for long periods of time at random times of the day, busy doing homework, or busy watching anime with her other best bud. The past month was an eye opener, because I noticed it felt just like how we were when we first met: Awkward, small talk about things we barely had in common. I think its because of me always having trouble dealing with social interactions, and she eventually got annoyed of our daily conversations.\n\nThen, theres my other friends I hang out with.\n\nAt the beginning of this school year (August 2018), my friend Lemon introduced me to 3 of her friends she hangs out with all the time. I wasn't the closest of friends to Suhaymah, but I wasn't opposed to becoming closer with her and her friends either. Toast, Apple, and Butter were different from the people I usually talk to on a day-to-day basis. It was like a new fresh breath of air to me, and I enjoyed it. In October, Jennifer stopped coming to talk to us because she wanted to focus on her studies. Then, on New Years Eve, Toast confessed her feelings for me and avoided all contact with me in school for a month since I rejected her. Now, neither Lemon nor Butter want to talk much since I was the source of their friend's problems. I was seen as the bad guy, but they didn't want to say it to my face. Even the usual guys that I talk to have started talking less and less to me for reasons I wish I knew.\n\nIf I'm lucky, the peak of my daily social life will be saying good morning and good night to my best friend. The most I can dream of is going back to when we would watch dramas at 2 AM and have chats that would last for hours on end.\n\n\"But why can't you say this to their faces and talk it out?\"\n\nFirst, I'm scared of confrontation. I'd rather chug a gallon of milk before doing anything close to that. Second, I'm afraid my friends won't see and talk to me the same way. I want them to feel at ease and carefree when they're talking to me, because who cares about my problems anyways?\n\nIn conclusion: I'm a bafoon that nobody wants to be with.\n\nP.S. The names I gave for my friends aren't real if you're wondering. I just put a placeholder there with foods because I'm feeling a little hungry at the moment.", "subreddit": "lonely"}

Just need to get some words out of my system. I'm a 16 year old girl in high school. \n\nI'm a good conversationalist. Most of those I'm surrounded with get along with me. But I feel cooped, up, alone, and gross nearly all of the time?\n\nI go to an all-girl's school with a great education that I am incredibly grateful for. However, the student population is very, very small. There are very, very few people I don't feel tense around. The environment is competitive, and I've definitely started hinging my self-worth on grades, and the place makes me feel unworthy and miserable. I've been trying to branch out for two years, with limited luck. Every connection I've made is half-formed at best, and even so, I'm not allowed out on weekends anymore- all I'm allowed to do is work, and I feel sick and lonely and miserable.  I need to just finish high school and get out, quickly as possible. \n\nHowever- recently met some people from a different school that I really clicked with, the first time in many years. I felt so warm, so welcomed, so wanted, that I nearly cried when I got home. I've just found out today that it isn't going to work. I won't go into it, but by pursuing this friendship/potential romance, some people could really get hurt. There's a timebomb on this thing, and I feel sick. I was so close, just for it to be pulled away, because I really don't want to be an asshole. I feel like I keep getting picked up and dropped, over and over, stomach lurching and all.

If you google the word, the first definition comes up as \"unpleasant or repulsive, especially in appearance.\" \n\n\nI'd also like to point out the **second** definition says \"involving or likely to involve violence or other unpleasantness.\" This doesn't help my point, but I would like to mention this because of all the \"SCHOOL SHOOTERS!!!one!!!@111!!!!\" comments that a ~~lot~~ shit-ton of us get on a daily basis simply for being ugly.\n\n\nCan someone be ugly on the inside? Hell yeah. People like Tom Brady, Kevin Hart, Chad Kroger -- they're all \"attractive\" to some people. Chiseled features, charismatic, built (not necessarily tall, but that's okay because Hart is loaded and probably is packing heat if yaknowwhatimsayin)... But one's a cheater, the other's a racist, and Chad's a douchebag. \n\n\n\n... Or so they say. I'd like to think Kroger's an okay guy but I never met him myself. I dunno. Unpopular opinion : *I* like Nickelback. \n\n\nI'm getting off-topic. I usually get a lot of inspiration for posts from *other* threads on here that really get me to thinking, and this one is no exception. I dunno how unpopular my conjecture here is, but I wouldn't exactly mind a shorter girl. Matter of fact, an even **less** popular opinion I have is that I'd like a girl that's less sexualized in people's eyes. What do I mean by that?\n\n\nShe doesn't *have* to have huge [boobs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5fJ4WlCVhyk). I'd prefer my ideal girl to be shorter just because I am too and for once in my life I'd like to feel like I'm not out in public with my older sister or something.\n\n\n\n\nI hate it when girls think they have to put on 50 layers of makeup, followed by fake plastic eye-lashes and even bigger fingernails. The level of insecurity that shines through literally every effort they make to conceal it all is almost palpable. This is especially prominent in your social media bullshit  \n\n\n\nAlso as a side note, I'd prefer her to be a brunette but I'm pretty sure that's more of a preference \n\n\n\n\nIt's okay, though : When girls are insecure and shy it's \"cute\" and guys are just told to \"sack the fuck up.\" Which... Technically, isn't really **bad** advice. I'm a *big* advocate of bottling up your emotions and letting them fester until:\n\n- The problem is no longer a problem \n\n- You snap and take it out on the nearest person \n\n\nPerhaps **that's** what makes someone ugly. Their interior. I'd like to think I'm a -1 in the looks department. Before I got my new hairstyle I was a solid -3, so there's progress already.\n\n\n\n\nHowever, what if I'm ugly to **people** in general? What if they can sense that I carry depressive energy with me? I can keep my head held high all day, shoulders back and spine straight with a look of confidence about me.\n\n\n\n\n... But it's all hollow if I do all this enough that people are like \"damn, now *that* guy's got his shit together\" and still know that deep down, in my heart, there's something **seriously** wrong that hasn't been dealt with yet.\n\n\n\n\n...

The thing that makes me upset is that men/ boys are expected to make the first move this is an issue because I\u2019m afraid that I\u2019m too ugly to date or be attracted to. And the only people who thrive in this system are people who are confident and secure. And here\u2019s the thing I derive my security and value from the validation and praise of others which basically means if I don\u2019t have someone that likes me ever I\u2019ll never be confident. I don\u2019t have the mental capacity to be alone I don\u2019t Value myself at all.

I can\u2019t look at Reddit too long because all the \u201cmy girlfriend made me this or drew me this\u201d posts I can\u2019t even watch tv or read books with romance as a subplot because it just makes me upset with how lonely I am. I don\u2019t want to be trapped alone with myself anymore. I don\u2019t need constant attention or affection but the concept of being loved by someone is enough to make me be a less pitiful person.

I haven\u2019t even seen a girl my age since middle school and I\u2019m going to an all Male school I have to complete. I\u2019m not sure my social skills is gonna get better in college either because I\u2019d just be in the corner sweating at a party and I\u2019d be too worried about flunking my classes to go anyhow.

When I was a freshman in high school is when things started getting bad. I got bad acne which made me develope bad social anxiety and withdrawal myself. This is when my depression and loneliness started. Throughout high school I would always avoid social situations which made me miss out on so so many amazing opportunities to meet people and develop relationships. The depression also effected my grades and I barely passed high school. Fast forward to mid senior year, I discovered the beauty of how opioids can make you feel. There was a bottle in a bathroom in my house and I was doing terrible emotionally so I said fuck it and took them. They made me feel happier than I had ever felt in my entire life. I found a dealer who I was able to get them from and was able to manage the addiction and only use twice a week. I barely graduated high school and then the few friends I had moved off the college while I had to stay at a community college. The fact that I now had zero friends paired with the fact that I was missing out on the college experience of meeting new people and living in dorms made me spiral into full blown addiction to opioids and amphetamines. I was using at least one of them every single day for months until I managed to sober up a few months ago. I heard about a community college in Santa Barbara that had dorms and I really really wanted to experience a college lifestyle so I moved into the dorms there but I was still completely alone. All the people there had already developed friend groups and I would just sit alone in my room after classes. This is when my alcoholism developed, I would steal bottle of vodka from stores and be drunk basically 24/7. Eventually, my roomates were doing cocaine and invited me to join them. We all did coke and then I was invited to a party with them. I was excited to finally have the possibility of a social life but instead they turned out to be fucking snakes. The next day my roomates reported me for excessive drinking and drug use in the dorms to try to get less people in the rooms so they could have more space. I was evicted and am now living back at home and having to commute for 3 hours a day to the school. Then, a few weeks ago I managed to reestablish contact with a friend from high school and he invited me to visit his college. I went down and was legitimately happy while sober for the first time in years. I hit it off with a bunch of people in his hall and even met a girl. We ended up making out and it was the second person I've ever kissed. I left but ended up feeling worse because I found a place that I was actually happy in but it is impossible for me to reach it. I texted with the girl and eventually told her that I liked her but she said that she wasnt interested in dating me which fucking hurt so much. I thought I found someone who actually liked me but I was wrong. My life has just been a series of terrible idiotic decisions by me, that always lead to more and more pain. I wish with all of my heart that I was at a college and had a group of people who I loved and loved me. That's all I really want, to have someone to love and who loves me. I still drink often and now I know I'm going to relapse soon. I was able to quit amphetamines without thinking about them much after but with opioids I still dream about using at least three times a week. They are the only thing in the fucking world that makes me feel happy. God I just want to fucking die. I could really use someone to talk with right now.\n\nTL,DR: I am a lonely, depressed, alcoholic, \"Ex-addict\" who is missing out on the college experience and has no social life. I'm about to relapse and could really use someone to talk with.", "subreddit": "lonely"}

We talk almost every day, and it seemed we really got along. I seriously thought I had something going with her. \n\nIn November I asked her if she'd like to meet for coffee on the weekend. She told me \"Oh I'm busy with a friend this weekend.\" I know realistically that is basically rejection, but it left me with false hope that maybe there's still a chance she'll decide she likes me.\n\nIn January, after it still seemed like things were positive with her, I finally worked up the courage to say \"I really like you.\" The response was \"I'm not looking for a relationship at this point in life.\"\n\nAside from being asexual (and I do have one friend who truly is asexual), I have a hard time believing that a 29 year old would not be interested in dating at all, but I left it at that and backed off.\n\nI've been trying to get over my feelings since, but what really stings is this morning I saw her tagged in pictures on Facebook with a guy who is clearly someone she is together with, arms around her and everything. Typical hot guy with a nice beard, slicked-back hair, etc. I don't know if I should call him \"Chad\" since I have no idea who the guy is, he could be a perfectly good guy. But it still hurts that she lied to me.\n\nI don't get it. I've gotten along with this girl so well... What does that guy have to offer that I don't, and why wasn't she honest with me?\n\nThis isn't the first time I've heard the \"I'm busy\" or \"I'm not looking for a relationship\" lines. Why girls do this all the time? Why couldn't she have just told me she doesn't like me in that way? It would have made it so much easier to get over her, and not be left with the false hope. I know that maybe they don't want to hurt guys feelings, but it's so much better in the long run to just give a proper rejection. And it hurts even more to find out from a Facebook picture that she rejected me for a hotter guy.\n\nOn a maybe positive note, though, a different girl just asked me out the other day. At least I think she did...she invited me to a party. I have a hard time believing it was romantic, though, and I'm not too sure how I feel about her. I don't know if I should go out with someone just because I'm lonely and trying to get over someone else, but maybe I should give it a try.

{"post_id": "aumscr", "created_utc": 1551110583, "title": "The influence of social media on the perception of who you are (rant)", "author": "MrNeverwinter", "self_text": "I'm sure I don't have to tell you all that social media can be a quite confronting place when you have a sub-par social existence. Many of us have shut down their Facebook account by now and/or refuse to jump on the Instagram bandwagon that has been rolling down Normie Main St.\n\nIncreasingly, however, these websites dictate our world view (or at least of those around us) and have become the 'business cards' of our everyday social life. I'm not sure what your experience is when people ask you for your Insta-ID and you have to tell them that you don't have one, but I can certainly attest to quite a few furrowed brows in the past. Having no Instagram (or equivalents) is automatically regarded as worthy of suspicion. We have come a long way from the days of anonymous bliss our ancestors used to enjoy. It was a time where you would be 'judged' (yes, a loaded word, but let's face it, that is what everyone does) on the basis of your present physical and emotional appearance and not by the amount of followers and profile picture likes you get. That's already difficult enough, methinks. Sure, many will argue, these are extremely vain and superficial measurements of a man's or woman's worth, but once again, a first impression is difficult to shake, certainly when you have a lot to compensate for.\n\nToday, I still have Facebook and LinkedIn. There are upsides, no doubt. I find LinkedIn actually has a few good features to connect with business acquintances, Facebook also has its perks, such as Messenger. But apart from that, I shy away from showing myself on there as much as I can. Much like 'real life' in a way. The thought of one of my profile pictures being pasted on everyone's feed, ready to be judged with the ever-present 'thumbs up', fills me with shame shivers along the way (even though quality posts are far and few between, in light of the amount of shit that others are willing to share with us without restraint). Safe to say, my timeline is about as empty as my testies after a night of the best sex that I've never had.\n\nUltimately, I feel like having a semblance of a shot at improving the situation wherein I have landed, entails me having social media. And not just an account, but one that is about as vain as those of my peers. It's the only way people will not immediately judge you as being unpopular and henceforth not worth hanging out with. Thus, unattractive. I realize I am enlarging the impact of social media here, and that some people honestly do not give that much of a shit whether you have a profile or not, but you would not believe the amount of (largely implicit) grief I have suffered for not living up to modern standards in that regard. It's not that I care much about what I post or do not post on there or what others do with their free time, but more the weight many of my peers seem to give it in this day and age.\n\nYou also end up in a bit of a vicious circle, seeing as it can be hard to get to know people, make meaningful connections, when they are judging you for the lack of social media presence, which then prevents you from really ever generating such a presence. Unless you create imaginary friends to like your posts (which is a thing btw; you can buy likes and friends at a discounted rate nowadays).\n\nEnd rant. Sorry for the disjointed rave. I'd like to conclude by asking you about your stance on this matter. Is it worth investing in or are you generally indifferent towards social media. Have you had any negative experiences by not having a social media account or by not appearing popular on there?", "subreddit": "ForeverAlone"}

Before you guys say im not FA, despite that one relationship I am still a Kissless, hugless, hand holdless virgin. \n\nSo its a long story but I'll try to skim it.\n\nSo in 11th grade we moved to a different state. It was my first chance to no longer be that shy weird kid everyone knew since elementary school and so I put myself out there and tried to be more open and I thought i did good. I fell for this girl the first week of school who was tasked with showing me around and I started to talk to her and flirt a lot every day all day. Everyone thought we were dating but in reality she was in a long distance relationship with someone and didnt want to date.. so after junior year i left it.\n\nFast forward we still talked a bit here and there but not much and then end of senior year she moved, she was a year below me. I graduated and we clicked back in those last few months over fb. She told me she did in fact like me and wished i didnt give up and i still liked her and we start dating but keep in mind at this point shes moved and I'm moving back to my original state for college. We date long distance doing video calls and phone calls and texting and everything all the time. I wasnt the best bf but I thought i was great at talking and joking around and being charming. \n\nAnyway after close to a year of nothing but long distance, i know i did try to meet her but we couldnt she was in high school still living with her mother and for reasons we couldn't meet. She cheats on me and some other reasons i dump her but I regret it for years to come because I thought she was the one. My one chance I had. She recently got married too. And since i dumped her and started college i've been back to my shitty loser shy weirdo life no one talks to me and all the regular jazz we all go thru but the one thing that made me happy was I at least had that relationship so I thought someone can love me right????\n\nWell due to weird situation me and that girl end up reconnecting recently and we are talking and she mentions something about being friends and I make a joke, \"so you are saying we werent friends?\" and she said \"I would say before we were more like acquaintances, It can be hard to have a conversation with you if I'm being honest. Our conversations were so dry so I was like welp whats the point and thats why we stopped talking.\"  \n\nSo it hits me.. The one real relationship I thought i had, the closest thing to one at least. Something i could be happy about even tho i'm back to living a shitty life now.. was nothing more then acquaintances...

I will never get to experience meeting her, having chemistry, going on a date, that warm feeling when you get a text message from a woman you are interested in, a night out together, sex, cuddling, waking up next to someone, going on trips together and everything else that is considered normal for most people. I know people will tell me it's never over but for me it is. \n\nI'm in a dark place tonight. I have no future. At best I will be able to endure the rest of my hopefully short existence. \n\nThis is unrelated so don't try to connect them. At work, this young woman who has a boyfriend that comes in had her boyfriend walk in to see her Once again, I get the vibe that she doesn't like me and her boyfriend saying hi to everyone except me supports my thinking that it is the case. They hugged in front of me and it wasn't the worst display of PDA I've seen. The winner of that is still the couple making out and groping on a couch facing me at a coffee shop years ago. After they walked out the barista apologized for it but I told her, it's not your fault the couple decided to do that in front of me. Back to tonight, multiple co-workers talking to her boyfriend and I just stood there made it even more obvious I don't belong in public. I tried guys. People just don't like me. They never have.\n\nUnrelated but I saw that RottenTomatoes removed that want to watch score for Captain Marvel. I'm a casual movie fan of those comic book movies so personally I didn't care. I did do some searching and found myself on another sub where they labeled the people who brought the want to watch score down so low as incel trolls. This is why incel has lost all meaning. They said incel youtubers were also behind it. Last I checked, incel was a state of being, not beliefs. Obviously I've given up trying to fight that because there is no point. Now social media thinks incels have the ability to single handily bring down the score of a movie. I didn't know incels were that powerful. Maybe they will run for office and take over the country. I just had to laugh at all of that. \n\nI tried guys. I tried my best. I tried my best for so many years. I tried for so many years but failed. Everyday I get told bad news. My sister who I don't talk to dropped her dogs off with me and drove to the airport to fly to Mexico. She is on a tropical beach and I'm stuck with her dogs. I have a love for dogs and could never do anything to her dogs like take them home. They shouldn't have to suffer because of my sister's actions. She tells me how she can't afford to buy dog food then is able to afford to take herself to Mexico. I haven't gotten to go on a vacation in 13 years but she goes away multiple times a year. I'm only mad about the dogs since she can go wherever she wants. I'm jealous I will never get to go on a vacation. \n\nI've been thinking tonight and the world is better off without me. I'm not threatening to do anything. I will wake up tomorrow and go to work tomorrow afternoon. After the events of the past few days, actually having to give up hope is more difficult than I thought because there is a difference between giving up and accepting it. \n\nI hope none of you end up like me.

I keep saying, \"I'm busy; there's no sense entering a relationship with someone that will barely get to see me,\" or \"They're clearly not interested in me anyway, so I should avoid the embarrassment.\" That kind of stuff has been plaguing me since freshman year of highschool. As far as I can tell, I've got two main problems:\n**(Don't worry, there's a TL;DR down there)**\n\nThe first is that I tend to think down on myself. Friends of mine have told others, and even told me to my face, that I'm one of the kindest people they know. I'm constantly told I'm considerate, optimistic, and a great friend. Despite these compliments though, I only seem to see my flaws. I see all the times I've let people down, all the promises I've broken, all the things I could have done and didn't, all the things I've done in secret that I shouldn't, and I wonder if I'd still be getting those compliments if they only knew me in complete privacy.\n\nThe second is that I want so badly to avoid heartbreak that I'm scared to enter any romantic relationship at all. The thought of someone breaking up with me doesn't scare me as much as the thought of having to break up with someone. On the off chance that I eventually enter a relationship with someone I don't end up liking in that way, I may never actually break it off for feat that they would be hurt. I know that the right thing to do would be to be honest with them and let them find someone who does return their feelings, but I'm honestly not sure if I could do that.\n\nTL;DR\n\nI doubt my self worth and have a constant fear of being heartbroken/breaking others' hearts and that causes me to isolate myself.\n\n\nI'm not really looking for advice, although I'll gladly accept some; I mainly just needed to vent. I didn't want to put all this on my friends and family, but I REALLY needed to get this out of my system. Like I said earlier, this has kinda been building since freshman year of high school. I've been keeping it bottled up for way too long.\n\n\nEdit: Looking back at this, some points in the post sound like bragging. That honestly wasn't the intention there. I just wanted to provide some context for why I doubt myself. My family and friends are always giving me these compliments, but I genuinely think I don't live up to them.

My story is not much different than all of yours but here goes. I always had a lot of friends growing up but never felt like i truly belonged with them. I was always the outcast and the one that would get teased because I cried. When I started only hanging out with boys(i'm a girl btw) I felt so much better, I was a tomboy myself so it made sense. Growing up we drifted apart and stopped spending any time together, now we are nothing more than strangers. I always felt best only having one best friend at a time, I never liked big crowds or hanging out with more than two or three people, as i always felt stupid and less worthy. During the years every one of my 'best' friends found some reason we should stop being friends. One was mad at me because of something stupid i said, but in reality she was jealous because i was good friends with a guy she liked. So she just stopped talking to me altogether. The second was so possessive and was insanely jealous that i spent time with my boyfriend instead of her, and the third one got mad at me for some money i borrowed from her,she said pay me back whenever you can it's fine, she knew my situation, but as time went by she grew colder, only to tell me that she doesn't care anymore about me, and it's not about the money it's my behavior. I behaved as i always did with her, she just wouldn't confess that the money was the problem. I never had any problem just cutting people of my life, because all of them turned out to be toxic and took more from me than they gave. If i had a problem it was no big deal, but their problems were the worst and if i wasn't there for them they would be mad. So i'm not sorry this happened, I just feel like i'm incompatible with people. i feel much better being on my own than having to go through all that drama again.

And i'm still living with that consequence of my foolishness.\n\nMost of the times since, i felt that maybe i have screwed up my one chance of finding my partner. Like God is telling me that \"i gave you one shot at the best and you messed up. Now there isnt anymore for you.\" That's the feeling i've gotten since then. I've tried to ask girls out but to no avail. Either them blowing me off at the last minute or just didnt show any interest. It gets tiring.\n\nRecently 3 of my best friends got attached and that just leaves me being the only one single. I'm really happy for them but personally, it sucks for me. It's like seeing everyone else finding love and yet i'm not even close to it really hurts. I dont even know if i'll ever find someone because maybe not all of us are meant for someone.

I'm sure some of you guys can relate to this, but every time I develop feelings for someone I'm too scared to confess for fear of ruining our friendship. I'm fortunate in that I have a few close friends, but it has also prevented me from ever having a romantic relationship, and it's really getting me down.\n\nI've had feelings for my friend for a while now, I'd say around 2 years (most of the time I've known her). I've never bonded with another person so quickly and on such a deep level than with her, we're so compatible it's almost crazy. She's said in the past that whenever she's had a crush on someone, she's told them upfront and if they don't feel the same way she just moves on. Which should be encouraging for me, but I'm so terrified of ruining one of the best friendships I've ever had that I'm not sure I could ever do it. To be in a romantic relationship would mean everything to me (I swear I fall for her more every time I see her) but there's no way we could go back to how we were if I told her how I feel. \n\nBut do you think I should take the plunge and ask her out? I'm simultaneously petrified of being in a relationship and yet aching for it at the same time.

The chairs are filling up, I take my seat and there\u2019s on chair remaining that\u2019s on my left side. The only girl in the class is the last to show up; she looks at the empty seat, and I swear she glanced at me, and the asked the teacher if there was anymore chairs laying around. I don\u2019t think he noticed that there was an open chair because he\u2019s like yeah there\u2019s more over there. So she goes and gets a chair. \n\nThat\u2019s not the end. We get done with out discussion and go to take our seats in the actual theater chairs to watch a movie. I\u2019m going to same row that usually sit in and I don\u2019t notice the girl about to sit in that row as well. I kinda of hesitate and think about maybe moving back a row to get a better view of the screen. So I\u2019m at the end and haven\u2019t taken a seat end. Well I shit you not, the girls looks right at me and starts to turn the other way to go to a different spot. And I do the same thing at the same time without really thinking. So what does the girl do, she sees me do this and then sits down in that row while I just continue on and take a seat two rows back. \n\nI may be overthinking this a little and the first instance she may have not wanted to sit next to the other person that was near the open seat, or she didn\u2019t see it. Maybe. But the second thing that she did, was definitely done on purpose because she\u2019s done something similar, where I sat down in the same row as her(because it was were I had sat on previous days and it was a good spot to see the screen) like 5 or 6 seats  away from her, and without looking at me she quickly lifted up her backpack and moved rows. \nLike what the hell? It seems like some girls are just so stuck up. I didn\u2019t try to hit on her and I wasn\u2019t checking her out, but her, and other girls before her, have always treated me like a creep.

All the while my peers are just watching fucking humiliating. That\u2019s never happened to me before so I had no idea what to do except just absorb it and keep playing the part. After it was over.

First, I just want to appreciate everybody who takes the time to read this, because this will be very long.\n\nI honestly don't think I'll ever get a girlfriend. Now I know you'll say it's a bit early, but I know I will not already. I just can't see myself ever getting a girlfriend. I'm not attractive, physically and mentally. I am athletic, but I have more a runner's body than muscle. I'm going to the gym to fix this, and doing ab/chest workouts at home as well, but this isn't my main problem. I'm also not good looking; I'd give msyelf a 3/10 at most. This means most girls won't even give me a chance. Now, mentally. When I was in middle school, it was a running joke that everbody would chant \"(my name here)-HOT!\" This completely decimated my self-confidence, and I can't even take compliments from a girl (like I'd ever get one), without thinking they're making fun of me. I also never talk to girls, and when I try, they leave me on \"opened,\" so to speak. \n\nAnother thing, I have never been very social. I don't really hang out with my so-called \"friends,\" or even talk to them outside of school. I'm almost always the one who initiates conversations. I'm not trying to be on the front page of r/iamverysmart, but I do very well in school, so the only time people actually initiate a conversation with me is for help on the homework or something. \n\nIn conclusion, I honesly don't see the point in trying anymore. It seems like college will be the same as high school, just with binge drinking and more stress. My \"friends\" wouldn't care if I died, any girls who even know me certainly wouldn't. The only people who would care is my family. What is the point? I just feel like another waste of space in the world.

The coaches that i'm refering to are the ones at my school. They are total assholes. I used to have a coach who was such an asshole it hurts to even remeber him.

(The kid had asked to sit out because he was having kidney problems.) I'm not overselling it , this genuinely happened. My freind's grandma eventually reported him to the school principal and he was fired. Only to be replaced by another asshole. A lesser asshole , but still an asshole. Here's a list of some of the things that I do that I think are wrong.\n\n* They Make fun of children (for various reasons)\n* They make unnessesary rules for us and refuse to stay out of our buisness.\n\nExample: In dodgeball , if we hold a ball for five seconds , we're out. (Not even how you play dodgeball)\n\nExample 2: In dodgeball (Again) if we go in the shade , we're out. (It's typically 60-100 degrees where I live during our recess period. Also note that the shade is literally inches from where we are playing dodgeball.)\n\nExample 3: If you hit the coach , even if on accident , in dodgeball , you \"sit out\" for the rest of recess.\n\n* Unnessasary name calling. (Not even to be playful , blatant bullying)\n\nThey have this rule that I can kind of understand , its that a boy or group of boys and a girl or group of girls cannot go behind the bleachers or  out of their sight because they might \"Do stuff\" which is a strecth. The worst that could happen is a fight.\n\nI'm Serious on this just need advice.", "subreddit": "ForeverAlone"}

{"post_id": "avnxop", "created_utc": 1551335988, "title": "Have you had friends? What were they like?", "author": "Fixed_Assets", "self_text": "I think a lot of the discussions around here overwhelmingly are about men trying to find a gf and get the hell out of the FA trap that is our lives.  But there is a far worse trap for those guys who have never found love, but have never even found friendship.\n\nTo tell my story - I've always had problems relating to people.  I learned why when I was in middle school/high school and was diagnosed with aspergers syndrome, which basically means I was a shy and antisocial nerd that nobody wanted to play with.  When other kids were talking about their favourite sports teams and movies, I was interested in discussing cloud formations, how many different types of sharks there are in the world, or sharing my knowledge about how many moons each planet in the solar system had.\n\nI was definitely weird.\n\nI did have the occasional friend though.  In 5th grade, I made friends with a popular kid who loved playing basketball and video games.  He found out I had a new Super Nintendo when I was 10 and we became best of friends for a while.  Ironically, he was a very attractive guy who girls were crazy about, but still was a cool dude who was nice to me, despite my nerdish upbringing.\n\nWhen I was in middle school, most of \"friends\" I made were with the school bullies.  They tried making fun of me, but instead of getting mad, I gave them props for an excellent burn one time.  They got confused and we later ended up hanging out.  I remember they tried to teach me how to be like the cool kids instead of a little weirdo, but it didn't work very well because you can't really cure aspergers that way.\n\nMy first real friend I still keep in contact with was in high school.  Another shy nerdy kid sat next to me in the back of my sophomore math class and asked me about some video game magazine I was reading. I resisted at first, but eventually we became really good friends.  I remember he would give me a ride to school every day because my parents couldn't afford a car (and they took theirs to work every day).  He's the reason by blood always boils when some scumbag bitch talks shit about how nice guys are misogynists because this guy was the quintessential nice guy.  Kind, loyal, dependable, honest, and utterly unlucky with the ladies.  His friends didn't particularly like me so I never joined their friend group.\n\nIt was at this point that I realized that I was only ever good at making friends on a one-on-one basis.  At the end of my high school year, I had only made basically 4 friends my entire life.\n\nI didn't have any friends who were girls up until that point because I was quite honestly afraid of them.  That changed when I got into college and I met this girl who was in one of the same academic clubs as I was.  She ended up being like a sister to me - she ended up ditching her best friend at the time and when I asked why she told me it was because she finally realized that this friend was a horrible person after many things she had done, but the deal-breaker was that her friend was telling people that I was the ugliest guy on campus.  A true friend indeed.\n\nI'm now 39 and currently have three friends, all of them I met through work about six years ago. I have had many acquaintances since then and people who like me, but generally speaking, very few friends.\n\nOne is a girl from Colorado who moved to the Bay Area for work.  She would definitely fall under the textbook definition of hot, but she's nearly half my age and very awkward and weird so we got along great.  I ended up setting her up with her current boyfriend.  They are talking about moving away to Texas together soon.\n\nThe other is a guy pushing 50 who is overweight and not the best looking guy, but totally killer with the ladies - mostly because he's got the silver tongue.  Also married, which is truly tragic since he has a gift.  He's also a weird guy who held all kinds of random jobs, from being in the Navy to working in a brewery and even did production work on a popular 90s TV show you've probably heard of before.  He and I still hang out, but I avoid his wife since she doesn't approve of our friendship.\n\nThe last person I am friends with is also a woman who I met at work.  She is a misfit who says all wrong things and is blunt and straight with the truth.  Her husband and I are also really good friends and is another quintessential nice guy.  They just recently had a baby so I don't hang out with them too much at all.\n\nI guess the point I am trying to get across is that I've never been good at being friends with normal people.  I never was the guy who could pull in friends by being cool or hip or popular.  Never really had a friend-group, or \"squad\" as the kids nowadays like to say.  I am terrible at social events and in the few rare instances that I had to go to a party, I would be the guy talking to the dog while everyone else got their social game on.\n\nBut I was pretty good at befriending the random misfits in my life that were just as weird and unusual as I am.  I like to think that we appreciated each other's odd qualities.  I haven't really made any friends since I met them about 5 years ago.  And I imagine that once they start moving on with their lives - I'll be alone again.  It's weird being the 40ish year old single guy when everyone else is paired off.\n\nWhat about you?

Every shitty thing that happens to me it's because of who I am. I deserve to be alone, and I cannot blame anyone for leaving me or not even approaching me. ", "subreddit": "ForeverAlone"}

I had to decline because of my current situation. Continued discussion became painful, like I was painfully trying to draw further conversation out of me to response to what he said.\n\nThis pain reminded me of the pain I felt interacting with online friends at various times in the past. It involves a painfully tense search for things to say. Such interaction still provides some relief from loneliness, and I continued it in ways which created long term friendships.\n\nThe opposite state is when I feel inspired, I have stuff to say, and sharing it is pleasant.", "subreddit": "ForeverAlone"}

My professional life is really good, but why am I doing this If I feel alone most of the time? If I have no one to truly share some things in life, it's almost like It didn't happened. \n\nSometimes I miss my ex gf. We broke up almost one year ago. I don't want her back because I can see that she is an a**hole, but the situation makes me wonder why I can't have nice things like this kind of relationship. My social life became less enjoyable as I got older, and on the other hand she is probably doing better than me with this part of her life. I can see that I have nice things going on for me, but feeling like people don't care about me just breaks me. And I start to feel bad because I \"should not be feeling bad\", and It's an endless cycle. \n\nBy the end of the day, I'm sure that I will just study, play videogames and wait for something new to happen. Some days are just better than others.", "subreddit": "lonely"}
