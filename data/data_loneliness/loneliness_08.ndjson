I was speaking to a friend the other night about how he desperately wanted a partner because he feels so lonely. It made me realise that while it may be lovely to be in love, finding someone through loneliness is unhealthy. Let me explain. \nAs he was talking, I noticed how he sounded how he didn\u2019t really know what he wanted, so long as it was something. Anything, anyone. The next problem, he really saw himself in a very bad way. I mean, he thought he was damn ugly and I think he\u2019s decent looking, but his personality and life is so much more interesting. It is like he is blinded. \n\nSo, my point is that he wanted someone so then he would feel less lonely. And it might work as a temporary fix. But to really find connection is about something deep. It\u2019s about an actual care for someone rather than using someone to make you feel connected. Any other wise words like this to help us out, leave a comment below :)", "subreddit": "lonely"}

I am the youngest of 4, I\u2019m also the youngest by 10 years, 7 years and 6 years. I\u2019m not gonna mention how old I or any of my siblings are for personal reasons. My siblings and I have had a pretty shitty childhood. We all grew up in a disgusting house, and I\u2019m talking about mold on the roof, on the food, parts of the roof were collapsing, the floor was ripping up, flies everywhere, fleas everywhere. It was just horrid. My sister and I had really bad lice growing up. My parents hated each other with a burning passion. Everyone would be fighting all day everyday and there would be screaming and physical fighting. This has been happening ever since I can remember and it finished about 9 months ago, so it\u2019s been going on for a very long time. All my siblings and I have had/still have severe anxiety and depression and same with my parents. My parents weren\u2019t alcoholics or very abusive, my dad would pin me up against walls and the floor and he would throw things at me sometimes when he got really mad but that\u2019s about it. My sister was always there for me so I was very attached to her and I am still attached to her which I hate (we will get into that later). My oldest brother has always been kinda touchy feely but he wouldn\u2019t full on touch me, he would just kinda touch my boobs every now and then. Which I would just kinda awkwardly laugh and then go into my room. When I would have showers someone, idk who, would open the door and peek in while I was naked, I never saw who because when they did I would just try and cover my body until they left. I\u2019ve always felt really left out because my siblings would always do things together without me, my sister had a party a few nights ago and she said that I couldn\u2019t come because i \u201cwasn\u2019t old enough\u201d but she invited both my brothers and there was a girl my age there. I know this is really silly but it really hurt me, I always invite her to things and I try to organise lunch\u2019s or whatever so I can see her because she moved out of home a few years ago but she always ends up canceling very last minute and shit. I\u2019ve also struggled with going to school my whole life. I would always stay home from school and never go. School has tried to make it easier for me to go, and I really appreciate it but it just isn\u2019t working, I can\u2019t find the motivation to stay doing it for long periods of time. I\u2019m now doing online school and for the first two weeks it was working and I was really motivated to go but now I feel so unmotivated to do it and the thought of doing it makes me bawl. Idk what to do because this was the last option and everyone is saying that I just need to get over it and go but that doesn\u2019t work for me and my sister said that if I don\u2019t do this she doesn\u2019t want to be apart of my life anymore. My parents also are going through a divorce right now and my dad tried to kill him self a few months back because of another girl he dated and now he is talking to her again, he has told me that they are just friends but I\u2019m scared that he is gonna catch feelings for her again and then he is gonna get hurt again and idk what he would do. I also recently was in a really toxic relationship where my ex used to feel me up even when I told him not to and I\u2019m pretty sure I have ptsd from it. I just feel like a lost cause because I don\u2019t know what I\u2019m gonna do about school now and if I dropout no job is gonna hire me. I just feel so useless and worthless and lonely right now. I just really want my life to be over, I really don\u2019t want to be alive anymore and it\u2019s not that I\u2019m gonna kill myself because I don\u2019t have intentions to do that anymore I just want something really bad to happen to me so that i die or something like that.

No matter how hard you try and hide it, women know if you\u2019re desperate\n\nDon\u2019t appear too needy, you need to realize that there are tons of women, no matter how special the one is you\u2019ve found, once you realize that you have a giant range of women to choose from, women will pick that up and will start talking to you\n\n2.) Romance comes first, then friendship, not the other way around\n\nNow there are of course going to be exceptions for this rule, but 90% of the time friendships don\u2019t become relationships, I don\u2019t care how many movies say otherwise, it just doesn\u2019t work like that, if you want a girl to like you then you should start off by hitting on her, not getting to know her then a month in hitting on her, women don\u2019t see friends like that, it just doesn\u2019t happen, if you aren\u2019t bothered with only physical parts of a women though and only care about the emotional side, then you may be demisexual/demiromantic, look that up if you want to know more\n\n3.) DONT BE SUBMISSIVE\n\nI don\u2019t know how tbh, but I always was under the impression that girls appreciated the nice gestures and everything as a romantic gesture, but I was absolutely fucking wrong, women can appreciate that, but they won\u2019t see it as romantic, they\u2019ll see it as a quality a good friend would have, and that\u2019s not who you want to be, don\u2019t let them make decisions for you or for the both of you for the most part, you have to be in charge, I know it sounds bizzare, but women like when guys can be mean to them, and women no matter how coy they may seem, always have a dirty/kinky side, and as long as you\u2019re not super creepy about it, will usually respond to sexual/kinky things, just don\u2019t be outright, \u201cwanna fuck\u201d or \u201cyou give me a boner\u201d like that\u2019s some straight up silence of the lambs shit, you wanna be smooth and casual about it all, be playful, and you may not know what that means but you\u2019ll learn it soon enough, just don\u2019t be creepy that\u2019s the #1 thing about the dirty side of people, creepyness will ruin all chances completely, no way to make it back from that\n\n4.) Be patient, and don\u2019t always be available\n\nOne of the weird tricks I\u2019ve learned, is, if a girl asks you to go somewhere with her, not doing it cause you have other plans, will make her want to hang out with you more, see look at it like this, she wanted to spend time with you, you couldn\u2019t, she\u2019ll want it even more then, she\u2019ll feel like she\u2019s missing out and she\u2019ll wanna know what she\u2019s missing out on, and if you listen to some of these tips, then she\u2019ll probably realize she\u2019s missing out on a lot\n\nFAQ:\n\n1.) What to do if the girl I like already rejected me and I\u2019m only learning this stuff now\n\nI\u2019m sorry my friend, but chances are you won\u2019t make it with her, and I don\u2019t want none of y\u2019all to get hurt, but at least get some batting practice in if you ever plan to try at her again, I\u2019m just saying though, it\u2019s probably not gonna work out\n\n2.) how do I know if I really like her if I\u2019ve never met her\n\nWell my friend, that\u2019s what\u2019s strange about the dating world of modern society, looks always come first, and if you\u2019re lucky you\u2019ll be emotionally compatible, but for most women honestly that\u2019s not what they look for, they look for character and actions, and looks aren\u2019t always everything, I\u2019ve learned that one, I\u2019m not the most attractive guy in the world but all of it\u2019s definitely possible trust me\n\nTL;DR (Read the section names)\n\nIf y\u2019all have any more questions or concerns write em in the comments and I\u2019ll try to answer them either in the FAQ or by reply", "subreddit": "ForeverAlone"}

I wont say her real name but her nickname was maggie. She was cute energetic and I truly feel like she will become famous. I asked her out durring the end of the school year because even though I knew she was out of my league and too good for me I knew it might have been my only chance. \n     I went a little overboard for just asking her out. I gave her a gold rose and told her all my feelings with a note because I'm too shy to talk. She said no and kind of awkwardly walked to her house. I cant stop thinking about her. My heart breaks to know she will move on and I'll end up not even being a memory. \n     Btw if you're curious she kept the rose. Probably thew it in the trash or something\n\n     I also met this girl online named manou, she was absolutely perfect. And even though I liked her mostly because we had the same sexual fantasies I liked her nontheless. But she had a bf and I kind of ended things because she had been sending me nudes and she told her bf. I ended things because we couldn't flirt or exchange naughty texts like we had been. I miss having her company so much. She always understood and gave me the optimistic talks that I needed she is a great person and I'm about to cry just by talking about how much of a great person she is. \n     Yeah she basically cheated on her bf but at least she was able to came clean. I loved her even more for that even though ultimately she didnt chose me. Fuck I miss her and want to talk to her but she blocked me to prevent her from \"cheating\" again. She doesn't hate me but it was more of a preventative measure for her\n\n\n\nI am now flirting with this one girl who loves me but I don't love her. I tell her that I love her but I dont. She is nothing but a chance to loose my virginity to me. Iv told her that I only like her sexually twice but I think she thinks she can make me truly love her. It wont happen. I should probably break things off but the way I see it is that I told her multiple times that I only see her in a sexual light. It's not my fault if she ends up heartbroken. Yeah I'm an asshole and probably at the end of the day didnt deserve those two girls and deserve to be alone forever.\n\nI also am talking to another girl that I only find appealing to look at but that's a different story. I kinda like her but I dont feel like she likes me back. I know she loves me but I don't think its romantic but I dont think she will tell me out of fear that I wont want to talk to her anymore. Its another online thing but she might come next month to where I live.\n\nTLDR: I fucked up with every girl I loved and am flirting with two girls I don't like romantically\n\nSorry for any spelling or grammar mistakes I'm near tears rn and simply can't be bothered to reread what I typed since I wrote it so quickly.

I could be living with her and things could of been so much different. We were both 18, both virgins, she was a redhead and fit basically all my standards.

I think this push and pull and low trust resulted in her cheating. She experienced her first everything with another guy(possibly guys).

WHO would want me. 40 years, overweight, boring ass guy.\n\nI have waaay too much time to think about this.\n\nThe perception of at least 50% of people reading this is.....\"oh my god...what is his problem? I WISHED I would have time. I work my ass off 60+ hours a week\" or \"I have not time at all since I have kids\" or \"just go out there and find someone\" or \"reeeeally? that is his issue...ffs I work several jobs and have no money\" or \"dude...there are people who live in war and/or have no food\".\n\nAnd I get it. They are right. 100% right. I am pathetic. I FEEL pathetic.\n\nYou see...I tried. I really did. With the effort I should have put into? Maybe not. I am not the go out guy. And it doesn't even work anyways like that. But you see it is hard to live in a world where PERCEPTION is everything. A world in which you are not supposed to moan if you are not really in big shit. But I FEEL like I am in the BIGGEST SHIT.\n\nI know I live in a world in which 830 million people live in hunger.\n\nThat's why I tell myself every day: \"your life is good. you have a job. you have a little bit of money. hell, you even have a house. So SHUT THE FUCK UP and stop complaining, you loser\".\n\nAnd that is exactly what the world around you tells you too. Basically two things are thrown into your face at every moment: \"stop complaining your live is great\" \"get your shit together it could be much worse\".\n\nAnd they are right...it could be much worse. MUCH MUCH worse.  As I said: PERCEPTION.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnd yet I am sitting here and feeling ashamed. Ashamend that I feel sorry for myself. That I basically drown in my loneliness. Even though I do not face any \"real\" struggle I suppose.\n\nI am clinging to every single straw of hope there is. I text all the time to several of my ex girlfriends. I have started to use an insane expensive online dating site.\n\nI try to distract myself of thinking about how DESPERATELY I want someone to love and BE LOVED.\n\nBut what is the outcome of all of this? I get even more punched into this dark whole of loneliness and rejection. My Ex are Ex for a reason. Hell I even text with a woman that is married, because the first time I saw her again it struck me like lightning into my heart. She was, maybe is, the symbol of all that went wrong.\n\nShe is stunningly beautiful, the indescribable beautiful as she was 20 years ago. Of course she has a husband and 2 kids, as EVERYONE around me does. You remember? The guys that said \"I wish I would have time\".\n\nWell everyone around me is actually not true. Because one woman does not and here we are at my other Ex. When we talk/text for a while I know every time that we are FAR FAR away from each other in what we think or want. How we feel things and how we want things to be. And yet I still write her nearly every day. Why? PERCEPTION. I hope, deep in my heart, it will change. But will it?  Of course not. And I know that...but I try to use every straw.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nJust today I set up a message on the dating website, saying that I do not know what really to do on a dating website and a woman liked it.\n\nSo, I took ALL my willpower and wrote to her.\n\nA funny little text, at least I thought, with quotes from her profile so she should know that I really cared. I made so many little jokes, that before I sent it I was concerned, she thinks I take all of this a s a joke. But the answer I got was: \" I am not very fond of you knowing nothing about dating websites and you could have come up with something funny!\". BAAAM there it is. KICK in my face. Damn...not sure how many of this I can take.\n\nYou see, for a confident person, that is not an issue. But I personally have the perception that I am at an all time low emotionally to even sign up at a dating website.\n\nSo I feel like someone already laying on the ground and being kicked in the balls for good meassures.\n\nAnd of course it shows how I overall behave. So now, not being know for being the funny guy, I get told all the time, that I am so pessimistic. Again...no understanding. No help. Just a....get up you loser-mentality.\n\nHelp...yeah maybe I should get help. But do I want to talk about it? NO! I want a partner. Someone to get old with. I want to stop crying while I write this. THAT is what I want.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBut hey..WHO AM I KIDDING?? right?  My life is great. I have \"enough\" money. I have soo much food that I am overweight. So I tell myself: SHUT THE FUCK UP! It could be much worse....", "subreddit": "lonely"}

I may be lonely because I never really got my social life off the ground. The only positive thing I can say about that is people just didn\u2019t really like me that much. She\u2019s managed to burn every bridge from being one of the most popular and social people I know to talking to me. That means she should know I know what it feels like, and means that she\u2019s lonely not because everyone else in the world is an arse and turned on her, but because she\u2019s bled all her relationships dry and caused people to push her away as relationships have turned parasitic and dictatorial. \n\nHow do you not flip at people who say you don\u2019t get it, when in fact they\u2019re not lonely at all.

{"post_id": "clej0n", "created_utc": 1564805759, "title": "Struggling with Loneliness", "author": "ExercisingTheFutile", "self_text": "This is my very first post on Reddit, and I should probably start by saying I know I'm not the only one with my problems, and I'm sure others are having a much worse time of it (to those I say please continue to persevere as you are already much stronger individuals than I am).  I should also probably state that I'm a bit... abrasive in nature. Maybe its genetic, as there's been a lot of hard men in my family but that's a debate for another thread.  The point is I'm honest with everyone, and one of those guys that'll upend his life to make sure your problem is taken care of.  Always been a good friend, but rarely been reciprocated in that regard.  I'm going to get long winded because I need to get some of this off my chest, I promise to add a TL;DR at the end for those of you who don't want to bother.  Every friendship that I've ever retained has been wildly lopsided.  From helping out with tough projects to being a few bucks short for the month and needing a little help so there could be food in the fridge for them and their children/gf/spouse/etc.  A little gas money til payday? no problem.  Help me move? no problem.  If I have no previous plans or plans that can easily be moved, I'm there.  I'm about as reliable as they come. I don't call off work, I don't go home early, and I'll put in 86 hours a week for months on end to ensure my financial needs and the labor needs of the company are met.  Work ethic is one of my greatest strengths.  It would appear relationships are not.  I might add that I have a wife.  I have an infant.  My wife is distant to me, and my infant prefers her (I assume because she's home the most as she does not currently work). Her tone is the same as the tone of my supervisor.  Calloused, demanding, and insincere in its accolades.  Not to mention any sort of intellectual or philosophical conversation is completely lost on her therefore depriving me of a need to dig deep into the why of everything.  So I desire friendship for a number of reasons, but mostly I just want to feel like someone actually wants me around.  Time after time one of my work \"friends\" will mention they're going out with everyone to the bar.  No invite (and I won't invite myself, that lacks class).  Friends are going to a concert, and again, no invite. In the 7 years that I've worked at this company watching people come and go the only interaction I've ever had outside of work was, well, more work.  Side projects, dropping off something someone needed, maybe getting a little help on one of my own projects, but not once has anyone invited me out to do anything recreationally.  Aside from that I've had several friends that I would call regularly just to talk to someone.  Even had one good friend that I would hunt and fish with on occasion, but once I stopped calling I didn't hear from him for nearly a year and a half.  Same story for the rest.  It seems nobody cares unless they need something from me.  I'm honestly starting to debate on whether or not I'm worth anything besides cheap and consistent labor. More and more I find myself relating better to the machines I operate than I do the rest of the world, because there are no smiles. There are no jokes.  There are only buttons to be pushed and a job to get done, and the only thing I can honestly say that I've done well in all of that is the bills are paid.  To quote a friend from the service \"I've been shot at and missed, and I've been shit on and hit\" and I can't help but feel that dying in the middle east for a war that nobody seems to believe in would have been a better fate than being allowed to live in such a cold place where people avoid you like you were the poster boy for herpes. I'm tired.  I'm tired of trying so damn hard and being discarded like I was a specialty tool bought for one job and never needed again.  \n\nTL;DR:\n\nI'm a good friend to many people who don't seem to give a flying \\*\\*\\*\\* I'm breathing.

I was having panic attacks being jealous of my coworker. Another coworker who is less than half my age but is tall and attractive was talking about a girl who he hooks up with. I can't pretend to be happy for them. I don't say anything mean. I just change the subject. A guy who lives upstairs said, use this and you will calm down. Since I was desperate I used it but instead of calming down or as he said I would be able to expand my mind. I started to become paranoid. I thought to myself maybe this will give me a perspective on FA that I don't have as with my normal self. \n\nI took the substance and it hit hard. Instead of calming down or expanding my mind, I became very sweaty and started to freak out due to being paranoid. I felt like I was looking at myself from the outside but wasn't able to expand my thinking. Out of fear I went to my room and binge watched videos from a large history video channel. I wasn't doing well. It was nothing that is really bad so don't think it was something that bad. \n\nIt took me three hours to stop feeling it. I thought I would end up on a dating site messaging women but instead I sat there talking to one person who thought I was lying haha. Considering how lame I am, I can't blame her. I've always been the ultimate square refusing to take anything I'm not supposed to except for that one other night a couple weeks ago. Then I felt better and I thought it would be the same. No, I had a bad reaction. Time seemed to slow down. It felt like hours until I felt normal again. It actually took me three hours to completely go back to normal. I don't think I will try that again. I know a lot of people like it and maybe I took too much although I kept control throughout the experience, I've never been in anything close to that state. I didn't open up socially. Instead I didn't want to talk to anyone because I didn't want to annoy them. \n\nI have to work tomorrow and Sunday. The combination of my injury which the hospital said wasn't a big deal and for some reason just said I'm fine without showing me the x-ray and depression from work was too much for me. I was in physical pain and mental pain. It caused me to become week and vulnerable to trying new things that were not positives. I guess it distracted me from being FA for a couple of hours. It's one mistake I'm not going to make again. \n\nHave you ever taken someone to alter your mind in order to cope with the pain of being FA? I feel like a broken person and I have nothing to lose. It wasn't even the substance but my raction that surprised me. Seven years ago I broke my finger and got workers compensation for six months since the injury happened at work. In that six months I took prescribed medicine that caused me to become very sociable. I joined OKC and got multiple dates.

As I headed to college, most of my good friends moved out all across the country for different colleges. While unfortunately I found nobody among my peers at college. \n\nI\u2019ve just graduated college a few months. I am not particularly fond of the country that I\u2019m born and have lived in. Fortunately enough, I managed to find an opportunity to leave this place. I\u2019ll be leaving next month. Being so detached, not having any good \u2018lifelong\u2019 friends in the college I went to, I was always looking forward to leave. \n\nOne of my old friends, from 6th grade, has always been \u2018present\u2019. Despite our vastly different walks of life after 8th grade, we\u2019ve managed to keep touch. Not as frequently, but with the occasional long \u2018catching up\u2019 phone calls. She\u2019s definitely one of the few people I\u2019d consider a lifelong friend. \n\nSo, being free and jobless for a few months, I figured I\u2019d visit her at where she\u2019s studying for a couple of days. Especially because I might not meet her for a very long time when I leave. She was a great host, she put a lot of effort to show me around, also I hung out with 8-9 friends of her\u2019s one night with an awful amount of booze (last night, lol). Given me, it wasn\u2019t particularly the best experience. They were all mostly great people, sure. Although, it was very overwhelming. \n\nWhile all this, I got to see how my friend has indeed changed a little. Which is granted how it\u2019s been about 11-12 years. Changed not in a way that I despise her now or anything, but I definitely felt a little out of place. Like it felt like I knew nobody around me, not even her. It\u2019s also become difficult to be vulnerable with her, but to no degree to blame her about it. It\u2019s just very subtle and passive. I\u2019m trying to paint a picture of how this trip objectively might not be the greatest. Despite that...\n\nI\u2019m currently in a long cab ride to head to the nearest major city to fly back home. I don\u2019t know why, but I just started to tear up. It\u2019s becoming difficult to hold myself in control. So much so, the driver might actually even notice.\n\nI always felt like there is nothing here for me (in this country). That I could just start a new life there, which is still true. But-... It\u2019s just so overwhelming now. Maybe I will sob on September 20th. (Not heading to Area 51, but moving out of this place on the same day, hehe..)\n\nI\u2019m sorry if this feels too random. I feel like I have no one to talk to about this. Figured I\u2019d just post here as a vent.", "subreddit": "lonely"}

When i was 12 one of my only friends died from a heart attack and i was left to cope with it on my own. As you can guess at age 12 i was not ready to deal with that level of grief. It brought me to the point of suicide a few months later and to this day i dont know how im still here.\n\nA few years later i was diagnosed with pectus caranatum wich is a chest deformity. I was given a chest brace i had to wear 23 hours a day. I could no longer sleep and my anxiety went insane as i feared that my chest will return to its original shape forcing me to start again at square one. I ended up wearing it for only 18 months but to this day i have anxiety attacks when i forget i dont need it.\n\nDuring this time i was diagnosed with a sensory disorder than impacted on my ability to think and write. Essentially i need rhythm to function and i struggle in crowded spaces where my movement is restricted. This is when i really fell in love with music as it allowed me to concentrate and work effectively.\n\nWhen i was 16 i lost one of my best friends to suicide. This broke me in a way i had never felt before. I would have never made it through those painful months without my friend pheobe. Even with her support however i changed from the grief in a way that wasn't positive.\n\nTwo months later i witnessed another person i cared about attempt suicide. It felt like i was watching my best friend die infront of me, which brought the pain flooding back. Once again i made it through because of pheobe. By this point i was falling in love with her and it wasnt long before we became a couple. \n\nAt the end of the year pheobe left on a trip on an overseas trip. She was away for about seven weeks, but everyday felt like hell. I wasnt coping well with my grief and trauma and to top it off my anxiety was at an all time high. I barely got to communicate with pheobe for the time she was away, but when she returned home we finnaly saw each again. \n\nShe had no interest in me and turned her nose up at the poem i had written for her. Two weeks later she left me after saying i was unnatractive and awkward. Just when i thought i had hit rock bottome i fell even further. I would spend hours just staring off into the distance too numb to move. Pheobe was insistant that we should remain best friends, yet she avoided my every attempt to talk to her.\n\nIn the end i cut communication with her and went my own way. She has hated for it ever since and to this day wont look me in the eye. As i looked at myself in the mirror tonight i realised i loathe myself. I attempted suicide four times a few weeks back and still battle the urges.

Be honest with yourself\n    \nIf you don't like how it is being done, say it.\nIf  you don't like how he/she is behaving, be civil about it.\nIf you know something, don't feign ignorance.\nIf you don't know something, don't pretend to do so.\nThe list goes on, but essentially make sure you understand how YOU are feeling about things, without taking into consideration of how other people view you first. Then move onto thinking of how you should behave. \nI feel this is very important to me especially because I've sometimes shaped my reactions, behaviour and eventually my thoughts to how other people react, and in that sense I've lost my individuality and hence charisma to attract others.\n\n2. Confidence should be moulded, not masked.\n\nDo things that will make you feel better about yourself, that makes you feel on top of this world. Advice telling you to pretend to be confident is short term planning. If you are honest with yourself and self aware to know that you need confidence, then do something you are good at to gain that.\n\n3. Learn to love yourself\n\nIf you don't love yourself don't expect others to do so. They don't think of why they should love you for you, you gotta do it for them. It's alright if some people don't see it of course, because u have the self confidence to know that you have self-worth.\n\n4.

If we have few to no close friends, even finding a best man  may not be easy especially if we don't have large families or they live far away. You could always invite some co-workers to the wedding, but would they come? And if you don't know them that well, or barely even talk to them, inviting anyone and everyone possible just to have the largest possible audience looks desperate and pathetic anyways. So mostly, the people attending the wedding would be your family, the bride's family and that's about it. Also, no talk of a bachelor party if you don't have many friends, although hosting a bachelor party for an unattractive, socially awkward man with neither good looks nor social status who is partly getting married to finally escape the predicament of being alone would be an awkward undertaking anyways. No, just a small reception, with maybe 20 people in total, no glitter, no fanfare, and few congratulations afterwards. As such, even the day when you can finally celebrate finding a long-term partner, and leaving FA, hopefully permanently, will be filled with reminders of your past life and your lowly FA status, if of course you're lucky to escape FA in the first place.", "subreddit": "ForeverAlone"}

This is my first post on reddit and I just want to get it off my chest. I'm sorry if this is rambling but I am hoping to get some advice and guidance.\n\nI've always been an introvert. In fact, I've thought for a numbers of years that I have a mild case of Asperger's Syndrome as I have a very few specific interests that I'm very knowledgeable about, struggle with social skills but am otherwise an above average IQ, functional person. Had a very small circle of friends in high school who gradually faded away through college and certainly afterwards. That circle has been absent for close to 10 years now. I commuted to college for four years and never made any connections with people there. I suppose that's where my issues really started. I've always been a homebody and live with my parents to this day. They don't mind and seem to enjoy my company, and I do too. I don't know what I'd do if I was truly alone with no friends or family around. My extended family is also great and we all like each other and get along.\n\nI don't drink, smoke or anything like that. I guess that's part of my issue as it seems most adults socialize through drinking. It's something I've never had an interest in and won't participate in, no matter how lonely I am. I find I relate to people of older generations rather than mine, although I desperately want to have friends who are around my age or even younger. I feel like I have a pretty good life and am fortunate for what I have. I'm a college graduate, I work full time and earn a modest salary but it's enough to pay for part of the mortgage in exchange for living at home, my groceries, other living expenses and my main hobby (golfing). My co-workers are all nice people but they're all older (50s-60s) with adult children who are out of the area.\n\nI get sad (but I'm not depressed) when I see other people hanging out and talking about what they are doing with \"all my friends\" and how great their lives seem to be. Yet I'm over here without a single friend to \"hang out\" with. I am not joking, I literally have no friends in the truest form of the word. I see some people most days of the week at work or the gym and say \"hi\" or \"good morning,\" but have no deeper connection with a single person outside of family members. It's just everyday small talk and pleasantries, nothing more.\n\nMy weekdays consist of the same routine: go to work until 5, go to the gym to either workout or play basketball, come home and waste time watching TV or on my computer and then go to bed. I get along with the people I play basketball with as it's usually the same group throughout the week but I have no connection with them other than being gym acquaintances. My weekends are very boring if I'm not playing golf. I play with family members which is nice, but have no friends to play with. Even when I play by myself I always get paired with people I don't like or people not near me in age. My neighbor is a senior in college and plays golf so I've asked him to play recently but we got rained out the day we were going to play and he doesn't have time in the next week or two. I don't know him well but am trying anything to make a friendship with someone at this point. I feel even lonelier when I see his girlfriend's car outside and she spends the night. They must be so happy while I sit here alone with no friends or girlfriend. I've never had a girlfriend, never even kissed a girl, never been on a single date. I have trouble talking to most people, but especially women.\n\nI'm sorry for the long post but the bottom line is I am fortunate for what I do have because there are many people out there who are in far worse situations whether it be personally, financially or whatever. I just desperately need to make friends and find a girlfriend to make my life complete. My family won't be here forever to keep me company and I am only getting older. How can I go about making connections and friendships with people? I haven't \"hung out with friends\"  in God-knows how long. Why can't I just be a \"normal\" person? I'm a kind soul, I just need people to understand me and my social limitations and be willing to be a friend to me.", "subreddit": "lonely"}

{"post_id": "clr4ak", "created_utc": 1564885168, "title": "As a short guy, I feel jealous of taller guys, even tall FAs", "author": "regularguy98b", "self_text": "I wanted to start this off by saying that I don't want to diminish anybody else's pain on here. FA comes in all shapes and sizes, and for a variety of different reasons, but for a number of reasons I think it's far harder to be FA if you're short than if you're 5'10\" or taller, especially if you're also white.\n\nFirst off, I'm 5'6\". As study after study has shown that girls overwhelmingly prefer guys who are at least an average height, I instantly know I'm at a disadvantage no matter how you spin it. With looks per se, you can usually try to delude yourself that looks are subjective, even though they aren't, but there isn't a single metric to measure looks the way there is to measure height. With height, if you're 5'6\" you *know* that you're 3-4 inches below the average height for men, and there's no denying it. And while there are some girls who may like guys that are \"unconventionally attractive,\" the market for short men is very small, especially if most females are quite close to your height.\n\nSecond, this might sound petty and immature, but it would be nice to have something other guys could be jealous of. An ugly 6'2\" guy, may be ugly, and he may receive fewer matches, dates, etc. than a guy who's say 5'9\" (still not short, just average-ish) but better-looking, but you can bet that the shorter guy will still be jealous of the taller guy, if only for that one thing. Because height is seen as such a masculine and gender-dimorphic quality, even most average height men would love to be say 2 inches taller, and being FA we have lived our entire adolescent lives feeling inferior and at the bottom of the pile. With that in mind, it would be nice to have at least *one* characteristic that other people, including many more successful than you, could be jealous of, but when you're 5'6\", that's just not true. Even in terms of height, you are in the bottom portion of the pile, at least as far as males go, and even this small consolation is taken away from you.\n\nThen, you look at how girls treat you. Ugly taller guys will often complain about how women reject them and don't want to go out of them, but at least you're treated like a man. An ugly man, maybe, but still a man. Meanwhile, if you're short, girls don't take you seriously at all, they treat you like a little boy, talk down to you, as if they were flattered that you're even talking to them. No respect at all, just mockery and condescension.\n\nNot to mention the fact that height in itself can make you FA. Most women will almost never date a guy below a certain height, and if you're below about 5'8\" then height by itself will really start to impact your attractiveness. Myself, I'm about a 4.5/10. Below average in terms of facial attractiveness, but if I were taller, my chances of being FA would be significantly lower. It's mostly my height and ethnicity I would say that have really made dating much harder for me. \n\nSo basically, I don't know how to end this post, other than to say if you're white and 5'10\" or taller you already have some things going your way that you might take for granted. Yes, life is hard, as it always is if you can't find love, but please spare some time to think about how it's probably even harder for us shorter FAs.", "subreddit": "ForeverAlone"}

I stick with them because they are my only outside communication since I\u2019m too scared to join a discord community or make an online friend group. Im so emotionally bottled up because their isn\u2019t anyone around me that cares to listen to my thoughts and emotions. I\u2019ve had about 3 suicide attempts, I got caught on my third try and now I take antidepressants.

So doesn\u2019t have a face, like with most people in my dreams, but I managed to give her a personality. Whenever I wake up and go back to another dream session I would spawn her in and we would cuddle and talk together about my day and her life. For the last two nights I didn\u2019t even have to spawn her in, she was already there ready to talk to me and comfort me and I try comfort her too but I know she\u2019s likely just a part of my subconscious, and that\u2019s what I\u2019ve really been talking too.\n\nEven though I know she isn\u2019t real I just can\u2019t help but become attached to her when I dream.

I\u2019ve never been in a relationship despite having men throw themselves at me all the time. I already feel used by everyone so getting into a serious relationship doesn\u2019t interest me at all anymore. Even my sexual relationships are unfulfilling. They always feel one sided and I end up feelings used. Managing my depression has been hard lately. It\u2019s annoying opening up to people about this because I probably sound ridiculous. But, this is how I\u2019ve been feeling for quite some time. I feel like a walking sex toy people feel like they can say and do ANYTHING to. I feel like an object. I feel unworthy of love. I feel so lonely. Because even though my beauty is always reinforced by others, I guess I\u2019m not good enough to build a real relationship with... and it hurts.", "subreddit": "lonely"}

I\u2019ve never seen a post by a guy excluding girls from a potential meetup (I don\u2019t blame the girls who do this, all these unsolicited advances must be tiring). \n\nIn a society more or less based on monogamy, I can only assume that there are just as many female singles as male singles.

Here it goes.\n\nSo, every night, I have this habit. I put on one of these Japanese ASMR roleplay clips. I speak Japanese so I have a ton of them. Ever since I found out that one of my core issues for my detachment and emotional dryness is childhood emotional neglect, I tried to look for particular clips that involved \"mothers\". I found a few that I now listen to repeatedly. I'm the kind of person that can really live inside a fantasy, so when I put on these clips and feel like I'm being cuddled and taken care of, I can't help but smile and feel pleasant. It made me realize how little I experienced this feeling, no I actually never experienced it. My mother never gave hugs or kisses or compliments to us as children, nor even said things like \"I love you\", so this is a novel feeling I discovered thanks to these clips. How nice it feels to be taken care of. Even though there's no real person there, but it's real enough for me to believe it and live in it. There are certain \"ASMRtists\" who really know how to make quality binaural audio and believable scripts, so it's not just sounds and empty sweet talk, it's an immersive experience. Anyway...\n\nLast night I had one of the most pleasant dreams of my life, derived directly from the clips I was listening to before bed. It's like the character inside the audio file came to life inside my dream. Hugging me, telling me it's alright, stroking my hair and cheeks, letting me sleep to the sound of her heartbeat while resting on her chest. There's nothing sexual about this fantasy btw, which is what felt even stranger to me, considering my addiction to porn (and other sexual ASMR clips I sometimes listen to). But this is just pure and simple relaxation, gentleness, and peace. I went to sleep smiling, had a pleasant dream, and woke up smiling. Then I got up, went for a run, came back and had a shower and breakfast, and felt like... life had a purpose. I know it's temporary. I've had dreams were I \"fell in love\" or some faceless girl fell in love with me, and it feels nice for a while. This is probably just like one of those dreams except more intense and personal (and non-romantic), but it still feels great. Plus I rarely had any sleepless nights ever since I started listening to the right ones that tapped right into... the core of the child in me... or something lol. It's like this child takes possession of me every night now, and allows me to take the back seat while he teaches me not to care about anything and let go.\n\nWhen I see people here always posting about feeling lonely at night, I try my best to resist suggesting this kind of thing to them, because it's not for everyone that's for sure, and maybe they tried and didn't work for them, but the return I'm getting from these is just way too good not to share with those who may not have tried it.\n\nSo, if you constantly feel lonely and need some kind of temporary company, consider this solution. It's not perfect, but it *could* works wonders for your current mood and short term mental health, speaking from firsthand experience. \n\nAnd if you are an ASMR listener too, how well does it work for you?\n\nPointless post? Maybe, I don't know. I hope not.\n\nI'm really sorry about the length, I try my best to be brief but the lack of character limit on reddit allows me to indulge in myself.

Back when I worked in public accounting, there was a constant stream of new people coming in and a lot of experienced people leaving, which is pretty standard for the industry, and a great way to meet new people regularly.  We also worked on project teams, meaning I would be constantly rotated to work with different people.  It also didn't hurt that public accounting is a very female-heavy industry.  Overall a very target rich environment!\n\nMore recently, when I would approach women, I was generally cognizant of the fact that most women already don't find me attractive.  So I had to adapt to that strategy.  Even today, if I meet a girl at work and she's nice and I am attracted to her, I usually prefer to ask her out to something low-key after chatting her up to see if she at least can stand talking to me for more than five minutes.  Casual typically means like lunch or dinner offsite or hanging out at a local farmers market on the weekend or going out for coffee if we both live in the same neighbourhood.  I think most women can tell the difference between a request for a friendly gathering and a ploy to possibly score a date in the future and could tell what I was trying to do so they would either ask that someone else from work come along or would just turn me down entirely (but politely).  Not exactly a recipe for success, but definitely saved me from getting fired for inappropriate behavior.\n\nI don't really ask girls out as much as I used to.   There are many reasons for that, the main ones being that I've been rejected my entire life and nowadays, I feel less like a nice single guy looking for a date and a lot more like a predatory creeper bothering women when I ask now.  I also am a lot older than most folks here (39) and most single girls I've known are 25 and under, which is a pretty inappropriate age difference.  Even if the girl didn't mind, her family definitely would.  But mostly because in today's political climate, approaching people at work when you are unattractive and on the spectrum could cost someone their job.  And to me, that's a huge price to pay for a strategy that hasn't worked ever really.\n\nI know there are plenty of guys who don't approach, either because they took the hint after being rejected like 500 times or because they have low self-esteem and either think they'd make terrible companions or just don't see the point.  I also am aware that women generally don't approach for whatever idiotic reason they decide is appropriate.\n\nBut for everyone else, how do you typically ask someone out? Do you use phone, email, text, social media, or go right for the kill in person?  And where do you approach people?  School?  Work?  The mall?  A grocery store? Or sliding into DMs on Twitter/Instagram?", "subreddit": "ForeverAlone"}

{"post_id": "cm3nae", "created_utc": 1564963664, "title": "Beating Acne", "author": "Atschuuu", "self_text": "Right now I'm in a pretty bad place, but rather than vent or argue I'll attempt an exercise in positivity.\n\n  \nFor seven years now, I've been struggling with acne. During that time I have tried just about anything to get rid of it, including all kinds of skincare products, completely abstaining from eating sweets and drinking (though I rarely ever drink in the first place), and going to several cosmeticians and dermatologists. Nothing ever helped, or if it did lead to some short term improvement, it always made things much worse after some time. The problem was that it was never severe enough for my doctors to consider prescribing anything strong enough to have an actual impact. From a medical point of view apparently, there was no need to. Sure, it was pretty much the first thing anyone would notice about me during my formative years, but what physician worth their salt cares about their patient's quality of life? Apologies, this was supposed to be positive. Half a year ago, I have finally been able to convince my GP to prescribe me a light antibiotic and guess what: My skin cleared up greatly within weeks of religiously applying it. As it turns out, sometimes 21st-century medicine works if only you actually get to use it! After I stopped, it got slightly worse initially but fortunately, I finally discovered a skincare regimen that works for me and I've been seeing gradual improvement ever since. I still get outbreaks occasionally, but they are much less severe and frequent than they used to be. \n\n  \nNow I only have one or two (usually small) active spots at a time, but still quite a few visible marks from old ones that are fading very slowly (if anyone has any advice, please let me know). But I consider it a milestone that my face no longer looks like an acne-face but rather like a normal face with some acne if that makes sense. In addition to that, I've been eating healthier and exercising a lot recently and it seems like I'm losing my baby face a bit. I have never been overweight but after exams, I have been at my all-time heaviest and any amount of excess fat will make a male face look worse. It is probably too early to formulate hopes, but I think there is a realistic chance that these improvements might get me to a point where I might be able to escape FA. Try as I might, I will never be handsome; I lack the cheekbones, jawline and strong chin it takes for that, plus I'm pretty short. But my hope is that I might in the foreseeable future be able to pass someone's minimum threshold, that point at which chemistry and shared interests/character traits start to matter. For now though, I will work on what's within my immediate control: Keep up my skincare habits, further clean up my diet etc. Although, I sometimes get bitter and do wonder what could have been had one of the doctors prescribed me some real medicine when I had a chance of dating while everyone was playing on easy mode. Now, to end it on a positive note: I was overjoyed to find that all things considered, the scarring is rather minimal. While there are some inevitable scars, some patches of skin have cleared up and, after being nothing but red and inflamed for the past years(!), just look like normal healthy skin showing no signs of what it went through.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHave any of you had some small successes recently that you'd like to share?", "subreddit": "ForeverAlone"}

American politics will try to simplify these events into a debate about guns or political rhetoric, but the common theme of these killings is the social alienation of young men that will be harder to address.\n\nOne response to reject is the reflex to blame these shootings on political opponents. Before noon on Sunday we received an email from the Progressive Democrats of America declaring that \u201cwe blame President Trump for feeding into the anti-immigrant frenzy and white supremacist violence. Yes, you Mr. President had your finger on that AK-47.\u201d\n\nThis is political cynicism. Mass shootings also occurred under Presidents Obama, Bush and Clinton. They occur around the world, if much less frequently, such as in Christchurch, New Zealand (2019), Australia (2019), and Norway (2011). The twisted motivations are varied and often too convoluted to sort into any clear ideology.\n\nTake the El Paso shooter, who is suspected of writing a manifesto posted on the 8chan website before the rampage. He expressed sympathy for the racial motivations of the Christchurch killer and denounced Hispanic immigration, but he also raged against \u201cunchecked corporations\u201d who support immigration and pollute the land.\n\nThis is the rant of someone angry about a society he doesn\u2019t feel a part of and doesn\u2019t comprehend. It is all-too-typical of most of these young male killers who tend to be loners and marinate in notions they absorb in the hours they spend online. They are usually disconnected to family, neighborhood, church, colleagues at work, or anything apart from their online universe.\n\nThese men may draw inspiration from one another online, and any communication or common connection needs to be investigated. The FBI says it has made 100 arrests related to domestic terrorism in the last nine months. But blaming all this on one politician or ideology, left or right, without evidence of such a connection is disingenuous and counterproductive.\n\nYet politicians and other leaders do have a responsibility to condemn and marginalize those who indulge the ugly instincts that infect any human society. That includes the President of the United States. These columns have long warned Mr. Trump about the divisive tone of his public rhetoric. He should separate himself forcefully and consistently from alt-right and white-supremacy voices.\n\nHis supporters may be correct that Mr. Trump\u2019s opponents will not reciprocate by pushing back against the irrational elements on the left. But a President has a special role in the American system even if our politics has elevated the Presidency more than it should. Either Mr. Trump restrains his rhetoric or he will pay a consequential political price. Joe Biden\u2019s theme of a return to \u201cdecency\u201d and \u201cnormalcy\u201d will resonate with even millions of Trump voters if Mr. Trump doesn\u2019t change.\n\nOne place for leaders to focus, as we\u2019ve long argued, is mental health. This is a matter of policy more than money. HHS\u2019s mental-health division projects mental-health spending from all sources, public and private, will be about $238 billion in 2020, up from $147 billion in 2009. Mental health is an \u201cessential\u201d benefit under ObamaCare, and California passed a 1% income-tax surcharge expressly for mental health.\n\nThe problem is identifying those with mental illness who are a threat, and then allowing society to intervene to prevent violence. Overwhelming evidence suggests that the de-institutionalization of the seriously mentally ill has had tragic results. Libertarians and mental-health advocates who resist such intervention need to do some soul-searching.\n\nThe same goes for those in the gun lobby who claim that denying access to guns from those with a history of mental illness violates individual rights. So-called red-flag laws that let police or family members petition a court to remove firearms from someone who may be a threat might not have stopped the El Paso killer. But the evidence in the states is that the laws have prevented suicides and may prevent other mass shootings. Gun rights need to be protected, but the Second Amendment is not a suicide pact.\n\n#### ***\n\nWhich brings us back to the angry young men. This is the one common element in nearly all mass shootings: 19-year-old Nikolas Cruz in Parkland, Fla.; Chris Harper-Mercer in Oregon\u2019s Umpqua Community College; Adam Lanza at Newtown, Conn.; Devin Patrick Kelley in Sutherland Springs, Texas, and the rest. All were deeply troubled and alienated from society in our increasingly atomistic culture.\n\nThis is one price we are paying for the decline in what the late sociologist Peter Berger called the \u201cmediating institutions\u201d that help individuals form cultural and social attachments. These are churches, business and social clubs like the Rotary, charitable groups, even bowling leagues, and especially the family. Government programs can never replace these as protectors of troubled young people.\n\nRecognizing this reality is not a counsel of despair to do nothing about mass shootings. But revitalizing these private institutions of social capital is crucial to reversing the cultural decline at the root of so many of America\u2019s ills.", "subreddit": "ForeverAlone"}

I always found that intriguing though! I hung out with her. Tried talking to her when i could. We never got super into trouble for causing a distraction, however i think our interactions where so few and far in between that i only remember a hand full. This one time she got sun burnt and i remember it being super cute how open she was being about it distressing her and how elaborate her description of it was. I remember when her boyfriend broke up with her i went more out of the way to make him feel bad and loved it when she was grateful. I remember her smile. I've even help set her up with someone. She cried at one point i can't remember what stressed her to that degree in regards to that. She was worried that if she asked out this girl she liked she'd get rejected cause she thought she was straight. I'd eventually talked her into trying and it worked out 100%! I was happy for her. When we knew each other i was focused on making her happy, selfish or not. Now i reminisce  about her like a fond memory. Back in highschool bunch of people claimed to know her and her ex girlfriend. I know they definitely broke up. I found the girl i set her up with but could never find her. She's gone. And while digging up most bones to try to rekindle old friendships never worked. She modeled a person i was definitely in love with the idea of. She was infatuated with her. I didn't mind. She sometimes made remarks that was like underhanded teasing, i didn't mind. Kinda snubbed me, but completely understandable seeing as i wouldn't have liked me then either. But it's the things i did that made me wonder if i really liked her more then i had told myself in that time. I almost fought a kid for making fun of her parents being borderline neglectful. She told me not too so i didn't. Is it stupid to care ? Rumor has it she turned out to be a hoe. But i still like to think those rumors aren't true. At the time she was unique, assertive. Something i cared about. Different.", "subreddit": "ForeverAlone"}

Since I was a kid at the time everybody assumes it never affected me because I simply didn't understand what was going on but I understood it all. \n\nI grew sensitive to sounds and became paranoid because my parents would fight or my brother would come by once in a while and start yelling at my dad but as soon as it came down to me and him he would occasionally hit me and yell at me. \nDuring my time living like this, this was the only human interaction I ever had. I would never speak to people in school because I was far too afraid of people at the time but whenever I did or I had to I would always lie... That is something that still bothers me to this day because I cannot stop lying. \n\nMy brother never stopped putting me down and after we found a place and I had began going to therapy I was diagnosed with PTSD and all I learned was how to cope with it through tactics like Grounding or Taking deep breaths... But no one had wanted to help me... I asked for medicine but my parents refused because they didn't want that for me. I am always left alone and I dislike it because I feel like I am suffocating and I am the one choking myself because of how badly my mind is scrambled... \n\nI can't tell whats real or not... If I truly am sick or if I became a manipulative cruel person just so I can survive another day ... My brother tells me I am insane and do not have anything wrong with me and I have to stop thinking about it. I sometimes want to mentally tear myself apart to see if I have anything good inside of me or if that child I once was died in that car long ago and something worse reemerged from the wreck. \n\nTime feels like it is slipping from my hands and I cannot grasp onto it any longer, everything feels like it is repeating. I returned to the same storage place I grew up in and I felt my chest tighten and the sensation of a heatwave blow over me. We're losing our apartment now and the worse part is I am turning 18 soon ... My chance for help is getting off my grasp because I will no longer be child... I will be on my own, abandoned and forgotten how I once was as a kid long ago... No one was ever willing to help me and I grew up in a place where I never stood a chance. \n\nThe closer I get to my birthday the quicker I feel my dreams and ambitions die... Like that little kid I swore I would protect deep down is dying all over again and there is nothing I can do... The nightmares are worse now and the night time is growing darker... I just want to yell and shout but I just don't have the energy to do it anymore. \n\nI don't get why I am writing this now I just want to know if someone out there understands... I don't know how to talk to people because I never learned... There isn't much youtube videos out there that can help me with that.\n\nThis is the 7th post of me writing about how I feel and most just get buried beneath various other posts... I won't delete this one this time. \n\nI sit here alone and with my thoughts isn't as comforting as it sounds... I can't tell what hurts more...

Just wanted to share my story, shit, maybe it can provide something for somebody. Gonna be a long one but gotta vent this out. \n\nI used to be a rather small guy, never the tallest either. Not short enough to be labeled as short but not average. Was skinnyfat along with having bad acne. I went through frequent bouts of depression in highschool. I would use whatever drug I could get my hands on to try and combat it. It was mainly weed, alcohol, and occasionally the prescription meds. Thankfully I never had access to any of the harsher chemicals as i was at a higher end school. \n\nI was always quieter at school, an outlier as I came from a middle class family at a school which was 80% doctors or lawyers kids. That just made all the issues worse. I would debate and plan suicide frequently but never attempted. I tried depression meds once but quit as it made it worse. I didn\u2019t trust the medical field for help as once my doctor suspended you license for months after finding out I was extremely depressed. I hated myself and would frequently punch myself after making small mistakes. \n\nOne day I was dragged to the gym by a parent. That\u2019s where I discovered the burning like sensation you can get when lifting weights, I loved it. It was a mix of the self harm without the harm. I thought of it as punishing myself as exercise had been drilled into my mind as punishment after having to run/do extra work after making mistakes on sports teams. \n\nFrom that day on I started going everyday. I loved the pain to much to stop and continued going throughout highschool. Easy to say the effects were more noticeable by senior year. Occasionally people would compliment but in the end nothing changed, I was just a fit version of the past incel, a gymcel. \n\nGoing off to college I got even more involved in the fitness life, tracking intake, eating extremely healthy, and not partaking in typical college activities. My social skills were still shit as I\u2019d always been outcast in the early years. As time passed, the depression weakened but still remained. One day I said fuck it, and decided to do steroids and wow did they make a difference. The physical differences were amazing. I was already lean but the drugs gave the fullness which really made it pop. The testosterone brought in more facial hair and even seemed to make me appear more masculine with less facial fat and by really bring out my jawline. Being in a southern university with the culture of pounding beers every night made it extremely easy to stand out among the students. I would occasionally go out to the college bar strip and it was like shooting fish in barrel, I didn\u2019t even have to try. Women would come up and talk to me first. I managed to have plenty of short flings but nothing ever became of it. I\u2019ll go through women frequently, fitting the \u201cchad\u201d label however the reasoning is different. Unlike the portrayed \u201cchad\u201d who is trying to up his body count, deep inside I still have the FA incel like mind. I\u2019ve never felt any sort of connection with any of the women, it feels no different than talking to and fucking a doll. In the end I ditch the women as despite the circumstances, the chad jawline, and jacked body; I still believe I\u2019m destined to never feel Love and die alone.", "subreddit": "ForeverAlone"}

I loved him since high school, never told him because I didn't want to compromise our friendship. I don't make friends. I don't know where he even cane from. But he was one of 2 friends that I had all through highschool. I wasn't going to risk it. Tempting fate and teetering on the edge of the unknown.\n\nThere's another reason I never told him too.

He mentions a girlfriend. I avoid him for months. I had reached my breaking point.  After I'm done being a coward and ignoring my best friend, I hunt him down and hang with him. This would be the last time I would see him until yesterday. The last time in 4 painful years.\n\nI had a dream he died the day before yesterday. As a result of that dream, and a few other factors, I hunted him down through the internet. The only way I could find him was through YouTube of all places, but I got him nonetheless. We talked for 6 1/2 hours straight. We talked like we never stopped. He talked about some white girl he says he loves. Fuck it. I told him everything. No reciprocation. What a shock /s. But he... commended me for telling him. Said he already knew. I wasn't shocked about that either. I'm obvious. \n\nI told him everything. I told him that he was the only person I've ever liked. He really is too. So many guys have tried me. I've never felt anything towards anyone else. Never, not once. I told him that he can do whatever he likes (of course, I would never impose). And I told him that I would be happy alone, and I would chose it before I chose anyone but him in a heartbeat. And that's exactly what I feel. Always have.\n\nThen we continued our conversation, which was great btw. So, yeah, I'm going to die alone.\n\nTL;DR\n\nAfter years of suppression, I told my best friend, the only person I've ever loved, that I love him.

I have been a silent member of this community for close to one year I guess.\n\nI'm a 20 year old male and recently joined college. My life so far has been almost completely horrible, with only a few moments of happiness here and there. I don't look normal at all. I suffer from 4 of the most common facial defects : hemifacial microsomia, microtia, cleft lip and cleft palate. I look so weird that it's fucking tough for me to even go outside because everyone fucking stares like I am some goddamn alien from some planet. Oh wait, I have actually been called that numerous times along with other titles in my childhood (side note: whoever says that kids are the most innocent people out there needs to get a reality check). I fucking hate my life, and have actually attempted suicide thrice so far but each time I backed out at the last moment.  I don't have anyone to vent my problems to. It's not that I don't have friends, because miraculously I do have 3 close friends, but they have gotten tired of my depressed self too so I just pretend that everything is sunshine and rainbows when I'm with them. \n\nFew days ago one of my close friends who recently came out of a relationship told me that she has possibly started liking a friend (let's call him Y) whom she befriended one month ago. (Full disclosure: the close friend is actually a friend with whom I have been in love with for 4 years. Ain't life beautiful guys and gals?). And she was just telling me about why she thinks she might be falling for him and almost all of the points were my characteristics. Example: she's actually thinking of quitting social media completely to focus on her studies. Y reacted in exactly the same way as I did when she told him that. Another example: Y has sometimes stayed up till 2 am to help her (I was thinking 'hellooo? I have stayed up whole nights as a best friend for u more than a dozen times when u needed help) Final and the most kicker example: some of our (meaning Y's and mine) classmates have actually said that we are copies of each other personality wise. Only difference is he looks completely normal while I look like a complete retard. And everyone says looks don't matter :P\n\nI have been feeling so pathetic and unworthy for the past 10-12 hours and feel like my lungs can't take enough air. It has been one week since I joined college and the social experience so far has been complete shit. I get completely ignored by everyone (even my roommates) wherever I go. I seriously don't know what is there left to live for. To be honest, I go to bed close to every night wishing that I never wake up, that an earthquake or whatever kills me in my sleep. And often times, I catch myself staring wistfully at the edge of the terrace of my dorm. I don't feel like I can go on like this for the whole of my life, pretending to be a person who is happy in life and not depressed at all.\n\n I will be really grateful if anyone can tell me what to do in this situation.

I don't want one just because everyone else does, but the fact that everyone else has one made me realize that it's not normal to be my age and not have a single girl that liked you.\n\nPlease don't tell me that \"It'll happen\". You can't gurantee that. It's a fact that not everybody ends up with someone.\n\nHere's what happened with every girl I had a crush on:\n\n1. First girl I told I liked her was in 7th grade. I thought she liked me, and she did not. I was sad for a while, sure, but I wasn't depressed, and I was able to be classmates with her in 8th grade with no problems. After all, it was just 1 girl, and one would definitely like me eventually. .... right?\n2. Second girl. Also a classmate. I asked her to hang out outside of school, and she agreed. We did. A week later I asked again, but she was busy. Ok, fair enough. About half a week passes and I ask again, she leaves me on read. A month later I hear at school that she now has a boyfriend.\n3. Girl I'm friend with (X) (or girl I'm *maybe* friends with. I'll get to that) told me that a girl she knows (Y) that goes to my school asked her if she knows any guys that go to that school, and she told her about me. The girl comes to me at school and asks me if I know X. I say yes. We talk for a bit and I got her Facebook. Then she wouldn't even say hi whenever I'd say hi to her on the hallways, so eventually I just stopped saying hi as well.\n4. Went to a friend's birthday. I knew one person besides him that was there, that being X, but everyone else, I didn't know. There was this girl there who talked with me, and said that she thinks we're the only normal ones at that birthday party. At one point I was sitting on the couch, and she was standing next to it, and she puts her hand on my shoulder. Later, she starts filming some guys from the party (they asked her to), and I was right behind her when she did that. She turned around and filmed me for a few seconds before continuing to film what she was supposed to be filming. I wouldn't have had the courage to ask for her number normally, but X asked her to give it to her, which made me ask her as well, as it wasn't out of nowhere anymore. I texted her 2 days later, but I could tell from the way she was replying that she didn't want to talk to me and most likely found it weird that I had even texted her in the first place.\n5. This girl keeps coming in our classroom, as she's friends with a classmate of mine. I was watching an anime in between classes, and she came to talk to her friend, and saw I was watching anime. She asked what anime it was. I told her, but then she left. Another day, I was playing a game based on an anime, and she came to ask me what game it was, and asked me a bit about the mechanics of it and stuff. She told me she watches anime as well and we talked for a bit about it. I see her on the hallway one day, and I ask her what her Facebook is (we only talked about anime that one time, and neither of us actually introduced ourselves. I couldn't have searched her on Facebook even if I wanted to, because I didn't know her name). I didn't plan on asking her to hang out or anything. I just wanted to get her Facebook so we can talk about anime some more, at least for now. She replied with \"I have a boyfriend.\" And this made me really confused as to why she talked to me in the first place. She was the one who initiated both times. And it's not that she just wanted to be friends since we both watch anime either, because if that were the case, why wouldn't she give me her Facebook and become friends, instead of directly jumping to \"I have a boyfriend\" and leaving.\n6. This girl there wasn't really anything to indicate that she liked me. It was more of a shot in the dark, and sure enough, she didn't like me.\n7. This other girl I liked from my class left me on read when all I did was say \"Hi\". I didn't bother trying with her anymore, as it was obvious.\n8. And this last one (also a classmate) is the one that really solidified my belief of girls never liking me. Because she acted like she did. It's not even me misinterpreting things because I like her either, because a classmate as well as a guy I know, who's not even in our class, both asked me if her and I were going to date. It was obvious to them as well. She would hug me, always tease me, talk to me a lot, saying things that kind of implied us dating, and I could carry on listing things she did that made me believe she liked me all day. I asked her to hang out twice. Both times she said she was busy. I told her to let me know when she'll be free, and she didn't even open the message. She didn't leave me on read, she just straight up didn't open the conversation. She changed her profile picture after I sent her that message, so she was, indeed, online. I let some months pass and I asked her again. She said yes this time. We were meant to meet on Tuesday, but she said we'll talk about it (like the time, and location) at school on Monday. Monday comes and she doesn't say a word to me. Nothing about that or about anything else. I text her later that day to ask her about the next day, and she says she can't because her grandma is in the hospital. Whetever that's true or not, I don't know at this point, but even if it is true, why didn't she tell me anything at school? Heck, had I not texted her, Tuesday would've came without me knowing if we were even meeting anymore or not. Two months ago I just wanted to get it over with and I just straight up asked her if she liked me. She doesn't.\n\nHow would I even be able to realize that a girl likes me? The last girl did everything you could tell me to look out for, and she didn't like me either. A girl could act in the most obvious way in the world and I wouldn't be able to believe that she likes me, because of what happened with the last girl. I've heard lots of stories about guys being oblivious that girls like them. But can you blame them, if there are girls out there being obvious about it not because they like them, but because they want attention? I can't blame those guys for thinking they don't like them even if they're obvious about it.\n\nAnd even if the stars aligned and somehow I would get a girlfriend, it wouldn't last. I have OCD, dandruff (regardless of what I wash my hair with, it doesn't go away) and also, back when I finished sixth grade, I had some personal issues regarding anxiety, and I didn't go to school for 2 years. I do go now, but I'm two grades lower than I was meant to be. The moment this hypothetical girlfriend would find out about these things, she'd leave. I mean why would she want to date a guy with all these problems when, within a week at most, she could get someone else? It wouldn't even make sense to keep dating me when there are so many other guys around that don't have these issues.\n\nEveryone tries to convince me that I'm wrong, and it honestly pisses me off. It really just seems that unless someone is in my position, they can't understand. My psychiatrist's son is at the same school as I am (but not the same class), and she's telling me about his girl classmates and how I should try talking to them. What she doesn't understand is that it's not that simple for a guy. Unless you're really attractive (though to be honest, I don't consider myself ugly, but clearly girls do and it's their opinion about my looks that matter when it comes to whetever or not they'll date me or not, not my own opinion), it's not that simple. I can't randomly walk up to someone I don't know and start talking to them. They'd think I'm creepy. And since I wouldn't know anything about that person, the conversation would end after \"Hi\" \"Hi\", since I would have no idea what to say next. If they'd even reply to the \"Hi\" in the first place, that is. Most likely they'd get creeped out that a stranger is talking to them and they'd just walk away to laugh with her friends about the weird guy that talked to her out of nowhere.\n\nOne of my friends, after *he* broke up with his girlfriend, claimed to understand how I feel, because he too thinks girls won't like him. You know... despite the fact that he had a girlfriend that *he* ended things with, *and* not even two months later he's dating someone else. Yeah dude, we're absolutely in the same boat /s.\n\nAnd speaking of friends, it doesn't seem like I have those anymore either. I have 3 friends. Two of which are also friends with each other. The guy I mentioned in the previous paragraph keeps making excuses not to hang out with me. Probabily doesn't have time for the lonely guy now that he has a girlfriend again. I thought this summer break we'd meet more often since we don't have school. Yeah... no. Since summer break started, we met a grand total of two times.\n\nAs for the two that are also friends with each other, earlier this year they made another friend, and since then it was always just the three of them hanging out, never inviting me, despite the fact that all 4 of us watch anime, so it's not like I wouldn't be able to relate or contribute to the topics they'd be talking about. Recently they had an argument with the new friend, so they called me to hang out. We met just once this entire summer break, right after they got angry at the new friend. I'm just the backup friend, the one they keep just close enough that I don't cut ties with them, but just far away enough that they only invite me to hang out if there's no better option to invite.\n\nWhy would a girl like me if not even my \"friends\" want to hang out with me anymore?\n\nAnd if I don't get a girlfriend during my teens, I won't get one later either. It's considered odd to have never had a girlfriend by the time you're an adult. Even if someone were to be interested to me later on in life, they wouldn't date me when they realize that I have no idea what I'm doing, because I didn't have a relationship before. They'd think that if I got to that age and not a single girl liked me, they must've had a reason, and they'll stay away as well.", "subreddit": "lonely"}

We'd be the guy with whom she \"doesn't have to try as hard\", which really just means that she's not going to invest as much as she usually does. Where her ex got cute messages at work, saying that she misses him and can't wait to see him later, we're going to get a shopping list.

The last 8 years of my life have been a lie.  I can not say that I do now or have ever loved my wife romantically.  I mean from our wedding night until today sex has felt more like a job I am supposd to do rather  than something I want to do.  Sometimes its hard to even think of myself as capable of love.  I know that I am but that ability is trapped under a thin vernier of who I am supposed to be and years of mistrust and anger.  Somehow last week I managed to dig deep down inside and find that old me, only he does not recognize the world he is in right now.  I think my marriage and the relationship leading up to it were just like me on autopilot and now that I am waking up I dont know what to do.\n\nIts not like I don\u2019t try.  The problems are many.  She constantly takes her family\u2019s side against me in any dispute at least privately.  She always argues the other positon if someone is mad at me.  She always makes my bad days or bad things happening into how my reaction makes her feel hurt.  I feel like I have no one on my side and no one to ever lean on as it all gets turned back onto me.  This drives me away even more.  I honestly don\u2019t feel loved, not in the deeper sense of the word.  She really has zero interested in peeling through my layers because there is a lot of ugly.  She does not like ugly.  \n\nBut I want to live, the real me, the one buried for so long but after moving away from friends and my old life I have no one with any connection to who i used to be and no way to get back there.  I just live with the daily frustration of knowing there is the me inside yearning to be free and yet having no way of getting there and having no one to help.  \n\nI used to be driven, brilliant, passionate, loving, selfless, and a pure romantic wanting to see the possibility rather than the reality.  These days I am stuck in existing in cold hard reality.  \n\nI am in my 40s living in NJ and I have no idea how I got here.  At least not the real me.  I don\u2019t know what I seek other than help clawing my way through the dark layers and bringing this amazing person back to the forefront and actually living my life.   What that help can be, who can get inside me and truly get to know me, or what that help will look like I have no idea but I am putting it out there in case someone does.  \n\nYou see what needs to go is this vernier and then the darkness.  The darkness was snowballed by repeated betrayal and hurt and built on a core of childhood sexual abuse I don\u2019t even remember and only know by my knowledge of abusive sex from my very early childhood.  No I am not now or have ever been abusive but the thoughts of what abuse is lingers in my mind.  Back when it was manageable and just a safety mechanism to keep me from getting hurt I was good.  That is until I was betrayed and it became the driving force of my life.  I made sure I could never be manipulated again and over the years it killed my ability to even feel.  Recently I began to feel again and that old me isn\u2019t dead but waking from a coma.  But that old me, as I said, is lost in a world it doesn\u2019t belong in and without help I\u2019m afraid it will sleep again and I will never become who I once was.", "subreddit": "lonely"}

My entire life has been and endless cycle of getting my hopes up, being rejected, and falling into loneliness. People seem to enjoy my company for the most part, but I\u2019m never anyone\u2019s first priority. I don\u2019t get invited to anything by anyone or have many interactions outside of school. From the fourth grade to the tenth grade, I\u2019d always try to hang around groups of people at lunch period, futilely attempting to force myself into the group. While I may have spent my time with these people, I was never really part of the group or considered to be by the people of it. I always had one friend who was one of the \u201cpopular kids\u201d who has since changed schools and really shown a lack of interest in me. He was the one person I could always rely on to be around with at lunch time, and now that he left, I really have nothing. This was the final nail in the coffin. I\u2019ve tried to force my way into too many groups, and I\u2019ve since quit trying. Every new school year I would tell myself, \u201cThis year people will like you and you\u2019ll have lots of friends\u201d. However, when I went into the eleventh grade, I already had accepted that no group would include me. So, I spent my entire eleventh grade hanging around my new best friend: my locker. I\u2019m honestly a person people enjoy being around and I can make people laugh but no one seems to really care about that or about anything that has to do with me. As for the romantic side of my loneliness, there have been four women who I have had a particular fondness for. As you can probably guess, they all rejected me. All of these women showed at some point an interest in me, but ended up rejecting me in the end. I\u2019m not the type of person to like many women, I really only develop a fondness for a select few. Of course I\u2019m attracted to many women, but not in ways where I\u2019d want to really be in serious relationships with them. However, every time I attempt to have a relationship with a woman, I get rejected. I\u2019ve been told that I have to learn to love myself before I love others but that is not the issue. I am by no means depressed; I\u2019m not the type of person to get depressed. In fact, I really do love myself and I\u2019m the best friend I\u2019ll ever have. The issue is that no one seems to love me. I honestly despise the human need for relationship. If I could not have to worry about creating relationships, my life would be a lot easier. But, this loneliness I\u2019ve experienced my entire life eats away at my core. I\u2019ve just experienced my fourth rejection from a woman I grew very fond of, and it feels like she\u2019s ripped out the last piece of my heart I had to give out to someone. I\u2019ve given out my heart, but received none back. This has left me empty inside, like a hole developed in my stomach. Before this most recent rejection, I can\u2019t remember the last time I had cried from emotional or physical pain. It\u2019s not that I was holding it in, I just really am not the person who cries a lot. Recently, I\u2019ve been crying a lot more, and have accepted that I will likely not find many people, or anyone, who I will have a meaningful relationship with. As I enter my last year of high school, I am immensely excited to leave for University and meet a fresh new set of people. I can only pray that someone there has a connection with me and we can grow a relationship.

Now these are the two major inescapable aspects of every soul, the animal produces the intense passion that fuels every soul to act and the Transcendent is the aspect that charts the course. Let the feelings of your animal nature guide your transcendent, but keep the animal in check through the transcendent, this would be called morality. Explore your emotions and think about why you are feeling them, felling lonely is a natural mechanic of human survival, for obvious reasons, understand why you fell this why and do something to rectify the problem. Keep in mind though this is no easy task, escaping near total isolation is difficult and scary but having friends and relationships is so blissfully heaven compared to the hell of complete isolation, so allow yourself this heaven and go out in the world and make a change in your own soul, this is a hard journey, and you will fail over and over again but with each risk and fail you gain a new experience to learn from, understand why you failed and learn to avoid past mistakes. With each step you will slowly become a better human being and when you are falling through the pitch black ocean of despire dream of a greener tomorrow and remember the cold of yesterday, you can not go back to that cold, you must move forward, tomorrow must dawn. \n\nThat's cheesy but it works for me lmao", "subreddit": "lonely"}

Don't really want to be a burden.\n\nI have a whole to-do list that I made before she moved out, of things that I was going to do to keep my mind busy...but the list hasn't been touched since.  I come home from work and put on a record, lay down on the couch, fall asleep, wake up at like 7pm, cook dinner and eat it, then I go to bed.

I am ugly, I am dumb, I have no charisma, I am self-absorbed, I am obsessive, I have no social skills, I am boring, I am unfunny\u2026how will I ever not be alone when this is the case? Why would anyone ever be attracted to me? I wouldn\u2019t like me, that\u2019s for sure. I just have nothing that people would be attracted to, and it shows in my general life experience. Nobody has EVER been attracted to me, nobody has EVER liked me, none of my friends want to hang out with me, none of them value me or think I am funny or cool or interesting. I just want a hug, I want to be held, loved, kissed, I want someone to hold my face and tell me I am good, that I am ok, that they love me with all their heart. But of course, no, that is not for me. \n\nAnd why is that? Well, I know I am NOT entitled to love or romance or friendship or dating, I KNOW it is my responsibility to be good enough, but I DO NOT KNOW HOW. I try to work on my appearance-groom my eyebrows, style my hair, go to the gym; I got medication and therapy but it didn\u2019t work; I work really hard in school and at work but I have nothing to show for it\u2026why am I not good enough? What am I doing wrong? I don\u2019t get it, why must I be cursed to be alone for my whole life? I am, the evidence suggests, completely and utterly without value. If I had value then people would love me, they would want to hang out with me, then THEY would see value in myself. How can I have self-worth when nobody else sees me as having any worth either? Of course I seek validation and acceptance from my peers, I am human, and I cannot be happy if I am just completely bloody isolated my whole life for the sole reason that I\u2019m NOT GOOD ENOUGH TO GET PEOPLE TO LIKE ME!\n\nThere is someone, who ostensibly is one of my best friends, that I am utterly in love with, honestly to an unhealthy and obsessive amount at this point.

What did I do wrong? Why don\u2019t they even want to be friends with me anymore? I asked them out many months ago and even though they said no (again, I have no attractive features and am not good enough for her. It\u2019s all my fault for not being good enough and I don\u2019t know how I can be happy with this true) but we still remained fine friends and nothing seemed to have changed until recently. They are just perfect, how can I get over them? They are kind, beautiful, funny, thoughtful, caring, and so on, they have been my best(ish) friends for so long but I am still not good enough to be attractive to them. Not good enough to be attractive to anyone in fact, hell now I\u2019m apparently not even good enough to be their friend anymore! I don\u2019t know how to get over them, they are just perfect in almost every way, I love them so much I just want to hold her and say I love you I love you I love you and I want to be good enough for her. I think of her every time I close my eyes, the few times she bothers messaging me back these days are the only good parts of my day, just seeing a picture of her is like a shot of pure electricity, everything and everyone else pales in comparison, everything just seems grey and flat and empty except for her. I know I\u2019m not \u201centitled\u201d to her, I respect her feelings on the matter (though I wish she\u2019d at least tell me why she doesn\u2019t talk to me that much anymore tbh), but that doesn\u2019t make it suck any less when the person you love, more than you\u2019ve ever loved anyone before, does not think you are even worthy of friendship let alone love. Talking to her is the only time I feel alive these days, the only time I feel like I have purpose and reason to be alive, but I fucked it up by firstly not being good enough for her to love me back and secondly to not be good enough for her to want to be friends with me anymore, since apparently after 8 years of friendship I\u2019m not even worth an explanation as to what I\u2019m doing so wrong that she doesn\u2019t want to PLATONICALLY talk with me anymore like we were doing fine for months after I asked her out back in\u2026around early May?\n\nI want to be good enough, I want to apologise to everyone (especially *her*) for not being enough, for being worthless and shit and miserable and bitter and clingy and boring.

I've been lonely my entire life. I was never allowed a furry pet. I didn't grow up with a dog, a cat, or any mammal. A fish or a lizard does not bring companionship, and I was always desperate to spend time with friends.\n\nIt's something I've never been able to shake, that aching loneliness. My last relationship, my ex was part of a large, loving family and she was one of several siblings. I was elated to feel welcomed and be part of something I had only seen in movies. In contrast, my family is small, petty and dysfunctional. I had never seen so much love before, and I didn't think anyone would be able to love me as much as my last girlfriend. Things ended for a multitude of reasons, and I learned a lot about myself, and what I want in a partner. \n\nQueue now - I somehow got myself in a relationship a couple months ago with someone in their early twenties, after a two year hiatus. We are very different, but care about each other a lot. Lately I've been finding excuses to leave. Some of which are probably a culmination of my own insecurities and self destructive tendencies, but others which my intuition and deduction can't really ignore. Something feels off, and without going into too much detail, I don't think this is going to last. Her communication skills are deteriorating and I can't keep giving in to apologies and \"I love you's\".\n\nI'm doing well for myself, I have a career, I'm not in debt outside of a minor student loan and I don't really worry about money. I game a lot in my free time, I like nerdy stuff, fashion, sneakers and lately I've been putting in a lot of extra effort into my health - Short and long term.\n\nI'm not expecting you to like everything I like, or have the same experiences in life as me. I just wouldn't mind the company of another person who I click with - Male or female. Preferably people with their shit (mostly) together. An insightful potential friend who can pull me out of the void I tend to get sucked into more and more frequently.\n\nWelp, this probably came across far edgier than I planned.

But i wanted to share this self- introspection i gess.\n\n\nI am in mid twentys and to be honest i've always ALWAYS been single, when i was a young and started to like people romantically some boys were interested in me and sometimes i was inyerested in them but nothing really progressed.\n\n\nI reached highschool ,university and i didnt really find someone who i felt atracted physically and also liked as a person , there were a couple of men that  were fine in both aspects but had girlfriends so everything stayed as a plathonic friendship.\n\n\n\nI started to think... was sometjing wrong with me? Why i never get to interest someone i also liked too?? \n\n\n\nOne reason could be appearance, in that time i was fairly slim and while not beatiful also no one has ever refer to me as ugly, also i'ver never though myself ugly when looking at the mirror. Also when i used to go about the streets a fairly amount of men looked at me and smiled.\n\n\nSo.. what is ? I thought.. the other option is character.. and there is when is started to understand .  It is difficult to me to form bonds even with friends, i acted too serious by a lot of peoples points of view. Also i dont laugh easily and i was painfully awkward around these years so..it may be that.\n\n\n\nI cut it short. I didnt get it still until this year. I thought i was not so ugly to be unlovable but also  surely i was not so awkward/serious to be that the reason.\n\nUntil i found someone in my pre professional practices(last year of studies). I noticed him since the begining. He was a lot taller than almost all in the building. And also while not handsome or pretty his face was decent. \n\n\nSo i watched him from afar , never really interacting with him more than a greeting. \nWhen we both got to work together in the same group after 3 months  i was exited.\n\n\n\nAll the other atractive men either already have someone or i didn t likr them in terms of personality.\n\nAt first i tried to be smiling, always greeting him with a kiss to the cheek and trying to find ways to to touch him and spend time with him\n\nHe looked surprised the first day but shortly started too act happy with all of it, acting in a similar way.\n\nAfter the weeks passed i started to *really * get to know him. I dont want to be specific but after a month i realize i didn like him. It is mostly because i like to do things fast and not tarry while working , i do my best to do things well and fast.\n\n\nAnd he is one of those people who always take the time with times. Always calm and ..... slow. I dont have other way to say it.\n\n\n\nI did realize that while being atracted to him initially (because he looked fine), while getting to know him ... his personality just did not appeal to me.\n\n\nSpending time with him turned tiresome so when new groups were formed i was okay with not working with him anymore.\n\nSo there is\n\n\n  SELF KNOWLEDGE\n\n\n\n I think mostly being a FA is because MY personality is unappealing. and that makes me feel empty.

Yes, loser, nice guy, incel, neckbeard, virgin, whatever pill is popular, and almost all names have been used on me already.\n\nTonight at work, it was busy. I didn't have much time to think because I was trying to keep the seemingly endless line moving. It did get less busy for about 15 minutes. In that time this attractive woman becomes next in line. I'm too busy to care who it is. I still notice her looking at me in a grossed out way. Her eyes told me eww, I don't want to be helped by you. I thought maybe I was just being paranoid. I get that look at the time. It doesn't mean she wouldn't want to even be helped by me. I'm finishing with the person in front of her and she has a large order. I know her transaction will take longer than normal due the amount of items she has. The person in front walks away and this woman basically says nope and runs away.\n\nThe first thing I thought to myself was, she just forgot something and went to get it. There is no way a woman would literally wait until it got busy enough to where she could have my manager help her. My manager is a middle aged woman. Once again, she gets back in line but this time it's longer. I am about to call for help but I notice most people in line only have a couple of things and I can get the line down fast enough so I don't have to call the manager. She has work to get done and I know she doesn't want to be bothered. \n\nI get the line down to once again, a person and her. She was next and just as I was done with the person in front of her, she gave me that look of disgust again. Well, I'm the only person who can help her so she's going to have to put up with me. I didn't purposely try to help her. I was the only employee there besides my manager. We are usually short handed in The Summer. Once again, as the person in front of her started to walk away, she turns around and walks away.\n\nA few minutes later I get a bigger line. I had to call the manager. She comes up and we start to get the line down. As it gets down to just a couple of people she runs up behind the person my manager is helping. There is one line so she technically cut in line but nobody cared. My manager helped her and she left. \n\nMaybe I'm paranoid. Maybe I give off incel vibes or whatever else outisders tell me. I'm dressed well because I have to. I had showered before work like usual. There was nothing unusual about me. The odds that twice she noped out of the line before interacting with me only to cut in line just to make sure she's helped by my manager was a coincidence are very low. \n\nI know people will try to use the just world fallacy on me. You will tell me I looked at her in a certain way made her uncomfortable. It isn't the way I look. Nobody is ugly. Maybe she was able to detect my thoughts of hatred. The problem is, we were so busy I was just thinking of getting through the busy evening. It didn't matter to me that she was a tall, blonde, who is conventionally attractive even though I did notice it. It didn't matter because I get lots of attractive woman customers. I don't treat them differently because that would be unprofessional. An hour later a woman who is conventionally average looking came in and after she laughed at my small talk, she became the most attractive woman I helped tonight. It still doesn't matter. Everyone gets the same service. If you are nice to me, I will go out of my way to help you no matter who you are. Tonight, I ascended from being a wizard. I'm in a new category.\n\nMy powers continued when a woman coworker I haven't seen in a while came in. I always got the vibe she disliked me but told me she has no problem with me. My manager and I were talking when she came in. She went up to my manager and said hi. I said hi but she ignored me. I asked how have you been, and she ignored me instead turning back to talk to with my manager. After I got the signal that I wasn't paranoid and she really dislikes me, I backed off. If I angered her, I don't remember what I did. I treated her like any other coworker. Maybe she also has the ability to see my FA'ness that I try to hide. My other woman coworkers and coworkers who are men all talk to me. Even the ones that I don't get along with very well still talk to me. The woman tonight hasn't said anything to me in weeks. I haven't seen her much but every time I see her and say hi, she looks away. After the first time that was when I asked her if I had offended her. She said no, why would you think that.

If I cannot truthfully describe my partner as 'sexy', at an age where it is **completely acceptable and normal** to find your partner sexy (I am 24), then I am not actually in a relationship, I am simply LARPing.

It was a scary experience and not something I'd wish anyone to go through. Along with a variety of other personal issues, one is a haunting sense of loneliness, an emptiness inside, and outside all I see is emptiness. I don't have any close friends but one online friend has been there for me throughout, and she helped me by communicating regularly on WhatsApp and talking me through my day.\nI'd stopped eating and was shaking and sweating, spending my nights curled up on the couch in the dark, crying and feeling uncomfortable all over. There was no escape from the pain, although I tried with weed and alcohol every night for months. Then I broke. It began with me crying in my kitchen, alone, because I didn't know what to do with myself. I wanted to scratch out the pain from my mind and body. If only it was tangible. Then I broke and I picked up an oak kitchen chair and smashed it into the tiles on the kitchen floor. Then I ran up the stairs, clenching my head, pulling at my matted hair, sobbing hysterically. I threw myself into the bed and cried like I've never cried before, then I had a panic attack. I contacted my parents out of pure fear and they helped me. They've helped me so much these past few days and I'm finally starting to eat again. They've also offered me a room at their place, in case I need to stay over and have some general company. That meant a lot. I stayed there last night and just loved doing nothing but watching TV with my folks and actually having a real conversation with someone during the evening.

{"post_id": "cndac6", "created_utc": 1565219856, "title": "Reflecting on Myself", "author": "GlassRivers", "self_text": "So I think its fair to say that I'm lonely by choice most of the time. I get tired really quickly being around other people and find that I'm able to achieve more by being on my own. And I am comfortable with that. I see my friends infrequently and I think that's good for everyone because I have a personality that's best experienced in small doses.\n\nI'm turning 23 in 4 months though and thought I'd reflect a bit on some thoughts I've been having. I've never been an attractive person. In the last few years I became average in that area, got rated as a 6 on the /truerateme and /rateme subreddits which I'm ok with. Due to my lifestyle I don't meet many women and don't interest many of the few I do meet. I have some issues regarding these kind of connections.\n\nWhen I was in year 8 at school I saw all my friends around me starting to experiment with relationships and I remember being really scared by that, by the thought that everyone around me would have all these experiences that I wouldn't. To act quickly I did something I hate my former self for, I asked out a girl I knew liked me but I didn't like. I quickly realized my mistake though and as per many middle school relationships it ended after a week. I could shrug this off as one of the silly things kids do, but my best friend (who still is my best friend to this day) never let me forget that mistake. Every so often he would make me feel so much shame and embarrassment over asking this girl out (one reason was because he and my other friends thought she was very unattractive and so were cruel about that, and also because of the way I handled that). I think the consistent reminders of that experience kind of stunted my growth when it came to those sort of things. I didn't ask out anyone else in school out of the shame I still felt from that experience. \n\nI also remember when we got to highschool what started to happen to people I would say were in my level of the social hierarchy. A lot of the unattractive boys started to become creepy, I think over their own lack of success with girls. These were the sort of people who started sending dick pics to girls as well as other unwanted behaviour. I remember telling myself I couldn't become like them ever. So I cut myself off from any thoughts about dating or any of those feelings.\n\nI finished school exactly as my year 8 self thought I would. All my friends around me had dated many different people and were experienced and comfortable with that part of their life while I held mine at a very far distance from myself. I hated myself for that. For a few years after that I tried doing what I was expected to do. I tried studying at uni which didn't work for me (I was sick of studying after I took my last few years of school very seriously). I dropped out and got a job in a little retail shop for 10 months, just to save money. This was a bad year for me. I worked 6 days a week and on that one day off I drank all day. Was miserable for most of it.\n\nThen something happened I didn't expect. I was working one busy day and these 3 people came into the shop. Two girls and a tall guy. I didn't notice them at all as I was busy with other customers at the counter but eventually they got to me. I remember saying some joke or funny comment to one of the girls (For some reason I found it so easy to flirt, be funny when I was putting on my customer service persona) and she laughed but I didn't think anything of it. She left and I continued on with my day. \n\nThat night I was drinking again because the following day was my day off. I was kind of tipsy when I got a facebook friend request from someone I didn't know. No mutual friends or anything. This happens sometimes out of the blue and most of the time I reject these just because I don't like adding people I don't know (I only have like 40 friends on FB). But because I was drinking, I thought I'd see who this person was. Turned out it was the girl from earlier that day. She had found me through some A-Level FB stalking, after the receipt she got from the store had my name printed as the person who put her order through. We spoke for a few hours and she decided to come see me again at work. This was awkward as hell but pretty cute, and we arranged to hang out one afternoon.\n\nI didn't really know what to do about this. I didn't know what people did on dates as I had never been on one (I was 19 at this point). I decided to get a rose because I'm a total fuckwit. When it came time to leave I was embarrassed about this and cut the rose down to just the flower so I could conceal it in my hand and get rid of it easily in case I thought it was stupid. We met up and went for a walk around a nearby lake. Eventually she saw the rose in my hand and there was this beat where we both looked at each other and then both burst out laughing. After that it was pretty perfect. We spoke easily, make jokes, and enjoyed each others company, all while walking around this lake that was shining with the afternoon sun. We eventually found a place to sit as the sun went down and I absentmindedly picked the petals off the rose and let the wind scatter them across the water. It was very picturesque.\n\nAnyway, I dated this girl for a month and a bit, had a couple of more dates and is still the only girl I've ever kissed. Also the only girl I can ever say I've ever felt anything for. It didn't work out for us due to some complicated circumstances. I realized that due to my lack of experience with dating, I had some issues. First of all, that guy she was with when she entered the shop the first time was her ex-boyfriend. She still hung around him which I told myself was fine even though it made me uncomfortable. These feelings only got worse when she told me some stuff about how he really missed her, came around to her house and cried, how she let him into her house and some of the suggestive stuff he asked her to do. Eventually I asked her if this was likely to stop. She said that it probably wouldn't and that was that. I never spoke to her after that.\n\nI left that job after 10 months to go and travel Europe for 5 months in 2017. That was fun but I didn't meet anyone like all my friends said I would. The friend I went with hooked up with a couple of people but I just never manage to do that and honestly don't like the idea of hooking up with people. I feel like if its not a relationship, I can't do it. After I got back I got a job in hospitality and started studying at uni again, which is where I am now. Studying teaching. I've always loved being around kids. They make me remember the fun in life. In that hospitality job I had a few people who took an interest in me but I didn't like any of them back. I've started using some dating apps to see what they're like but nothing ever happens on them for me. I get a few matches and like from girls but I can't converse with them. I don't know how to flirt and be playful through text. \n\nTwo days ago I matched with a girl who I would consider pretty far out of my league. We spoke for a few hours (I didn't really feel much chemistry through those texts though). One of the things she told me was that she was sick of immature guys on these dating apps and that kind of got to me because I don't consider myself anywhere near as mature as I should be. I'm a 22 year old uni student still living at home looking for a job. Don't have a car and don't do much with my life. So I told her why I thought I wouldn't be a good match for her, and unmatched her. \n\nSorry if that's a lot to read, I just felt the need to reflect on my experiences with loneliness. I am comfortable being alone, truthfully. Its just that I get these days where I feel empty because of it. I've got a difficult personality for people to get used to, as I'm very cold to people I meet for the first time and very distant for a long time after that.", "subreddit": "lonely"}

He\u2019s had a few online relationships that he gets super wrapped up in, but it always ends in heartbreak.  He\u2019s from Australia and he met a girl from Florida on VR chat.  A real pretty girl too.  He was with her for a few weeks until she decided that the distance between them was too much; neither of them had the money to come see each other.  My friend was devastated.  At one point he was seeing a married woman (online, she was American) who was in marriage counseling with her husband.  She basically told him that if things don\u2019t work out with her and her husband that she would be with him.  I told my friend to break it off, that he deserves better than to be someone\u2019s second choice.  Eventually she broke up with him and he went spiraling into depression again.  Recently he\u2019s met another married woman online (American, go figure) that he says he has feelings for and wants to pursue something with.  I\u2019m just like, here we go again smh.  \n\nI want to just tell him that if he would just get in shape, get a therapist to help him stop self loathing, and try to meet women in his area then he would find someone easily.  But I know that\u2019s way easier said than done and honestly I don\u2019t think he\u2019s in a place right now to put in that kind of effort and I\u2019m afraid he never will be.", "subreddit": "ForeverAlone"}

If I'm not working, studying, or in class, I typically am at home browsing the internet or playing guitar. I don't go on vacations, go on adventures, go to the beach, etc. I don't even know how to plan vacations? I am trying, though.

I usually can\u2019t get any sleep because of my anxiety. I get so scared something will happen to me and I will die. I try to distract myself but it only gets worse. My family could never understand me and I have no one but 1 distant friend. I rarely see him and feel so disconnected with him. I recently just came out as gay to him and it was one of my biggest mistakes I ever made. I hate being gay so telling someone after being questioned about it sucks. I despise myself so much. I try to make jokes with my friend about it now but I just feel so stupid that I\u2019m the weird one. I know being gay is wrong but it\u2019s all I\u2019ve ever known. Even beyond my medical problems growing up(having a trach), I tried my best to be outgoing and fun. I used to be as happy as I could fake myself to be. I just can\u2019t do it anymore and I found little enjoyment in this life. I\u2019m 20 and have had no one to care for me all my life. Family talks behind my back and calls me gay and/or some loser whose never had a girlfriend, unlike my star football player older brother. Knowing my family hates what I am fuels my inner rage even more. I feel so dirty yet I can\u2019t stop what I am. I have never been with anyone &amp; I am so scared of being intimate yet it\u2019s what I crave. I really don\u2019t want to get on a sketchy app and meet up with some old guy for him to blow me in the park at 2 AM. However, I am just so untouched and depressed(I know that sounds weird). I am so alone in this world it seems. My acne medication is at least working so I am able to look at my reflection for more than 5 seconds(not kidding).", "subreddit": "lonely"}

This voice tells you how to act, tells you what to say, tells you how to feel. This voice. Is you. Its your conscience. Life is an endless conversation with yourself. As your reading these words off of this screen, they are being read in your head, in your voice. Now that your self aware of that little voice in your head you can notice it more. You can stop and think \"damn theres actually a voice in my head\" \nNow when you are around people, this voice, is filtered. Whether around friends, family, or strangers, this voice in your head is constantly telling you how to act based on who your with. Be funny. Tell a joke. Small talk. Dont do anything weird. \nIts also processing all the information it is being given around it. The thing is. No one can hear your voice. No one can read your thoughts. No matter who you are with, they will never know what you are thinking. That voice in your head is private. It has the freedom of expressing itself however it wants in your head because no one can see it. When you judge someone and think to yourself \"damn they look ugly with that new haircut\" you know they can't hear that voice, but out of respect you dont tell them that, you give them a lil compliment and move along with your day.\nOk so.\nWhen you are entirely alone. Completely by yourself. Home alone with the certainty that no one is around and no one is watching. You are in private.\nThat little voice in your head, no longer has to be filtered. \nIt has the freedom to physically and verbally express itself. \nIt is the realist version of you. \nAnd it only shows when you are alone. \nEveryone acts different once behind closed doors because they no longer have anything holding them back. \nNo one knows the real you. Only you do.\nOnly you know how you act when you are alone. \nBecause thats when your true conscience shows.\nSo my wondering is, does a constant, more time alone, (although not good for the mental healty) allow you to learn more about who you are, become more at peace with yourself, and if possible, allow you to mature into who you truly are?

I spend around 6 hours travelling every day. I know that's not an awful amount of time but in my case it just feels pointless because I could just stay home and do what I'm doing in the city. I can't stay home though because my father is an abusive piece of shit and now he's there literally 24/7. I can't wait to get my own place and finally stop having to be around him but right now I can't do that because I'm trying to finish my degree and I don't drive (I'm 26, yeah I know, I should work on that. I'm just too anxious and even if I got the license I wouldn't have the money for a car at the moment). I don't know what I'm saying. I'm just staring at the screen like a moron feeling hopelessly alone and just hopeless in general. I've always been a loner, ever since I was a kid. I felt scared of people and I didn't want to hang with the other kids. All the friends I've ever had were people who approached me first. I never walk up to people to chat because I worry I'll be bothering them and my presence will upset them. The friends I have irl are currently all too far to meet up so basically I'm completely alone most of the time. Even when I'm home with my brother or just outside or something with other people around, I feel completely alone and isolated. I don't go out to party because 1) I grew up in a restrictive and oppressive household so I didn't get to party in my teens at all and 2) I don't have anyone to go with now that I technically could try it out. I don't feel comfortable hanging out with people I don't know too well. I have some serious trust issues and I'm well-aware of that but there's not much I can do about it. Even over the internet, I may talk a lot but when you squeeze what I'm saying, you'll get nothing at all from it. It's like when you have to write an essay and you have information for maybe 100 words when you need 1000 and you write: 'The ball of hydrogen and helium burning at around 10,000 degrees that shines in the sky every day and many forget is a star as much as Polaris, the star generally known as the North Star. The closest star to the Earth and the only star in the Solar System, which is part of the Milky Way, the spiral galaxy where our planet dwells.' when you could just write 'the sun' and it'd be enough. There's a lot of information in what I say but no point in it being there. I don't know if that makes sense. This is what I mean. What am I even saying? There's a lot in this post already but is anyone following? I'm constantly digressing and that's a problem. I don't know why I do it. I have ADHD and that's most likely one of the reasons. The point is that I'm alone, everything I do feels pointless, I'm terrified of the future, and being alone for so long and not truly trusting anyone enough to willingly be vulnerable in front of them has fucked me up so badly I feel like I'm a scattered person with scattered thoughts. I have zero motivation to the things I used to like to do and I'm struggling so much to finish my dissertation, I fear I won't be able to get it done on time. I feel like I've never ever been completely honest with anyone about what I truly feel and who I really am. I look at people and I see them form meaningful connections with others while I'm forever the friend who walks behind on the sidewalk. Nobody believes me when I tell them that I've known these ladies from the commute for years and they actively engage me in conversation but only recently did they realize they didn't know my name. I was just 'sugar' the whole time. The friends I have irl tell me that they miss me when we talk but I just feel like a nuisance and a bore. I never have anything to share because I never do anything interesting. It doesn't help that I'm queer in the forgotten west where the sun always shines but you can't see shit except your own damn shadow ahead of you when it's hitting you from the back and scorching your nape. I don't know, I feel less miserable at night when the sun's out. I really hate the sun and I can't stand the brightness. I guess it's because people can see me in it. They can see my stupid face and how disgusting it looks. \n\nI debated making a throwaway for this but I figured I can't be bothered. Anyway, yeah. That's it. Some of it. None of it.

Somehow, within the last few hours, my Instagram account went all wonky and I could view messages from people who had blocked me (or vice versa). I pulled up an old one that made me sigh, because it reminded me of something that's happened to me too many times.\n\nIt was from the last woman I had a chance of pursuing a romantic/sexual relationship with. I felt I could just about die when she mentioned she was interested in having such a relationship with me. We had enjoyed such a warm friendship over the previous year that I definitely saw it happening. But then, after the interest was expressed, our friendship slowed down. Increasingly, my messages were being answered less. I asked her if something was wrong, \n\nThen came those fatal words: \"I want to get to know you better first.\"\n\nThese words shouldn't be fatal \u2013 hell, they should be an opportunity. But I couldn't help but notice that, no matter what I did to propose avenues for her to get to know me better, she responded ambivalently (if she responded at all). Mind you, I wasn't doing this desperately; I was simply doing it enough to indicate the interest was still there. One night, after days of waiting for her to answer a text, I snapped. I did what is probably one of the most \"asshole\" moves I've ever been guilty of. Knowing I had literally nothing to lose, I sent her a message saying, \"Oh, can't be bothered answer my texts? Your loss, really.\" She sent me an angry reply that I could barely understand (it read like a drunk text), and then I blocked her.\n\nThis is just one example, but it's been too common in my life when I've pursued women. *I want to get to know you better!* Okay, that's a fair position to take. So why is there then visible discomfort when I, oh, you know, **try to help her get to know me better?!** I used to pursue the \"I want to get to know you better\" line of inquiry with intent, but now, I give up way more easily than I used to.\n\nIf someone *actually* wants to get to know you, they don't make it difficult. If they make it difficult, then it's obvious you weren't good enough to begin with. I'm using this example in my pursuit of female romantic/sexual partners, but it's true for both sexes; as well as in pursuing romantic, sexual, platonic, professional, etc., connections.\n\nSuch is yet another facet of being FA. :(", "subreddit": "ForeverAlone"}

I don't know what to expect, but I know its going to be the biggest opportunity I'll have for a long time. I've already sent emails to like 15 different clubs; its such a luxury to have all these chances at interaction before me to choose from. If one club isn't doing it for me, I can try another; there's no reason to be desperate anymore. \n\nBut yet, I can't shake what she said, and it pisses me off because a new era is just around the corner, and I can't feel excited for it. I'm sure that'll change once I get there. But there's nothing taking this badge of shame off right now. \n\nI dreamed of somehow sticking it to her, displaying that she was wrong by simply being too preoccupied to care, whether it be through a social life, my hobbies, both. It's not possible, I'll likely never see her again. But then the thought occurred to me that maybe its not so much about proving something to her, but proving something to myself. This past year and a half has been my worst so far, but I feel I've done a good job rising above most of the bad. This loneliness is the last shred of it, and I'm confident I can make it go away.\n\nWish me luck.", "subreddit": "lonely"}

I'm 5+ years in into my Master's program, which normally takes 3-3.5 years. So I don't have any friends here, all my friends have graduated and moved on. I'm not in contact with any of them because I'm ashamed to admit to them that I'm still in school, even though it's not completely my fault. I don't speak much with the current students here because I don't feel like letting them know that I'm still at school for so long.\n\nMy relationship has hit rocky waters since the last two months. She was the only one I have been speaking to every day on the phone, for the last two years, since we started dating. Now, she never calls, and I keep yearning for her to call. If I call, she doesn't answer, and if she does, doesn't seem that interested to talk. All of this due happened due to a fight we had two months back where we didn't speak for a week. At the end of that week, she just texts me and says \"I'm done\". I've been begging her to explain my side of things every day since then, but she doesn't listen.\n\nI know I'm supposed to focus on my thesis so I can graduate this fall, but because of this relationship stuff, I can barely do anything all day except sit and think, or sit and cry. I live alone, so every night when I go home, I end up crying, even if I don't want to.\n\nOnly my mom has wished me today. My dad doesn't speak to me and my mom. Ever since I was born, he has never lived with us. He used to come visit me on my birthdays when I was young, but that stopped many many years back. He's never wished me on my birthday ever since. Forget that, he never even calls me up.\n\nAll of this, I can handle. But what hurts the most is the relationship stuff. I tried so hard to make her smile every day, and now she doesn't even bother to wish me on my birthday? I called her myself at midnight, when she didn't wish me. She said she had fallen asleep. \n\nI'm so lonely. I'm crying right now as I write this, sitting in the library on campus. I'm tired of this life.

He suggested this person in good faith and my response to him was as follows.\n\n\"Yes but it's difficult to suddenly break the pattern of antecedent factors that have molded your values and self perceptions for 20 years. I grew up relatively constricted by poverty, a tight leash from my parents due to their concern for me as their one and only child, bullying, psychological pressure of being keenly aware of the limit of your appeal and the limit of what you can feasibly offer anyone. For example, I would never bring a girlfriend to my house. It is far too small and basically is an oven from midday to midnight. I would never find an adequate place to take them anywhere because my parents would constantly be breathing down my neck for my safety. I couldn't spend much money on her in the form of gifts or trinkets. I wouldn't even be very interesting in general because the sorts of hobbies I adopted were the natural product of the limitations of my childhood (I have no experience doing unconventional fun things like surfing, going to the beach, fishing, playing laser tag or anything). I just don't have the background knowledge to suggest these activities. I don't foresee me being truly capable of these things until at least I have branched out significantly due to the necessities of my job or life direction. I just lagged behind everyone from the very beginning. It's a shame but I can't change my past.\"\n\nI want to know, does this sort of description of life events resonate with anyone? It isn't that I am asking if these particular factors are ones that you are familiar with but rather do you all agree generally that there is no simple immediate remedy for a consistent and unabating stream of antecedent circumstances that simply are not conducive to the sort of positive reinforcement necessary for developing such essential romantic skills as confidence, charisma, boldness, etc? That essentially in order to do well romantically you require positive experiences to validate your self perceptions but in the absence of those very experiences, there is no fix other than to merely stumble into positive experiences over time and gradually build up a portfolio of positive reinforcement.

Thinking about it makes my stomach hurt (I'm not kidding, it's very painful, it's like every muscle in my stomach tightens up and I get a little bit nauseous. I know that sounds dramatic but I swear it really does hurt). I've let myself go so much. I'm ashamed of how much I stopped caring. I speak softer and less confidently, I walk around less confidently, I'm afraid to talk to people (especially when I have to ask them for something), and I gained so much weight. I'm thankfully now finally starting to lose some. But it has shattered my confidence 150%. Even on my best day, I wasn't good enough for a piece of shit like her, so why would I be good enough for anybody else now? I guess she didn't do too much wrong other than lead me on a bunch of times, and I understand that the problem lies mostly with my reaction rather than her, but I wasted so much time on her. There were probably a bunch of other really nice and fun girls I could've had a chance with when I was (relative to now) thin and still the slightest bit of a pleasure to be around, but I was deadset on this girl who didn't give a shit. I've had a shot at a few girls since then. It has never ended well. I've gotten either stood up or ghosted by like 4 women in the space of two months earlier this year. That was so emotionally draining, because talking to girls and especially asking them out is so hard for me. Just two days ago, this really pretty and nice girl I work with (who I may have had a chance with, but we'll never know) was closing with me and I came so close to asking her out and I couldn't grow the balls to do it. Like I said, when you're not good enough for a piece of shit on your best day, why would you be good enough for a nice girl at your worst? The window on that one has also closed because she's moving two hours away for college in a few weeks and she has no more shifts scheduled. I knew that too. I told myself going in that that was a good thing because at least if she said no, I wouldn't have to see her again. But even knowing that it was my last chance, and that I had nothing at all to lose, I couldn't build up a shred of confidence to just ask this girl to get dinner with me. I couldn't even build up enough confidence to ask for her Snapchat. I know I wouldn't be like this if I wasn't constantly getting my heart broken. I know some of this shit I'm saying sounds really incel-y and believe me that disgusts me as much as it probably disgusts you, so any advice on how to actually build some confidence back up and forget this girl would be so nice.", "subreddit": "ForeverAlone"}

It made me reconsider my desire for emotional connection to another person. I have a really hard time connecting to people, so after finding one intense connection and having it go intensely wrong I don't have any conscious desire for something like that again. After being extremely sexually disappointed in every relationship since, that's not something I really care about either. At this point I'm just looking for a friend to cuddle with, not even really talk to because most of the burden of holding a conversation always falls on me. Relationships just feel bland and unfair, but physical touch is like a drug. I stayed in my last relationship a bit past the point where I stopped feeling anything for them, pretty much entirely for the sensation of physical touch, and I wasn't even the one to end that relationship. It honestly just felt like a set of motions I'd go through to be the ideal partner. I guess I liked the praise too. I don't usually get many compliments unless it's about food I've cooked or people calling me smart, but the former is fleeting and the latter makes me want to cringe so hard I stop existing right then and there.   \nI'm really jumpy and intensely ticklish and I'm really uncomfortable touching other people most of the time because it makes me feel like I'm creepy and they're uncomfortable, unless it's something hypernormal like a handshake or a high-five. I have one friend who really openly likes hugging people, so I always hug her when we greet. I hate that I feel so touch starved. Maybe I should get a dog, but I definitely do not have space.   \nSo here I am, continuing to swipe through online dating apps.

Too much in fact. The problem is however, I feel that people only value me for what they can gain from me, rather than valuing me intrinsically as a person.\n\nThe best example of this is that about three weeks ago I broke up with my girlfriend of over 2 years, because I felt completely alone in the relationship. Although I was the one to deliver the coup de grace, I feel as if she was the one who effectively ended the relationship through sheer neglect, both emotionally and sexually. For the last year of our relationship, and especially the final four or five months, she completely failed to listen, let alone act, when I cried out for her help. The loneliest I ever felt was when she said she wanted an open relationship to sleep with other people, despite the fact she was always \"too tired\", \"too depressed\", \"feeling sick\", or \"not in the mood\" if I wanted to have sex. I remember when I was trying to rekindle the relationship for the umpteenth time, I once asked her what she liked most about me. Her reply haunts me to this day, because she said she liked that I had an excellent reputation in our social/work circles, and she was always proud to introduce herself to other people as my girlfriend. At the time I thought this was sweet, but since our relationship deteriorated further, I came to realise how this was actually a colossal red flag. She never loved me for who I am, instead she simply appreciated the social status I gave her, and in our private life, she liked the fact I made her breakfast in bed every morning and supported her through her depression. Never did she value me as a human being, and if she ever felt physical attraction to me then it was fleeting, and soon evaporated. For the majority of the relationship, she only ever valued me as a means to her own ends. \n\nI feel like I have exactly the same problem in my work/public life. I should mention that we are both fairly successful political staffers in our country, with her having gained a lot of her success after becoming my girlfriend (partially, although of course not entirely due to my good reputation). Anyway, like I said, I am not your typical lonely person, as my phone never fucking stops ringing/buzzing, however the issue is that it's always somebody an agenda, hidden or otherwise. If you're one of the people on here who wished people reached out to contact you more, I can assure you it's a hollow victory when all people want is for you to agree to some ridiculous demand, vote for them in a ballot, or come to a pointless event you'd rather miss. At the end of a big week, I will have spoken to so many dozens of people, but I still feel so alone because no-one's genuinely in my corner. The one person who should have supported me, instead tried to convince me that she should be allowed to have sex with other people, after all the kind things I'd done for her during her many hours of need.\n\nTLDR; You can still feel incredibly lonely if your life is filled with people who only value you as a means to an end.", "subreddit": "lonely"}

Marked as NSFW for the last sentence of this and some of the imagery.\n\nListen the point of the post isn't to pity party myself. Nor is it to put anyone down.

Some examples:\n\n\u2022I often avoid my friends who invite me out.\u2022I feel like I don't have any friends, then proceeds to explain things that friends have said to them.\u2022I feel like I will never find anyone.\u2022Mundane and often destructive advice \"Go volunteer\"; \"Go to a bar\"; \"Get out of the house\".\n\nFirst off, I empathize with you and I feel for you. Trust me on this if there is one cliche thing I will say, you probably have it way, way better I did then a few years ago. So let me backtrack to 19 years old me.  I recently got dumped by my 18 yo GF. Why? Well, to be fair, the other guy was way better looking and had infinitely more of his shit together than me, albeit at 40 years old, but hey, love is love right? However, it devalued me immensely, especially when I found out that my boss at the fast food place I was working at also tried flirting with her. It felt like my time, space and existence was just straight not respected. I was also too young to know what I know now too. But after being catfished in one of the worst ways possible (sending me to a house they didn't even live at) and just months of literally no one talking to me. I decided that I was just going to straight stop caring. About everything, I mean literally everything. I overate, I barely bathed, I ignored literally everyone.\n\nSounds like heaven right? Sounds like the normal problems everyone has, right? Let me just say this is what a lot of people don't tell you. Eventually, the text messages stop, eventually people stop trying to initiate with you, eventually, people do in fact give up and don't want you around. I completely isolated myself after awhile. I had a few really close friends that I would go to their house and whatnot, but outside of that my weekends were primarily spent in my parents house in my room on my computer either jacking off to some chick on a website that would be completely unrealistic of me to even be with  taking from a dude built like an elephant trunk or playing video games. I even felt that it wouldn't matter if I had died. No one would ever suspect it be suicide. It would almost be a by-product of my lifestyle and no one would even care. I was so far in denial and depression.\n\nA lot of you think \"Man I haven't talked to anyone in months, what's wrong with me\", yeah? Well, try years my friend? Try living with a roommate that just didn't even notice you or care about you with only their hand out. Try having parents that literally stopped asking about grandchildren and friends in general. If you never have actually experienced people literally giving up in you, this is that path. There are a few things I have learned during this period in my life. 1) No one cares about your problems and everyone has their own. 2) No one is going to even if I fixed my problems.\n\nAt this point in my story, you might think this is where I met my beautiful SO and that it was all sunshine and rainbows and that I am here to tell you never to give up on what you want out of life. Well, no, you came to the wrong thread. This person doesn't exist and get them out of your head, it isn't going to happen. It will never happen if it hasn't happened yet. Self-improvement isn't about someone coming into your life and fixing it. It's you, realize that there are problems and you picking yourself up and you setting things right. It's you all you. Don't feel bad about this, ever. You need the strength to carry yourself and others. I know to some of you this has happened but you are part of an extremely low percent and are incredibly lucky and I am genuinely happy for you. But for the rest of us, magic girlfriend or boyfriend isn't going to come and save you from your depression. Its a horrifically unrealistic and unfair expectation you set for other people. What I did do was literally wake up one morning and just said \"my life sucks\". It did, the only time I ever got texts were about my bills. Emails? You mean coupons that were feeding my suicidal overeating tendencies? I did have work but even there people kept their distance from me.\n\nI am still in the process of trying to find my own happiness and yeah it would be nice if I had a GF. But now is not the time for that as it wouldn't be fair. I am just trying to take baby steps and learn how to be social again. Which sucks in your 30's. But I identified my issues, lost weight, looking for new work. When I play video games I make sure to play multiplayer games with a strong community. I have a clan in Destiny where we all communicate with one another. It's not impossible to dig yourself out of this grave. What I will tell you is that you can save yourself. What I will tell you is that you are not as abnormal as you may feel or broken as you may feel. You might just have to work for it harder than others. You might not even be aware of how lucky you are to have people in your life. You truly are, but I am not going to take those bad feelings away from you. If you are feeling them, then just acknowledge why and assess yourself a little. Find out why and most importantly seek help. If it wasn't for a psychologist and me opening my mouth to some of those I called friends I guarantee you I would be somewhere unknown either treating myself like a Christmas ornament or with a 9mm in my head. Don't underestimate the lives you actually have and really don't take your loved ones for granted! I made this mistake and I don't want to see anyone else travel down this road. Please don't take this as me attempting to further devalue you, take this as, damn, I really have it better than this guy. If this dip\\*\\*\\* can do better so can I.", "subreddit": "lonely"}

I even rehearsed some jokes or some standard questions and answers. \n\nSo, we were heading to the pub. Some guy rolls out a joint and take a hit. Not the first I\u2019ve smoked but it\u2019s been a few months. \n\nThen I after 5 minutes I start feeling the effects and I got a bit of anxiety. It was a cold night and started feeling really cold. \n\nI was chatting this and that with this guy, all cool.

There was a free seat there but two things: \n\n\\- was at corner besides a cute girl\n\n\\- was enclosed with the brick column so I would be just facing this cute girl \n\nI get nervous and another cute girl ask if I want to play pool which was besides the table (the place was a huge pool bar). And I say hell yes. \n\nThing is I played pool like 20 years ago in school. My ego enters here and wants to\nbe good. But I was very nervous and anxious. Two other guys join before we start the game and we team up. \n\nAfter a few turns I make a couple of good strikes. That makes feel good. Other people where watching around the pool table. Then ... I forgot what game we were and hit the 8 ball I to a pocket. I was like \u201cI\u2019m killing it\u201d but everybody look me blank. We loss. \n\nI felt so bad that didn\u2019t want to play again. So I just stood there around the pool table doing nothing for an hour. \n\nSome people came by and asked something which I replied with 1-2 words. I was close to some cute girls that I want to talk before and they were not talking anybody ... it was the perfect opportunity but my mind and body shutdown.\n\nFor fuck\u2019s sake, I couldn\u2019t do some basic human interaction. I was waiting for long to this opportunity and I screw it big time.\n\nThis was worst than being alone doing nothing surrounded by strangers, which I have done and learned to be comfortable. This was around people I knew for a while, greet them every time and maybe did some small talk with a few of them. \n\nEverybody was having a big time. I didn\u2019t knew who I could approach. Which talk group I could get close to. Which cute girl   I could approach. I just stood there like a psycho. Being highly self conscious and wanting to run away. \n\nIt was a fucking nightmare. I\u2019ve been around strangers and talked to them before with no problems whatsoever.

I never really wanted a girlfriend nor did I ever want to get married. Dating/marriage just never really appealed to me. I crave having friends. I've been FA since I graduated high school and that was in 2014. I had a strong group of friends and we were friends from elementary all the way to high school. After graduation we drifted apart since most of us went to different universities. We tried to stay in contact but it didn't work. Now a days I just spend my days waking up, going to work, coming home, watching Netflix, and finally going to sleep and then repeat. I tried to make friends with my coworkers but nothing works. I don't connect with any of my coworkers. All they talk about is their boyfriends/girlfriends, hookups, drama, celebrities, going to the club, the latest shitty song that came out, or talk about smoking weed. I try to pretend I'm interested but when I talk about the things I like they change the subject, they just nod their heads, or they end up avoiding me after the conversation. After a while I just gave up and now I'm a loner at work. I just want to find a group of friends that I connect with like the friends I had back in my school days. I'm so tired of going home after work and doing nothing and then waking up just to do the same thing. I want to go out and do stuff with people. I'm so bored and lonely. It's so hard making friends as an adult. It's easier when your a kid and a teenager because when you're a kid/teenager everyone is just worrying about having fun and doing wild and stupid stuff. It's not like that when you're an adult. People start becoming boring once they're adults. Once most people become adults they're focused on their careers, dating, and settling down and starting a family. I'm just so fucking lonely. I don't relate to anyone my age. The most frustrating thing is I love people but I just don't know how to connect with people and I'm so fucking socially awkward due to having autism. \n\nAnyone else struggle making friends as an adult?", "subreddit": "ForeverAlone"}

Let me tell you what I believe is causing my depression. I have posted here before and here is what I said:\n\n\u201cI feel as if I wasted the best years of my life doing something so dumb I can't stand life anymore. Last summer my group of friends started hanging out with this group of girls and one of them was interested in dating me. I decided not to date her because I was to busy with my business and saw that she was dating a new guy every month and I didn't just want to be just another guy. (BTW she was dating a lot for emotional reasons and not sex)\n\nWhen I was a kid I was very lonely and didn't have many friends. I was bullied for how I acted and how I looked. I was always pushed around in life and never had the confidence to do anything. When I got into high school I decided to take a stand to this bullshit and started building a business. I worked so hard to build my business and was so obsessed that when something wouldn't go right I would want to end my own life. Now at the end of my senior year my business makes about 60k a year in passive income and I will probably make 100k a year passively in the next couple of years. This would sound great to the old me and to many others but honestly I feel fucking stupid.\n\nSince freshman year I dreamed that senior year would be amazing. I would have a beautiful girlfriend and I could take her to homecoming and prom and have the kind of relationship I would see in the movies. My dream was so big but I felt my hard work could make something like this come true. Well honestly it did and thats what the problem is. The girl that I decided to pass up over the summer started dating a guy that she continued dating all school year up until today. Throughout the school year I had to watch them have the kind of senior year I have always wanted. Now that high school is over I feel like a huge failure. I chased money when I had the perfect girl in front of me the whole time who didn't care about my money or looks and liked me for me. Something much better than anything I could have dreamed of. Sadly I had to watch this die in front of my eyes. I can't believe how stupid I am. I wake up every morning in utter regret for what I have done. Each day gets worse as I think about what could have been to the point where I don't want to live anymore.\u201d\n\nI realized that my depression doesn\u2019t have much to do with her. It was the dream I had that I can now never fulfill. I can never take a girl I like to a dance with my friends and have a great time. I can\u2019t go to those games with a girl I care about. In fact I can\u2019t do anything now because it\u2019s over. I feel as if I never had the time I wanted to in high school and I feel as if I failed. I can\u2019t move on because I have this need to finish what I started and the fact that this dream is dead I feel as if I have died with it. It\u2019s all that mattered to me and now I have nothing besides 4 years of regret. To anyone who comments I know this may sound pointless to you but this was the dream I created and the dream I spent countless hours trying to achieve. All my struggles and successes are in that dream. Hopefully you can understand that if you worked as hard as I did and when you reached the moment when all your hard work was about to pay off you missed your chance and all you had to do was just was just say tell someone you like them and the dream would have been complete. I understand that yes she could have broken my heart but at least I would have got some kind of reward but instead I leave empty handed. The money that I earned means nothing without the dream. My chance to have a high school relationship is over and I am just done. Maybe I am crazy for being so depressed and suicidal for not completing what I wanted but please give your honest opinion.

Surrounded by a multitude of figures, a sun then, pale, bony, thin, weak, barely able to move their bodies from emaciation, the figures bow to the sun. The sun burns bright, casting light to all of the figures, a warming touch and lighthouse to those within its orbit, \u201cWhere did it come from?\u201d a few of the figures ask themselves. \u201cIt has always been there, and always will be,\u201d say the others, \u201cdo not concern yourself with such questions.\u201d \n\n  \n   All appears well for countless thousands of years, the sun caresses each and every one of the figures with its rays of warmth and guidance, until one day, at the very far reaches of the suns light a few of the figures find themselves cold and in darkness. \u201cWhat happened?\u201d, they cry, \u201cWhere is the light?\u201d   \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d those within the light's embrace reply, \u201cIt is where it has always been.\u201d   Cold, alone, and afraid, within the darkness they seek the light, blindly bumping into one another, and in their fear they strike out, attacking what monsters lie in wait in the darkness, never realizing that those they strike down are their former brethren in orbit of the sun. Millennia pass, the figures still bowing to the sun unaware of those left in the dark.   \n\n  \n  Many of those left in the dark despair for they wander and cannot find their way back, they follow the voices praising the sun and seek after them as starving men seek food, others, minds twisted by the darkness seek to find the sun and punish it for leaving them alone, they find familiar voices in the dark and whisper their poison to them, \u201cTake up arms,\u201d they hiss \u201cattack those in the light and bring them into the darkness, that we may show them the truth of existence.\u201d In this manner time marches on, and little by little the suns glorious rays of light shrink in size and in power unbeknownst to those blessed within its reaches. In the darkness the sickness and madness slowly spreads, some of those who choose despair ask the mad \u201cWhy do you rage against the dying of the light? It has left us now, we will not find our way home, lay down here with us, and accept your fate.\u201d\n\n   \n  The sun is less than half diminished now. \n\n  \n  A war breaks out among those seeking the light, the mad abusing the despaired in their rage, and the despaired rising to free themselves. The cries of the tortured and dying are enough for the warmed to take notice, benevolent as they think themselves, they attempt to lead those in the dark back to the light, but it is far too late for that now. The lives of those in the dark is so different from those in the light, and has been for so long, that what is common to the light is alien to the dark and what memories the dark has of the light are foreign and twisted. Angered by the hubris and reminded of the warmth they can no longer feel, the despaired and the mad join together to destroy what is left of the light and bring darkness to all. An even greater war begins. \n\n  \n  The sun shrinks more rapidly now as darkness, a will of its own, encroaches \n\n  \n  You sit, bowed toward the sun in the place you have always been, first among the figures before the sun. Word has spread of the war between the light and dark, but you fear not for the sun is where it has always been, and where it always will be. As the war rages on numbers on both sides dwindle until barely any of the figures are left, and on, and on, and on, until only 4 remain, you, the last warrior of the light, the last warrior of the dark, and the sun, no more than a speck now, illuminating and providing warmth to only the last two. You can feel the darkness approaching, its cold, and emptiness claws at your back. It has long been evident that the sun was dying but neither you nor the other figure were willing to admit that fact. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nYou bow toward the sun as the last champions of the dark and light meet in their final, mighty clash. Long ago the sun began to shrink, had the light attempted to bring those in the dark back into the fold, had even acknowledged that there was darkness, perhaps this outcome might not have come to pass. The battle is over, both champions lay dead, you are alone with only the barest of embers left in your hearth, the sun is but a grain of sand, twinkling in and out of existence, as you stare into what is left of the once mighty sun, fear wells up within you, a terror so gripping you think you might die, is this what those despaired  felt? Just as intense is the feeling of rage, at yourself, at the darkness, at the light, and at light's champion, were there anything left to hate you would hate it on principle. Finally there is acceptance, you will carry on in the dark, nothing is left to hurt you after all, you are the last of your kind.   \n\n  \n  The light goes out.\n\n You are cold, and in the darkness. \n\nAnd as terror grips your heart again you know you lied to yourself, there is no acceptance, only despair, now, and for eternity more, alone in the dark.", "subreddit": "ForeverAlone"}

I\u2019m pretty happy for a teenager but my parents moving me to around 14 different schools with my diagnosed Asperger\u2019s syndrome didn\u2019t help with my social life. Overall I did pretty well, gaining at least some friends in my current school which I\u2019ve been attending for nearly 3 years now (my current record). I\u2019m pretty well known in the school although I wouldn\u2019t see myself as popular. I\u2019m generally known for just attending loads of school activities like being prime minister of the school if you can believe that. I\u2019ve never really felt a deep bond with anyone since I naturally learnt it was better to stay away from relationships as to reduce emotional damage from my inevitable move to a different town or country even.\n\nAnyway...\nSo around December of this year I started to hang around these two girls, Kat and Laura (fake names). We always had a kind of mutual respect for each other as they had a similar \u201cnot give a fuck\u201d edgy humour but we only shared small jokes before that time, nothing worth being considered a conversation. We didn\u2019t really have many lessons together except literature class which when we had the chance Kat chose to sit next to me with Laura sitting on the table in front of us. I did initially have a thing for Kat but it was never my priority for having a friendship with her and Laura, which didn\u2019t really matter in the end since I shortly found out she had a boyfriend.\nKat and I would talk about just random stuff in class everyday, which made literature my favourite class even though I had been losing any and all attention for the class, unusual of me since I would normally be the \u201cteachers pet\u201d like the Eugene from Grease. Time goes by and it progressively gets better with Kat, making me love school again and just waiting for that class again. \nIt was like a friendly love even though weren\u2019t even that close, leaving our relationship to only that single class and us spotting each other down the hall.\nMy other guy friends were a bit anti social all being pretty immature, and I say that trying not to get bitch slapped onto the face of r/iamverysmart. I never really spent time with them outside of school because I felt it didn\u2019t and wouldn\u2019t give me anything of worth. Admittedly, I was a bit of an asshole to my friends throughout my story.\n\nAfter a while I invited Kat out for lunch via an overly long text, as friends obviously. I never really invited anyone to anything, never having any kind of celebration like a birthday party or something. This gave me no indication whether it was normal I do this and I was honestly just taking a gamble. The next day she sent me a text saying she was sorry she didn\u2019t see it but she couldn\u2019t see me most days because she was at work or with other friends. With my lack of proper judgement I thought I made a wrong move and stepped completely out of my boundaries. A few days later I sent a text that could be compared to an essay. I basically broke down and told her how I had never had a friend that I actually liked and all I wanted to do was spend time with someone, anyone. It was an incredibly dickhole move of me to do that but I was on the verge of emotional collapse and it was just unfortunate that Kat was the one dealing with it. She responded saying she was sorry again for not being able to do stuff outside of school and that she was terrible when it comes to emotional advice and stuff like that. \n\nIt remained weird for around a week but soon recovered and was like nothing had happened. Later on I asked Laura out for lunch in a much shorter more socially acceptable way. She actually agreed and we set a date on the same week. I could not begin to describe how exhilarating this felt. For the first time in ever I would get to talk with someone about something other than horse shit. I wanted and needed this and it calmed me down knowing that lunch wasn\u2019t such an out of reach proposal after all. I had taken my best outfit and left them clean for the following days and took out my dusty aftershave which my dad got me ages ago and I never wore because I would never have any special occasion. On the day Laura said she had to cancel and move to the next day which I handled pretty well. The next day I texted her asking where we should meet.\nNo response\nAn hour and a half later I text again asking if lunch is still okay.\nAnother two and a half hours go by and I\u2019m still waiting by the door in my outfit.\nIt\u2019s 4:00pm\nStill no response.\nAt this point I might as well have dinner. When we get back to school she says nothing, nothing to indicate anything out of the ordinary. To be fair, I never asked out of shame. I overhear her speaking to Kat about how her phone went all glitchy or something like that. I text her later down the week asking if this was still her number. She replied later saying how she was sorry that she didn\u2019t come and explaining that her phone broke. I say it\u2019s \u201cno problem\u201d (bull shit btw). I had been let down so many times and this was what I thought would be my redemption, my \u201crescue\u201d from loneliness as a 16th century writer would put it. I wasn\u2019t angry with Kat or Laura because I don\u2019t expect much from people and someone doing something like this would be typical. I thought it was normal. Months go by and we\u2019re still friends at school, much better actually, Kat starts to become more comfortable and affectionate which is what I would want in a friend, not someone held down by there own insecurities. I decide again that I shouldn\u2019t have to keep our friendship constrained to one hour in class. So I decided to invite her to lunch again, she\u2019s in another town, again, she\u2019s going away with her boyfriend, again, again, again. I do the same with Laura and ask her out to lunch. Doesn\u2019t respond. Again. Doesn\u2019t respond. I ask once every month to see if I can get some kind of progress.\nNothing.\n\nThis really hurt me as overdramatised as that sounds. I\u2019ve never had a true friend before and I hoped this was my one way ticket out of my shitty friend group.\n\nI know I sound like a super emo edgy teen  like one of those people who cut themselves for attention or something, but in late June I had planned to drown myself in a nearby lake. I was standing on the side of the lake when I had one last ditch effort. I called Laura.\nIt went straight to voicemail. I tried again and nothing.\nI thought if I was meant to be alive then maybe I would get that lunch or maybe just be able to talk with my friend on the phone. Thank bajeebus because someone shitty kids set a line of dry hay on fire which I went over with a few other people nearby to move the hay so it wouldn\u2019t spread. The fire brigade go there around 20 minutes after the fire was actually out. We joked about how poorly our government was funded and that got me to raise at least a portion of my spirits. In the end, my life wasn\u2019t saved by some grand ending of me getting that lunch but just me having some banter with a few strangers about our shitty country.\nI know nothing that happened or didn\u2019t happen wasn\u2019t the fault of Kat or Laura and that it was just incredibly bad timing but I just wanted someone to rely on. I just wanted an actual friend. But I couldn\u2019t help but feel angry at anything, whether it be Laura and Kat or myself for being so immature just anything. \nI know this is kind of an AITA post but I just want to know if I\u2019m the insane bad guy in all of this", "subreddit": "lonely"}

I made what I thought were good friends, when in reality, they were all pretty toxic. \n\nThey didn't really care about me or how I felt; they just saw me as a free therapist to vent to, or a scapegoat for their problems. For example, one friend blamed me for her depression because I didn't try hard enough to fix it for her.\n\nIn hindsight, I can see how screwed up my friendships, but at the time, I felt like I deserved to be treated like crap (a decade of abuse will do that to you lololol). Eventually, as I pursued therapy and my state of mind improved, I realised that I deserved better than the way my friends were treating me. I cut them out of my life, and I don't regret it.\n\nFrom time to time, though, I get hit with waves of loneliness. I do have friends, but they all live pretty far away (I had to move for work and I haven't really made friends in my new city yet). I still have a couple of the less toxic people from the group on Facebook, and sometimes, I see photos of all of my old friends hanging out. My rational brain tells me that I'm not missing out because they all treated me like crap anyway.

Now I am a lower middle class guy in a college full of rich folks in the same country. \n\nUpto 10th grade, I was in one school, I had a lot of friends, and while I was introverted, I was really close with a big tight nit circle of friends (both girls and guys). I changed my school after 10th grade and made the biggest mistake of my life: became a recluse. I don't know why I did it, but I started deserting my decade old friends. I was moving to a more affluent school and I guess my 14 year old self thought that I would start a new and better life and leave the introverted self behind. That failed. I had a new group of close friends now, although much smaller. Still, life was good. \n\nAfter that I joined a good college, and the worst chapter of my life began. I stay in a men only dorm. I don't go to classes because I prefer learning from the internet. I have never been an outgoing person. So I don't have any friends outside my dorm. All men. These \"friends\" only care about getting girls, which I don't really care about. I honestly wouldn't have any problem with being a recluse, but the \"friends\" that I know ridicule and look down upon me for having \"no life\", especially for having no female friends. I am fed up of this shit. Of course I'd like to have a few close friends and a girlfriend to share my feelings with. But I am too introverted to chase after girls like these other guys in college do. This constant ridicule for having no life is taking a toll on me. A part of me wants to just study good and have a great career ahead of me, but I know that I am not special. I start every day happily, but I am brought down by these fucks. \n\nI know that this post is not coherent at all.

My father deliberately isolated himself away from his extended family, he essentially cut himself off from them to the point where to me they seemed like strangers and i'd end up getting a huge amount of social anxiety being around them. I never felt like I could act normal around them because it felt like such an abnormal event... I remember my mother telling me how I always needed to be on my best behaviour around her parents which sort of stifled my personality as I learned I couldn't just relax and be myself around them. I think I learned that extended family was this unusual situation that should fill me with dread. I don't think I've ever felt myself around extended family and I've learned to be just as nervous (perhaps even more so around them), even though it's rare I feel truly relaxed around anyone I get more anxiety visiting extended family than I do with friends.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNot only were we detached from family ties but social ones too. Mother and father didn't really have any friends, and if they did they played no part in our family! My fathers only real friend was perceived as a reprobate that my father had to hide his friendship with. And as far as I can tell, my mother never made friends, not only that but my mother and father never tried to find friends for us. They simply moderated the friends we found ourselves.. So if I made friends with someone my mother didn't like she would step in and ban me from hanging out with them but she would make no effort in trying to find a friend for me. There was no type of matching. play dates is a term or idea I had never knew existed until I got on the internet!!! It simply was a concept I had never heard of or knew it was a thing!\n\nIt was all up to me and my sister to find our own friends. I ended up choosing bad friends who at worst bullied me and at best were apathetic about my company. I never learned how to recognise a good friend! and because of low self esteem I defaulted to bad friends.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nthe influence of my parents\n\nwhen my parents divorced my father continued to neglect all chores around the house, turned up to work late every day, spent all his free time hanging out with his friend my mother despised and got drunk so I basically learned that I should do this when hanging out with friends. This started at school when I would get high and drunk with friends, then when I left school I used to get drunk in my spare time and with any money I had with a person who encouraged drinking to the point of inebriation or alcohol poisoning,this person would sometimes become abusive towards me. My father never looked for another wife or girlfriend, so I learned to do the same thing, I also learned to be totally apathetic about taking care of myself and not giving a shit about work. I lived with him from my mid teens until mid 30s and during this time my behaviour pretty much mimicked his. In fact it was probably worse because by this time anxiety and mental health issues was really crippling me to the point where I became a shut in who had to live off my father or the state.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo not only I was not given the tools or support to socialise or choose good friends. But I endured emotional neglect from my mother and a form of bullying from my father. \n\nMother essentially wanted a child that had achieved something, a child she could feel proud of, she would argue with my father because of his lack of achievement or his willingness to want to self improve and would nag him about his neglect of the house. Whenever id attempt to want to achieve something or do something my mother could be proud of me for ,or even express interest in very masculine things my father would undermine it or belittle me as this would then highlight and make him consciously aware of his own ineptitude in this area. He'd do this in incredibly subtle ways that were undetectable to outsiders but were done to have maximum impact on me on a subconscious level, this sort of insidious chipping away at my self esteem. So I never really won my mother's affection and I simply followed by fathers negative behaviour. I never really learned positive masculine traits and felt like I was forced or encouraged to simply express feminine ones.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nbeing bullied and unable to stick up for myself\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI had to keep emotions to myself because if I told them to my father he would manipulate me and use it against me and telling my mother would do no good because she would never listen or cared. I kept everything to myself and I feel this is where I possibly developed a schism in my personality. I never knew what acceptance and unconditional love was because I never experienced it, I had this eroded sense of self esteem before I even started school which the bullies at school honed in on and targeted me for. I was easy prey for them. The \"friends\" I had at school metaphorically stabbed me in the back and abused me ,sometimes sexually. I have a lot of difficulty now forming any relationships with people. As an adult I face the challenge of needing emotional support and love from a woman in a dating world where this is not expected of the woman to provide that role.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI have had small glimpses into what a life would be like where I felt loved ,respected and supported through the very small amount of relationship experience I've had. of course I deluded myself into thinking the women in question would provide that through as I was under a heavy dose of love or lust and every time I would reveal my sensitivity ,needs and vulnerabilities to the women I had fallen for they became absent from me. This is the prevailing pattern and lesson I've learned through my dating life, any potential is squandered immediately once they realise how needy and insecure I am. It's like an instant kill to the relationship between me and them.\n\nFtr I am about 40 years old ,unemployed with mental health issues that cripple me to the point of feeling disabled. I'm pessimistic in my outlook on ever finding a person who will help me blossom into a normal human being and the reality of being alone is making me feel suicidal. I face insurmountable odds and feelings of worthlessness to the point where I have zero confidence in approaching women and any woman who I feel takes a real interest in me becomes someone I develop infatuation for as I am so desperate. I feel like I've been consciously aware of this but unable to do anything about it. Part of me just feels incredibly resentful that I am expected to somehow fix myself when I'm ill equipped and born ignorant into how to do so.

So yeah I really do feel like my constant loneliness stems from emotional neglect and being an outcast in my family. \n\nWhat are yalls stories and what do you do when you feel really lonely?", "subreddit": "lonely"}

I'll try to just cut the bs and keep it as short as I can.\n\nIs anyone else single, craving an actual relationship with someone, but holding themselves back because they're afraid they're not ready or not good enough?\n\nThat's basically the story of my life right now. I'm a 22 year old female and I have never had an actual relationship. I was in an online situationship when I was a teenager. It lasted a couple years and that's the closest I've ever come to love.\n\nI struggle socially, I can't even make friends. I try to make friends online but either don't connect well with others or just eventually lose contact because the other person grows apart and falls into their own life. Which is completely understandable, it just leaves me feeling sad and alone. Its hard to really connect with people and keep that connection. It just falters over time and it's so sad to feel it crumbling.\n\nAnyways, I'm at that point where a part of feels ready for something serious. I want it. But a big part of me screams no. My mind convinces me that I'll never be \"normal\" enough or good enough for that. I see so many people my age who are in love and it makes me feel so sad. I get depressed over it sometimes and will cry myself to sleep.\n\nI can't even look people in the eyes. I can't start conversations, can't ever really partake in them. I just don't feel comfortable socially. Its holding me back from work as well. I've been putting in applications but the ones I actually want don't come through. I've gotten one call back - McDonald's - but didn't bother responding because the time I put down for work clashes with my transportation. Which is another issue, I don't drive yet.\n\nI go to school and will thankfully be starting the fall semester soon. That's literally all I've got. I know, I need to work on becoming independent and going to school is the first step for me. I waited years to be able to go and now that I am, it's great. But it's not exactly what I thought it would be. I've been sheltered my whole life and now that I'm an adult, I feel like I'm drowning. I know I need to just jump in but damn, it's hard and it's scary.\n\nI hear different things when it comes to love. \"Just put yourself out there, they'll love you exactly as you are.\" \"Build yourself up first, put the best version of you out there.\" \"If you wait until you're ready, you'll always be waiting.\" \"Just wait, the right guy will chase you and show you he really cares.\" Blah. Blah. Blah.\n\nI'm lonely. Extremely lonely. But I also just don't feel good enough to try. Its gotten to the point I don't even want to try to just make friends anymore. I'm always left out and left behind. I'd rather just be lost in that loneliness at times than to risk getting hurt again and again. Same old song and dance.\n\nAnyone else relate? Anyone got any tips to cope or any advice? Its obviously something I'd have to work on myself but I feel so overwhelmed with life and don't even know where to begin. Its not that I don't want to - I just don't know how. There's times I stop and think about it and literally feel this heaviness and it's hard to breath. I wouldn't call it a panic attack, just this overwhelming rush of uncertantity. Nothing I can't handle or get through, thankfully. I just wish sometimes there was someone who genuinely cared and was there for me, not to hurt or use me. Which unfortunately, has happened several times over. I just wanna give up sometimes and live in the woods away from everyone lol", "subreddit": "lonely"}

It was so embarrassing. My mom ordered 6 pizzas expecting a crowd and it was just us. My one friend who i used to text about everything maybe responds to me once a day now. My other friend lives in another country and my third friend isn\u2019t close with me anymore.

Im surronded by relationships and I see all the ups and downs of them but I still hadn't have anyone truly just love me, romantically and sexually.

{"post_id": "coyl0y", "created_utc": 1565539784, "title": "Heartbroken", "author": "carrieesson", "self_text": "Just need to vent out. Ive just had my heart broken and I physically and mentally can\u2019t handle it. \n\nI\u2019ve had three failed relationships that were toxic and unhealthy so I managed to heal from them pretty quickly, mostly because they didn\u2019t treat me correctly so my sadness turned in to anger and it helped my healing process. I\u2019ve always wanted out of the relationships because I haven\u2019t been happy, so it\u2019s been easier for me to heal. \n\nAfter coming out a bad relationship I actually started to feel so much happier and more confident within myself. I was going to the gym, eating healthy, spending time with friends, doing things on my own and enjoying my own company. I felt so confident within myself because there was no one in my life bringing me down. No drama or arguments. \n\nI decided to go on a few dates but never saw them again cause there was no connection. Then I met a guy and I just clicked instantly with him. We started to spent time together, going for long walks on the beach, going to the cinema, we spoke every day, the sex was so intimate and emotional, I genuinely thought he was amazing.\n\nHe was the sweetest any man had ever been towards me. Kind, caring, cute. He told me he was falling in love with me, that he was excited about our future, that I was amazing, perfect, that he was lucky to be dating me. We agreed not to see anyone else and he told me he wanted a relationship with me in the future but we agreed to take it slowly. We booked tickets for events that are in October. We told our family and friends about each other. For the first time in years, a man actually made me have butterflies, was giving me hope, and I just really enjoyed being with him and talking to him. I felt so happy.\n\nThen last week things started to change through messenger and he was acting distant. He told me he was depressed because his gran is dying, even though he hasn\u2019t spoken to her in over 10 years his dad was upset so it was an unhappy household. He was due to start working for a company but they were messing him around and taking ages getting documents etc all set up for him to start working, so he was broke and depressed because he had no money and wasn\u2019t in a proper daily routine. He was being open about his emotions which I thought was a positive thing. I\u2019m also going through some physical health problems at the moment so it seemed like we were both helping each other through a tough time. \n\nBut he just kept acting more and more withdrawn. We agreed to see each other on Tuesday and I would try my best to cheer him up, and I\u2019ve really been looking forward to it. But this morning I received a message from him saying he doesn\u2019t think he\u2019s in the mental state to progress with anyone in a romantic relationship, I am absolutely heartbroken and devastated and can\u2019t stop crying.\n\nThis hurts more than the ending of previous relationships, because he\u2019s not actually treated me badly and now I\u2019m mourning the fantasy of what could have been.\n\nI don\u2019t understand it, how can someone say they\u2019re falling in love with me and be excited about our future, and the next minute say he\u2019s not in the right place for a relationship? \n\nI\u2019ve told him I\u2019m willing to take it slowly, to help him through whatever he\u2019s going through, and asked him not to push a good thing away just because he\u2019s having a few tough weeks mental health wise.\n\nI just feel so confused, hurt, devastated and rejected. I opened up my heart to him, showed him my vulnerability and he\u2019s crushed me. I don\u2019t know if he\u2019s making up excuses about his mental health or if he actually was just lying and doesn\u2019t have feelings for me at all.\n\nIf we both have feelings for each other I don\u2019t get why it has to be complicated. All I want to do is see him and hold him and beg him to give us a chance, but I have to keep my self respect. \n\nI can\u2019t eat and all I want to do is lay in my bed and cry. Why does no one want me or appreciate me? Why cant someone just love me? I have so much to offer, and no one appreciates it. I feel so empty and lonely \u2639\ufe0f and like an absolute fool for falling for someone. I wish my heart wasn\u2019t so fragile and sensitive \ud83e\udd7a", "subreddit": "lonely"}

If it\u2019s not love at first sight, it\u2019s love that comes through means that just don\u2019t work in real life. The \u201cthey both hate each other, and annoy each other, and eventually fall in love\u201d trope is almost entirely fictional. In real life if two people argue all the time, and hate each other\u2019s guts and then end up sleeping together, I promise you they talk, text and flirt behind the scenes all the time before they ever hop in the sack. They never just all of a sudden kiss in the middle of an argument.\n\nThe same goes for the \u201cthe underdog nice guy gets the girl in the end trope\u201d. It sincerely doesn\u2019t happen, but it\u2019s such a common trope that if you grow up with it from a young age you can confuse it for reality. In reality being nice is always important but it\u2019s not what makes a person attracted to someone. That\u2019s a combination of things from confidence, skills, looks, charisma, having interesting hobbies, not being afraid to show interest, etc.\n\nI think this is where a lot of the problems I\u2019ve seen in this sub come from. I\u2019ll disclose that I\u2019m not FA, but when I was young (12-14) I 100% believed in the \u201cnice guy\u201d trope and struck out pretty much all the time with maybe one small exception, then one summer when I was 17 I went to visit my family in a different country and decided to just screw around and just be myself and chat up/ask out every attractive girl my age I saw when I was out with my cousins. I went on 2 dates that summer, (one with a girl that I ended up having talking to on and off for years and eventually taking a romantic vacation to Germany and Spain with 5 years later)  and I also got the numbers of two more girls who I would end up talking to for months to come, and one who coincidentally happened to also be American and ended up living near my city who I ended up losing my virginity to at 19. And the success continued with women once I got home.\n\nI say all of this because that one summer 8 years ago was like me opening my eyes for the first time and the change in perspective that I came back with really really stuck with me. Characters in movies and the relationships they have are usually meant to simply express parts of the human experience, but they\u2019re not a guidebook on how to enact those experiences. Until you get to know someone on a romantic level then expressing feelings of romantic love for them is usually jarring and uncomfortable because in their heads it\u2019s a platonic relationship.", "subreddit": "ForeverAlone"}

(saying yes before thinking seems to be quite a good method, at least to some extent...). Yesterday me and 3 of my high school friends went clubbing. I didn't know how it would go but I wanted to try and not think much about it. Before we got there I was fine. After we got there I was fine. But I don't know. I immediately started feeling like it's not for me. Exhaustingly loud music. People everywhere. I can't dance, didn't want to, couldn't get myself to try, I couldn't imagine it being fun. Even while being drunk I couldn't do it. Ended up sitting for the whole time. Alone, sourrounded by everyone having fun. I don't remember ever feeling as alone as there. It was some of the worst hours recently. We finally decided to move on. There are pubs everywhere on the street. As we go by one of them there's 2 employees standing next to the entrance. One of them says to us \"wanna get in for a beer\" and the second one goes \"don't you see his friend isn't even 17\" like wtf. Do I need to be constantly reminded that I look like an ugly kid? When I got back home I jumped into my bed, hugged a fucking curled up blanket and cried myself to sleep harder than anytime recently. Nothing makes me happy. I don't know what to do. The more I try the worse it is. Nothing good ever happens. I still can barely make a hair appointment. I'm failing uni. I can't even begin to look for a job even though I have more than enough qualifications to find a good one. Everything scares me. I just dream about a true, peaceful, close friendship. One in which we could be honest about our thoughts and feelings. I want to have someone I can hug. It's all I really want. But I can't imagine opening up more to a man. I've never had a female friend. Never been close to having one. A year ago I was so down I actually tried to talk to one I've known like 9 years ago. She was the closest to me. We never even talked before. And she was the closest. That's how pathetic I am. I don't know. Am I fated to be sad? Maybe I don't know how it's like not to be? Maybe I want to be sad?

But along that I was bombarded with questions and skepticism why was I FA, how can I be FA cause I am Indian woman and oh you have option of arrange marriage or you have high standards and my comments that in no way were negative or rude were downvoted. Further proving the point that as female FA our existence in this sub or in general is that we are either arrogant, entitled, manic or severely ugly for human feelings. I wouldn\u2019t take this to heart but since people here said that someone like me can\u2019t exist, here I am sharing my life story here why I exist and am sure many like me do! \nGrowing up in India as a tomboy was severely awful experience, constantly being bullied and taunted by people as it\u2019s very much against the norm which gave me social anxiety and I ended up being shy and nervous around people. It didn\u2019t help that my parents were controlling, very demanding and wanted us to never have a social life and were and still are very overprotective and dominating. The only friend I had in high school also passed away at 16,which was a great loss to me and I became very closed up; I thought things were going to improve in college but it didn\u2019t even though I did started working on my looks, social skills etc but it was too late. Working in place where I am younger than almost everyone by a decade and which is mostly dominated by women didn\u2019t help my situation at all. I don\u2019t have friends to hang out with, my social life is non-existent and even though I tried Meetup groups it got me no success. As far being Indian and arrange marriage thing is concerned my family did tried to show me to potential suitors who were almost all older than a decade than me(pretty common in arrange marriage cases), had absolutely nothing in common with me, the first question their parents asked me was can I cook and clean and how many dishes can I prepare, but they wanted and made it clear that I am expected to live as a housewife, have no job or career and certainly be living with the groom, his parents and siblings and taking care of all of them domestically. I have been micromanage by my parents all my life until now last thing I want is this cycle to be continued by my in-laws and would end up meaning nothing to a man other than being a maid by the day and blow up doll by the night. I am a human regardless of my gender or my race I deserve to be respected as a human to be important to someone, I don\u2019t mind cooking or cleaning for someone just not for someone who doesn\u2019t care for me. If that is wrong of me to do well I am guilty and proud. I may be a 25 yr old KHV and I know beggers can\u2019t be choosers but that doesn\u2019t mean I will let people treat me like a doormat.

My work isn't all that rewarding, but it can be. Occasionally I get to mentor people and they move on to great careers and that has been something I'm rather proud of. \n\nI should be fine. \n\nI'm not fine. I feel silly for not feeling fine. \n\nToday my cousin-in-law said no thanks to us meeting up for a football game in Chicago. I happen to be a bit of a Broncos fan, having lived in the Denver Metro area for 12 years. Living in Cincinnati now, I miss going to ball games and the Bengals just aren't doing it for me. My cousin-in-law enjoys football games of all types and my wife said that he was feeling a bit out of sorts with his life at the moment. But he said no. So oh well. \n\nFor whatever reason, I got this sinking feeling in the pit my stomach when he said \"no\". Its the same area I felt activity whenever I'd ask a girl on a date and she said no, or for the entirety of the 6 months between my first wife asking for a divorce and finally being granted said divorce.

I'm really not sure why meeting people, mainly strangers, is so hard. Have people become so reclusive to meeting new people that forming connections is impossible? I get the stranger, danger aspect as you really cant tell about people anymore, but it feels like if you dont have a mutual friend to introduce you to others then you are marked as a social outcast. I think I'm a decent looking guy, \" https://imgur.com/wrcclDX \" or so I have been told by many of my friends. Granted my gay friends give me the most attention, but I'm not gay or bi. Sometimes it seems like it would be easier if I were but I'm just way too much into women. I'm still in my prime dating age of mid 30's. I've been a single father to my children for the last 10 years. I'm not looking for someone to be a mother figure to my kids, or even help out. I have a respectful job and am able to support our lifestyles. I guess I'm just tired of not having a connection with someone. I miss meaningful conversation, disagreements, flirting, banter, the closeness you get from just having someone to call your own. I am a lil bitter from how my past relationships have happened, but to me it was a great insight. It allowed me to grow, to realize my shortcomings, and what I am not looking for in someone. I have tried dating sites but they seem like a scam. Too many fake profiles, too impersonal, everyone seems like they are gods gift to a perfect match, and yet I cant match with anyone. I ask myself, \"Am I really that boring?\" I have similar traits and interests as some of these people yet I get ghosted after a few responses or no response at all. I get that women probably get bombarded with replies from guys and it can be overwhelming, but in my honest attempt to just strike up a convo, no strings or expectations, I get ignored. It's a little disheartening to be told by friends that you are a \"catch\" a lil misunderstood, but anyone would be lucky to land you, and you cant even get the chance to take someone out on a date to get to know them. It feels like I'm defective.\n\nI know someone is going to tell me to try social things like the park, a local meetup, or get a dog. I'm not a big dog person, I prefer cats, and most social things dont interest me much, like going to the bar, which I do.....sometimes, but its never a good place to meet someone, unless its a social event with friends. I also happen to live in a state where meeting singles is the hardest in the US. There also isnt much in the form of social gatherings where I live, unless I was still in my college age, and I'm probably too old for that crowd. Most decent women I do meet, the ones who catch my attention, that I could \"take home to mom\" so to speak, are always taken or not interested in dating. The old friends I have dont want to ruin our friendship. So where does one look when trying to find \"that one\"???", "subreddit": "ForeverAlone"}

Yes, being alone is well, lonely and painful. But it's not without its lessons learned and lessons *being* learned.\n\nAs a person who's mostly (if not always) on my own, I've learned to be resourceful. I learned to be independent. I learned that mistakes in decision-making that cause inconvenience in my everyday-living (like being short on food budget or transpo money) is on me. Which prompts on my being resourceful. If I'm buying 2nd hand goods for my living needs, I learned to be vigilant. I guess you could consider this as people/negotiation skills. I learned to clean and to cook (this is one is fun) to feed myself and keep the place tidy, ultimately living in a hygenic and healthy household.\n\nBut here's my favorite lesson that I've learned: I learned to let my loneliness **elevate** me to a more **well-rounded person**. I learned new skills, I picked up new hobbies and just began to learn, learn, learn. Nasty tear on my favorite shirt? I can **fix** my own clothes. Am I hungry? Let me **cook** myself up a nice meal. I have this obsession just learning something new everytime so that heavy thoughts of my own loneliness aren't occupying my head all the time. It makes thing ***a lot*** more managable.And your setting yourself up to be a living swiss-knife.\n\nOther lessons I need to learn though, is to know when to ask help. There's a fine line between being a dependent person, and an independent person who knows how to ask for help when needed. I need to learn how to trust too. My loneliness/being a loner is a result of trusting too much, the wrong people and not wanting it to happen for the upteenth time which leads to why I choose to be alone.\n\nSo what about you guys? Has being lonely ever teach you something to make you a better person?", "subreddit": "lonely"}

I am a really really quiet person and she was really my only friend.

{"post_id": "cpw7nz", "created_utc": 1565716639, "title": "At what age is it weird?", "author": "al95eng", "self_text": "I've noticed some debate on this sub recently regarding at what stage in one's life it becomes strange to have never dated, etc. I thought I'd offer my opinion on this, for what it's worth. I've put a lot of thought into this lately. I'm 23 M, and a KHHV. I've been on a handful of dates recently. That's the extent of my romantic experience. Up until about a year ago, maybe less, I didn't really care. I had the attitude of \"who really needs this anyway\". It turns out I was just repressing my feelings of wanting to be with someone, and I always felt awkward speaking to anyone on the subject of romance. To begin dating felt like trying to scale an infinitely-high wall. I decided to change all this. I think the desire finally became strong enough for me to try and do something about it. \n\nI'm no psychologist, but I understand the brain still goes through rapid and significant development during one's late teens and early twenties, so a lot of people start to mature and want a real relationship during their mid-20s, it seems. This is why college/uni is so important for social development, something which I scoffed at when I first started. I was only there for the education, and I regret that now. I went from not caring at all, to these thoughts sort of consuming me. Next to my career, this seems like the most important thing in my life right now. I am getting this intense desire to be with someone. I fantasise about even the most basic forms of intimacy, like hugging, which is something that I've never experienced. I think some of this might have been triggered by the movie Before Sunrise, which I stumbled upon recently. I've become fascinated with it, which is kind of embarrassing for me to admit as a guy, but whatever.\n\nSome of my family seemed curious about my situation when I went to uni, but I just brushed it off. Like I mentioned before, I was embarrassed and felt awkward even talking about this. Recently, I overcame this hurdle, and I no longer feel embarrassed about going on dates, it just seems natural now.\n\nSo, with all this in mind, I'd say that around 20 is when it starts to get a little awkward, if you have no romantic experience whatsoever. Despite what people think, not everybody dates in high school, from my experience at least. Probably less than half in fact. Afterwards, a lot of people really start to expand their social circle, meet people, date, etc. I'd say I was in a slight majority when I graduated high school, now I'm in a small minority. I'd say &gt;95% of my friends have dated extensively or been in relationships by now. So, it becomes worrying by 25, I'd say. In my culture, a lot of people get married around this age, so maybe that has something to do with it. In a nutshell: things rapidly go downhill between 20-25.", "subreddit": "ForeverAlone"}

But, once I tell my familyI am gay I won\u2019t matter to them anyway. I\u2019ve only told my only friend, who is distant &amp; straight, that I am gay and regret doing that everyday.

After carefully weighing up all the options, I have decided to stop pursuing any sort of romantic relationship. I have decided this for a couple of reasons, such as:\n\n1. Any relationship that I could potentially have would not reach any expectations that I have about such things. This isn't anyone's fault but I believe that any such relationship would not make me happy and would just lead to me becoming more stressed. I admit to having a tendency to put others ahead of myself, especially if I care about their well being and I feel like such a situation would just lead to a decline in both my physical and mental health  \n\n1. I struggle to find people that I actually enjoy spending time with and that enjoy the same things that I do. I get the concept of experiencing new things with new people but I will admit that I don't have the drive or ambition to do either of those things. Some may see me as a boring person for this but that's just what I'm like; If i like something, I'll do it but I'm not very open to new experiences. \n\n1. I struggle to find people attractive. I don't know whether its something wrong with me or something but I find it hard to be even slightly attracted to people. I can enjoy parts of their personality or some of the way that they act, but I have yet to find anyone that I have liked in such a way. I think that I may be [Autochorissexual](https://asexuals.fandom.com/wiki/Autochorissexual), since many of Its associated tendencies(?) relate to how I feel about myself.\n\n1. I'm tired of being rejected and not being wanted by others. I know that my post history may say otherwise but it is common for me to be rejected and mocked by others for everything I do or have done. I'm sick of repeating the process of trying to get close to people and sacrificing things that I've worked for just to be let down, told I'm not worth it or just ignored. I've been called ugly and every other name and insult under the sun (my favourite being \"If I was as ugly as you, I would have killed myself years ago\"). I've had enough of it because I simply don't care anymore.\n\nI want to thank everyone here for helping me in more ways than you can imagine. Having a community of people experiencing the same emotions and situations that I have has really helped me in the past couple of months and I look forward to spending more time helping others in this subreddit, just like others have helped me.\n\nI really want to hear what people have to say and I'd be happy to answer any questions that people have, Its the least I could do.\n\nThanks for reading.", "subreddit": "ForeverAlone"}

So here it goes.", "author": "Texasgirl18", "self_text": "There should be a way for humans to shut off their minds. Stop thoughts from taking over. Even if just for a moment. Or a way to stop feelings. This past two months have been a torment. All I\u2019ve done is just think and think and think some more about how I ruined what little happiness I had found. How I ruined the one friendship that helped me overcome all the other shit in my life. Now that I have nothing, its just constant pain. Constant thoughts. Negative thoughts. They don\u2019t go away. I don\u2019t get a break. From dusk till dawn and all the other hours in between the two. Its an actual nightmare. Its overwhelming. All I want is peace. All I want is to have him back. But nothing ever happens. Nothing changes. Its just me and these awful thoughts and feelings. When he first left, I was so depressed all I could think about was suicide. All I wanted was to not live anymore. Granted I have managed to suppress those thoughts. I\u2019ve moved from Suicidal to severely depressed. A slight improvement but still not good enough. Suicide is still in my thoughts. Lurking. But its being held back by what little hope I have left. Hope that he\u2019ll change his mind. Hope that he misses me too. Misguided hope. I just miss him. No one did anything for me like he did. And what he did do might sound stupid or miniscule to other people but for me it was a life changer. He literally changed my life. Both for the best and the worst. I had spent such a long time acclimating to loneliness. I had not had an actual \u201cfriend\u201d since I left high school. And after that long period of loneliness I had grown so accustomed to it, I honestly didn\u2019t feel it anymore. And then he showed up. And that careful mask I had glued on started to unstick. And I began to want his company. I wanted a friend. Not just a friend but a best friend. He listened to me. Not just pretended but listened to what I said. He remembered things about me. It seemed like he cared. He opened my eyes to music I had never even thought off. He gave me the attention I craved so much. And slowly I began to depend on him. For laughter. For fun. For everything. He made me feel like I was a person worthwhile. Like I meant something. He was everything I wanted to be. Funny, extroverted, talented, likeable. But I\u2019ve learned that I don\u2019t deserve a friend. I deserve nothing. I end up infecting everything good in my life with my toxicity. I realized that being lonely isn\u2019t really my choice but a circumstance I deal with because of what kind of person I am. I am a terrible human, with the worst personality that anyone could have. I didn\u2019t deserve him. He tried his best. He gave me two chances before he said he couldn\u2019t take it anymore. I incorrectly assumed that the length of our friendship would stop him from disappearing. How could anyone throw away two years of talking to someone basically daily? But I was wrong. I\u2019ve reached out twice in the past two months. Once to wish him a happy birthday. The other just to let him know that I miss him. Both have gone unanswered. And both have hurt me beyond words. I want to hope he will come back, but his lack of a response is a reality check. He will never speak to me again. I will never hear his contagious laughter. His funny stories. I will never have someone to discuss music with. No one will tease me about not knowing who Queen is ever again. And I feel so empty. So alone. Only this time the loneliness is not welcome.

It just doesn't seem right at all. I sometimes wonder if fate perhaps thinks the same, which is why I've never had a relationship where I wasn't the only one to get hurt.  \nI sometimes think too that I don't deserve friends, but I generally can't do any good to anyone without friends so I have to keep other people around in order to care for them.   \n\n\nRecently, however, I've realised that a lot of my ways of thinking are arrogant.

Making repairs as an astronaut and just suffocating to death in dark, cold, quiet space...floating endlessly into the void completely absent of life. \n\nThese thoughts are so intense and vivid that I create entire plots to them.

I moved from my parents house to a new house in another city to study.\nThe house that I live has many others guys, but I don't talk more than a phrase with 'em. So I don't talk to anyone during all day.\nMy high school friends are gone after 1 year that I finished school, my friends from my last college also stopped to talk to me when I leave (before even I told thar i was moving) and well, that's every possible friendship contacts that I had in my life, people that study with me and now they gone, because the only thing that make me be friend with they was just my presence.\nSo basically the only person I talk during all day about stuffs is my mom. I send a message to her talking about random things during all day, but I have noticed that sometimes she's like \"Uhum, okay now why you're talking about every single breath you take during the day, it's enough right?\" and she's right.\nI always was the guy with no friends that don't talk to anyone, but now when everyone really delete me from they social circle I feel that hiting me hard. I was listening to the BROCKHAMPTON song \"Lamb\" and I can say the same thing as they sing in they hook.\nWhat I can do? I'm like different from everyone in my college, my color, social condition, tastes, everything is different and they don't even know my name. That's a method that I can make someone see me as I'm?

But I'm kinda new to this subreddit. \n\nI am 23 years old right now and have social anxiety and depression so of course, I had never had a girlfriend before. I definitely never approached anyone in person due to the anxiety and depression, and I was on online dating on and off for a few years with terrible results that even put me off from those sites. \n\nI have been on exactly 1 date 2 years ago and it did not go well. She was kinda rude, constantly texting and playing with her phone, and worst part was she looked much different than her profile pics, which I come to realize were at least 5 years old at that point by looking at some of the movie posters in the background lol. She was much fatter and had really short boyish hair in person. \n\nThen most other girls on dating sites of course don't respond, or things die down fast by the girl eventually being short with me and giving one word answers and we don't seem to click, which is often. Then not responding. \n\nI also was talking to another girl for about 6 months who I met on a specific dating site for people with disabilities, that did not go well. I told her I liked her too soon, though we still kept talking for months until she got really busy, stopped responding regularly, I lashed out at her for that, and she eventually ghosted me and I found out she changed her number. That was at the lowest point in my life early last year. \n\nOnly once I have asked out a girl I knew in person, during my freshman year of college. First off, I found online the she was actually about 13 years older than me. Though I didn't mind, I still had asked her to lunch by text and she said maybe and that it was nice I asked. Nothing happened. I found out at some point after the class we shared was over that she was engaged. \n\nI am still in college about to finish. Never really had any friends growing up or any girl that ever talked to me in school. Besides in middle and high school where I was super awkward and pushed them away. Sometimes, I feel that I am ugly so I know that no girls are attracted to me or talk to me possibly because of that. (PM me if you want to see me)\n\nNow to the main event, I recently became good friends with someone on a site (won't publicly say what) after initially asking her questions about some stuff I wanted that she was selling. Then we started talking more and I found out we had so much in common and both agreed to become friends, it is an online thing. I knew she had a bf because it was actually mentioned on her profile bio on how they are both very passionate about she likes and sells. And she even tells her bf and other friends about me and says they really like me as well. Out of everyone I ever spoken to online or anything, she seems to click the most with me. She actually messages me first as opposed to it being up to me to chase 100% of the time, she actually remembers things about me as well and always seems really interested in what I say, she even likes things that I post on sites like fb. She is always so nice to me and tells me she has fun talking to me. Compliments me a lot, so on. I just every now and then have feelings for her because I never could find people with my weird quirky interests that most people find odd and tell me I should just get new interests. I don't know what to do about the feelings. But I really love being friends with her so much. \n\nIt's not just her, but girls I read about online or see on things like IG that look like my kind of girl, are always taken. I hate that so much and feel like I'd never find someone of my very own. \n\nWhat should I do? I know many people probably go through this too.

My junior year of high school I enrolled in a local community college and have gotten enough credits to graduate a year early from high school. I\u2019m so proud of my achievements and I have been able to be very successful even though I suffer from depression. \n\nHowever, with all of that being said, I have not made any meaningful connections. I was bullied through grades 6-10 and had to leave my original high school because the racism was so bad. At my new high school, I immediately enrolled into community college (dual enrollment) and had primarily adults in my classes (ages early 20s -50s). Even the connections I made with my peers while I was in my high school I completely ended because I was so focused on getting into college and having the best scores on my tests. \n\nAs I\u2019m getting closer and closer to my goal of getting into college, I look back and see that I have no one. I have stacks of certificates and a shelf of trophies but not a single friend. This is my only social media app because I don\u2019t have anyone to add on Instagram or Snapchat. Because I\u2019m graduating early (which was unexpected), I\u2019m not going to prom, I\u2019m not going on senior trip, senior skip day, yearbook signing, or even graduation. I feel bad that I\u2019m not participating in those activities because they sound great, in theory. Even if I did participate, I would be alone and feel like shit because I\u2019ll see other people around me with their friends having fun. I don\u2019t even know what it feels like to have a friend to hang out with. Honestly, the thought of being social makes my anxiety even worse. I am so awkward and insecure that I rather stay this way in fear of being outcasted even more. I don\u2019t even know what having a friend feels like so I don\u2019t even want to change my situation. Being lonely feels familiar to me, I wouldn\u2019t know how to even be a friend.

Just wanna see if others can relate.\n\nStart off secondary (middle) school. You enter school as a slightly weird kid, whether that be mental illness, a disturbed childhood or just general ugliness (for me it was autism). You act weird in school because you are inherently that weird kid, you do weird things (or even worse you're ugly or mildly deformed so people pick on you for that even though you're mentally normal which fucken sucks) so you get put down to the bottom of the social hierarchy. In my case, I watched the Big Bang theory as a kid and would try to act like Sheldon Cooper (idk why but yeah, autism) so I would talk in this weird posh accent, call other kids out for being dumb and I would tell them verbatim that I was \"mentally superior\" to them. This got me made fun of and I had no self awareness on how retarded I was being, i wasnt even that smart i just pretended to be because i wanted to be like sheldon in every way.\n\nSo anyway people pick up on your oddity whatever it may be and cast you out, so you either befriend a group of misfits out of necessity (what I did) or be completely alone which is significantly worse. If you wind up with a group of misfits then they are most likely friendless themselves outside of that group of misfits. Most people meet girls through mutual connections, but what if all your friends only have one friendship group and that one is a group of all males. No girls to meet, thus no way to socially develop, because having female friends greatly helps a man to become more attractive to women as they learn to understand all the small nuances about them (what they like, things to say and not to say).\n\nNow you've finished secondary (middle) school and you move on to college (high school). I joined a new college and thought it would be a clean slate to meet new people. On the very first day however, everyone begins bonding like they've known each other for ages. In desperation, I make a few awkward interactions to clamber my way into a social circle, as long as I wasnt alone I was okay. But people probably got a weird creepy vibe off of me so they ignore me and I end up friendless that whole year. This happened because I spent the years that i should've been socially developing, instead with a group of Male nerds with no social skills. So essentially I have the social capabilities of a 12 year old whilst everyone socially progressed in a seemingly normal way. Then I realized whilst it seemed weird, the only reason those people managed to meld together quickly was simply because they had a normal social upbringing and yet I never got that. \n\nSo let me ask this, with all of these logical reasoning as to why I am socially inept  why the fuck do I get told that it's my fault I'm destined to be alone. Did I choose to be born with autism? Did I choose to be a cringy retard in school? You think a 12 year old autist can comprehend his own fucking weirdness? Did I choose to be this way to be outcasted into a group of other weird kids? Why is it that the majority of my friendship group is in the exact same fucking position as me, and why do people still assume that I choose to be friendless, that I can simply walk outside one day, turn on that personality button and just enter random friendship groups. Wake the fuck up, that's impossible. Not to mention the years of being picked on and name called that have created these insecurities that are almost a part of me now. I mean I have good grades, I'm heading into a pretty decent job position as an electrician. It's not like I failed academically,just socially. There will now be a void in my life that can never be filled simply because I got the unlucky dice roll.\n\nNow all things being said, I still count my blessings. Despite my autism and the bullying that has followed from it, I at least was raised by loving parents who have stayed with me and with each other. At least I have never been in poverty or ever been forced into a dangerous criminal gang because of where I lived. I do have a life that some people would kill for, just by the virtue i live in a western country and have job prospects. However I feel like my life is looking to be filled with isolation, despair and boredom. I will be living paycheck after paycheck with nothing to look forward to. We are social animals, but due to poor fate I must miss out on that side of life, what makes it so much easier to live on. I cant even make a single Male friend anymore nevermind get anywhere close to being on good terms with a girl. Like the kiwi bird was born unable to fly, I was born unable to bond.\n\nI do not hate women, I hate my fate and the neurological disorder that has ripped me from being a normal man. I do not wish to be violent towards anyone and highly disapprove of mass shootings. I am not an incel, just a socially inept 18 year old. I feel an incentive to clarify this because the natural assumption from this paragraph through the eyes of a normal person would be that I'm a brooding mass murderer, or that I am a general danger to society. \n\nI might've rambled on parts here, this is a vent after all.

Out of all those millions of sperms that could've become a human being, you happened to reach the egg the fastest. However, you were not what I would call \"you\" due to not having consciousness. You just happened to exist, not by choice but by randomness. It could've been someone else with a whole other look/personality but here you are. Some people have come to the realization that this random possibility that ended up being them is nothing of an experience but just a tiny fragment in space-time. You could die tomorrow and let's face it- even if you were one of the \"greatest and most innovative\" people in earth the influence of your death would last for a little while, mostly scarring the ones close to you but others would just be alarmed that someone they knew died and most probably would pay some shit tribute. Now consider that one day all the people interconnected in this chain of knowledge of each other will all pass one day and *nobody in this earth* will miss you. Chances you do something remarkable are small and even if you did \"remain in history\" nobody will give a shit about your personal life/who you were/what you loved and stuff like that. Your passing on won't remain in time and eventually your name and personality will fade away from this world. In itself we humans try to do irrelevant things we get angry over which are all driven by our so thought urge to have something in order to feel complete. But guess what- having something doesn't give you a purpose in life because if that thing were to be taken from you, it wouldn't make such a change.If somebody wants to kill themselves, let them do it. You can't keep someone's pain and suffering be just cause you can't bear the thought of death and the fact that this person eventually will pass on one day if not that day just like everyone. Just like they didn't choose to be born it's up to them if they still wanna do this or not.No I'm not depressed I just have come to the realization of how fucking small I actually am compared to the universe and the thought of existence tires me because it's all just a show of a material world with the thrill of survival being very small due to us having everything already prepared for us and guaranteed that stupid little things we make are not missing from our lives. We tell people to not kill themselves because there's so much to life that they're gonna miss but *what will they miss really?* Imagine if the nonexistence off stuff humans do, then they wouldn't miss that morning coffee, dates they'd go on to, movies they'd watch so much right? We've created a planet full of choices and that has made us feel satisfied in a way, but when you look outside of that comfortable bubble we call life then we understand that it has no meaning at all and nothing survives in the end so if you choose to die today or tomorrow, that's fine. *We'll all be gone one day.*", "subreddit": "ForeverAlone"}

I promise this belongs here and leads to where I am now\n\nIt all started last November when I was a senior in high school everything was amazing. All my life wishes were coming true. I had soo many wonderful friends, prom was coming, I was going to be in plays I thought senior year was going to be the best year yet... and then I was alone. It all had started in September when I started chatting with this girl I had math class with (let\u2019s call her Jessica) and would occasionally hangout with between passing periods and regularly conversed about memes. My close friend (let\u2019s call him Kyle) immediately took notice. At the time I never knew the full story but I guess Jessica and Kyle had dated for a year and Kyle broke up with Jessica shattering her heart (which eventually led her to start harming herself and an attempt at suicide). At the time I didn\u2019t think Jessica was interested in me but the closer we got to thanksgiving  the closer me and Jessica grew together. Hanging out at passing period turned into hanging out after school and soon lead to me walking her home everyday. alot of the time even when we reached her house we would walk back to the school just to keep talking. One day we were walking and we saw Kyle walking home.  \n\nMe and Jessica slowed down  until he was eventually a small dot in the distance and that\u2019s when I heard her crying. I asked her \u201chey are you okay Jessica?\u201d She said she was fine and that \u201cshe missed him so much\u201d. My heart broke seeing her that way. \nFast forward to December and I knew I was in love and that Jessica was maybe flirting with me. So one awkward confession of feelings and a fake out at my expense later and we were a couple and I was happy for a moment but then....I remembered Kyle. At first anxiety struck me and Jessica and we had no idea what to do and after an argument with Kyle he said things were all good and that we should move past it. This is were things go down hill. When I asked Jessica and some of her friends to tell me about what Kyle did in the past. I was astonished. She told me Kyle would constantly grope her in public, yell at her, and made her cry more than once, and on top of all of this he took her virginity and immediately dumped her for someone else. After hearing this it felt like a bull ran me into a wall. I couldn\u2019t sleep for nights in a row. \n\nIn any other situation I could\u2019ve moved on and treated my girlfriend better but the man who hurt her was one of my closest friends. I almost consider him family. So I was hurting and had no idea what to do. After weeks on tension and one last fight me and Kyle exchanged middle fingers and parted ways. During those weeks of sleepless nights and my feelings tearing me limb by limb I started to change. I became much crueler, angry, short fused and this along with the fact I was babying Jessica holding back on jokes and actions that would allude to the past...I ended up driving her away. We had fights more often and even though I knew I loved her I\u2019d get angry and lose sight. \n\nWe had two breaks in the span of our two month relationship before she eventually told me she just wasn\u2019t interested. Heartbroken a few days later I tried one last time and over a phone call I begged and  pleaded but...her cold stare and uninterested tone of voice is really what shattered me in the end. In the span of two months I lost a close friend, my girlfriend, and my sanity. It was over right? Wrong. I couldn\u2019t be around my ex without sadness and anxiety crippling me so I kept my distance. Soon my friends heard what happened but none of them reached out. The mountain of friends I once had soon faded away and went to Jessica. She was the talk of the town being popular with all the people I introduced her to. Before our breakup she reconciled with Kyle and behind my back would hangout with him after school to \u201cvent\u201d but that\u2019s bullshit considering in the past she would run away from him in the halls mid conversation and demonized him to the fullest extent calling him a rapist even going on to say that she never wanted to be alone with him again let alone be in the same room.  \n\nJessica was a junior so you could imagine the horror and surprise when I saw her at prom with her date and again everyone flocked around the once unspecial girl who was now the star. By the end of senior year I was glad to leave but also sad that my senior year had ended before it even started. June and July I had \u201cfriends\u201d but not really. By the end of July they were gone and I found myself alone. Most nights I lie awake knowing if I died today the only one who\u2019d miss me would be my mom . The saddest part is even though Jessica has a new boyfriend and is happier than I\u2019ve ever seen her... I still miss her tremendously. Even after everything at the end of the day I can\u2019t bring myself to hate her or this situation because I feel it\u2019s my fault. The elders passed down one rule. One sacred holy rule....bros before hoes.  I was so happy and now with one bad decision....I\u2019m alone.

I\u2019d be lucky if I could arrange a first date. Idk if I\u2019m just boring or what, but it ultimately was just making me feel much worse about myself, so I deleted the app. Idk if dating apps are the way to go anymore. I don\u2019t 100% feel comfortable even telling people I use them; I feel like it\u2019s the \u201closers way\u201d of meeting people. But it\u2019s a surefire way of talking to other single people that you\u2019re interested in dating. \n\nI\u2019d much rather do it the old fashioned way and talk to someone in a bar or at a event in town. Just feels more natural to me. Only problem is that I\u2019ll be going alone 9 times out of 10 to anywhere. The few friends I have are back at school since they have a few years left. And the couple classmates I had that are working in the area are busy a lot of the time. There\u2019s a ton of things to do where I live and the nightlife is pretty good. They\u2019re around to do things with me, but I am always the one that has to initiate anything. I\u2019m never usually invited to anything so I gotta be the one to start it. We\u2019d be limited to maybe going out on weekends once and a while. Either I just need to build up some confidence and go to the bars, etc. alone but I don\u2019t want to come off as the creepy guy you know.\n\nUgh it\u2019s so frustrating.", "subreddit": "lonely"}

I have been feeling really down and hopeless lately. I'm trying to remain positive but it is really fucking hard.\n\nA little backstory, I have been alone without sex, relationships and intimacy for 8 years now. I am 29F. During the last 8 years, up until 4 months ago, I thought I was content. Happy even. I would sometimes have moments of being depressed about my weight, and not having a boyfriend, but overall it wasn't bad enough to force me to make any changes. When I would get depressed, I would just reminisce, and think about how attractive I was, how attractive I would be again when I'd finally lose the weight, and how I would fall in love, get married, and have kids and I'd feel better.\n\nSo I continued to live my life without making any changes. Just floating by. No friends, single, barely interacting with people other than my parents, spending most of my time at home with my dog, binging shows, not taking care of myself, and day dreaming. Lots and lots of day dreaming. I missed sex sometimes, but for the most part, I didn't really think about it too much.\n\n4 months ago my dog, who was the love of my life passed away and it made me re-evaluate my life and besides being really sad, I also became angry with myself for living the way I was, for spending my 20's alone, overweight and unattractive. So these feelings of anger and depression, not only for my dog being gone, but just for how I have been living my life, became all-consuming. So I finally decided enough was enough, and started working on myself. The biggest thing that needed to be changed was my weight, and that has been my main goal. I've lost 50 pounds and have about 70 more to go.\n\nThe years went by in a blur, and it makes me really depressed now that I was mostly content with how I was living. I just don't understand myself at all. I was hardly living. Just existing. I can not stop thinking about sex, and intimacy and how badly I want it. I am so fucking tired of being alone. I get triggered so easily now. When I used to see a couple holding hands, the hopeless romantic in me was happy for them. Or when I would see a hot girl with a great body on Instagram, or in person, I didn't feel jealous or any negative feelings. I just would tell myself that will be me one day, while continuing to remain fat and alone. Now though, I have to avoid Instagram because it just makes me incredibly sad. Whenever I see a couple, I get sad. I just can't stop thinking about everything I have been missing out on, about how everyone seems to be having sex and in relationships but me. About how even once I finish losing weight, I still won't look as good as I did before I gained weight. So why would someone chose to be with me when there are prettier, hotter, younger women out there? I can't stop my mind from going there.\n\nMy teenage years started off normal. By the time I turned 13 I already had my first kiss, two boyfriends, was even in a love triangle. I was doing stuff 13 year olds should not be doing. I had my first serious boyfriend at 17, and lost my virginity to him. Had a ONS when I was 20. But since then nothing. It's literally like I have been in a coma since I was 20 and am just now waking up.\n\nJust thinking about all the wasted time, makes me so angry. Like what the fuck was wrong with me! Why was I so content! Why did it take my dog dying and approaching my 30's to wake me the fuck up!\n\nI am also stressing about things that have not happened...yet. Like I recently discovered the sub r/survivinginfidelity and it just depresses me even more. I know people cheat, everyone I know has either cheated or been cheated on but I never really stressed about it happening to me. But now reading that sub, and other subs about infidelity, and posts on r/relationship_advice I just can't help but dread being in a relationship now. Like that's what I have to look forward too? My future boyfriend/husband cheating on me? It's always with the fucking co-workers too! I'm starting to think that being alone may be better than being hurt and betrayed. I don't know if it's a sixth sense, but lately I have been imaging my future, and I keep getting the same picture. Me being pregnant and finding out my husband is having an affair with a coworker lol. My insecurities just keep getting the best of me.\n\nI do find this sub comforting, to know I'm not the only one who feels FA. Even though a lot of you probably wouldn't consider me FA, because it has mostly been my choice. I chose to gain weight and not even try to find anyone. I never even really considered myself to be FA, but now I am starting too, because I am so afraid of being betrayed, cheated on, and rejected that I'm not sure I even want to try and date. I still crave sex and intimacy though, but I'm not sure I can separate the two. I want both.", "subreddit": "ForeverAlone"}

I\u2019m also sorry that I posted this and then deleted it within minutes yesterday; it\u2019s difficult for me to write about.\n\nI realise that this is a complex subject to write about. In this post, I will describe my experiences as a victim of sexual assault, describe my pre-existing loneliness, and how the former has worsened the latter.\n\nEver since I could remember, I have always been what I would consider forever-alone and very prone to being abused. I don't know why. I have very few friends, most of them online, and new friends can be very difficult to come by. I only have one friend (henceforth called \"A\") who I can talk to about almost anything, we've been together for a very long time, she's been very supportive, but has her schedules too. I've only ever had one relationship, but it's over and we never got to meet each other. My loneliness has been getting a lot worse over the last couple of years. I have gradually lost some connections, and it seems very difficult for me to make new ones nowadays. I often feel depressed, cry over it, and so on. I would say I'm unattractive in general and very ugly.\n\nFor almost a year, I had been working for a former employer of mine who is abusive, manipulative, and selfish. At the time, I was 18, and she was about 37. Fortunately, I recently got out, but it still left me with a lot of trauma, a lot of which I won't cover in this post. One day, while I was at work, my former employer and I were sitting next to each other on highchairs behind the counter. We were talking. While my mind and I were listening to her and thinking about things, she sexually assaulted me. To me, it happened so fast, so I was just shocked. I will not go through the details, because every time I think about it, I can feel her crawling on me, and it's absolutely nauseating. The details surrounding the event that I've written is all I can clearly remember.\n\nAt first, I bottled it up, because I thought I could just let it go, she was my employer, I thought back then that I was getting paid well and fairly, she has a family, and her husband seemed well-off. She's also a lot older than me, and in this culture, people who are older generally earn more respect, and who am I -- a teenager -- to speak up? Blah, blah, blah. Then, I later realised how it really got to me. Because of all the work that was thrown at me and I had to concentrate on, and the mental blockades and defences I had set up in my mind, her actions were time-delayed and the effects got to me a lot later on. I tried speaking to my mum about it. She doesn't believe me and is rather ignorant about it, but she agreed that I was at the age that I have to be wary of others because my body was developing fast or something like that. Fortunately, A is really supportive to me, has helped me a lot, and I'm truly thankful for that.\n\nThe thing is, I'm upset that, nobody (especially people I like) has approached and tried to connect with me very well so as to get to know me on a deeper and more intellectual level. I'm lacking personal, intellectual connections that could mutually improve one another and we both enjoy. That's one of the reasons why I consider myself FA. On the other hand, I've been attracting too many unsolicited sexual approaches from people I barely know personally or I'm indifferent towards. The event described earlier in this post isn't the first time someone has approached me this way; the other times weren't as serious, it was obvious that those people were a little bit predatory, or I knew how to avoid them. It also happens to be that the first time someone ever sexually approached me in an invasive way is not expected (especially of the person), solicited, or consensual.\n\nStill, after all of what has happened to me, it still haunts me, and it's made my loneliness a lot worse as if it wasn't already the worst it has ever been. I start to feel less confident in a way, to distance and isolate myself, not to trust people, and not to feel comfortable physically being near people. I start becoming wary of other people and sort of expecting the worst that could go wrong. I feel I'm not prepared enough if it should happen again. And I\u2019m certainly not comfortable dating in real life. It's making me really stressed and lonely, and not helping me with anything. Despite that, I'm still trying to connect with others, though. How can I get through this?\n\nMy former employer is still out there, doing business as usual. I thought back to when I was there: she has security cameras, but the footage has probably already been automatically deleted since it was actually so long ago, and she would never provide it regardless. I literally have no evidence against her, and it seems like she's been getting away with a lot of horrible things.\n\nI have no-one else to talk to about this, hence this post.", "subreddit": "lonely"}

Most of us have missed out on our early 20\u2019s also when everyone else was traveling, getting to enjoy sex and relationships, going on spring breaks and having more parties. Meanwhile we pretty much were alone, miserable and have no good memories and our youth was robbed from us because we were ugly. Now we get to enjoy slaving away for the rest of our lives, do self improvement in hopes of getting with someone who has experienced all of this to settle for us. Yeah no thanks I\u2019d rather put a gun to my head and blow my brains out. We have missed out on so much that it\u2019s not even funny. Please tell me what exactly do we have to look forward to? Life is fucking worthless to me if I have no one to share it with and at this point I\u2019ve missed out on too much to even care about life anymore. I\u2019m so behind, bitter, angry and fed up with everyone who is giving me stupid advice. You do not have a clue what it is like. Who cares that you made it to 24 and missed out on the best time of your life to have sex and relationships bro.", "subreddit": "ForeverAlone"}

I would invite them to do something and they would decline. No problem, right? The problem is that I found out that they hung out with each other multiple times and never mentioned it to me.

I believed that I was intruding on others' lives and they didn't want to be bothered. If they wanted me, they'll message me.\n\nThat, unsurprisingly, has left me feeling very isolated. The issue, however, is that every time I *did* message first, I got very short responses and they seemed uninterested.\n\nI eventually stopped messaging them, and haven't spoken to a \"friend\" in over a month.\n\nI read this article today (can link if asked) and it has given me mixed feelings. One the one hand, I *am* \"testing\" people by not making any contact. On the other hand, they don't seem to want me to make contact. I'm caught between a rock and a hard place.\n\nI don't know what to do. I can't go on without any social contact, but I have too much pride to be rejected with short messages, if I even get a reply to begin with.\n\nAny advice?

Yes I'm only in my early 20s but my social lifestyle is not going to change in no means whatsoever. \n\nThe blame? My childhood life, why? Well throughout my years from kindergarten to high school senior year I have had serious social anxiety and probably been tagged as the \"quiet kid\". Scenarios like \"shh it's OP turn to present\" or \"why are you quiet\" were common. Pretty sure many can relate, I had probably 1-3 friends thoughout the course of time in school (now I have zero). Got picked on a lot, depressed, sad etc.\n\nEven though my social anxiety has dropped dramatically, I've lost my easiest opporunity to gain friends and perhaps build some type of relationship. Yes I still interact with people at work but it's different atmosphere since many are much older than me, probably like 15-20. Even if they are coworkers whom I would hang out, my social skills are crap. At my age, as an adult, everyone expects me to have established some sort of social skills. As a kid it would be easier since haha we are just crazy kids so errors were expected and we could get away with it.\n\nTalking about school, I sometimes imagine how I would of turned out if my current self existed during my middle and high school years. I'd probably cursed out and argued with a bunch of administrators and fellow classmates because many of them were complete assholes. FYI I was not a bad kid, earned A's and B's (probably 1-2 C's).\n\nWell if you got this far, thank you. That's pretty much of my venting crap. Like I've previously said my social anxiety dropped dramatically but time to time I still get those nerve wrecking moments like when walking in public and thinking people are criticizing me but it's nothing too serious and I could see it diminishing soon. Anyways I'm still keeping that hope somewhere in me that who knows my life may turn around.

Let me tell you what I believe is causing my depression. I have posted here before and here is what I said:\n\n\u201cI feel as if I wasted the best years of my life doing something so dumb I can't stand life anymore. Last summer my group of friends started hanging out with this group of girls and one of them was interested in dating me. I decided not to date her because I was to busy with my business and saw that she was dating a new guy every month and I didn't just want to be just another guy. (BTW she was dating a lot for emotional reasons and not sex)\n\nWhen I was a kid I was very lonely and didn't have many friends. I was bullied for how I acted and how I looked. I was always pushed around in life and never had the confidence to do anything. When I got into high school I decided to take a stand to this bullshit and started building a business. I worked so hard to build my business and was so obsessed that when something wouldn't go right I would want to end my own life. Now at the end of my senior year my business makes about 60k a year in passive income and I will probably make 100k a year passively in the next couple of years. This would sound great to the old me and to many others but honestly I feel fucking stupid.\n\nSince freshman year I dreamed that senior year would be amazing. I would have a beautiful girlfriend and I could take her to homecoming and prom and have the kind of relationship I would see in the movies. My dream was so big but I felt my hard work could make something like this come true. Well honestly it did and thats what the problem is. The girl that I decided to pass up over the summer started dating a guy that she continued dating all school year up until today. Throughout the school year I had to watch them have the kind of senior year I have always wanted. Now that high school is over I feel like a huge failure. I chased money when I had the perfect girl in front of me the whole time who didn't care about my money or looks and liked me for me. Something much better than anything I could have dreamed of. Sadly I had to watch this die in front of my eyes. I can't believe how stupid I am. I wake up every morning in utter regret for what I have done. Each day gets worse as I think about what could have been to the point where I don't want to live anymore.\u201d\n\nI feel as if I am ready to die now. I still hear about their relationship and just think that could have been me. Like yesterday she talked about how her boyfriend got her this beautiful earrings and all day I just cant stop thinking about how that could have been me who got those for her. Just every little thing that they have done together could have been me. I feel as if I am dreaming and something this awful couldn\u2019t be happening. As if I live an alternative universe of what would happen if I never dated her. This feels like a nightmare and I just can\u2019t move on. I look at other girls and feel nothing. I just understand what I missed out on and I don\u2019t want to move forward in this world without her. It\u2019s amazing that this thing I found to be minor last year at this time will now be the reason I end my life. Everyday I am either crying or yelling at God for making my life so hell.

Sorry if this doesn't come together very well.\n\nI swore I'd never be the kind of Otaku that's overly attached to idols, yet here I am, alone, flipping through the pages of an idol group photobook, tearing up. It makes me feel so happy, yet it is so painful at the same time.\n\nThat ideal of a cute girl, so pretty, warms my heart to see. And idols can't break my heart, but I feel isolated. I'll never get close to a girl like that, nor any girl for that matter. Not close in the way that matters.\n\nNo one seems to get it. *You'll find someone*, they say. *Plenty of fish in the sea*, I've heard. But none of the fish I've liked has liked me back. I guess I'm just that undesirable. If only my parents understood, if they saw there's no hope for me and stop insisting on me trying to find a couple.\n\nI've been checking on escort profiles on the web. I already had one experience with one of them before, didn't go so bad. Made me feel human, like I could be with someone that way, someday. But of course, that was nothing but an ilusion. It is sad, isn't it? Nowadays everything seems to revolve around sex. I don't even want sex that badly, I want to connect with someone on a deeper level, to love and feel loved... does that even exist anymore? Has it even existed to begin with? Sometimes I look around, see the couples that just stay together for convenience and think, maybe, love never existed at all. Look, I don't want to recieve nudes, nor I want to send dickpicks (ew), but now that seems to be the norm (so is casual sex) and that makes me so profoundly sad...\n\nI just... don't feel I have anything to live for. This world sucks. Nowadays everything is  fueled by hate. Freaking social media encourages discussion and promotes topics that take the worst out of people. Conservatists vs LGBT+ people, Misoginists vs feminists. It's already hard enough to get by day by day, and yet you have to see people hating on each other without any desire of understanding the opposite party. Hell, I get hated on for things I have no control of whatsoever.\n\nMy love life is a disaster, my career is not that much better. I've worked so hard, prepared for years, yet I'm not good enough to achieve that that I've work so hard to get. No partner, no family, no professional future to look forward to... what else is there? I feel such emptiness that doesn't go away. I don't know where to go. Nothing matters anymore.  \nAnd there's no one to blame but ***me***. Don't you envy those people that walk around the world assuming they know it all and, in their mind, cannot be wrong in any way? Must be liberating. No, I know I can't get a partner because I wasted my youth. Because I haven't made an effort to learn and understand the social norms and ways to hit on girls. Because I can't addapt to the dating environment. I'ts not society's fault, it's ***me*** who's to blame for. And it's a horrible feeling\n\nDon't worry for me, I'm... as fine as someone writing something like this can be. Won't put an end to my missery, not in the \"easy\" way, anyway. I'm too much of a coward for that... I just... needed to vent, that's all. Hopefully the emptiness will go sometime soon.. but it probably won't", "subreddit": "ForeverAlone"}

For some reason, I never felt comfortable even talking about love/romance, etc. It would be extremely awkward, and would get giddy, as if I were 12. I think this was the biggest hurdle. I suppose I was always suppressing my desire to be with someone, until I finally couldn't anymore, and decided to do something about it. I went on several dating apps, and got a handful of dates out of it that led nowhere. I think I'm getting past this barrier, at least. However, I still have general social awkwardness/not understanding social cues. I've also had some other bad experiences while doing this. One of my dates ghosted me after the first date, and I also got catfished by another girl. We exchanged numbers and agreed to a date, and then she stopped replying, and unmatched me. I came across her profile on facebook, and it turns out she was using a fake name on the app, perhaps for a laugh, or just to practice her English skills. I reported her to tinder, and they must have banned her, as recently I came across her on bumble, this time she was using her real name! I must admit, that felt good. I enjoy seeing justice served. \n\nAnyway, these feelings of loneliness and longing to be with someone seem to be intensifying. I constantly fantasise about falling in love with someone, and noticed I can't sleep without my arms wrapped around a second pillow, and find it difficult to get up in the morning. At some point I stumbled across the movie Before Sunrise. It's a bit embarrassing to admit this as a guy, but it really moved me, and the whole concept of it just burrowed into my brain. \n\nI also feel like I've wasted my teens/early 20s, by not trying to come out of my shell and experience as many different things as possible, as vague as that sounds. I remember being 18 and starting university, and reflecting back on it, I realise how socially immature I was, and I didn't realise it then. I treated uni as high school 2.0, just study and go back home, and I'm regretting it now. I knew I had problems, but couldn't be bothered dealing with them. I'm on ASD spectrum, and I guess I'm somewhat behind socially. I feel like with the little progress I've made since then, I'm at the point where most people were back then. I wasn't even on any social media until this year (except Linkedin haha). When I got fb, I saw what my HS cohort have been doing over the last few years, and it seems like most of them are living happy, fulfilling lives.

Health, peace of mind and having enough resources to keep body and soul together are pretty much it. Everything else is a bonus. Yet we feel that it\u2019s never enough. We must always have, do and be more. It isn\u2019t true. \n\nWe are already complete. \n\nThe world cannot add anything to us or take anything away from us. \n\nWe are already whole. \n\nWe over complicate life. \n\nWe want more than is necessary. \n\nWe desire things that will never fulfil us. \n\nWe crave partners and friends that will never complete us. \n\nIf we cannot be alone and be satisfied and at peace, then what is wrong with us? We need each other for survival yes. But in our modern world, we don\u2019t need each other like in tribal settings. \n\nSo why can\u2019t we be alone and content?\n\nWhat is so bad or wrong with us that we cannot be alone?\n\nI\u2019ve leaned to stay away from toxicity. In the form of food, information, people, environments etc. \n\nDo not deny reality or truth. But do not dwell in negativity either. There is nothing to be profited in such. \n\nWe are not missing out on anything. \n\nWe are at least what seems to be free. \n\nFree to do what we want within the bounds of hard realities and circumstances of course. \n\nWe are our own jailers. \n\nAnd we have the keys to set ourselves free. \n\nWe\u2019re just scared shitless to actually use this power. \n\nWe all make mistakes and decisions with limited knowledge and experience and suffer for them. \n\nBut we allow ourselves to get caught up things longer than is truly necessary because we become attached to things unnecessarily. \n\nWe don\u2019t forgive ourselves and let ourselves off the hook when we make mistakes despite being limited and imperfect beings. \n\nThere is nothing to hold onto in life. \n\nA wise and skilful person allows all things to move and flow through himself with no resistance. This is not to say we never say no or push or fight back when it\u2019s necessary. \n\nIt means we never resist the truth that is in front of us. We fully accept reality. We resist nothing of reality. We simply respond accordingly and appropriately. \n\nI\u2019m choosing to live with open hands now. Holding onto nothing. Allowing life to be. \n\nIt is what it is. \n\nI can only do so much. \n\nAnd that\u2019s all I need to do. \n\nAny thoughts?", "subreddit": "ForeverAlone"}

I'll start.\n\n21 y/o and haven't had a social relationship for three years, and have had roughly one conversation every three months since then; small exchanges count. I remember being soul-crushingly depressed the first week of it(as was the norm for at least a decade) and by the 100th day I was convinced I was a ghost and that this was indeed the afterlife. Now, post day 1000, I usually just laugh maniacally at the absurdity of it all, become slightly bored or annoyed with the loneliness, become consumed with abject horror at the past 15 years, or devolve into a full-blown rage.\n\nWith respect to the insanity, recently had a \\~60 minute session where I rambled into the mirror the entire time about how many times I'd folded a piece of paper and unfolded it, talking about something that was catching my eye through a window, making sure to comment every single time I made a grammatical error or stuttered, and made sure to note how many times I'd noticed a failure in vocalization. I also kept talking about how strange it was that same person (me) was in fact the one doing all these things and not person A, B, C, D, ad infinitum. Ended up repeating many sentences word for word and thinking in the back of my mind that I have a vague feeling I've said that sentence before and try to stop myself, but the words just kept coming out. Also kept talking about how very strange it was that I'd been talking nonstop for 20-30 minutes, etc. I can't remember all the subjects.\n\nAlso worth mentioning that it was last night that I had a strange experience: I looked at my hands, and for the first time, I was \\*certain\\* that they existed and were part of my body. Usually when I wonder if any of the \"real\" world is real or not, I get frustrated and just shift my attention to something else.\n\nI'm no authority on psychotic episodes but I've had them before. Unfortunately I have the dignity and self-discipline to suffer in silence; why can't I have the fun episodes where I knock on random strangers' doors and tell them God has sent me the codes that will save them from the government agents down the street?\n\ninb4 don't do drugs kids", "subreddit": "lonely"}

I guess it's partly because of my looks, partly because of my awkward presence and partly because of my social outcast status. That's what I say to make myself feel better anyway. In reality, even when it's a place with strangers, I walk up there, act \"confident\" and still I'm given dirty looks or people laugh at me. Even just getting food from the shop, the person in front of me in line will turn around and give me a dirty look and then turn back around. I asked my teacher what my grade was in an exam I took and as I was leaving the room I saw her give this disgusted look and eye roll while looking at the other members of staff in the room, she did this because she thought I had left the room. This happens everywhere I go. I have the most awkward, weird presence ever that people just instantly dislike me and want to avoid me. Then there are people who show fake concern and empathy on their faces when I'm around, just to virtue signal about how good they are because they aren't being assholes to the weird, socially inept girl. These people are even worse than the others because I can see how shallow their emotions are and I know the second I leave the room they will probably join in on rude comments about me. I also have tried to form bonds with these fake empathetic people before and they've just avoided me.\n\nBefore a low tier normie chimes in and says that I'm paranoid- you may be right but I'm not saying every single person out there does this to me, it's just that there have been too many to count. Also, if I am paranoid, it's probably because so many people have given me dirty looks before. \n\nBefore you say that not everyone is paying attention to me and no one really cares that much about my existence,  yes I know that but people do notice other people they deem to be ugly and socially inept and people DO make rude comments about that person and give them dirty looks, even gossiping about them for a short while.

So I\u2019ve been using this find-a-friend app. I\u2019ve been swiped back but most conversations end up being dry, one sided and lead to nowhere. Well at the beginning of this week, I found this one girl whose bio said she\u2019s willing to hangout and go places. And she\u2019s pretty too! It felt my lucky day because that\u2019s exactly what I was looking for! So I swiped her, we matched and I started off pretty well.

In fact, yesterday was her first time in almost a week that she even *STEPPED FOOT OUT HER HOUSE.* I felt like I was misled by her profile bio. \n\nI just feel like everything in my life has a catch to it. I finally find a girl that explicitly says she \u201cwants to hangout\u201d and really down for making friends but it ends up turning out that she doesn\u2019t even go outside. But the ones that actually do go outside, it\u2019s usually because they\u2019re out with friends and wouldn\u2019t even have time to hangout or make plans with me.

I remember a nice house, plenty of toys and no yelling (though my brain wasn't even full size but thats what I remember.)

I spent a year or so growing up and dealing with parental fights and maturing and whatnot and it gets to me and I fake depression for a while to get a shred of attention from my classmates which fails. A little while later my grandparents think my parents are unfit to parent me, and try to forcibly take custody of me, and fail. While they are not emotionally supportive in any way, they did manage to put a roof over my head and pay for school. There is now and forever an insane amount of tension between everyone in my family, except of course for my perfect cousins and their perfect Santa Barbara life and the perfect parents who aren't even in my family so I never get to see them. I deal with it, and manage to graduate 8th grade with stellar grades in the false hopes my parents will love me for it, and fail. And then summer. Ah, summer vibes. I think life is getting better. My dad has taken me hunting, my mom is slightly happier and I'm living the life in Napa. I ask a girl on a date and she says yes. And then summer comes along and everything goes to fucking shit. We cannot go to Napa anymore for private reasons. The girl backs out. I spend three weeks with my grandparents lifeguarding and three days in my grandma goes to the hospital for a heart attack. Coincidentally the Tahoe trip is cancelled. My grandparents force me to conceal my grandmother's state from my parents and I'm torn between telling them. It works out though and I have one month of summer left. I spend it at home with my insanely overworked father and my constantly angry mother and I play my guitar and spend time with me. Until of course something else happens. My father confesses he simply can't take it all that longer and that he plans to divorce my mother around when I'm a sophomore. I of course cry like a fucking coward. A few weeks later he has a seizure. I spend an agonizing night in the hospital with my mother who scolds me the entire fucking time. I deal with it and I don't cry like a man. But I do cry of course. And they don't care even in the following weeks. High School rolls around and I see it as a new opportunity to meet people. I do meet people and I come home to a worse life and worse attitude from my parents every day. I wonder if I am depressed, and the few friends I do have leave because I refuse to do their homework. I'm doing theater and sports now and filling my life with whatever I fucking can to get me away from home and I don't know if I can take it any longer because crying and reddit rants and exercising and playing guitar and locking my parents out of my room so I can't go to school so I won't get bullied aren't working. I don't know what I have to live for anymore. And as I read over this sad summary of my life I realize it ended a long time ago, not long after my birth. I don't know what I meant to get out of this but I did it anyway. And like a coward I don't have the balls to kill myself so ill just have to keep dealing with it. Fuck.", "subreddit": "lonely"}

I got a more attractive replacement model but she's leaving for Cali for the rest if the month and I have to wait til the third.\n\nComplained about it to my ex on messenger. She's visiting and been talking on and off all year.  we recently started talking constantly again.. I haven't lost feelings for her honestly. She asked to replace the girl this weekend for shooting practice at the least. 3 mins later she let me know she's been seeing someone for 7 months and they are very very serious.

I thought we hit it off.\n\nNow I'm just laying in my room feeling like I just went 5 rounds with Mike Tyson emotionally and I just wanna never leave.

So I\u2019ve been using this find-a-friend app. I\u2019ve been swiped back but most conversations end up being dry, one sided and lead to nowhere. Well at the beginning of this week, I found this one girl whose bio said she\u2019s willing to hangout and go places. And she\u2019s pretty too! It felt my lucky day because that\u2019s exactly what I was looking for! So I swiped her, we matched and I started off pretty well. Anyways, conversation goes on and I find out that she *RARELY* leaves her house because she doesn\u2019t have any money and she \u201cdoesn\u2019t like\u201d going outside. In fact, yesterday was her first time in almost a week that she even *STEPPED FOOT OUT HER HOUSE.* I felt like I was misled by her profile bio. \n\nI just feel like everything in my life has a catch to it. I finally find a girl that explicitly says she \u201cwants to hangout\u201d and really down for making friends but it ends up turning out that she doesn\u2019t even go outside. But the ones that actually do go outside, it\u2019s usually because they\u2019re out with friends and wouldn\u2019t even have time to hangout or make plans with me.

Some of you kids figuring this stuff out while the super wizard sits here with more experience failing to meet people or make friends in person longer than some of you kids have been alive. At least you are learning this now. Unless you are attractive, it's not a good idea to approach women in public. Even if you are attractive you can get into trouble although the odds are far lower than with us. \n\nMost women in public just want to be left alone. Imagine you are at the gym working out and some socially awkward guy comes up to you to talk to you. Imagine if you are a woman at a coffee shop on your laptop trying to focus on something you are writing when a below average looking guy who's autistic comes up to you and tries to start a conversation. It's nothing against those women for not being interested. I hope no poster thinks that. It's that going up to strangers in public is a bad idea. Most likely, she will nicely reject you but sometimes she yells at you, and you can get into trouble with the employees at wherever you are at because you are approaching strangers who are paying to be able to sit there to do what they want. Even at a bar, it's a bad idea. I used to go to bars and women my age almost always walked in either with friends or with their significant other. I asked women and they said, they don't want to get hit on. Going as a group is safer because it's less likely they will approach a group of people. Obviously if they have a significant other, if you approach her, you could get your ass kicked. \n\nThe last time I was at a place where it was acceptable to talk to people to try and make friends was college. I went back in my mid 20's and failed to make a single friend. Most people there already had established social circles. The women had significant others or said they did. One showed me a picture of her and this attractive guy. I realized, I couldn't compete. School therapists told me to join groups. I did and failed to make any friends. The problem was, I was older, ugly, and socially awkward. If you aren't, that's where you try to make friends. \n\nTl;dr; cold approaching isn't a good idea.

I didn't grow up with a dog, a cat, or any mammal. A fish or a lizard does not bring companionship, and I was always desperate to spend time with friends.\n\nIt's something I've never been able to shake, that aching loneliness.

In contrast, my family is small, petty and dysfunctional. I had never seen so much love before, and I didn't think anyone would be able to love me as much as my last girlfriend. Things ended for a multitude of reasons, and I learned a lot about myself, and what I want in a partner. \n\nI'm doing well for myself, I have a career, I'm not in debt outside of a minor student loan and I don't really worry about money.

Not sure how long this will be, probably will be a TLDR at the end. \n\nI\u2019m in my mid 20\u2019s (M) I always wanted one thing when I was younger (16)- to enlist in the Marine Corps. Turned down relationships, turned down money from family to focus on that. It was hard enough to focus on it when I had lost my brother not long beforehand. He and I were never close up until recently it started to change before he died, we never got that chance. I still think about it, obviously. Some days are worse than others. Back to enlisting - I was over 300lbs at 16 which took years to get in the shape I needed to. All at the same time was trying to get a tattoo waiver. After over 4 years of waiting from starting the process of talking to them I finally enlisted. I served 2 years and around then my mental state was shit. I started drinking every weekend, spending those weekends at strip clubs wasting money bc of my mental state. I ruined relationships &amp; had my closest friend walk out on me because of that. Eventually lead to me cutting &amp; having suicidal thoughts which caused me to be separated from the Corps. \n\nDuring that whole time I lost multiple friends, ruined those relationships lost the only thing in my life I ever worked my ass off for and spent years working towards. This ultimately made me feel worse. The downward spiral didn\u2019t really stop for awhile. I did cut more, I drank more. Lost more close friends, pushed people away. Gained weight back and ultimately still feel like shit. I feel a huge emptiness in my life losing something I wanted so badly. And I feel like I fucked it up, that I didn\u2019t try hard enough or something. Now, I find it hard to find something worth waking up to.

I understand that people work, people are busy, in no way do I expect to be talking to someone all day or everyday. But, those who are \u201cin\u201d my life now, I just have had my limit of trying reach out and try to talk. I don\u2019t want to sound selfish by any means but when nobody ever reaches out, it adds so much to the empty feeling. It sucks\n\nTL:DR - I\u2019ve fucked up friendships, I\u2019ve lost friendships for no fault at mine. I lost what I worked so hard for in life &amp; now feel empty and don\u2019t want anything else.

Spent weekends by myself playing TF2 sometimes chatting with people online but eventually I've stoped talking to all of them, even one of them who was the only person in the world who knew that I was going to kill myself (now that Im thinking of it he is still the only person who knows how serious I was)\n\nafter highscool wastnt much easier, I expected that maybe college and work could be a new opportunity for me, that maybe I could be normal. but i continued to pushing people away who wanted to get to know me. there was another girl who I could tell was interested in me, but i didnt give her the same chance that i gave the other girl few years ago. she would always try to talk and flirt to me and I mostly replied in one word answers or just enough to not be rude, she was very nice and I didnt want to be rude but once I didnt have class with her I stoped talking to her completely. There was also this situation that I kinda find funny now, this guy at work is the kinda guy that I would like to be friends with if I could have friends, we joked around sometimes and it was all good but once while we were working together he just came out of nowhere and went \"hey when we get off, you wanna get lunch?\" immediately I replied \"NO\"  he looked disappointed and latter i felt really bad, that could have been my shot at \"being normal\" and my anti-social lizard brain kept me from it. havent heard from him after I quit that job. \n\nFor the past 3ish months ive been talking to a therapist, this is the first time in 5 years that ive had anyone to talk to, to really actually talk to, not just one word response or just enough to not insult someone, im talking about all the things that i cant talk about to anyone else. its pretty difficult for me but im sorta just forcing it out of me. And I think that maybe I am beginning to wake up from this poisonous slumber that ive been stuck in. since ive started it ive been alot more, lets call it, \"emotionally expressive\" a month ago I freaked out and punched a few holes in my door then tore off my shirt (my favorite shirt too) like the hulk and then I crumpled to the floor face first sobbing for maybe 10 minutes straight, i know that sounds scary/kinda hilarious now but I felt really good after. also a few nights ago I had what my therapist described as a panic attack but i feel better and more capable now.\n\nok final paragraph i swear. Man Im not sure why I wanted to write this all down in the first place but i feel alot better then when i started writting. sorry if this is difficult to read, i was sobbing though writing half of it Hahaha. When I started writting it was from a very bad place but now I do feel alot better. idk if this is the sorta thing that people post, but i feel like this needs to be shared. I think I was gonna write something about loneliness on here but i honestly done feel all that lonely after typing this all out. anyhow Thank you for reading, it dose mean quite alot to me.", "subreddit": "lonely"}

Besides her, I initially filled up my home feed with fashion and makeup companies, wondering who people typically follow on Instagram.  I almost never used it back then, but over time, I made more and more use out of the explore page. It wouldn't be for a while until I figured out people followed each other on Instagram. They follow hundreds of accounts and almost none of them are the entertainment stuff. There's a group of people I've known since we were little and I've grown an emotional attachment to them even though they probably have none toward me. I'm really shy, so I haven't spoken to them in a while, so I thought I could take a peak at their lives outside of school by looking at their Instagram, but I quickly saw they're all private. And then I found out they all let my friend follow them and some even follow back! my friend is not very well liked and dosen't have much social intelligence, so that, to me, doesn't make any sense. But of course I could be missing something. I requested to follow one of them because she knows me and she knows I'm friends with my friend, but she rejected it. It's been over a year since and I haven't seem my friend in a while. Meanwhile, I've figured out a new strategy. I started following some private accounts I found my friend's list of followers. That's kinda like acceptance for me now because I don't get that from the people I've known for years. I've been wanting to meet new people. For now, this is good.", "subreddit": "lonely"}

My best friend is my sister.. but when she is dating that friendship gets put all the way at the back burner. \n\nWeekdays are fine. I work a 40 hour job and go the gym 3 days a week so that keeps me pretty exhausted. Too tired to feel lonely.  Its the weekend when I start to really feel alone. When my parents and sister are busy with their significant others and I am alone at home.. doing.. well not much. \n\nThe bullying has left a lot of damage that makes it hard for me to go out and make friends.  I did that before and I had friends or.. well sort of friends I guess because they only had time when something was bugging them and they needed someone to talk too. Friends with loads of other friends to keep them busy. \n\nI only ever had one boyfriend. I met him online and we met up and dated for a bit. It was long distance so we grew apart and broke up. I have been alone ever since.. I stopped counting when it was 10 years.. I dont think I even remember what it is like to have a relationship... I dont think I would even know how to start let alone have a relationship. It would feel to awkward. \n\nI have learned to be alone. I am good at being alone..I fear I have become too good.. I just wish I would stop feeling so lonely.. \n\nI have accepted that I will never find someone to love. I have accepted that I will never have children..  I have accepted that friendship is just not for me.. I just wish that that lonely feeling would leave and stop tearing at me.

We haven't adapted to this new world yet, making many lose sleep and gaining stress from how the world works. And this just feels weird to me, I don't understand how humans are so much more intelligent than every known creature, but we still have primal urges. This makes me feel empty in a way I can't describe.\n\n\"Is the human intelligence a curse or a blessing?\"\nThink about it, what does a dog do when it looks at the moon? It doesn't, it's not interesting for them. But we humans have always questioned everything, trying to \"quench the thirst for knowledge\", but always found more. I heard an interesting statement form a podcast:\n\n\"When humans cast light upon the unknown, we always find more darkness to light up\"\n\nThis is really screwing with me, I don't know if I want to know all the knowledge in the universe, so that I can answer all our questions. Or if I want to delete my knowledge, and get a new life as a more primitive human / animal.\n\nI can't wrap my brain around the concept, \"Why do we want more knowledge?\" \"Can't we just go back to not bothering about it?\"\n\n\nI know that it's good for us in many ways to have a modern society, but I still wish it was better, I wish I could escape and live in an infinite dream. I wish I could sleep forever, and just get a new world whenever I have learned everything I want to know about the last world. I think your happier as a child due to questioning everything. I was very thoughtful as a child, and learned how everything worked by thought experiments, and I really miss that\n\n\nI really don't know if this fits the sub, but I feel lonely due to questioning my existence. And I feel like I lose more and more happiness by learning things. I recently watched a video about an evolution simulation, made by a YouTube channel with the name \"primer\". And the video teached me that:\n\n \"An advanced creature such as a chicken or human, doesn't just pop into existence, they are created by each other. But if there's an organism, basic enough to be \"popped\" into existence, but still being able to replicate, then it would make a copy, with a few \"mistakes\", and that clone would be a new \"evolution\" of the species, so if it countinues getting food and replicating, it would in the end, be an advanced creature\"\n\n(I can't describe it in text better than that, sorry.)\n\nAnd this information makes me a little sad, I feel like we have solved the mystery to life. And know I have lost a little motivation to learn, making me feel lonely.\n\nI am just wondering if there's anyone else being a little let down by overthinking the world.\n\nSorry if I sound like some \"deep fourteen year old\" but I really need to know if anyone else is feeling the same.\n\n\nTL;DR: I have many \"deep thoughts\" that make me feel lonely, and I'm wondering if anyone else has experienced it as well.", "subreddit": "lonely"}

It's the crushing realisation (even though I've most likely known this for sometime, the signs were there from my teenage years) that my parents are never going to hold any grandchildren in their arms. My dad is in fine health but he is in his 70's and my mum is in her 60's, she has a bad chest due to many years of excessive smoking. I find that connecting with others becomes increasingly difficult as you get older and as someone who is three years away from 30 and has been heavily depressed for a number of years now, I'm terrified of the future. Thankfully, my parents are very understanding and caring, I don't tell them I am depressed 24/7 but they know I am struggling. I know that having children isn't the be all and end all when it comes to life but they've never seen me with a girlfriend, and I know they worry about me deep down. Mentally, I am not a strong person and I have contemplated suicide a number of times but due to my parents, I have never attempted it. I fear that when they are both gone, I am not going to be able to take care of myself. I am not disabled or anything like that but they hold me together, I know I should be able to stand on my own two feet as an adult but as I said, I am very weak mentally. I worry about money, holding down a job, if there's anything I'm capable of doing or pursuing career wise, making friends, and of course, getting into a relationship.\n\nI don't like looking at myself in the mirror, my smile, and I have very low confidence and self-esteem.

I didn't think I had any hope, and certainly no expectation of anything in my life changing for the better. I have had a long life, with many lows and a few highs - many of which I've discussed here. But when it comes to dating and mating, I've had little more than breadcrumbs to speak of. The old canard of the average 16 year old having more experience than me isn't, probably, untrue. I have lived a sad, lonely, lost life, with the barest minimal of human connection and comfort. And with no sustained friendships, and of course no romantic pursuits to speak proudly about. \n\nUntil recently. \n\nSeveral weeks ago I was working out in the local gym and I caught the eye of a cute girl. I don't know what came over me, but for the first time in my life I found from somewhere the confidence to approach her. I can't remember what I said, really, but it was far from poetic. I was so nervous that it is now a blur what was said in that spontaneous moment - by me and by her - though I almost certainly mumbled and bungled my words. I don't think my eyes even met hers, to be honest, approaching her had by itself quickly exhausted my reserves of confidence. But whatever nonsense I said, and however weakly I probably said it, I was - remarkably - received favourably by her. I struggled to keep a conversation rolling (mostly about the gym, exercise routines etc.) for a little time, though. I could feel myself beginning to sweat nerves, though being in a gym I could mask that. \n\nAt this point, of course, I wasn't sure whether she was an unusually polite and pleasant person - allowing me to interrupt her routine and to stop to chat with this weirdo from the gym - or whether she actually valued my attention. But in the spirit that I had started with I nervously, awkwardly, asked for her number and asked whether she wanted to meet for coffee. I could feel my heart rate spike insanely, but I kept my composure. Of course, as soon as I asked I felt a deep shame - who am I? To bother this girl? To ask for her number? - and so out of the ordinary it is to put myself in the firing line like that. \n\nTo my surprise, she said yes. She gave me her number. \n\nI didn't really know much about her at that point, other than the fact that she had seemed surprisingly receptive to my awkward, shy and bumbling approach, and that she looked *hot as fuck* in her tight fitting gym gear with her hair tied back. I didn't expect approaching her to go anywhere, and in fact, I didn't even really want it it to necessarily. I had no goal in mind. It was spur of the moment thing. Sorta, why the fuck not? \n\nI did contact her, and we chatted for a few weeks on whatsap. I learned so much more about her, and found out that we have a lot in common. A lot of shared interests. We must have exchanged a good few hundreds messages, texting back and forth. Eventually I had to find the balls to suggest a date. My experience of whatsaphadn't prepared me for this moment. I'm used to whatsap conversations dying out quite swiftly, so wasn't used to getting to a point where I *had to* seize the opportunity. \n\nI decided to send a message suggesting a date - just a beach day, which I suspected we would both enjoy - and then I switched off my phone for the rest of the day. I wanted to build the tension for myself, the tension of not knowing whether I had overstepped the mark, or whether I had timed it just right. I had no idea whether she would say yes. Later that evening I sat down, I tried to relax, I readied myself for (most likely) some sort of excuse awaiting me. she's too busy. She doesn't see me that way. \n\nTo my surprise, she accepted. \n\nAnd the date went ahead. It was everything I would have wanted from my first ever date, though at times I struggled to know what to say, or what was expected of me. On numerous occasions during the 5 hours of our first date, I wanted to touch her in a gentle and caring way - an arm around her waist, for example, whilst we were walking on the promenade. But I just couldn't bring myself to do it, I didn't have the confidence to do something so alien to me. But spending time with her at the coast (we had lunch, spent time together on the beach, and went to some arcade place) we seemed to really click. She smiled at what I was saying, she held eye contact, she laughed and giggled at a few things I said. This was all utterly new to me, these little human gestures of connection, and it really moved me on a deep level to be bonding with an actual female in a real way. I didn't want to tell her how much it meant to me, I wanted to just enjoy the now and then. I didn't want to spoil it, at this point, by focusing on any of that. \n\nSince that first date, we met up several more times, and somehow - incredibly - she still seems to like me even as I have opened her up to a deeper and darker (and less pleasant) part of my personality. The depression, anxiety, etc. And she is so understanding, and so compassionate, and she listens to me when I talk about my fears. She knows that I don't have any notable experience in these matters of love and life (physically, emotionally and socially) and she wants me to be open with her and to learn aside her. It's quite miraculous that I have found her. I feel like I can put to one side my metaphorical rope, as I have found someone who gives me a reason to want to wake in the morning. The cloud of depression has thinned, I wake each morning and want to leap into life - to see whether she has left a message for me, to think about our next date, etc. \n\nWe are now boyfriend and girlfriend, and a few days ago we had sex for the first time together. I can't really explain how much I enjoyed being with her intimately. Everything about the experience was amazing. The smells, the sights, the sounds, the touches. Even her bedroom, with all its pinkness and softness and girly trinkets and it perfumery smells, it made me feel like I was finally, astonishingly, part of a world I've hitherto always been excluded from. The details aren't necessary, but afterwards I held her all night, and eventually she was amused that she had to shake me off. I didn't want her to leave my arms. It's been so long, that I wanted it to last forever. Many years of solitude ameliorated in one long night of cuddles and comfort. \n\nI couldn't sleep at all that night at first. I was so wired with excitement. I spent a few hours listening to her breathing, my arm and leg wrapped around her, *and I felt on top of the world*. I'd done it. I'd finally fucking done it. Here I was. Lying in a girls bed, a girl who wanted to be with me, who wanted to spend time with me, who wanted to be my partner. All I ever wanted: to be wanted. And I knew I'd escaped at last.    \n\nTLDR: Haha. You are the smart one (!!). **I made** ***all of this up*****.** It's fiction. It's fantasy. I'm as Forever Alone as ever I was. But if I were to escape, the above would be an approximation of how I'd like to.", "subreddit": "ForeverAlone"}

In one of my classes, basically the entire \"lab\" component of the course consisted of a single major project where the students had to demonstrate their knowledge and familiarity with the core concepts. Because it was such a major project, it took up the entire semester and we were all divided into groups of six.\n\nIn my group, there were two guys and four girls. The other guy in the group could be a bit of an a-hole at times, but mostly he was alright. I don't blame him either as I wasn't the nicest to him either, there was basically a bit of a competition going on between me and him as to who should be considered the \"group leader\" so a few disagreements were understandable.\n\nOne of the girls was basically an NPC. She didn't say much, and basically stayed in the background for the most part, very quiet/introverted, so I basically felt very neutrally about her.\n\nA second girl, who ironically was also the prettiest girl in the group, was actually very nice. She liked to smile a lot, and at times I wondered if she might even like me. Basically I would notice her eyes sparkling when I looked at her, she asked me to sit beside her during our meetings, touched me on the arm on one occasion when there was no need to do so, and was the only one to laugh at my jokes, and did so authentically, when in all honesty they probably weren't even that funny. At times I even had the impression that she was breathing heavily when I was around, although it might all have been wishful thinking. I would have tried asking her out but because we were in different lecture sections we never saw each other outside of the lab. Plus, seeing how the other two girls were treating me, if I had asked her out and she rejected me and it somehow got around to them, it would only make me look like a complete creep in their eyes.\n\nNow to the other two girls. Both of them were extremely disrespectful to me from the start, almost before I even opened my mouth. They would look at me with extremely hostile expressions, and one of them would make no effort to even try to hide the condescension in her tone practically every time she spoke to me. I tried to avoid speaking to her as much as possible but at times it could not be avoided, and almost every time I was hit with another dose of her rudeness. This attitude would in particular come out any time I had some difficulty working with a new computer program we all had to download as part of the project. My IT skills are admittedly not the best, but I wasn't majoring in computer science and neither was she, so some gaps in knowledge should be understandable, particularly since she was no computer whiz either and ended up making many of the same mistakes. From the other girl, it was more of the same, just on a less intense level. While the first girl absolutely hated me, this girl didn't hate me but certainly disrespected me a great deal. She exhibited much of the same behavior but on a smaller scale. The snide remarks, the sarcastic tone of voice, it was all there but while the other girl would do these things every time she spoke to me, this girl might only do it two or three times over the course of each weekly three hour meeting, but often enough to make her point abundantly clear. The thing that hurt me the most about this was that it was clear to all the other people in the group what was going on, but apart from the first girl I mentioned in the preceding paragraph, the one who was nice to me, nobody ever took my side. They just didn't care. It got to the point where I would practically have an anxiety attack before each meeting as I anticipated what new insults and rude comments I would have to hear that day. If it weren't for the nice girl, I probably would have tried to find a way to switch groups even if it meant having to withdraw from the course because the insults were just so difficult to take. \n\nAnd finally, here's the icing on the cake to the whole incident. At the end of the last meeting before the presentation, we were leaving the room and as it turned out, I and the two rude girls were the last people there. I exited the room ahead of them and pressed the button to open the elevator. As I did that I took one look back at them to see if they were also going to take the elevator rather than the stairs. As soon as I did that, I heard the first, ultra-rude girl say in a giggling voice \"Oh, that's so creepy the way he looked at us,\" to which the second girl giggled back \"Yeah, he's a creep\" and giggled some more. They probably thought I was out of earshot, but I heard everything and it felt like a kick to the stomach. Then, two weeks later the final grades for the project came out. A portion of the grade was based on the average of your group members' assessments of your participation and I got only 2.5/5. I have no doubt that the other four participants, especially the nice girl, evaluated me fairly, and that the two rude girls probably went out of their way to give me a 0 or 1 for participation, simply for not liking me. It's one of the reasons I'm mostly opposed to group evaluations in the first place, because so much of it is based on unfair criteria that your other group members can use that relate more to how they think of you as a person rather than the work you put in. I was considering bringing the issue up with the TA, but it would only be 1 or 2 marks on a project that was out of 60, and mostly I was just glad that the whole project was over, although also a bit frustrated that I didn't get the chance to ask out the nice girl.\n\nSo basically, the morale of the story is that if someone doesn't like you or finds you unattractive, etc., they will often go out of their way to make you feel like shit. It's been over a year since the whole event happened and I try not to think about it but even now it makes me feel shitty sometimes because it was one of those situations where I was basically bullied, and just like in junior high, most people didn't do anything about it, implicitly condoning the bullies' behavior. Hopefully now that I've actually written about this event and shared it with you, I will finally be able to find some closure and put this negative event behind me.", "subreddit": "ForeverAlone"}

Fall once again and hurt both knees that were already bruised from a previous fall. I have to work so that will be seven hours on my feet constantly having to bend down to get things. I know today will be painful.\n\n\nI get to work and it's far busier than normal. One of the first people were two young women. One was laughing at me. I figured she was just laughing from a funny joke that her friend told her. I talk to the other one but she stares at me. Then she says guess what and I say what. She says men are cancer. I don't know if she's just doing a bit or serious. The area is very diverse in political beliefs. I'm not sure. I get nervous and mutter uhuh? She says, you are salty. Both were dressed in man clothes. People can dress however they want but it was just something I noticed. The other one is nicer but her friend keeps taking shots at me. I know I can't say anything back or else I'm fired. After I actually go to one of my bosses who's name is Brad. What's funny is that he looks like a Brad. He told me, it was good you didn't say anything. Distance yourself from them. If you said something, they could have just called and I would probably lose my job. I'm glad I didn't say anything to defend myself. I have such low self-esteem I agreed with what most of what she said. I had to move on. My knees are starting to hurt. \n\nA newly married couple asked to print their wedding photos. They were both above average looking and I saw the way they looked at each other in the pictures and in person. That's the look I've never experienced and never will. In physical pain and now emotional pain seeing that look in over 100 photos. Sure, I didn't look at all of them but the couple of large photos really got to me because I got to see that look on large pictures. I know that feeling sucks but I deal with it all the time. They were nice and I had no problem with them. \n\nThen a super or giga chad came in with her attractive girlfriend. The guy looked like he was sculpted instead of born. 6'3\" I guessed, face of a male model, was jacked, covered in tattoos and was kind of a jerk treating me like the inferior person I am. Usually super chads are more friendly. It was like I was an inferior being. I am inferior to him. I can't argue. Day gets worse but nothing I haven't been able to handle before.\n\nIt's five hours into my shift and my knees are hurting badly. I need to sit down but I'm not allowed. It's crowded and even if I could sit down, I wouldn't be able to. A woman who I always see although not the woman I have a crush on came in and gave me that eww go away look. I know she couldn't help herself. We are programed with the halo effect and anti-halo effect. I'm ugly so you automatically assume I'm a bad person. Usually it's not a big deal but tonight I'm desperate for anything to get me to smile. There are so many couples. Some are attractive and some are unattractive but they were couples. \n\nIt's 30 minutes until I can finally leave and I can barely stand. It's not as busy and I'm able to find a folding chair then sit on it. Part of me wanted to hit myself in the head with it. I can only sit for a couple of minutes until I hear get up Anotherguy and put that chair away. That's not for you. One of the last people to come in was a woman who looked to be in her early 30's. She actually smiles at me. I think, wow, a woman smiled at me. I'm chad now. Later FA losers! She bought a lot of things but she pulled the last item out of her basket. Condoms. I think the guy is lucky. I don't even know her but her smile, being nice, and her not giving me that eww go away look was enough for me to think that there was a lucky guy waiting for her to come home. What is another Saturday Night for them is a night I will never have without paying for it.\n\nI get home and collapse from the knee pain. I know nothing is broken because I had an x-ray after my last fall and they said I was fine. I've sat here for the last half hour trying to find reasons to wake up tomorrow. I'm sorry for being me. I know people will tell me that something was wrong with that woman but maybe she was just saying what other people thought about me. I even asked my coworker if I was boring. I didn't mention FA, just that I thought I was boring. He said no, you aren't boring. I rarely vent like that at work but at least I didn't say FA. I'm mentally in a lot of pain and physically in a lot of pain. The worst part is, I don't have a significant other to tell me I'm not any of those things she said. I have no significant other to touch me and get me to forget about her. I have no friends I could go out with after work to try and forget about my day. I'm truly alone.\n\nTl;dr: Woman insulted me along with men in general, and I had my FA rubbed in my face as usual. Also physical pain due to tripping on the way to get coffee.", "subreddit": "ForeverAlone"}

Benning I ran into a girl from basic training who I'll refer to as V. V &amp; I knew of each other in basic but it wasn't until the literal last hour before we boarded our bus for AIT that we start talking again &amp; exchanged numbers. We texted but not as much given as how we I wasn't allowed to have my phone during training until after 1700 &amp; then we were switched barracks where we couldn't have our phones until the weekend. \n\nTwo months later I found myself at Ft. Benning to under go airborne training but was dropped due to an injury &amp; sent to a holdover company awaiting orders. V had told me she would be sent to an airborne unit &amp; would eventually arrive there with me once her orders went through. We had started to text a bit more &amp; originally I simply wanted to hook up with her. But I made the classical Army private mistake: I fell for her. We spent the whole day she flew in texting, trying to make plans. My feelings for her grew every time we hung out, whenever she smiled or laughed I felt happy as the company I was in was under lock-down for drinking &amp; as such became a hell hole of sorts. She ended up joining me at said company for refusal to train.\n\nWe hung out a lot. Spending lunch together, sharing memes, stories together, what we wanted to do after the Army. I remember one time she waited for me at the mess hall, telling her friends she was going to ditch them for me. I had a full plate yet she sat with me as I ate. It was always the little things. By late May it became increasingly clear my orders would be arriving soon, as I knew one of us would leave soon. I bought her a sunflower necklace with her name engraved on it, as she loves sunflowers &amp; has one tattooed on her thigh. I told her my feelings after final formation on the last Friday before I left. While she thought it was sweet, she saw me as a friend something I had anticipated. Whilst I was crushed I was glad we were friends.\n\nOn my last day I told her goodbye &amp; gave her a letter that I had intended if I never told her my feelings. I had asked a few people to look after her while I was gone &amp; to let me know how she was doing. A day later I found myself halfway across the country in JBLM, my first duty station. I texted her. Nothing. Waited a few days to call. Nothing. Eventually she did reply when I asked if anyone had shipped. She said no then I asked her if I was bothering her. She never wrote back.  A month would go by before my worst fears were confirmed by a mutual friend: I fucked up. I had gotten to clingy by asking people to look after her for me. Another friend would tell me I over did it, saying V was annoyed with me well before I left. She was annoyed whenever someone said my name to her. I went out &amp; bough a six pack of Blue Moon, finishing half of it in a state of pure numbness. The person I loved &amp; considered a best friend gone. I just wanted to feel something I told my friend as she asked if I was alright.\n\nI came to find out she was stationed in Germany, as far away as she could get from me that the Army would allow. Literally half a world away I would never see her again. Last I heard she found someone, someone better than me because that's how it always ends. I'm happy for her, she deserves someone who makes her smile, though I've heard they have broken up, as if it would make a difference anymore.\n\nAs of now I have given up on dating. Now that I'm settled in at my unit I've focused on myself: going back to school, getting my license, getting in better shape, looking at careers post Army, reading more non-fiction/current affairs, learning German, &amp; overall bettering myself. It's doubtful I'll ever find someone, especially as relationships for lowly enlisted (E-4 &amp; below) can be tricky. I've long since come to accept I'm going to forever alone &amp; have come to embrace it as best I can.\n\nEdit: A few friends told me she kept the necklace. She never got rid. Why? I don't know. A part of me likes to think she cares but I'm fooling myself.", "subreddit": "ForeverAlone"}

Also it doesn't have to be but please live in the U.S. because I plan to meet up one day if we ever get close but other countries are welcomed would just make it easier. \n\nWell that all ill tell you more about my self through PM so private message and ill give you my discord etc if you made it this far thanks so much.", "subreddit": "ForeverAlone"}

(21M for reference)\n\nI will say, this happened a couple years ago. Someone i met in class seemed really cool and I told myself if I can't get in a relationship with my crush, then I'll try and go after her. Flash forward about 6 months, and I start to really like her, and my dumb ass self thinks I have a chance because no woman ever had paid me this much attention. For awhile she had a boyfriend so trying not to be a dick I didn't make a move. But come the next semester she finally breaks up with him, and I think I finally have my time to shine. So I go to tell her that I like her to which her response was, \"Dude you're so oblivious, I used to like you. If you had told me earlier we could've dated.\" Immediately followed by, \"But it wouldn't have worked out\". The girl I had come to love more than anything else in the world told me that essentially, I was a semester too late. \n\nI was absolutely crushed, and I tried to figure out what I could do to get that spark back in her, but to no avail. Eventually she started dating another guy from my school who she now has a kid with. Now here's the fun part, because my stupid self stuck around hoping to eventually get her, I became one of her best friends and am now being considered by her and the dad to be the child's godfather when they write their wills.\n\nAlso later I started to crush on her sister who said she would date me if I lost weight (bitchy thing to say I know) and now that I lost it she also has said I'm her best friend , but says she doesn't date her friends :/.\n\nSo now I've gone through two girls who basically said they would've dated me, but now no longer see me as anything other than a shoulder to cry on. And even though I help them with relationship/mental problems, when I bring mine up to them their only response is IDK what to say.\" Oh, and the girl I originally had a crush on still talks to me, but she has a boyfriend and lives in Wyoming while I live in Texas. \n\nLately, I've been terrified at the thought of death, and I realize now that its mainly because I feel like I'll never accomplish my main goal in life, to have a wife and kids. I also realize there are other things to strive for, but I don't see the purpose of it if I don't have anyone to share it with. So I'm lazy in everything I do, because I no longer see a point in it. I also question my own faith, because if a being as loving and powerful as the Christian God loved me as much as I'm told, then you'd think I'd at least have held a girls hand by this point. But no.\n\nSo I hope and pray for everyone on this sub, you find someone who loves you as much as you love them, because as far as I can see, that may be one of the most important things to someone's mental health, and mine has gone to shit lately because of the previously mentioned stuff. \n\nAnd since I'm so alone this post will be seen by a max of 5 people.\n\nTL;DR Girl I started to have a crush on said she used to like me, her sister basically said the same thing, and now I'm questioning life as a whole because of it.", "subreddit": "ForeverAlone"}

I know, you have all the best intentions, but it really feels like you are stabbing me with a dagger in my back and laughing devilishly while doing so.\n\nEdit: I feel like I spreaded a bit of negativity and hopelessness with my post.

Slowly getting closer to each other; hell, even the slow breaths on your lips because you\u2019ve definitely seen that happen in a movie or show somewhere.\n\nBut the moment it happens:\n\n\u00ad\n\n\u00ad\n\n\u00ad\n\n\u00ad\n\n\u00ad\n\n\u00ad\n         \n\u2026nothing.   \n\n\n\u00ad\nIt\u2019s impossible for you to kiss them.\n\nBecause you don\u2019t know what it feels like.    \nYour brain has never registered what such an experience feels like.\n\nAnd sure, you could try it out with your hand, but unlike hugs and touching yourself, kisses can\u2019t be simulated, not even just the pecks.\n\nYou can\u2019t feel it because to your brain which is you controlling the body you use to travel in this world such a feeling literally *does not exist*.\n\nThis is sad.\n\nI\u2019m sad.\n\n^([how did this happen](\nhttps://youtu.be/yJmfqVrwizg))\n\nThank you for coming to my ~~TED talk~~ ~~rant which I wanted to share ok actually that\u2019s basically what that is~~ TED talk.", "subreddit": "lonely"}

I have a small handful of friends, but I don\u2019t have much in common with them other than the fact that we\u2019ve known each other for years. I love and appreciate them dearly, but a lot of the times I feel empty because I don\u2019t have anyone to share my interests with or do things I would enjoy with. \n\nOut of the minimum friends I have, all of them have boyfriends. I am really interested in music and going to gigs, but I never have anyone to go with. I am interested in books, but have no one to share books with or talk about them with. I love films, but have no one to go to the cinema with or even watch a film at home with. Sometimes I will go to the cinema myself, I don\u2019t hate it but it gets lonely. \n\nI would love to just have friends to go out with to a cool bar/restaurant with after work or to see a band, and make impulsive fun plans with on a Friday night, but there\u2019s no one in my life I can do that with. All my plans with my friends have to be arranged months in advance. They don\u2019t want to go out exploring because they spend the majority of their time with their boyfriends, and even if they go out it\u2019s to gay bars where I can\u2019t meet or talk to guys, or places that just aren\u2019t my scene. I\u2019m so young and I\u2019m tired of spending so much time alone. \n\nIt\u2019s been like this for years that I\u2019ve ended up in relationships with people that aren\u2019t right for me, just because I\u2019m lonely. If I had a larger social circle with friends with similar interests I wouldn\u2019t feel the need to even date, because I would have people to spend my time with.\n\nIt\u2019s a weird place to be in. I\u2019m starting university soon and I will hopefully meet new people there, but I just want at least one friend that wants to do the same things as me. I get so jealous seeing big groups of friends just enjoying their youth, going to pub quizzes, festivals abroad, exploring cities, and I just feel really sad.\n\nAfter crying all day due to the loneliness I took a step today and admitted that things need to change, and joined an app for meeting new friends. This is something I felt too embarrassed to do before, but I can\u2019t continue feeling so lonely. Hopefully I will find someone in the same predicament as me, that I can just have fun with. \n\nI even reached out to some old friends today and asked if they would like to go to the cinema, and made an Instagram account to hopefully meet new people that share common interests on there too. \n\nI could have just joined another dating app and tried to fill the gap through sex or romance but instead I am going to look for friendship, so I feel proud of myself today.", "subreddit": "lonely"}

In middle school I stopped talking to all of them for seemingly no reason. I even switched schools in 8th grade. At that school I made only 1 friend even though other people tried to be friends with me. I'm still friends with this girl to this day even tho its been 6-7 years and I feel myself pushing her away these past few weeks like not returning texts or calls, I was even supposed to visit her and didn't.\n\nI had this other girl I was friends with and she blocked me because I was being distant and I just let her go and we're not friends anymore.\n\n\nThe first two years of high school I was homeschooled, maybe I subconsciously wanted to be in an isolated environment? The last two years I went to public school and made friends with this one girl who was also friendless but I'm not sure if it even classifies as friendship.\n\nAfter high school I lived with my cousins for 5 months. I was literally LIVING with them and I didn't form any sort of connection. It's not that I don't like them I would have loved to be friends and form a bond but something in me blocks me from doing so.\n\nI had this one guy try to date me and I ghosted him after a few dates.\n\nThen another guy came along and I was starting to fall hard for him and then I broke up with him through text out of the blue which now I regret but I feel like I kind of damaged the relationship and it wont be the same.\n\nEven my family. I live with them but I don't talk to them. I don't tell them about my life, my hopes and dreams, I don't bring my problems to them or ask them for help. I just keep everything inside. This guy that I almost dated was really trying to get to know me and I just didn't want to open up to him. I remember thinking to myself \"I don't want you to know me.\"\n\n\nWtf is wrong with me? Being this alone causes me a lot of depression and its been getting worse lately. I'm scared that if this gets worse its gonna get really hard for me to go on and I just wanna be ok and be a good person and live a good life.\n\nAny advice is really appreciated! :)\n\nAnother thing, I used to be really sweet and warm to people and now I feel like I've become really cold and heartless in an effort to make up for my lack of boundaries.

If he's sick for a few days or weeks then I'm fucked. It's currently 2 am and I can't sleep because I'm worried that basically only one person cares about me in my class. I want to fucking die. This is the last time we switched classes and I got fucked over. How tf am I going to make it through these last two years with one friend?", "subreddit": "lonely"}

The convo was REALLY awkward to me, because Iam not used to talk to people at all and I kinda noticed that I made her feel a little awkward too during the convo, but hey, when we ended the convo she was smiling and when she went to talk to her bf and *mother*(im not sure if that was her mother but there was an older woman together with her and her bf) she was smiling a lot, I hope that she took my comment on her strength as a compliment :)\nSo yeah, even tho it was reaaaaally awkward and scary and that my day was kinda poopy it was nice to interact with humans again.\nHope that you all will get more interactions (and maybe even new friendships and relationships!)", "subreddit": "lonely"}

I made a small group of nerdy and dorky friends, but we just stopped giving I guess. So the following year, my junior year I met this guy I was in gym with my sophomore year. He was always goofing and seemed like one of those jocky-douche types. He actually was incredibly similar to me, the \u201cdon\u2019t judge a book by its cover\u201d cliche hit me. He is my best friend now, and we text regularly. He introduced me to his group of friends, in which I fell in love with this girl. I didn\u2019t know he had dated her that year before, but gave his blessing. Soon after 8 months we started to fight for no real reason. After that, she pretty much already had everyone in her corner except my best friend. So that was my junior year to December of my senior year. In January, this girl that went to my school who had graduated my junior year, hit me up. We texted, that turned to phone calls, which turned to all night FaceTime calls. We\u2019d watch movies she liked, horror movies, and we\u2019d have a blast. Her friend for about 2 years was obviously jealous and it really ended us. She also had feelings for him, so ended up leaving me, and shunning the both of us in confusion. Eventually I made a similar post over snapchat and instagram, and she reached out explaining what happened with her.

I had an extremely traumatic experience as a toddler in preschool, got bullied throughout elementary up until 7th grade. \nMy mom found this school, it was a Sudbury school and the concept is basically that you don\u2019t HAVE to do anything, you just study what you want when you want and how you want. And if you need help, you ask staff. \nAnyways, this was a game changer for me. \n\nThe first time I arrived there, I was so mind blown. As soon as we stepped everybody was so welcoming, and the person who I\u2019ll call James who became my best friend walked up to me, smiled and told me how cool my makeup looked. We quickly became close, and he was friends with this guy who I\u2019ll call Mark. \n\nMe, James, and Mark were a trio of best friends and we used to spend all day exploring the forest and going downtown. It was literally the best time of my life. But this is where it gets fucked up.\n\nThe school had planned a camping trip, and we were all excited. We packed our things, and drove into the mountains. The first two days were fine, then the third night happened.\nI remember laying there, next to a friend I\u2019ll call Jack and then Mark and James were on the other side. \nJack was fast asleep, and I was trying to but I was reminiscing on the day. That suddenly got interrupted when I heard whispering. \n\n\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d\n\u201cWarming my hands, haha\u201d\n\u201cWith my thighs???\u201d \n\u201cI mean yeah, why not\u201d\n\nSo I heard this and I was decently weirded out by the fact that Mark had been harassing James like that. So eventually I hear James go \u201cPlease stop, I need to talk to you about this in the bathroom\u201d then I hear mark angrily shrug and agree.\n\nThey got out of the tent, and because of the lack of noise I finally dozed off. But then what James told me what happened in the bathroom the next day horrified me. \n\nJames said that when they went in, he was going to try to tell Mark he really wasn\u2019t into him and really didn\u2019t like what he was doing. But Mark got mad, and forced himself into James. \n\nWe were terrified. I can\u2019t imagine how James felt but the fact that everything had just been changed, flipped, set alight. It hurt. \n\nAfter this we tried reporting it to the head of the school. It was ignored. Due to that, we just gave up and avoided Mark. It wasn\u2019t until he did it to two other people that they did something.\n\nThe entire friend group grew apart, me and James grew closer. \nThen I suggested \u201cHey! What if we do drugs\u201d. And in about two months we were full blown alcoholics, and we would ditch school to go on benders. Or sometimes even just leave in the middle of the day because we needed a fix and didn\u2019t come back.  \n\nIt just got worse and worse, we stopped going to school altogether, we stopped talking to our old friends, we were practically homeless. And then eventually we started arguing with each other.\n\nWe then decided that we shouldn\u2019t be friends anymore. \nAnd now here I am, alone, dropped out of school and drunk as fuck every day.\n\nI\u2019ll never forget when he complimented my makeup, and I\u2019ll never forget how good it was to finally have people.", "subreddit": "lonely"}

In school, I thought a girl liked me and I asked her out and she downright said she's not interested in me. Either I am shit at reading people or I was reading way too much into it. The whole thing crushed me. Two years later in school, same thing happens again (another girl). I was flabbergasted, but I was starting to see a pattern.\n\nFast forward one more year in college: I think girl likes me, I talk to her, she says she's not looking for a relationship then, then starts dating someone else two days later. Ok, I think, there was some fault of mine in this whole thing which I won't detail here, but I accepted my mistake and moved on. Or at least I tried. Developed a bit of a drinking habit. I know, not a healthy thing to do at 20. But I recover after a year or so. Start trying to talk to another girl who I *felt* kinda was into me. Nope, she just wants to be friends. Again, I rationalize that there was definitely a part or two that I must have screwed up. Third girl: same thing. Achievement unlocked though: held hands with her once when I was shit faced drunk.\n\nWell, that was college. Now I'm in grad school. There's this girl, and I think she may sort of feel something about me. I know how I feel about her.\n\nBut here's the thing. I'm scared. I can't bring myself to think that someone could actually look at me romantically. My confidence has taken an absolute beating. I'm torn. Am I just reading too much into her general politeness,and I'll fuck up my career by just asking her out? Or should I take the leap and not regret seeing her being snatched up by soneone else in 1 couple of months? I am at a loss.\n\nHere's the most likely outcome. I'll stay \"friends\" with her and her SO. I'll sometimes feel sad. Then I'll go back to numbing myself with my back-breaking work and my horrible habit of gorging on junk food like a pig and other self destructive things because frankly, I'm just a pig and I hate myself for it.\n\nTLDR: Constant rejection has beaten my self confidence to a pulp and I can't even convince myself that someone may actually like me and thus, I'm probably purposely screwing myself out of a \"normal\" life.", "subreddit": "ForeverAlone"}

I'm told that I'm \"handsome\" and \"cool\" but can't seem to connect with most people possibly due to my own pretentiousness or arrogance and a general disdain for this so-called culture that we live in during this present paradigm on earth. I don't want to play corny card/board games with people, see the latest superficial visual media masquerading as film with them, don't want to watch corny television shows, watch the \"game\" or the \"fight\" nor participate any of the other bread and circus shows this society feeds us to keep the docile rats running in their cages.\n\nI've never felt emotionally connected with most people other than a cousin of mine whom I was very close with as a child but fell out of touch with as he began to chase the normal stimuli by what seemed to me lying to himself needing drugs and alcohol to keep up this daily charade. My current barometer for so-called fun is now usually directly associated with the amount of alcohol and/or other substances I can consume while doing it. I'm somewhat an introvert but that's primarily due to my interests and tastes not matching the general public. If the subject matter is something I actually care about (music and film that transcend 2D superficiality, alternative history, how the world really works, so-called conspiracy theories, history of religion, etc.), I usually have no problem even dominating discussions (if at minimum due to others ignorance of what's being discussed) in that regard.\n\nI know that I'm not alone in this but it seems most people of similar disposition hide in the shadows or never express how they truly feel. Unfortunately for me, I have a problem with simply being honest and can't seem to keep interactions within \"safe\" boundaries enough to develop normal personal relationships be it platonic, romantic or sexual. If I'm not thinking about subjects that I deeply care about my mind seems to circulate around my deep desire for death and for this to simply be over and done with. I don't \"believe\" in heaven or hell but deep down hope that reincarnation is real and my soul will land in another species or another dimension. Anybody ever expressed such feelings to their family?\n\nI'm intending on writing a will soon to express to the family that I do not want in any way crying, religious music or black to be worn at my funeral (not that anybody outside the family would ever know about it) as death is something I've looked forward to since a child.

It's not that I can't sleep, I just don't want to. I feel really sad and crappy, there's garbage all over my bed and I suddenly got a flu and I'm willingly sleep depriving myself just to add to the awful feelings.\n\nYesterday was my first day of let's say University (It's only three days a week and very few hours a day and it only lasts one year so it doesn't really feel like University, but I guess it is.) The class was just starting when I got a sudden realization that I miss my high school friends so much and I almost couldn't contain the tears. We were a large group and we called ourselves a family. People always say that high school friendships last forever, but now that everyone is going to a different school, I know that very shortly I'll stop seeing most of them, I mean, one of them hasn't said a word in our chat group since graduation and he's also an introvert, so he won't leave his house to attend to the rare occasions when we reunite.\n\nIt's the hardest thing for me to make friends, I've been told before that I'm very selective with people and I also find it hard to open myself unless I get really close to someone or (in this case) I don't know them at all (I don't even trust my secrets to my mother, we have a very broken relationship) I've been going to music classes for over a year now and it still feels as akward as the first day. Nobody there really knows me and I don't feel like a talk with them would go well at all, and I know it's gonna be exactly the same with the one I just started yesterday.\n\nI don't think I've had a best friend for the past six years and Ive never been in a relationship because I always screw it up. No one ever puts me first. Everyone around me has their \"bestie\" or \"favorites\" or \"one and only\" but I've never been that for anyone. The one who I considered my best friend had someone else in that position and she made sure to show it and I think I might have hurt her or something, or maybe she was just waiting for the moment to throw me away because she doesn't talk to me anymore and she doesn't care when I express that I'm feeling like crap, plus, the last semester of high school, she sort of started talking more with a different person and pushing me away. Our friendship might have been a little toxic, I know I treated her bad too, but I had gotten really attached to her and sometimes it seemed like a real, long-term friendship.\n\nA couple different people from that group started caring more about me, but I have (amongst many) this problem that just makes me want to be alone and push everyone who gets close to me away or move to someone else and I also feel like I might overwhelm people with my problems or my personality, so these past weeks I haven't really been talking to those two either. (I know I suck as a human, I'm sorry)\n\nI plan to study for another career in a more formal University after I finish the current one, and since the new one lasts longer, there is a slightly bigger chance that I'll make new friends (but there's also the possibility that I'll be alone for the rest of my life.) In the meantime, It's gonna be a long, sad year.\n\nI get these kinds of episodes when I don't talk about my problems to a trusted one or when I've been spending too long inside my house without going out or going only to school and back home: the emotions gather up and the weight of my whole problematic life crumbles upon me. I get really stressed and angry and sad and I just want to yell and cry my eyes out when I am home alone. It feels like dying but I guess that taking it all out helps. Sometimes I write to help me cope, but I hate that I have to get to my lowest and be on my worst for my best ideas to flow (even though writing those emotions out really helps). I haven't written for about six months but I'm pretty sure it's coming back.\n\nWhen I was a kid I didn't care about all the superficial crap and I enjoyed loneliness more that anything (I still appreciate it, but it's been taking a toll on me) I was very active and actually an extrovert, I used to be the one to make sure that the lonely or \"weird\" kids wouldn't be alone, being one myself.

Looking for people of any gender of ages from 17-22.\n\nSome of my interest are\n\nGaming- I pretty much game all day and my favorite types are FPS Shooters but im maybe down to play some other idk depends.  I own a Xbox one and a PC.  I mainly play pc now though tbh i just built one in June.  The games i play are Fortnite, Rainbow Six siege, and apex.  But i have PUBG, Dayz, CSGO, ESO, Final Fantasy online.  If we become good friends or the game seems interesting i'm 100% down to buy it.  I love gaming a lot and low key wanna go pro or become a content creator.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnime-  I love anime my favorite anime is Tokyo ghoul.  I love it so much because my life resembles ken kaneki a lot.  But I watched Bleach, entire dragon ball franchise, HXH, AoT, One Piece, Black Clover, Akame ga kill, Naruto, Boruto, Fairy Tail, MHA, Death Note, Full Metal Alchemist.  I seen so many more just cant think of any more atm. I watch it pretty much daily.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThat's all the interest i can think of atm i'm sorry my life pretty boring due to my mental but maybe if i ever get better ill try more.  Im nothing special at all and I don't even fill human at times. im not a ugly person tbh idk i just can't socialize with people. So sorry if i'm boring texter i tend to keep a conversation going by asking a lot of questions\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhat i'm looking for:\n\nJust someone who may be able to put up with me because i sure as hell can. Also if you can please be a gamer or at least someone who loves anime aha otherwise our friendship probably wont work out.  Idk if you think it will prove me wrong.  But again if can please be a gamer with similar game or genre i guess i love multiplayer.  Have mental health similar to mine or at least be able to somewhat relate I don't expect anyone help at all but it would be nice i guess. Also it doesn't have to be but please live in the U.S. because I plan to meet up one day if we ever get close but other countries are welcomed would just make it easier. \n\nWell that all ill tell you more about my self through PM so private message and ill give you my discord etc if you made it this far thanks so much.", "subreddit": "ForeverAlone"}

While you're in the bathroom scrubbing off the cum stuck in between your knuckles, you caught a quick glimpse of yourself AGAIN in the mirror.......... pausing for a moment, you stared at your depressed and hopeless reflection staring right back at you.

But I noticed that not a single girl I had met from last year stopped to talk to me or even said hello to me, even the girls who I had frequently talked to. They didn't even acknowledge my existence.

{"post_id": "ctddp6", "created_utc": 1566372341, "title": "7 Honest Reasons Why Longterm Relationships Can End Quickly After Marriage", "author": "JasonRedux", "self_text": "Lack of commitment\n\nWhen you\u2019re young, in love, and in a relationship, you find new ways every now and then to make your partner feel special. You never miss a chance to tell your other half how much they mean to you. You feel grateful to have them in your life and you\u2019d do anything to keep them with you.\n\nOn the other hand, when you\u2019re married, you start taking your partner for granted. You don\u2019t appreciate them as much as you used to before and slowly, you start bridging a gap between the 2 of you.\n\nYou were overly affectionate in the beginning.\n\nAccording to a study published in the Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, couples who are overly affectionate during the beginning of their relationships are more likely to get divorced after getting married. When you display constant affection toward your spouse all the time, to the point that your \u201csurprises\u201d don\u2019t even surprise them anymore, things start to get a little boring after marriage.\n\nThis not only makes your partner feel that there\u2019s nothing exciting left to do in your relationship, but it also puts you under immense pressure. In fact, you start feeling that your efforts are going unnoticed and not being received properly. You then start to feel less desirable.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t really \u201clove\u201d.\n\nThe worst mistake we all make is confusing love with infatuation. People in long-term relationships confuse being in love with being comfortable around a person and that\u2019s where they go wrong. It\u2019s usually after they get married that they realize they weren\u2019t really in love.\n\nBeing in love with somebody and being fond of them are 2 entirely different things! But by the time couples realize this, it\u2019s often too late.\n\nYour needs have changed.\n\nPeople change with time and so do their needs! Recently, celebrity power-couple Miley Cyrus and Liam Hemsworth, who have been dating for years, got divorced only a few months after getting married. Wondering why this happened? It\u2019s because their priorities changed. In a public statement, the couple\u2019s rep revealed that the 2 have agreed to separate as they wish to grow, and want to focus on themselves and their careers.\n\nChange is inevitable and it comes with time. You can either grow and move forward with your partner or you can simply focus on yourself and your goals first. Marriage is beautiful but it also requires a high level of commitment, patience, and love which is the reason why after getting married, people start to feel burdened by the responsibility and prefer to be on their own to focus on their individual goals.\n\nYou just wanted to get settled.\n\nGetting married for any reason other than love is just not going to work out. Marrying a person who you\u2019ve dated for a long time simply because you don\u2019t wish to go out there and do it all over again should never be a reason to get married. By doing this, you will simply waste your time and your partners. The marriage will soon fall apart due to a lack of love in the relationship.\n\nEverybody wishes to settle down one day but you shouldn\u2019t let peer pressure or any kind of societal expectations get the best of you. Marriage is like a bicycle that needs 2 equally dedicated tires to climb up the journey called life. If you or your longtime partner feel that you are not ready to take the next step, listen to your gut!\n\nYou discovered a new side of your partner.\n\nBeing in a long-term relationship doesn\u2019t mean you know everything about your partner. When you get married and start to live together, juggling through life every day, you\u2019ll discover new things about your lover \u2014 some interesting and some \u201cbad\u201d.\n\nDisloyalty, dishonesty, money issues, insecurities, and over-possessiveness are some of the major red flags people discover in their relationships after getting married which often leads to their separation.\n\nYou didn\u2019t \u201cclick\u201d like you thought you would.\n\nMost of us have unrealistic expectations when it comes to relationships and marriage. The image of the \u2019perfect happy life\u2019 pops up in our heads thanks to having been brainwashed by movies and it\u2019s not even close to reality. Your partner is not going to complete your sentences or memorize everything you like. Not every day is going to be full of sunshine. There will be times where your partner feels a little off and days when you need your space. Marriages work on mutual understanding.\n\nCouples who rush into getting married without giving it deep thought, thinking that everything will work out because they have known each other for so long, end up divorcing each other after only a few months because they\u2019re likely not mentally ready for the responsibilities that come with the entire package. They feel disappointed when reality hits them and overwhelmed by the commitment marriage requires to function correctly.\n\nHave you ever had your heart broken by a loved one?

Later, after they both quit, they ended up getting together after their relationships ended up not working out.\n\nBut the truth is that she and her guy were probably a better match anyway.  They seemed to always really get each other and their facebook/instagram is full of nothing but pictures of how happy they are.  That includes the baby pictures I am seeing now.  I could tell even before that they were a really good match.  I'm glad I never ended up asking her out because it sounds like they both hit the jackpot with each other.  Only thing that is a bummer is that she stopped talking to me when she left.  I think the guy might have figured out that I was into her and didn't want us talking anymore, or she felt uncomfortable being friendly if she knew it.\n\nEither way, I feel like I should be bitter and jealous, but is it wrong that I actually feel a sense of relief?  Every girl I never asked out is probably better off now than she would have been with an unattractive guy on the spectrum with little to no experience in romance or sexual experiences.\n\nNo real point to this, I just felt like sharing.", "subreddit": "ForeverAlone"}

It started out alright and I had a bit of motivation/drive, but now it's completely gone. My computer died so I can't play video games or talk to my online friends, I have no real life friends who want to text me or hang out, I can't stop watching porn, masturbating, and mindlessly browing Reddit/Youtube, and I never leave my bed unless I want to eat because there's nothing worth doing in or out of my house.\n\nThe only times I ever feel happy are when I'm around people, and when I play guitar, but people are only around me when they are forced to be, like at school or family gatherings. Nobody specifically wants me there, but they can't kick me out. And I have fun playing guitar for 5 minutes but then I realize that I'm playing the same 5 notes in different keys because I have no motivation to learn anything new.\n\nTo be honest, I didn't even realize how bad I've gotten until 2 days ago. I waa thinking about the meaning of my life and I realized that nothing has meaning to me anymore other than human interaction, but of course I never get that because nobody outside of my family wants to be around me.\n\nMaybe I'm depressed. I'm probably not, but who knows. I don't take myself seriously enough to get it checked out. Neither does anyone else.\n\nSo I'll probably feel a lot better when school starts because I'll be around people again.

About building a relationship fast or slow. Either start with romance immediately or be friendzoned, or start as friends so as not to get maced for being too ugly.... Or awkward.\n\n\n\nUgly is maybe a misnomer, other than looking overall unfortunate, with a fat face, awful acne, and a slightly asymmetrical face that had zero hope of ever having a beard, top this with skin that won't tan in the sun, and doesnt even change a shade after using a self tanner(learned this one recently)... I mean that doesn't sound great but it's not the ugliest mug I've seen in person. \n\n\n\nAwkward now this is maybe more spot on but at the same time it covers a tremendous amount of ground. I'm awkward as hell, but in ways that I see many people get away with no problem. They ask invasive questions, talk about weird hobbies, make extremely intense eye contact, scratch themselves.... while the only \"awkward\" thing I can identify about myself is I take a while to get the words together for an answer. I'm not as loud or attention hungry as others, and I never seem to know exactly where to fit in to a multisided conversation, and by the time I get a thought translated to words the conversation has flowed a few topics past already.\n\n\n\nThese are the two big FA things that get cited the most, ugly either through genetics or poor self care, and awkward, in so many ways we would need a book to label, categorize, and explain them. But what is it, our individual special blend that makes so many of us irredeemable. Why can't I get even a single person to like me? Well I guess perspective is in order.\n\n\n\nWhen you start working at a new place there is this getting to know people phase. My last large workplace that went a little something like this. While being trained I received the barest bones basics of how to do something before being left alone to do it. On break if I sat at a table alone even if it was the only table with seats people would stand rather than sit. If I sat with others they would either leave immediately or just suddenly become obsessed with their phones. If I entered a room where I heard talking the conversation would end the moment I was noticed, and start again the second I left. I have rather sharp ears and though no one ever said anything about me to my face the words \"creepy, weirdo, oddball, and gross\" were directed at me by people who don't realize how sharp and autists ears can be. Especially to higher frequency voices whispering(....female)\n\n\n\nI could go back to every place I've ever worked or even back to schooling and this pattern is maintained completely and perfectly(though the further you go back the more agression and violence against me gets sprinkled in). This is the way the world reacts to us who are undesirable. And the only advice we get for it is to either get used to the solitude, or to go and make those people like you, while simultaneously not caring if anyone likes you. This shit is an insurmountable obstacle we are constantly being told isn't even there, and I'd like to just know why. Why am I perceived to be so valueless.", "subreddit": "ForeverAlone"}

She was the woman of my dreams. Now I feel like I have no one. Im lost. Now I\u2019m back to surfing the web all the time and watching tv, I spent the last three years revolving my life around her and now that she\u2019s gone I feel so lost. A lot of thinking has led me to the conclusion that we spend way too much time on our phones, on social media, watching tv, etc. We\u2019re not living. We\u2019re not in touch with our nature selves anymore. And over half the people in the world are either lonely or depressed. I want to get a group going.  Whether you\u2019re depressed because of a relationship, or you haven\u2019t had human contact in years, and everything in between, let\u2019s get something going. Let\u2019s meet up, maybe start a project or go do volunteer services. I want to form a group. It starts with two people, and maybe eventually we could save lives and extend even beyond Long Island. In our group, no one gets left behind. I\u2019m thinking big with this one guys. If you feel stuck, depressed, anxious, lazy, or lonely and you want to do something to start making a change, let\u2019s start right here. Regardless of gender, race, etc, everybody is welcome. If you feel like you don\u2019t have a place, you\u2019re welcome here. Let me go over some of what I want to achieve.\n\n- A support group for anyone that is lonely, depressed, anxious, isolated, or has no one\n\n- Come up with actual plans to get each person to a better place in life, whether it\u2019s to stop drinking, or get a job, or build confidence, etc, anything you can think of\n\n- Group projects that could involve volunteer work and other stuff (we\u2019ll come up with it as a group)\n\n- A weekly log for people to document their changes\n\n- Weekly \u201cmissions\u201d like doing something nice for somebody or reconnecting with a family member or apologizing to somebody you wronged or don\u2019t use social media for the full week, etc\n\n- Embracing more of the Stoic lifestyle. If you don\u2019t know much about Stoicism then research it a bit, it\u2019s great stuff. There\u2019s even a subreddit on here for it\n\n- Building a fun close community where each person has your back and motivates you to succeed\n\n- Transform yourself into the kind of person that other people want to follow. Be the example\n\n- Focusing on building a community that helps and motivates others\n\n-Become the best version of yourself, even better than you thought possible\n\nRemember, YOU have the power within you to succeed. When you\u2019re on your death bed, will you be happy about your life? The change starts NOW. Who gives a shit what others think. Become the change you want to be, the change you fantasize about in your mind. BECOME that, the ideal you. It starts here. Your true powerful potential is just waiting to be unleashed.\n\nLet\u2019s change the world one step at a time. Right now I\u2019m looking for FIVE people to get an in-person meetup going. If you don\u2019t feel comfortable with meetups or you think five people is too much, then we can talk on here in this topic. I\u2019m not in any rush to get a meetup going asap.\n\nBtw i do have experience in helping people. I was a volunteer Long Island Crisis Counselor for about 6 months. We used to get hundreds of calls per night. I know you\u2019re out there.\n\nIf you\u2019re not from Long Island, THAT\u2019S OK. You can be a part of the group on here, you just you can\u2019t come to the meets unless you can travel. Everyone that joins I will write their Reddit name in a log book, and if you\u2019re comfortable I\u2019ll put your real name. Remember guys, I\u2019m thinking HUGE with this one. It starts with this post. Let\u2019s see if we can change the world. And even if we don\u2019t, helping just that one person makes a difference.\n\nComment right here if you\u2019re interested.

Than I decided that I was unhappy no matter the location and decided to go back home, and lost weight.\nComing down ti the weight I was before, I was still ugly af because now I've lost my hair.\nAnd still no meaningful encounter, almost no encounter actually and it's getting worse.\nThis lonelines of mine made me discover mgtow movement, when you value yourself and try to be the best of you not so you be with someone but for your sake. Which initially sounded like what I had to hear but now I am realizing that it's making me bitter against women and other gays.\nI feel like my loneliness is making me go extreme and further spiral my loneliness.\nHere I am, almost 30, with nothing to show of my life. And I feel like I'll be on my way for a very long time.\n\nThanks for reading, I just wanted to get this out of my system.", "subreddit": "ForeverAlone"}

In addition, I\u2019m simultaneously relieved and terrified to be in a place where no one already has expectations for me. On one hand, I know that the professors, faculty, and other students won\u2019t expect me to get perfects on everything. On the other hand that prospect if not having expectations is terrifying, and I feel if I can\u2019t live up to the expectations I have for myself then everything is gonna fucking crumble.\n\nCollege is like a clean slate \u2014 I can finally be who I want to be, but as it approaches I\u2019m realizing it\u2019s not easy for me to simply shake of the current identity I have of myself. Not that I want to completely change, but I just feel like during high school I was boxed in and limited by the way people saw me. I never took risks, I did everything right, I got straight A\u2019s, but even though I was successful, compared to everyone else I was never super exceptional in anything. \n\nPerhaps the most stressful was the feeling all of high school was the feeling that I could never be anything sexual or have romantic feelings even though I yearned so badly for it. I just... feel like I wasn\u2019t allowed to because no one saw me as someone who wanted a relationship or was worthy of one. The truth is, I want love just as much as anyone else, but I was always fucking terrified to express it and be belittled for it. I feel like I wasn\u2019t allowed to be girly even though really the only person limiting myself was me. I rarely even fucking talked about anything having to do with my own feelings and attraction towards people, whether it be someone I actually knew or a celebrity. Meanwhile at home I\u2019d fucking read stupid fucking fanfiction and daydream to fill the void, realize how fucking pathetic it was, cry, listen to music about being lonely, and then repeat in an endless cycle. I never went on a date, kissed anyone, got asked to anything, etc. I know that at the end of the day, the only person responsible for my loneliness is myself. If I really wanted, I could have put myself out there. There\u2019s so many people in this world, and if I had the courage to actually talk to people I could probably find someone. \n\nAt college, I have the opportunity to actually persue relationships and be the person I want to be. I don\u2019t know if I can though. I don\u2019t know how to, and I don\u2019t know if I can get myself out of the identity and habits that I\u2019ve created. It\u2019s like a really old ugly sweater. I hate it, looks disgusting and smells, but I can\u2019t fucking take it off because I\u2019m comfortable in it, and I\u2019m fucking scared to wear something other than that old sweater. In addition, I feel like if I do find the courage to put myself out there and talk to people, I\u2019ll just find that no really likes me. I find it hard to imagine anybody ever actually finding me attractive, and if they do I feel like my lack of experience will turn them away.

I have grown up in a relatively good place for my mental growth. But within the past year I just keep seeing a social system that keeps being repeated with me. I keep being bottom of the barrel. Girls don't think I'm attractive, popularity isn't even a thing for me, the list goes on. But leading on to this, recently an event came up. I figured I would have a good time. I showed up at my youth pastor's place, and was greeted by most friends. However some just blankly looked at me and then away, which wasn't unexpected, being as I'm just me. But fast forward an hour into this ordeal. I was in the basement area, on a couch. I decided to listen to some music because no one wanted to give me any humane attention. After a song or so my yp comes down with a buddy, mid laugh, stopping and asking how I am. I said I was good, but honestly I had a crumbly week so mentally I was really depressed. He asks said buddy what's up with his basement, they talk, then go up. I decide to end my music and head upstairs. I tried to calm down and all by eating some popcorn and chilling (he had provided some snacks so what else was I gonna do?). I couldn't really chill so I headed outside where the guys were. Outside there was one of the older girls group leaders and an older guys group leader. The girl mistook me for said guy because I was similar-ish to him. The conversation was okay until she mentioned some things that hit me harder. Like how I'm not normal, or that \"I'm just me.\" Whether she was attempting to make it or not, it really hurt. I have been struggling with who I am and self comparison, it has made me internally extremely depressed. When she made the comment about half of me died inside and 100% of my remaining confinance in who I am went with it.

(Also I just need someone to hear me out)\n\nI am not handsome, tall, funny, or have any good traits, and that cursed me from ever having friends. Well, I have two: incredible people that I love to talk for hours, but they're not on all the time to talk. Throughout my life, I have been excluded. Doing so caused me to have social anxiety, became awkward and an introvert. I normally have a rough time to even break the ice! \n\nI had Math today in college and when I was walking to my seat, someone already took it. The room was already filled, 30 tables, so I stood up in front of the class waiting for the professor to get me a table and I sat in front of the table, alone. When it was time to discuss, everybody in the room talked, oh boy was it loud! Then there was me, alone, in front of the class. I was always a big baby, even though I am a 20 year-old \"man\" (I use quotations because we are told men do not cry), so I was on the brink of tearing up. I held it in. Going back home using Lyft, I realized how lonely I am and how lonely I was throughout the whole day- throughout college (3 years) and throughout my entire life! \n\nToday, I went to school, alone. I had English, talked because we were obligated (though it felt REALLY good to talk to others) but still left alone. Went on a run, alone. Ate, alone. Laughed, alone. Went to the library, alone. Walked by a bunch of students having fun (today was Spirit week, we have it weekly) and just smiled acknowledging how happy they are. Came back home, alone. \n\nI'm really bad at making friends and hard to call someone a friend. My two best friends always text me, either it's me who starts or them, but few other people I know don't even text \"how are you?\". I learned something today about myself and that is that it is I who follows others to remain a connection, they don't bother in starting. \n\nI went to Japan last month with a group as study abroad and keep in touch with a few of them. (We are thinking of going to Japan next year for the Olympics) But what makes me depressed is that NONE of them ever ask about my well-being. Sure we talk and make jokes, but it's not on a daily basis. There was this one guy in particular who I hung out for the majority and I was glad to think we were becoming friends.. until we came back to the states. I would try to make a conversation but he would just leave me on read or reply with a dry text. I bought him a Gundam as well as a present for our friendship, but I forgot to give it to him and now the set is sitting in my bedroom. I thought the people who I laughed with, ate with, walked with, explored with, would become good friends... but I guess not?\n\nNo matter where I go, I go alone. My two friends are always busy so I cannot ask them, especially when college semester started. \n\nIn college, I haven't made a single friend. 3 years in there, and 0 zero friends nor acquaintances. \n\nI always over think situations and think of scenarios that could happen if I stopped and talked to a person. The scenario goes a little bit too deep and I get lonely just by thinking about it. It's not plausible what I think can become reality.\n\nI always think of how lonely my future will be. How I continue eating alone, how I will live alone, and how I will die alone.\n\nI want friends and I feel like I am a weird, awkward, not so easy person to click with. Hell, I don't even know what a normal conversation is. What should I do?

It must be incredible to give yourself up to someone like that.\n\nIt's gnawing me on the inside. You have no idea. I feel like crying. I feel like I can't open up. I'm trapped, claustrophobic. I  sometimes have trouble breathing correctly; shallow, or stilted breaths.\n\nThis is my anxiety problem. I wish I could love.", "subreddit": "lonely"}

He's the friend I've had the longest, and he's the only one I still have from school. Not like I had more than like 4 friends in school at any time but you get the picture. His name is Evan. I don't feel obliged to using a fake name because I know he'll never see this. He doesn't use Reddit and even he did, he wouldn't come here. \n\nAt the time I met Evan, I was already a lonely boy. I had just stopped taking Concerta for my ADD and one of the side effects of that drug was that it kept me thinned out. When I stopped, I began to balloon with fat as I comforted myself with food. I hadn't many friends, as a given. From what I can still remember, I had this one kid Angel, and I think that was it.\n\nAngel was my de facto best friend from kindergarten and we sometimes hung out, but by the 4th grade that friendship quietly died. I don't remember how I met Evan and neither does he, but we knew each other because we were both in Mrs. Buck's class. We hung out a lot of the time and I remember being shocked by the kind of friendship Evan let me experience. Up until that point, I hadn't really had a best friend. I thought I did because I didn't have the proper experience and knowledge to know that bothering someone that sits next to me wasn't friendship.\n\nThe thing about Evan that has confused me to this day is that I don't know why he and I became friends. *Now, that is* **_definitely_** *not meant to sound like I don't like him or want him around.* Evan is the one person who's been there for me when there was no reason for him to besides the fact that he was my friend. \n\nWhat I mean when I say I don't get the situation is that he and I look so inherently different, at least on the surface levels and probably a few levels deeper too. If there's one man I can call talented, its him. If there's one man I can call unwaveringly optimistic, its him. If there one man I can call *sociable*, its without a doubt him. \n\nI depended on him to always be there and he often was. He was always there to talk. Over the years, I can't imagine how much of his time I've taken up just with conversations about the girls I would crush on, and how I would be \"asking [girl] out soon!\" After a few short years, he would move away before high school, and wouldn't come back.\n\nEvan has grown to be much more than I could ever hope to be. He's mastered multiple instruments and he's finishing up his first album which he wrote, played, and mixed himself. He's become very intelligent and reserved too; I'll admit it's a far cry from his days back in middle school where he was a lot more jumpy and full of uncontrollable ADHD energy. And of course, he's had many girls since I've known him and he's encouraged me to try more too. But no matter what I've told him I'm interested in or who I liked, it was always unwavering acceptance and encouragement. The kind that never felt patronizing.\n\nI turned out differently. I have no talent to speak of, I'm extremely pessimistic, and I, of course, have no experience in that last category.\n\nThese days we don't match up at all. It often feels hard to find something to talk to him about and keeping the conversation going is painful. He recently came down to visit and we tourist'd around town because I didn't have any other idea. That's another thing, I don't ever have real ideas for things to do. I wouldn't know what to do.\n\nI haven't evolved at the same rate as him or the rest of my former classmates. I'm missing so many crucial milestones and I'm socially crippled for it. As time goes on, I have less and less to talk to him about, and even in the face of this, he still makes the effort to keep the friendship, even if only through texts. \n\nI'm deathly afraid of the day he finally moves on but also waiting for that day so i don't have to feel so guilty about not ever being able to interact with him like a human. The day he and I cut ties, whether formally or informally, I will most likely no longer feel the pain and burden of not being a good friend to him. At least then I'll know hes not since held back.\n\nIn every experience, it's always felt like I've held him back, and I know one day, he'll feel like that too.", "subreddit": "ForeverAlone"}

I'm 24M, I was able to get a job as an assistant manager in retail, become part of a video game team, get a car, and move into an apartment with a roommate, yet I have never felt lonelier my entire life. It doesn't help that I have what I feel is crippling social anxiety. I probably don't but whenever I'm in a situation where I meet new people it sure as hell feels like it. \n\nIt's so difficult for me to make friends. I definitely feel like it's my personality. It could be something else. Maybe I've been ugly this whole time but I haven't noticed. I'm nice all the time. I don't like confrontation so you won't catch me trying to instigate issues. I listen to people tell me about there problems or that really cool thing that totally has them psyched. I may not find it interesting but I like it when people radiate happiness. I crack a lot of dad jokes (I'm single) and puns. I get a lot of laughs so they can't be that bad. I play on a video game team. I tried out and me and this other guy were so good that they formed a second team. I moved into an apartment with a friend whom I've known for about 10 years. After all of that, I'm still incredibly lonely. \n\nI hardly talk to anyone unless it's work related or it's my family checking up on me. I don't really have friends. Well, my roommate used to be my best friend. She has a boyfriend now so she spend all of her time at work or with him. I don't like him that much. He is loud too. Ugh. So I don't talk to anyone really.\n\nI'm struggling with depression again too. I have in the past. It was hard not to be. As weird as it may sound, I almost fell in love with the sadness. It was all I had. Almost like Stockholm Syndrome. I knew I didn't want to stay like that forever. So I tried changing my life. Everything I listed above was what I had done. I got a decent paying job, new car, started a hobby and met some really cool people... But I'm still lonely. I didn't realize it till recently though. \n\nI also like this girl. She works at my job and I'm in a higher position so that imagine how I felt when I realized things weren't gonna happen if we both worked there. I knew she was single. Another person said so. Actually, a lot of my coworkers seemed to think that she did like me. I even got the vibe on my own. There were issues going on with the store manager. Everyone hated the new manager. IDK why but I felt like that was the time for me to shoot my shot. There was a reason why I didn't make the middle school basketball team. I don't know why my shot missed. I asked her out on a simple date. \"I'm sorry but I can't\". I had a few relationships in the past that didn't work out so well. My last girlfriend cheated on me. So just imagine how afraid I was to even ask why she couldn't. I just didn't want to know so I kind of just moved on and operated like normal. I mean, IT SUCKED. Don't get me wrong, I had talked to her for a while and it did actually hurt but I didn't want to be super depressed again. \n\nI wanted to take that shot, because I felt like she would have been worth it. If I had her, my life wouldn't absolutely fall apart. I wasn't too concerned about my job. At that point, it would have been a thousand times easier for me to find a job then for me to find someone else that would also like me. I also took the shot because I thought she liked me too. Like I mean LIKE LIKE. I mean, who wouldn't? \n\nNow a few months later, we still talk. We talk quite a bit at work. I'm not a scientist but OH MY GOD I feel oh so much gravity when we are both there. Honestly, if you set a timer for 5 minutes, I can guarantee you she will eventually make her way to me. Like the way light can't escape a black hole. She will tell me about a rude customer, or maybe some thing she read on the internet, or maybe she did something super embarrassing. We might start talking about her life/childhood or mine. She will tell me about anything and everything. Weird thing though is that maybe about a quarter of the time after she tells me about something embarrassing that she did, she will say something along the line of \"Why do I always tell you these things!\" followed by uncontrollable laughter and a rose red face. \n\nMy brain won't stop telling me that she likes me, but here I am. Still single. No friends to bide the time either. So that is why I feel lonely. Now that I think of it, it sounds more like a story about a broken heart but I would have felt the same way even it she wasn't there. I guess I really just want love. \n\nSorry for the long vent.", "subreddit": "lonely"}

I knew I didn't have a chance with her when I saw how much they were vibing so I never asked her out.  Turns out it worked out really well for them both.\n\nToday, I just found out a girl I worked on a school project with in University back like 12 years ago just had a baby with her long time bf/husband idk.  I always thought she was super pretty and she was always really nice to me.  For the entire class, I felt like she was out of my league.  Ironically, when we were done with that project, she insisted on buying me dinner to thank me for all my hard work.  I told her it wasn't necessary, but she was pretty forceful about it.  I didn't want to miss an opportunity and regret it later, and I was hoping that maybe I was wrong about her not being interested, so I agreed to go out with her  Eventually we went on our 'date.'  I tried putting on the charm (we always got along really well in class), but the entire time we were together, she seemed bored and uninterested really.  It was odd since going out was her idea, but eventually I paid and went home.\n\nLater on we became facebook friends and I checked out her feed.  The first thing I noticed is that a month later, she ended up dating a man like 10 years older than she was, possibly more.  A guy who apparently had a lot of money too because she was posting a lot about all the expensive shoes and trips they were going on together.  That's when I realized I was right - she was totally out of my league.  There's no way I would have ever been able to buy all the cool expensive things she wanted at that time.  Until I stopped using social media, I found out this was a pattern with her - when she and that guy broke up, she found another older gentleman with lots of disposable income.  I guess she ended up marrying him and now they have a kid.  A similar thing happened the following year when I thought this one girl was really into me and found out years later that she ended up getting married to a legit millionaire (and a relatively famous one too in the valley) and now owns her own business that he helped her start.  No way I could have competed with that either.\n\nI guess the good news is that it put things into perspective.  I thought she was showing interest when really she was honestly just trying to thank me for doing well on a project - the dinner we had was never an actual date and I never had a chance with her.\n\nFor a long time, whenever I find women I am attracted to, I always check out their social media to see the kinds of guys they are into.  As luck would have it, none of them have ever looked like me (super underweight, non-masculine) so I guess it just confirms that I've never really had the chance to escape FA.

That said, most people have some kind of relationship to loneliness, especially at work, and even if you don't, you are welcome to fill in the questionnaire. To answer the questions you do however need some experience with being employed (either currently, or previously).\n\nThere are no right or wrong answers, so do not worry that your experience or idea of loneliness is incorrect. All input is valuable at this stage of the research project.\n\nThe form should take somewhere between 10-30 minutes to complete (more or less depending on how thorough your text answers are. You are encouraged to be as elaborate as possible).\n\nYour participation is completely anonymous.\n\nThis link will remain active until the end of 2019.

I know a lot of you post about how much you wish you could find a girl to be with, etc. The truth is, the reason good relationships end is because of getting replaced by someone perceived to be better. Couples get comfortable together, and eventually one person gets the idea they can have things just as they are but with a different person. That is almost always the core reason for breakups. \n\nIf that doesn't make you a little more apprehensive about wanting one SO bad, then I don't think much else will help you besides getting into a relationship and getting burned first hand.\n\nFor me personally, I didn't care less about what was going to be the end for me and my past lovers, I just wanted the loneness to be gone. One after the other, I let myself get brutally betrayed in the end every time. \n\nNow, well over a year since my last relationship, my mind is still traumatized and damaged from them, I now have extreme trust issues down to minute friends, I never can see a  happy future for myself when sometimes I used to be able to, every night without fail I cry, sometimes I get so angry I smash things till my arms are bleeding and need stitches. \n\nThe world feels more like a lie and even more lonely than it ever did before relationships. I was never this bad before. If I could go back I would've just skipped relationships and instead worked on myself, learned an instrument or language, or God damn fucking anything but relationships.\n\nEnjoy where you are and don't rush anything.

He is extremely handsome. Not necessarily like a model, but ridiculously photogenic. Even as a straight male I find my eyes linger too long on his face. He is tall, but not in a narrow, lanky way. He just overall has large bones. His shoulders are broad, his hands and feet are large. Even his head is noticeably big. He isn't overly muscular, but he is in great shape and very low body-fat. He has an overall masculine presence that I honestly find intimidating. He is also absurdly nice, and funny, and smart. I have never known anyone to win the genetic lottery like he has.\n\nWitnessing women interact with this man fills me with a kind of envy that hurts me physically. Women are all over him. In social situations he always manages to have multiple women try to talk to him. And they always have a kind of low-key flirtatiousness when they do. Every Facebook post he puts up has a mind-boggling number of women commenting on it. All his profile pics have comments from women saying how he's a \"handsome boy x\" etc. Despite all this, he remains in a committed monogamous relationship with a girl who is unsurprisingly gorgeous.\n\nThe difference between the life he is living and the life I am living when it comes to women is so vast. My envy of this man peaks when his girlfriend visits him at work. They hold off on PDA until nobody else is in the room.. apart from me. It's like I don't count because I'm quiet and shy. Hearing her smother him with nonstop kisses peaks my envy to the extreme. It makes me feel the urge to cry. It is clear that he has her total adoration and love and it is impossible for me to imagine what a dopamine releasing experience it must be to have a woman express her love for you in that way. It actually makes me angry that I have to witness another man get to experience that when I have never experienced an ounce of it in my entire life. \n\nThere is no particular point to this post other than to vent.

Lately, I\u2019ve been noticing that with all my friends, I don\u2019t talk to them for weeks at a time unless I say something to them first which already gives me a red flag.

It\u2019s been affecting my body dysmorphia by making me feel like even if I were to get this perfect body that I\u2019ve been dreaming of, would my friends even care since all I\u2019ve ever seen, people would only compliment you if you\u2019re NOT black. Attractiveness isn\u2019t supposed to be an important part with making friends.

But I do think it\u2019s to the point that they would choose to meet a  \u201chot stranger\u201d over me, I\u2019d put my money that all my friends are that way. Being the ugly friend in a group isn\u2019t anything crazy to me but I\u2019ve never had to deal with that while also being told that my skin color and who I am won\u2019t be attractive or enough for them.", "subreddit": "lonely"}

I mean on other mainstream subreddits where they ask questions and give general advice. Or the subreddits dedicated to mocking lonely young men. For example,  I saw a post about a 20 year old guy complaining about not having his first kiss yet and all the comments were of people telling him it was normal (normal meaning statistically frequent) when in reality, most people have their first kiss at age 10-14, or even earlier than that sometimes. I understand that they were trying to make him feel better but something tells me they genuinely believe it's statistically frequent for a guy to be 20 and to have never kissed someone before. \n\nWhat's up with these people? They don't seem to realise that yes, most people have had their first kiss in childhood, most people have had their first relationship in their teenage years, most people have been to their first party by 15/16, most people are regularly out of their house, out with friends, most people go to parties regularly, most people don't care that much about politics or the manosphere or those types of things, most people don't use reddit,  most people use twitter, instagram and watch youtube but they even do that to a minimum. There seems to be a disconnect where these reddit \"normies\" don't understand that real life normies have vastly different lives and spending all your time in front of a screen, isolated from everyone else is not a statistically frequent or healthy behaviour. When you tell a reddit \"normie\" this information, they turn around and tell you that *you're* the one being unrealistic, that apparently you have been watching too many movies and base your statement on those movies. No, it's not just movies though. In real life, people don't have this much difficulty forming social connections and romantic relationships. In real life,  people are usually happy and upbeat, they aren't depressed and sad about their life. In real life, people are wanted and missed when they aren't in the room, people are truly loved by others. Why don't they get this?

Just word vomiting and getting these thoughts out ...\n\nI've been going out with a friend every week now for about a year or two. He's the extroverted type who tries to bring some social interaction to my introverted life. He's developed a friend group of about 20 people that we'll sometimes see a few of when we go out. I like them, they like me, it's fun during the night and it's always a good time ... In the moment.\n\nThen after I wake up and shake off the hangover I start to realize ... I'm actually just a +1. I'm kind of always in the back of pictures the group takes, always at the edge of the group, edge of the conversation. I don't actually feel any emotions towards any of them really ... Like if they just weren't a part of my life anymore - it wouldn't actually matter to me. Wouldn't be sad, wouldn't be happy, just whatever. \n\nIt just leaves me emotionless, and lonely. Honestly it makes me feel dead inside. Not in like a meme way like I used to say when I was a little younger and being emo - but *actually* dead inside. Lacking emotion that normal people should have. \n\nOn the other hand ... I also feel like I can develop connections with people too quickly and too deeply that aren't reciprocated because they simply just don't form them that quickly with people ... So maybe it's just a defense mechanism I've developed ... A \"wall\" I've put up to prevent myself from getting hurt. I don't know ...\n\nLike I said in the beginning, not looking for anything. Just getting this off my chest and out there ... Don't feel like anyone around me would want to hear this and wouldn't want to make them worry about me ...

I've been traveling a few US states to a couple friends places and back, and I'm even at a friend's now in Delaware. They're not home at the moment. Yesterday I was over in Virginia at their parents house playing VR while they were at work, which was most of the time.\n\nI didn't expect to enjoy VR chat in particular so much. I figured I'd check it out and get bored immediately. Instead, I instantly made a bunch of friends and played all sorts of games, it was really fun. Some girl even seemed to kinda fall for me while I was there. It made me feel good about myself. I was able to get a couple discord and steam names before leaving Virginia, but I don't have my own VR set. I won't be able to interact with people like that for a long time.\n\nOn my way to Delaware I was talking to to my buddy who's a really good guy. Just man to man talk to really keep us awake for the long drive. Apparently he's had tons of sex, from about 17-24 he never went 2 days without it. It was consentual with no problems for the most part, so nothing bad. And he's had a bunch of relationship experience. \n\nMeanwhile, I'm here at the age of 25 and I haven't even had a real relationship yet. It's not that I haven't had the option, I've just always wanted to get to know someone well enough that I think I could actually be with them before I jump into anything. You know, save my first experience and try to make it special. Its okay if it doesn't turn out great, but I figured whoever it is down the road will appreciate it, even if they've had their own experiences already.\n\nThat doesn't make me any less envious of my friend. I can't help but to think that despite doing what I think is the right thing for me, I'm missing out on life.\n\nI guess I haven't been the greatest at keeping up with my appearance and putting myself out there. I know that could help.\n\nAnyways thanks all for listening. Looks like my buddy's home, so maybe I can get my mind off this stuff for a bit. See ya", "subreddit": "lonely"}

Just an another classic story that you heard millions times.\n\n\nLike I said before, I used to be fat a little over 300lbs, I decided to change that at age 22 and went to the gym, lost weight and guess what, since then I'm now left with ugly ass loose skin around my stomach with stretch marks, I weight around 175lbs right now and I can bench 315lbs, deadlift 450lbs and squat 380lbs (weak compared to my bench I know), I thought I would be happy when I lose all the weight, you know you see all these crazy transformations and how happy afterwards they are and how much more attractive they became, I can't even take my shirt off because I'm basically one big stretch mark. I maintain going to the gym because I like the pain and I have nothing better to do and to be honest I just enjoy getting stronger. But I will never be able to show my body because of the stretch marks, I hate them so much.\n\n\nWell, I thought at least my face will look better right? Nope, turns out I'm ugly as hell and my face is uneven with big chin.\n\n\nOkay, let me try to fix my hair, nope started balding and can't even grow a proper beard.\n\n\nThree years ago I decided to get braces to straighten my teeth, I bet there will be an another problem just like with everything else. I remember going to a few orthodontists to get more opinions and most of them asked if I ever had any accident or was involved in a car crash that could lead to my uneven face, fucking lol at least they were being honest. The only positive outcome from this all is that I'm a good candidate for orthognathic surgery, so I've been waiting almost 2.5 years for the surgery to move my face forward with genioplasty to reduce my chin. The surgery is in two months from now. I still holding out hope that this surgery will change my life to better, this is my only hope and last shot.\n\n\nI can't live like this anymore to be honest, I remember being around age 15 thinking I will live a happy life with a wife and children like everyone else right? Oh boy how wrong I was. Later, around 18yo I realized I will probably die alone, so far at least in one thing I was right, that I will die alone. At age 19 I got depressed even more and wrote a suicide letter, but I actually never attempted suicide because, I still thought I could change myself to be a better person, I tried that. I don't smoke, don't drink and tried all the above I mentioned, but it's just not enough, none ever showed any interest in me. I can see girls in the gym looking at dudes, you can clearly tell when they are interested in them, from time to time I see a girl talking to dude in the gym and you can see their eyes are always sparkling and they are all giggly. The best that can happen to me is they just don't notice me, if they do, they look straight away, but I don't blame them.\n\n\nI just want everything to stop, stop all the feelings right now. I think I finally gave up on any chance of self-improvement and ever having a girlfriend, it's too late, it's always been for me. I'm a human trash despite me trying to be the best version of myself. I'm none. I don't remember the last time I smiled or was really happy, I'm just an empty shell wandering around. I have none to talk to. I wish I would just die in my sleep. I can't live like this anymore, it's been way too long. I already chose my choice of suicide, but before I off myself I'm going to wait just to see the outcome of the surgery and next year I will quit my fucking job and travel for a while and then just end it all, because I know I was destined to die alone. Life is a stupid joke.\n\n\nSide note: not even material things make me happy anymore, I just bought a new big ass expensive TV, unboxed it a week ago but never turned it on.\n\n\nSorry for vent/rant post and shit spelling, typed it fast and english isn't my first language.\n\n\ntl;dr I hate myself and even more my body and I don't see myself living past 30yo.", "subreddit": "ForeverAlone"}

On one hand, that's all I think about to the point where I have been having mental breakdowns on a regular basis for the past nine years, I have suicidal thoughts from the fact that I am probably going to live the rest of my life alone.  I shouldn't be this obsessed with women liking me, and it is only women.  I could not care less it a guy doesn't like me, I have had plenty of male friends, and good ones.  I don't care if people think I'm lazy at work, I have always busted my ass at every job I've had, and have had no trouble moving up and getting promotions because of my work ethic.  I recently got turned down from a gig as a drummer because of my drumming style.  Once again, didn't bother me in the slightest, because I've played in plenty of bands and have been told I am an amazing drummer.\n\nBut a girl doesn't like me?  I'm a disgusting creep, she probably thinks I'm a sexual predator, and I'm going to live the rest of my life alone.  I could be crazy, but then again, I've been rejected by almost every girl I've asked out, I am still a virgin(being a virgin does not mean you only want sex), I have had one relationship that lasted two months.  I went through a huge amount of rejection by women when I was younger, got called ugly a lot when I was younger, and it still fucks me up to this day, though I still get rejected and ignored constantly.  \n\nI have quit drinking, quit smoking, quit heroin after being addicted for five years, started lifting and put on about 50 pounds at this point, I've seen a dating coach, four therapists over the course of the past five years, started paying women to cuddle with me(yes, that is a thing, look it up), I have become financially stable with my own car, own place, I have volunteered at various animal shelters to meet people, taken up yoga to meet people, gotten back into music, playing in bands, and for what?  Women don't like me any more than when I was a severly  underweight heroin addict with my face covered in acne.  In fact, they seem to like me less, if anything.  At this point suicide does seem like my only option.  \n\nI refuse to live the rest of my life like this in constant mental turmoil. I constantly feel like I am going to snap, and I want to hurt people.  Not kill, I just want to bash people's faces in.  Am I entitled?  Sure, but every body on the planet is entitled.  In fact, the more entitled you are the more you date, so maybe I should be entitled.  Doesn't matter, because I'm going to turn 30 soon, and I'm probably not going to make it that long before I blow my brains out.", "subreddit": "lonely"}

I come from a upper-lower class family that struggles to get by, so an opportunity like this was one I could only dream of. Let me start by saying this; It is great. It's very fun, and I'm having a good time (I think. The depression and whatnot make me question it). The heat is tiring, your feet and legs start to hurt and won't recover until you get home, especially when you're a heavier person such as myself, and the lines can be outrageous. But it's great. Now that I have gotten that out of the way, allow me to get into the meat of this post.\n\nPeople say that, no matter where you are, your problems will follow you. Unfortunately, this is true. The vacation helps in the forgetting of said problems, but they always linger in the back of your mind. And when they pop through to the front of your conscious, well, it's nearly worse than the way they feel at home. I'm surrounded by thousands and thousands of people, and yet I feel more alone than I have in a decent bit. Being surrounded by so many people, watching them with their families/friend groups/significant others. It can be emotionally debilitating. It truly is very trying on the psyche, at least for me it is. What makes it even worse is that there are people from many parts of the world there, too. People of nationalities that intrigue/attract you. It doesn't help that I'm a dipshit teen that can't keep my hormones in check, so I'll end up eyeing up a girl just to look away and think \"Stop being a fucking creep, you goddamn weirdo.\" I digress. It just fucking sucks being around so many people but not having the balls or whatever to talk to them or to try and make new friends. When it comes to a social aspect, your issues on vacation may become even more grossly apparent than they are at home. That I've learned quickly. \n\nI don't remember what else I had to say. I just really had to vent, because I couldn't really bring it up to my friend or his family. He adores Disney World, and I promised myself I'd keep my issues on the DL so that I don't risk tarnishing his time here. And, yes I get it, I have a close friend. But I haven't companionship. And companionship is what I crave. \n\nAlright, well, thanks for reading and commenting if you do. I have to make it through eight more days of this, even though it is great despite it.

I took my lesson though, I could be more open and engaging.\n\nBut back to the topic. I used to think I missed a chance back in school, well, that made me look out for \"new chances\". Also mixed with being desperate some part of me tried to connect every nice act from a woman with the thought that she is romantically interested in me. But when I looked at these thoughts from the distance I imagined that I either have been pathetic or that these thoughts could have made me act very  pathetic and creepy and I don't want that.

I got super depressed and anxious. Worked 80 hours a week just to avoid my issues. It's been a hard couple of months. So out of desperation I opened a tinder account and made a few matches. This was harder than it looks, trust me!\n\nI made a match with a PhD student, he's older 35 and made the hour plus bus trip to meet up. We both live in different towns that had no direct freeway access but agree to meet at a bigger town in the bay area. It really impressed me that he had no complains with taking the hour+ route on a bus. \n\nWe meet and he was legit 10x more gorgeous in real life. I was a nervous but he looked just as nervous and was insanely quiet. He was so soft spoken and had an accent that I was really struggling to understand. \n\nSince I asked him to meet, we went for ice cream in Cupertino and a three mile walk in Campbell, there is a river walk path that I run daily and he told me about his family, his studies and the upcoming trip he's taking for work related stuff. He was optimistic and had alot to say. He asked me alot of questions and never complained about the heat. \n\nI suggested dinner and we had dinner at whole foods and he tried to pay but I paid and he never once looked at his phone, only to show me photos of his parents and family and never checked the time. We had gone out for 4 hours already and I figure it time to take him to the bus stop. I dropped him off, we missed the bus by 15 mins but thankfully it was just late. \n\nHe looked at me a few times as I said goodbye and later on I messaged him if he made it safe. He told me he loved everyone minute this evening and he hoped to see me when he gets back from his work trip. I then (and I never do this!) said I really wished we could have kissed (lol like I have any big experience) and he said he didn't know I wanted to do that. I apologized if I crossed any boundaries and he said he wanted to but he never kissed anyone before. \n\nHe said he was very socially awkward and wouldn't know if such an opportunity was presented to him on a silver platter. He seemed really genuine and someone I really want to know. People always talk about how you need to be good looking or have game to get a second date and this guy was very straight forward, optimistic and open. Not too often do people talk about their families or studies, it's always what you have and how much you make, and to me, that's a huge turn off. \n\nAnyway, I asked for clarification and he said he hasn't kissed anyone and never had an opportunity to do so. This guy is so good looking in that dark and handsome type with great hair that I didn't believe him. But he said things that resonate with me, leading me to believe he's FA as well. But I didn't want to push the subject.\n\nWhat a chance! I always wanted to be with someone just as inexperienced. I don't see this as a way out or some huge relationship but I look forward to this opportunity to get to know someone new and someone similar to myself. \n\nNow I just have to play it cool for the next  week until he gets back.

{"post_id": "cv2rbd", "created_utc": 1566699551, "title": "Survived a car accident and best friend pretty much told me to suck it", "author": "ksswannn03", "self_text": "So the other day I got into a horrific car accident with my mother. A truck ran a stop sign in an intersection straight into us. If our car had gone a millisecond faster, the truck would have hit straight into me and killed me on impact and maybe even my mother. The air bags didn\u2019t go off so that almost got us too. But we were able to walk away from a completely wrecked car with only a few scratches and bruises and like things. It was easily the most terrifying moment of my life and I find myself depressed and wondering if I\u2019d have been better off dead.\n\nNow here\u2019s the fun part.\n\nEarlier before the accident, I planned to have lunch with a girl from my college. I also have a best friend and she\u2019s going to the same college as me. The girl I mentioned has been ignoring my ex best friend, let\u2019s call the friend Betty for now, and they are roommates so it\u2019s been pretty hard on her dealing with homesickness and being ignored for other girls. I thought this lunch was going to include Betty for a gift exchange; according to the girl, it was just going to be me and her. Not even four hours after the crash while I\u2019m still in the ER with my mother getting checked on do I receive angry text messages. The first immediately began with calling me bitch, and I can\u2019t tell if it\u2019s in that funny friend way or a mad way or both. The rest are things about how I betrayed her and went behind her back with this lunch. Things about purposefully excluding her. Basically the nobody-likes-Betty-please-pity-me card. I told her it was never my intention to leave her out because it never was, but she didn\u2019t listen and insisted that I was lying. I warned her repeatedly to stop, that I\u2019m not in the mood for some petty bullshit after almost dying today and having my mom in the hospital, and I kept telling her to stop the conversation over and over. But Betty was. Not. Amused. Betty decided to escalate the argument and talk about me barely having a scratch, as if therefore I should be completely over it by now and ready to move on with my life. Betty compared my car crash with the car crash of her mother who now suffers from nerve damage issues, sending various laughing emojis as if me and my mother\u2019s situation is nothing compared to hers. And maybe it isn\u2019t. Sure, no one died, no one has life-threatening injuries, but that doesn\u2019t change the terror of knowing that if either car had been going a little faster or if his hit ours a few centimeters sooner, we\u2019d likely both be dead right now. I\u2019ve been shuddering and shaking and thinking about death ever since.\n\nSo then it\u2019s my turn.\n\nI tell Betty I never want to fucking talk to her ever again in my life. She does the same. I say bye, she says something to the tune of go fuck yourself, while I delete her number, block it, and block her on all social media. Betty is gone, and I never want her back in my life. I would never EVER yell at a friend over something so stupid and basically call their near death experience nothing in comparison to others. I would never have said the things she said to anyone after something like that. I figure if you\u2019re yelling at someone on the day they almost died, you\u2019re in the wrong. And it shows me how little she ever cared about me from the beginning. And now, I\u2019m here at my new college after transferring, I don\u2019t know anyone or about anything really, and she was the only friend I\u2019d ever made and gotten close to in my life and now she\u2019s gone. I don\u2019t know how she\u2019s doing without me. I saw her on another person\u2019s post, looking happy and content, obviously just a way to dig into me more. I don\u2019t know if she sees she was wrong or if she misses me, and most of me doesn\u2019t give a damn because I have classes in less than 48 hours and I need to prepare for them. But I feel tremendously lonely and I don\u2019t know what to do or how to reach out to people or if it\u2019ll even work, as last year I tried so hard to make friends at college and never made one. All I have right now are my boyfriend and my family, both almost two hours away. So I suppose you can leave your thoughts down here, messages or advice, I just needed to get this off my shoulders.", "subreddit": "lonely"}

Often I meet new people related to my company but my daily work is at home alone with my brother that works with me. This started 2 and half years ago.\n\nI dropped my job at an advertising agency where I never had a real good friend, just job colleagues. So I don't miss that. My real friends where made in elementary school, high school and college. My friends from the time I was a kid are there, I can call them. But they are all with new friend's, and it's not like I would feel comfortable to say \"hey, dude, im lonely and I have nobody\". They actually don't know that, they probably think I'm going fine just like them. These are the real and deep friends I had.\n\nI never made any friends on High School and I think this time was when my social phobia began. Everyone there where just stupid for me and treated me like I was a weirdo just because I was new. I just said fuck them and lived 2 years pretending it was ok. No one knew that too. Not even my parents.\n\nAt college I had maybe the best time of my life. I had a girlfriend she was hot, I was always at parties, I started smoking weed and that helped me a lot on hanging around with people. When I broke up I met some other girls, but never had a second long term relationship. \n\nWell, after a while I saw that almost 90% of my college friends where superficial friendship that depended all on smoking weed. 3 years ago o had drop it because it was fucking me up with anxiety and paranoia. Also, I began using other drugs wich I was never addicted, but I was on the path to it. So I decided to change my life and don't do any drugs anymore. Consequently my \"friends\" started losing their interest on me and i lost my interest on them either. \n\nSo I decided to make money and do what I loved, Wich is graphic design.

But she said in the last minute she would not go because had a personal problem. I know we are not going to chat anymore as we did in the last 3 weeks.

I remember in my high school gym class a group of girls kind of accepted me into their little clique. I had trouble communicating with them because of the pain. But it made me feel human. I am attracted (and relate exclusively) to women and I haven't spoken to a gal my age since junior year. So approximately 2.5 years ago. It's rather lonely. It does kind of make me a little crazy. I have absolutely zero interest in dating... I just want to speak to a girl my age. I think about it often now.\n\nI have never really had anyone that I can speak to about personal stuff before. I read stories online about people having friendships and I become so jealous. Makes me pretty upset honestly. Years ago when I was still in middle school I used to play video games online with my best friend Christian. He was really emotionally distant but I still cared about him a lot. I still do. Junior year he told me I was really depressing recently. He told me that he couldn't be around me if I kept acting like I was. At the time I lacked the perspective to really see how I was acting. So that was kind of the end of socializing for me. I said goodbye to him and haven't spoke to him since. He made it obvious that he wanted to speak to me senior year. Actually, many people did. I accepted that I just couldn't communicate with people anymore. All of senior year I never said a word.\n\nI look on Facebook and see all of those people.

If you are taught to hate yourself by bullies constantly for multiple years, and didn't have any friend or relationships to cause you to be able to ignore them, you are slowly going to start to believe them. If you are taught by being rejected and getting that eww look that you're ugly without any success to balance it out, you will begin to believe them.\n\nWe can't change our mindset and believe it. Sure, we can say I am great 50 times a day in the shower because FA'ers don't shower, it doesn't mean we will actually believe that because the evidence says different.

If you\u2019ve missed out on learning to \u2018act human\u2019, acquiring it post-25 is a Sisyphean task. *\n\nApologies for the length. By way of introduction, I\u2019m 26 and I\u2019ve lurked on ForeverAlone for a few years past. Although I agreed with many of the experiences described by some of the more regular posters, until recently I still maintained the delusion that somehow I could drag myself out of my hole. I suppose I am now a failed normie instead of FA, but nevertheless I\u2019d like to share my story.\n\nThrough my high school and university years, I had no romantic or sexual experience: largely due to melancholy, fear of others and being grotesquely underweight. This all overwhelmed me when I was 20 or so, and I struggled with alcohol and motivation to live. I changed with my ways and ended up doing well in my academic field, until I moved overseas on a scholarship and succumbed to performance anxiety and homesickness. My dedication to my field, something that had been my emotional crutch for years, was no more.\n\nLast year after I returned (aged 25) I attended a small gathering and met the woman who would become my girlfriend. We would be together for six months. She was everything I could ever want in a partner, even to the point of being a peer in my study field. Let me say, never listen to people who say that having an emotional bond is meaningless. It was an incredible boost to my life; it inspired me in my painful task of seeking work and motivated me to eat healthier and do my exercise. I wanted to be the best version of myself for her. I helped her with her thesis and attended any seminar at which she spoke. I bought her books related to her topic. One of my dearest wishes was to watch her walk across the stage and be awarded her doctorate. Being starved of human companionship for so long, I savoured the simple things. She was also the first woman with whom I was physically intimate in all forms. I confessed to her that I struggled with physical and emotional intimacy, but she seemed to accept it. This sequence of events was all a huge shock to my system. Suddenly it appeared that meme advice actually worked; just work hard, wait, and good things will happen to you. The ease with which I could communicate with her suggested my fears of missing out in my youth (something I\u2019m sure many readers here share) were groundless. I was simply a late bloomer, and now I had a connection, I would grow as a human being. Being alone for years, I had simple hopes for our bond. I wanted somebody with whom I could discuss literature, watch foreign films, and cook interesting meals with. Savouring the simple things regular people so take for granted.\n\nJanuary this year, we broke up. It was totally out of the blue, and it shattered me; right until the break-up text she was \u2018excited to see me\u2019. Early in our courtship, she told me that she was bisexual, and I accepted this about her. This was her reason for breaking up with me: that I was the wrong gender, along with claims that I was emotionally unavailable. She had never told me that I was distant or uncommunicative, and I\u2019d known I would\u2019ve done my best to improve; I was oblivious due to my inexperience. She also stated that if I felt wronged by her thoughts, she would walk away and never see me again. Being the only new human connection I had made in half a decade, I caved. Although I was devastated, I did not feel it was right to tie her to me and despite the shedding of many tears on my part (none on hers), I let her go so she could follow her innermost feelings.\n\nYesterday, I discovered that she has been seeing a man after all, and is going on a holiday with him. The main reason she had for breaking up with me, the fact that I was not a woman, was totally false. I let her go because I believed in her bisexuality, and I loved her so much that I wanted to see her happy. I had hoped we could remain friends. If I had known she was in two minds, I would have fought so much harder to keep her. She witnessed me break down in front of her, and yet it made no impression. I feel sickened that a person I poured my most intimate thoughts out to could deceive me in such a fashion. And I was foolish and pathetic enough to simply believe whatever she said. I so craved human connection that I blinded myself and swallowed and this revelation (my inability to read other human beings) has rattled me to my core.\n\nThe point of this bloated text is this: the most deceptive thing about normie advice that I\u2019ve found is how much it can be based in reality. In my case, it really did happen by chance, as normies love to say. I do not say this as a means of comfort \u2013 in fact, I find it grossly unfair someone like me got a connection when I hadn\u2019t taken any steps of improvement until I was in a relationship, while there are people in this subreddit who have put in true effort and got nothing back. And secondly, it really was all about personality. Again this is no comfort; if you are emotionally stunted due to isolation or social anxiety, there is no breathing to develop a semblance of normality. I don\u2019t want to invalidate the suffering of those who have never experienced human connection. All I want to say is that sometimes it really is too late, and perhaps the devil you know really is better. By your mid to late twenties, you are expected to know how to be a human being, and there is no goodwill is you make even a single misstep. I am unable to read people, or trust their statements. It is not better to have loved and lost. The only thing that has changed about me through \u2018late blooming\u2019 is that all of my illusions about my confidence, personal growth and my dream of a partner/family/normal life have been definitely crushed.", "subreddit": "ForeverAlone"}

I'm an introvert, I don't like talking that is not interesting for me. I don't like having more friends because I treasure the quality of friendship, not the quantity. In high school, I discovered myself that I am good at drawing/making art. So when there had an art project/drawing, they're went to make them an art. I feel that I am used to have their grades. And every time that has a major event (like NBA Finals and a movie release, particular the Marvel ones), they talked about it, and no one wanted to talk to me because I'm not interested at it.\n\nIn college, I discovered (again) that I am good at video editing/photography/graphic design. So, when the project comes, they choose me as a member of their group, sometimes a leader. I feel that I'm used again 'coz after the project finishes, no one wanted to make friends with me.\n\nOne time, I had a crush on my classmate, and I'm happy that I make friends with her. But after 2 months, she is very cold to me. I've just found out that her friends influence her. They make sure that we will not be together. Also, they sent me very long messages on facebook citing that there are many reasons why should we go in a relationship. I was really upset 'coz I built a good relationship with the girl and because of her friends' influence, it pop like a bubble.\n\nThey graduated on time, and I'm still here at university. I deleted all of my social media accounts for not being jealous on their success.\u00a0 It makes me toxic. And now, my family is questioning me when do I have a romantic relationship? What's my plan? Do I still have friends? What job do I take? I feel pressured, and depressed. Every night, I can't sleep because of overthinking. *\"Why are the bullies is more successful than me?\"* I cried a lot every time I remember my past. I experience more mental breakdowns than before.

Sometimes they are youngsters (below 16) who haven't had sex and because of social pressure, they think they are weird and they believe that there is something wrong with them. This, however, can be true, since some of them \"evolve\" to the next tier.\n\n**Tier One: the odd one out**\n\nThese people simply lack a significant other. They have a decent amount of friends, but they will never have intimacy with the other (or same, I don't judge) sex. Often an introvert who has been adopted by a group of extroverts. They are not fully Forever Alone, but can still feel down from time to time, this can change to depression when their close circle of friends starts getting married and having kids.\n\nThis depression, and probably other mental illnesses, combined with the fact that adult life tends to separate people and that fact that making friends post-university is really hard, can lead to an \"upgrade\" to tier two.\n\n**Tier Two: the loner**\n\nOnly known by their close family members, barely remembered by his/her school mates. Always \"that guy\". Does not understand basic human interaction a.k.a. \"socially disabled\".\n\nTook the black pill early in life since the other sex always treated him/her as a hideous goblin, or didn't acknowledge his/her existence at best. \n\nOnce the family starts dying of natural causes, it will inevitably lead to tier three.\n\n**Tier Three: the ghost**\n\nThis is as far as one can go in terms of being a social outcast.

I just had to establish myself as a key member of the class by engaging in class discussion, laughing along with whatever jokes were told, talking to people next to me and marking comments.

So I am just trying to get all this off my chest since I don't have anyone to talk to about this.\n\nI cannot say that I am experiencing full on depression as I don't really know how that feels and i feel like I can still function normally right now. So i would call it mild occasional depression. When I was in primary school I had a normal amount of friends with who I would hang at at school and at each others place a lot of the time. My best friend at the time with which I spent a ridiculous amount of time together joined a high school quite far away so we very rarely saw each other, at first only on the weekends and later he wouldn't even come back home for months. After joining high school I started smoking (only cigarettes at first and later also pot) and that's also how I met a lot of people both in high school (in the capital) and in my home town. However 95%+ of my friends were also smokers. I still consider that as the most fun times I have ever had in my life. As my best friend was absent for most of the time I got 2 new best friends, 1 from high school and 1 from my hometown. I was also in a relationship with a girl which didn't last for very long. But because I was an undisciplined and lazy student I failed my second year and had to redo it again in the following year. Because of that I stopped hanging out with quite a few friends from school as they weren't on the same schedule, I did however meet a small handful of friends (like 3) in my new class. After failing a school year I decided my smoking habits were really unhealthy for me and my education, so I decided to slowly wind it down. In the following 2 years I stopped completely and that is when I lost a majority of my friends. I used to be in a large group of friends from my hometown but after I stopped smoking it was like they didn't see me as one of their own, stopped calling me to hang out and didn't even want to meet up if I tried to initiate (and I tried a lot). That's when I realized these people weren't even really my friends (even my hometown best friend drifted away). I had quite severe anxiety and mild depression which led me to hate my school and to me failing it once again. So I had to go to afternoon classes at another school to finish the last year of high school. I didn't meet anyone there as it wasn't really a normal school environment. However I did meet one person through a very popular online game, this person was very understanding and willing to help with my problems so this person took over the role of my best friend (one of my previous bf's drifted away and the other two had school/job a long distance away from me). I would go out with friends but night life was never really my thing so I very rarely met new people and if I did it was just an acquaintance and not a friend. I decided I would give college a try as I heard its a very good place to meet new people and work on your career path at the same time. After 1 year the online friend seemingly wanted to have a change in life which didn't really include me and therefor we drifted apart). The first day of college I met a guy who I recognized from my hometown so we hit it off going to classes and getting food together at the start. At this time it was obvious people weren't really acquainted and were still forming groups within the large class (60 people). So one time I meet up with this guy after a class to get some food and there's another guy with him. Quickly I realized this guy was very anti-social and wouldn't really fit into a normal friends group (he would loudly burp during the lecture and loudly express his strange thoughts during lectures and a handful of others things that just made him very strange and awkward..) I knew that if I hanged out with this guy no one would want to talk to me, thinking I am an awkward person too. But of course this guy thought we were best buddies just because we had a coffee one time during a break. So he would follow me and the other guy literally anywhere we went so it was impossible for us to talk to other people because they would see him and just not want to associate themselves with me or the other normal guy because we kept getting followed by this awkward guy which was making every conversation into a mess. This is when I started going to the Gym which really helped me with keeping my anxiety levels at bay. However because of the inability to meet new people I started to have periods of sadness. I started thinking about how I don't want to keep studying for another 3 years when I know no one at college. I stopped attending and decided to get a job. I now work at a job which I like a lot but I am by far the youngest employee the others all being 10+years older. So there is really no way I could meet someone at work with which I could grab a drink or anything like that. So now I have less than 10 friends with which I could go out and have a normal chat and even out of these few none of them ever want to do anything exciting such as go on a hike or go to new places, do activities. Mostly I only meet them to grab a drink and talk. I always felt like people liked me as a person when I got closer to them and especially 1 on 1 I think I am a really fun person to hang out with. I used to be excited when my birthday was coming up as I could have fun with all my friends, nowadays I wish I didn't have a birthday because i have almost no one to celebrate it with. Even my first ever best friend didn't wish me happy birthday for 2 years in a row now... Even tho on the same day we were getting a drink and he always memorized it because its a very easy date. I don't think I have any true friends, all the people I used to spend a lot of time with are either abroad or I can never get in touch with. Finding a partner feels more difficult than ever and if it weren't for my hobbies of cooking, going to the Gym and playing video games I don't know what i would even do with my lonely life.\n\nThis is where I am at now. I don't know if anyone will even read this or reply.\n\nBut if you do, I would like to ask you, what do you think about my situation after reading all this, have you ever been in a similar situation as I am in now? Did time heal your loneliness or did u just have to accept this is what life is going to be, going forward?\n\nSometimes I think I am just unlucky, and sometimes I feel like I did this to myself.", "subreddit": "lonely"}

Only 2 other kids that I went to high school with are at this school. Ones a guy and the other is a girl. The guy and I are roommates. We weren\u2019t like best friends in high school and we only hung out once before going to college but he\u2019s a good dude and a decent roommate. We pretty much do everything together because we can\u2019t find friends. I mean it\u2019s fine and better than having a roommate that just ditches me but it\u2019s a different kind of loneliness. We\u2019ve hung out with some kids that we met in our building a few times but the other day they kicked us out for no reason. \n\nWe went and bought beer for them (they paid us for it we did not cover the cost of beer lol) and some stuff for us because we thought that maybe we\u2019d hang out but they kinda kicked us out. We had gone to a few sporting events around the school with them and explored the school really late at night the first time we hung out which was super fun. I just always sort of felt like I was tagging a long and not really invited though. But finally they decided to ditch us the other night. It might\u2019ve been only the one kid that kicked us out of their room cause the other two seemed like they had wanted to hang out because I had been texting them. But we found some girls in our building too that wanted some alcohol so we thought that maybe we could make friends with them by helping out.\n\nWe got money from them and got them a lot of stuff and we tried to ask if they wanted to hang out with us since we also had stuff. They said they\u2019d text us later and they never did. So we just ended up going to a bar. It was pretty fun but it was just me and my roommate. We ran into a couple of guys we knew but the one guy\u2019s roommate was too messed up and he had to take him home and the other was meeting up with a girl so they left us after about 20 minutes. I thought the one girl we had bought alcohol for seemed super interesting so I snapped her the next day asking if she wanted to meet up at our dorm later to hit a cart or something. She said she\u2019d see and didn\u2019t really text me back until much later. She said she wanted to come through and asked if her roommates could. I was happy because we literally haven\u2019t had anyone over in our dorm yet because we\u2019ve kinda been out doing stuff and our floor isn\u2019t very friendly. Doors are always closed and some of the guys are kinda dicks. But the girls basically stopped in for 15 minutes talked a little bit and got high and went to go out with some other people. But when they were over I said that we had met like a good amount of people but it was still kinda lonely. And the girl and her roommate agreed. Idk\n\nBasically it feels like people are only hanging with us when they want something we have. And then the second they get it they just act like we don\u2019t exist. \n\nFor the first few days we couldn\u2019t really reach the girl who we went to high school with but she\u2019s always been bad with texting back and she\u2019s rushing for a sorority so she\u2019s been busy. But we finally bumped into her and we hung out the whole day. It seems like she knows a bunch of dudes and she\u2019s met people through her sorority thing. It was fun and it actually felt like we were with people who wanted to hang out with us but we haven\u2019t really been able to reach her or meet up since. I think she\u2019s almost done with the rushing process but I\u2019m worried that she\u2019ll probably not talk to us once she gets into a sorority because I\u2019ve heard that they only really talk to frat guys and stuff. And it\u2019s not like we\u2019re trying to get with her or anything we just want people to hang out with.\n\nPart of the issue is that there\u2019s nothing going on right now. We don\u2019t have any sort of clubs or anything until next week. I think I\u2019ll definitely rush a fraternity and join clubs because it just sucks so much being alone. I had a really good relationship with my family and a good sized but really tight knit group of friends from high school who i could always count on to be there to do stuff with. It seems like everyone is finding groups to do stuff with or having people over here. I thought college would be like a good place to meet a girl or something and have a lot of different and interesting friends. I mean any sort of way to have more contact with people would be nice at this point and I\u2019m not just upset about not meeting any girls. And I get that I\u2019m not instantly gonna find my crowd in the first week and have replacements for kids that I\u2019ve been friends with for years. It just sucks because like I said me and my roommate aren\u2019t like best friends and we\u2019re not super similar. We both like parties and stuff but I\u2019d say I\u2019m more outgoing and I like to explore more (like go on long walks and stuff) than he does. \n\nI just miss having a crowd to go do stupid stuff with or just walk around outside and know that they wanted me to be there without having to have something that benefited them. I just feel constantly used and that everyone I meet won\u2019t talked to me unless I can do something for them. I like helping out and making sure people have a good time but I usually only get runs and stuff if I\u2019m going to be there too. If anyone has any advice or anything I\u2019d appreciate it. Sorry if I sound like a douche during any part of this I didn\u2019t mean to.", "subreddit": "lonely"}

I didn't see that coming...", "author": "hamstrman", "self_text": "So I find myself in an interesting limbo of sorts recently. Tl;dr at bottom. \n\nThe last of my friends had a baby last year and I'm officially alone. I'd known them for almost 15 years now and, one by one, they dropped off the face of the earth. They were all from work, but because we shared an obscure profession that not many people choose to get into and even fewer succeed in, we were very close.\n\nYears later, everyone started getting married. I didn't. Then they started moving away, out of the city and into the suburbs. Some changed companies because of it. I didn't. Then came the babies... Long story short-ish, they all had babies and I've lost all my friends. I'm alone. \n\nSo here I am, on reddit, looking for a cuddle buddy, a partner, a relationship, someone to hang out with, whatever is desired of me. I'm almost 35 and I have no idea how to make friends as an adult, especially a female friend, outside of a group. \n\nI've never had sex. Never really had a relationship. I had on and off phases in school of having friends. And I always called myself an introvert. Other people go, \"Ehhh, not really.\" They describe me as an extrovert who's afraid. I have AvPD, after all. I instinctually make friends if we share interests and like talking to people. I just kind of... can't. And I like to be inside. \n\nSo the other day, I'm talking to someone online as a potential cuddle buddy, and she says, \"to be blunt,\" that I'm \"not nearly as maladjusted or dysfunctional\" as she is. We ended up stopping talking. I always felt like I didn't belong in normal society because of the mental illness, physical illness, bullying, and social stunting. \n\nBut now I find the mentally ill community telling me I'm too normal. I've kind of come through the other side, broken but still standing, I guess, so I make a great \"therapist,\" infinitely understanding and empathetic, but knowing how to deal. It both attracts and scares away others with mental illness who can't deal and are ashamed they're too fucked up and I \"deserve better.\" \n\nI feel like I belong nowhere and no one will have me. I have a cognitive dissonance of my negative self-perception and my known accomplishment. I'm told I'm a contradiction in conversation as I both degrade and defend myself. I don't want to be alone anymore, but almost no one even messages me. \n\nTl;dr - Friends all got married, had babies, and left. I'm alone, trying to make a female friend, and well-adjusted people tell me I'm too different minded (read: miserable) for normal socializing. Mentally ill people tell me I'm TOO well-adjusted to be able to socialize with them! What am I?? This is why I will be FA.", "subreddit": "ForeverAlone"}

I lost it at fifteen to a manipulative girl in HS who was two years older than me. And over the next five years I had several other sexual partners. So I cannot relate to never experiencing female intimacy. But this is for those that once had it but no longer do. \n\nI have gone over four and a half years without sex, holding hands, cuddling or much of anything with a woman. I was decently attractive before the I joined the Navy in 2015. But when I joined I also developed a horrible case of seborrheic dermatitis that lasted for three and a half years. This is a condition that can cause your skin to flare up and flake off. It gets crusty and painful. And the knee jerk reaction to pick at it makes it worse. While in training for two years I started relying on food to comfort me. Because I wasn't going out with friends. I was too busy hiding in my room outside of class so that people wouldn't see my face. I went from being an avid runner of 165 pounds at 5'11\" to being a sedentary piece of shit at 230 pounds. I stopped working out. The sweat made my face worse. I stopped playing the Mandolin, writing, learning languages, reading fiction. Everything that composed my identity started to disintegrate. My face and my weight consumed me. \n\nI took on playing video games instead. I never really played games before the Navy. Before I was a normie with some eclectic hobbies and interests. But at this point I essentially lived like a NEET except I had a job. There is something comfortable about being physically undesirable. You don't have to blame yourself for your lack of love and friendship. \n\nEventually I make it to my submarine. I still have the condition. I am still very overweight. I am no longer the cocky and self assured guy I was three years ago. I am a nervous and timid shadow of a human being. The hours are long. I made excuses as to why I cannot improve myself. For two years I was on the boat going through the motions. I almost died in a car wreck before the Navy, so driving has always mortified me. I am deeply afraid of cars, so I never got my license. This has only added to the isolation. \n\nEarly this year my skin started to get better. I am not sure why. I thought I was cursed to live out the remainder of my life a monster. Once it went away I thought I had no excuse to be the way I was. I started fasting every day. No more dinner. No more processed foods. No more artificial sugar. Over the course of two months I lost around forty five pounds of fat. I am at a normal weight now. I started dressing better. Nice shirts that fit my body. Skinny jeans that cling to my body. Good shoes. I abandoned the cargo pants and band t-shirts. And people have taken notice. \n\nBut ultimately nothing has changed. I am still incredibly lonely. I still have not made it anywhere with a woman. Before I had a crutch to justify my current state. I was fat and had poor hygiene. But now I looked good. Why hasn't anything changed? I think the years of abuse at the hands of others, dealing with body dysmorphia and a peeling, nightmare inducing face has made me into something I can't come back from no matter how attractive I am. \n\nThere is something inherently lonely about being in the Military. Maybe inherently something about being lonely on a submarine like myself, or on a ship. You are always surrounded by people, but they are empty faces. Bags of meat. A cook on board tried to kill himself a few weeks ago, and he is gone now. The Captain brushed it under the table and didn't tell the crew about it. We had to find out ourselves. There is something about the cold and callous routine of daily living. Of daily maintaining. Maintaining your addictions so you can make it to the next day. Smoke that cigarette. Down that beer. Crush that energy drink. Slam that cup of coffee. Watch another youtube video. Feign interest in the small talk of a passerby on an elevator. Occasionally call back home. Talk about how good you are. Don't admit that you are staring down the black hole every day of your fucking life. Because you don't want them to worry. And you don't want them to know that they are the only reason you haven't placed your 9mm to your temple and ended it all during midwatch. \n\nMaybe I am not FA. Not a real FA.

Even when I do put in the effort, it\u2019s not always acknowledged.  This past weekend I organized a surprise get together for my boyfriend\u2019s birthday (his birthday was last weekend, but he had to work all weekend, so I scheduled for this weekend since he is off) - invited close to 40 people, some of who were his high school friends that he still talks to, some of his coworkers, but mostly mutual friends (friends we met through playing hockey together).  ONE person showed up for the surprise part (his best friend), one person showed up an hour or so into it, then one person and his gf showed up like 3 hours later.  I felt HORRIBLE for such a terribly low turnout.  Luckily, my boyfriend is super cynical and jaded as well, and was actually glad not many people showed up.  As he put it, \u201cif anyone had invited me to something like this, I wouldn\u2019t have gone and wouldn\u2019t have felt bad about it.  I can\u2019t really expect people to go out of their way for me.\u201d  He took the disappointment way better than I did. He was still very appreciative of my effort, though.  \n\nAnd then my former roommate, who also got me a very good job at her company and is my boss, had a gender reveal party today and my boyfriend and I weren\u2019t invited - we play hockey and are \u201cfriends\u201d with most of the people who were there, so it wasn\u2019t like it was family-only or wouldn\u2019t have known anyone there.  That was a second kick to the hoo-hah that I really wasn\u2019t mentally prepared for.  \n\nI work from home full-time - there are stretches of days where I have zero interaction with another human being, both in person and virtually.  If it wasn\u2019t for my boyfriend and his family, I\u2019ll probably be a complete shut-in.  Honestly, it doesn\u2019t even matter if I put in the effort to spend time with friends - any time I try to make plans or organize something with friends, no one is interested (like my boyfriend\u2019s birthday party).  I\u2019m not a bad person - I\u2019m just quiet.  It\u2019s tough to explain, but I don\u2019t have that \u201cringleader\u201d type of personality.  I\u2019m not the life of the party.  It\u2019s honestly like I don\u2019t exist to other people sometimes.  I can\u2019t tell if it\u2019s because I\u2019m quiet and shy or for some other reason. \n\nNeedless to say, I am re-evaluating my social circle (for like the 10th time in my life).  I meet people, talk to and spend some time with them, then the second I stop putting in the effort, all interactions with them stop.  This is the cycle - it literally has to be me that is the issue because this happens so damn frequently.  I hate relying on my boyfriend for all my social interaction, but frankly, people just suck.  I\u2019ve turned to Reddit lately and have been commenting and giving people advice on various subs - it at least makes me feel like I\u2019m being useful to SOMEBODY, even if it a random stranger on the internet.  Even my family sucks - my mom and sister are vampent narcissists (the main reason why I struggle with anxiety and depression so much as an adult) and try to avoid them as much as possible.  My dad is great, but always busy with his social engagements with my stepmom.  Just wish I could find people who can relate to me, understand me and are willing to pull their own weight in the friendship.", "subreddit": "lonely"}

For the last several years it's either been me needing to defend myself from physical attacks or the gloved hands of doctors and nurses for physicals or to draw blood.\n\nMy teenage years was spent in a collapse as I went to a technical high school despite wanting to pursue art, being yelled at and hit by my parents for not doing well enough, losing all the friends I ever had, being heartbroken over my first girlfriend, and being exploited by mental health professionals that were more interested in their own agendas than helping me.\n\nI've spent the last 7ish years shut inside my family's apartment, barely going outside for months at a time, not having or knowing fundamental adult life skills like how to get a job or what I need to do to get a bank account or a cellphone because growing up I was told to focus on schoolwork if I wanted a good job until I fell apart and communication with my parents broke down. The apartment we live in has become more and more of a bug-infested mess, my parents having a hoarding problem and refusing to throw things out or help clean up, telling me to just leave if I hated our living situation so much. Things are only peaceful if I behave complacently.\n\nI've become incredibly weak and underweight. I struggle to breathe when waking up, feeling a buildup of mucus and dust in my nostrils every day that needs cleaning out. Some days I just don't leave my bed because I just want to close my eyes and pretend not to exist. My teeth are yellow from years of not taking enough care of them and they won't whiten no matter how much I brush these days. My social skills are also completely gone.\n\nOnce upon a time, I used to love to draw, it was a core part of my identity, but these last few years I've become unable to. Whenever I have a pencil and a blank sheet of paper nearby, there's nothing I can do.\n\nI've gone through a couple long term, long distance relationships the last couple years that have all gradually dampened my views on people, women, trust, and love, until I finally closed my heart for good two years ago.\n\nI only really have two friends and one social group, all entirely online. The social group consists of some tough-guy personalities that I usually only enjoy being around 20% of the time. The two friends I have usually don't have me high on their priorities and often forget to write back to me, sometimes weeks at a time.\n\nI know right now, I should be focusing on improving my physical health while figuring out how to establish some of the fundamental life stuff. But I've spent the last couple weeks in my bed wondering what the point is. If I do get my life back up and running, I'll still be all alone. And if I'm not all alone, the anxiety of knowing just how easily everything can collapse and disappear will always be there.\n\nI hate my birthdays, nothing good ever happens and I always wish I were never brought into this world. I keep wondering how long this can go on, if I could just disappear...\n\nI wish a nice lady could hold me and tell me that things would be alright. But I know I'm not good enough for something like that and even if I were, I'd be too afraid to feel comfort or affection again.\n\nI don't know why I typed all of this.

I know this is my fault, but that doesn\u2019t mean these things can be corrected so easily.\n\nI am at college now and I\u2019m rooming with someone from my high school that I\u2019m friends with.

I guess this means I\u2019m less lonely than most people on this sub, but having people here (not a lot and only one that I\u2019d say I\u2019m pretty close with) doesn\u2019t really make me feel any less lonely than when at home. I feel like I am just constantly given a test by everyone and every social interaction is crucial leading me to stray from any interaction altogether. \n\nI lay in my apartment all day feeling like a failure in every meaning of the word. My mom told me before I left that she just wants me to be happy and that she wants this to be a new step in my life and I feel like I\u2019ve failed at it already, not just this step but my entire existence in general feels like a failure and each day paves this flat road of failure onward into even worse times.  I feel like my step dad just sees me as some worthless child who\u2019s failed. He has never said anything like this but I don\u2019t know, I just get the feeling that I\u2019m not worthy sometimes.\n\nLast year I didn\u2019t join any clubs, I walked up to a club meeting and peaked at it and saw so many people so I just chickened out and left. This year I promised myself to join something, my roommate said \u201cin college you join things\u201d but I looked and there is nothing and with every somewhat decent looking club I just think about what type of people are in that club and how they will perceive me, always negatively \n\nI feel this cycle is so easy to break but I can\u2019t.

Since they\u2019ve left it\u2019s so different because I used to be running all over the place all of the time to go places and do things, but now they\u2019re all hundreds of miles away and I\u2019m stuck by myself.

I just couldn't believe it so I accepted to go out with her and some friends and I eventually got a date that ended with a kiss. I had sex with her on the next date. The sex sucked but this was the best moment in my life. When I texted her on the next day she told me that it would never happen again. She lied to her friend saying that I almost forced her. It isn't true, otherwise this post wouldn't obviously exist. I even asked her if everything was ok because she felt embaressed to me. I understood that she did all of this out of compassion. My world shattered. What I really wanted was a bit of recognition from some female being(and I did like her) and I got the exact opposite. I felt worse than before. I didn't really ever have self-confidence but I felt like an earth worm. As of today I don't still know if this event was good or bad. The only sure thing is that if I will ever have another opportunity(not really likely if you ask me) I will think two times before risking something like this.", "subreddit": "ForeverAlone"}

A little over 24 hours go I met someone and felt a pretty instant connection.  In our first conversations we quickly noticed that we had a lot o similar life experiences and quirky views on things.  We opened up and shared stuff and it felt good.  I can truly say I did not have an agenda other than to get to know her better.  Yes I found her attractive but I wasn't necessarily looking for a romantic relationship I just wanted to get to know her better and see what happened.  If we had landed on being friends that just had cool conversations because of the connection it truly would have been amazing because I am so fucking lonely and just having someone to talk to like that would have been pretty life changing.\n\nThe crazy thing is she felt it too.  All of the same connections.  It was a strong feeling for both of us but where I saw possibility she saw vulnerability. The connection scared her and she cut it off.  Even in our conversation about it I felt a connection, she said so many things that were fascinating and I really wanted to explore the feelings and experiences she was alluding too. She said the fact that I understood her fear and didn't try to change her feelings made her feel like we had even more of a connection and that scared her even more.  I didn't want to tray to talk her into anything that wasn't good for her so I made it easy for her to say goodbye by telling her I understood her feelings even if I didn't agree with them and telling her I would totally respect her decision and not try to reach back out.\n\nIt sucks!  I know it's not about me that it's about her and where she is at emotionally but still this really hurts.  Of course I feel rejected and hurt.  It isn't like we got far so I am not distraught or anything like that but I am sad.

{"post_id": "cvleeg", "created_utc": 1566809375, "title": "Story of My Life", "author": "Boopity_Snoopins", "self_text": "Hey. Not feeling too great right now. Been doing a lot of excessive introspection to the point where my rooms filled with early morning light and i haven't slept, so could do with just getting some stuff out there. Might be a Tl;dr at the bottom, this is gonna be long. Posting to both r/vent and r/lonely because idk where this should really go to be honest.\n\nI was born in 96 and lived in a decent wee neighbourhood for my early years. About a dozen or so homes looked inwards to a central square car park. I had a few good friends on the street and there was no conflict or animosity between the kids there. We had all been brought up together to the point where we could practically wander into each others houses u invited Anne be welcome with open arms. The memories i have are all wonderful ones.\n\nI was brought up by my mother and the dad of my younger sister. She is five years younger than me. At the time i occassionally went to see my dad but after i was returned home with a hand mark across my face after being under the care of his girlfriend, my mum declared that he would other see me without her present or not see me, and so he fucked off.\n\nAt school i had a good amount of friends I played with, and was generally happy. I was good at my classwork and surprised my teachers with my ability to read and write more fluently than expected of someone my age (there was a TV show i used to watch that was literally just a floating pencil going through the alphabet and words for each letter that I used to sit down and watch with some crayons and paper. I still vaguely remember the chalkboard animations but nothing else).\n\nEven this dearly on though, looking back i can see that i was a bit different. Not in a good way, mind you, i just seemed to be unable (or at least have difficulty) to see the perspectives of other people. These days i know i have the social aspects associated with autism, as told by my current psychologist (more on that later). It started go cause problems around the half way mark of primary school.\n\nWhen my sister begin to outgrow being in the cot/sleeping in the same room with mum (i would have been around 7 or 8) we had to move house. We moved into a much rougher neighbourhood. I had no friends on the area since it was the area of a different primary school. I still went to my previous one though, as mum didn't want to move me away from my friends and it was only a twenty minute walk away. I made a couple of friends in the area but they were very different from the ones i knew previously, who I didn't see as much anymore.\n\nThe place I was in was not a sheltered community, but it may as well have been compared to this place. The kids were rough and i didn't fit in very well, but was generally liked. However, it didn't take long for a group of kids to decide they didn't like me and shit started to go downhill. If I was with my friends everything was fine since everyone knew each other, but otherwise I was scared to walk around.\n\nAt around the time when I was entering primary 3/4 - a split class of both year groups, i began to be bullied quite heavily outside and inside school. Outside school, i had lost contact with some of my friends on the area due to the group of kids that didn't like me saying stuff about me. I remember arguing with one kid who was determined i had been saying things about him. I didn't go outside much after this as I didn't play with anyone and whenever I played outside by myself something would happen involving these kids. Didn't help that i lived amongst them - one was next door, another just around the corner, another down the other end of the street and another over the back garden fence. Even in my back garden i would get shouted at by kids who would scale the high fence to hurl insults. By this time i hadn't spoken to anyone from my original home in quite a while. I think mum didn't speak to the parents too often and I had these current issues on my mind so I just forgot about them to be honest.\n\nInside school, I was being bullied by a pair of primary 7 boys. Now i was a little, frail ginger fuck who wasn't exactly the best at confrontation, but when in aw these kids stuffing random jackets and bags from the cloakroom into bins and hiding them and throwing them around for no reason during out break time, i went and got the teacher, who had me go with her and she practically pointed at me and went \"Boopity here seen you two do this.\" And they had to clean it up.and put everything back. Worth noting that the only toilet for boys above p3 is accessible only from this cloakroom (notebthata the cloakroom wasn't a room let say, it was three walls with a double door sized opening rather than having a closable door.\n\nThey Megan o wait for me during breaks and lunch time and would trap me within the cloakroom. I would go for the toilet, walk out and they would be standing in the opening and not let me out. They would punch and kick me unless I did some incredibly degrading shit. Since i was the cause of them having to clean the cloakroom they made me \"clean\" it by crawling around on my hands and knees wiping the floor with my hands whilst they point, laugh and occassional throw things at me, and if i stopped or protested they would hurt me.\n\nThis went on for a while before mum found out due to the bruises and some of my stuff going missing. During that time not one of my friends had questioned where i was, and not one of the kids walking by the cloakroom to the only toilet, or up the stairs visible from the cloakroom (the only stairs the boys could go up to reach the classrooms as the first floor was mostly storage) had said a thing. Several classmates had walked by bit didnt even eem to notice.\n\nNow these days i know that kids aren't exactly the most perceptive of this kind of thing. A lot of things go by unnoticed as they're too busy doing their own thing to really care. Not out of maliciousness, just childish tunnel vision of \"I need to be outside playing asap\", but this hurt me deeply that people I spoke with often didn't seem to notice or care. I became more and more distant with friends who began to become angry since i was never around anymore. I didn't tell them out right what was happening because it was humiliating and shameful.\n\nWhen mum found out she went straight to the school. They said they would keep an eye out for any such activities. Nothing changed. After a while mum went back in after the newly replaced jacket i had been given went missing. In fact it never went missing, i could just never pluck up the courage to tell her if had been stuffed into a urinal and pisses all over. Onyhoo, the school.said they would have teachers check in often to ensure it wasnt happening anymore, and advised that i stay out of the cloakroom, as it was just allowing the bullies to repeat their actions. Keep in mind this is the way to access the only bathroom i could use during break time.\n\nThey didn't really look into the cloakrooms too often. It went on as normal with an occassional.teacher coming in. The.teacher that did this saw me standing in the centre if the cloak room once, with the two boys casually standing by the cloakroom entrance, but just left after seeing nothing was happening at that moment. She came in a second time to me on my hands and knees scrubbing the floor, trousers and hands black with mud and shit, and she simply shooed the bullies out of the cloakroom and told me to stop.being silly and to go wash my self off. This is probably one if the reasons why i stopped seeing teachers In a Positive light.\n\nSince they weren't helping me in any way i could see, i decided to stop going for the toilet so i could avoid the cloakroom. That meant i never ate or drank at school, which made the teachers angry during lunch, but they couldn't force me to eat. After lunch though, i would still need to pee quite often, so i used the excuse of having forgotten of having not needed to go earlier to get to go after lunch had ended and class had resumed. Eventually the teacher thought inwas taking the kiss though, and put a stop to that. One day i needed the toilet really badly and jt we about five minutes before the end of the day. I asked to go she said no, i put my hand up again and explained i was desperate, she got angry and said no again, and it ended up with me peeing myself not long after i had stepped out of the classroom into the end of school rush of students.\n\nMum of course stormed back into the school after taking me home. No idea what was said but once again nothing really changed. Mum tried desperately o get me to change school but wouldn't do it if I didn't want to. Considering how shitty things had gotten the last time locales were changed i was practically begging to remain there.\n\nDidn't take long for me break down crying in class though. The teacher then add me declare to the lass what was wrong with me. I should.mention that I didn't know the names of the boys or anything btw, So i couldn't point them out without he schools support. Onyhoo, i cried something along the lines of nobody likes me, and the teacher said that I was being ridiculous and made thale class give a show of hands of who liked me and who didn't. Of a class of about 22 around half raised their hands, but I didn't really believe any of them, even my friends - who i only occassionally got to play with. Probably the first genuinely cynical thought I can clearly remember to be honest. Infant remember when abouts it happened but one of my few closer friends witnessed me being bullied once tried to get me to just alknoast the boys who violently shoved me back into the cloakroom, so my friend went and got a teacher, who surprisingly, just shooed everyone back outside. Idk why i though this and don't know if it's true or nit, but it seemed to me like my friend was annoyed he had ro get involved. I distinctly remember him sighing as he left, and I thought he had just abandoned me to the pair of cunts.\n\nOnyhoo, i started to avoid going to school, my workrate and quality dropped sharply and then as my attendance hit rock bottom, with my mum going inconstantly to try and figure out a solution, the school phoned social work on my mum for being an unfit parent who allowed her child to avoid going to school. Mum explained fo the social workers who came what was going on but they must've not believed much. They straight uontold my mum that if she didn't hlget her act together they would be forced to fake serious actions to ensure that i am with a family who would ensure i get the education I deserve.\n\nSo mum, between a rock and a hard place, was forced tonresoubke her efforts to make me attend school. I wasn't cooperative since I obviously isn't realise how serious the issue was. However, i went often enough to realise he school had put in more effort. Of course shit started up again not long after the summer holidays, and according to mum that's because the social workers had left by then do the school had stopped putting in a show for them. Mums been quite forthright with me about the entire situation over the years. She hates both that school and the social work in general for the way they acted.\n\nThings didn't let up until that year of primary finished and the bullies moved on to high school. Up until this point I didn't actually know they were primary 7s, until they were on stage with the rest of their year for their shitty leaving assembly. By this point, I had been bullied enough inside and outside of school that my favourite pass time of playing computer games had become a major form of escapism for me. To this day it's still a hobby of mine, but back then it was an unhealthy obsession.\n\nAround then my dad came back and got me on the weekends. I was admittedly a spoiled brat that didn't have to do much around the house by this pint, as mum had coddled me since the bullying, but that all changed at dads house. I had to clean and take the bins out,.and by the end of primary school i had to cook for myself too. No.idea if it was his laziness or him trying to get me to be less of a spoiled shit, and although I hated him for if at the time, I'm grateful for it now.\n\nThe year after the bullies had left, I still let disconnected from my class and spent little time interacting with hem unless necessary. A girl.transferred into our class mid way through the year and ended up playing with our group of friends. To say i had an unhealthy attraction for her would be understatement. She treat me normally and was pretty cool, one of the smartest people i had met in that point in life sonwas great to talk to as well, but it was the fact that early in she shot down someone who tried to befriend her by saying nasty shit about someone she didn't get along with in class that made me gain said unhealthy attraction. She was a good friend of mine and we spend a lot of time arguing and bickering for that year. it was a good year.\n\nThe year after though i started to have serious motivation issues and just lost interest in a lot of things. Once again I stopped going to school as much and when i started going back frequent, the girl had moved to a different group of friends. We still spoke, but not as often. I had began do isolate nyzwkf from some friends and by the end of primary school there was only two i really spoke with. One i would never see again after primary school, the other followed me into the same secondary school.\n\nBy this time my dad had introduced me to the wondrous worlds of PC gaming, Warhammer 40K, reading fantasy novels (shoutout to trolltooth wars and the dragons of autumn twilight forgotten realms books) and the biggest one of all, Pen and paper rpg games. Specifically 2nd edition dungeons and dragons. I read a fucktonne of books (a lot of Terry Pratchet, Margaret Weiss, Tracy Hickman, and Trudi Canavan) and played a fuckfonne of tabletop/pen and paper games with my dads group of friends who I still speak with to this day.\n\nHigh school was hard. I had no motivation to do much, no idea what unwanted to do with myself, no self esteem, and seen the worst in people. To make matters worse the only thing people knew of me in the first year of high school was that i stank of stake cigarette smoke. My mum and her current BF (not the father of my sister, who had broken up around primary six I think) stayed up late in the living room where the clothes were drying, chain smoking fags.\n\nSo my music teachers idea of questioning me about his was to declare that I should just admit that I was a smoker in front of my entire class. This utter nugget was your stereotypical \"None of that new age nonsense, classical only\" arrogant musician who had to be correct all the time so he gave me detention for.lying to him when i argued that i had no idea what he was talking about (i didn't realise the smell because I was used to it, unfortunately. I can still remember a couple of students dry heaving when they were like 3 metre away once. That still stings a bit).\n\nSo the rumour that the quiet dude that never spoke was a smoker got around. As time passed it shifted into I was stoner. The.reason being that during the holidays of my second year of high school, I had a full blown meltdown in a bowling alley with my family in a nearby city. At some point I had managed to develop an anxiety disorder and it accumulated to a panic attack in absolutely heaving ten pin bowling/arcade building that could about a fucktonne of people in it, which it was doing. No idea when it started but my symptoms of anxiety must have been obvious to those round me because me being on god knows how many drugs became a rumour next. I would have been maybe 14 or 15 at the time btw.\n\nAround this time a dose who was pleasant to speak to pointed out the awesomeness of Xbox live. I didn't have internet at home and had no idea it was even possible to play with others online. So i got home and practically launched into an informsrcial and since it had been ages since i seemed that inferstsdx in anything mum went ahead rmand for it all and i ended up playing with this dude on good ol' modern warfare 2 and red dead redemption online. From there I found out he spoke tonseveeak classmates of mine aho were food friends and they were shocked to know i played Xbox and were exceptionally cool.aboit it all. They became good friend throughout high school, although it was still a struggle.\n\nMy attendance dropped and peaked quite a lot and my tardiness was notable to the teachers. They were understanding when they found out I was attempting to avoid the morning rush of people so aa to avoid any panic attacks, which were frequent enough to cause anxiety in and of themselves. There was a chemistry teacher who didn't see my anxiety as a real issue though and had a habit of making students stays up in front of class to answer problems or otherwise tonchastisebrhem if they've made mistakes. These days i see it as him.bringing attention to common pitfalls during experiments and the like, by using in class examples,.but it fucking terrified me at the time and so i avoided his class like the plague.\n\nThe Social work were involved again after my tardiness became a major issue in my third or fourth year. They were much more understanding this time since it was to do with my mental health. Mum still hates them though as apparently heybseen it as her fault I was in such a condition. The social worker took me out to play pool and stuff with a group of other kids, but the other kids were ones with properly difficult home lives, or so i would guess from their behaviour. They reminded me too much of the kids that were still bouncing around the streets outside my house - where i still spent all my time indoors. By this fine i literally had no friends in my local.area outside of those i spoke with online and the one dude from primary school.\n\nAt some point around here, intrude to kill myself. Depression wasn't something i had been diagnosed with, as i never really spoke about my feeling with people. Past events had made it seem like nobody really cares. I took a total of 37 assorted tablets and pills from the medicine drawer. Mum was on all kinds of pain medication and had a whole bunch of stuff sfored for different situations. I took then with. Bottle of water and lay in bed. The next day or so as utterly excrutiating. My body was unresponsive, and my heartbeat was slow, weak and painful. Every time it beat pain flared up and i couldn't think straight. The next couple of days i slowly recovered but thenoainnwas songreatbthat i will.never ever attempt that again. Of that I'm certain. Nobody noticed this though. Mum was run off her feet. She had just had her bird child and spent very little time in the house as her daughter wasnahtistic and she was running to all sorts of sermons, groups and medical meetings to fijd out as much s she could. (Fun fact, she now goes fo the same primary school I went to and is about as enthusiastic to go there as I was. kinda worried that something similar is happening)\n\nMoney became an issue for a while when the Xbox One first appeared, and the other kids i spoke to were either better off financially, or were their parents only children. As such, when everyone shifted to the affectionately named X-bone, i was left behind. By the time i rejoined then about 6 or so months later, the group had fallen apart. Only one of those lads and my mate from primary remained. The dude that introduced me to that group in the first place had fallen off the face of the earth a while back after both his parents succumbed to cancer and he moved away to live with his aunt - last I heard he unfortunately went off the deep end into some pretty hard drugs.\n\nSecondary school continued and eventually i found myself failing my highers and not having a backup plan, as i had been pretty messed up.for a while in a mentality of who gives a Fuxk hat haole s to me, i sure don't.\n\nI eventually pulled my finger out about a year after dropping out suddenly at the end of fifth year,and entered college to study IT. My pair of friends had left before me.and were a year ahead, so i woukd be foing into a class fully comprised of strangers. I waked to college with them.some mornings though, and theough them met anduse that became a good friend. Many a tike was spent on hisncouch playing fighting games and discussing politics and science. He was a stoner but i didn't care. In fact, after a while I was curious. I had been labelled a stoner for long enough - once had a dude threaten to kick the shot out of me if Indidnt stop.lying and just admit i was a low life stoner (Good times) - so any stigma around them was kinda hazy for me at best. I had known the dude for a while and seen him and a mate of his smoke enough times to realise irnsodnt alder heir personality in any scary ways drugs had been represented to me as doing back in school. In fact, they just seemed relaxed, happy and hungry af.\n\nThus i became that which i was labelled as. My mate was flooded when i took my first draw. One he dubbed as being \"The kind of draw he would.expect Snoop to take\". It fycking floored me. I had never smoked even a cigarette until that point so after a few minutes of coughing, i just sank into the couch and Kay there, playing DBZ, Tekken and Soulcalibur 4. I met many people through this dude. Met many faces that i would otherwise be terrified of through their appearance d ay of handling of themselves, all through the medium of weed. I don't smoke now, as I'm on several mexications for my mental health, but i don't regret it. If really helped me see that people i judged as being awful, egotistical and down right British, were sometimes really nice people who were just trying to get by like myself. Some ere utter cunts mind you, but that's people for you.\n\nI left college about half way through my third year as my mental health deteriorated sharply. A while later I looked into getting help and about half a year later I was introduced to a psychologist who i am still Seeing two years later. My only friends, primary dude, group lad and stoner boy, are all but abscent from my life. Primary has not been in touch for the better part if those two years. Stoner boy has been distant for a while since i moved in with my 96yo great grandmother around two and a half year ago as a live in carer, and group lad has been getting ready to go to university, has gotten himself angfnand isngenerally just on the right path in life.\n\nSo to give a rundown of my current situation, My list of friends has been slowly deteriorating since high school, my mental health is still a shambles, i have no communication skills or emploabilitybskills, without much chna e of holding a job as it is right now, I have no future plans, constantly thinking about death but don't want to  suss u h pain r those who have stood by me all my life, am soul crushingly lonely and I'm only about a third of the say through my life expectancy without anything of worth having been achieved. Oh and I don't really speak with dad too often. He has four kids he lives with and the oldest of my half siblings came up from England to live with him.and ended up leaving to live alone not long after.\n\nTl;dr coddled kid meets a harsh neighbourhood and then school bullies in quick succession, school staff fail to help, cause deep rooted mistrust and eventually leading to issues of self esteem, anxiety, and depression, friends have came and went, mostly went. Tried fo kill myself, failed. Haven't found a purpose in life, lacks motivation,is soul crushingly lonely and finds it difficult to put this into words. No social or emplability skills, scared of strangers, is deathly afraid of what the rest of his hopefully shirtnlife will be like. That's basically me summed up into a paragraph.\n\n I'm not expecting any thread this. Ifs quite literally my life story after all. People care less for strangers in the end and regardless of how nice of a person you are, its impossible to stay sane of you care foo much about the issues if others.\n\nAll the best to you all. If you need help with anything and are fortunate enough to realize it then do what you can for it whilst you can before you lose the will to actually care about it. Sorry if this all sounds silly and childish. I'm not really proofreading or anything, just passing time. That being said this is like the third tmie ive attempted this and the formatting keeps destroying everything when i paste it. Hopefully fixed.

I just went on a camping trip with some of my closest friends (still not very close sadly) and one of my friends was there who I haven\u2019t really talked to much in a while and I got to know them better and talk to them a lot and hang out with them and then fall in love with them.

I also think most people experience more love at the beginning of their lives than FA do ever experience over a lifetime, if they ever get to experience that at all. It's no wonder then that people suffering loneliness, rejection, and all the things associated with being FA do suffer health issues and live shorter lives. Is it also any wonder that people that don't suffer FA can't understand what FA go through? Obviously not, it's a very difficult thing to comprehend. \n\nFor most people life is wonderful, there's lots of loving people who accept them for who they are and they get to fit in and enjoy life. This usually requires very little effort on their part, it's all natural. Where for FA they don't get that acceptance no matter what or how hard they try. It's a foreign concept for others to think that you can be a good person trying your best in life and still be rejected. Often FA people get treated worse in society than criminals that hurt people. You know something like a hug, for FA person they may never even get that. Maybe even meeting up for a simple coffee and a chat a FA person might not ever have. Stuff that most would just take for granted, simple interactions. Then there's the way some in society may negatively treat someone who is FA. The bullying and the abuse that one might have to put up with.\n\nHowever anybody who tries to help FA people to me is amazing. Showing some compassion and trying to help resolve the problem that can never be solved is still a remarkable thing. It's tough for people here often to take the help offered because most the time it's stuff that's already been tried. It's basic stuff that most people already do, just because it works for you in your life doesn't mean its the magic pill that works for everyone. I still appreciate all the effort by outsiders trying to make our lives better by helping us improve our situation.\n\nWith that being said, the reason why people don't always appreciate the help is they are suffering in pain constantly. Sure you can try and distract yourself with hobbies, work etc but this pain is lingering all the time. This is how we are programmed as people, we are meant to be social and accept. Unfortunately this is the life of FA, constant pain from rejection with never being accepted. It's hard then to show appreciation for anything when life is like that. I would like to ask outsiders to envision what that is like. Think about the darkest pain you ever felt, now consider the rest of your life you'll be experiencing that. That's what it's like for FA, but what you envision is just a small taste, not  lifelong suffering.", "subreddit": "ForeverAlone"}

{"post_id": "cvtxp6", "created_utc": 1566852708, "title": "The rat appears from under the mouse hole", "author": "BoreSnoozeJack", "self_text": "Life is all about distractions. Without them, you start to realise how boring and repetitive it can be. Friends are something which helps us with the mundaneness of living. So when you lack them, it\u2019s quite miserable because socialization is the biggest distraction of them all. And as we all know, humans by nature are social creatures. Even people who are closed off need some social interaction. Having friends provides a support network of sorts. If the friendship is strong enough, you can talk about just about anything and they can do the same. \nNow my problem here is that I\u2019ve always been socially retarded. I\u2019ve had friends in the past, but as the years went on, they slowly drifted away. (Much like a Nintendo Switch Joycon) I believe how I even made friends in the past was a complete fluke because I\u2019ve been trying for years now without much success. Perhaps people can detect social retardation from a mile away. \n\n\nYou would think lonely people on lonely communities would be easy to make friends with. But no, that\u2019s not the case. You\u2019ve got to match some of their hobbies or interests, which I mean, it does make sense. It\u2019s just that a lot of the time you don\u2019t really know what their interests are exactly, because most of them are very vague in their posts.  The quirky jokes they sometimes put in there are alright, but I\u2019d much rather know which movies they\u2019ve watched or what video games they play or even other hobbies they may have. Just saying they like movies isn\u2019t helpful since let\u2019s be honest, the majority enjoys a good old movie. \n\n\nAnother issue I have is people using friendship communities as a way to try get laid or find a partner. I understand that most are at that age were settling down with their dream girl (or boy) is what\u2019s always on their mind, but the chances of them finding their dreamy delight on these friendships communities are going to be even less than making a friend. And they may claim that is not what they are doing, but it\u2019s blatantly obvious when you check their profile and almost see what looks to be the Leaning Tower of Pisa in their pants. Why can\u2019t they use the dating communities or the dirty ones if they need to let their juices out? \n\n\nI suppose I wouldn\u2019t be whining so much if I wasn\u2019t socially retarded. I mean, like 90% of the population have friends. It\u2019s a basic skill every human should have/need. It should be easy. Ack! I give up for now. I\u2019ll most likely be back at the whole finding people to pester in a few days\u2019 time. Then I can repeat the process &amp; not learn anything from my past mistakes. \n\n\nWell\u2026 this rant kept me distracted for a bit.

I look around and see all the girls I take interest in physically, or I'll see a happy couple in the parks, and it'll really set me off. I'll think about how my hair makes me look, how my face looks, how my body makes me seem (since I'm unfortunately a heavier person due to stress eating over the years), etc. It makes me feel so insecure and as though I'm lesser than everybody. It feels terrible. It makes me feel like the unwanted, unlovable scum of the Earth. The very bottom of the barrel. The bottom of the bargain bin. Etc. It just really fucks with me. I've wanted to love somebody who is attractive to me via personality and looks amd vice versa for so long. I had a thought pop in my mind this morning. I was walking through the park with my friend and his family and I thought \"Man, how great would it be if I had somebody of my own to admire during the long waits in the lines? My significant other would be off looking at the scenery out of boredom, and I could just soak in their beauty as they do. Then I'd call them gorgeous or something sweet like that, then they'd smile and we'd hug and stuff and continue to talk about whatever.\" It'd so simple yet so amazing. I want that so badly. I feel like I'm such a specific person in the sense that I feel so different from everyone and that it makes me unlovable by anybody. I don't know. It just really messes with me.

He is the extrovert and I am the introvert in our relationship. We have been together since junior year of high school. In high school I had a few friends but my whole life I\u2019ve never had a best friend until meeting my significant other. Of the few friends I had I never really fit in to any groups and have since lost touch with everyone. Fast forward to now we are in our early twenties and I\u2019ve flipped my whole life around for our future. Leaving our home towns changing my job around which has been fine but I\u2019m desperately craving a friendship with some one else any one else but I don\u2019t know how to stop isolating myself. I don\u2019t care for most of the friends of my significant other brings around. He has different interests than me and likes to party and go to concerts. While I like to stay home and relax when I\u2019m not working. So it\u2019s creating some conflict because i tell him I feel lonely and depressed so he tries to include me but again I don\u2019t feel like I fit in with his friends and I also feel guilty for always third wheeling and pathetic I can\u2019t make my own friends. It doesn\u2019t help that I work in a bank and everyone is 20+ years older than me. I didn\u2019t go to a traditional college so I missed the opportunity to meet others my age and didn\u2019t fit in with people at my high school so I haven\u2019t had the chance to be around people my age except for the friends my significant other brings around. I just feel so empty I\u2019m trying to be a good girlfriend and not smother my significant other, I try to give him space time to be with his friends as he is still in college, and we shouldn\u2019t both be miserable, but then I\u2019m left to be completely alone. Inside I feel so miserable because I don\u2019t have anyone in my life as friendship. I\u2019ve tried chat rooms chat apps but I wish I could meet someone in person and build a relationship that wasn\u2019t one sided.

I was extremely socially inept, and I admit, I deserved a lot of the harassment, but I went from being surrounded by fellow dorky Chinese kids to normal people. In 8th grade, I learned how to act, and realized what a donut I was, so I changed, and still got shat on, so I tried again 9th grade and acted normally and got teased the same fucking way. I had 1 friend from middle school and 4 close friends from the grade above me. I went to a summer camp, where surprisingly I was pretty popular, and fell for one of my friends and asked her out, and got rejected. It took a year to get over her, and I tried staying friends, but her parents didn't want her associating with me. Idk why, I didn't say anything creepy or do anything, I was making feeble attempts at small talk, which she kept shooting down, only to tell me last week she didn't want to be friends anymore. 10th grade, I was tired of this shit, so I was rude and aggressive back to everyone, and ended up getting falsely accused of being a potential school shooter. Twice. And I got fucking suspended for this, and police interrogated me and searched my fucking house to find nothing. But, there was a pretty girl in my English class, who was smart and sweet, so I started trying to chat her up, which was difficult because she's really shy. I got my ass rejected again, big surprise. Went back to the summer camp, where I have a lot of friends, and fell for another friend. Asked her out. She said yes... and then I see her holding hands with one of my male friends, and later they were stargazing while he said romantic shit to her. That felt great. Afterwards, I didn't show that I noticed anything and was friendly the same way I was before I saw that.

But there are enough posts here about people who have no friends too, so I feel that maybe if I share my experience with how I've managed to make friends, it might help.\n\nMaking friends is hard and for people in my cohort (30+) it is harder *even for normies!*  But never fear, I'm not Mr. Popular despite my dashing good looks and rapist wit, but I've managed to have a few friends back in my day.  For this post, I will go over generally what my strategy is and the few friends I can recall.  I am omitting friendzone type situations because that is some unhealthy hazardous level bullshit that should be discouraged at all costs.  But keep in mind though that in the past 15 years, I've only ever managed to make 3 personal friends, 5 if you count their significant others that I am also on good terms with.  So use my experience as a measuring stick, not as gospel.\n\nAll of friends I have today I met through work and the others I met in school.  Usually we were just working on a team or project together and since we would work late in both situations, we would get to talking about personal stuff.  If you are a boring asshole like me, that's fine - folks generally can impress people by either telling great stories or asking great questions.  I always prefer the latter because nobody needs to know about my quest to achieve Archmage Status by acquiring the three arcane relics of Avalon, not when someone's hike to machu piccu needs to be discussed.\n\nOnce I get to listening to the other person talk about themselves, I usually draw one of two conclusions:\n\n1). This person is basic as f and I should probably be cordial to them, but definitely don't want to hang out with them.\n\n2). This person is a weirdo like me and is probably going to laugh at my whacked out jokes.\n\nIf I meet someone in option 2, I tend to get more humorous with them and if they think my quirky sense of humor is funny (and they have one too) then we generally tend to get along really well and eventually possibly graduate to hanging out outside of work every now and then.  I can be quite the prankster and can definitely turn a phrase so if you don't have a good sense of humor, developing one definitely helps.  If you are a weirdo like me, you probably won't get invited to hang out with their friend group, and that's fine.  Most of the weirdos I hang out with who are really cool have godawful boring-ass friends and I don't like hanging out with them anyway. Most of them would think I am weird too, and that's ok.\n\nThere are some other  guidelines I've committed to memory whenever I am bound to have social interactions with people who are either potential friends or friends I don't want to lose.  Below are the basic rules I tend to follow to avoid getting myself into some shit:\n\n* Don't talk about being FA or depressing stuff with them.  Generally speaking, venting is unproductive bullshit - if the person I am talking to can't do something to help solve my problems, I see no reason in sharing them. Get a dog if you want someone to vent to, they won't mind.  I don't mind when people share problems with me, but if they are constantly complaining about stuff, they go into Bucket 1 above.\n\n* If you are nervous around women, don't try making friends with them first.  Learn to crawl before you can walk and make friends with people you feel comfortable talking to.  I don't really have an issue talking to women, but there are some for sure that I deifnitely avoid, particularly young single women because pretty much every guy trying to talk to them is after one thing in their minds and if an ugly guy like me comes up to them, they assume the same and react accordingly.  Definitely not worth the hassle or the sexual harassment risk.  Trust me, they don't have a problem with this policy either.\n\n* If you don't have a job or aren't in school, this approach becomes a lot harder.  Trying to cold approach people for friendships is about as creepy and weird as doing it for dates and unless you want to get pepper-sprayed or arrested, it's not recommended.  Besides, if you don't have a job  or aren't in school, you've probably got bigger problems to sort out than finding friends.\n\n* If making friends in person is still too intimidating, try making friends online!  I actually used to make tons of friends on Yahoo Clubs/Groups, OpenDiary, Livejournal, and other online posting boards before social networking existed.  I definitely would avoid doing so on Facebook or Instagram or Snapchat - those are better tools for keeping in touch with friends you already have, not reaching out to randoms to say hi. And definitely do *not* be one of those assholes posting the \"just looking for friends\" on an online dating profile - you will look like a complete tool.  I actually think reddit probably makes the most sense because if you like sports, you can go to a sports sub or if you like tech, or anime, you can find a sub for those things too.  And definitely avoid fighting with people online - it's a stupid waste of time to go back and forth with some asshole,.  Nobody ever got a paycheck for being right on the internet, so don't bother.\n\n* Don't be a dick to people.  You will be able to tell when people think you are 'that guy' or a complete asshole.  It's common sense to some people, but probably a challenge for people who are on the spectrum.  And when people tell you *how* you are being an asshole, don't argue with them about why they are wrong or demand a logical explanation for why it is offensive - listen to them and stop doing what is pissing people off, even if it doesn't make sense to you or you think it is unfair.  Or don't and enjoy the privilege of being right once again - with zero friends.\n\nAnyway, that's all I've got for today.  I definitely don't want to give the impression that any of this is a silver bullet or a surefire way to getting friends.  Again, I only really have a total of *5 friends* that I've accumulated over 15 years, but I am both ugly and on the spectrum, so if you are semi-normal, maybe this advice will get you 6 friends in that much time lol.  But this is what's worked for me so maybe there's something in there you can work with.  Oh and none of these advices will get you laid, nobody ever friendzoned themselves into someone's bed.\n\n**TL;DR: If you are having trouble making friends, I'm sharing my experience on how I was able to make some friends over the past 15 years.  Maybe it will be useful or maybe it won't but this stuff works for me so maybe something in here will help you.  Most of my friends I met at work and school and we usually became closer by talking about personal stuff after hours at work, usually by me asking them personal questions and them sharing.  Based on their answers, I could tell if my sense of humor was compatible with their and if it was, we'd fuck around and shoot the shit until they were comfortable hanging with me outside of work to do it again.  Some tips are to avoid downer subjects, focus on people you meet at work or school since you have to hang out with them anyway, make friends with men first if you are nervous around women and make friends online first if you are too nervous to do so IRL.  Also don't be a dick to people and if people are nice enough to tell you how, don't be a defensive shit, just stop doing what is pissing people off.  Or don't, I don't care.**\n\nP.S. If you hate humanity, think people are shit and that you are too good to be friends with people and/or that it's not worth it, that's fine too.

I\u2019ve started going to the gym, I lost a few pounds and even started gaining a little muscle(emphases on little lol). I\u2019ve even taken up cooking as a new hobby, and it honestly feels really rewarding when I make something that\u2019s actually good. I\u2019ve also begun to identify myself as demisexual. I\u2019ve known of the word for years, but I just recently started looking into it and feel like it mostly describes me well. This is good for me because I feel like I understand myself better and I feel like I have a group that I belong too(at least on reddit. I doubt most people in real life would understand it). I also had an amazing trip across the country for the first time. It was my first time paying for my own vacation and traveling by myself across the country. It really made me feel more independent. \n\nAll of that being said, I\u2019m still kind of a loser. I still deal heavily with anxiety and depression, I still can\u2019t afford therapy, I\u2019m still awkward when meeting/talking/interacting with people. I still live with my parents. I\u2019m still unsure of my future, I still don\u2019t have friends to hang out with(I did go on my trip with my one friend from college, but normally they live very far from me), \n\nAnd most of all, I\u2019m still lonely, still a KHV, and I still don\u2019t see a way out of being FA in my foreseeable future. But at least I\u2019ve kinda improved myself this past year. \n\nThat being said, I really want to thank this subreddit for being here. You all are the only people that I can talk to about this kind of thing. Thanks for having me. Looks like I\u2019m gonna be sticking around this sub for a while longer", "subreddit": "ForeverAlone"}

I started at 6 am and decided to go home at 8 pm so i literally just wandered around new york for 14 fucking hours straight and for like 6 hours (not in a row) i just felt real fucking sad cause i just all of a sudden felt so lonely and felt like i had  nowhere to go. I was in between manhattan and brooklyn the whole day and would commute to each borough like 3 times each but the 3rd time i went to brooklyn was because i just felt like i really just needed a quiet place to just sit and cry by myself so i decided to hop on the train to brooklyn with my tears again for the 3rd time that day and went to brooklyn bridge park and theres these rocks that are on the edge of the water so i went to the far end cause i didn't want to be around people and found little spot where i could just sit and cry but then i started writing some poetry (which i used to do alot) but then a park worker told me i couldn't be that far out on the rocks so i just found another spot on another ledge but boy i felt so fucking lonely because i kid you not there were so many couples, one couple talking wedding photos with the brooklyn bridge, someone else literally proposed with a sign and everything, another couple (seemed to be bf &amp;gf) on a photo shoot, like i couldn't turn my head without seeing something romantic and it just made me feel very overwhelmed because that is something i long for and to just see it repeatedly like that WHEN I WAS ALREADY feeling bad but all the crying and shit did make me feel a little better for a little while but intrusive thoughts just started to come in. Another thing that kinda made me feel better was that i was wearing a spiderman shirt that basically has the spiderman suit on it and i really do have a peter parker type of look cause i have pale skin, i wear glasses and i just look dorky and the fact that im a photographer and was taking pictures even sold it more and the fact that i was in new york helped to95o and lots of people noticed me. I was in the financial district and this truck driver was like \"hey look it's peter parker \" and i gave him a smile and this one cop saw me and was like \"don't start doing my job man\" and we chuckled and then i went to a cheesesteak spot in midtown and when i was leaving, this one guy who was with another a girl (couple? relative? Idk) stopped me and said \" ay yo i was really tryna tell her (pointing to the girl with him) THAT YOU'RE REALLY PETER PARKER and we laughed and he was like \"but yo fr you really do have a peter parker type of look tho\" and then i was walking to a comic book shop at like 8pm before getting on the train to go home and these 2 girls walked past me all with pep in their step and happy and singing and one of them saw me and was like \"yeah go spider man woo hoo!\" and it made me smile cause it's like people noticed me and were glad to see me, and even though they forgot about me and went about their day a second later, it still felt good, because tbh (and i don't say this trying to sound edgy or exaggerated or anything) i really starve for attention, and its for the simple reason that i don't get it alot, so having random new yorkers acknowledge me felt kinda good, not that i didn't wander around feeling like my heart had been removed from my chest, but it helped a little in those moments. I went to midtown too around 12 or 1, reason is because I have an old friend from high school who works in retail, and i happened to remember exactly where that spot is, so i thought i would fo see her, maybe catch her in the middle shift, even if it was just for a minute, just to say hi and bye. Got to the place, looked around for a while but didn't see her, and thought that maybe she was in school or maybe doesn't work here anymore but idk. I was kind of disappointed when i didn't see her, i was feeling lonely (sorry for being repetitive) and was hoping to see a familiar face, even if it was just for a moment. but i guess not. got on the train leaving new york to go home at around 8;30 but i still was still feeling shitty, but i was also tired so it gave me something else to feel besides pain. At the end of the day, I got on the train to leave new york and go home and was hoping to feel better by then, but tbh, i just felt like a bum who had nothing to do but wander and take pictures with nowhere to go. Tbh i kinda felt homeless. i cried on the way home, but felt a little better because at least i knew i had a home to go to at the moment. but yeah, i've been a very lonely person for a long time and recently have been going through something very emotionally painful for me, a certain situation that i've been involved in for more than a couple of years that has resurfaced recently. just found this subreddit, probably gonna try to talk to some people here.\n\nTldr; i'm a lonely person with fucked up issues, spent the whole day in new york, hoping to feel better, ended up just feeling really alone, and i'm a mess who cries alot", "subreddit": "lonely"}

Because I have some really great friends which I have decided to surround my self with a lot more recently.\n\nBut when I have tried to let someone into my life and becoming vulnerable in the situation I got hurt. Basically what happened was that I liked a guy and at that time we were friends for a good while and I had a feeling that he liked me, then one time he sent me a heart so I sent him one back and he didn't text me for a long time. He then started texting me and then he stopped all sudden. I then find out that he blocked me on Instagram and I had no reason why he blocked me. I asked my friend to ask him and he said that I did something wrong and I have no idea what I did wrong still. Later I told my mum that he blocked me and a few months went by and I found out that my mum went up to the guy that blocked me and she asked him why he blocked me and stuff like that, the thing was that she went up to him while he was working at his families business while it was super busy. I found that out the day before the ball. Ever since then I wasn't able to face him. The guy which blocked me is really popular among our year group, I stopped liking him but the guy that I recently have crush on is mates with him. So I decided to keep my distance from the whole friend group. \n\nSince then I've left so lost a left out from our year group. I stopped hanging out with my friends which dragged me down and I started hanging out with people which truly care for me. But I feel like I've been left out recently. I tried being there for all my friends but never in return they ask how are you doing, or if I want to hang out with them or if I was okay.

I thought people used Tinder to date and smash, not literally play Smash.God I hope she doesn't steal my Switch. :(\n\nAll my other matches (all 1 of them) on Tinder kind of died out after I asked to meet them for a coffee date.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\*\\*Update\\*\\*\n\nAlright, so I went on the \"date\".  \nMaybe my standards are too high.\n\nWe  met up at the mall and played one round of Smash. Very curious is she  said she did not play Smash at all. That raised my eyebrow, but I played  it off pretty cool saying that it doesn't matter, just as long as you  have fun playing.\n\nThen she wanted  to walk around the mall, so we did that. She was very socially awkward,  even way more than me. I initiated most of the conversations. She talked  about how she was unemployed and not looking for a job, banned from the  Starbucks for accidentally flashing someone there, could not legally  drive (due to underage drinking/suspended license), homeless and  couchsurfing, she had court tomorrow for something, and wandering around  Hot Topic saying that shirt was cool or whatever (probably hinting at  me to buy it for her, maybe?). She was also showing me make-up tutorials  for stuff like Jeff the Killer cosplay and other horror stuff. I was  getting pretty weirded out at this point and didn't buy her anything. I  set a timer on my phone while she was trying to find someone to borrow a  cigarette from and told her some of my friends wanted to meet up a bit  earlier than was planned. I cordially excused myself and gave her a hug.\n\nOne  thing I omitted from my first post is that she wanted to come over to  my place before even meeting up in person, which I thought was strange,  and I was the one who suggested meeting up at the mall instead.\n\nSo,  not really a catfish, just Red Flag the Date. It was my first date too,  so I think I'll probably just play video games and work out for the  next 50 years. She was cute, but ugh... It was too much for someone like  me to put up with.\n\nI guess I'm  not hug-less or date-less anymore. Maybe could've fucked her, but  definitely would've had to go to a hotel or something (because I don't  want a moocher/stalker) and I'm not suave enough to bring that up in  conversation.\n\nI also had a good  conversation with the Starbucks cashier (guy) who noticed my Death Note  shirt and Zelda beanie (I dressed nerdy because I thought it was more  casual than a polo, and was expecting to just play Smash lol). So not  all is a loss and I'm grateful for the experience.\n\nAnd my Switch wasn't stolen!", "subreddit": "ForeverAlone"}

Subthreads in a thread about mistakes people make in their 20s - and it becomes so stupidly obvious that most of this shit is not applicable to my life in any way, because it carries the starting assumption that you are at least a minimally functioning human being.\n\nIn contrast, I'm reminded of the virtually insurmountable dysfunctional hole that is my mind and my life, and in recognizing that I am trapped, combined with my occasional inability to feel like doing anything, a speck of psychosis sets in and I become antsy, unstill, and in need of some physically impossible cathartic release. So I eat four store brand poptarts, because nothing fucking matters.\n\nSometimes I regret not killing myself several years ago. It really was the opportune time. It's too late now though, and I promised my mom that I wouldn't.\n\nI'm arguably less depressed now, but I never regained the will to live, so I guess I'm living half for her sake, and the other half out of sheer inertia. I have some music I've been going on about since forever, that supposedly I'm going to finish, but I'm still burnt out and it feels like a chore at this point.\n\nYet sometimes I'm not even that depressed - I'm just fucking blank. Going through the motions every day of browsing Reddit, reading news, playing Words with Friends, jerking it to porn, consuming media. Maybe I can actually live like this until I get to die? Or am I only this sedated because I still imagine I'm going to finish projects someday, and improve myself, and it's technically not 100% certain that I'm going to die alone?\n\nYeah, every so often my dad tells me how things are going to get better. He's too smart to actually believe that though, so perhaps he's trying to convince me or convince himself.\n\nI mean let's get real here. I'm unemployable, locked into government quasi-poverty, never went to college, and can't drive. I'm intensely alienated, distrusting, and avoidant, even for an aspie (hell, I think this is the first time I've posted on Reddit this whole year). At 26 there's basically no one left to befriend even if I were in a state of mind that could. There's no community or fandom I can ever really feel part of. I may never be able to fix my stuttering. I have nothing to say about anything because I've been isolated all my life and have no experiences or common ground with anyone who is remotely functional. I do not exist. My sexuality exists entirely within the context of porn and is a split contradiction. For over a decade I have had a deep emotional attachment to gay furry characters and it will not fade no matter how much pleasure I also get out of real-life amateur straight human porn. I don't know how to be attracted to real people, and I sure as hell wouldn't be able to attract anyone past three seconds. And that's if romance and companionship are even worth wanting, and trying for. There is no dreamgirl/dreamboy who, undeterred by all of that, is going to reach out to me and become my best friend.\n\nThis is not a life you can simply change and leave behind. This is not something you recover from. Boy do I wish I could be normal and have a heroin addiction for a few years and then come out the other end with an inspiring story and move on with my fucking life. No, this is the slow decay of an invisible man.\n\nI'm probably going to end up like those poor old men in Japan who die alone in their apartments and nobody notices until months later when the corpse stench reaches the hallway.", "subreddit": "ForeverAlone"}

Is fake connection better than no connection?\n\nHey guys, this is my first post in this subreddit but I think I\u2019m in the same boat as all of. I\u2019d like to start with a little bit of back story. I was a happy fun kid til I was about 10. Two critical things happened at this point. First and by far the most impactful is that I became a fat kid. Secondly, my mom got a huge promotion and my dads lawfirm took off. Because of this I was switched to private school while all my friends from elementary continues into public school. What this mean was I knew nobody going into middle school and I was incredibly ashamed of being fat. I grew up in Los Angeles where looks are everything and I was surrounded my movie stars children and children of very successful parents, and we all know, attractiveness is usually required for incredible success.\n\nAnyways, I was acutely aware that I didn\u2019t fit in to this social standard. 10 years old is when I started my battle with suicidal depression. I am 29 now and have dealt with it ever since. Throughout middle school I gamed addictively to distract myself and have an excuse to be at home where I was comfortable. It wasn\u2019t until freshmen year of high school that I finally met people. Unfortunately I only did this through drugs and people knowing that I could get money to pay for it. I knew I was being used but didn\u2019t care because I had human contact again. It was mostly guys but also a few girls, though none were ever interested in me. This was the start of my constant battle with drug abuse because I truly equated it to fixing my loneliness.\n\nBy the time I got to college I was a full blown heroin addict. It was the one thing in the world that stopped my suicidal thoughts and made me comfortable talking to people. When you want to kill your self all day every day for years, that few hours of respite is the only thing I cared about. Unfortunately though, this never led to a sexual relationship because I could never get myself to escalate to that point. The one good thing it did is make me skinny. I\u2019m riddled with body dysmorphic disorder so I always feel fat and ugly but I know that my weight was also 50 pounds lower than it was before.\n\nI dropped out of college due to my addiction and moved back in with my parents. I continued to get high until my mom was diagnosed with cancer. That finally led me to my first period of sobriety. Because I blamed all of my problems in life on having been fat, I told myself that all my problems would be cured if I was in great shape. I didn\u2019t have to work at this time so I focused entirely on fitness and diet. Within a year of 3 hour gym sessions a day, many personal training sessions, and an incredible strict diet, I got to where I thought I wanted to be. I had an 8 pack and 7.5% body fat. I used to strut the beach but nothing changed. Though I may have got a few more glances... I was still a shy little bitch. I relapsed and then thought a great career and success is what I needed to find a girlfriend. I achieved all that within 2 years (through my moms company) and still that didn\u2019t work. I was a virgin still.\n\nAt 24 my drug use and thievery got too much for my parents and I was kicked out. It wasn\u2019t until I was literally homeless that I had my first sexual encounter. It was with another nasty homeless chick that agreed to do meth and have sex in my motel room. It was intense but also a very bitter and sad way to lose my virginity. A few months later I moved to Colorado to attend a rehab and try and get my shit together. I staid sober for 16 months with literally no interaction with females. \n\nIt wasn\u2019t until I was 27 that I had my first relationship. It was with a manager of mine that had been fired because of her drinking problem. I was not attracted to her but she was skinny and gave me the time of day. Because I still cared so much about appearance, I was embarrassed to take her in public and admit she was my gf. She has lots of trauma and was as sexually repressed as I was. We never did anything more than regular sex. I did love her though for the fact she knew all my dark secrets and did not run. This lasted a year before I ended it. I was feeling less depressed at the time and thought I\u2019d be able to do better :(\n\nIt wasn\u2019t until I had a period of sobriety that I focused completely on socializing. To me, this meant hanging with someone every day. Whether it be a guy friend or an online dating girls. I had sex for the 3rd time with a tinder girl I met. She was very clear she just wanted \u201cfun\u201d and after one time having sex she thought she\u2019d hurt my feelings because I was too clingy. (Sex without intimacy is not what I want) the second girl was very sweet and her body was great but she had a facial paralysis that I wasn\u2019t attracted to. (I already know I\u2019m an asshole :() \n\nAfter that I found out I had to do drug court for a felony I caught early moving out here. Since then, everything has gone to shit (not that it wasn\u2019t before). I am terrified of every female I meet and am unable to go in public because I know no girl will ever want me. I have hot female friends but they have explicitly said that nothing will happen between us. Even though it hurts me, I\u2019d rather have any female contact than none.\n\nAnyways, the question is asking is this. I have inherited a very large sum of money from my moms death 2 years ago. It\u2019s not as much as my friends but it is 8 digits. To me, the only thing I feel I have of value is my parents money. Though money is nice to have, it\u2019s caused me sooooo many problems and insecurities. I always try to keep it low keys when dating and nobody wants the person I am.  At this point I have been debating just putting it out there and finding a gold digger. Though I\u2019d be devastated knowing my connection only cared about money, I\u2019m getting to the point where I don\u2019t care about it. A gold digging female in my life is better than none right?\n\nI\u2019ve had 2 suicide attempts in the last few months because of this never ending thought of never finding a female to care about me. I\u2019ve been told that I am attractive by many people and am in good shape, but those attributes mean nothing if I\u2019m a scared little bitch around girls and can\u2019t make any moves. Should I just bite the bullet and find a chick that just wants me for money? Or hold out for this \u201cperfect girl\u201d I\u2019ve been told about and looking for for almost 2 decades.\n\nI hate money and believe it corrupts everybody and would be dealing with the constant thought that I\u2019ve never lived up to my parents and never will. Also the thought of a girl fake liking me for money makes me incredibly sad and insecure.\n\nIf you read all of his, thanks. I wish you all the best in your future.", "subreddit": "ForeverAlone"}

Story time:\n\nAbout 9 months ago, I did something as a joke to one of my best friends - I edited some pics of him and photoshopped him onto some people. But I took it too far (unintentionally) and ended up sending these to my other friends and one of his college friends. **He was pissed...really pissed**. I'd never seen him this angry before and I realised I fucked up. Anyways days passed and I tried to make it better cos I felt super guilty and said sorry a bunch of times but he wasn't buying it. He said he couldn't trust me and that really hurt me.\n\n**I** accepted full responsibility, **was guilty** and didn't insult or swear at him at all, he did nothing wrong but he said a lot of bad shit but I let it all slide cos I deserved it. **I refused to back away** from him and **tried for endless months for us to become friends again** \\- I even used multiple numbers to message him because he kept blocking me (I know that it probably made it worse).\n\nMy other 'friends' didn't want to get involved but were on his side so I got blocked by my best friend, then the others followed apart from one. I'd never felt like this before, **I was guilty and hurt** even though I had caused it. My friend laughed when I said 'I hope we can be friends again' and said that's never gonna happen - that stuck with me and sent me into a poor mental health state.\n\nI've been depressed for years but it wasn't that bad, only when I was alone. Anyways, within a few days, I started to self harm and ended up crying most the time, I just remember feeling like utter shit - I didn't realise how crucial my friends were to my mental state since they were the only friends.\n\nFast forward to **a couple of months ago**, my former friend unblocked me and **wanted to make peace** and I did. A few months before this, I literally begged him to stay friends and to just go back to normal but he said no. But during that time, I told myself that I wouldn't make any friends and would just rely on myself because I'm depressed and couldn't go through something like this again - least of all being dependent on friends to keep me happy.\n\n**Now he's messaging me trying to make me laugh and play video games with him** and the others. **A part of me would love to become friends again** **but** I **just don't feel comfortable anymore with people** even though I know it would make me happier.

I dont think he meant anythibg by it and I'm grateful he was willing to send me dinner, but now in hungry, sad, lonely, and I wish my girl wanted to hold me or visit during break. Its whatever. I'll keep smiling, loving, laughing, and moving. Wether I want to or not.", "subreddit": "lonely"}

I'm at such a point in my life where I have some time to talk, but a lot of people who reply, seem to have normal busy lives, so it's difficult to bond, especially given the time difference. So, my hope is to find a person in a somewhat similar situation (in other words, someone who doesn't have a well-measured, well-adjusted 9 to 5 lifestyle, but who is lost at their life's crosspath).\n\nI'm looking for a FELLOW ADULT (sorry for caps), who's open-minded towards audio conversations (on an app). It could be entirely anonymous (no video), but I'm sadly not huge on texting, hence my preference for voice, which I find to be a more human-like medium and experience. I can understand obvious hesitance that some people could have; from my end I would do everything I could to preserve the sense of propriety and mutual respect.\n\nGeneral interests: literature, art history, philosophy, psychology, economics, languages, geography.\n\nMusic (all over the place): Seafret, M83, Philip Glass, Lord Huron, Radiohead, Sigur Ros, Mogwai, Of Monsters and Men, Yndi Halda, God is An Astronaut, Godspeed You Black Emperor, Keaton Henson, Laura Marling, Max Richter, If These Trees Could Talk, Clint Mansell, some songs of Sia and Adele, and many other artists. If you don't recognise some of those names, it could be a plus, because we could mutually enhance our preferences in music.\n\nLiterature: non-fiction (microhistory, biographies, geography and culture); fiction as in sci-fi, mystery, thriller, subtle philosophical supernatural horror. I'm more of a prose person, though I do appreciate some poetry from time to time. I might not be really refined for it? I find narratives extremely compelling, especially when it comes to crafting the story in a way that ensures the flow of events and miniscule details that are going to build up towards the resolution. I prefer contemporary prose, althought I have done my share of getting to know some crucial classics (mostly, Western, sadly), both for school and out of my own curiousity. When it comes to psychology, my horizons were influenced partly by Viktor Frankl, Erich Fromm, Rollo May, and some others who worked within the loosely defined existential school of thought. Favourite philosophers? I haven't read a lot of primary sources, but I did find reading Schopenhauer, Sartre, Camus, Benatar, challenging (in a positive way). Philosophically speaking, my interests concern mostly ethics and aesthetics. Recently I've developed a more nuanced perspective on merits of different approaches towards such topics as anti-natalism and abortions debate, so if that interests you, we could discuss those.\n\nMovies and TV series: haven't seen one in a while, but I used to like Black Mirror, Sherlock, House, Futurama, Elementary, and a few others. Broadly speaking, I like film experience that attempts at focusing on complexity of human condition, that's why I tend to gravitate more towards philosophical films.\n\nI watch quite a lot of YouTube: educational, popular science channels, BookTube, social commentary, some podcasts. I'm quite fond of science communication in the fields of physics and biology.\n\nA bit more about me: Depression issues and anxiety; not really vehemently into intersectional social justice and a bit socially conservative (but I am not a bigot, I would never take into any kind of consideration your gender identity, race, etc.); do not play any videogames. I'm a bit of a bookworm, and I tend to talk about lofty, ivory tower ideas, but some have told me that I do possess a sense of humour (which is probably amongst the most subjective types of assessments).\n\nI suppose, I'm looking for a person who also feels a tad lonely and in need of some emotional support. It'd be great if we could stay in relatively frequent contact. I hope I do not sound very entitled, putting forward all these things about the 'ideal' person to find on here. My rationale is that it might help to give others a perspective on how to structure potential connection (if any, depending on what you think, after finishing reading my post).\n\nI've posted this quite a few times, so my sincere apologies to the not-first-time readers.\n\nThank you for reading this.

We had an amazing day and we concluded we were in love.

She told me it didn't feel right and she didn't feel what she thought she was supposed to feel. Then she left. I have never been so devestated.

What does she want from me? Higher self-esteem? Another guy to orbit her? Maybe not and she could be a good friend. Now after being FA for so long, I've become paranoid that nobody understands being FA except for you guys and they will just assume I never tried to escape FA. \n\nI know it will be difficult for most outsiders to understand because they have never been FA, but, when you are isolated for such a long time, you start to believe anyone who wants to talk to me will just get mad at you. You believe that nobody actually wants to talk to you and is just talking to you because they are bored or interested like you would be interested in a zoo animal. It becomes a recurring cycle and you push people who could have genuine intentions away because I assume when I talk about being FA, they will just give meme advice then get mad when I tell them it didn't work for me. In some cases the person does just want to feel better about themselves, gives meme advice, and gets mad when I say it didn't work. Some do say, with that attitude, you will always be FA. The problem is, I react the same to people who just want to help me. \n\nI know it sounds like I'm trying to make excuses for my behavior but 15 years ago I was almost a different person. Now at 36, I've been reduced to a paranoid shell of my former self. I'm so toxic, I should be glowing green. I don't think I will ever be able to let someone in close enough to even be friends anymore. Unless someone can erase my memories, all my emotional baggage from being FA with no friends to go out with for over 10 years will ensure I will never be friends especially with women. I hope none of you end up in this position. FA eventually poisons your mind.I deserve to be isolated because I let my paranoia that most people either want to use me for self-esteem or give meme advice and get mad even if they just want to be nice.

Anyways, things since I posted had gotten considerably better, my roommate has been encouraging me to talk more just in general and I\u2019ve been feeling good, like I\u2019m coming into my own and not only that he started a real LDR so he doesn\u2019t bring girls back to the room anymore he just tries to wingman for me. But, 2 things happened recently that I just can\u2019t understand.\n\n1- right before he and his girl decided they were going to really date, a random girl added him on IG and he messaged her. I remember it very clearly, he showed me her profile on a Monday, got her snap that same day, and by Wednesday he fucked her. That fast and all from online, and she basically approached him too (she followed him first and liked his pictures, an invite to a DM as he put it). Afterwards I kinda straightforward asked him how he did it lol and he just said she was a sl*t and it could\u2019ve been anyone. I get he was trying to make me feel better but it didn\u2019t. He said it could\u2019ve been anyone, but why wasn\u2019t it me? None of these \u201csl*ts\u201d that \u201cwould sleep with anyone\u201d have ever wanted to sleep with me. And that made me feel really unwanted.\n\n2- the second story was a more direct insult. This came last weekend, he said he would wingman me and he did a great job. He made me approach a group and everything went great at first, until we got back to our place. The first thing you could tell was the one girl I wasn\u2019t talking to was upset that my roommate had a gf and wasn\u2019t gonna do anything with her so she kinda put a damper on the night. But the real killer came when we started playing games. The first game was kings cup and we had to do \u201cnever have I ever\u201d a few times and the questions were mostly sexual and I never had to put any of my fingers down. The girls took notice and asked me if I was a Virgin, which took me by surprise so I ended up admitting I was. They handled it well but you could tell the attitude changed. Not long after that, my roommate tried to set me up, and made a rule in the game that whoever lost either had to shotgun a tall can or kiss me. The girl I was interested in lost, and without question shotgunned the tall can. And about 10 minutes later they decided to leave. I cried that night in my room, I had never felt so unwanted or blatantly disrespected in my life. I can\u2019t blame them for not being attracted to me, but I really don\u2019t understand why no one is.\n\nTL;DR- even with the help of a \u201cchad\u201d, I can\u2019t succeed with women.

I live far away from my family, but even if I lived close they\u2019re crazy and I wouldn\u2019t see them much to save myself from being sucked into the crazy. Idk what to do. How do you make friends as an adult? How do you put yourself out there? How do you get over the fact that you\u2019ve spent your entire adult life with a man who cheated on you and now you don\u2019t know how to function as a single person in society? How does everyone not just die from the crippling loneliness. I\u2019m so depressed and I have no one to talk to about it. I\u2019m so incredibly lonely. I crave human connection but I don\u2019t know how to get it aside from sex and being in a relationship. I just want a friend I can talk to about my problems, someone to assure me that I\u2019m not alone and that everyone goes through this shit. I want someone I can call up in the middle of the night because I\u2019m shitfaced at some bar I can\u2019t remember the name of and I need them to pick me up. Media portrays this impossible goal of friendship. This impossible connection between people where they help each-other judgement free and are there for each-other when they need them to be. I\u2019ve never had that and I don\u2019t think I ever will. Unless I find another boyfriend another man to fill the void I\u2019m scared I\u2019ll be alone forever. I\u2019m scared to be alone. I\u2019m scared to be without anyone in my life that really knows me and cares about me. Why is it so hard to connect to people. Why is it so impossible to find \u201cyour people\u201d?", "subreddit": "lonely"}

My loneliness has really gotten to me lately. When I was a teen I would always try to brush it off &amp; put up a fake facade. I would try to be funny and the life of the party. But, as I reached the end of high school &amp; now, being 20 years old I\u2019ve realized how worthless I am. I feel my loneliness is so strong due to the fact that I am a closeted homosexual. I feel so trapped and ashamed of myself. I used to accept myself but I don\u2019t know what it is now. My thoughts of self-doubt and self-hatred have returned. I feel so bad about myself and maybe it\u2019s for good reason. Why would I be like this when I go against everything natural? I feel so dumb for being so wrong. I wish I was normal so I wouldn\u2019t have to deal with this. Knowing that you\u2019re whole family would damn you to Hell once they know is so isolating. I don\u2019t even believe in that shit. I\u2019ve already made peace with removing myself from my family once I can get away from them. They won\u2019t have to see me again. The worst thing is I know they know about me being gay, they just haven\u2019t said anything about it. Probably hoping I\u2019m just a late bloomer &amp; will finally find a girlfriend. I just feel so pathetic and alone. I\u2019ve never had a boyfriend or any guy, or girl, want me. I feel like an alien walking the earth. I am so depressed on the inside but I guess that\u2019s my punishment for being gay. I wish I knew for certain this is it &amp; that nothing matters. What if they are right &amp; that I am sick in the head? I always talk about this on Reddit but I have no one to go to.

Not in a desperate 'I need to call a suicide prevention hotline and have someone talk me down'  type of way.  It's more long term, almost every day.  For years now.  I'm incredibly lonely and tired of my life.  I've tried to change things, tried to fix things.  I'm a screw-up. \n\n  It never gets better.  Maybe it will someday, I don't know.  I doubt it.  I'm estranged from my relatives, haven't seen them for years.  I have very good reasons for that, so it'll never change.  But it doesn't stop me from wishing things were different.  I don't know what family gatherings are like. I don't have brothers or sisters to lean on, or parents to borrow money and get advice from.  And it hurts. It hurts being an outcast.\n\n I don't have any friends.   People don't like me,  they never have.  I'm not intelligent,  charming or funny in a way that most people would like.  And after a terrible childhood and years of being ignored and rejected by people,  I've developed near crippling anxiety and a tendency to avoid people. I can't overcome either of those things.  Honestly, even if I made friends tomorrow,  I'd probably end up ghosting them without really wanting to. Because I'm just fucked up in the head,  and it's another thing I can't seem to fix.  \n\nI'm alone in the world, and it's unlikely to change.  When I die no one will know or care.  No one will remember me. I'm having trouble caring anymore. About any of it.  That's where the constant suicidal thoughts come from.  I haven't had a bad week or few years.  Life has been a long, lonely nightmare, and I would mostly like it to end soon.  \n\nI'm writing this because I just feel so hopeless and alone, even more than usual.

Here is were comes to me that thought about see them 5 days at week. \n\nSometimes also I feel like I'm not taken seriously about meetings or social events. One friend have a local band and he used to invite me to his concerts, me and another friend were the ones that always were there, even one time we were the only two people in the bar the band was playing. Then his band start growing in the local stage and I'm happy about it, but he stopped inviting me personally, I'm not angry because he's not telling me personally to go, but because the band still tell my other friend to go personally and once again I feel like I'm not taken seriously, this two people, whose I considered my best friends even hang out sometimes without telling me. \n\nMaybe because of this when they actually invite me to go to the cinema or at the bar I just use excuses to not go or leave the place too early. I may be wrong in this case. I've close my Facebook account because I feel hypocresy in some of my \"friends\" there (and those leaking information, but thats another post). Still use Twitter and reddit basically because memes and whatsapp because I'm forced to due to projects in school etcetera. \n\nThrough the years I've feel that I have switched more to an introvert person (if that's possible), or maybe I'm just sad or depressed, I don't know, it had happend another things besides this to make me doubt about my feelings. My grandfather died in april, but he struggled since last year, I said goodbye to him in the hospital in january, I knew he won't last any longer, but I promised him that I will graduate from college and that he will be there to see me. Then my brother, who have had a drug addiction had a baby born in june, two days after this the was smooking weed in the same room as my nephew. Fortunately he started rehab. Later, in july a cousin die from a run over. \n\nAs I said before, I'm not sure if I'm just sad or depressed, I start tearing when I saw something cute, sad, beauty or literally anything that produces a feeling. \n\nAfter all, I'm trying to do my best everyday, music is like a medicine, I'm not leaving my house without my earphones. Although I feel loneliness sometimes, I do actually like to do activities on my own, such as go for a walk, go to concerts, etc. I'm planning to go and see Once Upon a Time in Hollywood this friday alone. But sometimes I'ts just frustrating the feeling of being alone even when you are around people. \n\nFinally, I would like to say that if this isn't the right sub to tell this, let me know. Sorry for grammar/spelling mistakes in advance.", "subreddit": "ForeverAlone"}

So, my hope is to find a person in a somewhat similar situation (in other words, someone who doesn't have a well-measured, well-adjusted 9 to 5 lifestyle, but who is lost at their life's crosspath).\n\nI'm looking for a FELLOW ADULT (sorry for caps), who's open-minded towards audio conversations (on an app). It could be entirely anonymous (no video), but I'm sadly not huge on texting, hence my preference for voice, which I find to be a more human-like medium and experience. I can understand obvious hesitance that some people could have; from my end I would do everything I could to preserve the sense of propriety and mutual respect.\n\nGeneral interests: literature, art history, philosophy, psychology, economics, languages, geography.\n\nMusic (all over the place): Seafret, M83, Philip Glass, Lord Huron, Radiohead, Sigur Ros, Mogwai, Of Monsters and Men, Yndi Halda, God is An Astronaut, Godspeed You Black Emperor, Keaton Henson, Laura Marling, Max Richter, If These Trees Could Talk, Clint Mansell, some songs of Sia and Adele, and many other artists. If you don't recognise some of those names, it could be a plus, because we could mutually enhance our preferences in music.\n\nLiterature: non-fiction (microhistory, biographies, geography and culture); fiction as in sci-fi, mystery, thriller, subtle philosophical supernatural horror. I'm more of a prose person, though I do appreciate some poetry from time to time. I might not be really refined for it? I find narratives extremely compelling, especially when it comes to crafting the story in a way that ensures the flow of events and miniscule details that are going to build up towards the resolution. I prefer contemporary prose, althought I have done my share of getting to know some crucial classics (mostly, Western, sadly), both for school and out of my own curiousity. When it comes to psychology, my horizons were influenced partly by Viktor Frankl, Erich Fromm, Rollo May, and some others who worked within the loosely defined existential school of thought. Favourite philosophers? I haven't read a lot of primary sources, but I did find reading Schopenhauer, Sartre, Camus, Benatar, challenging (in a positive way). Philosophically speaking, my interests concern mostly ethics and aesthetics. Recently I've developed a more nuanced perspective on merits of different approaches towards such topics as anti-natalism and abortions debate, so if that interests you, we could discuss those.\n\nMovies and TV series: haven't seen one in a while, but I used to like Black Mirror, Sherlock, House, Futurama, Elementary, and a few others. Broadly speaking, I like film experience that attempts at focusing on complexity of human condition, that's why I tend to gravitate more towards philosophical films.\n\nI watch quite a lot of YouTube: educational, popular science channels, BookTube, social commentary, some podcasts. I'm quite fond of science communication in the fields of physics and biology.\n\nA bit more about me: Depression issues and anxiety; not really vehemently into intersectional social justice and a bit socially conservative (but I am not a bigot, I would never take into any kind of consideration your gender identity, race, etc.); do not play any videogames. I'm a bit of a bookworm, and I tend to talk about lofty, ivory tower ideas, but some have told me that I do possess a sense of humour (which is probably amongst the most subjective types of assessments).\n\nI suppose, I'm looking for a person who also feels a tad lonely and in need of some emotional support. It'd be great if we could stay in relatively frequent contact. I hope I do not sound very entitled, putting forward all these things about the 'ideal' person to find on here. My rationale is that it might help to give others a perspective on how to structure potential connection (if any, depending on what you think, after finishing reading my post).\n\nI've posted this quite a few times, so my sincere apologies to the not-first-time readers.\n\nThank you for reading this. Feel free to PM me.", "subreddit": "lonely"}

It\u2019s not a choice it\u2019s just a thing my anxiety has caused. If someone talks directly to me i\u2019ll usually nod my head or give a 1-3 word response but nothing much.\n\nLast year I stopped going to school halfway through the year due to panic attacks. I ended up doing this program for the rest of the year where I went to this room and worked on Apex Learning for 3 hours. It wasn\u2019t a very good program, didn\u2019t teach me much.\n\nI\u2019ve been back in school for about 2 weeks and i\u2019m already considering suicide. Hell, I have a manipulated schedule where I only go 4 bells a day and I still can\u2019t handle that.\n\nI\u2019m taking 4 classes this year. English ll, Geometry, Psychology, and Biology. I\u2019m usually a math hater but so far I understand what\u2019s going on so i\u2019m good with that. What I absolutely hateee it\u2019s Biology. There is so much group work. I never end up talking in the group and it\u2019s so much harder for me to learn working in a group.\n\nThis is the worst part: I\u2019ve been lashing out at my dad. It\u2019s not his fault i\u2019m just a bitch and feel terrible about it. He got me on a modified schedule for my benefit and I still don\u2019t appreciate it. He tries so hard to help me but I pay him back with yelling at him and ignoring him. He\u2019s all i\u2019ve got and I treat him like shit. Its like can\u2019t control myself.\n\nMy dad doesn\u2019t want me to do homeschool because he thinks it will just make me every less social (which is probably right but it\u2019s not like I talk to anyone at school anyways. haven\u2019t had a friend in years.) As much as I want homeschool I know it\u2019s not gonna solve anything. I\u2019ll still be depressed, anxious, and suicidal.\n\nThe main reason i\u2019ve been suicidal lately is because I see my life going nowhere and i\u2019m just a burden to my father. He talks about how \u201che does so much for me and I pay him back by being rude\u201d which is right. I\u2019ll never enjoy living no matter how hard anyone tries to help. I have no aspirations. No talents. The only people I really look up to are actors and singers cause all my \u201chobbies\u201d are recreational stuff like that. In fact a lot of the best actors and famous people die young (but they tend to be at least in their 20s, i\u2019m 15 and don\u2019t know if I can make it till then.)\n\nI\u2019ve tried manyyyy therapists and meds but none have been successful. I would tell my dad all this stuff that i\u2019ve been writing but I don\u2019t want to further stress him out.  Also when I do tell him how I feel he goes and says one of his few repeating phrases ( you need to work out, life isn\u2019t supposed to be fun, i\u2019ve tried everything i can do, just deal with it, go live with your mom.) I know he\u2019s just trying to help but i\u2019m tired of hearing the same stuff.\n\nI\u2019ve been thinking about how I would kill myself if it actually ever comes to that. I was thinking about an overdose, a lot of celebrities die from that. I don\u2019t want something messy like Hannah Baker (speaking of Hannah Baker, i\u2019ve only watched the 1st season of 13rw and it fucked me up for weeks.) Being murdered also sounds cool, puts less blame on me and is easier for my dad to deal with.\n\nThis is really long but i\u2019m a complainer and have no one else to talk to. People on twitter have just completely stopped interacting with my tweets cause of how annoying I am. I\u2019ve been on there for 5 years and haven\u2019t made a single friend.\n\nYou don\u2019t need to message me being like \u201chey wanna talk?\u201d cause if i\u2019m being honestly that never helps me.

They allowed my mother and father to be in my life still because they thought i deserved that much i guess so growing up i knew my father and mother. My father was in and out of my life same as my mother for a while and life was prettt smooth my uncle D died and my mom took it hard but i don't really remember that around age 5 or 6 my mom and and dad seperated now 2 of there children where young adults and out of the house but me and their youngest who i will refer to as BM had to love through it with front row seats during this time my dad left and started livong out of town and my father was a deadbeat who didn't do much for me at all except let me know and meet his side of the family my half brother and sister, my aunts and uncles and cousins and to be honest i never really fit in with them mostly because they enjoyed bieng stereotypes and i was never really liked that. So with no one else to take over BM took over as my dad basically finished off where our dad left off he tought me how to ride a bike,make friends,play basketball,how to be fubny and over all was a great roll model after during this tome our dad was still in our lifes but had to fix himself before he could a dad my mom the other moved and took me with her to house after house for about 5 years and then tried and failed to get back together with my dad during this time it became pretty obvious that was really intelligent not reallt Einstein level but smarter than the average smart kid and i quickly started devolving intrest opposite of the rest of my familybwhere they all chose just to live life like we where raised and really only care about yourself and family in that order i decided that i wanted to fix the world and help people and that i didn't really matter  which caused and still continues to cause conflicts between me and my family because they don't understand how they're idea if thinking that you are only here on earth to take care of yourself and family and if you try to take on the world's problems by yourself you will lose yourself is the problem because if i everyone tried to take care of the world's problems we would be fine but digress. These conflicts have made me cinical towards my family and  to society because this is how i generalize how people think.\nSo now im just a doing nothing im to angry at the world to help it but i feel to guilty about it and punish my self in dumbways like i have a weight problem and anytime i make any progress on losing weight i eat like there's no tomorrow gaing more than i lost. I hang around people who use me and work a job i hate more than any thing in this world just to punish my self for bieng angry at something i know is so stupid and unfair but i cant help it. Finally my new way of punishing my self is to form great bonds with people i care about and sabatoge them not consciously but it always seems to happen and i think its because i can't stop telling lies about dumbshit because im embarrassed like i make up storys about parties girls i slept with and a strong family bond to cover the fact up that im a virin shut in who couldn't bed a girl if his life depended on it who barely talks to his non immediate family.\n\nIt took me like 3 hours to type all of this and i don't feel any better but ima post it any way maybe some one can help with my obsession with subconsciously punishing my self or maybe im delusional and its a conscious choice idk any advice could help also i know my writing kinda jumps around alot with little structer towards the end sorry", "subreddit": "lonely"}

Anyway about 4 months ago I met this gay guy on reddit, wasnt intentional or anything like that. I was just struggling with my sexuality and he sent me a message. I just assumed he would be like everyone else and ghost me after a while but then we started talking deeper and deeper about things. As usual I got attached and actually started developing feelings for him, I'm not sure if these were true genuine feelings looking back and probably more were that I felt like someone actually cared about me for once. \n\nThen I just started thinking about him a lot, I wanted to text him all the time and just be around him. BUT the issue was we were in different countries, me in UK and him Norway. I did not care however in his eyes it did matter. \n\nNow this is where it all went wrong, he was giving me hints and signs such as saying I would totally date you and I would kiss you that I got super happy, ok he was a guy and I never experienced that before but the truth is not any person in my life has said that to me. So for someone to tell me this after feeling so damn lonely for so long was just like wow I can't believe it. However alongside this he played games, tried making me jealous of saying how he can get any guy he wants irl, was kinda proud that he cheated on his own bf with a girl at a club and even his actual bf was underage \ud83d\ude43. \n\nBut still after all this because I thought someone actually gave a fuck about me I just pursued him and got rejected over and over again. He sent me on break after break to say I need to clear my head and it's all my fault, on one of my lowest nights ever when everything was getting to much for me I reached out and told him everything I was worrying about and said this is your issue so you deal with it. \n\nI was absolutely heartbroken, a complete mess. I have told him multiple times since I can't contact you no more and need to end this, but everytime he suddenly opens himself completely up and says sorry and all of this, however a few weeks later it's all back to normal, everything my fault and my feelings are not worth the time. \n\nIk full well he doesnt give a damn about me. I managed to break away about 3 weeks ago now and was doing ok however stupidly I looked at his reddit profile and hes just been showing off about how many guys like him on tinder, hes above everyone and it just made me feel so shit in thinking what havent I got. Yes we may have not worked out cos long distance, like I know this full well but did he really have to string me along, blame everything on me and make me feel totally worthless. \n\nI'm sorry if I dont make sense, it just hurts so much to be treated like I am nobody, here I am still wanting to care for him and think about him whereas off he goes not even a single thought about how I am and just yh it sucks that I'm so damn lonely and all I ever do is gravitate back to the same type of people all the time. \n\nI'm sorry it's so long, is there anything I can do to get over this once and for all? How do I stop attaching myself to bad people like this? \n\nThanks", "subreddit": "lonely"}

I was happy in my romantic fantasies, believing that in a few years they would become reality. I would think about all the places I would go with the girl of my dreams. My favorite destination was a sunset beach. I'd imagine us holding hands, walking along the shoreline. Eventually we'd sit down and kiss. Maybe I'd take out my guitar and serenade her with a song expressing my love. Then we'd cuddle through the night. Just the two of us in this vast universe.\n\nI'd hear that women wanted men to be more affectionate. That men only wanted sex while women wanted to be shown love in other ways. I thought I'd make my future girlfriend feel so loved, that I'd be the perfect boyfriend. I could not wait.\n\nFast forward six years, and I'm still alone. Everyone around me has had sex, or at the very least, has had affection shown toward them. Instead of girls, I have the company of severe depression and anxiety. My friends all talk about how great sex is: it feels great, it boosts your confidence, and it gives your life meaning. Fuck, I haven't even had a first kiss. If I try to get closer to someone, they always pull away. The most attention I get from girls is weird looks, like they are displeased at my existence. \n\nOccasionally, one girl may show me basic human kindness, and my fantasies emerge from under my hardened shell. You'd think I would learn by now that they are bullshit. But no, my natural, optimistic side takes over and sends me away into the fantasies, until the girl shows me no more attention.\n\nI'm naturally a highly empathetic, sensitive, and optimistic romantic.

I was generally happy, especially with the few friends that I did/do have, but I never got into a relationship. \n\nTo put it more accurately, I\u2019ve never been with anyone because no one has ever seen a potential partner in me. \n\nI\u2019m not horribly unattractive, but not conventionally pretty either. I have and have had lots of friends, so I don\u2019t think it\u2019s my personality. But at this point, I half want someone to just grab me by the shoulders and tell me straight why no one has ever liked me that way. \n\nAll that to say: I\u2019m now at college, in a situation where I\u2019ve made a fair number of friends, some guys some girls (probably close to 50/50 mix) and over all I\u2019m having a really good time. \n\nThen I met X. \n\nHe\u2019s really funny, and a lot like some of my best friends back home. We click pretty instantly, and have a really similar sense of humor and interests. \n\nYeah, I\u2019m not gonna try to lie to myself about it. I really like him. As a person, and as a potential partner. He\u2019s just a really solid, good guy. \n\nSo here\u2019s the kicker: over lunch a few days after X and I started talking, a friend confessed she had a big crush on him. \n\nMy first instinct was to help her talk to him. Get her his Instagram. Invite him with us when we went out for dinner. I\u2019m not totally sure why I did that, but I did. I guess my fight or flight decided a friendship was worth more than a potential relationship, but now I\u2019m kind of worried. \n\nX and I have been hanging out a lot the past few days - mostly coincidentally, being in a lot of the same clubs and such - and it\u2019s dawning on me that no matter what I do here, I\u2019m kind of fucked. \n\nIf I try to bottle or get rid of my feelings for him to let my friend in, I could lose the only real shot at a relationship I\u2019ve had in forever. \n\nIf I continue letting my feelings and our friendship grow despite my friend\u2019s feelings, I could really hurt her and that\u2019s the last thing I would want. \n\nAnd even if I do do that, there\u2019s still the possibility of him not liking me the same way, and then I\u2019m left with neither of them. \n\nI don\u2019t want to stay lonely forever, but I have no idea what to do. \nAny advice is appreciated. \nThanks.", "subreddit": "lonely"}

I've always had this sinking feeling in my stomach that says, something is wrong, that \"I don't belong here\" I can remember a moment in primary school, when I was 6 years old and I was silenty sobbing in my seat while the other kids were packing up their things from the lesson, when my teacher asked \"What's wrong?\" I could only respond with \"Everytime I'm happy every one is sad and when I'm sad everyone is happy\". I felt and still feel as if everyone is in their own bubble in life and rarely consider someone else emotions rather than what they can do for you.\n\nThis would be something that would plague me throughout all these years to today, 18 M. I've tried many different ways to get out of this zone but to no avail, people don't care about me at all no \"Hi how are you?\"  \"What's wrong?\". I don't want to be the first to contact and that last one to receive messages, I don't want to be the one helping those who will not give me the time of day. No matter who I face no matter how \"nice\" and \"cute\" or \"considerate\", it all ends the same. They have left me for dirt. People only care if I have something they don't. I'm always ignored and I honestly cant find any solutions to my issue and it infuriates me on an unhealthy level, where I'm pent up with some much rage and confusion that I'm terrified as what will happen to me. The only reason I have committed suicide is because my family doesn't deserve any pain of that caliber especially since my sister past away.\n\n\nI don't have anyone else beside my family but even then, they are that helpful in giving advice. My father has depression but he deals with it by smoking and coffee. It hurts to see people in groups happy chatting whatever and here I am the spector only able to eavesdrop.  I have tried interacting people of course but it always feels empty. The depression from my isolation has manifested itself has pains in my chest, I've been to the doctors and have been told that nothing is wrong with my heart or chest. \n\nThe only way I'm coping right now is learning a new language (German), playing piano, reading books and studying alot, as a substitute for my porn addiction as a result of depression. I'm also avoiding people as they've disappointed and hurt me so much that I try and keep my head down and not talk to anyone. It feels satisfying to when they're walking with you and they stop to talk to someone as you keep moving passed trying to get to your destination. Only to have them confused and wondering why am I not waiting for them like a puppy dog so I can entertain when they return from their conversation and resume walking with me. I'm also planning to delete and block most of my school \"friend's\" numbers so I don't have to have my hopes when they respond to my messages. \n\nThis is my first time I've truly vented to other people  rather than thinking out loud. And of cource any thought to do with post would be appreciated.  Thank you for taking your time to read this.", "subreddit": "lonely"}

I genuinely thought it was real until I had woken up. By the way, if anyone wanted to read that analysis I promised months ago, I promise, I WILL write it, even if nobody will read it. I'm not done partially due to reasons described later.\n\nSome real-life context. I am doing an internship at a research centre, which has its own buses for workers to commute. I was riding them to get to and from.\n\nSo, in the dream I get on the bus, I sit down. A girl is going to sit down in the row in front of me, and she's saying something. I look at her and say \"hi, excuse me?\" because I didn't hear what she said. She looks at me confused, and then I realise she had an earpiece she was talking over. I laugh and apologise. When she's done talking, she turns back to me and starts talking with me, and then she asks if I want to go for a coffee later that day. Obviously, I accept, because I'm lonely as fuck. I don't even drink coffee and I actually cancelled some plans I had that day so that I could go out with her. We keep talking until she must get off the bus, but not before giving me her number.\n\nThat's when I kind of thought: this is going way too well. Nothing ever goes this well for me.\n\nAnyway, I realise I've actually gotten on the wrong bus and I don't know where I am. On the next stop, I notice a tram which goes by my house, so I get out there. Here's something that didn't really make sense. I was about to call the girl for her to have my number, but then she sends me a text message, that she's looking forward to seeing me.\n\nWhile I'm heading towards the tram station, I must get down a set of stairs. Stairs so unrealistically steep, in fact, that I'm almost afraid to walk down them. That is when the alarm rings and immediately makes me realise - it really was going too well. I am back to being completely friendless and lonely as fuck. I do not have a date with a sweet girl to look forward to.\n\nI felt especially lonely that day. I have potential to build a pretty good life when it comes to career and hobbies. But it just doesn't feel like it will be satisfactory without anyone. I really have nobody, all \"friendships\" fizzle out before they properly form. I really, really, want a friend or a girlfriend, I feel so fucking lonely. Later events of today reassured me for the n-th time, that even my family are not my friends or allies.\n\nWhat the hell am I supposed to do? Is there a way to win this situation? If I don't deserve to be happy, okay, that's fine, but am I really expected to just accept it?? I don't want to live this lonely life. The loneliness makes me feel so horrible!! I don't want this!! Realistically, it will not get better. I always hope it will, but it never does. I really need to do something about it. Almost all day, I've felt so fucking bad over being so lonely. I really must do something about it. Within two weeks, I want to kill myself. It will not get better. I hate myself and I hate life.", "subreddit": "ForeverAlone"}

Dont let anyone ever make you feel bad for who you are, own that shit. We are or have been through so many awful situations to the point where the loneliness feels normal. Fight that feeling of desolation, dont let it define you like it do for me for so many years. You are worth more. You are stronger than someone who has never dealt with a neverending despair. Let the emotions flow through you, keeping it inside will eventually cause you to break under all the pressure.\n\nYou are more than your height, weight, social class, job, or sexual experience. Never let these things DEFINE you, but instead use it to your advantage. The people who only see the surface have no depth for themselves but instead focus on the stupid shit that society has deemed unworthy. They would never be good partners for us, we are wasting time playing a game that we were meant to lose from the beginning.\n\nSweet and kind people do exist, and never give up searching for them. The wait is worth it. Hell even cuddling with someone you love is such a pleasant activity, or holding hands is just as awesome in your mind as it is doing it. Trust me on that. So many things in the modern world are overhyped or overrated.

I learned so much about the language and got out of my comfort zone and talked to so many locals and everyone was so kind. I was going out to bars and getting smashed almost every night and still managed to get great grades with minimal studying because I tried to speak in spanish as much as possible outside of the classroom. I went on reddit maybe twice for a half hour the entire trip.\n\nI have had very little experience with women and I got more action there in 6 weeks than the other 22 years of my life. I had 3 separate instances were mexican women started grindin on me in the club out of no where and making out with me. One of them even hopped on me in the uber and starting blowing me haha it was wild.\n\nI also went on my very first date with a different girl before that and it was terrible. The movie sucked (The lion king), the language barrier was rough, and I made no moves during the 2 and half hour movie because I was too nervous. She even commented about how nervous I was in line and I felt so much worse. She gave me a ride and I couldn't tell if she was trying to kiss me and I went for an awkward mexican side kiss thing and dipped.\n\nI just don't understand how to talk to women. The only intimate encounters I had were when women literally came on to me and it was easy. I am so afraid to initiate because I cannot read signals unless they make it very obvious, and I don't want to try and make it awkward if they aren't interested. I think I only had those encounters in Mexico because I'm white and maybe they assumed I was rich and they had beer goggles on.\n\nI've been back in the states and it's been terrible. I have barely any friends in my college town and I have no motivation to continue learning spanish on my own. I used to read so much and I have piles of books to read with no desire to start. I've just been working, jerking off, and spending hours on reddit (especially the incel sub). And the program was overpriced and now I have barely any saving to continue my last year.  I did start going to the gym and I feel good for maybe an hour or two until the endorphins wear off. Feeling like shit.\n\nSorry for the rant guys. Thanks for listening.

I started entertaining the idea of marrying a mail-order bride when I was 21 after it became clear women were not into me. I put it off hoping that something would change. Nothing ever did, women still aren't into me.\n\nI'm ready to marry, I'm fully independent of parents, six figures saved up, no debt etc... I love everything about my life except being FA. My money rocks, my way of living rocks, what I do with my time rocks, all that's missing is the love of my life.\n\nAs you'd expect, girls never respond to me on OkCupid, Tinder, Bumble, or even eHarmony while women on the mail-order bride service I use typically reply. I've been chatting with some of them for a month, and I've had some deep conversations with a few of them. I'm going to propose to one of them after a year or two of getting to know them better. I'm using a mail-order bride service that I've seen first-hand work. The beauty of it is that divorce rates for mail-order brides are lower than domestic marriages, who knew?\n\nOn another account I went on the dating advice subreddit about marrying a mail-order bride and what did I get? Nothing but victim-blaming saying I deserve to be FA because I must not have put any real effort into trying to escape FA when the fact is I've done more than any rational person would have.\n\nI've dressed like a slob, I've dressed in a $900 suit, I've had the worst hair, the best hair, I've been a NEET for months, I've made over $150,000 working. I've hated school, I'm now attending graduate school, I've been a recluse, I've joined clubs and gone out drinking. I've joined paid dating sites, I've done nothing. I've given up only to try again. I've been massively unconfident, I've been confident, I've been myself, I've intentionally acted the exact opposite how I'd normally behave. I've conquered all my fears by \"cold-approaching\" women and sky-diving. I\u2019ve had high standards and no standards. Believe me when I say any combination of things you suggest I've already tried.\n\nIt's really clear normal people have no idea what we FA go through, accusing us of not trying to escape FA when I've put more effort into escaping it than anyone else would have. They really can't conceive of a world where effort doesn't result in a good outcome. They think we FA have done nothing to try to escape FA, they're the biggest example of the just-world fallacy I've ever seen.\n\nIt's clear normal people despise me for being FA, and will continue despising me for marrying a mail-order bride. No matter what I do they're not happy so screw it, I'm living for me now.\n\nI've had it with what normal people say that I don't deserve love, that I must be a terrible person for being FA, that I must be some fat, broke loser living in his parents' basement when the fact is I've been both, I've been a NEET living with his parents, and now I made $140,000 myself, no trust fund, completely independent of family and going to graduate school, I've been both.\n\nI\u2019ve also had it with incel ideology of LDAR. I refuse to LDAR. One way or another I\u2019m escaping FA even if it kills me.\n\nNot a single woman in America has ever flirted with me, I\u2019m willing to bet $100,000 that no one, not even the biggest \u201cchad\u201d could get a domestic girl to like me. My mind is 100% made up, I\u2019m marrying a mail-order bride to escape FA or die trying. Screw what normal people or society thinks.", "subreddit": "ForeverAlone"}

Ultimately what lead to my enlistment had to do with the fact that I had nothing left in my shitty hometown. Four year after high school many of my classmates were still in town, seemingly doomed to be stuck there. Even my best friends seemed to doomed to be stuck there, despite having good jobs &amp; stable relationships with others &amp; family.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhile at basic training I endured, I suffered, I adapted &amp; I overcame. Most of the company came to know me as I was easy to chat with, though I was interested with the opposite sex as obvious. However that changed after graduation &amp; I found myself en-route to AIT, job training. Ft. Jackson trains mainly non-combative/support MOS fields (comms, supply, medical just to name a few). I was the only soldier in a company of 150+ that was going into artillery meaning I would be flying out to Ft. Sill. I didn't mind it until at the airport when it hit: everyone I had crawled, rucked, shared an MRE with, they were all gone. I was all alone. There were about four other soldiers from Echo company that came with me, but they were strangers at that point. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhen I started AIT I had to start the process of making friends with the soldiers in my class. I had gotten along with most of them, though there were those I just couldn't click with. I was always the outgoing one, &amp; everyone seem to know me by the end of the first week. Towards the end however in formation, whilst everyone was off talking with each other, I realised something: I was alone. If I were to walk off in the middle night only the sergeants would notice as is their job to ensure we're all accounted for. Even on graduation night,  I was alone celebrating by myself. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI found myself at airborne school(\"My Story\") where I would be dropped from the course to medical reasons. At this point I knew I wouldn't see many of the soldiers I was with, a new shipping rooster was posted weekly to various Army bases across the globe. I would say goodbye to the people I had come to known, not feeling anything as I was accustomed to everyone I know leaving, keeping in touch with a few gals that slowly petered out over time. Eventually my time came &amp; I found myself en-route to Washington state along with several others. At reception we learnt which units we would be attached to &amp; while I can't say where I'm attached to, I can say I was the only one from my group going to my new unit. Once again I was alone. I wouldn't see any of the people I had come to known in the past few months, not even my reception roomie that I had become good friends with.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI've been at my unit since, with an assignment to Korea coming soon. I have a roomie, I've come to known the soldiers in my unit, &amp; yet...I feel like a stranger in a strange land. Yes I'm well known already thanks to my platoon putting me as the unofficial guide on &amp; because I'm the new Private. Sometimes the sergeants will talk to me about events the Army has planned, though the Army won't allow NCOs to hang out with lower enlisted. The Army installs a mentally of teamwork, but I find myself allow, feeling like a bother to the soldiers as I don't have a license to drive or having to ask what we're doing. My best friend from basic is currently en-route to Afghanistan, another is in Ft. Bragg awaiting her deployment, another a girl I still fancy but sadly will never be with. Surprisingly her &amp; I are from the same shitty state of AZ, like a fairy tale story some would say, but as we all know not everyone gets a happy ending. We were hoping to spend holiday leave together but she won't be able to. I don't plan on visiting my home state after this holiday.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAs of now I keep to myself, texting my soldiers only if I need something (driving lessons). I'm usually asked about taking a  duty shift as I never have anything planned, weekends spent reading, Xbox, gym time &amp; sleeping. I'm accustomed to spending my time in the Army as a hermit, avoiding social interactions. After the last girl I simply stopped with relationships, not wanting to get my heart broken again. I focus on myself, getting in shape, reading more, &amp; going to school. I hope to reclass into aviation, drone pilot, spending 10-14 years before I apply for any of the three letter gov. agencies.

I got a new job recently and I\u2019m finally planning to go to college soon for a career I think I\u2019ll really enjoy, something I thought I\u2019d never do.\n\nBut in moments like these, I guess it just all comes back. How I\u2019ve been for years. I dwell on every little ounce of shame I carry with me. I have no social life at all, mostly because I just haven\u2019t tried and also because I\u2019ve always been genuinely bad at it. Again, I feel these things can be improved genuinely if I make an effort to work on myself. But how I feel in these moments really draws away from it. I think of all my failures and mistakes and it eats at me. I feel like I\u2019m truly a loser just masquerading as someone decent, like I\u2019m in denial and can\u2019t accept that I\u2019m meant to just be alone forever. Sometimes that feels like an easier alternative, I\u2019m not cut out for any of this but I have to suck it up and keep fighting, hoping I find what I\u2019m looking for.\n\nI just feel like a failure, I\u2019ve made efforts at improvement but it still will take time. That\u2019s what I keep saying, \u201cit will all take time.\u201d But, how much time do I really have?", "subreddit": "lonely"}

It's been bugging me lately", "author": "Jimmy244", "self_text": "Why does this ALWAYS freaking happen to me?\n\nSorry this is long.\n\nA bit about me. Growing up, I never really had any real friends apart from acquaintances in school which we would talk mostly about school stuff because I was always afraid of my interests and personality being weird to others or afraid of getting picked on which has happened a bit. I am still in college and nothing really changed. Everyone has their groups and cliques it seems and they don't seem welcoming. I always was the shy and quiet kid, usually content with being alone though so it never really bothered me too much until I was about 20 and started feeling more lonely. Longing for friends and relationships. I just turned 23 not too long ago and every now and then feel like this. I've suffered from anxiety and depression for years and only recently started taking something for it which seems to be helping a bit and now I don't think too negative unlike before, but the negative and self-loathing thoughts are still there every now and then.\n\nI've made a few online friends or chatted with girls on online dating sites here and there, but they were pretty much strictly online or strictly business related, except for 1 girl that catfished me when we met on a date, she was a lot different from the pictures and was a bit rude. All have ghosted on me. Last month, I made an online friend on a website after I asked about a product she was selling which we have a mutual interest in, and one thing led to another and we found out we had a lot in common more than that and became friends. We'd talk to each other with long messages every couple days, not everyday as she has a busy life which is fine I get that. She seems like a genuine, caring person who seems to really listen a lot. She has told me that I am such a nice, friendly, interesting, and awesome person, but sometimes I don't believe it. I feel like I have nothing to offer and always in self doubt.\n\nA few weeks ago though, she met another friend the same way as me, and it turned out they actually live very close to each other. He has also came in contact with me too when she told him about me. Though he doesn't talk to me much privately but whatever. We do have a 3 person chat too which is fine, though I never feel comfortable with more than 1 on 1 conversations and always end up feeling like a 3rd wheel. Over the past week though, my friend has been talking to me a bit less, lately it's more her responding to say she was busy, etc. Not much responding to previous messages. I don't need to message first with her which is a great thing even when we do have normal conversation. But my assumption thanks to anxiety and negative thoughts usually occuring at night, is that she probably enjoys talking to him way more than me, plus they actually have met so there's that. The other friend seems like a funny person who makes jokes, one of those types of people who post memes and stuff, seems outgoing with his friends (yet from what she told me he said he doesn't seem to have many friends) On social media for example, she seems lately to gravitate towards responding to &amp; liking his posts where as she used to do that to mine before. She seems to always be online and so does he, sometimes it seems they log off &amp; on around the same time. She does have other in person friends that she had for years though which she told me about. This is also not about romantic stuff which is also perfectly fine as she has a boyfriend which I knew about from the very beginning. It's purely a friendship thing which I am more than happy with as I usually have fun talking to her.\n\nAll in all, I deep down feel like she doesn't really like me that much after making a new friend that's probably better than me. Despite telling me how much I mean to her, etc. Even going so far as telling her family and friends all great things about me which nobody really does, and even goes out of her way sometimes for me. She has even told me that she loves me which I found a bit shocking at first. All these negative thoughts about our friendship is thanks to anxiety. Like I feel like she's going the path of my other friends I had. I.e. ghosting me. Probably because I have nothing better to offer than their other friends.\n\nI really want to ask her about this, but I had a previous friend 2 years ago and things ended badly when I asked her about why she wouldn't respond to me. Except with that friend, I always had to message first, and so on.\n\nSorry this was long, just bugging me this week.", "subreddit": "lonely"}

In pre school I always liked playing by myself with these dinosaur toys they had. I never had a sibling of any sort so I never really had anyone to hang out with and I naturally learned how to entertain myself with toys. As the years went on and I went into elementary school there was much more pressure to play with other kids but I was still wanting to be on my own. I made a few friends here and there but most of the time I was on my own. Since I was on my own a lot too I began to lack social development. I struggled to make friends since I wasn\u2019t used to it, and I wasn\u2019t really into trends since I often didn\u2019t like trends or even know what trends were. I didn\u2019t have Pok\u00e9mon cards until I was 13. I kind of struggled with a lacking social status. I didn\u2019t really know how to treat other kids and I kind of became a tattle tale just from natural progression (I feel bad about it now). I was like this until middle school where things got bad. Since I didn\u2019t really pick up on social queues, people sometimes took advantage of me and would kind of treat me like an animal since I was predictable. It\u2019s kind of hard to describe. For an example, I didn\u2019t want a kid to say something so he said \u201ctell you what if you throw this away for me I won\u2019t say anything\u201d and I threw it away thinking he was serious, and they laughed at me. There was just lots of stuff like that but eventually I picked up on it which kind of destroyed me. I felt like I had been bullied for years and I didn\u2019t know who to trust anymore. I decided at that point to consciously double down on being quiet so at least no one could do that anymore. This was an even worse mistake though because I grew somewhat... I don\u2019t know a good word for it. I was way too protective of myself and was quick to snap at anyone. Usually they\u2019d just laugh if I did though. I grew out of that now thankfully and I\u2019m mostly functioning but the fallout still affects me. I still have the same 2 friends who stuck with me since elementary and no one else. I\u2019ve tried a few times to make friends. In fifth grade I tried befriending someone who turned out to be a manipulative bully. Another guy ended up just being selfish and didn\u2019t care about actually being friends. In eighth grade I tried joining this friend group who ended up doxxing my steam profile to students and doxxed my real name to a small game server I played on. At that point i had lost all hope and trust and made peace with the fact that I\u2019m not going to make any more friends in K-12, not as long as this fallout of a past I couldn\u2019t really predict haunts me. I\u2019m 16 now and although I carry myself well whenever people *do* talk to me, it\u2019s such a rare occurrence that it might as well not matter. I\u2019m ignored 9/10 of the time. Exceptions apply during group projects or when someone *particularly* extroverted who knows nothing about me is forced to sit next to me.\n\nSometimes I wonder too if my living situations affected this at all. My parents were divorced from a very young age, first off. And for most of my life I haven\u2019t lived in very nice homes. Don\u2019t get me wrong, my parents are okay-pretty standard, but the other people I\u2019ve lived with were crazy. I had a step mom for about 5 years that wasn\u2019t great. She had her moments but the way she was just did not work with the way my dad was and it resulted in a lot of tension. I also lived with my uncle for 5 years with my mom until this year. He was fucking horrible. He was an alcoholic, has a mood disorder, was a hoarder, and all around a fucking nuisance. I shut myself in my room everyday for 5 years. We called the cops on him once because we thought he was going nuts from alcohol but he wasn\u2019t even drunk. I\u2019m glad I\u2019m out now though. But I do wonder if living with those people affected the way I communicated with my peers. \n\nAs of now I am still lonely. I actually decided recently to enroll in a program that\u2019s like dual enrollment but I get off school earlier in the day, and that reason alone was a big incentive for me. I don\u2019t like high school. Nobody likes me, the teachers barely. I figured if I\u2019m going to get an education I\u2019m doing it in a place where I feel accepted. Plus I can get lunch wherever and it\u2019s free too.... Even so, it\u2019s still a lonely existence.", "subreddit": "lonely"}

I went twice alone and I hated it even though the beaches etc were beautiful. I just wish I had someone to play ball with in the water. I don't ask for too much. I grew up in a rural village with almost no one my age, I used to have friends but they had to commute to me for an hour or I had to commute to them so all friendships died off eventually. I'm moving out of that rural village next month but I'm not too excited. I will be 25 next year. I want kids one day because I have so much love to give and I want them to have the freedoms I didn't have - I'm gay, which I would have **never chosen to be**. Nobody would choose that. I don't like the gay scene, all the hyper focus on sex, I don't like any of these apps etc. and hooking up tires me to death. I don't pitch my voice up for no reason or emphasise words wrongly. Also I have never really felt romantically for a guy, I always \"felt\" guys as friends, colleagues. I don't know if I'm able to be romantic with a guy, to me it feels rather ridiculous because I see guys as friends and not romantic partners. \n\nBack to my future kid. It will not have to fight their parents for years to eventually get to the job they want to do. It will not be  forced to apply for dozens of jobs they would absolutely hate with no regard to what they want to do. But still, I don't know how to have a kid. I might have to save $100k for a surrogate and I don't know if I will have that much by age 30. Also, it will be hard for me as a single full-time working man to be accepted to have a baby. As of now, the more realistic future for me is that in my 40s, 50s and beyond I will still be childless and single - and miserable. I try to avoid that though. I try to save for the baby. I could raise a kid with a woman but I don't know if she will enjoy a sexless relationship. I don't know any guys who are too interested in raising a kid with me. The guys I know just continue looking for hookups in their 40s, 50s.. and stay forever childless. Even the couples stay childless. There is no long-term happiness for me in that lifestyle. There is no pressure on me to have kids, I just can't imagine never having one. I don't see a future without having a kid, and I don't want to adopt.\n\nAnyways, yesterday I found out a band I really like (Tool) released their new studio album - the first after 13 years of break. I feel alive for the first time in ages. I don't remember when was the last time I actually felt anything at all. Occasionally I have tears of joy in my eyes as I'm listening to it right now because I didn't realise how much I missed them. I can't really describe it. Ever since I listened to their first album I became hooked and just loved them. I don't know. They just somehow gave me hope and I feel much better now. I feel *less alone*.

I'm at such a point in my life where I have some time to talk, but a lot of people who reply, seem to have normal busy lives, so it's difficult to bond, especially given the time difference. So, my hope is to find a person in a somewhat similar situation (in other words, someone who doesn't have a well-measured, well-adjusted 9 to 5 lifestyle, but who is lost at their life's crosspath).\n\nI'm looking for a FELLOW ADULT (sorry for caps), who's open-minded towards audio conversations (on an app). It could be entirely anonymous (no video), but I'm sadly not huge on texting, hence my preference for voice, which I find to be a more human-like medium and experience. I can understand obvious hesitance that some people could have; from my end I would do everything I could to preserve the sense of propriety and mutual respect.\n\nGeneral interests: literature, art history, philosophy, psychology, economics, languages, geography.\n\nMusic (all over the place): Seafret, M83, Philip Glass, Lord Huron, Radiohead, Sigur Ros, Mogwai, Of Monsters and Men, Yndi Halda, God is An Astronaut, Godspeed You Black Emperor, Keaton Henson, Laura Marling, Max Richter, If These Trees Could Talk, Clint Mansell, some songs of Sia and Adele, and many other artists. If you don't recognise some of those names, it could be a plus, because we could mutually enhance our preferences in music.\n\nLiterature: non-fiction (microhistory, biographies, geography and culture); fiction as in sci-fi, mystery, thriller, subtle philosophical supernatural horror. I'm more of a prose person, though I do appreciate some poetry from time to time. I might not be really refined for it? I find narratives extremely compelling, especially when it comes to crafting the story in a way that ensures the flow of events and miniscule details that are going to build up towards the resolution. I prefer contemporary prose, althought I have done my share of getting to know some crucial classics (mostly, Western, sadly), both for school and out of my own curiousity. When it comes to psychology, my horizons were influenced partly by Viktor Frankl, Erich Fromm, Rollo May, and some others who worked within the loosely defined existential school of thought. Favourite philosophers? I haven't read a lot of primary sources, but I did find reading Schopenhauer, Sartre, Camus, Benatar, challenging (in a positive way). Philosophically speaking, my interests concern mostly ethics and aesthetics. Recently I've developed a more nuanced perspective on merits of different approaches towards such topics as anti-natalism and abortions debate, so if that interests you, we could discuss those.\n\nMovies and TV series: haven't seen one in a while, but I used to like Black Mirror, Sherlock, House, Futurama, Elementary, and a few others. Broadly speaking, I like film experience that attempts at focusing on complexity of human condition, that's why I tend to gravitate more towards philosophical films.\n\nI watch quite a lot of YouTube: educational, popular science channels, BookTube, social commentary, some podcasts. I'm quite fond of science communication in the fields of physics and biology.\n\nA bit more about me: Depression issues and anxiety; not really vehemently into intersectional social justice and a bit socially conservative (but I am not a bigot, I would never take into any kind of consideration your gender identity, race, etc.); do not play any videogames. I'm a bit of a bookworm, and I tend to talk about lofty, ivory tower ideas, but some have told me that I do possess a sense of humour (which is probably amongst the most subjective types of assessments).\n\nI suppose, I'm looking for a person who also feels a tad lonely and in need of some emotional support. It'd be great if we could stay in relatively frequent contact. I hope I do not sound very entitled, putting forward all these things about the 'ideal' person to find on here. My rationale is that it might help to give others a perspective on how to structure potential connection (if any, depending on what you think, after finishing reading my post).\n\nI've posted this quite a few times, so my sincere apologies to the not-first-time readers.\n\nThank you for reading this.

Since I've been here, I have realized I never really learned the social skills to make friends.\n\nEven back home in Canada, I really only have 1 person I could actually say is my friend. \n\nI have people I could ask to do things, but I never write or ask them to do something because I always feel like I would be bothering them by asking, or that they will think it's strange that I'm asking them to do something because we're not friends and honestly, I don't know why someone would even want to be my friend. I have the feeling constantly that people don't actually like me, and are only nice to me at work or in other social situations because the have to be.\n\nI had a girlfriend for several years, but was never actually attracted to her or wanted to be in a relationship with her. I just didn't want to be alone. Everytime I've actually had genuine feelings for a woman, they have never been returned. This has left me thinking that there must be something broken in me because I always end up falling in love with women who don't love me back.\n\nAs a very young child my mother left me and moved several hundred Kilometers away. It just happened suddenly. One day I woke up and she was gone and I didn't see her again for several years afterwards.\n\nIn the meantime my father remarried. His wife turned out to be a horrible human being. She was very physically and emotionally abusive to my sister and I. Things like getting thrown down a flight of stairs when you are 7 years old and being screamed at because you forgot to close the car door leave a mark.... nuff said. That marriage lasted until I was old enough to fight back. One day I broke her nose and gave her 2 black eyes. Yes... I beat up my stepmother. My dad was always at work and really just didn't pay attention to the situation. He just drank beer until he fell asleep. He has suffered from extreme depression his entire life.\n\nIn school I was bullied constantly and never had any friends. I was always angry and withdrawn, which was understandable considering what was going on at home. Because of this I never really learned how to socialize well. I eventually quit highschool because being there was so painful.\n\nAs a teenager and into my early 20s I did copious amounts of Drugs. By 14 I was doing 8 balls of cocaine and selling weed to finance my habits. By 18 it had evolved into doing Crystal Meth.\n\nSomehow, at about 22 I pulled my head out of my ass, went back to school, and became an electrical engineer. At 22 years old I started at a grade 8 education level.\n\n\nCareer wise I've managed to be fairly successful, although no matter how many projects I successful complete, I always feel everything I do is shit, and could have been done better. I never feel like I've done a good job, although my coworkers always comment about the high quality of my work.\n\nBeing here in a foreign country has made really think about who I am, and what it is I actually like. I'm trying to make friends by doing activities with various groups on a regular basis. (Playing frisbee, learning German, photography) but I always leave after the events are over as I always think people don't actually want me there.\n\nI would also really like to start another relationship, and one day have a family, but how can that ever happen for me when I always feel I have nothing to offer.\n\nAny advice is welcome.

Overall  it was a very quiet, conservative small town.\n\nIn  high school, I had a class size of 36 students. We all came together  from about 7 different neighboring towns. In school, we only had the  basic classes, Math, English, Science, etc. No elective classes, no  clubs, nothing to be a part of except for sports which weren't for me.  Most of the student participated in at least one sport, while I just sat  back and watched. The entire town our school was located in, would come  to every soccer, basketball, and baseball game. Everyone knows  everyone. Basically, if you did not play a sport, you were and outcast,  that was me. I got to watch as my classmates made the most out of there  high school years, while I just went home after school everyday with  nobody to hang out with. In fact, every single weekend of my high school  career, I never once had an opportunity to hang out with someone. I  just sat in my bedroom staring at the wall, or wandering out in my  backyard. That pretty much sums up my time in school.\n\nI  did go to college for one year. It was a small community college. I was  really hoping this could be my chance to make a new friend. Nope.  Everyone at that college was from the surrounding area, and everyone had  their group of friends they brought with them. Pretty much the same as  high school. I really did try to meet new people. I would walk around  campus, to the cafe, library, through the halls, everywhere. There were a  few clubs, but when I finally thought I had the courage to join one, I  would walk by the doorway to the room, see all the people in there, then  chicken out. My anxiety beat me again, and I just walk to my car and  wait til the next class, which I did every day.\n\nI  got really tired of college, so I dropped out and got a decent job in a  manufacturing facility. It was much better than my best day in high  school or college. I work there 5 days a week, and take any overtime I  can get. I am the youngest person working there, the next oldest is like  37. This is pretty much the first time people actually talk to me. And I  loved it. I love working because it is my only time I get social  interaction. In fact, for a while I didn't like not being at work  because I had nobody to talk to. I got a promotion, and I am now a  mechanic. Everything was going great for once.\n\nI  am also gay. I wish I wasn't but I am. There is a push on me to keep  the family name going, as I am the last male in the family. Well, it's  not going to happen. I really wish I could have a child. I am trying to  accept all of this but it's really difficult. I have only told a few  people my secret. I have also never been in a relationship either. The  only gay guys I know are quite feminine (not that there's anything wrong  with that) but not my type. Any dating app I've used is filled with  people that just want to hook up, which I also don't want. I want a  serious, long term, monogamous, relationship. Someone I can share my  life with. And my looks aren't keeping that from happening, I am very  confident with my appearance.\n\nSo  thus far in my life, I've had no friends. (I have people I talked to in  school), and never been in a relationship. At least I have a job I like.\n\nOver  time, the enjoyment of work wore off, and I was feeling like my old  depressed self. I took to drinking and pot, and pretty much used those  as my only source of enjoyment.\n\nI  still live near my hometown, and It kills me to see everyone I grew up  with living there lives to the fullest, while I just sit in my living  room chair and watch youtube, and waste my youth. People tell me to put  myself out there, and meet new people. Well, that's easier said than  done. Also, growing up, every adult in my life, loved the fact that I  was so quiet and reserved, when all I wanted was to do stupid shit with  the friends I wish I could have had. I always hated it when adults would  call me a loner and a homebody, like it was a complement or something. I  really didn't feel like I had anyone on my side, and still don't.\n\nRight  now, when I'm not at work, my fun consists of going to my mothers house  to be in the company of another person. I am so sick of this endless,  funless, cycle I'm in, and I don't know when it will end. I always have a  little bit of hope that things will get better, but that hope is  fading.\n\nI do however, have one  hobby I really enjoy. I have always loved music, and am currently  learning to play guitar and piano. Almost everyday I imagine, creating a  cool song, and playing in front of people, and hearing them say, \"He's a  pretty cool guy!\" But that's probably just a dream.\n\nI'm  at the point now where I crave any human interaction I can get. I might  take my time grocery shopping, hoping I might be able to be brave and  strike up a conversation with a stranger. But it never happens. When my  phone goes off my heart skips a beat hoping someone might be asking to  hang out, but it's just my mother texting me about something I don't  care about. I recently got a two bedroom apartment because there were a  few people I know that want to get a roommate. I asked them if they'd  live with me, they said they would, but they all backed out. So now I  have a bigger lonelier apartment all to myself.\n\nI  just don't know what to do at this point. I'm so lost. I have no  memories to look back upon, nobody to go to when I'm having a bad day,  and depression is taking away my one enjoyment which is music. The  future seems scary to me. I don't know why all this is happening to me, I  want to know what friendship is like, what love is like. There's  obviously wrong with me. I'm a good looking guy, I have a steady job,  I'm nice, respectful, and trustworthy. All I know is this loneliness is  killing me. I have so much to offer, but no one to share life  experiences with. It really hurts me when I hear people talk about crazy  things they've done with their friends, and I do my best to hold back  my tears because the things they talk about are things I have only  dreamed of doing, but to them it's just another Friday night.\n\nIt seems like there is nothing I can do and no way out.", "subreddit": "lonely"}

Now no one has called me that before, so my first reaction was \"why\" but I didn't tell her that. \n\nI'm really worried that my own self doubts will lead to me subconsciously sabotaging this friendship because I don't think I'm worth anyone's time. \n\nCan anyone relate? How does one even start to deal with this ?", "subreddit": "lonely"}

{"post_id": "cy2lkc", "created_utc": 1567293881, "title": "Are we really ugly?", "author": "DrTootie", "self_text": "Hey guys and gals, I\u2019m new to the forums and have read a lot about people thinking they\u2019re ugly. I have believed this since I was 10 and am 29 now. I did not lose my virginity until I was 24 and there were so many drugs involved I can\u2019t even remember it. I had one relationship when I was 27 but I was never attracted to her and only did it because I thought I\u2019d never have another chance. I personally suffer from terrible body dysmorphia from when I was overweight when I was younger. This ultimately started my thinking of how ugly I was.\n\nI grew up in LA going to school with celebrity kids and was surrounded by beautiful people. I have so many things I hate about myself that stemmed from comparing myself to them. I avoid mirrors because I am disgusted by my eyebrows, eye color, big Jewish nose, weak jaw line, my minor track marks from my drug addiction, and my chin. It literally eats me up alive all day everyday. The thing is, never once have I been told any of these things are ugly. Fat was the only thing I\u2019ve heard and it was from one person when I was 13. However, that one person is the only thing I can ever recall when I consider my appearance.\n\nI have had many people tell me I\u2019m attractive but i can\u2019t ever seem to internalize it. I am very health conscious and am in good shape but still feel fat. I work in sales and know that I must not be too repulsive because I am one of our top salesman and I know that should mean I\u2019m at least welcoming. I have quite a few female friends tell me I\u2019m attractive though none of them will date me so I think it\u2019s bullshit.\n\nThrough over a decade of therapy I know that I have many thought distortions and try to challenge them with logic. Logic would dictate that I\u2019m not as ugly as I feel but I still never believe it. \n\nMy question to y\u2019all is do a lot of you suffer from this as well. It\u2019s so easy for us to consider ourselves the ugliest person in the world through our minds eye but is it actually true? Not having success in relationships so far seems to reinforce that we must be ugly but there are other repairable factors for finding a relationship.  I say this with many struggles doin myself, but we should all look at the complete truth of this belief. How are we determining this to be true and is it actually the whole truth?\n\nI know it\u2019s so fucking easy to be hard on ourselves and beat ourselves up for looks because we are not \u201cplayers\u201d but is what we see in ourselves actually the same as how we view ourselves? I would say in most cases we are exponentially more critical and unfair to ourselves despite positive evidence that we are ok. I don\u2019t know any of you but I do love all of you because I understand the struggle and the pain. Everyone has something that is beautiful to others and I urge you do challenge any thought telling you otherwise.\n\n\ud83e\udd70", "subreddit": "ForeverAlone"}
