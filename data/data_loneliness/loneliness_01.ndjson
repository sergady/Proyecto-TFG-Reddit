So far my birthday has consisted of me being scolded for being sad and then crying while trying to fall asleep to the sound of the fireworks. All my friends had other plans so I'm alone. I don't always relate to what people on this subreddit say but if there was ever a time, it's now. I've thought about various things while trying to fall asleep. I wondered if I had borderline personality disorder considering I just learnt more about the differences between that, DID(I think it's called now) and bipolar. I imagined my past if I was a different person where everything was infinitely better. I thought about how I want it to be over but I don't want to die. Like not wearing a seatbelt on purpose so that on the off chance I crash it's done. I'm scared of pain. I thought about how I might have delusions of hopelessness. The key word is delusions because I'm not sure if I'm useless and capable of nothing or if that's not real. In my mind literally everyone else is capable of so much. It's just something about ME. I thought about how selfish I am because I only ever think about myself. I'm not selfish in general just when it comes to thinking about things. I would like to help people in the future and I daydream about it but I know I'll never be in that position. I can't remember what else I thought about so far.

I forgot about the brief moments where I realised how amazingly complex life is. How you can't truely fathom whether or when there's anything to expect from life. When you try to grasp how complex the universe is, you know that whatever you are grasping, it doesn't do it justice. Our minds are just a part of the complexity. Our bodies are ever renewing, you're walking around in a completely new body of cells at least every 10 years. Time, the past and the future are concepts, time is truely and honestly an everlasting now. And new years is actually just another day, as someone on tv pointed out just now.

Lets get started .. \n\nI wanna talk. to you today about the power of imagining.  So far everybody is picturing the wrong outcome. It\u2019s easy to say \u201cwell 420, good things never happen to me and never will\u201d but here\u2019s the good news. As long as we can imagine things, we might as well imagine a better situation. See, to imagine means to visualize. Even though we can\u2019t see change with our normal eyes, we can still visualize it. Without vision there is no victory. \n\nFor example, I thought I was gonna be \u201cFA\u201d because I was getting friend zoned, laughed at, insulted, and embarrassed by all the girls. Then I noticed the girls I had a crush on would wrap their arms around my friends and kiss on them. It was then I decided to picture myself kissing the girls and holding them. No matter how bad the girls treated me I still visualized a girl wrapping her arms around me and kissing me one day. \n\nWell one day the \u201cnew girl in school\u201d showed up on campus. She was beautiful mixed with black, hawaiian &amp; samoan and guys were all over her.  \nFlash forward to prom season. My friends asked me \u201care you going to prom?\u201d &amp; I laughed and said \u201cyeah right, who would wanna go with my ass?\u201d I then pointed to the new girl and sarcastically said \u201c I\u2019m gonna go with her\u201d \n\nFlash forward a couple weeks I noticed the new girl had a cute friend that I knew from mutual people. So I asked her to prom, well a week later she said her mom wouldn\u2019t let her. The new girl over heard us talking &amp; said \u201cif she can\u2019t go with you, then I\u2019ll go with you\u201d I couldn\u2019t believe she said that! \n\nAs prom was getting closer we actually kept in touch with each other &amp; planning the event. When it came I went with one of my pals and everybody told me I had the finest prom date. By the end of the night we kissed but not like I imagined yet. We remained friends and she would greet me with a kiss everytime she saw me. One night we were hanging out smoking fatties and drinking. She said \u201c420 I never gotta chance to kiss the shit outta you on prom night\u201d &amp; then she said \u201cyou mind if I make up for it?\u201d \nThat\u2019s when she wrapped her arms around &amp; kissed the shit outta me like Wow!! lots of tongue action and gently biting on my lower lip. It was so amazing. I was so hard afterwords I went home with blueballs lol. When I went to bed that night I realized everything I imagined and visualized came true.  \n\nWhat am I saying??? ..

It feels like glass shards in my stomach. I don\u2019t tell my \u201cfriends\u201d how I wish they would include me in the hang outs after school, because they lack understanding and would only ostracize me further. I don\u2019t tell my sister who majors in psychology, because I feel like she wouldn\u2019t know what to say which would only leave me feeling more alone than I was before. She\u2019s home for the holidays so we\u2019re sharing a room. Thankfully, I don\u2019t think she can hear me crying. I don\u2019t tell my parents, because they would weep because they think they failed at raising me. I don\u2019t want them to think they failed raising me, I want them to be proud of me. I don\u2019t tell anyone, no one gets to see, no one gets to hear, no one gets to know. No one gets to help. So I help myself. Or at least I\u2019m trying. I try so hard at making a change to my life but nobody knows how much I struggle. I\u2019m really good at my poker face. And I can never seem to stop myself from crying. I don\u2019t like crying in front of other people, so I don\u2019t unless I choose to let myself. I\u2019ve cried so many nights it feels like each tear burns my cheek. My face feels raw. I don\u2019t tell. I don\u2019t even get bullied at school and I don\u2019t self harm or anything, the reason I\u2019m sad is because I\u2019m completely overlooked, I also feel like I don\u2019t even deserve to cry because worse things exist. People get raped, people lose loved ones, people get paralyzed and I wanna cry because I\u2019m fucking lonely? I feel like a jerk just by being sad because my problems don\u2019t fucking matter compared to the actual, real, horrible things that exist. But I still can\u2019t stop myself from crying. Every time I\u2019ve tried to open up to someone close to me, I realize as I\u2019m talking that they aren\u2019t listening. So I shut up. I hate feeling lonely all the time and I hate the thought of demanding attention like, \u201cMe, me, ME! I\u2019m a sad fucking pity party! Pay attention to my problems! Oh? There are people dying all around the world? Who cares because I\u2019m sad!\u201d No. I refuse to be a selfish asshole. So, I don\u2019t tell anyone. Actually, this is the first time I\u2019ve communicated these thoughts somewhere other than inside my own head. That\u2019s the reason I made this Reddit account. I\u2019ve tried everything to keep from feeling alone except for talking about it online. But only online, no one gets to know in my personal life. So no one knows. I just can\u2019t let them know. No one gets to see, hear, or help me. So I\u2019m trying to fix it myself. Everyone thinks I\u2019m so strong, my \u201cfriends\u201d actually come to me for help with their emotional problems. So I don\u2019t bother anyone with my issues. But, sometimes... I really wish someone knew. I know this is going to sound super fucking pathetic, but, please comment or anything. I would really appreciate it, I just feel so alone right now. And sorry for the swearing, I try not to online cause it bothers some people but I couldn\u2019t help myself during this post. I don\u2019t reveal my age online so all I\u2019m going to say is that I\u2019m young. So I\u2019m trying really hard not to be edgy, cringey, or dramatic, because I\u2019m dead serious. I really am lonely. No one knows, except you. And yes I really do want you to leave a comment. Please I want to know if there is anyone else out there like me.", "subreddit": "lonely"}

In this post: [https://www.reddit.com/r/ForeverAlone/comments/ab5n1z/welp\\_im\\_gonna\\_do\\_it/](https://www.reddit.com/r/ForeverAlone/comments/ab5n1z/welp_im_gonna_do_it/), I committed to said exercise, in addition to outlining some parameters. The following post comprises my first such account, my account of the night of 01/01/2019.\n\nWell, I was nervous throughout the entire day. Eventually, unable to take it anymore, I decided to just go out and get it over with. It was pretty early (only 5:15 PM), but I couldn\u2019t stand to be so wound up any longer. So I showered, put on deodorant, combed by hair, shaved, brushed my teeth, applied facial products and changed into nicer clothes. I stalled quite a bit (fussed over my hair, did a few last-minute household chores, picked a bar that was quite far away), and ended up leaving at 6:15. During the walk, I calmed down quite a bit (it was a lovely evening), but, alas\u2026\n\n\u2026when I got there, the bar was closed. (Despite my phone having explicitly stated that it was open). But hey, nevermind, the bar was in the middle of the CBD, so I\u2019d be able to find another one, no problemo, right? Alas, no. I wandered around, but almost every other bar was closed too. I found *one* which was open \u2013 one I rather liked, to boot \u2013 but, strange thing, it was *completely* deserted, with no one, not even so much as a bartender, inside. The only places which were open were places which were really more restaurants than bars \u2013 there were few, if any, single women within such places, and even if there had been any, I wouldn\u2019t have been comfortable approaching a woman who was in the middle of eating dinner. I wandered around for three hours, but the story was the same everywhere, and eventually my legs started to ache, and so\u2026 I went home, empty-handed.\n\n\\*sigh\\*. Great start, eh? At least I was defeated by an inability to find a bar in the first place, rather than an inability to approach.\n\nI do believe, however, that this experience has taught me that I may need to modify my strategy a bit. The simple facts of the matter are that most bars aren\u2019t open, and that most people don\u2019t go out to bars, on weekdays. (Indeed, one commenter on my previous post had warned me about this). This leaves me, I believe, with three options:\n\n* The first option is that I attempt to approach women in places other than bars (i.e\u2026 the park, the shop). I am highly uncomfortable about doing this. Most women, I suspect, go to bars with an understanding that men might hit on them there, but strongly dislike it when men do this at other venues whilst they\u2019re just trying to go about their day.\n* The second option is that I approach three women on Fridays, three on Saturdays, and three on Sundays, the days when people *do* go out to bars, for the four weekends of January. (And only writing an account of those nights). If I managed to do this, I\u2019d have approached 36 women, which is actually slightly more than I\u2019d approach if I only approached one on each day. I have serious doubts, however, about my ability to approach three women on a given night.\n* The third option is that I only approach one woman on Fridays, one on Saturdays, and one on Sundays, over the course of however many months it takes. I find it doubtful, however, that I\u2019d get good at approaching if I did it this sparingly.\n\nI think I\u2019ll just give myself a kick in the bum, and go with the second option. I reckon I could do it if I really, *really* tried. Sorry, folks, for what I imagine is a pretty uninspiring initial account. I have a feeling that this is gonna be a learning experience. I guess you can expect my next account in a few days\u2019 time.\n\nAgain; ***polite***, ***constructive***, ***good faith*** suggestions are appreciated.", "subreddit": "ForeverAlone"}

I avoid them because I can't deal with them. when we talk, we fight. and when they see me they latch onto me and start either 1. bombarding me with questions I don't\u00a0want to answer or 2. asking me to do things for them or 3. reprimanding me on being a bad daughter and comparing me to all the other great daughters all their friends have. so, yes, I go as far as pretending to be sick to avoid them.\n\nBack to my new year's eve, I stayed in bed watching lame Netflix shows and playing a mobile game. which by the way no one was online because they all had new year plans and parties, while sad little old me sat in her bed playing the game all by my lonesome.\u00a0\n\n**Why aren't I at a party or watching fireworks with my friends?**\u00a0\n\nsimple. because my parents won't let me.

We've hung out together several times in the past and we're quite well familiar with one another. Life has taken a toll on us as of late and we've been pretty busy--we attempt to catch up through text, phone calls, or any sort of interaction. However, I noticed that all of a sudden she unfollowed me on Instagram. Mind you, I usually don't care whenever someone unfollows me, but this is a dear friend of mine that I'm very well acquaintanced with, especially on social media, and for her to unfollow me just like that left me stunned.\n\nAt first, I thought it was unintentional on her part and I even reached out to her by text yesterday if everything was alright... I have yet to receive a reply from her. Instead, apparently, she had more time to upload an Instagram story, but for some reason can't find a second to get back to me?\n\nI can t think of anything that I might've done to anger her as of late and I have no idea what's going on since she won't let me know.\n\n__________________________\n\nThis isn't the first time that something similar of this nature had occurred before. Last March we just stopped talking to each other for a while and I'll admit that I was at fault in this situation. I was dealing with personal problems at the time, leaving me in crummy moods, and I stopped talking to her all around. I should've been more considerate of her.\n\nShe expressed her anxiety on social media and how our \"classmates pushed her away from the group.\" I wonder if by \"classmates\" she was referring to me specifically...or maybe I'm just being egocentric. I replied to her post, and again, doesn't reply back. I felt bad for ghosting her out and I'm over here making the effort trying to repair our relationship that I had prompt, but she's won't cooperate. I thought she had gotten over me, thus, I sent a message that maybe it was time to split up. It wasn't worth fighting for someone if they weren't willing to do the same.\n\nTwo hours later, she finally replied back and pinpointed the blame on me for leaving her. Of course, I acknowledged my own fault and we were able to make everything work afterwards. But, she wasn't exactly innocent in this circumstance either. If she truly cared, why didn't she make the profound effort of fixing our friendship along with me? Why did it take a break-up message for her to finally come to her senses? Why didn't she reach out to me in some measure of empathy or concern just as I have in the past and very recently?\nLast month, we finally got around to seeing each other again and had fun hanging out together. There wasn't a single sign of friction between us--just two friends catching up in their friendship. So I don't understand what set her off this time that made her unfollow me or why she's blatantly ignoring me.\n\n__________________________\n\nShe admitted that she has pushed a number of people away from her life, both intentionally and unintentionally. Maybe I'm one of the unlucky ones. Maybe she doesn't want to be with me anymore. I unfollowed her this morning and I'm kind of regretting my decision. Maybe I should've stuck around and try to comprehend the state of her enigma and work something out once again. ...or maybe that's it between us. I doubt she's going to want to do anything to restore our friendship... she didn't fight for us before, and most likely she won't fight for us again. In the end, I guess I'm just not worth it for her and I should just accept this and move on.", "subreddit": "lonely"}

Not because she had said anything, but because of the lack of anything being said. Things got a bit rough between us before she left for basic, and I thought that the few weeks that we had completely apart would help to mend and heal that break that we had. I was incredibly optimistic in terms of hanging out together she came back for HBL, and it was honestly one of the only things that I was holding onto to keep myself going for the last few months. Once she got back however, I quickly realized that everything I had hoped for was nowhere to be found. We had planned to take a trip to Chicago with some other people sometime while she was back, that got delayed since she got busy around Christmas, which was understandable. I asked if we could push it back to Friday, thinking that it would give her enough time to make the plans, but there were never any plans made, almost as if she had just given up on them completely. On top of this, I had told her a while before she came back that if she had wanted to do anything to just let me know so that I could call off of work and not have it interfere with anything. I called off that Wednesday, meaning I probably lost around $50 by not working, all for absolutely nothing to happen. It took me constantly nagging her to figure something out before she decided to invite me over to her house on Friday night. It seemed like I was finally going to be able to spend some time with her, but almost everything made it seem like she really didn\u2019t want me there, and only invited me to get me to shut up. She told me to come later, even though there were already people there. Then she hardly even talked to me the whole night. I wasn\u2019t even there for that long either. I was hoping to be there until like 11 or 12, but she made me leave at 10 because she was getting breakfast with a ton of other people the next morning.

I mainly use reddit as a source for venting, so I just want to get all of this off my chest.  \nIt don't really know when it started, I've had anxiety for as long as I can remember, but the depression started in the begining of 2018, I remember I met a girl I really liked on this app to make friends for all of the hip and cool teens (*as you can tell, I didn't have that many friends considering I had this app*)  so, I talked to her and we had the same intrests and life seemed to be going upwards, but oh boy was i wrong.  \n\n\nSo there I was, having played some overwatch with her for a while, I decided to do something that I didn't really think through. We had this running joke that we would make a bet that someone would get that many kills or get play of the game and ect. and the thing was that we both really liked ice tea. I don't anymore because it makes me think of her but thats beside the point. so if the person one the bet they'd add it to the amount of ice teas the other person owed them. (*this is a needlesly comeplicated and small thing to say but it leads up to something bigger*) \n\nSo this one time she owed me like 3 bottles of ice tea and I told her that i'd come over and collect it from her in a litle bit, she didn't belive me but I was already dedicated to escalating this dumb joke of ours to the next level. But there was one thing. She lived an hour away in a different city. Now my dumb, borderline idiotic idea was to tell my parents i was visiting another friend who lived in my town, Then cycle my way to another near by town 40 minutes away on bike (*our town doesn't have a train station*), take the train to her city, hang out with her for a bit, and leave again. Now long story short I was about to miss the train, i called my mom, told her the truth and she drove me to the train station, I met up with her, she took the buss home. THEN the first bad thing happened, I panicked and didn't go on the right train home. I was in a city I had never been to before, my phone had died, it was dark outside, and I had missed my train home. I built up the courage to ask this friendly looking lady if I can quickly borrow her phone to call my mom. But then she declined. I was panicking at this point. one of my worst fears had come true and I had no idea what to do, I went to a store seeing if I could buy a charger, I tried to get the littlest amount of battery from my phone to kick into action so I could call home. but after what seemed like walking around, panicking and almost crying for what seemed like an eternity, the lady I had originally asked saw me fiddling with my phone and aloud me use it to call my mom. I don't think i ever have, nor ever will be as luckt because the lady I asked, was a cop. I felt the safest I had in ages. A cop was sitting with me waiting for almost an hour for my mom to arrive so that I can finally go home.  \n\n\nThat event is something I don't think I'll ever forget.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMe and my friend, lets call her Nina. So me and Nina talked and played together after that, but after that was when I really started to get depressed\n\n\\----TRIGGER WARNING AHREAD----\n\nI started to cut myself, I had never done it before this and I have been clean since july but that time was really fucking rough  \n\\----TRIGGER WARING OVER----\n\nI dont know if that was uneccersery but I wanted to be sure so I put the warning in.  \nI didn't have any friends, and the ones I did have, Nina made me cut ties with.  \n\n\nThe next time we hung out was this sleep over we had when my dad wasn't home and it has many good and horrible memories.  \n\n\nThrough all of this there was the running \"joke\" that I liked her, because in a truth or dare she asked me who i liked ( we were very bored ) and I said her.  \n\n\nwe also went to a convention together, se was mad at me for not wanting to go to a lot a places in the convetion center, which I told er before hand would be hard for me because of my social anxiety  \n\n\nWe kinda lost touch after that.  \nshe has a boyfriend now.  \nI still have't had a girlfriend.  \nShe invited me to play  overwatch like a month after we stopped talking. after like 3 minutes her boyfriend joins and they talk about how much they love each other.  \n\n\nI kinda used up all my energy on that super long paragraph, its 2am now  \n\n\noh yeah I forgot to talk about school and how far behind i am and just how much I hate it so much and how I have no friends left there and am seriously considering being homeschooled or something because thinking about school is making me panic and  school starts in a day and I dont know what to do and I'm trying not to sleep and distract myself from that so that it takes me time for school to come  \n\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm sorry about all the grammar mistakes and how a lot of this doesn't make sense, english isn't my first language and I'm very tired  \n\n\nthank you for reading  \ni might update more as I come up with more info or get more energy", "subreddit": "lonely"}

Throwaway acc.\n\nThroughout the past couple of years, I have noticed a downward spiral of my physical desire for somebody. For example, I had been seeing this girl for a short amount of time recently and while I genuinely enjoyed her company &amp; had feelings for her, I couldn't bring myself to have sex with her when I was given the opportunity. \n\nI wanted to but I didn't want to.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n(Sorry if this is confusing lmao)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI left feeling embarassed and I could tell she was hurt but I just couldn't explain it to her when I tried. I kept looking for something but I couldn't think of anything because *I* can't even figure out the reason why. \n\nI told her it probably was some combination of anxiety, my last relationship, and medication.\n\nWe ended up drifting apart and this had made me realize that this is happening to every girl I have any sort of feelings for. I haven't had any sort of actual relationship in two years now. \n\nI take a lot of medication, one of which I know alters my sex drive, but it doesn't feel like the way it did when the meds had that sort of effect on me. \n\nThe thought of sex with her feels dirty. \n\nWrong.\n\nWhen I truly want to be with someone on a deeper level than physical, I just haven't been able to bring myself to enjoy it. It's never a problem when it's just a hookup and because of that, I'm afraid I'm developing a negative association with sex. \n\nI had an incredibly long &amp; problematic relationship two years ago and I know that has *something* to do with it, but I don't know why the issue seems to be getting worse. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMakes me feel pretty lonely, honestly.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSorry, new year feels are still getting to me.

He's been guiding me through my career and he treatsme well. I'm really grateful for a friend like him to be honest. Compare to shitty childhood and past I would say my life is currently at its best point because he lend me a hand in many ways. I'm by no means success but at least I don't have to worry about food and shelter anymore.\n\nFast forward to Christmas he invited me to a trip because he told me he was going alone and was looking for a companion. Lo and behold he at the last minute his girlfriend decides to join in and I'm the third wheel for a 3 days 2 night trip. He did apologize though.\n\nI told myself I'll be fine with it but the longer it is, the more hatred I feel towards my friend. This is the first time I've ever felt hatred towards someone who helped me pull my shitty life togather. We are at mall with a huge plaze and as the clock strike twelve all the couple in front of me started hugging and kissing so does my friend. I do not know how but somehow I manage to find a corner spot just to witness all of that in front of me. It's usual for me and I don't think much of it.\n\nAfter the celebration settles down a bit I was alone sitting at somewhere and begin thinking about the entire trip so far. Suddenly I felt tears dripping from my eyes as I'm thinking to myself. Weirdly enough I did not feel any rage like before. I am crying but for the first time I have this feeling. It was nothing, no joy or anger just peaceful serene. Perhaps it is at this moment I've accepted this status of my life at \"fate\". All the resentment I've felt earlier seems so petty. Am I wrong to feel hate and anger? Thankfully my culture didn't put much emphasize on the Christmas festival during my upbringing otherwise this would be the worst holiday ever.\n\nThanks for taking the time to read and I apologize for bad phrasing and word choice. My mind is still kind of in shambles as I type this. Happy holidays and may you all fare better than me.\n\n", "subreddit": "ForeverAlone"}

You pay a woman to do things couples do like go to the park, maybe go out to dinner together but like I said, not an escort since there isn't sex. Maybe she would sell the experience of going to the movie theater with a girlfriend and you could hold her hand during the movie.

And I'm glad it's over. But this year I decided to myself I will fight out of this loneliness from last year. So I thought to myself, \"I need to come to my senses\", first thing that came in my mind afterwards was \"I'm already lonely enough, I should just remove the bad people in my life as well\".\nAnd on the new year I finally got rid of the person to blame for the loneliness I've been going through in 2018.\nI'm talking about this one guy who I was been friends with for over a year. I've always brought him around all the places where I was, around the people I socialized with. That was the biggest mistake I could ever make, for he is more social than me. So of course he would start talking to the people I was talking to, and he'd be talking to them more than me because he was more social. Now because of this guy, I've lost a great majority of my friends because afterwards they started giving a shit about him more and later they forgot about me. By the middle of 2018 I was left with only two of my good friends (that I still have luckily). All the other ~11+ I had were completely gone from my life because of this guy, which was still friends with all those I've lost. \nBut I could never realize I was getting so lonely because of him for the entire year. Worst thing is, I was such a fool to fall in love with him. We dated for less than a day, and of course he dumped me, because I'm \"not serious enough\". He barely even asked me to show him my serious side (that I don't show to everybody),,ever. \nBut now, in the new year, he's gone. Forever from my life. Gone. And I don't want to see him ever again. \nEvery time I tried to get rid of him, blocking him on social media and whatever (we were online friends afterall) he sent his friends after me, telling me to unblock him and whatever. Just so that they leave me alone I always accepted the request and make up a jack shit excuse to him to avoid embarrassment.\nHe's doing the same right now. But this time I'm not going to respond at all. He can keep begging to have me back again to keep his ego filled up but I'm not here for his bullshit anymore. He even thinks the fact that we dated (for less than a day, mind you) is a good enough reason to keep me around him. He takes my friends away from me, dumps me in less than a day after being starved of anyone's love for so long, and he expects me to still want to be his friend? Not anymore. It's over. He's gone from my life. Thanks to this now I have some way better friends. \n\nIn conclusion, maybe you guys also have few friends right now, but make sure to rule out those who are a bad influence on you from your life.

But it upsets me mainly because of what i have seen from social media and how death is now used as almost like a way to get 'likes' and sympathy? I'm sure some of you know what I mean, it's a disingenuous mourning that is more about the person that is still alive. I do not have social media anymore but I would see it relatively often back when i did have it. It makes me really angry that some people would just pretend to be upset over my death for their own ego when they could have just occasionally checked up on me and asked how things are going. But maybe it's on me and I have not been a good enough friend or been an interesting enough person for people to care, I really don't know. Anyway sorry for the ramble, Camus sort of discusses what I'm trying to say in *The Fall* but in a more eloquent way:\n\n\n\u2018...friendship is absent-minded or at least unavailing. It is incapable of achieving what it wants. Maybe, after all, it doesn't want enough? Maybe we don't love life enough? Have you noticed that death alone awakens our feelings? How we love the friends who have just left us? How we admire those of our teachers who have ceased to speak, their mouths filled with earth! Then the expression of admiration springs forth naturally, that admiration they were perhaps expecting from us all their lives. But do you know why we are always more just and more generous toward the dead? The reason is simple. With them there is no obligation. They leave us free and we can take our time, fit the testimonial in between a cocktail party and a nice little mistress, in our spare time, in short. If they forced us to anything, it would be remembering, and we have a short memory. No, it is the recently dead we love among our friends, the painful dead, our emotion, ourselves after all!\u2019\n\n\n\n", "subreddit": "lonely"}

It seems like I've got friendzoned once more. You know what's even worse than knowing no girls at all? Having a lot of female friends and never having a girlfriend. I was once in some wierd form of \"unofficial\" relationship that wasn't relationship at all, she told her friend that she might be with me but always called me a friend when I tried to make a move, or was too afraid when some opportunity with her showed up (which was propably fake tbh). But let's forget her, I've learned a lot and improved myself. So now I started going on an university, and there's one girl that I didn't even consider girlfriend material at first, but then when we get to know each other she started to show obvious signs that she's interested, and I'm glad that I didn't make a move, because her friend wanted to help me with her and ask her what she's thinking about me. And she told her that she doesn't look for a boyfriend now and treats me as good buddy, which equals friendzone with zero chances in the future isn't it? It annoys the hell out of me, I'm not desperate, I'm not ugly, hell her friend told me that I'm pretty, funny and social guy and would kiss me and drag me into bed if she didn't have a boyfriend, so I'm pretty good boyfriend material right? I'm going to a lot of parties, get to know a lot of new people and have no problems with interacting with strangers but every time it seems that I just can't cross this border between friend and boyfriend, and I don't know why. The worst thing is, that most girls that I get to know are taken. I'm more and more convinced that I'm just destined to be live forever, never experiencing, love, relationship, kissing and having my own family.

{"post_id": "abuvdp", "created_utc": 1546446372, "title": "It's summer and I feel so lonely", "author": "starlessn1ght_", "self_text": "It's been about 20 days since summer break started and so far I've done almost nothing for fun. I'm a 18-year-old Computer Science student with no friends.\n\nYou know, I really wish I could go back to when I was a kid or a teenager. Back when Fridays were the best thing ever every week. Back when my family and I rented a movie from a local rental store and watched it together on Saturdays. Back when we took trips to the coast with my cousins during summer. Back when Ben 10 was airing, plus tons of other awesome cartoons. Back when my grandma was still alive. Back when my cousin would come back from America and we wouldn't stop asking him about life there. Back when we played those cool 2D platform games on our uncle's PC. Back when my sister and I fought like cat and dog but at least we talked to each other. Back when parties were fun. Back when at the beginning of every year everything would go back to the way it was before.\n\nBut I also would do things differently. Back then I still had trouble making friends. I've never had a sleepover at my house or slept at a friend's house. I've never studied together with my friends for finals. My summers weren't that fun either, as I didn't have many friends to spend time with.\n\nStill, it was much better than today. Even though I didn't have actual friends, my school always felt very homey. Everyone knew each other in the class and the teachers also knew us. Each one had their perks and that's why it was such a fun and comfy environment. I liked all of them, really.\n\nIn High School it was also fun having people to talk about anime and TV shows. Not only at school, but I also posted regularly on some pretty cool forums, where I also felt a sense of camaraderie. It was a period full of hardships, to be honest, but it was not in any way boring.\n\nI used to think I didn't need other people to be happy, that I could have fun alone and \"friends\" weren't my things. But how wrong I was. All I wish I had now was a fun gang with whom I could embark on exciting adventures, a group that always sticked together and whose members were always there for each other. I know it sounds silly, but I don't care, I'm just saying how I wanted things to be.\n\nBack then people also weren't so polarized, politically speaking. Nowadays political discussions are filled with rage, irrationality and name-calling. The other day I saw a kid wearing a shirt with a politician's face printed on it, which I found really sick. I'm trying my best to avoid any kind of political discussion, for the sake of my mental health. You know, your political ideology was just supposed to be your opinion on how to make the world a better place and not if you're on the good or bad side.\n\nAnyway, college has been pretty boring so far and so has summer. Not the nonchalant, chill kind of boring, more like the lonely, depressing kind of boring. Every subject has a different class, so most of the times we don't even know each other. Our teachers don't know our names. There's much less interaction, it's definitely not a \"fun\" environment, like school was. You don't see people pranking each other before class begins, you don't hear people laughing out loud like they've just heard the funniest thing in their entire life, and I no longer have those quirky and heartwarming interactions I had with my classmates.\n\nI think I've also become a very boring person with time. I don't have much to say most of the times, I hate going out, I hate parties, I hate beaches. All the people make me feel uncomfortable. I'm also finding it harder and harder to like things I loved before, like cartoons, movies, TV shows, etc.\n\nYou know, I really like what I'm studying in college, but to be honest I'm not looking forward to adulthood. If life is so lonely now, it'll probably be even worse when I'm working. No matter how much I try to imagine a different future, it still looks very bleak compared to how my school years could be.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThank you for reading this.", "subreddit": "ForeverAlone"}

It was a great decision on a dozen levels.\n\nAs an adult I have moved constantly, probably too much really.  Sometimes it has been a mistake and it is always an adventure, but the great thing is that basically no one knows anything about you when you show up in a new city.\n\nYou get judged on what you say and do not where you went to school or that incident as a freshman in high school.  In the old days people just lied.  It was actually a great American tradition.\n\nEver wonder why so many people traveled West in the old days?  Well, for a lot of them it was because they went bankrupt in Ohio or Alabama.  Sam Houston left Tennessee because his wife rejected him and maybe ridiculed him.  He had a wound on his lower abdomen from the Battle of Horseshoe Bend that never healed right. It was apparently pretty gross and he might not have been able to perform sexually.  Anyhow, he was the governor of Tennessee at the time, but he was so humiliated by the incident he left the state and never spoke of the woman again.\n\nThis is another option ruined by the internet.  For instance, I knew a guy in college who claimed to have been a small town football hero to everyone he met.  He was hundreds of miles from home and he was pretty athletic.  He told great stories.\n\nA few years after I graduated I met someone from his hometown who graduated high school with him and he looked shocked when I mentioned xxxxxx's football heroics.  He said something like, \"No, he lived in a trailer down by the river and cut firewood with his old man every single day.  I heard the principal had to go out with a deputy sheriff a couple of times to make sure the old man knew he would be arrested if xxxxx missed too many days of school.\"\n\nI nearly fell over.  Being a football hero was such a part of this guy's persona.  But the firewood business explained his football player build and I understood a lot more about him after learning this.\n\nToday you cant simply make up a new history for yourself like that guy did, but you do control what your new community thinks about you. For me it was great.  For my long lost friend who escaped from his redneck hell cutting firewood for his old man it must have been better and it worked out pretty good for Sam Houston too.\n\n(Edit)  I have lived overseas most of the last four years, mostly in the Philippines, South Africa, and Ukraine.  And really until I moved overseas I had no idea how great it could be to escape American culture.  ", "subreddit": "ForeverAlone"}

I haven't been in a single relationship, I haven't even had a first kiss. I'm invisible to my family. So invisible in fact that I they often make plans and go out without me, fully knowing I'm there with them.  \n\n In high school and trade school, I was known as the \"nice guy\".  I'd share my snacks and movies to those girls  I considered friends though we've never hung out at all outside of school. They would just come to me for my snacks then do their own thing.  I'd rarely get a hug from them.  One day when one girl seemed distressed and upset, I offered advice and an open ear if she wanted to talk.  I was told by one of my male friends that the distressed girl called me annoying and ugly. She refused to acknowledge me after that day i found out.\n\nAfter high school and trade school, I've tried talking to girls. Though I only got ignored or stared at. I continued being invisible. I stopped trying to get a girl's attention. What's the point? There's no point. \n\nSure I've met a girl in college she seems to have her future planned out and everything. We have only hung out once outside of school. We were supposed to go to six flags magic mountain as a group of 4 but two of her friends cancelled the last minute so it was just me and her and her mom all day. Unfortunately i ate some bad food the night before and didn't sleep too well and to top it off it was over 102\u00b0f the day of the hangout. Though i was extremely sick and tired, I did my best to let her have the best first time at six flags magic mountain since she's never been before.\n\n Idon't know if she's in a relationship with someone else or not.  It kills me not knowing but she shows absolutely no interest in dating me.  We barely text each other.  I always seem to be initiating conversations with her. I do like her, but I'm sure it's pretty one sided.\n\nI dont know what to do. I feel like there's no hope for me. I've always heard \"that there's someone for everyone\".

It's so weird, i feel disconnected from my emotions and then suddenly it's on overdrive.\n\nThe last year was really good for me- I travelled, kept some amazing friends around, worked on myself, went to therapy, worked on grad school applications, did well at my job.\n\nBut this year, I leave by job at the end of the month with no back up plan, I planned on emigrating to Canada and that doesn't seem like it will pan out (i need a master's degree but i applied to super competitive programs, so dont know if i'll get in just yet) and lost some friends of mine that I thought would be around forever. I started dating again, but all the men i meet just seem interested in having sex with my and vanishing. I'm starting to feel so disconnected from my body, like the sex just feels mechanical now. I just read men and it feels like they have real zero interest, and i try to put my heart into it and be a good person, but it seems almost pointless now.\n\nLast year, I had an epiphany that a guy I knew in high school liked me all through these years even after we left, and i was so blind to it because i was grieving losing my dad the past few years and I had a rough period from 2012-2017 so I didn't pay attention, and now we message each other but i feel like i missed the window. he keeps telling me to come to Japan and meet him, but then he's never consistent with his messaging, and so i'm starting to feel this is a hook up thing again and maybe he just doesnt really like me. I am starting to feel like that with most men. Even though i know i have a lot to offer, it seems that they don't really care about much but sex and once they get that it's thank u next. I'm not complaining when I want a hook up, but it sucks when it's someone you've known well for a while and you feel like that's their agenda too. I had another former classmate call me up on new year drunk (he was hitting on me, but it turns out his gf broke up with him) so again it was just like some weird ego boost thing for him.. and not at all about reconnecting with me.. and that just made me feel like shit. I know I shouldn't engage these people, but i'm so lonely now that i've deluded myself into believing that they want more and i'm just overreacting even when i can sense that it usually means nothing to them.\n\nI also lost some really close friends from high school, because we grew apart and i don't agree with who they are. i feel like a decade older than them. they haven't grown since high school. they're just so mean and shady to everyone, super bigoted and plain stupid. not a good combination and i feel like i cant talk to them anymore. which sucks because they all seem to get along with each other so well, but i feel like i'm so sick of pretending that we're all close when we're... just not. and it sucks because i can't hide what i truly feel in public anymore, so when i'm in a bad group i become distant and don't talk to anyone, and when i'm with one person i feel like i connect better. it's gotten so bad that i just hate being in group hangouts now. I don't like going to weddings (which is where i reconnected with my former high school friends) because i feel like the only mood you can be in a wedding is happy, and i'm just not feeling too happy these days.\n\nA lot in my life is uncertain right now, and all that uncertainly is making me anxious and feeling like i can't breathe. Everytime i talk to friends i feel scared to tell them what's going on, because i feel like they don't really care anyway. like i'll start talking about something for 5 seconds, and they'll bring something of theirs in. I don't even say \"hey i wasn't done!\" anymore. I just convince myself that if they couldn't pay attention to that and so willingly changed the subject of conversation, they just don't care to hear my rambling and blabbering (and possibly complaining, yikes) I am so sick of myself, because i feel like i'm complaining, when really i possibly have nothing to complain about.

But my experience has been somewhat different.  When I was in school, it's true that many people were terrible to me and did not shy away from explaining to me how hideous I am.  But I noticed as I graduated to adulthood that most people generally speaking avoid mentioning anything about sex, relationships, or anything else of that nature within earshot, mostly because they wanted to avoid the awkward discomfort that they knew this line of conversation would bring up.\n\nI think a lot of people find the concept of my being FA to be something uncomfortable and shameful to talk about, not to mention potentially hurtful to me and so they steer clear of it.  Nobody has ever asked me about my wife or my gf, nobody has ever giving me dating advice, or asked me about my future plans for a family because I think know the answers to these questions already.  Not even my own family has asked me or talked to me about this, I think because they know that I am pretty much doomed to a life of solitude.\n\nI think part of the reason my experience may be different is because it is pretty obvious why I am FA to people who see me in person and they realize that there isn't really anything I can do about it.

And I rarely go out in public except for shopping anyways.\n\nOf course, I went without any friends or a SO. I felt awkward riding the light rail alone, walking to the stadium alone, and sitting down in my seat in a sea of Pirates fans, all alone in my Mariners jersey with no SO or friends to talk to. My section was completely packed, but I couldn't socialize with my neighbors if my life depended on it. I was quietly sipping my drink and eating my hot dog and nachos throughout the game, not saying a word to my neighbors. I felt so out of place.\n\nHere's the part that made me feel like a total loser. When I rode the train back and the main Steel Plaza stop came, I walked to the doors to leave. A young woman by herself, probably around my age, wearing Mariners gear - touched my shoulder to get my attention. I quietly mumbled \"Go Mariners\" and walked out. She exclaimed \"That's it???!!!\" and the people around us booed or OOOHHH'd me. I got the fuck out of the station in shame and embarrassment.\n\nOf course, I wasn't expecting to get it on with her or go on a date, but any normal person could - at minimum - strike up a conversation with a fellow fan while exiting the station.

I've always been super introverted and shy, so making friends is hard for me, but not impossible. I had quite a large circle of friends in school, though we've all kind of lost touch at this point, as is the norm for school friends I imagine. They all went to university or something, while I did a media studies course for two years. I hated it and found it difficult to talk to anyone there. I mean, there were some cool people there, but conversations rarely strayed from \"here, look at this meme.\"\n\nSince the course finished, I've pretty much become a hermit. I don't go out very much, nor feel a real need to since there isn't much going on where I live. A lot of my days would be spent just playing video games all day or just browsing Youtube. I eventually tried to be slightly more useful and teach myself new skills, like how to draw and stuff. But almost as soon as I started, I got my first actual job, and don't feel like I have as much time for that stuff. Probably not a big deal, I had no real goal other than to try something different, might pick it up again later. \n\nI thought my job would help me meet people, but it hasn't really so far. There are some cool people there, but either they're twice my age or we get so busy during the day that there's no real time to talk. \n\nThroughout the two or so years I've felt like this, I've had one consistent friend. She lives in America though, so we only communicate online. Lately, she's been getting busier and days go by where we don't talk. And when we do, she usually talks about her own friend circle, which seems to constantly be growing. I'm not mad or jealous about it, just kinda feels bad hearing stories about the good times she has with them, while the highlight of my day is waking up before lunch.\n\nI'm not really sure why I'm posting this.

Hopefully your new years was better than mine.\n\nI'm  22 years  old from Belgium, I have a job that has irregular hours and  pays ok. (train operator) I have social anxiety. Do you know the feeling  when someone looks at you and you're like 'he/she thinks something bad  about me, fuck.'. I have quit my university studies because it wasn't  anything for me (please Belgium government, give the teenagers more  feeling to diffrent jobs) so I followerd my child dream. I have a doggy I  love and I take care of and I live with my dad and brother. I lost my  mother when I was 3 due to cancer. I just feel so lonely a lot of the  times. I feel like I can't connect with anyone. Is this because I never  had a mother to my side? I have had 2 dates with one girl from Germany  but we have lost contact. I'm just so scared to talk to girls. I have  had a bad childhood. I've been bullied since I was 8-15 because I was  overweight. I just ate American brownies and candy because it gave me a  good feeling. At the age of 17, I decided to lose weight and barely ate  anything. I lost 25kg and gotten way skinnier, I had some crushes on  girls in High School and never really went for it because I was too  scared. Now I'm 22, I drink jack daniels and I have gained some weight  again. I don't know what to do... My brother has an eating disorder  (anorexia) and is a control freak. I love playing games and my doggo. My  dad is also very emotional a lot of the times, I love him a lot! Hes  the best! But I know he wants me to have a girlfriend and I know he  wants a granddaughter/son! I just don't know what to do. I really want  kids and have and amazing life with a girl I love, make my dad happy and  help my brother out. I've spend lots of money on charities and games.  Now I have come to the point I need a car for my job because my boss  made me change the location of depot. I feel so down and cant find  happiness without some  alcohol. I really didnt choose this path of  life, I really want to change. I really need some advice. I know I can  find some here. I know, yes I followed my dreams, I love my job! Really I  do!! But when I come home, I walk the dog, and play with her and after  that I play games and drink some beverages. I just feel so empty,  because I have almost nobody to talk to that I can connect with. Yes,  maybe I need some therapy, I have been told that before. But I just  don't believe in that shit. Sorry for the weird post, I know my story  has been told in a weird way, thats just me, enjoy your day.\n\nGreetings,\n\nA lonely friend", "subreddit": "lonely"}

Social anxiety maybe? I'd call it digital social anxiety. Is that a thing?\n\nA couple of months ago my smartphone died. After that, a period to choose my next smartphone began (I'm a techie guy), without any hurry to get in touch again with 'the people'.\n\nThen, after the purchase of my new phone, days were passing, I purchased several apps, some Reddit client, some games, and some productivity apps. But I wasn't brave enough to download and install WhatsApp and face all the remaining, undelivered messages. Not many I guess, as I don't text many people, but there's the fear to face many messages at a time. \n\nThis is the second time that happens to me. Each time my smartphone dies I begin a grace period without social communication. But after some time I have to install it again, and get in touch again. \n\nSome people here may be thinking... Well dude, just don't install WhatsApp or get out of groups of friends you don't feel as friends anymore. \n\nThat's an understandable answer, but I cannot let myself fall into the absolute loneliness, with zero contact with people. So I have to face my social fears and install again WhatsApp... One of this days.\n\nThis story has a nice part, tho. A friend of mine (she got married recently) called to ask how I was, and why didn't get the messages. This is how you tell who cares about you -even if it's just a little-, while my regular friends, the people I know for the past 10 years, haven't called or asked about me. Never. Maybe they are the reason why I don't want to download WhatsApp again... \n\nSorry if this should go into Social Skills subreddit. Maybe I'll post there as well.\n\nTL;DR lonely because I don't want to re-install WhatsApp. Because having that app makes me feel even lonelier.\n\n", "subreddit": "lonely"}

Also gave me the whole great/kind/good guy crap.  I politely said thank you and deleted her number.

Growing up was a mixed bag for me I was pretty smart but I was the second best.  In athletics I was well off but I was just one of the good players. I was also bullied a good portion of my life since I was different in many small ways and kids are cruel. Somewhere along the line I snapped I was only happy berating my past bullies. Eventually it lead to a fight between one of them and me. Nothing really happened but people thought I had really beaten up the other kid. I only had one friend an autistic kid who had no one else and I was fine with this. I joined the running club at this point in middle school. Also it is important to know that my schools are connected K-12 but at different locations so some people leave and join at different times. Running club was great for me I made some friends that liked me for me and I felt good. When it was time to move into high school I choose to go to the connected school even though my friends were going to a different one since I wanted to avoid going to the same school the top student was going to. I broke the records for the entrance exams and was feeling pretty damn good. This lasted about a week cause the top student from my middle school decided last minute he wanted to continue in the charter system and he made my record breaking look like crap. I honestly hated him so much but the one thing I had going for me was that I was smart and pretty good looking considering. I had a girl confess to me in my first semester of high school and this is probably what lead to me becoming a FA. I had decided not to date anyone in this time since one I wanted to go to a good university and two I did not think any of the girls there were worth my time. Yes I am an asshole and I try my best to not be but yeah I suck. I end up becoming friends with the guy since I believed the best people should only group with the best people and well it once again had a small group of friends. Most of these guys were the typical nerds and well I began to pick up theirs habits. Since I no longer had running buddies I did not run and my new friends were a bunch of weebs. I am ashamed to say I was peer pressured into watching anime and I really enjoyed it and still do. Of course this leads to me losing my looks but I did not really care too much since I was meh at best and had not interest in girls at the time. Well I would have been fine if it were not for one girl on the surface she seemed like a typical good diligent girl but something always seemed off about her. A bit of talking over a few semesters and I find out she is like me only choosing to deal with her past by being overly kind and even though I disagreed with that approach we got close. We would keep a normal classmate but we texted each other each week like clockwork. I notice my feelings for her somewhere in junior year and do my best to suppress them since academics are important and shit. A few times I says rude things to her but I treated everyone like shit but it felt wrong with her but it did not bother her too much. She shares things with me that she doesn\u2019t talk about and I do the same. And well I try to hide my feelings and do a good job except one person notices and it the same asshole from before that took my records. I honestly feel like I should include a name but nah. This asshat noticed since he said I do not give a shit when anyone walks by but I seemed a little interested in how she was doing which was a lot in my case. I just settle on making her enjoy her senior year and confessing after graduation cause I became a coward when it come to her. And I see signs that I have a shot with her but I don\u2019t really want anything if we can\u2019t go together to university together and take them as jokes and stuff. I tell her to apply to Ivy\u2019s with me and she says she will not cause her mom won\u2019t let her out of state and we kinda had our first somewhat big fight cause I was concerned about her future when she did not care at all. She tells me that we should go to a school together which is Berkeley since it is ivy level and in California. I said the name since it would be fairly obvious if people want to find out and well this is the only thing I will have specifics of. What do I say no way I am going to a state school. She is mad at me but still responds to my texts but really slowly. I have talked to her about extra curricular activities but she never listened so her essays and grades were going  to  be her strengths. She tells me she will meet me where I am writing my essays so we can go over her our stuff but does not show up and tells me she decided to submit them early cause it was took much work for her to worry about. And similar stuff happened in our senior year but what matters is that I got waitlisted from my schools and go none of them in the end except for fucking Berkeley so I am going there. She got rejected and well goes to school that does not deserve her but well that happened. I eventually did confess and she gives me a soft no which her friends tell me is that she really does not know what we are cause she has hard rejected guys in the past. I was confused and went out with my then best friends telling her how I felt which is unusual for me but I was open with just her. There was some tension between us two from my after party and us almost doing some so she kissed me and I was happy to have someone. This was a lie from the start but I was to stupid to see it. I thought she liked me for me and that was all I cared about since I knew success would bring many women that saw what I had. I should have noticed since she did not want to tell our friends or post anything on social media when she did that with her previous boyfriends and her current one. I was the one that never happened so yeah I have never been a boyfriend but a toy for a girl that wanted attention. This goes on and off with her kinda dumping me but I just need to get her near me and we end up making out. This fake relationship goes on when we both go away for college so we saw each other when we had our winter break. Long story short she keeps string me on for attention and when I am volunteering in another country I crack a bad joke but no unlike my normal ones and she blocks me off everything I messaged her through some weird way and she tells me she is completely done with me as a friend. This hurt so much like I was fine with being a toy I kinda always knew but it felt real for a while and I fought it so hard I tried my best to fix things but long story short I never did. I got really depressed and my grades showed it. I still kinda am my last semester was my worst. I thought I was going to be placed in academic probation since I did shit and well my shit work was barley enough to keep me above it but my gpa has suffered immense damage over a year and well I don\u2019t know what to do with my life now since my intended major has a high gpa requirement. Maybe that why I drink and I drink hard. I have some happiness now and I am getting over it but I can\u2019t really. I am also still a virgin but it is kinda by choice. I could have gotten laid but it has been while drinking and I want to avoid rape accusations. And some while sober but I feel like I am an achievement fuck since I have rejected offers and still talk about that girl I feel for so it might be an ego thing for girls. I want something meaningful and I know fucking would feel good but it would not fill that void. And I can\u2019t do a fake fuck buddy relationship since well I had a fake relationship already and I know how it will end so I can\u2019t really enjoy it. Like want to go back this semester and fuck it seems like a contradiction but it is not since no one cares about me. I will pretend to be someone else and even if I do get laid and shit it won\u2019t be really me. I know people do not care about me I only have one small place I am happy to be in and that somewhat accepts me but I kinda fake it there already. I just want to have someone that really cares about me a friend or more but I am just a person they get along with. I have not made a single friends over the 4 semesters I have been on campus I guess my ex roommate but that\u2019s cause he was kinda forced to live with me. So yeah I have a shitty personality I don\u2019t pretend to be a nice guy. I really am though I care about many people and they talk to me as a person that has it all together when I really don\u2019t. Like some people call me one of their true friends but it is cause i listen to their problems when they are feeling like shit. I help them when they need it but when they are happy no one talks to me like I don\u2019t know what I am. The one good thing is that I still talk to that girl and well things we awkward between us. But talking to her means the world to me. We are not as close as we were before but now we are normalish friends I lost my place as her private friend. She started dating this guy and well he is pretty shallow but he is good looking. I am fine with it since I just want her to be happy. I should like a cuck right now but what can I do I can suppress my feelings or I can become an real asshole nice guy and I know which I prefer to be. So yeah that is where I am right now going on a similar journey as you guys mostly. \n\nTLDR: I could have fixed my personality and been chad but became a trashy weeb. I pushed away the one person I connected to for academic success and now I am getting destroyed academically. I also don\u2019t have anyone that cares about me. Yeah idk how to explain it faster.

In this post: [https://www.reddit.com/r/ForeverAlone/comments/ab5n1z/welp\\_im\\_gonna\\_do\\_it/](https://www.reddit.com/r/ForeverAlone/comments/ab5n1z/welp_im_gonna_do_it/), I committed to said exercise, in addition to outlining some parameters. Because few bars are open, and few people attend bars, on weekdays, however, I have since amended the exercise; now aiming to speak to three women on Fridays, three on Saturdays and three on Sundays, for the four weekends of January, for a total of 35. The following post comprises my second such account, my account of the night of 04/01/2019.\n\nWell, if my previous night \u2013 my first night \u2013 was an underwhelming failure, then tonight was one hell of a success. I had been reluctant to commit to approaching three women on a given night, assuming that I wouldn\u2019t be able to muster the energy to do so. But how many women did I speak to tonight, my first night after committing to doing so? Six! And it was astonishingly easy.\n\nSo I\u2019m a member of a Meetup which goes bar crawling on Friday nights. I ventured to the bar which it had picked for the night, bought a drink, and proceeded to talk to a sequence of women. Here\u2019s how each conversation went:\n\n1. The conversation with the first woman was amiable, but she was there with a (platonic male) friend whom was leaving the country within a few days, and was clearly more interested in talking to him, so I left them to it fairly quickly.\n2. 2. The conversation with the second and third woman (they were a pair of friends) was highly amiable (lots of laughter), and I contemplated asking both of them for their numbers\u2026 but then both of them mentioned that they were smokers, and I immediately discarded the notion (smoking is a major turn-off for me).\n3. 3. The conversation with the fourth woman was lukewarm, but she was only in the country for a short while, and described having an extremely hectic work schedule whilst she was here (she was on her phone to workmates most of the time), so I deduced she wouldn\u2019t have any time for dating.\n4. 4. The conversation with the fifth woman was amiable, and we actually flirted a bit (she asked if I had a girlfriend, I asked if she was volunteering, she laughed and touched my leg), but she was too old for me.\n5. 5. The conversation with the sixth woman was amiable. By this time, it was getting late, and, having talked to more women than I\u2019d aimed to, I decided to go home, but on a whim, I asked her for her number before I did. And she gave it to me! I\u2019m gonna try texting her tomorrow.\n\n\u2026and, well, there you have it. Needless to say, I went home that night feeling pretty good about myself.\n\nWhat did I take away from this night? For one thing, I\u2019m starting to think that this might be easier than I assumed it would be. In each case, I initiated the conversation by sitting down next to them, saying: \u201cHi, I\u2019m \\[my name\\],\u201d shaking hands with them, and proceeding to talk about banal shit (i.e\u2026 how hot it was, where they were from, our jobs, etc.). There was nothing else to it; no magic formula. For another thing, I\u2019m starting to think that this might be easier than many men on this sub assume approaching women is. Like I said, I am average looking and possess average social skills, yet none of the women balked at the fact that some lowly schlub like me had dared address them. If you refrain from talking to women because you\u2019re afraid they\u2019re going to angrily snap at you, I think your fears might be a teensy bit irrational. Women are not out to get you, dudes.\n\nAnyway\u2026\n\n**Tally:**\n\nGoal: 35.\n\nPoints: 3.\n\nBrownie points: 3.\n\nRejections: 0.\n\nPhone numbers: 1.\n\nAgain; ***polite***, ***constructive***, ***good faith*** suggestions are appreciated.", "subreddit": "ForeverAlone"}

It was actually really satisfying. It was like we had our own little world together that we could just kind of be there and feel comfortable and happy.\n\nThat is the sort of thing I crave now. I wish I could just cuddle with someone who genuinely cares. I wish I could experience affection, maybe this time in person. I don't even know what it's REALLY like, all I have is that highschool experience that kind of simulated it.\n\nI don't know. It's too bad I'm an adult 24 y/o man, as I'm sure this is considered immasculine or childish or something. Normally I'm fine, but sometimes something will trigger this feeling in the back of my mind where I really want this and just feel really lonely and uncared for otherwise.", "subreddit": "lonely"}

Not like Ronaldo or some model, but I look fairly good. I would rate myself 7/10, on my best days 8/10. Do you know how much success I've had with women? Yes, you guessed it- 0.\n\nAnd guess what? I have seen in my life countless amount of guys who look *way* worse than I do and who are in relationships with women I can only dream of. I am not joking when I say countless amount. Just this past month I've seen about 10 guys who are like 3-4-5/10 with beautiful women. It's killing me. \n\nDo you know why? Do you know why I, who is physically attractive (have been told so numerous times) have 0 success with women, and those guys, who are not physically attractive, have a lot of success? \n\nIt's simple.\n\nA) They have confidence\n\nNumber 1 thing *every* woman is attracted to. Why? Because of biology. It is known that confidence is now #1 trait every woman wants in a man and is looking for. Just as we are attracted to beautiful women, women are attracted to confident men. I am shy. That alone kills 90% of chances I ever might have had.\n\nB) They are more interesting than I am\n\nThey know what to talk about with women and how to talk to them. They have some interesting stuff in their lives. On the other hand, I am nerdy. I still haven't met a women who likes Star Wars, Star Trek, Lord of the Rings etc. And before you tell me: \" Women like that exist, I'm sure they would love to talk to you, you just have to find them\"- no. There might be women like me, but they are a minority, hard to find, and even they like confident guys (98,7% of them). I've met a few girls who aren't really nerdy but are introverted and played some games from time to time-they all ended up in relationships with guys with a lot of confidence. And those guys weren't introverted, or nerdy. Just because a women is introverted or shy, or nerdy, that doesn't mean that she is not attracted to confident men. Best I can do with those women is to be their friend.\n\nConclusion: While I do agree that you are in a disadvantage if you are ugly (0-3/10), you aren't doomed. I would go as far as to say that it's better to be 3-5/10 and confident extrovert, than 8/10 but shy and introverted. \n", "subreddit": "ForeverAlone"}

In this post: [https://www.reddit.com/r/ForeverAlone/comments/ab5n1z/welp\\_im\\_gonna\\_do\\_it/](https://www.reddit.com/r/ForeverAlone/comments/ab5n1z/welp_im_gonna_do_it/), I committed to said exercise, in addition to outlining some parameters. Because few bars are open, and few people attend bars, on weekdays, however, I have since amended the exercise; now aiming to speak to three women on Fridays, three on Saturdays and three on Sundays, for the four weekends of January, for a total of 35. The following post comprises my third such account, my account of the night of 05/01/2019.\n\nLess to report this night than last night, I\u2019m afraid\u2026 although it did yield two mildly amusing anecdotes. I find it much easier to approach women at bars when I\u2019m there as part of a Meetup, so that I have other people to talk to in the interim and a pretext for being there in the first place. So I joined another Meetup, one similar to the one I attend on Fridays albeit smaller and which goes out on Saturdays, and ventured to a bar on a waterfront. Tonight, I spoke to four women.\n\nI arrived there a few minutes before anyone else in the Meetup, but wouldn\u2019t you know it, this drunk guy was having a birthday party, saw me standing around by myself, and, on a whim, invited me over to join his group. (Amusing anecdote #1: he was bisexual, and he hit on me \u2013 I, however, am neither gay no bi, and so politely declined). At his table, I spoke to the first two women, although in both cases, only very briefly, since the other people in my Meetup arrived. Nevertheless, all I am obliged to do is initiate conversations, so I\u2019m counting them.\n\nInitially, my Meetup was exclusively comprised of men. A few minutes into it, I asked if any of them would buy me a shot if I approached a woman. One accepted, and so I approached a woman sitting by herself behind me. Alas \u2013 amusing anecdote #2 \u2013 it turned out she was there with her fianc\u00e9. ROFL. But don\u2019t worry, don\u2019t worry; the guy didn\u2019t punch me, or anything. After I explained the situation to them, the three of us had a good laugh, after which I politely excused myself. And thus did I score a free shot.\n\nThen a woman joined the Meetup, and I engaged in a lengthy, amiable conversation with her. However, I didn\u2019t think she was attractive, so right from the start, I never intended to ask her for her number. By this point, it was pretty late, and I was pretty bored, so I went home. No phone numbers tonight, I\u2019m afraid.\n\nWhat did I take away from this night? For one thing, either \\[A\\]; I\u2019m experiencing beginner\u2019s luck, \\[B\\]; I just happen to be naturally good at this, or \\[C\\]; approaching women is much easier than so many (too many) men assume it is. Personally, I believe it\u2019s C. For another thing, Meetups are your friend. In addition to the benefits outlined earlier, they\u2019re also an easy way to obtain casual conversation and acquaintanceships (if not necessarily close friendships), if that\u2019s as much as you want. If you live in a major city, you should be able to find plenty of them doing stuff like going to bars, going to the movies, going to sporting events, etc. on any given Friday, Saturday or Sunday, and I\u2019d recommend you do so.\n\nAnyway\u2026\n\n**Tally:**\n\nGoal: 35.\n\nPoints: 6.\n\nBrownie points: 4.\n\nRejections: 0.\n\nPhone numbers: 1.\n\nAgain; ***polite***, ***constructive***, ***good faith*** suggestions are appreciated.\n\nP.S.: I tried both messaging and ringing the woman whose number I got yesterday, but she didn't respond to either. Such, alas, has been the case with every number I've ever got. I don't want to message or ring them a second time if they don't respond the first time, lest I come off as stalkerish. All I can do on this front, I'm afraid, is keep getting them, ringing them, and hoping that, eventually, one of them will respond.", "subreddit": "ForeverAlone"}

My bed is of decent size, so I often feel around the empty space and become depressed, wishing that a girl that loved me was there sleeping. I'll just lay there in bed, usually late in the night, thinking. Because that's all I can do. I can't sleep, usually. So, I just think. Which is dangerous for me. All of my thoughts are about how I hate myself, how ugly I am, how worthless I feel, how I'll only end up a failure in my adulthood, how I'll die alone, etc. And, you know, with that mentality, you sort of start to believe that you deserve it. That you aren't worthy of anything other than absolute depression and loneliness and failure. Some people I've talked to online will say that I'm a good person, that I'm unique, maybe that I'm talented, or perhaps that there's something special about me. And, as hard as I try to accept their compliments, I can't help but think in my head \"These are all lies. They're either overestimating me, or they're spoon-feeding me white lies to cheer me up. If that's true, why doesn't anybody else say the same? Why am I so alone?\". I don't get it. I don't mean to seem rude or untrusting, but it's so hard. I wish I could accept a compliment and feel proud that I've gotten one, rather that repel it like it's a sickness of some sort. \n\nI feel like I don't belong anywhere. Like no matter where I live, I'd never be popular (not that it matters that much, but it'd be nice), I'd never have a nicely sized click of friends, I'd never have a significant other, and I'd still be the weird, overly sensitive outcast. I wish I could prove myself wrong, but I can't. I don't come from a well-off family, so we barely get by. So, there's no hope of me moving somewhere in the future. Not even when I'm an adult. I feel so hopeless. Like I'll never outlive this. Some people don't. Why should I think that I will? I don't know. I'm sorry for this post being all over the place, I just really wanted to vent.

Why wish for things that will never come true? However, I can't help it. There is nothing more hateful to a lonely person than happy people.\n\nThat being said, I really don't hate people in general. I just hate that we live in a world that is so clearly unfair. I hate that some people have to suffer in solitude and others don't. I hate that my suffering is not even the worst among men and I hate myself for finding some small comfort in that thought.\n\nI feel like a child avoiding responsibility when I blame the world for my problems, but I probably blame myself more than the world anyway.

At the end of the meal I asked her for her number, and as if she was waiting for me to ask, she pulled out a strip of paper and a pen and gave it to me! I said goodnight &amp; went home. I felt like I won the lottery! I was so excited. I haven't dated in YEARS &amp; I've been working on my self esteem.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy phone broke, that next day. And for 2 weeks I kept regretting not calling her from the home phone, but I'm a shy guy! I kept saying I'd buy a new phone, but I never did. I thought about her a ton though... even thought about what it'd be like finally bringing someone to Christmas dinner, or newyears dinner with my family. (I know- we hadn't even gotten to know each other- I was just fantasizing... finally having someone that cared about me)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo finally, tonight, I made up my mind that I was going to surprise her and pop in and ask her to hangout with me next weekend. I even thought about buying her something like a bright orchid or a neon bright tropical flower, but I decided to just head there.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe greeted me with a big smile! She started apologizing, saying that she was on her uncle's cellphone plan &amp; that he turned her service off shortly after we had met. I stopped her and told her it was totally ok, &amp; that I hadn't had a phone to message her. We laughed and joked about how the birthday party in the next room sounded like native americans!!! she recommended a sushi roll for me to try. I ate it quickly. I couldn't wait to ask her out!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nanyway, after heading to the bathroom my check was on the table. I figured i'd better go talk to her. So I walked up to her and told her the roll she recommended was great.

In this post: [https://www.reddit.com/r/ForeverAlone/comments/ab5n1z/welp\\_im\\_gonna\\_do\\_it/](https://www.reddit.com/r/ForeverAlone/comments/ab5n1z/welp_im_gonna_do_it/), I committed to said exercise, in addition to outlining some parameters. Because few bars are open, and few people attend bars, on weekdays, however, I have since amended the exercise; now aiming to speak to three women on Fridays, three on Saturdays and three on Sundays, for the four weekends of January, for a total of 36. The following post comprises my fourth such account, my account of the night of 06/01/2019.\n\nVery little to report tonight. Today I attended a Meetup which was held in the afternoon rather than the evening \u2013 albeit still at a bar. Now, although over 40 people declared that they would attend, only six actually did, including only one woman. I did speak to her briefly, but it\u2019s kind of hard to have a one-on-one conversation with someone when you\u2019re at a table with only six people \u2013 inevitably, we all ended up talking to each other as a whole. Eventually, when it became obvious that nobody else was going to turn up, I excused myself and went home.\n\nBut look, nevermind. Since I don\u2019t seem to actually have any trouble talking to women when they are, in fact, present, and have thus far scored brownie points when they are, I\u2019m not too hung up about talking to an exact quota of 36 women within the month. There are plenty of women present during the Friday Meetups, so meeting this number should mostly come down to repeatedly attending those. If I don\u2019t talk to this many within the month, I\u2019ll just keep doing this into February \u2013 it won\u2019t make any difference. Furthermore, I don\u2019t think that I\u2019ll attempt this at daytime Meetups anymore.\n\n**Tally:**\n\nGoal: 36.\n\nPoints: 7.\n\nBrownie points: 4.\n\nRejections: 0.\n\nPhone numbers: 1.\n\nAgain; ***polite***, ***constructive***, ***good faith*** suggestions are appreciated.", "subreddit": "ForeverAlone"}

That ends up being one of the reasons why I've never had high confidence or self-esteem. However, last year in November this one girl from english institute started talking with me via instagram, and as a result we spent the next weeks addicted to eachother in a way and we used to joke a lot about starting a relationship and stuff like that. She wanted it, I wanted it, so in the 25th of that month I asked her, even though I thought it was a bit rushed, but she accepted it. 2 days later she said things were happening to fast and she just wanted a friendship. I wasn't really able to be just a friend, as things were just awkward between us, and I told her that, which basically ended whatever kind of relationship we had by then. \nI tried to move on but then something happened. Apparently this girl had been talking with one of my best-friend's in instagram as well (he knew everything that happened between us), and they started dating on the same day I ended any type of relations with the girl. That shit fucked me up a lot, and as a result I now feel nothing but hate towards her and my self-esteem and self-confidence are at an all-time low. \n\nNow I don't want my relation with my friend to be affectes but I believe things between us will only be normal again when I stop thinking aout this girl.

I want to be a good person and help people, especially people dealing with this shit. But I need money and power to do so. And in order to obtain that in the way I want it, I need to be in a successful band. And, well, that'll never happen. Nothing else makes me happy, either. So, it's a choice of what I want vs what I need. I want my purpose in life to be making music for people, as well as giving to charity and giving back to the people who bring me up to be who I always wanted to be, as well as to be somebody's lover and to be a father one day and all that dumb shit. But, I feel like the odds are stacked against me, and that my dreams won't ever come to fruition. It terrifies me. It makes me miserable, aside from the loneliness and the fact that my life is shit. That's the main reason why I'm hurting so much. Call me selfish all you want, but that's what I want more than anything. I don't know that I'll ever obtain it. I doubt I will. Most people doubt that I will too. I'm not special. There are better musicians out there. I'm not worthy of anything. I hate myself.", "subreddit": "ForeverAlone"}

Sometimes I feel so shitty because I wonder if I had been chiller my boyfriend wouldn't have left me.

I don't get what my other friends have that I don't but people always chose them over me. They always want to hang out with them, and not me.

I get that there *are* songs about other topics, but they're the exception and not the norm.\n\n**Movies:** Not as blatant as music, but relationships still factor enormously into movies. There's literally an entire genre: \"Romantic comedy.\" Even films that fall outside of this genre \u2013 sometimes, even films that seem to fall *way* outside of it \u2013 will have romantic subplots. And if proper movies don't convince you of the value of sexual/romantic connection, take a look at...\n\n**Pornography:** I won't go into too much detail here, because I know some of you are reading this at work, but according to [a report from Medium,](https://medium.com/@Strange_bt_True/how-big-is-the-porn-industry-fbc1ac78091b), US$3,000 is spent on porn every second.\n\n**Weddings:** How many people do you know who get emotional over weddings? Think about the elaborate pageantry and high emotions associated with weddings. None of that would be possible if it weren't for the groom and bride who made a relationship work. And if non-economic arguments won't convince you, consider this: According to [one report,](https://blog.marketresearch.com/the-wedding-industry-in-2017-and-beyond) the American wedding industry earned $72 billion in 2016, and the average American wedding for that year cost more than $32,000. Would this kind of money be spent on something that \"wasn't important\"?\n\n**Dating:** I have completely lost count of how many websites, books, magazine/newspaper articles, and DVDs are devoted to helping people improve their dating lives. This isn't counting all of the \"coaching services,\" seminars, and courses that exist to assist people. [Some people even make damn good money doing this.](https://www.businessinsider.com/sarah-jones-introverted-alpha-2015-4) If dating wasn't important, then these items wouldn't have a market.\n\n**Lastly, consider the source...** I have never been told \"relationships aren't that important\" or \"sex isn't that important\" or \"having a boyfriend/girlfriend isn't the end-all-be-all\" from *anyone* who was single, or at least anyone who has (like me) reached age 28 without knowing what being desired feels like. While I can't speak for anyone else on this front, most of the time, I hear these words from someone who is married, and often someone who is married with children. I'm at the point where the next time a married person tells me this, I'm going to ask them how likely they are to leave their spouse, since they're admitting that \"relationships aren't that important.\"", "subreddit": "ForeverAlone"}

A year earlier my grandmother died and the school had me go to the counselor's office to make sure I was emotionally ok.  To me this was a waste of time.\n\n(end of spoilers)\n\nMaybe this is why I am alone?  I thought it's really no big deal.  Sure I'm not as emotional as some, but it can't be that much of a turnoff, but seeing it from a spectator's POV, I realize that maybe a lot of the things I say in idle conversation have a greater impact than I thought.  Do people look at me and think I'm some kind heartless asshole?\n\nHell... Am I a heartless asshole?  I can see the offensive end in, say, trashing a dead animal after it's passed.  But, it's not like it's alive to be offended.  Only those around me.  The real issue with such an act is the sanitation end, in my eyes.", "subreddit": "ForeverAlone"}

I had a very tight group of friends there who I loved and felt very close to. We worked at a local pub together, went out every weekend, spent lots of time hanging out and I thought we were inseparable. However due to job situations I moved to another town (not too far away, I can get there in about half an hour by train) I've tried to stay in touch as much as possible, but felt as though it was always me making the effort and when I stopped we began to lose touch.\n\nHowever, out of the blue one of my old friends called me a few weeks ago to tell us another friend had passed away. He was a little older than us but he was a wonderful person who we were very close with and used to hang out with regularly. We had a pub quiz team together, he came to all out birthday celebrations, he helped me to move house when I couldn't hire a van in time, he was possibly the nicest person I ever knew and his death really really upset me. They told me there would be a funeral this month and I asked them to let me know as soon as they knew when it was, and two of them said they would. After not hearing for a week I asked them again, and still they said they would let me know. I told work I would need a day off for it and had to fill out forms to arrange for cover, but due to not knowing the date it's still in a pending process.\n\nThen today I went onto facebook and saw posts about how they had lay him to rest. No one had mentioned it to me at all. I feel really hurt and disgusted. I was already feeling super lonely as I live by myself and don't get to talk to anybody, I'm also alone all day at work. Now knowing my old friends didn't even let me know about a funeral for another old friend has really made me feel horrible. I want to ask where he's buried so I can visit the grave but at the same time I don't want to message them.

But she's adamant.\n\n\"You're planning to eat fast food again, aren't you?\"\n\nI assure her, that's not the case. In fact the food she cooks, is worthy of delivering to any high class restaurant. But it's just that there's no need to wake up so early to make breakfast for me and again to deliver it in my place.\n\n\"Fine, if you don't like my food, I won't come.\" She drops the carefully wrapped 'love' shaped box on the table and storms away through the door.\nThe next day, she's at my room again.\n\nShe texts me various times from her work. \"Did you have lunch?\" \"Are you focusing on your studies?\" \"Did you take shower?

She sits on the sofa with popcorn, while I lay my head on her lap. She takes a few popcorn and puts in my mouth, the rest, she eats herself. You don't know how magical that is until you do it. There is a sense of being cared for.\n\nShe's the only one I can think of as my social circle, and she knows it very well. On weekends, she stays with me on my apartment. She tells me everything. How she got those new shoes at a discounted price. How her friend had a huge fight with her spouse, how she would like to visit this new restaurant that opened up with me. I listen to her with equal fondness and amazement. Her voice is so calming and soothing. I feel like I can almost sleep with that tone in the background. And she realises this. She comes over on me and kisses my forehead. I hold her. Then we cuddle. Time passes and we both go to sleep.\n\nSometimes I wonder- why is she doing this? What have I done to deserve this woman's love? I am a forgettable face among the millions of people out there. Why is she spending her time with me, when she could have fun with her friends somewhere else. But she's with me, every weekend, every month. Whatever the reason, I am very thankful to her. I can only think of how lonely I would be without her. Thanks to her, my inbox is not only filled by messages from the bank and phone company. Thanks to her, I have someone to wander the streets with on Christmas and New Year's eve.

I used to have two really good friends in high school, and at the same time I was basically the guy from me, earl, and the dying girl in the sense that I infiltrated and was accepted in every clique and no one would question my choosing to sit a certain lunch table. But my two good friends no longer talk to me(one quickly got a boyfriend, went to college and now she\u2019s just another annoying college girl who thinks life is just perfect). The other works a lot and doesn\u2019t have time for anyone expect her boyfriend. And here I am, alone. I got to community college, which is basically a two year prison sentence(maybe worse). And it\u2019s impossible to make friends, let alone talk to girls. The main reason I went to community college because my parents(more so my mom) pressured me into going and told me how much money I was gonna save, which is true but I\u2019m the youngest of four children and they spent a shit ton of money for my brothers to go to a really nice college(a private one) and my sister also went to a fairly expensive four year university. And that left me. \n\nI think parents(especially my mom) wanted to keep me around because my parents hate each other so they don\u2019t really talk to each much, and they just use me as a way to vent their problems. Because they don\u2019t really have friends either, but their old and have had their chance at life, and they at least have each but they neglect their marriage and seeing this makes me depressed. \n\nI have one reason to get out of bed in the morning. And that\u2019s movies. I wanna become a filmmaker one day and try to fix the horribly state that the film industry is in(just my opinion). I know this is a big dream and I\u2019m prepared for it not to happen, but right now movies are the thing keeping me going. I have to give myself a movie(or movies) to watch just about everyday so I don\u2019t go insane. This all started about four years ago and I\u2019m very proud to say that I\u2019ve managed to write 6 screenplays in that time. Before I got into movies(an other art) I was severely depressed and then one night in high school I stayed home from the Friday night football game and decided to watch a movie I had heard of but never seen called \u201cPulp Fiction\u201d and I credit that movie(and Tarantino) with saving my life. This may seem silly, but it\u2019s true. That movie lit a fire under my ass. But that doesn\u2019t meant that since then I\u2019ve been happy. For my depression comes in waves and it\u2019s not fun to feel happy one day and miserable the next. \n\nMy point is, every should find that one thing, no matter how small or insignificant, one thing that they can hold onto. But I think that this is where it starts. Some may call it an escape from reality but I think through this thing you can find out who you are and what you want. \n\nThere\u2019s many people out there who have tons of friends and a girlfriend, but they might not have that one thing that sets them apart from the rest. It doesn\u2019t matter if it\u2019s building stuff, or doing magic tricks. As long you find that thing that makes you an individual.

Here is some background. \n\nI'm pretty hardcore weeb and frankly have relatively misogynistic views, such as prioritising fidelity and being against liberalisation of female sexuality. While I can imagine myself compromising on these values in a real relationship, I find it harder to imagine myself being in a real relationship in the first place. \n\nI've been working on myself a lot lately and trying to find solace or happiness in being single, and by myself. To this end, I've embraced once again the hobbies that I've neglected before I went to a phase of really trying to find a relationship. I've recently started watching anime again, reading novels and playing games. I've overall become a happier person. I feel this is indicative that some forms of happiness can be extracted from ones self, while we can grow more and more independent from other forms of happiness extracted from the company of a loved one. The question would then be: to what extent?\n\nWhat kind of happiness can I not get while remaining single? Here are some propositions. \n\nEmotional affection. What is emotional affection in the first place? It is perhaps a longing to be number one in another persons heart. I don't fully understand it myself and I struggle with the lack of emotional affection towards me in my life. \n\nPhysical affection. I feel that this is carnal. There is some overlap with emotional affection that I cannot deny, but I feel this is mostly carnal. These include how I like thighs of anime girls and have a fetish towards East Asian women.\n\nWith that in mind, to extract certain sources of happiness that cannot be attained while single, the idea of a love doll, or a sex doll, or an inanimate object in the shape of a beautiful ideal women that you can make love to seem to be a good source of physical affection. \n\nLove dolls are a relatively pricy investment. High quality ones are above USD1000. Therefore I'd like to have some discussion with other with similar or opposing thoughts before re evaluating my understanding. \n\nHere is what I think love dolls will provide. \n1. Physical affection from your ideal woman. This will fulfil your sexual desires that often distracts you from productive work. \n2. An outlet for all sorts of fantasies. For example, coming home to someone who is waiting for you st home, inanimate as she may be. However, I imagine it is not difficult to impart some imaginary personality on a visage that is so similar to a human woman\n3. Company. I talk to myself a lot. So I don't think it will be difficult to imagine myself speaking to a love doll\n4. Cuddles and hugs. But it's cold because they're made of TPE but I want to work with what I can get. \n5. A love doll will not grow old with you and will stay beautiful \n6. A love doll is loyal to you by design, because her personality is what you impart to her in your fantasies. \n\nWhat do you think about love dolls? Have you considered procuring one? Have you procured one? Have they helped you with loneliness? I'd love to know. \n\nThanks\n", "subreddit": "lonely"}

When I say I have nothing to offer, I mean I have nothing to offer of any value. Certain therapists have told me I have a lot to offer like my sense of humor, and....uh....not much else. Anything like being nice is now considered a negative. I tell them, you need to have something to offer with dating. If you don't have the looks, you need to make up for it in another area and it's not shallow for women to want a guy who they are physically attracted, or want a guy that is financially secure. I can't offer anything that counts. A sense of humor is a nice bonus but I unless the guy is a professional comedian, I don't think a woman would get with a guy just for his sense of humor.

Women prefer a guy who has friends because it's a red flag if he has no friends. In every category that counts, I have nothing to offer. I don't see how my statement about me having nothing to offer isn't true. \n\nI'm sure I will get the usual if you don't love yourself, don't expect anyone else to love you even though that has been proven to be bullcrap. I will also probably get the if you don't think you have anything to offer, women won't want to get with a guy with low self-esteem. I'm far too old to care about cliche lines coming from non-FA'ers. They will have a story about a guy who of course had nothing to offer but is either in a long term relationship or married. They always have those antidotes ready for FA'ers.

And I don't blame anyone for that!  \nI'm a nearly 30 years old gay man, and I feel ridiculously lonely. It's true that I have my brother and my mum, but it feels like they have this thing of theirs now, and I'm just an occasional visitor in this niche.   \nI have very few friends too, but I don't feel like I belong in their world. All of them except for one is straight, and my only gay friend, well, we just are different, and being with him makes me feel like I might have missed so much of life, and this makes me feel like crap. Perhaps I'm a bad person who's jealous, I don't know. But I like it that he's able to live his gay life fully, it's just that it saddens me that I've had virtually no experience with men. I even wonder if I do have any friends at all.  \nNow, this will sound like a sob story, but I have never had any real friend my entire life. I mean, not even in Kindergarten. I used to talk to some kids, but I don't remember playing with them or being in their groups. I just remember daydreaming a lot. That would be a world with lots of magic and stuff.  \nThings did not really change when I joined elementary school. I was gay, and it was in the mid 90s, and there wasn't this 'gay' thing yet. Hell, I did not even know why I preferred playing with the girls, or why I wanted to sit next to the prettiest boys, or why I liked it when the guys treated me as a sissy back then. So I wasn't really with the guys, and not really with the girls, so kinda on my own.  \nThings were worse at home. I did not go outside to play because I was not allowed to. And if I ever played that would be with the cousins who always beat the shit out of me, but I still liked playing with them, but it wasn't until I was 10 or 11, that I felt like, 'Damn, I'm not even their friend'.  \nIronically my father had me admitted to an all boys High School. While I somewhat did 'man up' not to be the victim, I never fitted with any group. I was not with the nerds, because they had all sort of games and stuff, and I had none. Not with the athletes because I was overweight. Not with the 'normal' because I was weird. Just alone. I desperately tried to get into groups. I even tried to join the bullies, and I am extremely ashamed that I even bullied some of the guys, despite getting bullied myself. Years later, I would try to find some of them and apologise. But it wasn't anything harsh, like getting physical or severe psychological abuse, but it was still bad of me to do so. Anyway, I have yet to apologise to 2-3 of them. I have even crossed path with them, but never gathered up the courage to apologise.  \nNow this is going to sound like some serial-killer-in-the-happening story.  But it was around my time in High School that I started realising that I might have OCD, and I used to have these really foul thoughts ([intrusive thoughts](https://adaa.org/learn-from-us/from-the-experts/blog-posts/consumer/unwanted-intrusive-thoughts)), and for years I have struggled whether I deserved to be alone because of the nature of these thoughts, which I felt like were really my 'inner desire' or something. I couldn't talk about it with my mother because she was herself kinda damaged (because of my father - abusive, psychotic and violent), and I did not have friends, so I just lived with it, and this kinda impeded my attempts into being social.\n\nHowever, it was also around that time that I met someone ONLINE. I kinda really liked him, and he was my only friend for a while. It might sound pathetic, but I also feel like I kinda fell in love with him. I did not meet him, because he was still in love with someone, but that someone had left the country for his studies, and also because I was overweight. So I tried losing weight, trying to look pretty for him, and which I did, but I got lots of stretch marks, and which just destroyed my already miniscule self-esteem, so I was terrified that he wouldn't like me because of how my body looked like now.  \nEarlier on, I joined one of those chatroom, this was a time when we did not even have mobile phones with colour screen (early 2000s), and I met this guy for something 'casual', but when he saw me naked, he just said that he had to go, and this kinda remained with me.  \nAnyway, I did not feel like I needed anybody because I had this guy, even if it was all online, but it just wasn't real, so it just faded away, and it's been probably around 6 years or so that I have not heard of him. What is even more pathetic in all this, is that I never met him; there are days when I feel like what if he was just imaginary, and that I'm mad. It sortof hurts to think of him, 'cause I had allowed myself to think that he was THE ONE.  \nAnyway, so I did not meet anyone else; I was always sickly (actual sickness which required surgery in 2016 - but I'm hopefully cured now), depressed, moody, and I felt ugly as fuck.   \nRegardless of all this, I actually tried meeting with guys. I was now a 6'2, mixed brown guy, who was lean, and who got lots of attention from girls. I mean a hell of a lot of it.  \nSo much that I felt like as I wasn't getting any guys, I should really try with girls, but it was hard. I tried it once, twice, and thrice. But I felt so bad about not ever being able to return the feeling, that it was all finished in a one-date thing.  \nYes, I did try to meet guys. Lots of them. We now had Facebook, and there was Skype, technology just opened millions of doors. But it just did not work.  \nAt one point, I remembered that I was so bitter after he was gone that I shut myself down for a a year or two. Then, when I started looking for guys, nobody seemed to like me. I must have chatted with a thousand man, but nothing came up from it.  \nI felt like perhaps there was something wrong with me, because I was already so fucked up you know, not as fucked up as an ISIS victim forced into sexual slavery, but just fucked up.  \nI met guys; I tried to be nice, but nothing. I once went to meet this guy, and after a movie, he told me that he got a call from his mother. Then another, who told me that I had dead eyes. Then another, then another, then another.  \nI even started meeting with creeps, people who said they were 20, but were really in their 40s, just because I felt like probably life was unjust with them too, and that these people were really me after 20 years or so.  \nAnyway, after my surgery, I gained tremendous amount of weight. But it was also a time when my father wreaked havoc at home (told everyone he was going to kill himself because of me and my mum: LOL), and I felt like perhaps this is how I was meant to live. Perhaps there was no ending to all of this, so I did not even try to lose weight. I, of course, did not get any attention at all from guys anymore.  \nBack in the present, I have by now lost around 30 pounds or so, and I'm kinda looking better. I'm trying to work on my appearance, and even got myself a half sleeve done, which masquerades the very old and thin stretch marks magnificently. I feel like I have to give myself a chance again, because if I don't, who will.  \nBut now, it's been quite a while, since I have been feeling different. I feel like I'm too old now. I feel like that who's going to want a guy, so physically and mentally damaged like me. I feel like a freak, a freak who's still a virgin at 29.  \nSo this is why I feel ridiculously alone. I'm the kind of guy who sometimes hugs a pillow, and cries himself to sleep. But there are times like when I like to imagine I'm hugging someone who loves me, and I could hear his heartbeats and his warmth, and stuff.  \n\n\nI just feel like that. And I feel like that I must be cursed in some way to be this way, because I just can't identify with other people...", "subreddit": "lonely"}

Sure we can become a an enlightened Buddha of an individual and detach ourselves from each and everything there even is in life but most of us don't want to do that. We just want to live a good life and part of that being appreciated and loved in return. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo if someone outside of ourselves is in control then we are doomed right? Not exactly. I am not saying you will ever get a girlfriend, nor am I saying you won't get one, the truth is no one knows the future and when people try and predict the future they usually fail pretty hard! \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo in order to experience change you have to do something. Hit the ball into someone else's court. Sure most of the time they will simply ignore it and move on giving you no thought whatsoever. I did this in my work life while searching for another job after I had recently quit a high pay job that was toxic towards my health. I had faith that I was not doomed (despite my co-workers and old boss saying GOOD LUCK finding another job better than this). I sent out probably a hundred applications. Then one day got a call in which was the first interview (which I bombed)... So I thought nothing of it and then they called me back for a second interview which I did much better than the first and they decided to give me a shot. As of now I work 10 times less than my previous job and make more money. Had I not just threw the ball into every single court I possibly could have I wouldn't have found this job. Had I chickened out after the first interview (because I really did do bad) then I would have probably had to settle for a lower level job. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow that is an example from my work life. I know the dating world is similar albeit a little different. I have never even asked out a single girl since middle school. So to say \"I have tried everything\" would not only be bullshit to you guys but to myself as well. I know some of you guys really have done a lot and I am not talking about you, I am speaking of people like myself who bitch and complain but honestly have done NOTHING to improve their life but would make post after post about how no girl would ever like me. And maybe a girl won't ever like me? I don't know. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo the point of the post is that you can only control one thing in life. Hitting the ball into someone else's court. Once there it is that persons choice to do with it as they please. Ignore it (the usual), destroy it in the hopes of breaking your spirit :( , or to return it back to you :) . So there is no point getting upset what people choose to do with it. Just know that you did your part. You put yourself into the world and the only people you would want in your life anyway are those who return that same energy you gave back. \n\n ", "subreddit": "ForeverAlone"}

Having parents addicted to drugs meant I was with strangers or alone while they binged, so I learned to take care of myself.\n\nHaving to parent my parents while growing up and figuring shit out on my own meant I developed a very no-nonsense approach to people, when I decide a person sucks that\u2019s it, I cut them out and write them off. Obviously, this happens a lot because people generally suck...not on purpose, it\u2019s just people fail a lot even when they try. Now I\u2019ve been in a 3 year relationship with someone incredibly stable and healthy (they are basically the opposite of me in every way) and I\u2019m lonelier than ever.

I work, eat, sleep, and take care of responsibilities. \n\nWhenever I try to do things I think I should be doing like exercising, reading, going out with coworkers, journaling, meditating, whatever healthy thing therapists/doctors/Internet/pretty much everyone else says you should do, I hate it. It\u2019s like pulling teeth. I\u2019d much rather lay their and stare into nothing, feeling sorry for myself. \n\nWhy? Idk. Maybe because it\u2019s familiar and easy whereas maintaining relationships and putting effort into enjoying my life is hard. But why should it be hard? It doesn\u2019t seem hard for my boyfriend or other people who are typically healthy, in fact they enjoy it. Get up at 5AM and go to the gym?! Sure! Come home and meditate then journal while listening to nature sounds?! Absolutely! Have some coffee and play fetch with the dog?! Sounds fun! Have a productive day mentoring coworkers and solving problems to then come home and go to yoga with friends?! Awesome! \n\nUgh.

Advice Needed", "author": "TakuHazard", "self_text": "This is a mess and I hope that someone can bare with it and give me some advice. I will try to be as brief as possible.\n\nLast  year I met a girl let's call her Jenny and we really hit it off. She  had a boyfriend then and that was undeniably a downer but yeah we still  could be friends right? At this point I knew things were kind off (for  example I learnt that her boyfriend had engaged in 12 sexual encounters  before and that it was a long distance thing). Well I think she began to  distance herself which was fine as I had moved on somewhat. Well in  early November I saw her around campus and she seemed really off. We  talked for a bit and later that night she called me; she was having  really big problems. That was the last time I saw her. She told me that  she had a pyschotic break down and had to drop off university. At this  point she also apologised for being racist (?) - Jenny is Asian and I am  black.\n\nThat  was that. We stopped talking for so long (tbh at this point I was  really infatuated with someone else), she broke with her old bf and got a  new dude. So last summer, we started talking again. Some old problems  with the new boyfriend. They broke up and she sent what seemed to send  what I interpreted as a suicide message. Did my best and talked her out  of it. Proceeded to unfriend her as I still had reciprocated feelings  for her but wanted to get my life sorted out.\n\nWell  last semester I made a horrible mistake. I readded her and apologised  for cutting her out earlier on. She said she was on meds for her  psychotic conditions. I had largely moved on at this point. I tried to  limit our contacts (would randomly me send me unsavory messages like how  she had urinated herself or how she had diarrhea (wtf?)). Well things  ratched up and she finally video-called me. Told me she had a big crush  on a prof at her new university. We were talking and she changed her  positions and I randomly caught a glimpse of something in her drawer.  Somehow she knew and asked me if I wanted to know. Told me it was her  masturbatory devices. Anyways at this point in time she knew that I had  began having feelings again. This was last month\n\nShe  has organized her birthday party for next Friday. Yesterday we were  talking about generally sad stuff and she sent me a link to the most  bullshit pseudoscience guru thing. Something about visualizing thoughts  before sleeping helps acutalize them. I thought it was one of the  positive change your mindset tell she told me that she was trying it on  her professor. I found this extremely ridiculous (and stupid tbh) and  told her that not only is love/lust a simple reaction to dopamine,  testosterone, estrogen and other chemicals but if we assumed that this  batshit crazy method worked then it's no different from a love portion  and is unethical. She got offended at this point and I naturally backed  out, after sending her an article on the latest scientific research on  love.  That was last night. Today she sent a message that she partially  agreed with me and I didn't respond. Then after 2 hours she sent me a  message about how she was taking a shit (wtf??). I didn't respond. Then  she sent me a link to her youtube channel and it was a rant about her  looks. I briefly browsed through the channel and there was one of those  fake music videos dedicated to her ex where she talks about how she  never loved him. Once again I didn't respond. Then she asked me if I  still liked her romantically. I asked her what she thought to which she  responded in the negative.\n\nI  do not know what to make of all this. Her friends (she once made me  join a skype group chat and noone even acknowledged me) seem to be of  the same disposition. I am beginning to get cold feet about the party  and I know this sounds dumb but I think I still like her.\n\nPlease give me your thoughts.

{"post_id": "aell4g", "created_utc": 1547143354, "title": "[Opinion] Loneliness is not just an individual moral failure, it is a social and public health crisis", "author": "Uptons_BJs", "self_text": "So I\u2019m a shitty sociologist by training at least. I did my time in the social science department and walked out with a release form saying that I am now an eligible bachelor with an education in criminology. I\u2019m also a gregarious guy who went into the social sciences to socialize (assuming incorrectly that sociologists like to socialize).\r\n\r\nWhat has always fascinated me was how modern sociology has for the most part moved away from a pure individual failure perspective towards a macro level analysis of social trends in determining individual outcomes. . For instance, classical criminology claims that a criminal evaluated the risk and reward of committing a crime, and decided that the crime is worth it. Modern criminology would often look at it from a social perspective, that the social environment encourages people to commit crimes. \r\n\r\nBy adopting a more macro level approach to analyzing social behavior, we have made huge strides in developing new crime fighting strategies, education techniques, and economic theories. If you look at cutting edge social sciences, the macro level approach to analyzing social issues is hugely popular, and in my view, almost diminishes the role of personal agency too much sometimes. \r\n\r\nYet if you look at the general discourse about loneliness, the majority of both the academic discourse and popular media paints it as an individual failure. Just compare the difference between the two scenarios: if you tell people you can\u2019t find a job, they sympathize. Politicians have job programs and retraining programs, there\u2019s unemployment insurance and retraining tax credits and numerous pieces of both government and non government programs and policies intended on helping you. This is because society understands that unemployment is not purely an individual failure, there are significant social and economic reasons as to why one might be unemployed.\r\n\r\nYet if you tell people you\u2019re lonely, complain about how you don\u2019t have a girl/boyfriend or even any friends, people assume there\u2019s something wrong with you personally. To a lot of them, loneliness is purely a personal failing, you either don\u2019t shower or you are a creep. There are no government programs to assist you, nor is there much serious academic research on how to help you.\r\n\r\nThe effects of loneliness is crippling. Despite the lack of large scale studies and data collection on the subject, it isn\u2019t hard to figure out that long term loneliness (aka, forever alone) must be horrific for one\u2019s mental health. More research is needed, but it isn\u2019t hard to imagine that this is also a drag on the economy and healthcare system too.\r\n\r\nIn fact, people do recognize the issues that loneliness causes. There exists ample academic research on how loneliness effects the elderly and people who live in remote communities. It is great that we can acknowledge that people whose spouses have died face significant psychological challenges, but unfortunately, the general attitude towards those who couldn\u2019t get a romantic partner in the first place is still \u201ctake a shower\u201d.\r\n\r\nTo look at a slightly different example, hiring managers often complain that young people routinely perform poorly in interviews. To combat this, schools have career centre\u2019s that provide help like mock interviews. If we can acknowledge that inexperienced people perform poorly in social situations like interviews, the same must apply to first dates no? Now to be fair, there does exist a significant imbalance in power and experience with interviews that usually doesn\u2019t exist with dating. Inexperienced 20 year olds mostly date other inexperienced 20 year olds, whereas in interviews, it\u2019s often inexperienced 20 year olds vs hiring managers who have interviewed thousands. But what about the older 30,40 year olds here on r/foreveralone?\r\n\r\nMaking friends and dating is treated as a skill that one picks up through osmosis. At most you pick up a few tips from your parents or older sibling. This works for the majority of society, but obviously there are huge groups of people for whom this doesn\u2019t work for. To those people, our advice is, take a shower.\r\n\r\nI do understand that in a population of billions, there has to be people who are essentially alone due to their own deficiencies. Just like how, there are people who are unemployed because they\u2019re unemployable. But there are also huge numbers of people who aren\u2019t horrible and undateable, yet have no prospects. To me, this is society failing them.\r\n\r\nNow I\u2019m not a radical incel who is here to insist that the government should assign girlfriends and mandate friends. I\u2019m just a former social scientist who believes that there exists a major, unresearched social problem. I have my hypothesis why so many people have social issues. I think it is an issue with how kids are brought up, and how their unstructured time has been replaced with structured time with status imbalances. For example, kids used to play baseball on the street more, where they learn to resolve issues between teammates and make new friends. Replace that with structured league play and coaching sessions, although you learn more baseball, you lose out on picking up many social skills.\r\n\r\nRegardless of the underlying reasons, it is time for us to acknowledge that loneliness isn\u2019t just a failure of personal responsibility, or even just a genetics thing. Society and education have played a role in this public health crisis and its time for us to acknowledge it.\r\n\r\nLet me end with a story. 2 months ago, I was waiting for my new job to start. I decided to post here looking for a new friend in Toronto. Most people thought I was a crazy organ harvester, but I did meet a young man in his early 20s but was a virgin and had no romantic success. He wanted some help, so we worked on his appearance and behavior a little bit. He also needed a friend who was behind him all the way, which I was. I\u2019m not going to take all the credit as he himself worked really hard, but today, he is no longer a virgin or alone. Now I know as a social scientist I should never extrapolate from a sample size of 1, but it is my belief that most forever alone people aren\u2019t too far away from making it. All they need is a little help.\r\n\r\nPs: I swear I\u2019m not crazy. If anyone here is from Toronto and needs a new friend, pm me. \r\n", "subreddit": "ForeverAlone"}

I'm probably too masochistic but I don't know if I should do anything about these feelings, basically:\n\nToo old, too ugly/fat, too tired, and not even sure I can make anyone happy or give them what they want. So basically just eating and waiting to die. There was a thread about losing interest in gaming and I'm kinda getting there but whatever else there is to do. I tried to play a MMO to meet people and just ended up running a guild of all guys and I'm not bi. Then the game is buggy as shit and it kills my motivation.\n\nAlso does anyone basically intentionally just \"friendzone\" themselves now? I'm pretty sure I know that I'm friendzoning myself with what I reply to people if they start being nice to me at all, but since its genuinely how I'm feeling at that time and what I want to say, I just keep repeating it. I will be supportive and show some interest and then I will just vanish for a few weeks and repeat that. That's kind of a habit any way so that I don't overload anyone.\n\nI can't even think about all that I wanted to write about really. When I get lonely or just not playing games for whatever reason I go on facebook and try to write something nice to my friends. Doesn't really help the loneliness but I'm glad for the feedback they give me. I resigned to be single and friend to everyone, but I still, I've got nothing against me dying right now, so I don't think that's really happiness for me I think it's just a resignation.I don't have many guy friends on facebook, it sucks if for example I'm friends with someone who has social anxiety and he's wildly popular with both genders, I just feel jealous I guess because I try my hardest but can't ever see myself in that position normally. I don't make posts on my own facebook page except for private ones with like one person tagged occasionally, probably because I'm just embarrassed or anxious to post anything myself.\n\nAnyone need anything from me? Because I'll probably go take a break from things from a while and then go give the MMO thing another try, just don't have all the energy I used to. I'm still hoping death comes sooner than later but I could also go another 10-20 years without problems really. I'm looking after my mom and if I wasn't doing that then maybe I'd be looking harder too and maybe actually trying dating - or killing myself faster, either way.\n\n&amp;#x200B;", "subreddit": "ForeverAlone"}

Since I don't seem to have any trouble initiating conversations with women despite having no prior experience, I am no longer concerned about my aptitude declining if I don't do it on a consistent basis; am no longer concerned about meeting an exact quota of 36 within the month.

I'm dying on the inside internally bleeding. \n\nThe little solace I had left has been snatched away from me. My hours at work are even being cut. It's just all hitting me at once.\n\nI think I should try to calm down now before I have an anxiety attack. I seriously feel the blood being sucked out of my body. Out of my soul. I just wish it would stop. \n\nI didn't mean for the post to be this lengthy. Thank you for reading.\n\n\n", "subreddit": "lonely"}

I actually felt confident and good about myself. \nShe seemed very excited about the whole thing too, because she apparently had an eye on me for a while and we shared interests so we had tons of stuff to do and talk about. We did have a deal to give each other some space, cause exams are coming and we both really need to get our grades up.\n\nAnd then suddenly... radio silence. No fight, no disagreement, no awkward moments, the time between replies just kept getting longer. As of writing this, I haven't heard a word from her in 2 days.

Its one thing to take your time and study, but I can see she's been active everywhere online, she's just ignoring my messages.

She was a bit drunk, and soon so was I. She was attractive \\*enough\\*, and said she was hoping to get laid at the party. Midnight comes around and she asks me to be her NYE kiss. I say of course. Midnight strikes and we makeout and get handsy quickly. Later she says she wants to take a shower, and I ask if she wants to right now, so we go to the bathroom and undress each other. She pops my dick in her mouth and all I could say is that I was shocked. It was a scene I never thought would ever happen. I tell her I'm a virgin, adding that I've never lost my virginity because I never lose. She finds that really shocking and unbelievable (being a virgin). We step into the shower and I play with her pussy. The whole vulva is like a penis basically, the same textures, but more like meat. She gave me instructions, little higher, little lower, etc. then tells me to go in with my fingers. So I do. The actual vagina feels like a butthole lol, so if you want to know what it's like put your own finger in your ass. We fool around a bit more, I throw on a condom, but I couldn't get hard, a result of anxiety and drinking, I hope, so we decided to not do it and try again another time. Which honestly in retrospect, sober, I'm happy about. I didn't know her at all and casual sex doesn't appeal to me at all.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI had been hanging out with a co-worker lately and she was sending a lot of mixed signals: a lot of touching, smiling, bringing up sex etc. but once I asked her out she got very defensive and said she wasn't interested at all. Later she texted me and said she had been lying, that she was very attracted to me and liked me as a person but that it was hard for her to be vulnerable and she wasn't ready for dating right now. Which I didn't really care about as I was only sort of interested in her.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAt a little bar with my friends about a month ago and as we were leaving to go to a diner, as I was literally saying to my friends that society unfairly puts all the pressure on males to approach women, and how I felt I was undesirable, one of the women from the bar came up and took my arm. At the diner she was all over me, we were making out etc. and she said she wanted to go back to my place. I took her aside and told her that I didn't have any condoms and wouldn't be able to get some for a while (which is another topic) and she said that condoms weren't important. That freaked me out. Don't have sex with random women who don't care about condoms! I instead went home alone, kind of glad.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm not sure what I've been doing differently. I go to the gym sometimes. I'm in therapy and that's going well. I don't think I'm at all good-looking, but thinking about couples I know where the man is pretty ugly and the woman isn't sways me a bit more into thinking personal preference in attraction is a real and present thing. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI \\*think\\* maybe I have been thinking about sex and romance incorrectly. I thought sex and romance were a product of self improvement, that if I were good enough then I would get a girlfriend. Maybe there is a case to be made for trying to make yourself the best you can be, but, to speculate, I think all that stuff really is a result of socializing. Now for me the problem is finding someone who I like, as a person, who likes me back.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nGood luck out there!\n\nEDIT: I definitely didn\u2019t think you guys would be calling me a chad or normie, I thought this would be better received.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;", "subreddit": "ForeverAlone"}

After this day I actually knew what people thought of me. Time went by and I kept becoming introverted, widrawn from friendships, talking much with people.

Some of it even included \"bullying\" ( I just hate this, whener I see bullying I just want to leave so bad). Time goes and goes and alevels.

O relied on games thinking I can make some friends there but I could not find any? All that matters to people are if your a girl or that you are a god at games.

{"post_id": "af16wj", "created_utc": 1547247808, "title": "Think I'm ready to cut off the loose ends", "author": "somewhereinside", "self_text": "Hi. I'm 17, college student, haven't \"made\" a friend once in my life - I had friends but only because they approached me, introduced to friends of friends, playdates and classmates etc. Never have I actively connected with someone and I honestly don't know how to; there's a chance I may be on the autistic spectrum but I'm not that impaired and my parents went against me seeing a specialist when younger, I can function in every way properly except socially.\n\nAt the end of yr6 (age 11) I had lost all my primary school from breaking up and going to different secondary schools, it stung for a little bit but within the first month of secondary school I became the school bookworm: spending break, lunch and spare moments in lesson reading books. I was bullied a little but I don't care anymore. When GCSEs neared I swapped generic books for revision and course-related material, by combining this frequent early revision with my excersise routine by my dedication to wake up at 5:30AM; optimised lesson time due to no school drama and, what I considered mental harmony by never having to deal with other people's problems or lust or romance I thought of myself as a streamlined modern human: The Ubermenschen \n\nI was legitimitely happy with being alone until yr10, had my first and only girlfriend (she asked me out similar to my friends only befriending me) causing me - for the first time - to crave being with anyother human being. So since we broke up after she cheated four months in I've been trying to integrate back into the solo life but it just hasn't fit together right. I started seeing my future, I'd see apparations of what I would look like as I slowly decayed and became forgotten. But after so long I know the reason why I haven't been able to get back to my old self.\n\nA couple of months after my breakup I was still destraught but tried to make \"friends\" for the first time, whereby I was Facebook messaging classmates, these faulty desperate friends fell apart quickly, ending even quicker than my only romantic partnership. But when that managed to stay around was who I will refer to as W.\n\nW approached me to make friends, as they all have, as word got out that I was \"finally opening up\". Secrets my ex released about me had become common knowlegde by this point but I could confide myself into W whenever my inner feelings were hurting me, something what was only a minor issue before my ex despite the contents of my anguish not changing. Besides me talking through my issues with W nothing else really happened, I would send a meme and get a nice thumbs up in return, we'd exchange words sometimes in school two: but as my affections for them grew I wanted to talk more, even to be physical in some way. However I could see the truth, either I'd humiliate myself by trying to asking her out and maintain a embarrasing plutonic stance, or have another relationship that would eventually end - I saw no other way and I hid my feelings.\n\nI've been in college 4 months now. Since the summer holiday 3 months prior (total = 7) me and W had gradually talked less and less, only getting a thumbs up if I sent a meme: humans words getting little response. A week before the start of college I got hospitalised and got brain surgery. In my near death moment all I could think about was W being with them for eternity in eachother's arms, so much that in my first moments of conciousness all I could do was tell my nan that I needed her to tell W what happened. For the rest of my hospital stay all I could think about was talking with W, at one point crying so hard because I loved W, crying myself to sleep imagining I was lying with them. \n\nUpon discharge I got onto social media and found I got message by W, they told me they loved me (interpreted platonically) but just hoping I'd get well soon. I was thrilled to talk with W, we had a bit of a stable conversation, its rare for me to manage that with W therefore anyone. We found out we would share one lesson together. By the time I was deemed fit for college I had already missed the first week, so everyone else was settled into friendship groups, seating plans, the way college and courses work (what I'm still struggling with). But I got there and was anticipating the lesson I shared with W, to have real life interaction after so long and so much. And I was very much dissapointed in that when lining up for the lesson and in the lesson they didn't speak to me at all, W definately saw me but we wouldn't even message on the internet unless I intiated communication like always, with W leaving me on \"seen\" until it suited them or ignoring me indefinately: I remember one time I caught them out on this, we had a test but I got pulled out of lesson to see my neuro-doctor after completing before I knew what I was missing for the rest of the lesson, after asking W they left me on seen for 3 hours; I replied \"oh I'll take that as nothing then\" finally getting back a \"no we just marked the test\".\n\nA couple of days ago I was in a canteen on my normal solo lunch break, collecting my lunch what is the same everyday when I see W  with a group of new friends they made and left me for to excitingly be. I'm gonna be honest and say I was angry, despite trying to be the best friend possible and have so much love for this person they had phased me out of their life to start over. So I have had the resolve to shut off communications forever, before she replies to the meme she's currently ignoring; the thumbs up I will recieve from it will send endorphins to my brain and reinforce my love for W so I need to break the viscious cycle now. I'm just going to type \"no more friends, don't talk to me anymore\" but that in itself is attention-seeking, maybe I should just unfriend them and be done with it.\n\nI'm sorry for writing this, I just felt like I need to and I know I'm about to feel the struggle of getting back into the loniliness again, just this time without the false cover of a fake friendship.

We, as a community, have founded this idea that there is in fact **not** \u201csomeone for everyone\u201d, contrary to one of the infinite aforementioned fallacies spewed by sheltered individuals.  \n\n\n\n\nI wrote this column as a response to what this community has dubbed \u201cmeme advice,\u201d which, simply put, is advice given by certain blinded individuals that cannot comprehend an existence outside of their own world they\u2019ve created for themselves. To simply say \u201cwell, if **x** worked for me, it must work for everyone\u201d is about as far from the truth as saying \u201cTikTok ads are actually funny.\"\n\n\n \nAnother fallacy that is pushed upon this community is that \u201cif everyone at /r/foreveralone just took better care of their hygiene once and a while, they could find someone.\u201d The fact that I actually have to address something so asinine and, quite frankly, rude, is pathetic. Once again another means of generalizing a group of people that simply cannot be labeled. There are **too** many of us to be summed up into an accurate depiction of what \u201cforevever alone\u201d truly is. Even the people that are a part of this community cannot properly define the words. The fact that yet another keyboard warrior has stumbled across this subreddit and decided to break his arm from stroking his ego so hard and stating other cliches he\u2019d sooner call \u201coriginal\u201d than admit he stole it from /r/relationships, is\u2026 Well, **sad**. When the word \u201csad\u201d is indicated in these paragraphs, I hope you, the Reader, can truly appreciate the gravity of this insult, given 99% of the forever alone community suffers from legitimate clinical depression and truly knows what **sad** is. \n\n\n\n \nWhen it comes to the effectiveness of whatever \u201cadvice\u201d you think is so life-changing you\u2019d need to shove it down the collective throats of a community that\u2019s been otherwise shat on by the world entirely, understand: Even if whatever you have to say is legitimately useful (it ~~probably~~ certainly is **not**), there is a guaranteed 80 percent, at least, of this community that will **immediately** downvote you and / or begin a witch hunt, if deemed appropriate at the time of posting. \n\n\n\nSo, before you post here to the /r/ForeverAlone subreddit, I **implore** you: **DON\u2019T**. We don\u2019t need your empathy. You\u2019re not going to ascend us all to \u201cChadhood\u201d just by telling us to shower. Matter of fact, if you\u2019ve read all this and continue to think \u201chmm... Telling them to bathe would be a good idea\u201d : I hope your post gets drowned in a sea of downvotes and our own proverbial feces. \n\n\nSincerely, \n\n\n\nThe /r/ForeverAlone community. \n\n\n\nHave a nice stay. ^/s\n", "subreddit": "ForeverAlone"}

I take pills, so that helps. Anyways, I'd appreciate it if no one bitched to me about how ungrateful I am or how I'm acting special. Any bullshit like that can be left at the door. I don't need it.\n\nMy entire life, I've had no best friends-- no one I can talk to about anything. I feel like all I'm good for is a quick laugh and possibly someone to talk to, but not someone to listen to. \n\nWith the relationship side of things, I'm even more confused. I dress decent and nice, I smell good, I NEVER brag or try hard, and I'm nice if someone is nice to me. Despite me bitching to the internet about this, I've never done it in real life. So, no one in real life has a reason to think I'm a try hard or upset about me being alone.\n\nBefore anyone tells me to put myself out there, I have. I've kissed two guys, and it was a mistake to me. I've asked \"friends\" to hang out, and every time they say they're busy. No, they're not busy, because they're never busy. Maybe I'm just being a stupid bitch, but it's how I feel.\n\nI put up a tough front, and I never take shit from anyone. That's probably why I have no real friends.\n\nAnyways, are people intimidated by me? Many people have told me that no one new talks to me, because I intimidate them.

Literally, a guy in my dreams that I ended up falling for for a few months when I was 15. I still remember what was going on when we met; you could hear the alarm blaring in the distance as people ran to the nearest community shelter, people screaming as children clung to their parents and screamed. The sky was gray, the air chilly and my lungs were burning.\n\nI was running, my parents in front of me as we ran for safety. I thought we weren't going to make it as my foot caught on something and I fell forwards. Before hitting the ground, I felt my body jolt, a sharp pain in my left arm as a hand curled around the elbow. I thanked whoever saved me, looking up from the asphalt into jewel like eyes. Dark, whispy hair framed a rather round face, a dark beanie resting on straight strands that just barely brushed his eyes and cheeks. Broad shoulders, thick arms and a strong grip is what allowed me to fall even deeper into the pools of his eyes and I knew I was hooked. I knew that I wanted him before I even woke up and remembered.\n\nI would see him in my dreams for a few months after, once or twice meeting in what looked like a French movie set before walking towards a hotel room and just talked.\n\nThen it stopped.\n\nA couple of years later, I'm working at a grocery store bakery, a deli worker chilling and talking to a coworker about soulmates. She fully believed that her husband was her soulmate; she saw him in her dreams. She told me that the one I saw was my soulmate.\n\nIt's a year later now.\n\nI'm still not sure if I believe her.\n\nI've never met the guy or any guy that's been like him.

Now I'm not saying you can't be depressed if you're in a relationship. Nor am I saying that being in a relationship while depressed is a healthy thing.\n\nWhat I am saying, is that these people have a potential source of encouragement, support, and validation that people here will never have. Yes, being in a relationship while depressed/with a depressed person may not be healthy. But it may also lead the depressed person to get better and improve themselves due to their partner. As much as people with depression say it's not a good thing to dive into a relationship while in a bad mental state, the fact is that it may still help. However, not ever been in a relationship only brings more negativity into a person's mental health.\n\nAnother thing I wanted to point out is that even while depressed, the majority of the comments in my post still treat a relationship as naturally as anyone else. It's just another thing in their lives they can actively pursue if they choose to, unlike us here where a relationship is akin to finding a unicorn. And I think that's really what drove home for me how broken and unwanted I really was.\n\nWhat I also noticed in my post is that many people 'got lucky' finding their SO. Some of these lucky people got lucky finding another mentally ill person! Now, maybe they did get lucky. Maybe it's because they're attractive. The evidence is circumstantial. But it still kind of sucks that we're the unlucky ones. Why that is, well... who knows.\n\nMany people in my depression post, understandably, recommended to not pursue a relationship until I've improved myself and am in a better mental state. And this is related to my first point: this is much easier to do that with the encouragement, support, and validation given by a significant other. Of course, sometimes this can backfire. Of course, this can be substituted with friends and family. I have a feeling the latter isn't so easily available to us either.\n\nIn the end, this is what many of us are missing. Encouragement, support, and validation. A significant other is simply the ultimate personification of this. Maybe our family didn't give it to us in our childhood. Maybe we didn't have friends to build our confidence. And in the end, if you're trying to do the Herculean effort that is coping with your depression on your own...\n\nGood luck with that.\n\nThe thread in questions is [here](https://np.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/aempj3/i_have_to_wonder_how_the_flying_fuck_do_people/).\n\n", "subreddit": "ForeverAlone"}

Honestly, for a \"loser\" like me, I should be happy that a girl was once attracted to me. Why did I get my hopes up that we will share a life together? She is like a 10 and I am like a 0 by US standard. I really don't fit in the US, the culture is so different in comparison to Asia. Most people just drink to hang out. I hated that, I like to actually do things like outdoor adventure, traveling, music, cooking... but I am viewed as a loser by everyone because I am no Alpha male that get drunk at the bar every night. \n\nThe past 4 years went by super fast, looking back, I am still stuck in the memory. Everything I knew about her is from 4 years ago, other than being very cold to me at times, she is still very cute and sweet when she see me. The volunteering program was something we created together, one of our little ways to contribute to society, hoping to inspire kids to take a career in science. The only connection we have left is this program, she only talk to me and see me if it is about this program. Her bf really hate me I guess... she said he asked me not to talk to her about anything other than this program. I was hurt, really really hurt. \n\nThen fast forward to recent days, she seems to be a bit more comfortable around me now. A lot more friendly at least... I only know scattered pieces of her life from the past 4 years, and she is surprise to find out I don't know her that well. I sorta have a feeling that she moved in with her boyfriend and I somewhat confirmed that today via a mutual friend.  \n\nI was very down at the volunteering activity today, but I got to pretend to be fine in front of the kids right?

When are you and him getting married?\n\nA: Oh, we are looking at a house at ______.\n\nC: I heard the houses at the waterfront are good.\n\nA: Yeah they are so pretty....\n\nMy heart fell into the sea. I could barely breathe and instantly wanted to be buried by torrents of earth and sucked to the bottom of the planet.

By that, I don't mean I have friends that I feel lonely with, or friends who I don't feel comfortable with, I don't mean friends who are always going out without me, not friends who I secretly wonder if they dislike me, or anything like that. I'm also not trying to say that I have friendly acquaintances who I can't take the next step with. I mean zero friends, zero people to talk to, zero people to hang out with.\n\nI live with my mom and dad, they're both kind of as friendless as I am so we just stay at home all day. I used to talk to my mom a lot, but now I honestly can't anymore, because I realized that the way she dismisses everything I've been through and all the difficulty I have in living a normal life was making me resent her a lot, and I don't want to stop loving her. So now I just avoid her, last time we sat down and had a conversation was several months ago.\n\nHaving no one to talk to and all this free time is, to put it shortly, painful. This is pain like I've never experienced in my life, and I've been through some shit. I sometimes read a book, other times I watch a movie or a video, usually without enjoying it, and as soon as it's over I just sit and try hard to think about what to do next. Most of the times I can't think of anything, and I just feel like crying.\n\nObviously, like everyone, I have plenty of things I want to do in theory, but I don't want to do them in practice anymore. Loneliness completely destroys your drive to do anything. It makes you realize how we're all social beings deep down, and it feels pointless to perform tasks in a social vacuum. I realized our brains are wired to only enjoy something if it can somehow connect it to a social purpose, otherwise it feels pointless. The last man alive on the planet wouldn't be able to enjoy a movie or a videogame, and that's how I'm feeling now.\n\nI honestly don't know what to do until march. I'm honestly terrified that I might go insane. And of course, when I'm back at the uni routine then the only thing that changes is that I'll finally be alone among other people again, which is shit but feels great compared to this.", "subreddit": "lonely"}

Well it doesn't really matter anyways. \n\nI'm just barely 17 years old, and my social life is slowly flushing down the toilet. I only have male friends, and their friends make fun of me on a daily basis for no fucking reason that I understand, either because I'm too smart or too dumb. My class is 99% male except for a single girl, since I'm studying the construction line in my local ''gymnasium'' (Swedish equivalent for high school/college), and that girl almost never comes to work. Almost none of the girls in my entire school seem interested, and me neither since around 65% of them are muslim and the others would probably laugh at me. And if they don't, my friends will probably do, which will make the girl embarrassed and dump me.\n\nWhy wouldn't they? Here's some pathetic, depressing facts about myself:\n\n* I'm a shorty at around 5'5 in one of the most tallest countries in the entire world, and since the Swedish girls want tall Swedish boys, and I'm not attracted to muslim girls, I'm fucked (sadly, non-literally).\n* I have a babyface, so I look like I'm 13 when I'm actually 17, my short height is what makes it even worse. Girls call me that typical annoying bullshit about how ''cute'' or ''sweet'' I am. How many times do I have to say: I'm NOT 13 years old?!?!\n* I'm physically weak, the only reason I got into this line of work was because It was either this or the ''Estet'' line, which is basically painting shit which gives you next to no actually useful education. I have gone to a gym, but I can't say it will really help unless I become a buffed up boxer, which will take years of hard work.\n* I'm shy as fuck, I can't approach a single girl because I never get a chance to do it away from my or her friends. If I saw a girl and no one else was around, I would definetly do it. For example there's this girl from my middle school class that lives near me, but I've never seen her outside for a few months, only in school. She's pretty funny and kinda hot too, but my only communication to her is via Snapchat, and that's not very good. It would be fucking awkward to tell her through some text.\n* I have dyspraxia which is like a combination of dyslexia and some tiny bits of Autism, along with coordination disorder. So not only am I shy, I also get confused and I'm pretty clumsy.

Wait, I joined to meet people and I shouldn't have done those things to meet people but for the hobby or to help people. They can sense that. You should join hobby groups to meet people but you should never join hobby groups just to meet people. It's about your passion for the hobby. People like someone who is passionate about hobbies, as long as they are socially acceptable. \n\nI hate being my socially awkward autistic self. If anyone wants to lecture me about how to stop being toxic, it's like going to Chernobyl and spraying an air freshener. ", "subreddit": "ForeverAlone"}

A friend at the club said they could get me on the list.\n\nI went to the cocktail party and HOLY MOLY the food was amazing. There were so many trays of fancy stuff plus a chocolate fondue.\n\nBut I had come to meet women, because I knew there would be many women there. Here's how my efforts went.\n\n*Girl 1*: Had a great conversation shortly after I walked in. We work in the same profession. Had trouble finding her the rest of the night, seeing her only once much later on when she was talking to another guy. Didn't see her again.\n\n*Girl 2*: never got beyond introductions. Soon afterwards I noticed that I kept ending up near the garbage cans, where there was a small space due to the layout of the room. Since she was nearby, I joked to her that I always end up at the garbage because I'm garbage.\n\nMultiple times that night I found myself in the middle of the crowd, surrounded by pockets of chatting people yet feeling isolated and unable to join.\n\nI got depressed and sulked on a bench at the side of the party for quite some time. A very kind and attractive man reached out to me, listened to me lament about my romantic history, and gave me some basic advice like \"sit up straight\". He introduced me to *girl 3*, with whom I never got past introductions, but she did compliment my dance moves as I was leaving. Eventually I psyched myself up and got back in the fray.\n\n*Girl 4*: my biggest disappointment of the night. We met near the entrance where the music wasn't too loud, we talked and laughed and I thought everything was great. I felt significant attraction to her. I stepped away for a moment to get some food, and a man and woman started talking to her. I hung around for a while trying to catch her eye, but then she and the woman (her friend, I presume) walked away. I kept hanging around trying to talk to her for a while, but they were always talking.\n\nI had to retreat to the restroom briefly. I considered telephoning a friend for support, but in the end I just prayed. I might be an atheist but I still reach out to God once in a while when I'm desperate. It worked, even though I didn't finish the prayer.\n\nI met another helpful man who listened to me and gave some useful encouragement, but then a loud and obnoxious guy who seemed like he was drunk (even though no alcohol was served?) started talking to us and basically stole the conversation. When I hadn't had a chance to talk for five minutes straight I walked away and saw neither of them again.\n\nThere's more to this story, but these incidents form the gist of it. And with such difficulties at a mild party with mildly loud music, what good would a club do me? I simply went home.\n\nAnd to add insult to injury, I discovered shortly before getting home that I'd left behind my favourite hat.\n\nBut seriously you wouldn't believe how good the food was.", "subreddit": "ForeverAlone"}

In this post: [https://www.reddit.com/r/ForeverAlone/comments/ab5n1z/welp\\_im\\_gonna\\_do\\_it/](https://www.reddit.com/r/ForeverAlone/comments/ab5n1z/welp_im_gonna_do_it/), I committed to said exercise, in addition to outlining some parameters. Because few bars are open, and few people attend bars, on weekdays, however, I have since amended the exercise; now aiming to speak to three women on Fridays, three on Saturdays and three on Sundays, for the four weekends of January, for a total of 36. The following post comprises my fifth such account, my account of the night of 13/01/2019.\n\nAfter having to skip two nights due to other commitments, I resumed the exercise tonight. Alas, there is little to report. Tonight\u2019s Meetup was at a bowling alley. I did speak, very briefly, to three women (so all the same, I consider my quota for the night fulfilled), but in each case, after their turn to bowl was over, they went off to talk to other people.\n\nNevertheless, though, I had a fun time bowling, and food + drink was on the house. In light of this, I cannot recommend Meetups enough to people on this sub. If all you want is a facsimile of a \u201cnormie\u201d social life \u2013 going out in the evening, bowling, eating pizza and drinking beer or red bull, casually chatting to people, having people clap and cheer for you when you score a strke, etc. \u2013 then Meetups seem to be a pretty effortless way to attain one. Just look up: \u201cMeetups\u201d on Google, followed by the name of your city, shop around for some bar-crawling ones or for some pertinent to your personal interests, join them, sign up for their next sessions, and head over when the dates arrive. It\u2019s easy, and a lot more productive, I would have thought, than just staying home in the evenings moping. I\u2019m sorry if I sound rude here, but I'm trying to offer constructive advice based on personal experience. I'm not claiming to know what anybody else's personal circumstances are, but unless you suffer from truly severe, debilitating social anxiety, then I really don\u2019t think that socialization could possibly be as hard as many people here seem to make it out to be.\n\n\u2026please don\u2019t flame\u2026\n\n**Tally:**\n\nGoal: 36.\n\nPoints: 10.\n\nBrownie points: 4.\n\nRejections: 0.\n\nPhone numbers: 1.\n\nAgain; ***polite***, ***constructive***, ***good faith*** suggestions are appreciated.", "subreddit": "ForeverAlone"}

Due to severe overwork and pressure i had several anxiety attacks. Both at work as with my friends. Saw my friends getting married, have kids and whatever...meanwhile my social anxiety got worse and everyone started fading away. \n\nIt quited my hobby (cause the level we played was my thing, but i could handle the pressure that came with it; i started playing for fun, got a talent for it and then went into the higher leagues and the pressure that came with it), same with my  work. Pressure was to much. Quit. Stayed home for 2 years. Now i am back in the saddle working for way less money but i like the work i do. I still have serious social anxiety. Every day i am exhausted. Not really by the work, but pure on getting pass my anxiety during the day. Shopping is hell, havent been out in 8 years beside work. \n\nLive at parents house but they are gone like 300 days a year so most of time i am alone there. Spended last newyear alone and went to bed at 2100. And now that my sister got a kid almost any leftover attention goes to the kid. Thankfully i have a dog which keeps my company but its not the same.\n\nI have given hope on finding love up ages ago.

How i went from passive to being an ego maniac.", "author": "your_godammn_right", "self_text": "I guess this change was most probably involuntary because I was 18 when it happened and this is the age a personality disorder can develop or only be diagnosed at. Age 7-11 I was always sort of the \"aspie\" in the corner kid, very fearful of risks, severe attachment and separation anxiety, crying at school, feeling abandoned when separated from my mother. At age 14-16 I went through a selfie \"fake confidence\" phase where I would experience very high vanity to very low vanity which swung occasionally. At age 16 I developed a more genuine mask and protective ego, this happened through all the rejection I had faced, all the passive aggressive bullying from my brothers, the mistreatment from my mother who has psychopathic traits. Eventually I developed a sense of grandiosity and a inflated ego. At age 18 this became pathological and at this stage I had fully transitioned into a narcissist. It was also at this stage that I started lacking empathy, became defensive, arrogant, and engaging in manipulation. Now at 20 I just live to be different from Everyone, I get pleasure from triggering people and exploiting women for my own personal controlling needs. I guess I'm a \" mildly self aware toxic\" person? . I will never be truly confident so I love my grandiose fantasies and unrecognized talents. Most people can be manipulated easy, I have fantasies of becoming a fake alpha male, e.g pretending when really I'm an arrogant emotional abuser. I love how I can do what I want when I want too! I suffer from severe internalized closeted misanthropy and will try be my most provocative I can. There is hope brothers, be who you wanna be regardless what these fools in society think.\n\n\nI was diagnosed with OCD, borderline personality disorder (BPD not bipolar), narcissistic personality traits (NPD-Traits). \nAlso guys medication really helps! I still suffer from terrible terrible phone anxiety though, and still act awkward in enclosed social situations but am now very confident and extroverted in big open spaces like clubs and bars, I on average kiss one girl every time I go out. Medication cured my mild agoraphobia, most of my OCD, however I need therapy for my BPD. \n\nTldr: you can't just become a narcissist, its natural, you need to have a very fragile personality and the environmental and/or biological make up for it. Tldr: was abused, which lead to societal resistance which turned me into a narcissist.

He's already been diagnosed depressed so hearing his comments about being FA were concerning. \n\n\nI was hoping I'd be able to get some advice to maybe help him along so he doesn't end up becoming miserable. We're both 20 and have known each other for 2 years now. He's honestly a pretty involved guy in our small mid-west campus. Socially he isn't inept either, just a little awkward at times but who isn't? Anyway, hes expressed feelings of never being able to find a girl, and that hes still a hand hold/kissless virgin at age 20. I really want to help him as he's one of my best friends, but I don't want to seem condescending or anything...\n\n\nMy girlfriend and I have tried to set up double dates with one of her friends, and he is never too receptive, I've brought him out to parties and introduced him to girls and the conversation doesn't seem to last more than the introductions as he is a little introverted. He doesn't drink so that isn't an option to loosen him up. He's not a bad looking dude, maybe a little overweight but could do alright for himself. Overall he doesn't do bad for himself I guess he just isn't able to \"close\" and constantly says he's being friendzoned when he does try.\n\n\nMy main question I guess would be, do I continue to try and push him in the right direction (gym, taking him out, introducing to women etc) or let him try and figure it out on his own? I want to give him better than just the BS \"just get out there bro\" and \"shower and dress nice bro\" shit.

{"post_id": "afs3nb", "created_utc": 1547440229, "title": "I suspect for many FA people, the main cause and problem is a bad mental state", "author": "is_reddit_useful", "self_text": "I could say I'm FA in terms of lack of offline friends or a partner. But what really matters to me is not these facts but the apparently inferior quality of life compared when I see people having a better time with friends and/or partners.\n\nExperiences where socializing worked properly seemed to confirm that it makes me feel a lot better. However, these experiences were rare and I had many frustrating experiences where I was among people but unable to interact in a meaningful or satisfying way.\n\nIt seems that being in a bad state makes me unable to socialize. The problem is that I see people behaving a certain way during recreational socializing, and I want to behave that way, but that behaviour is an expression of a certain emotional state, which is much better than my own state. I'm so far from that state that it's difficult to even fake that state, and painful to fake it because it puts how much my own state sucks in perspective.\n\nThere are various observations I can use to support the hypothesis that my own state sucks.\n\n * I've seen how when I'm in a good state various common social behaviours seem a lot more natural and easy. I mean things like waving at neighbours when coming home, really expressing a sense of gratitude when saying thanks, expressing something positive in greetings in general, and so on. Even some interactions with strangers which might be called smalltalk are an expression of something positive.\n\n * My own thoughts are often negative, involving patterns of worry, which while not a totally repetitive loop tend to involve only a few different thought \"sentences\". I've seen how I can talk very freely and naturally when I really talk about what's on my mind, but if I try to socializing in a positive recreational way while my mind is full of this shit, it doesn't work.\n\n * I've seen how ability to laugh at things depends on my own state. When I'm in a bad state, seeing someone embarrass themselves in fiction on TV can be so extremely painful that it is hard to continue watching the show. In an exceptionally good state, I can laugh at that, which feels very good.\n\n * I've seen how my own level of compassion for other people varies with state. In a bad state I might feel anxiety about conforming to expected social roles and guilt if I think I'm not conforming. In a good state I instead feel compassion, and seem to make more rational choices.\n\n * The general way many people arrange various things in their life  (like interior design of living spaces, use of art and decorative objects, architecture, and even maybe making computer desktops look nice) seems to indicate a higher level of appreciation for things which I only occasionally glimpse. I'm often too narrowly focused to seem to benefit from such things.\n\n * When in a bad state I repeated the same patterns of behaviour too much, not exploring possible variations. This also includes not exploring possibilities for socializing. I've seen how in a better state I have a drive to explore.\n\n * I've seen how a bad state creates a bias toward seeing defects and risks in everything and everyone, including various courses of action and other people. This is probably a big part of what makes me stick to the familiar.\n\nI'm not really sure what to call the bad state. One obvious possibility is depression, but I'm not sure it really fits, and no professional ever said it really fits. It's probably mainly a result of trauma.\n\nThe avoidant motivation described here in general could be called anxiety. But I don't think that explains it. When I'm in a bad state and trying to behave differently and express recreational socializing behaviours that people in a better state express, that causes a kind of anxiety. But this is not simply an anxiety about doing something, where if I just got past the anxiety things would be good. Even if I got past the anxiety, the emotional basis for the desired behaviour simply isn't there. Yet when I am in a good state I don't need to fight much anxiety, and it can simply work.\n\nCertainly there is a feedback loop here, with loneliness making me feel worse and because of that putting me in a state where it is hard to socialize.\n\nEven when things seem to work, maybe they're not really working well. Maybe when I do socialize then because of the state I'm in maybe I take more than I give emotionally. I can't rationally justify this statement, but intuitively, it seems like I have a sense of how one makes a positive emotional contribution to others states and an understanding that I don't do that very much. Maybe not understanding this and/or not being able to contribute, I effectively wanted others to make me feel good via socializing, and because of that I was undesirable.\n\nThis bad state I'm talking about here isn't just a problem with socializing. It is a problem for all sorts of motivation, and basically anything which gets out of the repetitive patterns in a comfort zone. Inability to socialize offline just seems like the worst problem resulting from it.", "subreddit": "ForeverAlone"}

I am letting go of my regrets and the things I have done in the past that have held me down for so long.  I don't think I want to share what I did publicly, especially since it's very circumstance-specific and it isn't for everyone.

I used to resent 'normies' who told me to work out, go outdoors more, and meet people, but I came to realize they were just trying to help.  These people are right, the problem is that they present it in a way that sounds too simple.  Go outdoors doesn't mean walk around a public park; it means find activities that you have a strong passion for that aren't within the confines of your home.  You will naturally meet and talk to people in the process.  Even if it's something like playing Magic in a hobby shop, there are communities for almost everything.  It is true they don't understand our pain, but venting without even trying to change won't take you anywhere.

Guys who can\u2019t figure out a way to attract women blindly bash their head against the wall with this phrase in mind, quietly hoping that they can win her over with enough kindness and courtesy a.k.a. \u201cgood boy points\u201d.\n\nWomen don\u2019t necessarily want to be mistreated, but they do like to be challenged. And by that I mean that they expect men to treat them with flippant disregard. Let me give you some examples from my own personal experience. \n\nI work in an all-female coffee shop. I\u2019m the only man there, so I get a lot of chances to observe how they act around me, and the male customers. When I first started working there, I let them direct me. I didn\u2019t know what I was doing, so I let them guide me until I felt confident doing every task by myself. I treated them as equals, and I was nice to them. If they were in my way, I would calmly and politely ask them if they could move. I listened and obeyed when they would ask me to do things.\n\nEventually, they started to walk all over me. They realized that I was so determined to be polite and helpful that I would do almost anything they asked in order to be liked and appreciated. They unloaded the tasks that they didn\u2019t want onto me. I didn\u2019t feel respected at all.\n\nThings changed when I noticed how some of the male customers treated them. Again, not with disrespect, but sort of a commanding firmness. \n\n\u201cRemake it.\u201d stated an older man who was dissatisfied with his coffee. He didn\u2019t get angry, he just asked them to do it for him in a commanding tone. \u201cYessir!\u201d they said as they scrambled to help him out. \u201cThanks.\u201d he said without even looking in their direction and walked off. I commented on how rude he was, but the girls were quick to deny it, as if they actually liked being ordered around. \n\nI started practicing that same kind of firmness. If one of the girls asked me to go to the back and get the pastries, I\u2019d simply say, \u201cNo, I\u2019m washing the dishes first. It\u2019ll have to wait\u201d.  And if one of them got onto me for doing something wrong, I\u2019d just smirk and laugh it off. \n\nI began noticing that they were nicer to me after I kept this up for awhile. They preferred it when I \u201cfought back\u201d, or acted like I didn\u2019t care what they thought. \n\nI still don\u2019t fucking get it. What I\u2019m doing is fundamentally rude, it\u2019s disrespectful, and I don\u2019t like acting that way. But women encourage this behavior by rewarding me with kindness and basic respect when I do it. I think that they have started to associate bright-eyed positivity, kindness, and optimism with gay men, or men who are incapable of protecting or providing for them; men who have no apparent use.\n\nMaybe I\u2019m reading too much into this, but this is what I\u2019ve observed.\n", "subreddit": "ForeverAlone"}

As a result, their interests and values can change quickly.\n\nPeople with borderline personality disorder also tend to view things in extremes, such as all good or all bad. Their opinions of other people can also change quickly. An individual who is seen as a friend one day may be considered an enemy or traitor the next. These shifting feelings can lead to intense and unstable relationships.\n\nOther signs or symptoms may include:\n\n- Efforts to avoid real or imagined abandonment, such as rapidly initiating intimate (physical or emotional) relationships or cutting off communication with someone in anticipation of being abandoned\n- A pattern of intense and unstable relationships with family, friends, and loved ones, often swinging from extreme closeness and love (idealization) to extreme dislike or anger (devaluation)\n- Distorted and unstable self-image or sense of self\n- Impulsive and often dangerous behaviors, such as spending sprees, unsafe sex, substance abuse, reckless driving, and binge eating.\u00a0Please note:\u00a0If these behaviors occur primarily during a period of elevated mood or energy, they may be signs of a mood disorder\u2014not borderline personality disorder\n- Self-harming behavior, such as cutting\n- Recurring thoughts of suicidal behaviors or threats\n- Intense and highly changeable moods, with each episode lasting from a few hours to a few days\n- Chronic feelings of emptiness\n- Inappropriate, intense anger or problems controlling anger\n- Difficulty trusting, which is sometimes accompanied by irrational fear of other people\u2019s intentions\n- Feelings of dissociation, such as feeling cut off from oneself, seeing oneself from outside one\u2019s body, or feelings of unreality\n\nNot everyone with borderline personality disorder experiences every symptom. Some individuals experience only a few symptoms, while others have many. Symptoms can be triggered by seemingly ordinary events. For example, people with borderline personality disorder may become angry and distressed over minor separations from people to whom they feel close, such as traveling on business trips.

About 15 years ago I was friends with a girl I worked with. She was 18 and I was 26 at the time. She is really the last person who hung out with me on a regular basis. She was cute and a little miserable like I was but fun too. We would go out for coffee and ice cream every couple weeks. Technically she was my last date. We would chat on instant message a few times a week. She would flirt with me heavily, telling me stuff like she would fuck me or whatever, but it was always haha you're too young and haha I know I'm just playing or she would have a boyfriend and she would go quiet on me for awhile. If I was a complete dirtbag I probably could have gotten something from her, we certainly had enough moments alone after dark in cars or on park benches....but I never made the move. I miss her tremendously now but I know she has moved away, gone to college, has a good and important job and has lived life and I'm still the same piece of shit I was 15 years ago. I can only imagine if she saw me know if she'd be repulsed at how little I've grown or changed or think \"God, he was hanging out with an 18 year old girl what a creep\". Maybe she wouldn't. She was a good soul when I knew her. But she's almost certainly lapped me in life. I saw she had a plenty of fish account with no picture and I was like \"oh my god this girl should not have to be searching\" but who knows maybe she was alone for a week and thought she'd try it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI mentioned here before the last time I saw her face to face she told me maybe I should get a prostitute to lose my virginity. I was looking at these chat logs and crying. In the years prior to that night, she said \"I'll bet substantial money you will find someone someday\" \"There is no way you'll end up alone you are great\" \"If you can't find someone I won't either\". Chalk it up to being 18 and being naive. Maybe she gave up on me and that last time and what she said was a sign of that. I knew then she would never be with me. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI live with these memories. They barely keep me warm at night. But they haunt me too. Like ghosts I can see her inches away from me. And I did nothing. Probably my last shot at happiness in life.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI don't know how much more I can take.

I'm torn between leaving and staying. Honestly, it sucks. Living in this limbo is probably the worst place to be in, but that's not the main reason why I'm writing. I'm writing this to look back at myself and see where I've come from and maybe see if I can help another along the way. So here it is.\n\nThe earliest memory I have of myself is when I was probably around four or five years old, playing Jak and Dexter on the PlayStation 2 trying to get over this dumb fishing mini-game that seemed impossible to accomplish. That's where my Dad came in. He was always the one to help me through it and, with his lightning speed reactions and marksman-like accuracy, he somehow beat the level every time. I always wondered how he could beat such a fast-paced level with such ease until I got older but right then and there I knew he'd be my hero forever.\n\nBack then I lived with my Mom and Dad in an older wooden two-story house. We had an elderly couple that lived next door who would have barbecues and invite us over to eat all the time. They were nice, I forgot their names but they somehow stuck with me. Their hospitality and friendly nature is something I could never forget. When my parents were away the couple would let me come over and babysit me until my parents got back. They were good people and now, sadly, they're probably gone. Anyways, as I can remember our house had three rooms and one bathroom upstairs and the living room, dining room, and another bathroom downstairs. Though I don't remember the color or distinct features of our house, I can remember shards of experiences I had in them. Like the one time I positioned my fingers so that the only one up was the middle finger pointing at my Mom. As I asked her what it meant she got upset and told me to stop it, but I was relentless. I wasn't putting that finger away until she told me what it meant. Of course, she only got more upset at my insubordinate behavior and yelled at me to put it down. That's when I began to cry and ran over to my Dad, who was working non-stop at his, what's now ancient, computer, and told him what happened. He shrugged it off and that's all I can remember. There was another time when I was up in my room playing with toys. I had this shopping cart while ran around like a marathon runner picking up and dropping off groceries in certain spots of my room. One corner was the store and the other was our house. The most potent thing I can remember from that time was my happiness. My childlike nature and innocence were there. Everything in the world was blissful and perfect. It was heaven.\n\nFast forward a few years and my parents divorced. I was probably five to seven by the time this happened and was confused, probably like most kids, for a majority of it. \"Was it my fault?\" That question lingered around my mind constantly. All the time I would ask why \"Mommy and Daddy didn't love each other anymore,\" in which they would respond with the usual \"We still love each other buddy, we're just taking a break.\" That's where the backseat became a familiar landscape for me. For most weekends I'd travel up and down the state of Michigan to see my Mom or Dad until I was fourteen. The drive was about three in a half hours to get downstate and it was dreadful. The boorishness of sitting and watching the same things go by and by for so many years of my life was a real downer. My PsP was the only thing that made the trip somewhat bearable but after 2 hours of looking down at the screen your neck starts to feel like a knife was lodged in it while your eyes began to feel like they're drooping. So I drugged through it. Later in life, I got to be free of the constant car rides when my Mom moved to California where most of her family is. In between that time I felt as if I had two lives which molded the very foundation of me. Though, before all of that I had to make the biggest decision of my life.\n\nOne day as I was playing GTA San Andreas for the Xbox (yes, I may have been too young at around seven years old to play that but I was damn good at it) Mom came into the room with Dad on the phone. She had tears rolling down her face as she asked me who I wanted to live with for the weekdays. In other words, she was asking who I wanted to spend the majority of my life with. I sat there baffled by what was happening. One second I was shooting animated gangsters on the street with a controller and the next I was making a life-changing decision. I broke down. I sobbed and sobbed for what felt like an eternity. The pain I had was something I never felt before that moment. The millions of icicles that jabbed repeatedly turned in my heart. It was too much. I wanted to disappear. I wanted to go to a black void where it was only me. A place where I could be alone. A place where only my thoughts existed, nothing else. I couldn't though. I had to make my decision. To be honest, the reason for my choice, looking back, was funny. I don't remember thinking about who was the better parent or who I even liked more, though that may have been part, the most vivid thing I can remember was that my Dad was a guy and I'm a guy so I should be with him. So I chose my Dad. Weird right? I chose my Dad because he was a dude like me. Looking back, it's funny how things could've been so much different. I feel like if I was a girl that scenario would've been opposite. At the same time though, I guess my Dad never yelled at me for no reason which probably helped. Of course, I never told either one why I chose my Dad (for obvious reasons) and that's broke my life into two pieces. Two semi-parallel but at the same time intersecting lives. Mom and Dad.\n\nMy father's part of my life was enjoyable for the most part that I can remember. We lived in the northern part of the lower peninsula of Michigan in a small town with my grandparents for two years starting from second grade. My grandparents were the kindest people I could ever know for my childhood. Grandpa had his own business and wasn't home much while grandma was home always cooking up something good to eat. When Grandpa got home he'd give me a big ol' hug which squeezed the breath outta me. He'd then sneak me a Popsicle here and there when grandma wasn't watching. He was that kind of guy. Kind and sly all at the same time. I loved them and I still do. My Dad also had two brothers and one sister who were different in their own ways. My aunt was brown-haired, large, and always had an arrogant tone in her voice. She was kind but intimidating to talk to. My two uncles, one blonde and the other dark-haired, stood at about the same average height with medium size to them. They were like older brothers to me. One playing Modern Warfare and Black Ops with me while the other talked to me about life whenever he could. They're great, probably some of the best uncles I could've ever asked for. Then there was my Dad. He was the guy that got me into video games. The man that beat that annoying fishing level on Jak and Dexter. The man that stood next to me all my life. There were other parts of my Dad's side of the family, a funny uncle here, a crazy aunt there, but for the most part, they were awesome. And boy did my Dad and uncles play the guitar. Almost every day it seemed like my Dad would pull out his chocolate brown Peavey Wolfgang and completely shred. He'd play songs from Metallica, Avenged Sevenfold, Dragon Force, and bands I've never even heard of and he'd just go to town with them. My uncles were great musicians as well, I'm honestly surprised they aren't in a band right now. They were so talented. I, on the other hand, played the violin. I always thought it was so cool to see the bow move across the strings almost like an engine's pistons pushing and pulling vigorously within a transmission. I wasn't too good at it. I played from middle school up to freshman year in High school and sat fourth to fifth chair most of the time (not too good). Anyways, I digress. This is mostly about my father after all. He was and still is a good man. He always tried to make me smile and play catch whenever he could. He'd make spaghetti and steak because that's all he could really make but damn it was good. He loved me with all his heart. Really, after Mom left him I think I became the only thing he cared about. Later in life, I started to push away from him as most typical angsty teens do with their parents and it's changed everything. That's for later though, now's the time for my Mom.\n\nMy Mom is a complete flip-flop of my Dad even in terms of family. She lived down south almost at the border of Michigan and Indiana. The drive down, as I said before, sucked balls. Being there wasn't the best. Now the more I try to analyze my relationship with my Mom I start to feel that I'm too hard on her. Most memories I have about her really aren't the best and I know that we've had better times but I can't seem to get them into focus. It's like trying to focus on the moon when it's full but a dark cloud rushes to block it every time you look up. I can't find the good parts. She never liked me playing video games and worried that I \"was too young,\" and would \"turn violent,\" if I kept playing them. She had a point, I'll give her that, but the way she conveyed it was all wrong. Every time the issue would arise it would turn into her yelling. I don't know how it'd even get that way but it did. She'd yell and yell and all I can remember is me sitting there taking it one blow at a time. I know there had to have been better times like going to Disney land or some shit like that but I can't seem to remember it. She used to have a cool boyfriend though, I'll call him H for now. H was a great guy to me. He had a messed up back so all he could really do is sit on a chair and recover, but as he did that he'd ask me to play video games for him. No one's ever asked me to do that before. He wasn't too good at most games but loved the story so he enjoyed watching me play games like Batman Arkham Knight and Mafia II. It made me feel appreciated. It was a symbiotic relationship we had. He'd pretty much be watching an action-packed movie while I was playing an epic game. I loved it. I miss it. H was always nice to me too. Never the type of boyfriend that ignored you or didn't really think you mattered; rather, the type to actually care about you. He was like another Dad. After about four years of knowing him and his wonderful family, he proposed to my Mom on Christmas day. She said yes while tearing up. It was funny because of how oblivious I was to the whole situation. We were at H's parent's house opening gifts and I was the hat wearer (the person that handed out the gifts) and while he was proposing, I was looking for the next present while loudly shouting \"WHO'S TURN IS IT?!\" then turning around to see H on one knee proposing to Mom. It goes without saying that I was pretty embarrassed, but they didn't seem to mind. All they did was smile at each other. It was the first time in a while that Mom wasn't upset. Five months later my Mom told me she was moving to California to be with her family over there. The two things she forgot to mention was the real reason why she left and that I wasn't going to see H ever again. I was around twelve at the time and when I grew up to fourteen it really started to hit me. Looking back at their relationship, they did tend to fight a lot. Yelling and screaming about God knows what while I tried to play video games or sleep in my room. I blocked it out I guess. And then it all started to come back to me. I traveled to California for the Summers following her leaving and confronted her about it. She dodged the question here and there which was frustrating to say the least, but one time her sister (my aunt) slipped and said H cheated on her. Ouch. I began to understand my Mom. I could finally see her angle on the world and understood her reasoning. It still hurt though. He made a horrible decision and now he's gone. At times I'd think to myself that yes he did a bad thing, but he was still my friend. He still cared about me, right? At least that's what I thought. His family was awesome too. I wanted to see them all again but Mom wouldn't let me. I guess now it doesn't matter. After another few years, we did start to visit H's family, but not him. He apparently stopped interacting with them and vice versa. Jeez. Why do I write this? Whatever. To continue on my Mom, she went to California around the time I was twelve and had two kids, my half-brothers, with a guy we'll call O. O isn't H at all. He's the kind of guy that'll say \"You're either a football player or a pussy,\" that kind of guy. The kind of guy that makes fun of gamers like me and had some sort of animosity towards a good bit of the world for no reason. At least Mom loves him. That's when things started to take a turn.\n\nWhen I turned fifteen my Mom wanted me to come out to California for a part of the Summer. After a long talk, we agreed on me staying out there for a week and things were fine. Come to find out she sends the emailed tickets to me and I see that she arranged it so I'd be in California for three weeks. Now I know that may not seem like a big deal but that's how my Mom tended to work. She'd make plans with my Dad to meet halfway to pick me up (back when she lived in Michigan) and bail out or make him drive the whole way. After so many times of that kind of shit, it got aggravating. She was breaking an important principle to me which was keeping your word, and I called her about it. I asked her why she got the tickets to be three weeks instead of one like we previously agreed upon. That's when she started to break down and cry. She told me about how when she was my age her mother died and only wanted to spend all the time she could with her. She essentially made me feel like a piece of shit. A person who didn't appreciate his mother the same way she did. I started to tear up and agreed that I'd come out for the three weeks, and after she hanged up I began to sob. I entered the conversation feeling confident that she couldn't dodge her way out of this one and left with tears running down my cheeks. She got me. She always knew how to. I vented this out to my Dad and grandma which they saw no wrong in what I did. Yes, we can all agree that one week for the Summer may be a bit short to spend with your mother but we both made an agreement. An agreement she didn't have to slither her way under to break. An agreement that was concrete. It didn't matter I guess. I went for my three weeks and left feeling resentment for my Mom. She's the only person in the world to make me feel that way. The way no parent should make their kids feel. She used the same tactic again and again and sometimes clumped my two new brothers in there to really sweeten the guilt I had. Don't get me wrong, I love my brothers with all my heart and for the times I went out there I wanted to save them from becoming anything like my Mom or O. My efforts were futile. No matter how many times I go out there I know I won't be able to save them. They'll probably end up being jocks with self-entitled attitudes like their parents.\n\nThis sucks you know. All of this. Life. I know it's not supposed to be easy but God damn it hurts. Why are you here? If you've read this far then you obviously care but why? Doesn't this suck? Isn't this boring? I'm sorry, I don't mean to be rude, I just don't understand anything anymore. My friends, my relationships, myself. I haven't even gotten to those parts yet but how can I? I know I said this was for me to look back on but it's for you too. For you to escape I guess. Thank you for coming this far, as boring as it is. I've never really enjoyed English class. It was too wish-washy for me, nothing like numbers. Math makes sense to me. Finding the tone of a piece of writing is so much more difficult for me to wrap my mind around unlike solving the integral of sin(x). I guess what I'm trying to say is that writing isn't my strong suit. Thank you for bearing with me. Let's continue.\n\nLet's get more into me as a person. My academic life has been decent so far. I struggled in some areas like English class, but after putting in the hours of studying and rewriting, I'd say I've overcome most of those struggles. Besides academics, I wouldn't say I'm a selfish person. My grandparents always taught me respect, confidence, and honesty when it came to interacting with others. My Dad reinforced this while my Mom showed me how to be sly, rude, self-entitled, and a liar. I always tried to stray away from her personality but to be honest, I've probably appealed to her sly and liar-like traits more than I should've. Deep down, though, I've always liked to help others with their issues. I don't know exactly why, especially since I've got plenty of them myself, I guess seeing that smile on someone's face warms my heart as corny as that sounds. It's weird. Maybe it helps me forget about my own problems. I really don't know, but I always have the urge to help. Even when I can't exactly help others directly I always try to smile and be humorous around them. It's crazy to think that when I'm alone I almost never smile; there's nothing to smile about then. When I'm around others I notice that I'm always smiling even when I'm severely depressed. It's like a paradoxical mask I can't take off. I started to wonder if everyone does that. Maybe we're all wearing that same mask. \"The saddest people smile the brightest,\" I believe I heard Robin Williams say this (or something like that) and I've thought about it a lot. I really shouldn't be smiling but I do. I don't necessarily want to but I do. I want to say that \"I can't handle it anymore,\" but I don't. We all don't say it. Why? Why endure this torture? Is it because we're scared of rejection from our peers? Is it that we don't want to burden others with our problems? Is it that those above us will give us drugs or a cheap pep-talk to keep us going? Sorry. I ramble sometimes. These are what I worry about constantly even though it's nonsense. Whenever my friends are down I want to hear them out. I want to help even though I can't help myself.\n\nReally, the biggest issues that hit me right now are my relationships. I do have plenty of people that I'd call friends but recently I've started to drift away from them. After drugs and alcohol came into our lives, I started to contemplate myself critically. Did I really need this in my life to be happy? Is this going to be the norm of our group for long? How do I quit this? Many other questions passed my mind like if I'm going to get caught doing something illegal, but those types of questions didn't bother me as much as the ones stated earlier. It seemed like every time I went out to a party, the only way to have fun was to get destroyed. At first, I liked it, it let me escape the stresses of life by finding a void. A void that made me feel light and weightless. A void where I lost myself. After a while, getting wasted became depressing. I reached the epiphany that this high/drunk version of me wasn't really me and shouldn't be my idea of \"fun.\" I mean, there was a time when my friends and I used to have fun. A time when we were still, at least, somewhat innocent. For example, before drugs came into our lives I remember going to the playground to play soccer and having LAN parties and playing board games. We used to be happy together...without this. Without substances, we used to have real talks like this one which actually grew our maturity and ways of understanding each other. I miss it and it'll probably never come back. That isn't to say, though, that everyone fell prone to these substances.\n\nMy best friend, P, stayed away from it all (him and a few others, but he's the key player in my life). He was the type you'd expect to be the stoner kid with his crazy hair, exuberant clothing, and hipster personality, but he kept on the straight and narrow. He never did anything wrong and his parents gave him plenty of opportunities in terms of freedom, so lying to them and going behind their backs to do something they believed wrong wasn't appealing to him. I was almost envious of his self-control. Almost every friend he had, including me, tried to get him to do it in varying degrees. His girlfriend, E, seemed to be the Queen of Pressure to him. She'd play this game with him to guess a number at the same and if they guessed the same number then he'd have to do said activity which usually involved hitting her vape (What Are the Odds). You could tell he hated it, but he never lost. I never understood them even to today, but that's a whole different can of worms. All of these snippets are a can of worms barely open. My Dad's transition from father figure to stoned \"bro\" living in the same place as me, Mom coercing me to live with her, Grandma being the Mother figure but rarely being around, having so many friends yet so disconnected when around them, never finding true love, being alone. Alone. That's not true. Plenty of people enjoy my presence and want to go out but I push them away. I go online to sob about my problems but they're self-inflicted. I did this. I want attention. That's why we post this right? We're looking for help that's, in reality, superficial instead of real. Authenticity is faint. It's something I wish I was throughout my daily life. This smile. This happiness. The life I want. I know it's real and there but why can't I feel it? I went on another tangent didn't I? Damn it.\n\nI know I've said this too many times but I apologize. If you've come this far I truly am grateful. I've been writing this for a span of a month in random intervals. Half an hour here, five-minute refinery there, and sometimes two hours of looking at it. I realize that these tangents I go off on most likely hinder my story in terms of cohesion, but nonetheless, they're still important. They're what comes to me in the moment. My true thoughts unfiltered. They're the voice that builds me up and destroys me in the same moment. They're me. Anyways, I've had an interesting time writing this. Though the snippets I've given are only scratching the surface layer. Maybe I'll write a more in-depth look at these short ideas in the future, but for now, I think I have to end it. Like I've said before, I enjoy helping others and when I think about what really helps me, it's this. My thoughts are digitally materialized for both myself and you to see now. Even though I'm not a fan of writing or analyzing literature, reading about other people's problems and writing about my own are the exemptions. I don't think I have the vocabulary to describe this but if I could put it into one word it'd be everything. Despair, depression, pathless, dubious, lonely, frustration, melancholy, happiness, pleasurable, innocent, cathartic. All of these words I'd use to describe this process of my look back on life. All of that, and hope. The one thing I think We can do to keep to stay alive is to hope life will get better. Hope that this kid can make it out. Hope that his Mom would stop using him as a social pawn. Hope that his Dad will come back to being a Dad. Hope that he's not crazy. Hope that this arrogant teenager's ramble won't just be another piece lost to the endless space of the internet but as something to truly help others. Hope that we'll find the dream job we've always wanted. Hope that our wounds will heal. Hope that a shred of our innocence comes back. Hope that when we fail we can get right back up again. Hope that we're not alone. Hope that we'll finally find love. Hope. That's all I can really say. I know it's cheap, it's clich\u00e9, but it's why I'm alive. It's the one thing I escape to when I'm alone and at my lowest point. It's the place that lets me imagine a brighter life. A life filled with romance and wonder. Hope is my void.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;", "subreddit": "lonely"}

{"post_id": "agfacg", "created_utc": 1547597967, "title": "Why I was discouraged from online dating", "author": "TrentonConnector", "self_text": "For a period of about two years, I had online dating accounts on Plenty of Fish and OkCupid. I was skeptical about online dating before this, but a few of my other early-20s friends who had never been in relationships tried it and quickly got into long-term relationships. So I decided to try too. I put a ton of time into building profiles, filling out questionnaires and doing compatibility tests. The first thing that seriously intimidated me was the match page. Just a cascade of pretty faces looking at you, with every woman making you think of all the potentials of what messaging them might lead to. After about a year of trying and failing to start conversations, I did finally manage to meet up with someone but right before the \"date\" she told me it wasn't romantic and had not to consider it a date because she wasn't really interested (before we'd even met). After that date we seemed to like each other as friends, but surprise, she ghosted me even after giving me her Skype. That was the only person I met as a result of online dating. \n\nI received an incredibly low amount of messages or replies while on either site. The infuriating thing is, every so often I'd get an email like \"you've gotten new messages on OkCupid!\" I'd excitedly drop what I was doing to check, only to see it was a message from OKC staff notifying me about an update in their terms of service. Either that, or it'd be a message from a bot.\n\nAs time went on, OkCupid was giving me fewer and fewer matches. It stagnated completely when I had the same 10 or 11 matches for months on end. I saw no new faces. Also, OkCupid progressively became more and more like Tinder, to the point that you now cannot even read a person's message without 'liking' them, which is just ass-backwards. You can check r/OkCupid around this time and it's full of people complaining about these changes. \n\nI switched my focus to Plenty-of-Fish, sent out a few messages, and promptly had my account deleted completely. The site doesn't even recognize my login anymore. I found out that POF automatically deletes accounts that have been blocked by 3 people. So it turns out that rather than simply ignoring my messages, women were actively BLOCKING me. You can imagine how I felt. I promise that my messages to them were completely polite and unassuming. Hours of building a profile, down the shitter. It's unbelievable. \n\nAll in all, my confidence fell during the time I tried online dating. I had no idea about how most men are utterly ignored or avoided on these platforms until after I tried it myself (I'm not saying that women don't have a tough time of it too, though). Looking at that cascade of pretty women in my matches made me feel more and more uncomfortable and unworthy, so I stopped trying.\n\nSo now what? Welp, I'm turning 25 on Saturday, and my hair is going white already. I'm starting to get wrinkles too. I have to get out of this, so I'm going to set up accounts on Bumble, Chemistry, even Tinder if I have to. Fuck it, if pretending to be a Christian is what it takes, I'll go on ChristianMingle and spam Bible quotes in my profile. Maybe this time will be different.\n\nSorry for the long post--I just wanted to share my experience somewhere. I'd be curious in hearing others experiences with online dating stuff.", "subreddit": "ForeverAlone"}

The photos don't take up most of the screen, half is dedicated to profile (and compatibility score) and half is focused on images. \n\nThe only other solutions I can possibly think of is limit the signups to something like 1 guy for every 1.5 girls and make it that girls can send a message even if they don't match, maybe these messages can go in a 2nd tier message folder, but it would help for guys to at least get a shot at talking to girls if they like them but the guy for whatever reason didn't swipe yes on their profile.\n\nWhat ideas do you have that could make OLD a far better experience?", "subreddit": "ForeverAlone"}

I also do 4 hours Tuesday and 6 Saturday at the internship \n\nI have talked to my friends about it. I have even told them how I honestly would rather have someone kill me instead (not suicide it doesn\u2019t solve my problems)  kinda like oh I died in a car crash thing where it\u2019s an unfortunate event. But since at the factory I set in  the office and do blueprint drawing on the computer they think I\u2019m just bored at work. Like waking up at 6:30 and not getting home until 10:30 is easy. \n\nLiterally everyone I have talked to about my situation (friends and parents really) all think I should just stick it out. It\u2019s honestly mentally draining me. I\u2019m normally an upbeat happy dude but seriously if I was forced to chose between death and life I would chose death right now just to end this hellish nightmare I got myself into\n\nThe way I see it is I have 3 options. \n\nOption 1: since I\u2019m going back for another 2 semesters. I quit the internship and do it next fall when I won\u2019t be working in the factory\n\nOption 2: take this semester off and take it next winter semester \n\nOption 3: suck it up and deal with these 76 days. The worse part is tho I don\u2019t mind the factory work. The fucking internship I hate.

Some of its not by choice but most of it is by choice. My circle of friends is small, and I'm usually off the grid a lot due to work. The loneliness really stems from a lack of a girlfriend. I wanna be clear, I am very mentally stout. Based on poor middle school and high school experiences, I decided you had to earn my trust. I'm very easy going, friendly, but pragmatism and mistrust of strangers means I'll usually stay shelled up. This mindset of making sure I don't get hurt/burned means i don't usually go out of my way to approach the girls I do find attractive. Moreover, I like getting to know someone before I decide to let her through the wall I've thrown up, so to speak. I realize that meeting people is a risk vs reward, because a good woman is truly something to treasure. And you have to take risks to find those people that make you say damn, i really do care about you. I guess i havent met all that many girls who do make me wanna open up.  and the ones i do get to know well usually and deservedly find boyfriends by the time I've made my mind up. Maybe this is how it's supposed to be for me. And, for the first time in my life, I'm starting to say I'm okay with that. People can say i should lower standards or whatever else the life coaches say. I definitely could be more decisive. But, I realized I don't want just ANYONE around. I want that person who's gonna make me want to get out of my shell because she cares about me, and i care about her. Its a give and take. And the fact I haven't met that person pisses me off because I know I could be more outgoing when it comes to girls but I chose not to be because I haven't found that person who I want to let inside. The anger builds because I berate myself for complaining about myself being the victim.\nI've realized that I have lived my life independent/alone and have come out stronger for it. I realize that right now, only one who's gonna be there for me is me. I realized the world is gonna keep turning round and round whether I wanna be on board or not. \nI define who I am. Not girls. Not my friends. Not anyone. It is my life. It's the only one I have, and I should be allowed to live it happy and free.  I don't have to settle.\n\nI know most of the people on this subreddit are sad as well, and I do not mean to diminish what they're saying. Their situations are their own and not mine to judge. I don't know what they went through, but I wish them all the best. I wanted to say this on the off chance there are others who may have been feeling what I do about being alone, and maybe have reached similar conclusions of their own, that life is meant to be lived, and when all is said and done we should have lived it like we enjoyed it.\n\nAt the end of the day, everyone, we are alive. If not for anyone's but your own, be free. Be happy:)", "subreddit": "lonely"}

If you are getting bullied, stand up for yourself. Thanks to u/Monday_FA_Monday for talking about this. I was watching one of his videos and I realized one of the main reasons I still have trouble standing up for myself is my experiences at home. When I was a kid, I was bullied almost every single day at school. People would tell me to stand up for myself. I couldn't bring myself to do it because in order to stand up for myself, I would need to use positive reinforcement I normally would get from my family to form the base of the confidence needed to stand up to bullies. The problem was, my biggest bully wasn't at school. It was my sister who bullied me more than any other kid that bullied me especially from middle to high school. My mom enabled her and I didn't have a father at home since he ran away when I was little. \n\nIt's a lot harder to stand up for yourself when you are already crushed at home. I don't blame my family for being FA but destroying my self-esteem didn't help me when I was a kid. Low self-esteem can snowball into problems like FA.

We would have talks about how we were going to create the best family possible, she could name the baby what ever she wanted and I would have chosen the middle name. I would start off by learning a trade welding/carpentry/ and my girlfriend would go to college to learn how to become a Teacher.\n\nWorking my trade until I was 34 I would have had enough money to put a deposit on a house for our new family. I would then propose to my wife with a signed deed to our new house and a nice emerald ring (green is a great color in my opinion). She would hopefully say yes and then we would plan our wedding, we would not go extreme with this but we would have an amazing day for sure.\n\nThe wedding day had came and our families and friends were all there, it would have been a real magical day indeed. We would get married and 2 months later would think about having a baby with her (But due to my pathetic disgusting genetics this would fail majorly) but anyway we would have the baby and raise it to be a good christian person, we would attend Church every Sunday morning the whole 3 of us and instead of my churchie friends being like \"Oh hey that's Caleb the weird guy\" they would smile and be like congratz.\n\nMy child would have now turned 5 and would be ready for school, but no I would not be sending my child into the devilish public education system at all. My wife (WHO I  WOULD LOVE SO DEARLY IF I HAD ONE) would home school him. I would treat my wife with love and care and compassion and my children would have a loving upbringing.\n\nwe would help our child get the best possible start to life that I could offer. But no you have abusive parents so much around it ain't funny, child abuse pisses me off big time, here I am a kind loving person who can't get something like a wife, but some punk ass fool can win the girl over easily and have a child with them can? But yet that doesn't make sense at all does it? Why does a child have to have a shit upbringing but someone like me who could give a kid a good upbring can't even find a wife? Well I guess I don't know what to say!\n\nBut due to my foul genetics and poor social skills I can't make any of this happen at all, I am not even ugly at all.

I think he could tell I was embarrassed by the look on my face. Ron started working there about 5 months ago, with no managerial experience. He gained admiration from the owner of the company, and was offered a managerial position probably about a week ago. I asked another manager, Jennifer, if she had any experience being manager before this and she said no. She has been working there for about a year. I feel like the owner just puts anyone as manager. I used to really like Ron despite the fact that he has a girlfriend. I never hit on him or anything and he never really hit on me. But he shows deep interest in Jennifer. It's obvious he likes her and the other manager, Josh, seems to have feelings for Ron or I may just be reading a little bit too much into that. But one time Ron took off his hoodie and as he was doing that, Josh was like \"YESSS!\" Josh is always kissing Ron's butt and always tries to be by him and joke around with him.

Ron mouthed something and Josh said \"You don't say.\" I looked up at Josh and he was looking at me like Ron was talking about me.

{"post_id": "ah9pp8", "created_utc": 1547812477, "title": "Nightly account #6.", "author": "fastzander", "self_text": "  \n\nIn this post: [https://www.reddit.com/r/ForeverAlone/comments/a9mp6k/thinking\\_about\\_going\\_out\\_and\\_approaching\\_one/](https://www.reddit.com/r/ForeverAlone/comments/a9mp6k/thinking_about_going_out_and_approaching_one/), I contemplated the possibility of going out every night for a month and approaching at least one woman each time, and posting a nightly account on this sub. In this post: [https://www.reddit.com/r/ForeverAlone/comments/ab5n1z/welp\\_im\\_gonna\\_do\\_it/](https://www.reddit.com/r/ForeverAlone/comments/ab5n1z/welp_im_gonna_do_it/), I committed to said exercise, in addition to outlining some parameters. Because few bars are open, and few people attend bars, on weekdays, however, I have since amended the exercise; now aiming to speak to three women on Fridays, three on Saturdays and three on Sundays, for the four weekends of January, for a total of 36. The following post comprises my sixth such account, my account of the night of 18/01/2019.\n\nToday was pretty unillustrious, alas. In the morning, before I went to the bar, I received my first match on Tinder after weeks of just indiscriminately swiping right on everyone without even looking at their photos or bios (I\u2019d leave that for after I even got a match in the first place). I did just this exactly this, decided that she checked out, said: \u201chey\u201d to her, received a: \u201chey\u201d back from her, told her that I thought the dog in her photographs was cute and asked her what it was named\u2026 and then promptly never heard from her again without explanation. This is basically what my experience on Tinder has always boiled down to. I match with someone maybe once a month, I message them first because their profiles always tell people to message them first, I say and/or ask something innocuous to try and get a conversation going\u2026 and then they just disappear for no reason I can discern. If anyone can identify some glaring mistake I made somewhere down the line, then by all means, enlighten me.\n\nI did no better at the bar that evening. The weather was scorching hot, the music was being played at full blast, and the bar was absolutely packed, which only contributed to the heat in the form of body heat and the noise in the form of chatter. I did speak to *one* woman (briefly, as it turned out she had a boyfriend), but within about half an hour, I was sweaty, had a headache, and my resolve had melted away like butter. Me and a guy I had befriended left to get some fresh air, went to liquor store so he could buy a bottle of vodka which he shared with me, and then, since it was still pretty early, I forced myself to go back and try again. But I needn\u2019t have bothered. By now, the Meetup has disappeared and been replaced with a large group of Chinese birthday partiers of which not one could speak English. Realizing I was through for the night, I went home.\n\nHey, look, I\u2019m trying my best here. At least I went back a second time instead of just going home immediately after leaving the first time. And I\u2019m not giving up. I\u2019m gonna keep chipping away until I\u2019ve hit number 36, no matter how long it takes.\n\nIn other news, I\u2019ve decided to give a speed dating service a wing. I have no idea what such services are like; and whether I\u2019ll have any more luck here than on Tinder and OKCupid, I am pretty dubious. But I do like the idea of meeting in-person with women in circumstances where the explicit aim is for the participants to find romantic prospects. This doesn\u2019t start until February, however.\n\n**Tally:**\n\nGoal: 36.\n\nPoints: 11.\n\nBrownie points: 4.\n\nRejections: 0.\n\nPhone numbers: 1.\n\nAgain; ***polite***, ***constructive***, ***good faith*** suggestions are appreciated.", "subreddit": "ForeverAlone"}

(coming soon in Kindle format cause it's long af)", "author": "benmale1", "self_text": "Over the past several years I feel like I have bared witness to all whom I considered close and important in some way, leaving. \n\nAnd not going anywhere either, just leaving. There are some obvious exceptions to this rule. Primarily my decision to quit doing drugs after very nearly dying on a bus at 10am on a fucking Monday morning. Having escaped from a previously highly abusive relationship and becoming temporarily estranged from my newborn child (all sorted now btw, she's asleep upstairs, truly the light of my life), I felt like I had no other options. My friends and my work, performing music in bars across town at the time, revolved around them. This was around three years ago now and is a whole other story, so I'll cut it here but basically - clean for 3 years and I quite obviously don't see any of them anymore. \n\nFine, good. Lovely. Healthy. \n\nBut more recently, I don't know. I find myself sitting in the same bar I used to gig in all the time, drinking the same drinks, listening to the same music and having the same conversations. Smoking the same cigarettes in the same little shelter wearing the same shoes and the same jeans with the same coat and the same uncut messy tangled hair and suddenly I look around and realise that not a single person remains from the nearly 4 years ago I started drinking here on a regular basis. All gone, every single one, with exception to a couple of musicians who I know from when I played frequently and perhaps five members of the bar staff. \n\nPeople whom I considered my friends. People who I was close to and shared my time with. People who I was always there for whenever they needed anything, my ears were always open and my mouth was always closed. People trusted me and I was always honoured that they did and happy to help them in any way I could. I'd put myself out, constantly for all of them. All suddenly absent. \n\nSlowly people moved on, changed jobs / moved away, across the channel in a few cases and into the rest of Europe. I've had a friend die from an overdose and others come close. Some just completely took off and others moved on with their lives. And I look back on those days and I think about them all with love in my heart and then I'm desperately trying to recall who picked up the phone when I called. Who talked to me when I needed them? Who made sure I was okay? None of them. Not one. \n\nThere's one exception, I have one friend who I have known since college and though we never so much as shake hands, we're like brothers. You know those people who you feel are going to be in your life until one of you dies? Yeah, that's him. \n\nAnyway, all this time I'm recovering from the abuse. From the previous relationship and from a further trauma before that. I deleted Facebook, which accelerated the entire thing. Fucking hell it was like I'd just vanished off the face of the planet. It feels as if I've been sat at my usual spot in town, drinking coffee and watching the world go by - you know those moments in films when the subject is in focus and moving at normal speed and everyone around is all blurry and moving really fast? Feels like that - and gradually it's all fallen silent. The cigarette has gone out and the coffee has gone cold and I'm just kinda sat there, frozen. \n\nI have become this sort of invisible man. People know me when they see me and performing music in my city I do get recognised, but nobody stops to say hello. Nobody knows who I am or what I am like. And not in a narcissistic way, just in the way that you know what your friends are like. The obvious exception here being my college friend I was talking about, but he's just moved out of town and is now working a full time job, so we hardly keep in touch. We do when we can though, had a beer last night actually which was nice. But I cannot escape this feeling of loneliness. Of needing real affection. Conversation and coffee. \n\nA few weeks ago I finally cracked the wall I'd built. I let someone in. I say I let them in she kinda took a sledgehammer to the entire thing over a kitchen radio and a cup of tea. It was a while ago now, seeing each-other for around 6 weeks. I was terrified. Especially for the first two weeks, hell I wasn't quite sure what was going on. Just panic from my previous relationship 3 years prior, but full of determination to make it work. Beautiful, in every way. Truly she's gorgeous. I spent half my time thinking \"Is this really happening?\", and then with a certain inevitability, it stopped happening. She said she needed some time to herself having only recently broken up with her long term boyfriend. I was devastated, but accepting and understanding and didn't push for ay other outcome after our final talk over coffee. \n\nTwo weeks later she's plastering her new man all over Instagram. More money than me, better looking, the usual story... The wall is back up now and I am where I was before hand. Think I prefer this to the pain and anger I had a few weeks ago, and had indeed been trying to cope with 3 years ago when I found myself utterly broken. \n\nI think this final event has kinda sealed the deal for me. I'm done. Everyone has gone, except one and I am fine with that. I have my daughter back and I have my best friend, my immediate family and of course endless subreddits to enjoy. You lot seem to be more human than the people I meet in real life. \n\nI've found for all the love I gave out, I never really got anything back other than abuse. Being used. Leant on and then dropped. Etc... I never expected anything back. You don't give to get, but I thought maybe giving good brings you good. \n\nI'm gonna wrap this up cause I've just realised how terribly long this post is. But to conclude; it feels like this past year has been like watching the credits at the end of the film. Flashbacks of all the moments you loved but nothing in front of you but a list of names, all in black and white and all scrolling past you and up into the abyss. \n\nIf there is anyone out there who gets it, who is more comfortable being alone and for the most part enjoys it, know that you're not alone. \n\nExcept we are cause we like it that way. \n\nIt's an odd paradox I know but it kinda works. \n\nNight all.

I've been with my boyfriend for almost 4 years, have been through a few jobs, and adopted 2 dogs in this time. I've had terrible managers in 3 of the 4 jobs I've had, so I decided to try and start a business a year ago, but found myself even more lonely and more unhappy (currently looking for a job again). Outside of business interactions, I haven't made any personal friends. Every time I feel that I'm getting close to making a friend they start avoiding me, ditching on plans, and altogether ignoring me until I give up, which makes me feel like I'm being annoying and in turn makes me reach out less. I do not have family in the city, and do not have a close relationship with my family as is. So for 3 years the most interacting I've done personally has been with my boyfriend and my 2 dogs.\n\n I sit at home almost daily doing chores, or work on the computer, and hardly leave the house. My bf works 8-5 and comes home exhausted and falls asleep almost instantly, so even when he comes home, I'm still alone in a sense. I've noticed myself becoming more angry, more depressed, and not being able to handle my emotions as well as I used to, along with (basically) breakdowns every once in awhile.

There\u2019s a story behind that I think.\n\nAnyways that\u2019s not why I\u2019m posting on FA. I\u2019m posting on FA because I would like to vent a bit, as most people on this sub do. To set the exposition of this tale of a lonely human plagued by hopeful days and crushing weeks, I am 17 a dude and i recently moved to the burbs of Chicago from a small town in the Deep South. \n\nMind you I am not a redneck, I\u2019m brown, so I\u2019m pretty I can\u2019t be a redneck even I wanted to be one. Not that there\u2019s anything wrong being a redneck, just that I am not one despite being from a small town in the Deep South. I was born in Chicago if that helps, raised until the 2nd grade in Philly. So my roots are actually quite northern. \n\nAnyways back home (when I say home I do mean that gorgeous small town in the Deep South) I was yeno the kid who everyone knew about, for the sole fact that I was not a preppy white kid or a redneck. A rarity, one might say. And based on that pseudo popularity I was known for my general attentiveness in classes and funny moments I had during the day. So I was the kid that everyone knew but no one really knew knew. Once I got into Highschool I had a few friends i could say, but I never really hung out with any of em and this caused a bit of trouble for me. I thought something was wrong with me, up until my second semester in my sophomore year this is what my mindset was.\n\nI met a close friend in math class and throughout the next year I made a few more close friends. Still never went out with any of em, as I believe I was the friend that was thought of last, thought of at the end of the day when the fun was over and everyone went home and you laid in your bed and was like \u201chey I have a friend named voltaires_bitch\u201d and then did nothing else. No one really ever thought of contacting me or inviting me first, and yeno what I was kinda okay with it. I played video games and depression tends to make a human apathetic and lazy so I wasn\u2019t really in mood for a fun night out. I never have held this against my friends and never will.\n\nWhat hurts the most now that I have moved and have no friends anymore, is the harsh reality of my what life has became. Due to some long winded circumstances I graduated a year early and didn\u2019t really actually attended high school once I moved here. Due to this I haven\u2019t had an environment where I can meet people my age and form relationships. So now I spend most of my days staying up till 7 am and sleeping till 6-7 pm. I sit at my computer all day and then sleep. I rarely get texts from my old friends, as they have lives of their own and have jobs and friends and etc,  and the friends I made over the internet have lost interest. Once again I do not blame them one bit. Life seems bleak.\n\nIn an effort to yeno revitalize my life I agreed to take a vacation with my mother to India for a month. But I failed to realize that the climate here (I\u2019m a cold blooded human, 65 degrees F is too hot for me) is detrimental to my well being. So I am now spending my days sitting and reading and listening to music. This has tided me over for a week but I\u2019m slowly losing my grip. I also quickly realized that the tenuous relationships that I had, had started to deteriorate. The time difference has started to slow what little communication I had. As of now I haven\u2019t had a real convo with a friend in 3 days. I expect this number to grow.\n\nI see no reason for living anymore. My friends have forgotten me. I have no hope for making new friends. The few people I meet over the internet are dry and boring with monosyllabic responses as their primary form communication.\n\nlife sucks man.", "subreddit": "ForeverAlone"}

Maybe I\u2019m boring. At this point, I feel so demotivated that I\u2019m convinced that this simply isn\u2019t meant for me (I\u2019ve felt this way A LOT in the past as well). It\u2019s a fact (or \u201cfact\u201d) I cannot accept, but... what can I do?\n\nI don\u2019t know if my loneliness is returning, but I don\u2019t feel so well either. At this point, it\u2019s more like a feeling of unease. Sometimes it feels like I might end up crying soon, but I\u2019m not quite there yet. Since the summer of 2018, I\u2019ve been distracting myself by just doing stuff. I\u2019ve tried new things and joined clubs, and it\u2019s been great. This year I am traveling on my own. I also have a few other things I intend to sign up for to learn new (potentially) fun activists I can do. However, the relationships I\u2019ve forged with people through these activists seems a bit meaningless. It\u2019s fun, but it\u2019s not a real connection. I don\u2019t have anyone to go to the cinema or concerts with (I\u2019m doing both alone from now on). I don\u2019t have anyone to just hang out with. What I\u2019m getting at is... I fear I won\u2019t be able to distract myself much longer.", "subreddit": "lonely"}

I have noticed that many of you guys mentioned:\n\n1- I have a lack of motivation to live or wake up in the morning \n2- I play video games a lot\n3- I live with my parents, even though I\u2019m older than 22\n\nWell, I am FA too but I have managed to work around the above list of problems. What I found as a good coping mechanism was to make myself consumed with my work. It has many benefits:\n\n1- keeps you distracted from what you\u2019re suffering from\n2- helps you advance academically and financially \n3- gives you a tone of motivation to wake up every day in the morning \n4- helps you go to sleep normally \n5- makes your parents be proud of you instead of being disappointed\n\nI go to my office in the morning and stay at work until 8:30 pm, sometimes 10 pm. When I get back home I\u2019m like a dead body and go to bed at 10-10:30pm, and the cycle continues. I also work one day on the weekends too. People call me crazy and say I have no life. They don\u2019t understand that when you have no one in your life, living is a pain and I have no incentive to be at home. I hate being at home, except for sleeping.\n\nI also joined FA30+ subreddit, even though I\u2019m 25, because I was interested in learning what the FA life would look like in the long run. I read a post by a gentleman who was in his late 30s, had a successful career and lots of disposable income. He said that money doesn\u2019t bring him happiness but his job keeps him motivated. I related to what he said a lot and always imagine myself getting old that way. There are many people in the FA30+ subreddit who still live with their parents in their 30s and play video games and have poor financial status. You shouldn\u2019t let the fact that you are FA make you become a loser in all aspects of your life. I know this requires motivation and I am saying that dedicating yourself to work will give you the driving force that you need.\n\nGive it a try.\nCheers", "subreddit": "ForeverAlone"}

I literally just go to class, go to my internship, study, eat, and sleep. Nothing else. No new friends that I hang out with, a handful of restaurants that I eat at every so often (alone), and I'll walk around the city every so often just to kill free time by myself. I just don't know what to do at this point. I'm certainly an extroverted person, love making new friends, but I just haven't been able to click with anybody - they all have their friend groups and I don't feel a part of any of them - and I haven't found anyone, personality wise, that I click with. I feel like I can't make new friends anymore. Just feeling very isolated.", "subreddit": "lonely"}

More about this phenomenon can be learned on r/exjw. Basically, I am physically still attending meetings with a highly religious group but I do not believe in it. I attend because I'm a bit too young and broke to move out on my own and I go to college. This group also makes your family excommunicate or shun you if you leave the religion. You cannot do a litany of things but some include:\n\nBan on celebrating any holidays\n\nBan on celebrating birthdays\n\nBan on having friends outside the group. No school sports. No dances or prom.\n\nIn any case, growing up, I was nerdy and excelled academically but since I was generally a positive person, I never had trouble with girls. I wasn't allowed to date them and my social circle was stunted due to the religion. Even within the faith, my parents never introduced me and one of my siblings to other people our age but they did with my other sibling. I got the least favoritism as the oldest and the favoritism increased with a decrease in age. I stopped believing this religion over time and had female friends and male friends. I was on the cusp of having what I would consider a good life (great SAT scores, science clubs and still had sporty friends and flirted with girls who reciprocated). I thought I was doing fine until I crashed and burned.\n\nAfter a conversation with Monday FA Monday and watching his video on cars and ice cream, I realized that my crash, so to speak, coincided with a pivotal moment in my life. My mother told me that her love for me was conditional upon my adherence to this religion. I was about 16 at the time and I don't think I was the same from then on. I was noticeably more stressed and depressed and I never came back to my old personality, although I'm better than when I first heard her say that. My social circles were very sparse to begin with due to the religion and when college came, it's like I was dumped into an ocean with no lifeboat. I have made friends relatively easily but nothing as close as I'd like (I am an introvert and I only need a few friends but even then I feel stumped).  Groups of people I've met in school go places without me and I honestly never had a consistent group of people to hang out with. I do have one friend on the same page as me but he goes to school in another state. He would probably be considered FA too.\n\nDo any of you have any clue as to what I could do to come back from that? \n\nP.s.\n(don't know of this info helps)\n\nI have also experienced looks of disgust (woman stopped and gave me a middle finger once)\n\nOne or 2 people in high school hated me for no reason but most people thought I was ok\n\nI'm not hideous but I'm not a model either\n", "subreddit": "ForeverAlone"}

I really hoped I wouldn't come back this time, but here I am.\n\nI started to feel even more lonely than usual, so I tried tinder again. I used some photos when I was younger and frankly quite attractive, so some girls started to get matched with several girls.\n\nI wasn't expecting to actually meet any of those girls (this may be a little selfish but I accept it) I just wanted to speak with someone.\n\nAnyway, I got matched with a cute girl, not \"regular hot\" but more like \"geeky/intellectual hot\" and I gave her a super like, which it seems it even surprised her. We started talking, then we moved to whatsapp and discover we had a lot in common. I got really interested in her, she published a little poem book and she recorded an independent album. I find this extremely attractive in a girl. Also, we liked the same obscure bands that I didn't know anyone else in the city would even hear about.\n\nThings got better, we started talking romantically, sending us heart emoticons and talking about how we could collaborate in projects to create new music.\n\nEverything was awesome. Except that, if you read my the title of my post I already spoiled you the ending (sorry about that); one day she just stopped responding, she ignored me, ghosted me and as a last message I just said \"Could you at least tell me what did I do wrong?\"\n\nFinally that made her give me an answer; it seems I mentioned that I use some sleeping pills, and even though they make me sleepy I was really serious about continuing treatment. She said she doesn't trust psychiatrists and at first suggested me some new age bullshit (I was respectful about her advice, though. Obviously I didn't say it was bullshit) since I said I may look for some alternatives but continuing treatment was really important to me, she decided she didn't want a relationship that could turn up toxic (dafuq?).\n\nShe mentioned how she was a close witness of those kind of pills destroying people lives, and that she didn't want to go through that again. I tried some damage control, but she was pretty firm in leaving everything in \"friendship\".\n\nAs you may guess \"friendship\" is nothing but bullshit, I try talking to her after that not in a flirty way but in a friendly way, as she suggested, you know? I mentioned about the project we had talked about and she shut it off immediately, saying that actually she was very busy but that she wishes me all of the luck. After that I just stopped trying.\n\nIt's been a week and I just accepted the idea that this wasn't meant to be in the first place. I have to move on with my life.\n\n\\[Update!\\]\n\nSeveral days ago she messaged me. She apologized for not engaging in conversation during some days. She mentioned work and that she needed to sort things out (probably she at first thought she was done with me but changed her mind).\n\nShe invited me a coffee and two days ago and finally I met her personally. She's cute a we had a long chat. After the coffee she insisted in going on a another date. So we are having another one on monday.

As a guy, I am competing with other guys for women. Obviously women aren't prizes but that's how dating has always gone. Some women on dating sites have told me she would date multiple guys in a night. She wants to find the guy who has the most to offer. I'm not talking about just looks but overall. It's not shallow, it's natural to want that. People and therapists have told me it's not healthy to view dating as a competition. That's like saying it's not healthy to view The NBA as a competitive basketball league. \n\nAs a guy, I know the women I dated when I used dating sites weren't looking for the same types of guys. Each one had their own preferences in what they wanted in a guy. I'm not talking about FA women since I never dated any, but the average woman on a dating site. Maybe it's because they know I'm a loser and they think it will help to tell losers to not think about it as a competition because they will know the obvious which is, most people will find someone who they click with but some people are losers who just don't have anything to offer. Usually it's a combination of being below average looking to ugly, not financially secure which is important with dating, being independent so living with your parents is a huge negative, being short is also a huge negative which is something people won't admit but it's just a fact, and chemistry which can't be measured. Looks are obviously the most important thing but if you have things to make up for being short for example, the odds of you failing will be reduced. \n\nI'm not saying women are shallow and only looking for chad. Some women are looking for chad but some just want a guy who she knows is financially secure, independent, and they have chemistry that helps keep a relationship going past a one night stand or a friend with benefits. \n\nIf there are winners in dating, there have to be losers. The world isn't a preschool where everyone is a winner. Some people have to lose and some of us who did have the courage to try to date but failed are the losers of dating. People can't accept this and will use the just world fallacy to justify why we are losers.  ", "subreddit": "ForeverAlone"}

Both men and women don't really seem to like the app, but for different reasons, men find it extremely soul crushing and depressing, they become extremely self conscious and feel extremely unattractive, there are complaints that no matter what they do, they can't match with anyone or they constantly get ghosted and many guys I've talked to have said outright that the app has contributed to a severe deterioration in their mental health and self worth.\n\nWomen on the other hand find it depressing as well, but it seems mostly for the fact that they get tonnes of mens swiping on them and they realise most guys are boring, seedy jackasses, but another thing I've heard a lot from women is that \"it's a great app for when you get drunk and horny and want to make a questionable sexual choice for the night\".\n\nNow, for me, the experiences of one group I've spoken to are clearly, CLEARLY worse than the other. Yes Tinder is depressing for women, but lets be real, having a whole lot of shitty McDonalds with a Gourmet Burger here and there to choose from, is a far less depressing proposition than starving to death while watching others eat that McDonald's. \n\nSo why when I look up articles on Tinder in the media, why the fuck is it basically universally \"Oh woe what women have to deal with on Tinder, the dick pics! Why are men so awful *ignore that Tinder doesn't actually allow image sharing so the dick pic thing is really just a myth*\". Outside of a few medium and QZ posts, there seems to be no discussion really at all on how unfair these apps are largely to men and how they are really effecting men's self esteem and are leading to issues of inadequacy, depression and anxiety. Every guy I've spoken too, hundreds online, dozens and dozens IRL have extremely negative experiences with Tinder... so why is this ignored?\n\nWhenever I see men try to discuss this issue as well, they seem to get instantly attacked with #niceguys or #notallmen or #incel when it's frankly what seems like a pretty shared experience across at least straight cis men at least (I can't speak for gay men and their experiences with Grindr or Trans Men).\n\nWhile I think the Incel/Redpill community is a toxic black hole, frankly to me it's really no surprise many young men are flocking to it when they're largely the only visible group calling out what is pretty blatantly obvious to most guys when it comes to Online Dating at least.\n\nWill mens experiences with these apps ever get to become part of the mainstream discussion or will it remain as a taboo topic?

In this post: [https://www.reddit.com/r/ForeverAlone/comments/ab5n1z/welp\\_im\\_gonna\\_do\\_it/](https://www.reddit.com/r/ForeverAlone/comments/ab5n1z/welp_im_gonna_do_it/), I committed to said exercise, in addition to outlining some parameters. Because few bars are open, and few people attend bars, on weekdays, however, I have since amended the exercise; now aiming to speak to three women on Fridays, three on Saturdays and three on Sundays, for the four weekends of January, for a total of 36. The following post comprises my seventh such account, my account of the night of 20/01/2019.\n\nTonight I went to the same bowling alley that I did on last Sunday. Before the bowling itself, me and some of the other guys in the group played a bit of pool, and somehow, the organizer of the group scored a free game of laser tag, which I participated in as well. This was all a lot of fun.\n\nAs on Friday, I only spoke to one woman tonight. This is mainly on account of the fact that there were only four women there versus about twenty men, which made finding an opening hard. Nevertheless, I did speak, quite amiably, to one. At the end of the night, I asked her for her phone number\u2026 and she gave it to me! Between this and the fact that I actually enjoyed tonight, I consider tonight to be marginally more successful than Friday.\n\nTwo shower thoughts. Firstly, the fact that I managed to speak to six women on my first night appears to have been an instance of beginner\u2019s luck. It\u2019ll probably take longer to reach 36 than I thought. Nevertheless, having gotten my second phone number out of this exercise has given me renewed impetus to keep drilling away at it. (This time, though, I\u2019m not gonna try actually contacting her until at least next Friday). Secondly, whilst 16 women, in retrospect, isn\u2019t actually all that many, I will nevertheless say that none, thus far, have been cold or rude or unfriendly. On the contrary, all have been friendly and all too willing to chat. None have appeared disgruntled by virtue of me having approached them. I am dubious as to what extent the archetype of the ice queen who lives to shoot men down exists in real life. Now that I\u2019ve thought about it, I actually suspect that quite few women \u2013 and indeed, quite few people per se \u2013 are like that. And those that are like that probably wouldn\u2019t go to a bar in the first place, as opposed to drinking in solitude at home. Bars, after all, are fundamentally venues for socialization only slightly less than they\u2019re fundamentally venues for alcohol consumption \u2013 it\u2019d be disingenuous to attend one if one didn\u2019t, at the very least, desire to be in the presence of other people.\n\n**Tally:**\n\nGoal: 36.\n\nPoints: 12.\n\nBrownie points: 4.\n\nRejections: 0.\n\nPhone numbers: 2.\n\nAgain; ***polite***, ***constructive***, ***good faith*** suggestions are appreciated.", "subreddit": "ForeverAlone"}

Like  a high pitched voice that sounds like a girl even though I'm genetically male. Assymetrical face and weird head shape and jawline yadda yadda. I got locked out of my credit card for the fifth time in less than four months and each time I have to PHYSICALLY go to the bank because my voice is so fucked up that they cant verify my identity over the phone. It doesnt match my gender or age LMAO\n\n\n I have no friends and I pretty much sit at home and watch anime all day. But I decided that even if I'm gonna be friendless and and shit unlike normal people that I'd at least accomplish something in my life. So last semester I upgraded 2 high school courses, studied 5 hours a day in each class and guess what I applied to college with a 4.0 GPA, and got accepted to a very competitive program (nursing)! I'm already 20 most of my classmates got into college at 17, but  hey I'm not complaining at least I got there. . . But honestly I worked really hard so if I pass everything and graduate I can make 80k a year or more, perhaps even 100k because it's a high paying profession in canada. And I'm actually happy for the future because even though I'm alone I can spend all that money on whatever I want for myself, maybe even plastic surgery if I feel like it. I mean my situation is really shitty, I dont even think my chromosomes are arranged properly due to the issues mentioned above, but AT LEAST ILL HAVE MONEY\n\nAnyways just letting people know that even if your life is shit, like mine. There is still a way to be happy. You can go to college and make money and buy shit for yourself, maybe get a hobby that you can do solo. I like anime alot, I talk about it, watch it, read manga, and these sorts of online communities can be fun.\n\n\n And If you are the type that believes your lifes misery is as a result of your looks and you want to get surgeries you can do so if you go to college first. After deliberating it for many years I dont even want to change my face structure with surgery anymore despite the most intense dissatisfaction with my face because I know I'll just feel a whole new type of emptiness once I gain friends and realize they only like me because my facial features are arranged in a more pleasing way. At this point the whole concept of making friends and relationships just feels like it would make me feel like crap unless it's with my current set of genetics. I'm sure some people would feel happy to have friends at the cost of rearranging their whole faces but that would just make me want to not have friends at all. Anyways good luck, let me know what kind of ways YOU cope with your loneliness. Maybe I'm just avoiding the issue by drowning myself in secular pursuits, who knows!!", "subreddit": "ForeverAlone"}

They spoke to him the entire time and the woman said something like \"we'll stick to this table thanks, no matter how cute you are\" to my friend while hardly acknowledging my presence.

Prior to being selfish, I would imagine what could I do for other people, how I can help them, so on. Nowadays, it is all about what can THEY do for ME. I look at it as experiences, what experience can I get out of you? A work out of sorts, introductions to new people, exposure to a new location? On and on.\nIf a friend or stranger is asking for help, I make sure to get what I want first. This way, you are not screwed over in the end by them backing out. If people call you an asshole, so be it, at least you will be an honest and DEPENDABLE asshole that everyone knows will do the job once they are paid.\nIf a particular group or person does not to pay up first, I move on. Everyone can be replaced.\n\n2. Apathy, I found has helped greatly with paying compliments. Before, I would pay a genuine compliment with the hopes of having a conversation or getting number. Nowadays, being so busy with work, school, and family, I do not have the time or inclination for conversation. My compliments are short and \"matter-of-fact\". Usually, I am in a rush so there is a no smile from me or even eye contact. I am already on my way before they even say thank you.\nIt has gone from wanting to know the person to \"I do not care about you, but, your shoes do look nice.\" I do not compliment on looks, except if they have their hair braid in a really cool way. \nWhen it has lead to a conversation, it is about the actual object. It was easy because they did not have to worry about me hitting on them. I did not care about that, I just wanted to get something from them. \nPlus, it really does throw people off when they are given a fast, sterile compliment. They really never see it coming.\n\nPeople want what they cannot have, this is not a new phenomenon. When they discover they do not have a boot licker like the rest of the phonies, they will change around you. If they disappear on you, it is probably because they KNOW they will not be worshipped and very likely, challenged.\n\nIf this helps with anyone, share it! ", "subreddit": "ForeverAlone"}

That's why I decided to share my second successful life decision with you guys.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nGoing through a tone of your posts and comments here as well as r/FA30plus, I have come to the conclusion that many people still live with their parents, despite being their mid 20s and even older and I find it very detrimental as far as FA is concerned. Here is my successful personal experience:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI grew up in a super conservative household. My father was very overprotective of me to the point that he didn't let me hang out with the few friends that I had after 6 pm. My mother pampered me to an extent that I had zero social skills. I decided to move out of their house when I turned 22 and graduated from college. My parent obviously disagreed with my decision but I was adamant to do this because I had managed to find a job. I got some money from my father as an start-up fund and then rented my own apartment some place far away from my hometown. I lost all my friends besides my family as a result of this bold move. Soon I realized that I have to pay my own bills, buy my own grocery, cook my own meal, drive myself around and live like a responsible, independent adult because I was on MY OWN. Now after 3 years, I've got enough money to pay my dad back but he turned down my offer. God, it felt good when I told him he can count on me whenever he needs money. My parents see me as a grown-up adult now not their loser kid who needed their constant care.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf you are in your 20s and still living with your parents, I strongly advise you to move out because:\n\n1- it will help you become financially and emotionally independent\n\n2- You will start to act responsibly and it will help you stop screwing around all day, playing video games, watching stupid anime while you are 27! I know you guys adopt these habits as a coping mechanism but they are damaging and have to stop.\n\n3- Women tend to form a stronger, more mature opinion of you. They will see a grown-up, independent man who has got life figured out. Someone they can rely on and build a life with not just some horny teenager who lives with his parents and is desperate for a hookup. Trust me women are into this shit.\n\n4- You get your own place and your own car. You can bring girls home instead of sneaking them into your parents' house. You'll be able to buy them stuff that they like.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMoving out was the best decision I ever made in my life. If you are reading this post and you are well past 25, please take action as soon as possible because the later you move out the harder it will be to adjust.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nCheers\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEDIT: I got some negative feedback again. Let's consider my advice as just a wake-up call for those who are reluctant to move out and it's getting late for them, assuming that this won't help your FA situation. Please Get Your SHIT Together. \n\n&amp;#x200B;", "subreddit": "ForeverAlone"}

I know it is long, but this is the smallest I could make 4 years worth of information without leaving out crucial parts.\n\nI'm currently a 19y/o male in my second year of college who deals with off and on depression and anxiety. These feelings typically don't surface until I'm either reminded of, or meet with a certain person of interest. For simplicity sake, I'll call her \"Monika\" (fake name). Typically my life goes on with me studying at a trade school where the majority of my peers are male (there's literally 2 girls in all my classes), so I don't feel like I'm missing out on a S.O. because in a way, I kind of forget there is another gender. Anyway, I met Monika back in 10th grade when she was in 9th grade. We saw each other everyday in band as we both played trumpet. I would hang out with her at the school football games and she typically was only ever talking to me, Sayori (another fake name of a girl I'll get to), or her best friend who played flute. As the years went on, we grew very close, I eventually told both Monika and Sayori about my depression, which at the time was really bad. At this time I only wanted death. I was subjected to mental torture everyday for months as I began to hear 24 different voices in my head. When I told Monika about this, she looked at me and said, \"Dallas, you need Jesus\". At the time I hadn't a clue about religion, as a lived a very sheltered life and didn't even know what a church was until I was in the 7th grade. I had no other options, so I decided to go along with it. Over the next couple of weeks, I tried reading parts of the Bible, but that wasn't helping. Eventually one of the voices told me that on the last day of school (a Wednesday in June when it was currently around March) something bad would happen, and whatever it was would be all resolved by the Friday of that week. In May of that year, the voices disappeared and I haven't heard them since. On the last day of school my Grandpa on my mom's side of the family slipped unpredictably into a coma, and the next day he passed away. This is the family member I took after the most, both in appearance and personality, so it was tough knowing that I knew ahead of time this would happen but there was nothing I could do. Over the summer of that Junior-going-into-Senior year, I knew I had to do three things. #1, get my license, #2 fix my depression, #3 get a job. I needed to get my license because I was going to my school's Vo-tech/CTC class, and I would have to drive an hour to and from that place everyday to be able to still see Monika and Sayori everyday. I got the license and did just that, for them. Now I'll tell you about Sayori, she was the dumb one of the the three of us. She was blonde/naive and always falling for the worst people. I had to help her out through a majority of this, this caused us to be a little more closer than myself and Monika. As for the depression part of my summer, I volunteered at my local church's vacation bible school program and got a little bit better. I also got a job working a local department store owned by Mennonite people who mainly only hired conservative people. Me working here furthered my religious beliefs even more, they even helped me later down the line with this girl, Yuri. \n\nSenior year came and everyday I drove 2 hours just to see Monika and Sayori for 45ish minutes a day. This year I met a new person in band, I'll call her \"Yuri\". Yuri was a sophomore flag girl who rapidly became interested in me for God knows why. Being extremely passive at this point in my life, I just went along with it and ended up in a 4 month long relationship. When I told Monika and Sayori about Yuri, Sayori was happy for me, but Monika was kinda pissed at me - she never did say why though. Anyway, the first 3 months with Yuri were great, but the 4th month, we both began challenging each other's morals. I also had this thing I did on Instagram where I would post a daily meme, as a reminder of my days of depression. I posted the memes daily so that way no matter how dark someone's day was, they had a daily source of light and weren't in total darkness like myself. Yuri made me stop posting these daily memes. After our second argument in the 4th month, she went out of the country on vacation. While she was out of the country, she accidentally sent me a Snapchat with the words \"Plus, I wouldn't break up with him while I'm down here\". I got that text on Friday, and she came back into the country on Monday. between those days we didn't say much to each other, but we ended up breaking up that Monday. The breakup was supported by my co-workers as they told me that love doesn't make people question their morals. Coming out of this relationship, I realized that my morals seem to be extinct in this day and age. The biggest one being that no matter what, after I marry someone, if they were to die, I wouldn't re-marry, as I believe that you should only marry once. Now that it was February, I had been out of band for a month now. My parents didn't want me to continue in the second semester as it didn't include marching band, and the gas prices weren't worth it. In March, I got a text from Sayori, she had asked me and Monika if we'd like to catch up at the local coffee shop after school one day, as Monika also quit band during the second semester. I agreed to join them for some nasty coffee after school. When we met up, we talked fairly long, I told them about how Yuri and I broke up, about my old-fashioned morals being the main cause for it. I asked Monika what she thought of my morals, and she said that she probably would feel the same had it not been for the Hallmark movies she's seen, which is honestly the closest to my own viewpoint I've gotten out of someone my age. I also invited Monika to see me get Baptized on April 9th, 2017 - as she was the one who kinda introduced me to Christianity. She came to it and was very happy for me. When I got baptized I also found out that the church I just became a member at, and got baptized at our family has been going to it for the past 4 generations including myself and my Grandpa. A few weeks go by, and Sayori asks to meet up at the coffee place again, but this time she bails a few hours ahead of time. To my surprise, Monika still wanted to go, we met up and played Phase 12 after she taught me how to play, and we had a great time. She also told me about how she felt empowered recently as she rejected one of the cutest guys in her grade. I would have tried to pursue her there, but I felt a bit of regret coming from her as she told me this. I ended up graduating and nothing else happened between us besides the occasional coffee shop meet-up every few months, until August of 2018. \n\nDuring this time, Sayori proposed we go to Panera Bread instead of the coffee shop. I agree and we go this time, we have a good time and somehow end up on the topic of Sayori's and Monika's future weddings. Before I continue, you should know that Monika is like 50% country girl, and I'd rate myself around 10-25% country. So they suddenly turn the conversation to my wedding. I laugh it off with a \"like that'll ever happen\". Both Sayori and Monika simultaneously ask me if they could be my flower girls. My gut sank, but before the silence overcame us, I said \"you can't be the flower girl if you're already the bride\". They both immediately let out one of those weird eeeks girls do when they're excited. I felt a little better as I had prevented myself from renewing my friendzone card. I say renewing, because back in my Junior year, I forgot to mention, both Monika and Sayori friendzoned me. Monika told me that it was ok for me though, that she does that almost all her nice guy friends, because she didn't want a relationship at that point. She also told me that she might take me out if we kept in touch some time after high school. Anyway, after saving myself, we got on the topic of what our standards for in a S.O. were. I said, she needs to be Christian, Conservative/Libertarian like myself, and know/would be down to learn a second language of German, Russian, or Spanish. Both girls I knew already knew Spanish because I was in Monika's class my Junior year, and I helped Sayori with her homework. Sayori stayed quiet when I said my thing, but Monika said she knows German too, as she knows some Dutch from being friends with Amish people in our area.  Monika then decided to go next and say her standards which included, being Christian - she then looked me right in the eyes and did an eyebrow raise kind of thing - Tall - looked at my 6'2 ass again and did the eyebrow thing -, be a little bit country, and can dance. She then looks at me and asks if I can dance. I say kinda, because I can contort my body in weird positions to the beat of music, but it usually doesn't look good. Then comes the part that I regret from this meetup. Her sister and sister's friend show up to pick her up to go line dancing (I guess that's a normal thing to do around here, like I said 10-25% country, the rest is computer tech). She asked if we wanted to go, and I said I probably shouldn't as I was wearing Adidas sneakers and I don't know if I could line dance in them. \\~STUPID ME\\~. The next day I get a text from Monika, Sayori, and myself's group chat from Monika about this guy she met last night. This brought my depression back hard for the next month.\n\nA few weeks after the visit to Panera Bread, myself, Monika, and Sayori's best friend (I'll call her Natsuki since she's short) all go to Sayori's house because she's going to be moving 3 hours away for college. We meet up and have a fun time, there was a point where I taught them how to read the Russian alphabet as I had been learning it recently. Monika also told me about how she was going to be going to Guatemala soon to better her Spanish with her cousin for a couple of months. Eventually, we came the part where we were going to give Sayori gifts. Monika and I left the party room (Sayori's garage) and went into the kitchen where she suddenly turned ravenous telling me about how her recent diet has been killing her. She scavenged through the kitchen looking for candy. I offered her for me to be her sugar plug and where she seemed excited at first she eventually declined. I got Monika to sign the makeshift card we made for Sayori out of a brochure for our county's attractions and took the present out to Sayori. We eventually all went home and Sayori went to college. \n\nDuring the fall semester of 2018, I didn't hear much from either of girls other than Sayori when she told me about her failed attempts at finding a boyfriend at college. I told Natsuki about this as Sayori has a historical record of leaving Natsuki out of this kind of stuff. After the semester ends, Sayori suggests that we meet up again. My closest guy friend, (I'll call him Jerry) saw this text and wanted to come too. I warned him that Sayori would be there, as they had a strange past, but he didn't care. So Sayori, Myself, Jerry, and Monika all met up at the same old coffee shop and talked. Jerry finally got to see how I acted around girls I'm somewhat comfortable with - and it was bad this time. I told Sayori and Monika about how I love my class this year because there's only one girl in the whole class, so I don't get anxiety like I normally do around girls. Other than that foul-up the only other detail to be mentioned would be that she re-told me about going to Guatemala for a few months. I also had found out that Natsuki had gotten engaged, even though she is a year younger than me. (more fuel to the I'll die alone fire) That day, Jerry told me he understood why I'm still chasing after Monika, because she actually makes me laugh.\n\nSince our last engagement last month, Monika has been living in Guatemala for at least two weeks. She also begged me to start back up my meme of the day for the 3rd time, I finally caved and decided to do it for her. Two days ago she posted on Instagram saying about how she wants to permanently move down there. This would suck because I pretty much already have an acre of land coming my way when I want it here in the states near my family. I've been feeling increasing depressed the past few days and I believe this is why. I don't want to straight up just tell her because while I haven't heard anything else about the guy from the line dancing night, I don't know what she wants relationship-wise and she HAS friendzoned me before, even though that was almost 4 years ago now. If you've actually made it this far and read all this, I applaud you, and I thank you for any thoughts you post on my love-waiting game.", "subreddit": "ForeverAlone"}

You couldn't talk to them very well.  Words didn't seem to work.   \nThey lied when they came out of your mouth. \n\nYou tried so hard to understand them.  You wanted to be part of what was happening.  You saw them having fun.  And it seemed like such a mystery.   \nAlmost magic.\n\nMade you think that there was something wrong with you.  You'd look in the mirror and try to find it.  You thought that you were ugly. And that everyone was looking at you.\n\nSo you learned to be invisible, to look down, to avoid conversation. \n\nThe hours, days, weekends,...ah, the weekend nights alone.  Where were you? In the basement, the attic, your room?  \nWorking some job - just to have something to do.  Just to have a place to put yourself, to have a way to get away from them.  A chance to get away from the ones that made you feel so strange and ill at ease inside yourself. \n\n\nDid you ever get invited to one of their parties?\n\n  \nYou sat and wondered if you would go or not, for hours you imagined the scenarios that might transpire.

It makes me disappointed as a male FA seeing others trying to excluding them when they need support too. I've talked to some women FA and they all seem like really nice people and I realized that we both share similar problems. While the gatekeeping isn't as bad as it use to be it's still a problem. \n\nIt might have driven very good and nice people away who could of really needed the support. I'm not trying to blame anyone specifically cause I met a lot of great people on here and Ik they wouldn't do any of this. However it sucks to lose out on members cause some people don't believe they belong here. It's a different story if they were spouting normie advice and getting nasty with us when we disagree or been in a lot of relationships before.

Live together with parents to decrease costs of living for whole family, it's not cheap to live in Latvia with our minimum wages. I work at home which is awesome(don't have to deal with stupidity of many people that I see via internet these days). So many positive perks come with that. Both personal and if in relationship, always at home etc.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo there was this girl in Russia, we connected via social media. shy, introverted, lewd, into games, anime, writing fiction. Pretty similar to me, so it easy for us to like each other. Later I found out that she had a crush on me for a few years now and was surprised I initiated with her. Later we did together a lot of things, including lewd ones via voice chat. After several months, she couldn't wait any longer and decided to fly over to Latvia and book a flat near my home for easier access. She wanted to explore the Riga and our nature that our contry is famous for, but primary reason was obviously me. We were planning ahead of time what we will do each day during her vacation, and where to go. Both of us were pretty hyped also because we were both virgins. I obviously given my life position have almost 0% chance of meeting somebody IRL in our country for many other reasons I posted in FAD subreddit if anyone cares, so I always hoping of forging something via internet.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nJust before her flight to me, she announced to me that her \"heat\" is gone and doesn't want to do anything with me, just be friends if I still wanted, and apologized for wasting my time. She said it's okay if you just dump me and not even meet me/escort/hang out during vacation. I am not a jerk so I couldn't just do that and still did everything a proper man would do when you meet a girl from other country. I still wanted to be her friend because we have so much in common and it was always fun for me to interract with her. So on 1st day of her vacation we ended spending whole day in her flat, talking about ourselves in person now. She wanted to get rid of me, I could tell that by her actions/expressions even tho she did a good job playing along with me. On next days, I offered her help, assistance, hanging out more, escorting, anything really, she wouldn't care or reply. She said she is a big girl and can be alone. Sure, okay. I gave up at that point because who likes clingy man right? Well later I found that her sudden change of mood was based on her being a feminist and her female-friends cycle forced a negative stigma towards the fact that she was about do things with me. On top of that she have doesn't love herself, have depression/suicidal thoughts and you can imagine the rest.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAfter highschool years, when I pursued my career and locked myself out of society, most girls I met were via internet, and oh boy, in my personal experience there is a really high chance that any of them is going to have a mental conditions. And that shouldn't scare you. Because that's a reality for all of us, FA folks. Normal functinal people wouldn't be here or those who rely on internet in general. In my life, due to my community-related works, I learned to care a lot of other people and that goes to internet strangers as well. Life tossed at me several suicidal folks that I had opportunity to save, and I did, because I am stubborn and even if they toss me away, I still come back because I know that need that support since they have nobody. Unfortunately not everybody is the same and 1 person wasn't listening to the very end until it was too late(F to my dear friend Nina).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhat's the purpose of this post you might ask?

I have never had a girlfriend or ever kissed or held hands with a girl. I'm also a virgin. I'm pretty short (at most 5'6\"), but I have had girls approach me on more than one occasion. I've also had girls try and hug me and more. So I determined that I might not be so ugly. \n\nHowever, after girls get to know me, they kind of slink away. I say this because it's like I'm holding a piece of dry ice. It's solid then it evaporates once it's in my grasp (that is the relationship with the girl). One girl I know who I was good friends with and had a small crush on told me this in middle school: \" You would have a girlfriend by now if you focused less on school\".\n\nI puzzled over this but she may be correct. I was raised in a cult basically so school was one of the only things I was allowed to do. I also happened to be good at it. In recent times, one girl I knew asked me for notes in class (a huge lecture hall with hundreds of people. She passed my friend when she asked). She then introduced herself at another date, separate class. It almost seemed like she was waiting for me at the door. We walked and talked a bit but I figured she was being nice. At another time we talked on a train ride so we exchanged numbers and set up a study date. She brought her friends but it was primarily us talking. She seemed a bit annoyed by me in this study \"date\" as time passed bc I was actually helping her with the problems. I tried to downplay my knowledge by saying \"I could be wrong but I think it's actually this....\" or \"I got this, how about you?\" \n\nAnyway, after this, we never really met together again. I was sort of confused on this front. Not that myers briggs is reliable, but I'm an INTJ-A if that helps. I am very goal oriented and when I'm not intensely focused on school or my hobbies, I find that I'm too clingy. Girls only seem to be interested in me when I'm interested in doing some large project in my life (that requires time I can't devote to them). I am genuinely friendly but I get immersed easily in things I'm interested in. \n\nThe way I operate, I tend to resonate with some people and turn some people away. One group of people I knew started not hanging out with me amd leaving me out of things. I can't really tell why but I do know that it started after I couldn't attend a last minute event they told me about. Ever since then members of that group habe knowiny or unknowingly treated me as a black sheep (either studying without me, making groupchats without me, meeting and eating without me, or refusing to tell me where they're going or what they are talking about, cock blocking me at one point). I got the hint after a while so I just stopped trying to talk to them. Some of the people are nice but as a group, not so much. \n\nI found that as soon as I started hanging out with people who are smarter (by most people's standards), I faced less alienation. It's still there but it's more of a pleasant atmosphere where I'm unfamiliar with most people, not an outright rejection from those I've known for months. I don't mean to be elitist but has this been anyone else's experience?\n\n\nAnyway, I thought this would be a good subject to probe the subreddit on. ", "subreddit": "ForeverAlone"}

Virgin and never had a girlfriend, not even kissed a girl, and it's slowly killing me more and more.", "author": "notoriousmeekster", "self_text": " Hi everybody. Well like the title said, my anxiety and Asperger's syndrome, apart from severe bullying, never allowed me to have enough confidence to actually even approach someone. I feel like I missed out on all the fun people my age normally have, especially the late teen years. These past couple of years I tried doing everything I can to actually change my lifestyle and maybe gain more confidence. For context and starters, I'm an international student in the US in South Florida, coming from Spain. I wish nothing but a fucking nuke on that country after all the pain I went through there, with nobody, not even teachers, helping me, even with all the dog whistles of me failing every single class every semester and sitting alone at lunch or staying in the bathroom through out the entire break time. I saw a therapist there for almost two years, even formed a motherly bond with her, and we still chat over WhatsApp. But people forget that seeking help ain't fucking free, and this country's (the US) shitty and intimidating immigration system won't let me get a job until one year into being here. Been here for more than half a year now. You'd think this change of space of me finally changing countries and studying what I actually love may actually help me and my everything in my life would change. I'd meet new people, maybe have a good time, and maybe even luck with someone, the same luck I didn't have back in Spain. So far, in my almost 8 months here, only my fucking grades have changed. Nothing else. Apart from my class almost being a total sausage fest (not that I wouldn't be friends), lots of the people in my class have major red flags to them that discourages me from wanting to hang out with them outside of school. I've had Tinder for years and despite now for a while finally being able to get at least some matches, they're few and far between and when I actually get some they ghost on me after a while and stop responding. I don't what the fuck I'm doing wrong.\n\nWhich brings me to last month: I get a match with a girl around Thanksgiving and I actually sense some sort of connection, we had pretty much everything in common, even gave each other our numbers. Problem was she was only visiting her family for Thanksgiving and studies in Orlando, but nonetheless she agreed to meet up with me over the weekend before she left at least. At the last moment, she cancelled because apparently she had to leave a day earlier than expected (I'm pretty sure she was fucking lying, but whatever, I can get maybe she was insecure about meeting up with a stranger). However she said she would come back in a few weeks for Christmas and would text me. In the meantime we'd talk to each other for a while, but then she suddenly stopped talking to me, even after sending her some messages. I made a playful joke about her being dead and then she says \"I just don't feel like talking anymore, sorry.\" As expected for someone like me who missed out on a lot and eventually got desperate, I raged extremely hard and cried for almost the entire day. If only anybody here knew how painful it fucking is to seemingly have some hope with someone finally only for them to ghost on you at the last minute. I'm sorry if by saying all that I'm turning everyone else away. I wanna be better, but something beyond my control always fucking happens that makes me go back to square one.\n\nSo there you have it. This month I mustered up the balls to actually go to bars alone, despite having no one to hang out with, to see if I actually get lucky. I don't have the confidence to approach anyone, especially not women. I try getting drunk to wash away those fears, but I only end up being creepy, at least that's what I think. Eventually I start looking like the typical slobbish suicidal shitbag who's just drinking his problems away. I just want, for once in my fucking life, know what it's like to get a good morning text, to hang out and walk through the centres while arm hovering each other, to be hugged by a SO after having a bad day. Fucking something like that. Everyone else seems to have that luck, why can't I? What the fuck did I do to deserve so many personality flaws? I know there are some traits of mine that turns some people a way, but I'm doing the best I fucking can to go out there, change as a person, and nothing fucking works. Yes, I'm legit seeking help here. Yes, you can reply venting and saying you have the same problem, but what I would actually prefer is legit help, more than just advice. Just someone please fucking help me. I don't wanna be in isolation anymore but at the same time from what I see there's nothing for me out there anymore.", "subreddit": "ForeverAlone"}

Video games can help distract me, but I am talking about things that people are told to go out and do. They tell you that you will never be happy until you can be happy alone but the same things that 10 years ago you would go out and do to make you happy don't bring you happiness. I used to go to the city alone and walk around to find new places to eat or back then, new places to read books in. I went there multiple times a week for years to parks to relax in. I went to cafes that I've never been to because I wanted to try new drinks. I never went to bars because I would only take these trips during the day. I had to work in the evening or do something with my family that prevented me from going out alone. I tried bars close to me in walking distance. These trips made me happy because every time I walked around I would find a new place to eat, drink, sit in, or walk through. \n\nPart of me thought I would eventually meet someone but I didn't specifically go out with the intention of meeting people. It was something that brought me happiness. After years of doing it alone, it began to get boring. During The Spring there would be that first warm day where you could wear a t-shirt and shorts for the first time since the previous fall. If I could, I would go in town that day and go to a park. I would sit there looking around taking in the scenery even if it was in a city. Every time I would see couples sitting on the bench next to me, or laying down in the grass together. I was always alone. Eventually it started to become depressing always going to a park alone. I stopped going to parks because they didn't bring me the happiness they did before being alone became too much for me. The same happened to other places in town. Six months later I stopped going into town for that reason. I would only go if I was going somewhere for another reason or passing through to another place. What brought me happiness started to bring me depression.\n\nI'm never going to find happiness alone. If that means I will never find anyone because I can't learn to be happy alone, then it's something that I already have accepted. Have any of you tried to do things alone, found happiness but over time stopped doing it because they stopped bringing you happiness and in some cases they would cause you to become lonely or depressed?", "subreddit": "ForeverAlone"}

He had a condition in which he somehow believed he assassinated a political figure in my country and therefore wanted to kill himself for it. Again one moment I could recall is that of my mother asking to come with her literally begging me to come with her to a mental hospital but in my childishness I wanted to watch some mythical television serial. I can recall poverty in which we lived by the time and various instances my mother fended for our survival in society.\nNow cut to present I'm 27 year old man/boy now and still am dealing with same questions. My father well he's alright I guess after that incident he never fully recovered he was shadow of his former self. He never had the courage in life. Somehow we survived. My mother sort of played a role of both mother and father for me. \nIt went well for me in early childhood I was pretty good in academics but always faltered in physical activities despite my good physique. I found  team sports to be not my thing early on and couldn't connect well with the boys. I at the time thought myself to be intellectually better than my peers and I started reading pretty early on I was typical nerd.\nBut then something happened when I reached 18-19 I had taken admission in an engineering college and I was performing good enough in first year but somehow in second year I didn't want to pursue anything I was living away from my home at the time I started drinking,smoking I somehow fucked up my college life and career.\nI'm telling you all this to get you a perspective on what I'm going through right now, now I've cleaned up and came back to complete my college degree I had pretty big roadblocks on making my comeback but somehow I managed to get back.\nNow my current problem starts here I never  had a girlfriend in my life never had sex and never kissed a woman. I live in India. A girl in my class got attracted to me and we started chatting and texting alot she was interested in me and wanted to get intimate. But I hesitated. Problem was that she is married she had arranged marriage she didn't like her partner. On moral level I didn't agree with her I said it would be cheating but deep down I know my hesitation comes from perhaps not able to please her sexually. I liked attention I was getting but then she tried forcing me into it and we had quarrels over that.\nNow I tried to break up with her in order to save her from me,I gave her rude replies,short nos but this is killing me from inside. Now after that I've had arguments with friends I've become somewhat too sensitive and cranky. I am feeling lonely like never before and nobody is there to listen to me.

All of it, really. Even the choices you get later on. \n\nYour looks (of course) and how people respond; your aptitudes, and how it's valued in the market, financially and socially; your \"passions\" (God help if you have none, like me, or they're pathetic - if I'm honest, I am a dispassionate person, at least in any way that could make me an attractive friend, mate, or employee)and how they're valued - it's decided from without. You *need* what you cannot create yourself, which is others' approval.  \n\nYour \"friends\" at school, and how they treat you. Your parents, who bring you into the miserable cesspool of mortal existence through no fault of your own. Your teachers. Your boss. The collective animus of your class, such a big deal - the first mob you encounter.\n\nMy God - \"the group\" whatever the group is.\n\nPotential mates obviously.\n\nAs I sit here two weeks after another job assignment ended recovering from surgery and having wasted another week without studying anything because it's all so fucking purposeless and disconnected to work (I found out a lot of coursera courses don't give solutions) - I'm thinking about this and just overwhelmingly suicidal. Or at a minimum, like I never want to be around or engage people again. I never want to work again; I never want to be in an office around people again.\n\nI already have to lie to people socially when they ask about my life; the pursuit of social connection itself is an enormous, pathetic conceit - another sweaty desperate interview I will give a lackluster performance in. \n\nIt is all I can do, year after year, to live with the things that fall from the sky; the ways I fail; the \"mistakes\" that define a life. The problems I cannot solve. *They problems that get worse*, and make me more abnormal. \n\nThat in and of itself, that lack of self-sufficiency - that's a character flaw that sends you out to sea and makes you someone people don't want to be around. You all know that; *that's this forum exists* and lives. That's why some of you understand, you're probably not going to be transients here. There's only a few spaces as you endure life where you can talk about what fills your brain all day and it's all the ways to feel alone, and what it does to you. That remove, and the ambient bleakness you feel waking up in the morning, doing your job (if you lack one or you only have shitty reminds that remind you you're a piece of waste in society, this is doubly try), and being reminded that the past behind you and the future ahead are ugly. \n\nIt's a rung lower than loneliness, even if its an offshoot; I do not hate myself, but I know the things that make me unhappy are hateable qualities. That's enough. That's sufficient to poison a life.\n\nThose of you older than 30 here realize this if you either really assess your relationships - work, any leftover friends you might have from a time of your life it was possible to make them, familial disappointment or, equally, the resentment you feel of yourself because the people you love still cannot actually help you....people and their expectations exhaust me. The debts I feel I owe to my family while hating them all the while do.\n\nThere are times I wish I could turn to my friends and family and tell them - do you have any idea how much effort this is taking out of me, just to be here? \n\nOr to my friends - do you know both how important and how difficult it is when I see you once every year or two and how hard it is to be around you all, who got to grow up and succeed, when I didn't? When my life is secretly defined by trying to pass the time and not think about it?\n\nIf you're an FA people you figure out how and why you don't fit into society or you're otherwise contemptible and just that knowledge leaves you with in a state of weariness and low key paranoia because you know generally - no one will ever really love you or reciprocate....your desire to be friends knowing you fully. Your desire to work for someone. \n\nThis is such a cliche - the older I get...I wasn't made for these times, for a present where you are always accountable for your past, for the exhortation of perpetual self-optimization that leads nowhere and feels like the squandering of time you should have spent on something else in a race against the clock - get more skills, save for surgery, do XYZ towards becoming part of a couple, pitching, and \"branding\". \n\nI'm *so tired*. I'm tired of human society. I'm so fucking tired of myself and maintaining a meat husk. \n\nIf you're thirty and older, FA, and otherwise a loser and lacking in one thing you can do for your own happiness - waking up every morning is horrible. The world and your own brain are a long, constricting corridor with a choking point  - you won't know where you'll encounter it. You can only envision it. \n\nAnd you can't turn back or get time back. \n\nI know this is word salad; I'm setting that marker because for those of you that college aged or close, your feelings are all valid; but....it's like the clock striking midnight once you're out of your 20s. Stick a fork in it - it's pretty much impossible to start over. Leaving your 20s and that \"post-college\" phase really does change you, physically and mentally. It's changed what you have access to; it's changed how you're seen and scrutinized for what you should have learned or accomplished in youth you can never get back. That's why I guess this is mostly addressed to older posters here, in a forum where I feel they either or leave or go to fa30.\n\nI want to try to make life bearable until my father dies. I have accepted I'm going to die alone; my sex drive is almost dead but it doesn't make the loneliness, rejections or the general sense that no one cares what you think or about your feelings in any context of your life any less horrible.\n\nExcept in forums, like these, among strangers.\n\nIf you related to any of this garbling, I'm listening.

Once we were at her place. Watching a movie. We were cuddling and laughing and it was amazing. I really never wanted that day to end. Before I went home we kissed and hugged eachother (it was my first kiss so I was probably pretty bad). After that I felt like she started losing interest.

But I could have dealt with this. We talked through it. She told me she still loved me and missed me. However, a few weeks later one of my friends showed me a screenshot of her on Tinder. I felt so crushed. Again. Why is it that I'm never good enough? I genuinely feel like this was my only chance at a relationship and it didn't work. I still can't get over her.

Saying that she couldn't believe I would do that to her when she thought she was just talking to a friend the whole time...... In my shame I apologised saying that she was right, I should have known better. But I wasn't wrong about her feelings and what she said to me. I knew she felt that way and for her to shoot me down that way makes my mind race as to why. Did another guy come along who she felt was far superior? Was someone else always there? The only strong feeling I get in honesty is that she needed my attention to give her that ego boost, lied about her feelings and shot me down when I tried to move forward and offered no apology by admitting that yes she had led me on.

It\u2019s really as simple as \u201cno one likes me, and the loneliness is crushing\u201d.\n\nMy mother has severe untreated mental illness, and has been emotionally abusive all my life. Lately, she most enjoys spending her days sending me scathing hate mail (particularly on holidays, or when she knows I have an exam coming up). Without any response from me to fuel this. It\u2019s been 2 years of no contact on my end. She actively tries to destroy my relationships with other family members, friends, and professional contacts (eg telling people I\u2019m abusive, sending me emails stressing how the friends I have \u201cdon\u2019t really like me\u201d and people only \u201ctolerate\u201d me). I\u2019ve got pretty low self-esteem to begin with/serious self-doubt, and it really doesn\u2019t help. I\u2019m now seeing a psychiatrist/have been in therapy which helps a bit, but it doesn\u2019t really undo the damage. It kills me that my own mother despises me. \n\nMy dad doesn\u2019t care to know me or my life. The only time he demonstrates concern for my \u201cwelfare\u201d is when faced with the prospect that he might lose his bragging rights (eg I had to take a medical leave of absence from medical school, and suddenly he cared a lot about \u201cmaking sure I didn\u2019t get lazy!\u201d and \u201cthis is just temporary - right? RIGHT?!\u201d). He never calls. He never visits. He doesn\u2019t work and has all the time in the world.  When we do talk, all he\u2019s concerned about is my educational progress (\u201cNew scholarships? Where\u2019s your MD at? How much longer before your Master\u2019s is finished? How about that (highly identifiable diploma program in a particular area of specialization)?\u201d). He used to drive out of town 2 hours (one way) every week to see my brother in prison. I\u2019m along that route/only one extra hour away so I\u2019d repeatedly volunteer to meet him in the town where he meets my brother. He would never call to let me know when he was coming up, nor would he ever commit to dates. I\u2019d only hear about it later. Yet everyone under the sun hears about \u201chow proud\u201d he is of me, and \u201chow much I take after him\u201d. I end up in the hospital and he doesn\u2019t even text. He ends up in the hospital and I head out day or night (several times over...). He hardly knows me, and has no desire to. If I want to see him around the holidays, I have to practically beg him to make time for me (and naturally, I\u2019ll be the one to drive down to visit). This year it all just made me feel worthless. \n\nThe latter statements can be applied to most of my family. I exist, but no one ever calls (I\u2019m always having to do the calling, and heaven forbid I leave a message for someone to \u201ccall me back when they have a chance!\u201d because I\u2019m younger therefore it\u2019s my place to be doing all the calling, apparently). Few ever respond when I call or text. It\u2019s not like I don\u2019t try. It\u2019s not like I don\u2019t make active efforts to be in their lives (attending grads, bday parties, just wishing people \u201chappy Monday!\u201d Or \u201cgood luck on that interview!\u201d Etc). People will tell me about their lives but never ask me about mine. I remember their significant dates, but hardly anyone remembers my birthday. And it\u2019s not like they don\u2019t even care sometimes, more like they actively dislike me, for reasons I don\u2019t fully understand. Like, I never participate in gossip about other family members (my family is quite drama-prone/gossipy...), and recently I\u2019m hearing that my mother, grandmother, and one aunt are saying terrible things about me. Crazy stuff too. Like, that I accused other family members of arson (?! Oddly specific). Or that I married my husband only for his money (?! I worked before/saved, and I go to med school...when I graduate, I\u2019ll be more than capable of supporting both of us!). I get there\u2019s a lot of untreated mental illness in my family but...I mean really? I\u2019m not even in the same city as everyone else/contact is pretty distant and pleasant on my end, so just...why? I mean, I do have one supportive aunt who I love to death...but that\u2019s more or less all I have going on for \u201clegitimate\u201d family. Yet I elope, and all of a sudden everyone is up in arms because \u201cweddings are for the family!\u201d (quote-un-quote) and \u201cclearly you didn\u2019t care enough to have us there!\u201d. Sigh. \n\nThat more or less applies to all my friends as well. I\u2019ve always taken the \u201cif you want to have a friend, you have to be a friend\u201d quote to heart, and I really do try to be supportive and engaged in people\u2019s lives. I thought I had made some good close friends in high school/undergrad - people who I thought actually knew me as a person somewhat. Especially my high school best-friend. When they moved elsewhere for university, I made every effort to make sure I was staying in touch...texting weekly to check in, calling them, making sure not to miss important dates/life events etc...and then one day they just stopped replying (yet were still talking to mutual friends/even visiting with them when they were in town). And deleted their social media (fair enough, I mean I get a \u201csocial media cleanse\u201d as much as the next person). They have the same phone number as they did in undergrad (listed on their LinkedIn) and I text it every once in awhile (\u201chope life is treating you well - we should catch up sometime!\u201d \u201cHappy birthday!\u201d \u201c(Bob) told me you scored a job at (impressive company)- a huge congrats! They\u2019re lucky to have you!\u201d). I\u2019ve been sending them e-birthday/Christmas gifts for years (small donations to charities they supported in their name). I don\u2019t want to pester/harass people, so it\u2019s not like these are inundating messages...just every once in awhile. I gave up this year. I have one true friend from junior high, and we keep in touch, but she lives far away and we don\u2019t get to see each other often (when we do, it\u2019s great!). I occasionally try to reach out to friends past via Facebook/ask about what\u2019s going on for them, with highly variable responses...most recently, I reached out to a formerly close male friend to ask about his life, and he wanted to meet up for a \u201cfriendly catch up coffee\u201d. And then tried to pressure me into a romantic relationship (despite knowing I\u2019m married, and that the meeting was intended to be strictly platonic). It was uncomfortable, so I just sort of thew in the towel with Facebook. \n\nI have a lot of acquaintances at med school who I care about a lot. But that\u2019s all they are - acquaintances. I could tell you lots about them (whenever I meet someone new I always try to find 1) something to remember about their appearance so I don\u2019t forget them 2) something to remember about what\u2019s going on in their lives so I can ask them about it next time we meet, and 3) something to genuinely compliment them on), but I doubt they could tell you anything about me. Because we never talk about that...no one ever asks me how I am, or what I\u2019ve been up to. People I\u2019ve known/seen daily for 2 years don\u2019t even seem to know my name (as was recently revealed in one very awkward interaction).\n\nI try really, really hard. It\u2019s been 2 years with this class, and so far no luck as far as making legitimate friends. I tried taking the bull by the horns and organizing a few social activities early into med (eg a hiking day out, a pumpkin carving/horror movies evening for Halloween) for people in one of our ongoing project groups, and while people showed up to the first one (and all sort of bonded with each other while I played hostess...I should have been more present in hindsight), out of 10 people who committed to the latter event only 3 showed up the day of (one for 15 minutes to say hi before heading out to another event, one to drop off snacks because they felt bad they couldn\u2019t stick around, and the remaining one hung out for a bit then left within the hour). There was a lot of crying on my part later that night, and a ton of food gone to waste. No one said anything the next time we were all together (not that I acted dejected or anything, or brought it up). Just didn\u2019t seem to matter to anyone (and clearly at least 3 people were aware that the event totally bombed for lack of attendance). Worse, more than half the group ended up coordinating to go on a holiday to Mexico later in the year. Turns out it was an opt-in thing, and everyone heard about it but me (\u201coh...I thought they told you...we\u2019ll take pictures...\u201d). I didn\u2019t say anything about it but...I was (am) really hurt. I do everything I can to get people to like me. I smile and say \u201chi\u201d to everyone I know in the halls. I volunteer to take notes when people are sick/away. I volunteer to coordinate meetings etc for our group (which isn\u2019t fun, with like 10 people with conflicting schedules + busy preceptors). I share my summary notes/good resources I find on our class social media pages. I house and pet-sit for free (a bit of a touchy point for me right now...I\u2019m currently missing school to stay at home with our critically ill pet, and asked these same people if they\u2019d mind sharing their notes from a few upcoming non-recorded lectures with me. Not one person said yes). I even started bringing in baked goods for meetings etc...people seem to like the baked goods, but are pretty indifferent about me. I eat alone at lunch every day, usually holed up in an empty classroom somewhere, which is at least good for getting work done on my laptop. I used to try to casually join groups of people I know when they were eating/playing video games or whatever in the student lounge, but I was always a third wheel (not really included in the conversation, couldn\u2019t really easily enter the conversation aside from playing the part of enthusiastic listener, etc. Literally people would make plans to meet up after class and check the availability of everyone but me, while I was standing right there awkwardly. It wasn\u2019t even a \u201cit\u2019s implied you can join us\u201d thing...more like a \u201calright I\u2019ll call ahead and make table reservations for 7/8 of the people standing here, to finish the conversation 8/8 of us have been having for the last hour...\u201d). I just gave up after awhile. It\u2019s like people see right through me. Same goes for sitting with people in class...I don\u2019t even bother anymore. Everyone has such clearly established \u201cgroups\u201d they talk to and sit with (honestly it feels like high school all over again). I enter and exit lecture halls through the back doors so I don\u2019t have to walk awkwardly up the aisle in front of everyone, desperately trying to make eye contact with someone who would invite me to join them. Because I inevitably end up sitting by myself in the very back row anyways. In the past I\u2019ve tried striking up friendly conversation with people I know (when the lecture hall is just filling up) and eventually asking them if they want to join me...but they always have somewhere else to be/need to save seats for X many people. I don\u2019t want to be paranoid, but...there\u2019s a pattern. For awhile I became too anxious to even go to class, because it just feels like I\u2019m someone no one wants around/a general inconvenience, and I\u2019m embarrassed to go outside because I feel like something is deeply and inherently wrong with me. Going to class just makes me feel like a lesser person, not good enough to associate with everyone else.  \n\nAlright, so my family is dysfunctional (lots are), and my class is cliquey (as many are), old friends are too busy (reasonable), no big deal, says I. I\u2019ll find friends elsewhere. So I join a free friend-finding app thing...looks like Tinder, but your profile is just about you and what sorts of things you might like to do with a friend (eg catch up over a coffee, go skiing, etc). I put so, so much effort into my profile. My husband and best friend (recall: the one who lives out of town) proof-read and approved it, because at this point I worry that I just don\u2019t come across as normal/interesting. I was on it for months before I finally had some mutual responses (not for my lack of receptiveness). All of those have ghosted. Recently I made two contacts over the last few weeks (looks like a lot of people were joining over the holidays). One has seemingly ghosted, the other ghosted after one (what I thought had been really successful) meeting for coffee. The latter was so much worse, because we had been talking really frequently for 2 weeks and actually got into some relatively deep stuff (eg our rather compatible thoughts on politics, why we went into our professions, that her parents didn\u2019t approve of her path in life etc), had met up for a few hours, and then all contact promptly ceased. Like, maybe I was ok enough on paper, but something was wrong with me in person? I\u2019m super attentive to my hygiene, so I know I don\u2019t smell or anything. I\u2019m also super nervous about offending everyone, so my sense of humour is pretty mild and I\u2019m not prone to discussing controversial stuff, or making unkind remarks...I just don\u2019t get it. I tried my very best to ask her about lots of things going on in her life, because I\u2019m taking \u201cHow to Win Friends and Influence People\u201d to heart. I\u2019m admittedly disproportionately devastated. I\u2019ve sent a few \u201cHey, how goes life?\u201d and \u201cthere\u2019s some event going on at blablabla...want to join?\u201d sort of follow-up messages since...she responded weeks later with \u201coh, I don\u2019t think I\u2019ll be able to meet up before my (3 month long) upcoming trip. We\u2019ll have to wait until I get back\u201d. Writing\u2019s on the wall. \n\nI feel like I\u2019m a good person. At least I really try to be. And that I could be likeable/interesting if people tried to get to know me. I really try to make people happy (maybe I\u2019m too much of a people-pleaser?), I\u2019m empathetic, and I\u2019m flexible/open to trying new activities. I really do genuinely love getting to know people. I know I\u2019m a bit socially awkward, but (at least according to my best friend) I come across as \u201creally shy\u201d vs \u201cweird\u201d. I\u2019m not socially inappropriate, I\u2019m positive, look happy, and I try to listen more than I talk. I volunteer with a crisis line and I\u2019ve only ever gotten really good reviews for my interactions. My reviews from our standardized patients at school have always been good (\u201cgood rapport, clearly empathetic, a little shy but was a great listener...\u201d), and my anonymous peer reviews at school too (perplexingly, I\u2019m thought very likeable/empathetic according to those metrics, but not liked in person?). So while I know I\u2019m a bit socially awkward, I don\u2019t think I\u2019m socially off-putting. I know I don\u2019t share much about what\u2019s going on in my life (I\u2019m always afraid I\u2019ll talk too much about myself/seem arrogant) so I probably come across as a bit boring/distant. But even if I\u2019m boring, I don\u2019t think I warrant being ghosted etc. I mean, it\u2019s not like I\u2019m exactly a volatile personality type either - I\u2019ve never been one to let others know when I\u2019m upset (eg even when everyone bailed on my party), because I don\u2019t want to make anyone uncomfortable. I do know I\u2019m quiet, and I do know I\u2019m introverted/not the most outgoing...but I really do make efforts. I \u201cget out there\u201d. I have lots of passions and am in the community doing lots of things/engaging with fellow humans. There\u2019s that saying that \u201cif everything around you stinks, maybe it\u2019s you\u201d and I\u2019ve taken it to heart. But when people have an anonymous means of communicating any social issues with you (peer or patient reviews) you\u2019d think you\u2019d hear about it. I\u2019ve asked both my husband and my best friend to please tell me honestly if they think anything I\u2019m doing/not doing is off-putting (to clarify, my friend is pretty brutally honest). They\u2019ve both told me I\u2019m really shy, but otherwise totally pleasant/normal. Maybe they\u2019re just being kind? \n\nI just give up. I\u2019m so lonely. I know that\u2019s probably less justified than many on here because I have my husband, but it\u2019s how I feel. I legitimately look forward to my psychiatry appointments (anxiety disorder) because aside from my husband and best friend, she\u2019s pretty well the only person that knows the real me/actually wants to know about what\u2019s going on in my life (though I appreciate that she\u2019s paid to do that). And it\u2019s not like I\u2019m wholly alone, and I get that (my husband is my everything, I have my best friend who I text, my in-laws are nice to me)...somehow I just wish that I had a broader social group. Like, I love my husband more than life itself and I love coming home to him every day/having him near...but he\u2019s the only social support I have in town. It might be nice to have a school friend. Or a gym friend. Or someone I could drag along for cheap pedicures. I dunno. He knows I\u2019m lonely and encourages me to try the friend-finding app etc. Sometimes it feels like he\u2019s the only one who has ever really loved me, and I am so grateful for him. I just wish I had some other people who cared about me too...friends at school or at my volunteer placements or what have you. I feel like if I were to drop dead today, the only people who\u2019d be at my funeral would be my husband (and I guess in-laws), best friend, and one aunt. I\u2019m like a mid-20s Eleanor Rigby. And I\u2019m trying everything. \n\nIt\u2019s all just frustrating, and deeply disillusioning. I\u2019ve tried so hard, but I just give up. ", "subreddit": "lonely"}

I just want to be everyone\u2019s best friend, and even though she was my best friend, I know I wasn\u2019t hers.

I really should be over it by now, but instead of dealing with it, I've just pushed it down. Over and over again, just like any healthy person does /s\n\nI was with my so-called 'friends' after school. I'd gone off to the bathroom, and as I was coming back I overheard those words. \"Things would be so much better if \\[my name\\] wasn't here.\" I don't remember what my other friend said, but it was something about me doing all the work when we had group assignments.\n\nI think that day a part of me died. These people had been my 'friends' for years, or at least I thought they were. They'd just been using me, and I'd been too blind to see it.\n\nI started spending more and more time alone. I found a kind of safety in indifference. If I didn't let anyone near me, then no one could hurt me.\n\nThe rest of school, it was easy. I would sit in the back of the classroom and throw myself into my schoolwork, and at recess and lunch I would escape into whatever book I was reading. A fake world was less painful than the real world. To be honest, it still is.\n\nAt university it was even easier. I would just go to class, and then go home. I didn't even know most of my classmates' names. And until now, it was easy at work too. I'd just show up, do my work and go home. I was working on my own most of the time, so it was easier still.\n\nBut now that I'm here, in my new job (\\~1 year), I don't know what's changed. I guess being around the same people day after day, it's getting harder to maintain that wall of indifference. Or maybe I've been lonely for so long that I just can't keep it contained any more. I want to have friends, but the thought of letting my guard down scares me.\n\nEither way, my social skills have atrophied past the point of no return, so I guess it's pointless to even care about any of this.

I went out with them a few times and got added to the group's group chat so I could better communicate with them all when we went back to school in September. One key moment was Secret Santa on the 23rd we all watched the Last Jedi in the cinema before going back to L's garage (Which was turned into a lounge type area) where we opened each other's gifts. I loved it, it was the first time breaking out of my anxious bubble and I had begun socialising with everyone, I finally felt like my anxiety was going away and they were all supportive of me. This all changed however just before the last Summer hit when we were doing exams, 3 people joined the group and 1 had even left. That's when G started to dislike L which caused tensions within the Group and a rivalry, then during the summer G had also started to dislike C, M's Girlfriend, which almost caused a split as L, His girlfriend H, C and M didn't feel comfortable going out with G because he didn't like them. Then came a trip in the mid-summer, Me, G, M, D, O, A all went and it was a four-week thing; 1st week in accommodation, 2nd camping, 3rd and 4th working with the community. The trip was great I got my first Gf and this is where my anxiety felt like it was 100% gone but something on that trip happened which broke the group. M had begun falling for another girl and after the trip he broke up with C, then T and E (who weren't on the trip) broke up almost simultaneously. These break-ups caused a three-way split in the group. There was G's group which was made up of people he went out drinking with as well as M, L's group which was made up of most of the girls and were united in their hatred for G and M, and Me the Neutral people who didn't want to take a clear side who were waiting for all this to blow over (it didn't). Everyone became very secretive of when they were going out often keeping to their own groups casting out those that were neutral like me. We returned to college and now every weekend nothing but extreme loneliness washes over me realising that we'll never go back to when we all went out together and were happy, I know they still go out but in their own groups. My anxiety has come back twofold, My GF broke up with me and College is stressful. On the 23rd of december I sat in my bed crying realising that exactly 1 year ago we were all in the garage laughing and talking to each other and I was named the best maker of tea. I still keep in contact with the few that have Xbox (mainly M who has recently got back with C) and I feel thats going to be my only contact with them ever.

We had the same interests, the same humor, played the same instrument and we were way too mature for our age. Most of our schoolmates got drunk and went on lots of parties but we didn't find much appeal in all this. Our only differences were that I was very tall and quiet and he was social and outgoing. I was creative and artistic, while he was literate and eloquent.\n\nYears went by and we both had no success with girls, that was until we no longer shared the same class. He started to see other girls, went on parties that we used to despise and eventually he fell in love with the girl he's going to marry now. Whereas I fell heads over heels in love with a girl who was already in a relationship. I couldn't let go of her for years.\n\nWe graduated and my friend got into his first relationship that still lasts to this day. What I've noticed in these seven years they've been together, is that she inspired him to be the best he could possible be. He's 10x more social and eloquent, he is sympathetic and empathetic, confident and charismatic. They are the centre of our clique, they are the couple a lot of our friends look up to and ask them for advice. They have this healthy relationship because they put a lot of effort in it.\n\nHe has grown so much as a person in all these years he has been together with her. I doubt that he would be the same if he didn't had her. I can't help but compare myself with him. He was more social than me and that made all the difference.

(Quick resume of who I'm going to talk about is so you kinda understand) November 9th I started working at my current job and met this girl called Cynthia, she started working the same day as I did so we became friends pretty quickly. Before you get any ideas yes she's kinda my type (Nerdy with glasses, wears hoodies has long brown hair covering her ears and a beautiful eyes but I'm Bi and lately have been feeling more attracted to males if that makes sense, anyways point is she knows that I'm bi we even talked about guys together and went out a couple times and we talked and laughed I was happy, in fact I don't think I've ever been this happy. When I'm with her I feel like a sun rises inside me anyways... Lately I feel as she's been starting to ignore me if that makes sense. She no longer answers to all her messages on Facebook and stuff like that but this post is not about her so I won't go into more detail it's complicated. I don't know why though. We laugh and all but nope. I gotta get over her but I don't want to at the same time. What IF something were to happen... I don't mean romantically but what if there's a hidden friendship in there. I would love to call her my close friend. Lately i've been feeling lonely. More than usual. Even so that I've been seriously considering joining some sort of dating site. I want to find someone who will want to go to the movies with me and have fun. I don't care about looks. I want a friend. I have friends but I feel like I'm disconnected from them. One is crazy about anime, the other about Computers and the last one loves dubstep and stuff like that which I'm not a huge fan of any of these. I miss my friends. I feel pathetic writing this which I know i shouldn't because it's making me feel better. I lied, I constantly lie... When asked If I'm okay I keep answering 'yes'. I'm not okay. I need help. I need company. I need a friend.\nIf you're ever reading this Cyn, please know I'm not expecting anything from you, like I said I'm the one that get's invested too easily. Please don't feel bad for what's happened. I like you, that's all that matters. :)\nTo anyone else reading this, if you need help or simply need to talk to someone, don't wait, get help. Please. Depression is hard. Probably the hardest thing I've ever faced. I keep telling myself and other I'm okay but I'm not. I need help.

{"post_id": "ajc7q9", "created_utc": 1548335123, "title": "Loneliness vs Aloneness.", "author": "Jax_Gatsby", "self_text": "I've been lonely and depressed for a huge part of my life. I've been rejected many times than I can remember. This caused me to become stuck in a loop; because I was lonely I \"put myself out there\" but almost always I was rejected, which made my loneliness worse. I was persistent, but that persistence only caused me more pain, so I stopped.\n\nMost of my time was spent alone, [writing songs](https://soundcloud.com/remedy97/on-my-shoulders) about how lonely I was but not many people listened to it, which made me even more lonely and depressed. Music was the only thing I was passionate about but it was very clear to me that It wasn't going to get me anywhere because no one gave a shit. I woke almost everyday wishing I had died in my sleep. I don't even believe in god and yet some nights I would genuinely pray that I don't wake up in the morning. I even [wrote this song](https://soundcloud.com/remedy97/i-hope) about it.\n\n All of this went on for a while; the rejection, the loneliness, the depression and so on, until I decided to give up. I gave up chasing girls, I gave up trying to become something through my music, I gave up trying to make a lot of money, I gave up trying to be happy and then the strangest thing happened; I started feeling peace more often in my daily life. You see, when I was chasing girls, making music, chasing happiness, doing this and that, it's like I was always tense, always closing my fist really tight. But when I finally gave up it felt so relaxing, I finally let go and opened my fist again and all the tension was gone.\n\nGiving up seems like a crazy thing to do but really, whats crazy is doing the same thing over and over again expecting a different result (like Einstein said). When you give up trying to find love and happiness, you realize that those things are already here, within you. We're always looking towards the future to make us happy in different forms when in reality, the things we want most in life (peace, happiness, love) are *here and now*. No one else can give them to us because most people don't have them either, they're also caught up in the trap of always looking towards the future and never being in the present.\n\nComing to the place where you already are is both simple and challenging. It requires you to truly face yourself; to be by yourself with no distractions at all and just observe your thoughts. Even starting off by doing this 2 minutes a day will make a big difference in your life. I don't want you to believe me though, you're better off just trying it for yourself.\n\nI know how this sounds to most of you, there's a tendency to want to call all of this a \"cope\" or bullshit and just dismiss it and that's fair enough. But truthfully, the moment I gave up trying to be a somebody, I found peace, which was already within me, I was just too busy looking for it elsewhere ( In girls especially).\n\nI've found that it's far better to be a nobody and to accept my aloneness. I no longer feel the need to prove anything to anybody. ", "subreddit": "ForeverAlone"}

{"post_id": "aje2i0", "created_utc": 1548347061, "title": "[Opinion] It is time to admit it, socialization is a learned skill, and it\u2019s hard.", "author": "Uptons_BJs", "self_text": "This is partially a continuation of my previous post that I made here. I\u2019m a shitty sociologist who is procrastinating on revising my paper, so here goes:\r\n\r\nMany day-to-day activities are incredibly difficult on closer analysis. For instance, consider driving: You sit in a steel box that weighs around ~2 tons, hurling down the highway at sustained high speeds far faster than what you can achieve with 2 legs, all while trying to control the thing with a wheel and pedals. But if you ask an experienced driver, not only is the process doable, it is easy and effortless. \r\n\r\nWhen I break down the act of driving, it sounds like a pretty difficult activity. Yet when I step in my car and step on it, it is an intuitive process, like it is second nature to me. Why? Well practice made it easy. Similarly, you will find that many of the things you do every single day is surprisingly difficult, you just don\u2019t notice because you\u2019re really, really good at it. \r\n\r\nNow let\u2019s think about the process of socialization. Imagine a scenario where you\u2019re meeting someone new for lunch with the goal of making a new friend. Should you arrive early and get a table? Or you should wait for them at the door of the restaurant? How should you greet them? Handshake or hug? Will they judge you for what you order? Should you order a drink? What should you talk about? Are you eating too fast? Oh god, how should you let her know that she got ketchup on that white dress? \r\n\r\nIn this simple scenario, your brain is rapidly processing tens, if not hundreds of decisions, and although one single decision isn\u2019t going to sink your encounter, the combination of all these individual decisions is going to decide how comfortable the other person is going to be with you, and probably going to contribute whether or now you will make a new friend. Now imagine if it was a date and throw romantic intentions into that mess of decisions, the difficulty increases exponentially. \r\n\r\nTo much of society, socialization isn\u2019t really hard. Sure, if you break it down that way, it might seem difficult, but like how driving isn\u2019t hard to experienced drivers. In fact, many people don\u2019t acknowledge that socialization could be considered difficult at all, after all, to them socialization comes easily. Plenty of charismatic people would ask \u201chow hard could small talk and table manners be?\u201d\r\n\r\nTo many people, they literally don\u2019t remember socialization being hard at all. Ask drivers about the first time they drove, they\u2019ll probably tell you a story about how they were once a nervous 16 year old. Ask swimmers about the first time they stepped into the pool, they\u2019ll probably tell you that mastering strokes and not drowning was hard. But if you ask charismatic people about socialization, many of them cannot remember a time when it was considered difficult. \r\n\r\nTherefore, many people either think socialization is easy and intuitive, or even reject the idea that socialization is a learned skill completely. This is why some of the most common advice given to people who have difficulty socializing are \u201cshower\u201d and \u201cbe yourself\u201d. After all, if you think socialization is trivial, then either there must be something wrong with you the person (the basis of \u201cshower\u201d, \u201cdress better\u201d, and \u201cget fit\u201d advice) or that your nerves must be inhibiting your socialization skills (\u201cbe confident\u201d). \r\n\r\nThis is where I strongly disagree with the conventional wisdom. To me, there are plenty of people who have nothing repulsive about them (not smelly, dirty, or horrifically ugly), nor is it necessarily nerves that get in the way. In my opinion, it simply comes down to their underdeveloped social skills. To go back to the driving analogy, maybe some people get into accidents not because their car is in poor shape, or that they\u2019re nervous. Maybe they\u2019re just not good at driving. \r\n\r\nI used to work at a child psychology lab, I am not a psychologist, but my lab studied early childhood social development, and some of their shop talk did give me some ideas. Early childhood educators and child psychologists constantly talk about childhood social development, and commonly cite it as a reason for a child\u2019s success or failure in their early socialization. For instance, 4 year-olds who have developed the ability to consistently and reliable pick up the emotions of others through non-verbal cues are usually more successful at making friends and impressing their teachers at school. \r\n\r\nNow the following is purely my hypothesis, but what if the same dynamics extend past early childhood? If we describe social skills as a basket of skills and abilities that one uses to socialize, then one must learn these skills somewhere. \r\n\r\nIf you were to observe the social skills of kids in different age groups, you would realize that kids do pick up social skills as they age all the way through adulthood. For instance, we expect an average 6 year old to be able to sit still and follow basic instructions, 10 year olds are expected to better interpret non-verbal cues and written communication, 15 year olds are expected to be able to articulate their points and change their behavior accordingly depending on social cues. \r\n\r\nBy adulthood, people are expected to possess a wide variety of social skills. You are expected to know how to behave in a large variety of environments, change your behavior accordingly, and act natural. To thrive socially as a young adult, you are expected to have mastered a variety of complex social skills. If you do not have a firm grasp of these skills, others consider you socially awkward or weird. \r\n\r\nBecause the social expectation increases gradually, it is perfectly understandable why most people have never considered socialization difficult. After all, their socialization skills have gradually increased lock step with the expectation society has of their social skills as they aged.\r\n\r\nTherefore, it is my belief that for most people who have difficulties socializing but don\u2019t have mental illnesses or developmental difficulties, the issue lies in the fact that their socialization skills have never developed to the level expected of them. Or to put it in examples more relevant to this community, if you weren\u2019t able to make friends when you were 6 years old on the playground, you are likely to have difficulties making friends in high school. If you never went on awkward first dates in highschool and college, you are unlikely to have the maturity and composure to impress potential partners at 30. \r\n\r\nNow how do you develop these skills? Well there is no curriculum in socialization. Sure, your parents and teachers probably tried to point you towards the general direction, and they probably cut out the most repulsive behaviors (bullying, lying, etc), but for the most part you were expected to figure it out alone. \r\n\r\nThere is little research on exactly how people develop social skills effectively, because after all, unlike say, mathematics or literacy, it was never part of the formal academic curricula nor is it quantifiable. But here I have a hypothesis: social skills are most effectively developed young, through unstructured playtime with peers of a similar age group and social status. \r\n\r\nUnstructured play time is essentially time when kids spend time playing with each without structure or a formal authority figure. For instance, a few kids playing baseball on the sandlot counts as unstructured play, but a formal little league with coaches and organization doesn\u2019t. Why is unstructured play time so important? Because in the absence of authority figures, kids are being thrust into what is essentially a Lord of the Flies type scenario, where they need to devise their own social structure, communicate and make friends on their own. A few kids playing baseball on the sandlot have to divide up their own teams, resolve their own conflicts, practice sportsmanship, and learn to resolve conflicts on their own. For instance, what do you do when the kid who brought the ball is absolutely terrible? Or what if the best player is a prick and a bully? What do you do when you don\u2019t get picked? These are all dilemmas that these kids must resolve themselves, and in the process, develop important social skills that can be apply elsewhere. \r\n\r\nStructured play time is completely different. In a formal little league, there are coaches and umpires, and there is a set structure of rules that are enforced. In a structured environment, kids don\u2019t really need to develop social skills to thrive, all they need to do is to follow the rules and defer to authority. And under the observation of an authority figure, kids don\u2019t have to learn conflict resolution (IE: two kids have to argue whether someone is out on the sandlot, something they don\u2019t have to do when there is umpire present). \r\n\r\nThis is why often kids who had individual hobbies (IE: video games, reading) and who\u2019s time were strictly structured by parents (music lessons, sports leagues, after school classes, etc) have the most difficulty socializing. Stereotypically, think about which groups are often perceived as having difficulty socializing, they\u2019re the bookworms, the video game addicts, these are all mostly individual hobbies where people engage in them alone. They never had the chance to develop the social skills expected of them that their peers did.\r\n\r\nI\u2019m going to use an example from a few years ago: I went out for lunch with a guy who was considered to be a weirdo by most people who knew him. Now 5 minutes at a nice restaurant and you\u2019ll quickly notice why, he doesn\u2019t understand how to behave at a high end restaurant, he doesn\u2019t pace his conversation well, he has poor table manners. Eating with him was an uncomfortable experience, so people called him a weirdo. But the thing is, he\u2019s not necessarily a weirdo, it\u2019s just that he lacks the social skills needed to dine with others, and well, it\u2019s kind of understandable. This guy plays video games every lunch hour for as long as I can remember, he never went out for lunch with friends, so he never developed the social skills associated with dining with others. \r\n\r\nBy framing poor social skills as a lack of knowledge instead of a problem with the individual, we can then think about it in a completely different light. The awkward guy who doesn\u2019t know how to flirt? It\u2019s not that there\u2019s something wrong with him as an individual, instead it is a lack of knowledge. We don\u2019t tell people who don\u2019t know how to drive to \u201cwash your car\u201d we say \u201ctake driving lessons\u201d. But instead of telling people who can\u2019t make friends to \u201clearn social skills\u201d, we tell them to \u201ctake a shower\u201d.\r\n\r\nSo what can you do if you never picked up the social skills expected of you while growing up? I don\u2019t know, I\u2019m a shitty sociologist, not a shitty early childhood educator! But I do have some ideas:\r\n\r\nSince for a lot of lonely people how to behave in social situations is not intuitive, you shouldn\u2019t think of it as second nature. Think of it as a form of emotional labor. The \u201cjust be yourself\u201d advice is not useful for people with poor social skills. After all, there is an expectation for how you should behave in various social situations and odds are, your \u201cintuitive behavior\u201d does not align with these social expectations.\r\n\r\nMy second piece of advice is to observe and people watch. Put yourself out there, follow others, and try to observe what they do. I used to feel awkward because I didn\u2019t know how to behave at academic conferences, so what did I do? I asked everyone who was presenting a poster if I can tag along and help out, just hand people pamphlets and stuff. I went to these conferences and just observed what other people were wearing, how they spoke to others and how to make connections. After enough of them, I picked up enough to not seem or feel awkward anymore. \r\n\r\nFinally, one should seek out proper socialization advice. If you didn\u2019t figure out these skills intuitively in your childhood, stand on the shoulder of giants and go read a book. I don\u2019t know which books are the best nowadays, perhaps you can start with How to Make Friends and Influence People?\r\n\r\nPS: if you\u2019re lonely, looking for a friend or wingman and you live in the Toronto area, why don\u2019t you drop me a message? Not an organ harvester, just a shitty sociologist. ", "subreddit": "ForeverAlone"}

I couldn't understand why he was in this group. He seems to be successful in everything he does. We're bound by privacy agreements so I don't want to get too specific, but everything he does from his job to his hobbies is all sunshine and rainbows. Most notably with women. They're almost all he talks about\n\nMeeting 1: he told a long boring story that caused me to lose interest. As I understood it while not paying full attention, his roommates offered him group sex and he was worried about not being manly enough. I was so irked that I confronted him about this privately, but it turned out I had just misheard and something completely different had happened. Still, it was a sign of things to come. In the rest of that first meeting he talked about how his ex-girlfriend had begged him not to go on vacation because she knew she would cheat on him, then he left and she did cheat, then they broke up, but they felt they had a deep soul bond and were meeting regularly.\n\nMeeting 2: he talked about how he managed to bring home different women three nights in a row, and had sex with two of them.\n\nMeeting 3: he had found a new girlfriend, but invited his ex to do something that involved prolonged skin-to-skin contact and stay overnight on his couch, and he had a spat with his new GF over that.\n\nMeeting 4: he talked about how he and his new GF were fucking like bunnies, but he felt all insecure because it was too soon after the last relationship and he needed space. Also another woman in his life wrote a song for him. I called him out on this in front of the group, pointing out how good he had it and asking to switch lives with him. Everyone else laughed in agreement.\n\nI've only scratched the surface of this dude! There is much more I can't tell you \u2014 every one of these incidents is accompanied by a bunch of bizarre behaviour that makes me wonder how he attracts women at all. The behaviour accompanying incident #2 was so bizarre that I asked him for his contact information and arranged a meeting to discuss his methods.\n\n---\n\nFirst, I asked him why he was in the group. He said he had plenty of \"feminine energy\" (no surprise there) and needed more masculine in his life, plus he wanted motivation to improve.\n\nThen I asked him to tell me the full story of the consecutive encounters of meeting 2, saying no detail was too small. I won't tell *you* the full story, just the major points and his advice.\n\nThe first and the one he didn't have sex with was an old friend. The story of how they met was just eye-watering, like something out of a porno or fantasy. He didn't have sex because...he didn't feel \"called\" to this person. But it turned out they did go pretty damn far, something he'd left out at the party.\n\nThe second was a Tinder date. Enough said.\n\nThe third was a newer friend he'd met a few weeks before. With both her and woman 1 he described how they had hugged, and he felt her relax and fall into him. Their story was one of a few near-sexes that petered off, but eventually it just \"happened\". It turned out that this is the woman who became his new girlfriend in meeting 3.\n\nHe gave me two major pieces of advice. Most relevant to me was to approach without expectations, and not to place too much pressure on the encounter. He didn't meet any of these women with sex on his mind. An alternate piece of advice, meant for a later stage of dating, is to promote comfort and safety in your partner. This matches advice I've heard elsewhere: women are just as sexual as men, but need to feel fully safe to express it.\n\nHe recommended a book to me and we parted ways.", "subreddit": "ForeverAlone"}

It's been a slow day.\n\nWoke up around 5am, walked in the pouring rain to grab a coffee and reach a bus stop at 6, to arrive at college by 8 for a class. It ended at 9:15 and I went and just did a few school related things to settle down the semester until another class started at 11. That was a tough class, and they're using some mcgrawhill Connect online thing so it sounds like Im forced to pay for an expensive book with money that doesn't exist, on top of whatever other academic costs there are this semester. Sadly found out the bus leaves 2 min before class ends at 12:15, so I waited around until the next came around 1pm. In the middle of getting home, I have to transfer to another bus, but it never came so I had to wait a total of an hour in a crowded, humid area with ppl asking me for change. Once I finally got home by 3pm, I was drenched. Everything in my backpack was wet, and my pants look like I stepped out of a pool. My shoes will still be soaked through tomorrow. Nothing healthy to eat, my mom bought Chinese food again. The house is also a cluttered mess due to us emptying a storage cuz we're low on money. Went to go play Eve: Online, a spaceship game just to get killed the moment I got on unluckily by a guy who was cloaked(hidden) in a weird spot and just came back from a smoke break. Switched to league of legends, lost a game before it even started cuz people chose characters that were too tough for them to use or just bad. So now I'm downstairs to get away from everything and sit on here cuz I got no one to talk to. Commenting on other people's posts and trying to make them feel better usually helps me feel better about myself.\n\nIt's not that I'm so lonely I can't take it- granted I have those times where it does feel that way. Honestly, I feel like I have it better than a lot of people on here. Maybe that's harder for me to judge than I realize. I don't hang with anyone in school. I don't know how to approach a girl I want to talk to without feeling like a weirdo (also, she's been around some other dude so it's hard to catch her alone). I sit around listening to music or watching anime on a bus all day. 5 days a week this is my life.\n\nI don't know where I'm going with all of this. I appreciate anyone listening. Sure it's been a tough day, but i don't care all too much. I want you guys to stay encouraged. Message me to talk, about whatever you feel like talking about. I'm gonna go look through more posts to see if I can lend some helpful advice or make someone feel better who deserves it (almost everyone deserves it haha)\n\nTL;DR - it's been a slow, difficult day for me, but it doesn't matter as long as I can help someone here out.

I had to add a few people who\u2019s usernames were just a bunch of letters and numbers. Like how do y\u2019all even remember your names if you need to log in? Lol, but I still y\u2019all complicated swiggas because everyone needs a friend. But friiiiick. It\u2019s not easy. Unless there\u2019s an easy way to add people that doesn\u2019t require I manually type in the name and I\u2019m just being an idiot.\n\nEdit: As of February 11, there hasn\u2019t been much activity in the chat. The chat has helped me not feel lonely so I don\u2019t use it everyday like before. But I will gladly still add anyone who asks.", "subreddit": "lonely"}

I'm being honest and trying no to hide anything, but I'm feeling very invalidated by this so please bear with me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI was told that I can't be a FA'er because I've been is a relationship before, and I'm female. One of those reasons is obviously bullshit, but the other has me questioning. I'm still a virgin \"in the eyes of the lord\" because I was afraid of losing it yet. I was my ex's first relationship, and he was my first non-online relationship. We had known each other for years and he was my best friend before we started our relationship. It was a really nice relationship for the first couple months. He was there for me when my life was crumbling around me. I was vulnerable around him, and he took advantage of that.\n\nBoth he and I were desperate for love, and things got sexual fairly quickly. His libido is/was abnormally high, and he was always down for some action. I was afraid to lose my virginity yet, but still wanted to make him feel good. Our sexual encounters were restricted to my boobs and butt, and his everything. But it wasn't enough for him. When we would sleep together, or rather sleep in the same bed, he would sometimes molest my no-no square. He only did it while I was sleeping so I didn't find out. The first time, I think, he did it he felt bad about it and told me the next day. He knew what is was doing was wrong, but continued doing it, and like the naive idiot I am I let it happen. Then one day he did it I woke up while it was happening. It was our first year anniversary. \n\nI was still lonely and desperate so I let it slide again although I said I wouldn't months ago when it happened the first time. More life struggles and I end up living in a homeless shelter for woman dealing with domestic abuse( both my parents were abusive but that's a whole different story). He didn't want to take me in so I didn't much have any other options. eventually I got kicked out of there because it was only an emergency shelter. I had learned a lot about different forms of abuse while being there. My ex took me in because I had nowhere else to go. \n\nIt the single months that lasted I started understanding more about the foundations of our relationship. He didn't really like me. Everything was about him. He never did anything I wanted to do. I did what he wanted to do even though I didn't like or want to do it. We could never just plain cuddle, he always tried getting me worked up for sex. He always treated me like a sex toy. I was there just to get him off. He would spank me in public even though we had multiple talks about how I wasn't comfortable with that. He would even insult me for things I couldn't control like my ADHD, or my \"neutral ugliness\". I had enough and ended up breaking up with him.\n\nThe reason why I feel I'm still a FA'er even though that I had a relationship, after 20 years of pure loneliness, I feel like it was a real one. It seemed pretty one sided to me. I liked him because I thought he was a good person and appearance doesn't matter. He just wanted me because he was horny and wanted sex with a girl. Though I was in a relationship I was still alone. It's only been 8 months since my relationship of 13 months ended. The relationship only happened because I was a girl, and nothing else. So I can see were both of the reasons why \"I can't be a FA'er\" may be valid, but I wanted your opinions on the matter.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nGo easy on me, I am not in a stable mental condition and am easily triggered/upset...", "subreddit": "ForeverAlone"}

(Alert: I may have a date tomorrow!)", "author": "fastzander", "self_text": "In this post: [https://www.reddit.com/r/ForeverAlone/comments/a9mp6k/thinking\\_about\\_going\\_out\\_and\\_approaching\\_one/](https://www.reddit.com/r/ForeverAlone/comments/a9mp6k/thinking_about_going_out_and_approaching_one/), I contemplated the possibility of going out every night for a month and approaching at least one woman each time, and posting a nightly account on this sub. In this post: [https://www.reddit.com/r/ForeverAlone/comments/ab5n1z/welp\\_im\\_gonna\\_do\\_it/](https://www.reddit.com/r/ForeverAlone/comments/ab5n1z/welp_im_gonna_do_it/), I committed to said exercise, in addition to outlining some parameters. Because few bars are open, and few people attend bars, on weekdays, however, I have since amended the exercise; now aiming to speak to three women on Fridays, three on Saturdays and three on Sundays, for the four weekends of January, for a total of 36. The following post comprises my eight such account, my account of the night of 20/01/2019.\n\nSince I began this exercise, the Meetup I\u2019ve been attending on Fridays has been held at one particular bar. As of tonight, it has moved to another, and I condone the change. I like this new bar a lot more than the old one \u2013 it sells more drinks that I like, feels homier, and I had an easier time talking to people at it.\n\nSpoke to two women tonight. (Technically, I spoke to three, but incidentally, I had already spoken to one of them at a previous Meetup, and I consider it cheating to count the same woman twice). The woman whom I had already spoken to already had a boyfriend \u2013 which is a shame (for me, anyway), because the two of us bantered quite warmly with each other, and she was very pretty. I\u2019d definitely ask her for her number if she was single. I spoke to the other two women amiably enough, but I didn\u2019t fancy either of them much, so I didn\u2019t bother asking either of them for their numbers.\n\nTwo shower thoughts. Firstly, I think I\u2019m starting to get better at bantering. While I\u2019ve never had issues with shyness \u2013 with stuttering, or maintaining eye contact, or so on \u2013 I have tended to cycle through a fairly dry sequence of topics when talking to people, i.e\u2026 my name, whether this was my first time at the Meetup, where I was from, my job (or lack thereof), my hobbies, etc. Now, my conversations with people are starting to flow a little more organically. Secondly, I\u2019m meeting many sorts of people at these Meetups that I otherwise likely would never have met. Thus far, I have met, among other people: a cop, an ex-soldier, a scuba-diving instructor, an Indian Institutes of Technology graduate, and a person from Bulgaria, of all places. It is interesting to talk to such people and hear about their experiences \u2013 verily, I believe, are these Meetups a venue for gaining some perspective and worldliness.\n\nAnd now for the part I\u2019m sure you\u2019ve all been waiting for\u2026 I might just have a date tomorrow night! Remember how I got a woman\u2019s number at the bowling alley last Sunday? Well, tonight, I texted her, and asked her if she would like to come to tonight\u2019s Meetup. She said no, because she had already gone home from work and she lived quite far away. So then I asked her if she\u2019d like to go out tomorrow, and she said that, although she\u2019d be working during the day, she was going to attend a waterfront fireworks display in the evening, and asked if I\u2019d like to go with her, which I gladly accepted! I\u2019m not sure if this quite counts as a date, but whatever the case, it is unambiguously the farthest I\u2019ve gotten with any of the women I\u2019ve spoken to since I began this exercise. Tomorrow\u2019s account will be of this date, if indeed that\u2019s what it is.\n\n**Tally:**\n\nGoal: 36.\n\nPoints: 14.\n\nBrownie points: 4.\n\nRejections: 0.\n\nPhone numbers: 2.\n\nAgain; ***polite***, ***constructive***, ***good faith*** suggestions are appreciated.

My sister is even so bad that when I've told her I felt like I was on the titanic, in the desperate hopes that she would stop being such a jerk and maybe help for once, she had the gall to call me out for supposedly being offensive to those that died on the titanic, and did not change her behavior in the slightest\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMY \"friends\",   and I use that term VERY loosely, are little better, that vast majority of them make ZERO effort, some to such an extent that they blatantly ignore  my messages to them, and never initiate themselves.

And also I was told that I needed to find a better use of my time than just reading online posts. So I put these two needs together and figured I'd used Reddit to meet new people. It didn't take long for me to find a wide range of sub Reddits for making friends and communicating with others. I had to load a few apps but that was okay. I quickly learned that most people who post about wanting someone to talk to really aren't in to talking. I would find the most recent posts and respond to anywhere from 10 to 20 posts a day. Of that maybe 1 or 2 would actually respond back. After a week of this I got quite frustrated. I didn't know if it was only me. Or maybe because I was messaging mostly women. So I made a post asking women if they were having the same lack of success as the men (I noticed other guys posting similar lack of success. But never from a female only guys). The response was very negative toward me. Some women claimed I was lying while others said I must be acting like a creep. They read through my post history to find that I was single. Making me out as only wanting a sexual friendship. When I had never said nor had I asked that of anyone. But worst was the private messages that just consisted of calling me sexist and a bunch of horrible stuff. I learned that some people don't like people to know that things aren't equal when they are getting the better half. Oh, but mostly to be more careful about what I post and where. Needless to say that my failure to make friends has hurt worse than not having any to start with. Of the people I talked to only a small handful tried to communicate for more than a day. I soon lost the will power to keep trying to find new people. I think now I'm going to remove all the subs from my feed that deal with finding friends. Seeing tons of people posting but knowing that none of them will ever be your friend can't be good for my mental health. I'm not really sure where I go from here. I spent a month trying to find someone to talk to. It was a failure that used up what little social energy I had. I once told someone in a post that people on Reddit come here for attention.

Oh well, I've pretty much lost my \"best buddies\" since we all went to different high schools. My relationship with my parents is superficial. We say we love each other but I feel like we only say that because I'm their son and their my parents. I've barely ever talked to them on how I feel during the entire course of my life. I'm hella fucking nervous and anxious when ever i'm talking to someone since i worry that i might say the wrong thing. I've been bullied through elementary, through middle school, even by my friends. And thanks to that, i having trouble trying to socialize so i just keep my mouth shut most of the time since I'm just so fucking awkward. Thanks to all those years in elementary and middle school of being a reject and being bullied I've became a loner and a loser. I've lost motivation for doing my best and dropped my hobbies. I've lost hope for my future and i have no willpower or motivation to better myself and look for change. I'm a pathetic, sad, lonely, self conscious loser who's never had a girlfriend. Still a sophomore in high school and I still dont have anyone that i can depend when i need help.  I've lied, betrayed people, let people down, disappointed people, and done things that i regretted that I wish I've never done and they still haunt me to this day. All i need is just some human interaction and closure.\n\nSorry if it looks like i'm just looking for attention. All i'm doing is just typing down my thoughts and feelings and wanting to share them.", "subreddit": "lonely"}

It's so bad that I've even forgotten how to show emotion, so everyone just thinks that I'm completely apathetic and they never have any sympathy. Even on the rare occasion that someone asks if I want to be included, my mom (she especially was always emotionally controlling) just butts in and says \"oh don't worry about him he doesn't like socializing\", even though she knows how lonely I really am.\n\nOne particular family from church is like this. They'll always get into conversations with my parents while I have to sit and watch, frustrated. Their kids will greet them, but they'll only smile politely at me if I'm lucky enough to be noticed. This past Sunday, they invited my parents over, and the only reason I got to go is that my parents went there straight from church. Of course, my parents got all the attention while I rotted on the couch, watching TV. Then when we left, I heard the wife tell my mom, \"Sorry about DeputyShotVideo, I was going to give him our wi-fi\". First off, why not just tell it to me? I was sitting right there. Second off, when you have a guest, you don't just throw them onto your Internet and be done with them. Third off, again, she's around my age and she's talking about me like I'm two. I'm angry at the circumstances, not the family (not their fault I'm broken), but she was being incredibly rude with that statement.\n\nIt's really humiliating and hurtful that all I am to these people is my parents' weird son. I know that the only thing I can do about it is to just suck it up and initiate a conversation with one of them. I'm really considering it the next time I see them, but just the thought of it makes me hyperventilate and my hands start to shake.

Got no one to vent to, and figured a nice text block may be in order.   \n\n\nMy life is pretty... packed. I've got two jobs, a mother I look after as a full time carer, and I'm an undergrad (third year) on top of all that. Despite it all, I'm full of ambition, full of drive, and it's pretty difficult for me to stop working at trying to be better and better. Self-improvement is definitely my thing, yet there's always something so huge and impossible to overcome for me despite it all.  \n\n\nLoneliness.  \n\n\nIt's something that started to be a huge problem after my last major relationship, about 3 years ago. It was great - we were together for two years, nothing special, but it was my real first experience of what a 'soul mate' was like, I feel like it started there, after.  \n\n\nEver since, I've craved human contact, emotional dependancy, and generally just having someone that close to me. Back then, when my life was arguably more chaotic, it really held me together. It was great. These days, that deep desire for someone to hold close is something that makes me feel so low when I'm unable to quench it. I'll get so depressed for days at a time over the most minuscule of things - from a date not going well, to feelings not being reciprocated, and so on.   \n\n\nIt's not like I've had nothing since - I've had a few FwB situations, shorter hook-ups and dates, but nothing like that one 3 years ago, and yet it's as if I wouldn't have the time to have a full relationship anyway. So, why does it make me so sad? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI've never been sure, but the feelings that stem from my loneliness are ones I've never been able to settle. It's always there, and so, distracting myself completely from it and suppressing such feelings have been the only way forward. I have too much going on to ever address it, yet, even after today for example, where I've been planning to meet his girl IRL after talking for ages, that she's turned around and revealed she's hooking up with a guy before we were. I'm not angry at her, and we were planning to meet as friends.   \n\n\nStill, a small part of me hoped that maybe something could hit off? That was enough, and thus, I'm here sulking like a fucking idiot, and my thoughts are spiralling into things far more depressing. All these feelings are suddenly returning, and yet tomorrow I'll forget it all, and end up forgetting for the next few weeks.   \n\n\nNot sure if it's ever something I'll be able to overcome. Maybe it's because I'm quite an emotionally dependant guy? Maybe it's a complex? Who knows. It's fine when it's not all in my head, but during times like this, it pretty much paralyses me. It makes me feel so low and undesirable, yet I know that's not true, and I know things are fine in actuality. It's still there, though, regardless.   \n\n\nIt's an integral need for a partner - not just friends, but someone to be so close to, share warmth and comfort with, console with, and to make said person happy as fuck - all that cheesy, spunky bullshit. I love it, and I guess I still really miss it, even after all this time. Can't get my head away from it once it all surfaces. Nothing really does the trick except obtaining what I want. Without it, I can only suppress these feelings.  \n\n\nr/lonely, how do I cope with this? Is there a way to finally file this need away? Even when I'm aiming to pursue a masters degree, learn all these things, and make myself the best I can be, I can still never get away from this hopeless complex of mine. Any advice? Similar woes? Load 'em on me, would be comforting to at least know some people deal with a similar situation to me.", "subreddit": "lonely"}

One was when I was in high school which ended with her cheating on me and leaving me in a very depressed state, the other in my late 20's who I spent almost 5 years with and was a women who I thought I would marry and have kids with everything people look for in life. She left me almost 6 years ago and I have never recovered since. At the time when her and I split I also had a fairly successful business and I had many so called \"friends\", people wanted to hang out with me, wanted to work with me, but when my business came to an end they dried up faster than anyone would imagine. How about that as soon was in a position where I couldn't provide and benefit others they were gone.\n\nSince then I have been so lonely I cannot stand it, I don't really have any family I am close with so I spend all my time working, or browsing around online. When I look back I feel like I have spent the better part of the last 20 years just existing to exist. I have no purpose and I have nothing greater than myself to hold onto to motivate me. I have considered and thought about suicide many times but that isn't the path I want to take, still it doesn't stop the thoughts from popping up in my mind. I have tried anti depressants and other things to no effect. Most recently I even tried a sugar daddy website for affection, which only made me feel worse. Even when attempting to pay someone for some affection I manage to get rejected, which has left me at a real low point.\n\nI have a traveling job so I am usually on the road working 5 days a week, typically this helps to keep my mind busy but for the last month things have been really slow and I have had next to no work. Which has left me super stressed out on top of my usual worries. I want something different out of life. I want to make changes but I really don't know how. Even for meeting people I don't know where to go. At times I think I will do this or that but the reality is I get stuck taking the first step, I don't know if it's out of fear, or if I am just procrastinating. I am overweight, and I know I should join a gym or something but food, or at least shitty food is one of the only comforts I have in my life. Again I don't know what I am hoping to gain from typing this I just don't know what else to do.\n\nIt kills me seeing so many people have normal relationships, I have seen people of all body types, and levels of attractiveness in relationships, hell this time of year from November-Feb the holiday period I notice so many couples and I wonder what makes me so broken, and unwanted, that I literally have nobody. Even something as stupid as watching porn as someone posted here makes me feel unwanted since I know I will never get to experience someone looking at me that way. I am giving myself this year to somehow turn it around I feel like if I can't find a way to improve or enjoy life when I hit 40 then there is no reason to continue. People tell you to love yourself but it really is hard to believe that when nobody else loves you back, I really do feel like a flawed human, I feel like there is something wrong with me, I don't know what makes me so much different than others that makes me unworthy of companionship. I could go on and on, I have only touched the surface of these things. I am lost.\n\n## ", "subreddit": "ForeverAlone"}

In this post: [https://www.reddit.com/r/ForeverAlone/comments/ab5n1z/welp\\_im\\_gonna\\_do\\_it/](https://www.reddit.com/r/ForeverAlone/comments/ab5n1z/welp_im_gonna_do_it/), I committed to said exercise, in addition to outlining some parameters. Because few bars are open, and few people attend bars, on weekdays, however, I have since amended the exercise; now aiming to speak to three women on Fridays, three on Saturdays and three on Sundays, for the four weekends of January, for a total of 36. The following post comprises my ninth such account, my account of the night of 20/01/2019.\n\nTonight\u2019s account will be different, as it is not of an evening at a bar wherein I spoke to other bargoers, but rather of a date which I managed to secure. In case you didn\u2019t read last night\u2019s post; last Sunday, at the bowling alley, I asked for a woman\u2019s number, and received it. Yesterday, I texted her, asking her if she\u2019d like to go on a date tonight, and she said yes.\n\nOur date was at a waterfront to watch some fireworks. I didn\u2019t eat any dinner beforehand, because she failed to specify whether we\u2019d be getting this or not, and I didn\u2019t want to a full stomach in case we did. As it turned out, she\u2019d already eaten herself, so I ought to have done so too, but she agreed to wait and talk to me if I were to get something for myself. We walked along the piers for a bit, went to a restaurant where I ate and the two of us talked (and I swear, she didn\u2019t seem to mind this at all), walked further, watched the fireworks, and then parted (it was night by this time, and her place was quite far away). I had been afraid that I would rapidly run out of things to say, but luckily, instead, conversation seemed to flow naturally between us. However, the woman was going to New Zealand a week from then, so there would be no prospect of a second date or a relationship. Also, I can\u2019t say that I ever sensed a romantic or sexual vibe between us \u2013 either myself for her, or her for myself. All the same, I had a good time.\n\nSo\u2026 yeah, I got a date. Now, I\u2019m sorry if I sound condescending here, but as I\u2019ve said in earlier posts, I\u2019m average looking and possess average social skills. Nevertheless, a mere three weeks into this exercise, I was able to get this date \u2013 which, on its own, I must admit, is more than I ever expected to get \u2013 simply by joining a Meetup, going to bars two or three times a week, talking to two or three women about banal shit for 15 \u2013 30 minutes each time, and having the balls to ask for their numbers at the end. Either \\[A\\]; I happen to have gotten lucky, \\[B\\]; I happen to be unexpectedly, naturally good at this, or \\[C\\]; getting a date is a lot easier than many men make it out to be, much as talking to women and getting phone numbers turned out to be. And my money\u2019s on C. I reckon that if I kept up with this, I could get another date within a month or two.\n\n**Tally:**\n\nGoal: 36.\n\nPoints: 14.\n\nBrownie points: 4.\n\nRejections: 0.\n\nPhone numbers: 2.\n\nDates: 1.\n\nAgain; ***polite***, ***constructive***, ***good faith*** suggestions are appreciated.", "subreddit": "ForeverAlone"}

What I mean by this is that we are always seeking to mate, which means dating and having sex with others so we can spread our genes. Those people that are unable to mate are ridiculed by society because of their inability to mate.\n\nThe reason why society does this is that they view us \"mateless\" people as biological failures, this happens subconsciously which leads to treating virgins and people who've never had a mate really badly, by insulting or ostracizing us. The more we grow older like this, the worse it'll get and the harder it becomes to engage in mating. Being mateless is what also causes depression and loneliness amongst virgins.\n\nNot having ever mated in our lives, our bodies become biological failures which fuel the depression we feel along with the insults received by those who engage in mating regularly. In short, this is all our biological processes that are creating this status quo of virgins being shamed and ostracized, all happening subconsciously which affects our higher brain functions.\n\nFinal Remarks: For as long a human mating remains the same way as it is now or there is no drastic change in our genetic programming, the ridicule, and ostracization of mateless people will continue, regardless of any social, political, or religious movements or activism.\n\nEdit: Formatting and some last remarks", "subreddit": "ForeverAlone"}

Something that you learn to tolerate on a daily basis, **constantly** dragging this proverbial monkey on your back.\n\n\nIt's no surprise that there's not a lot of success to be had for people suffering from the cancerous disease known as Forever Alone-dom, and I feel like part of that reason is because the term \"success\" is conjecture. Joe down the street may define \"success\" as owning a home and being able to live on his own, meanwhile \"success' may be defined for you simply feeling like you belong in a place that has no room for people like us. \n\n\nA good thing to help you remember what you're striving for is ultimately futile, imagine a pay 2 play video game... For example, Runescape. You can only play so much of the game before they force you to pony up. In the dating world, you simply **exist** as a \"free to play\" guy.

When you are a friendless FA, you have nobody to talk to. You become more lonely and and you cling to anyone who does talk to you. The problem is since you are FA, eventually you vent about being alone because that's what happens to people who are lonely. Ask any non-FA'er who has gone six months without sex or a year without a relationship. It consumes them and they talk about it to their friends. Without friends, we have nobody to talk to that aren't therapists who mostly just have meme advice to offer. \n\n\nWithout friends, we become more toxic to non-FA'ers. Most non-FA'ers don't want to hear a FA talk about being FA. They will become annoyed and ghost on them. They have other friends who are more fun to talk to. That causes the friendless FA'er to once again be alone for an extended period of time. Not having anyone to talk to causes them to develop issues that cause them to be even more toxic to non-FA'ers. A year later another non-FA'er talks to the FA'er and they become acquaintances but the FA'er is so damaged from being a friendless FA'er, even if they try to avoid the subject, it comes out they are FA. The non-FA'er will see them as toxic since they have other friends who are more fun to talk to and ghost the FA'er. It keeps going until years later the friendless FA'er is so emotionally damaged, they will never find anyone to even be friends with because people don't want to be around someone who is so damaged.\n\nThis doesn't even count how being so damaged will make it likely that the friendless FA'er will never be able to have actual relationships unless they get very lucky.", "subreddit": "ForeverAlone"}

When I look at all the women I've ever been attracted to and line them up, I noticed there are patterns that emerge.  Very few women I've been attracted to are not brunette (although I have been attracted to blondes before).  When I was younger, most of them were a bit on the heavier side, although I've noticed recently that recent women I've been attracted to have less of a skew.  Most are asian, white or hispanic, but I think growing up in the bay area has more to do with that than anything else.  The only really weird thing I've noticed is that I am attracted to oddies more than most.  What I mean is that if I run into a cute girl, I generally tend to dismiss more often than not.  But if she's got some weird trait, like a birthmark on her face, scars on her hand, or ears that stick out, being really tall, or some other random thing that is somewhat unusual or abnormal (and that she's probably self-conscious about), I tend to like those things about her - I find them really cute.  The other thing is I really like tom-boyish women, not only because I find the tanktop and jeans look hot but because of their personalities (see below).  But, as before, it doesn't mean I don't like the more feminine girls, it just doesn't happen as often.\n\nPersonality wise, I find most women I am attracted to are the kinds that are unusual or weird, personality-wise.  The last three women whom I found very attractive were either really awkward in a funny way and/or had unusual hobbies that separated them from the basic babes that are so common in the bay area (lol).  I also generally like the tom-boyish women because they tend to not be so sensitive and easily offended (a huge turnoff for me) and tend to have the sarcastic sense of humour that makes it fun to spar with them.\n\nWhat about you?

(OMG this is so long!)", "author": "Fixed_Assets", "self_text": "After seeing so much garbage advice on here, I thought I'd give it a shot.  Keep in mind, this is coming from someoen who is FA so your mileage my vary.\n\nIt is also important to note that following this advice will not guarantee escape - it just improves your chances.  Success is often a function of opportunity meeting skill.  You can't control opportunities - that's mostly luck, but if you can remove the obstacles from your path that would disqualify you from being able to take advantage of an opportunity, your chances of success improve.  Ironically this advice wouldn't help me at all, for reasons I am about to demonstrate.\n\n**1). Identify the specific reasons why you are FA.**\nThis is not as easy as it sounds.  Most people will simply say \"I am FA because I am worthless\" which is unhelpful - that's not a SPECIFIC reason why you are FA.  It is also easy to say \"I am too ugly\" which may be an inaccurate opinion and not an objective analysis (although it is possible to be objectively ugly).  A proper diagnosis is critical at this stage - this is actually where it would be helpful to have a therapist because they generally could help identify problems (but not so much at solving them).\n\nBarring those circumstances, issues typically come in three flavors:\n\n* (a) physical: too overweight, ugly face, too short\n* (b) mental/emotional: autism, social anxiety, clinical depression\n* (c) situational: live in a rural area, live with parents, have no money\n\n**2). Identify solutions that address the problems in Step 1**\nThe biggest issues with meme advice given is that it is either non-specific \"adopt a positive mindset, be more confident, love yourself etc\" that does not address any problem, or worse, it puts a lot of effort into solving problems you don't have.  Asking someone with clinical depression to dress better and get a haircut doesn't solve the depression problem.\n\nWhen evaluating problems for solutions, the following situations will usually come up: \n\n* (a) problem has one or more solutions that require trivial or non-trivial effort.\n* (b) problem has no solutions, but workarounds that make the problem less of a problem are available.\n* (c) problem has no solutions and no workarounds.\n\nFor example, if you are fat, you can lose weight.  It doesn't take a trivial amount of effort, but the problem is solvable.  If you are gay, you can't really fix that, but you could go to a place that has more gay people, thereby working around that particular issue.  Autism doesn't really have a cure, so that problem would fit into the \"c\" category, unfortunately.\n\n**3). Select solutions identified in Step 2**\nKeep in mind that picking a solution isn't as easy as just saying yes - it involves a cost/benefit analysis.  For example, the most common correlations research has found in older male virgins (not FAs exclusively) is an abstinence from alcohol and adherence to strict religious beliefs.  If your family has a history of alcoholism and/or abandoning your strict faith would alienate you from a community you grew up with, selecting these solutions might not be the best way to go about things.  It's fine to say you'd rather not change as long as you own up to the fact that you are choosing something more important to you than the goal of finding someone (or you find other workarounds to this situation - trying to date people in your religious group or going to social events that don't involve alcohol).\n\nThere are also resource constraints to note.  If you have a full time job, joining social groups and meet-ups are more challenging than when you are in school because you have a limited amount of time in the day.  If you are very ugly, plastic surgery might be an effective solution that costs a lot of money and isn't typically covered by insurance (and people have had complications, like dying, from surgery).  The latter case may be a good indicator of a situational problem in Step 2 that would need to be solved first as a DEPENDENCY before going through with the plastic surgery solution.\n\n**4). Plan an execute options selected in Step 3.**\nOnce you decide to start losing weight, you will need to develop habits that will get you to achieve that fix.  This is probably the easiest step because you've already decided what to do about the problem - all that's left to do is the research on how best to approach the solution (youtube and other tutorials online are great for this) and to start doing the work!\n\nSolutions generally tend to go in four phases:\n\n* (a) encouraged and unskilled - you don't know what to do but you are psyched out about getting it done.  This is the \"New Year's Resolution\" phase where you are excited about the end goals.\n* (b) discouraged and unskilled - you've been working at it a while, but you aren't very good at it and/or aren't making much progress yet, and it shows.  Solving problems takes work and you may be discouraged that results are coming along as fast as you had hoped.  This is where most people quit because it's too hard.  Best solution here is to seek encouragement by joining other reddit boards that are dedicated to exactly that.\n* (c) encouraged and proficient - Once you start getting good, you will enjoy solving your problem and enjoying the results of your solution (unless you have other problems to work on and/or your solution doesn't target your problem).\n* (d) discouraged and proficient - At this point, you are so good at what you are doing that you aren't having to think about it at all - it just comes naturally.  But at this point, you are probably already pretty bored with it.  Seeking out new challenges or helping others achieve your goals is often a great way to stay motivated here.\n\nPushing through stage b is probably the most challenging part of adopting new habits, but if you are aware of this truth, it makes it easier to get through it.\n\n**5). Monitor results and counter-indications from action plans in Step 4 and adjust accordingly.**\nSometimes, better solutions come up or what you are doing really isn't solving the problem you mapped it to in step 2 even though you thought it would.  When you are doing something that isn't working, it is a waste of time, money, and effort to keep doing it.  And if you can save time, money, and effort by doing something more efficiently, or get better results by doing it more effectively, you should!\n\nSo there you have it, my 5 step approach.  Here are some examples of how it has (and hasn't) worked for me:\n\n##PROBLEM 1##\n* 1). I have been super shy since I was a kid. As a result, I had no friends and limited experience with social interaction.\n* 2). Possible solutions I identified were basically throwing myself into the cold water by getting a job in retail which would require me to talk to people every day.  I also considered joining academic clubs at school because it would give me the excuse to talk to people on a regular basis about structured activities, rather than trying to come up with stuff to say on my own.\n* 3). Option 1 was a good one because I would get paid for this practice (although not very well, most retail jobs are minimum wage).  Option 2 was also a good one because the barrier to entry is low and there was no financial risk.\n* 4). I elected to take both options 1 and 2 above.  I got a job working at a video store where I learned to both deal with the friendly customers and to get over the anxiety caused by dealing with no so friendly people.\n* 5). Both options worked really well.  Probably too well - people at work have noticed that I now speak too much (lol).  There are still situtations I don't respond well to, like parties and small talk, but those have more to do with a separate problem (aspergers) which I am not going to evaluate here.\n\n##PROBLEM 2##\n* 1). I am perpetually underweight as a result of a genetic illness.  I learned that being 5'8\" and 108lbs is basically a deal-breaker when it comes to being attractive to women.\n* 2). Possible solutions involve lifting+diet to get my weight up and bundling up to obscure how skinny I am.\n* 3). Option 1 is unavailable as medical professionals have told me it hasn't worked historically with people in my condition, and even attempting heavy weight lifting could cause a fatal heart attack.  Option 2 is available and inexpensive since I already have plenty of clothes I could use for this option. However, this is still not particularly effective, since my wrists, neck, and hands are still visible and show how skinny I am.\n* 4). To this day, I bundle up all the time, even when it's hot outside.  I am glad my job mostly involves me working in air-conditioned offices.\n* 5). I acknowledge that my solution is a poor one for escaping FA, but it works \nrelatively well in a professional setting by making me not look too strange.\n\nI should mention that this approach meant I became better professionally but that the deal breakers that separate normals from FAs (aspergers, super-skinny, ugly face and non-masculine voice) are much bigger problems when it comes to dating as opposed to work setting.  And unfortunately, no good solutions or workarounds exist for any of these problems.\n\nSo what do you think?  Does this sound like a reasonable way of solving problems, possibly getting those of you who are late bloomers out of this sub?  Or is it as shitty as the rest?\n\n**TL;DR**: normie advice given here is bullshit because it is non-specific and doesn't do a good job of solving specific problems.  my advice isn't a sure escape-route either, but it will increase the chances that opportunities that you don't control will match up with your personal attributes that you can improve upon.  If you can identify your specific problems that are keeping you FA, identify solutions that address these problems, pick the solutions that don't make you miserable and are financially feasible (and that will actually work), and execute them without getting discouraged, you may be able to come closer to leaving the FA trap.  But this advice won't work for everyone, especially if your problems are deal-breakers that have no good solutions idk.\n\n**update: thanks for the great response, everyone!  Keep in mind, this framework doesn't just work for FA, but for handling all kinds of issues in life.  Next time someone posts MEME advice, just tell them that they can keep their bullshit to themselves because this is the only advice thread we will ever need, and post a link to here. :D**", "subreddit": "ForeverAlone"}

I'm a 22 years old male who feels like I'm failing at life. Objectively, I feel like my life should have been given to someone who would help the world more than I ever could.\n\n In addition, I feel like I'm not worth talking to. Over the years, I've realized that talking to anyone, even my best friends, is a challenge. I find myself going silent in groups, I get anxious with conversations, and my only social interaction happens at work. At the last party I went to, someone came over to me because I looked like I knew nobody there, to which I awkwardly had to admit I knew a majority of people there. When I'm not at work, I'm in my apartment playing video games, and even then I'm too nervous to even join team chat. \n\nThe reason I'm posting this, besides to have it exists somewhere besides my head, is because I've learned a long time ago that while every one of us is unique and we all deserve to be loved and respected, our experiences are rarely unique. I'm sure someone out there may feel similar to what I described, and I'm inviting you, if you feel lonely, to talk to me. I may not be good at conversing, but I'm a good reader/listener. If you want to get something off your chest, shoot me a message or comment. Or maybe you just want to talk casually. Teach me about music, movies, art, history, whatever you want. I really hope I can respond to anyone who reaches out regardless of age, gender, or religion, I promise I'll try and I won't ask for any personal information, so let's try our best to be just 1% less lonely. \n\nEdit: Just adding, I'm not a health care professional and am in no way a substitute for one.

{"post_id": "akjk9t", "created_utc": 1548647511, "title": "They Chose Me Because....", "author": "Chelicerae44", "self_text": "They Chose Me Because.....\n\n1. They had no other choices and felt that they needed to \"settle\" for me instead of dealing with being alone. So they use me as a place holder, until they find someone better and dump me. They might even leave me alone one day, because they grew tired of settling for me. Or they bite off more than they can chew by keeping me around for their own convenience and give the other person all their love or friendship instead of me. \n\n2. They chose me out of pity. They felt so bad about my appearance or life experiences that they didn't want to look bad by rejecting me. Hence I only receive manufactured affection and pity sex. They end up resenting me despite the fact that they could have chosen to reject me in the first place instead of lying to me. \n\n3. They chose me because they didn't want anyone to suspect that they were gay. So I become what's known as a \"beard\" so that the woman/man can prove that they're straight to their friends/family/community. \n\n4. They chose me because they wanted to prank me/they lost a bet/or felt peer pressured into doing a dare. The loser might even be pressured to ask me out/take me on a date/date me/have sex with me, for the amusement of their friends.\n\n\n5. They lost their significant other due to a breakup/divorce/death and are in desperate need to be in a romantic relationship again in order to get their old life back. So they chose whoever can play the role as spouse/significant other. If you so much as try to be as good as their former lover, they will accuse you of trying to \"erase\" their lover. Despite the fact that they chose you to end the pain of losing their loved one.\n\n6. They wanted me to be a \"project\" of theirs, so that they could see if they could change me. They see my life choices and opinions as a challenge to see how far they can pressure me to agree to their standards. \"I see something in you that no one else sees.\" Or \"You'd have so much potential if you started doing____ instead of doing_____\" are their favorite pickup lines. They will sometimes go as far as to \"fix\" me to their standards so that they can pat themselves on the back for heroically taking me in and \"fixing me\". They think that they're so special because they \"sacrificed\" their chances at getting a decent partner to \"rescue\" you. When you are fixed to their standards or become a finished project, they will leave you to go fix someone else, forcing you to try to win them back. If you do fall back on your \"progress\", they will take you back and scold you for not upholding their standards. If they do stay, they'll be quick to remind you about how they \"fixed\" you and that you should be thankful for their efforts, every time you make a mistake or try to call them out on their bad habit/behavior. \n\n\n7. They chose me because my appearance and flaws make them look more attractive if they are next to me. They need someone less \"beautiful, smart, thin, ect\" to be their punching bag and to compare themselves to so that they can boost their ego and validate their opinions about themselves. \n\n8. They chose me because they needed to brag about how they're the friend/SO/fianc\u00e9/spouse of me just to boost their ego. This would only happen if you were famous, rich or in a high position of power. \n\n\n9. They chose me because I have something that they want but they're too cowardly and selfish to ask me or receive the \"something\" in an honest way. Be it money, fame, or power to inhance their social status. Example 1: Military wives who are really Dependapotomus and Tricaretops. Example 2: People suddenly trying to be your best friend when you get a big lottery win/inheritance/legal settlement. \n\n\n10. They chose me because they assumed that I was \"easy\" and \"desperate\" because of my appearance and that I should be grateful for any attention that I receive. Especially in the case of sexual harassment and rape. They grow angry when I reject their attentions because I deny them the opportunity to abuse me. \n\n\n11. They chose me because they needed to feel powerful and I happen to be a convenient target for rape/sexual harassment/domestic violence/bullying/racism/hate crime. \n\n\n12. They chose me because they needed yet another person to pay attention to them to satiate their ego. In other words, gather a crowd of worshippers to boost their ego. They are popular with nearly everyone in their school/country/workplace/church/town/community. Be it because they're rich/famous/politically powerful/sexually attractive/talented/generous/ect. These kinds of people will never be satisfied with the amount of attention you give them. They will simply move on from you once you stop chasing them or become uninteresting. Or they'll accuse you of \"not caring about them\" once you stop giving them attention or fail to give enough attention. Plus they're so busy being popular with everyone that they fail to notice what people truly think of them. They never notice that all of their followers are really just there to get money/fame/power/sex from them and aren't really their friends. Plus, a good chunk of their so-called friends are really jealous of them and their reputation. Hence, you need to steer clear from popular people. \n\n13. They chose me so that I could play housewife and bear children for them because they needed to continue their bloodline. If I fail to give them children (especially sons) or grow too old to bear anymore children, then I am useless to them. They then replace me with a younger and hotter wife to give them more children. \n\n14. They chose me because they like to troll and lead on ugly people. They tell you that \"they truly love you\" and that \"they'll be with you no matter what\". When they get bored of lying and trolling you, they break you heart because they get such a rush and immense pleasure from being so manipulative. \n\n15. They chose me because I happen to be sexual fetish material to them. They don't care how I feel about their fetish or how it will affect me. They don't love me and end up resenting me for having ideas/opinions and pushing away from their sexual fetish, instead of being the mindless fuck toy that they wanted. Example: Someone with \"jungle fever\" or having a fetish for Asian girls because they're \"supposed to be cute and subservient\".\n\n16. They chose me because they are sex addicts and will fuck anything with (or without) a pulse. They will tell you that you're beautiful or handsome just to pacify you into laying with them. They will get bored of you and move on to their next target. They intentionally have sex with ugly or unattractive people. All under the guise of \"boosting the ugly person's confidence and making them feel wanted\". When they're really trying to sleep with as many men/women as possible and have as many men/women, obsess over them. They also get pats on the back for \"taking one for the team\" when none of their friends want to date the ugly person. \n\n17. They chose me because they wanted to feel special by having more than one girl/boy fall in love with them. They especially enjoy it when they are able to incite violence between two girls/boys and have them fight for their attention. \n\n18. The chose me for the novelty of dating a [insert race/ethnicity/nationality]. Once the novelty wears off, they'll get bored. After all, these people are on a sexual conquest to fuck as many white/black/Latino/Asian/indigenous people as possible. \n\n19. They chose me for my [insert disability/disease/occupation] so that they can look like a hero to other people. Example 1: Someone dating a person with terminal cancer so that they can look heroic for taking in that person instead of a \"functional one\". Example 2: Someone choosing a rape victim so that they can get credit for being the man/woman that helped \"fix\" the \"broken\" man/woman. Example 3: Someone choosing a disabled veteran so that they can look good and get their benefits. Example 4: Someone taking a person with Down's Syndrome to prom or a date in order to look \"altruistic\". \n\n20. They chose me because society told them that they were running out of time to fulfill the getting sex/engaged/married/having children with partner \"milestone\". So they decided to \"settle\" with me because achieving the life script is better late than never. Example 1: Someone marrying you just so that they have an excuse to have a wedding party and be a bride/groom for a day. Example 2: Someone tampering with your birth control (poking holes in condoms or diaphragm/ stealing your pills) so that you'll be forced to have children with them. \n\n21. They chose me because they wanted to get ahead in their career or status. They give you promises of not only sex and love but to \"help further your career/status\" and that they'll \"share the spoils of our victory\". Just so that you would be willing to do anything to help them get further up the totem pole by helping them with cheating/bribery/embezzlement/nepotism. Once you do what's needed, they step on you to get to the top and drag your name through the mud in order to discredit you when you point out what you did to help them get illegally promoted/elected/hired/nominated. \n\n22. They were simply drunk/high when they chose you. Otherwise they wouldn't have if they were sober.\n\n23. They chose me because they needed members for their cult. They will \"forgive\" you for your shortcomings in exchange for allowing them to mentally and physically abuse you into being indoctrinated into their cult. Example: Scientology/Islam/Judaism/Christianity.\n\n24. They chose me because they needed members for their gang/crime syndicate/cartel/terrorist group. They will \"forgive\" you for your shortcomings in exchange for allowing them to mentally and physically abuse you into being indoctrinated into their group. Examples: ISIS, Taliban, Los Zetas, MS-13, Aryan Brotherhood, Neo-Nazis, Ku Klux Klan, Yakuza, Crips and Bloods. \n\n25. They chose me because they want to purify their race/spread their religion and make more children in order to outnumber \"undesirable people\". Examples: Nazism, Quiverfull Movement, Mormonism, Islam, Christianity, Judaism. \n\n.....But either way, they didn't chose me, for *me*. ", "subreddit": "ForeverAlone"}

As a matter of fact, I believe I've committed the horrible sin of making sex my goal in life. Obviously setting myself up for failure, but in hindsight it seems like the thing I've been doing subconsciously up until this point in time has really fucked up my relationships in the past and opportunities I could have had to have legitimate, lasting relationships with people slipped through my fingers because of this. \n\n\n\n\n\nThe fact that I made porn and the desire for sex my god seems like it's undermined all the other facets in my life. Regardless of how easy it is to blame porn for all my problems, I'll never forget all the people I used to talk to from school. They weren't friends by any means, but we shared a few words in between me getting my ass kicked by every upper classman and their mothers. But... that's another rant for another night when I'm not nice and loopy from being tired and angry. I'd talk to them before this... *plague*... Entered my life. Not **once** would I sexualize a conversation or look at a girl in a dirty way. I suppose that was both a good and bad thing, but it wasn't until I opened that can of worms that I realized there was a dark, decaying hand that popped out, dragging me deeper down the rabbit hole until I realized I'm officially no longer even **interested** in dating anymore.\n\n\nWhy would I be?\n\n\nI've seen the naked flesh of a woman before - I'd know what to expect if I, say, paid a girl to take her clothes off for me (That'd probably be the only way she'd agree, to be honest). I know there's supposedly this underlying \"fulfillment\" that can come from being in a relationShit^TM, but it almost all seems moot at this point, like I'd be wasting my time while **not** mentally preparing myself for this life of celibacy\n\n\n\n\n\n**TL;DR**: Sal thought he could have sex, so he looked up porn to see what he was getting himself into.

It's because I'm not normal. I'm literally just not like relatively healthy, happy people. There's a deep disconnect that's based on the most elemental factors imaginable. \n\nMost people don't hate themselves or humankind in general. Most people have balance in their lives, within and without. Give and take, push and pull. Most people, no matter how loving their hearts are, inevitably recoil at the ceaselessly depressive, at the relentlessly hopeless. People who have hopes and dreams and plans that seem achievable cannot relate to those who are lost and directionless and filled with sadness and fear. It's really a minor miracle that I even got to experience the brief flights of fancy that I did. I'll never know quite how I managed to trick two incredible women into slumming with me.\n\nIn a strange, sad way, realizing this is some grave comfort. I can stop torturing myself over what it is about me I should change so that things will change and someone will love me. The reality is that there's really no way to be anything different -- or better, or more -- than what I am. And what I am is basically nothing, at least in the context of, you know, the world.

She never explicitly said \"I want to talk to you\", that is true. She never said that, but when I asked for her number I got it and when I texted her she texted me back; however, she never did say she wanted to talk to me actually. So whether she was just bored that day specifically and needed a distraction or whether she found me over time to be lacking, I'm not sure. Regardless of that, reading those words broke me in a different way.\n\nI've been rejected, turned down, lied to, and even made fun of but yesterday was different. Yesterday something like a switch flipped in me and it hasn't came back on. I've been at this for 8 years and for the last year very very seriously (religiously going to the gym, eating better, losing 20lbs, wearing better clothes, etc). Yesterday cancelled all of that out and no I'm not saying all of those things were in vain but to think that the culmination of all those things together did me no good and I'm still in the same exact pit as ever is disheartening to say the least about it as possible. All of those things have improved me a little bit, mind and body wise, but all of that stuff is immediately cancelled out once someone is dead in your face bluntly telling you that you're not good enough for them, their time, or attention. For someone to just sit there, pick you up, look you over once or twice like an antique at the thrift shop only to put you right back among all of the other forgotten things that maybe one day might pique someone's specific interest. \n\nIt's a really damaging feeling and the only thing I could possibly relate it to is being like the last unwanted orphan in the orphanage. All of the other kids are getting picked up, even the ones you thought were as weird as you and would never be placed in a home before you. Everyone's being chosen around you but you, and you have no idea why. You have no idea why it's you that's so unlovable. You have no idea what your defect is, you just keep guessing at what's faulty inside of you. And the thing is you have no guide with which to compare yourself to normal or \"good enough\", but you desperately want to be good enough for anyone, for someone. So you just keep slashing away at any and every piece of you that you think is unsavory to those you're trying to win over. Eventually that leaves you voided and less than half the person you used to be. As much as you've tried to improve yourself, you've nothing to show for it at all, you're just empty. All of the hard work and determination was really for nothing. You gave it 110% and this experience took that 110% and it gave nothing back. It just takes every bit of strength you have and continuously demands more until you can't even stand on your own two feet.\n\nTL;DR you can be determined as ever, work your ass off to escape, and still end up with nothing because at the end of the day someone just has to accept you.\n\nEdit: this post didn't really have a point, more or less a long soap box ramble that I wasn't about to scrap", "subreddit": "ForeverAlone"}

YOU GOTTA TRY IT!!!\" \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEver hear something like this from a friend or coworker or whatever? Maybe it's a burger joint, or a roller coaster, or a new app for your phone. Somebody talks something up like crazy, and you're inclination is to want to try it. If a lot of people are talking about how amazing that guacamole is, now you kind of have to try it. Just to know what they're talking about. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWell this certainly isn't limited to tacos and traffic apps. It applies to relationships too. Our entire lives, movies, books, TV, commercials, as well as every other person and their grandma has told us just how incredibly amazing relationships can be. How it enhances your life so much, and can make you weep with joy. \"Seriously. Your life will just not be complete without one. You  Gotta try it!!!\" \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOkay. I'm definitely interested in one. When I get off work, I think I'll head on over to the girlfriend-store. Pick one out, bring her up to the cashier, get the extended warranty, the whole deal. This will be great! Everyone says so!!!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBut not so fast. There's no such thing as a girlfriend store. Getting a girlfriend is going to be a bit tougher than getting some guacamole. I'm going to have to be charming, or sexy, or interesting, or super humorous. My awkwardness will also repel them. And that deep desire I now have will dramatically hinder my chances. They can smell my desperation under the layers of humor I try and wrap it under. The interactions I've had with them have made it pretty clear: they are just not interested me. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWell that sucks. Everyone I know is experiencing what is apparently the most wonderful thing in the history of ever. But some personality defects in me keep me from experiencing that. Everyone else at the table has their guacamole, but I don't cause I didn't ask for it correctly...or something. Hell I don't know. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhatever. I can live without. I still get sad a lot, but I don't take it out on others. (At least, I hope I don't). Nobody ever said life was fair. There are kids in Africa being born with AIDS. My little problem is kind of petty compared to that. I'm an adult living a fairly comfortable life. All in all, I don't have much too complain about really. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBut I still have this desire. And I don't think I can just will it away or anything. I can try to ignore it. But unless I live the life of a complete hermit, eventually I'll hear someone say \"My SO is just the best thing ever!! I love them so much!! Hey, you should get yourself a girlfriend!  Your life will be so much better!\" So now that desire has been reinforced. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo when I see someone on an advice forums or something say, \"Stop putting so much emphasis on relationships\", it's not just me doing that.

He has never been shy to show PDA and because they both drank a little they were all over each other the whole night. At first, they weren't and I was fine but as soon as I saw her sit on his lap, it ruined the whole rest of the night for me.\n\nThis is the kind of thing that's been happening since around Thanksgiving time to me. My psyche is so destroyed as soon as I see one instance of someone having something I've never had. It can be anyone, any place, anytime.\n\nI can't focus on anything, I feel like just sleeping all day and while on that topic, I'm often tired as hell because my mind races at night. I've got other problems on top of this and the weight is just so heavy right now.\n\nI can say with 100% certainty that I would never harm myself but I'm really concerned because I don't feel like myself anymore. I truly feel subhuman. I've just been so deprived for so long that I'm afraid if it ever does happen, I would have a heart attack or something from the ecstasy.\n\nThis sucks so much guys. How any of us can make it through a day is so commendable. Thanks everyone for being here for support because not even my closest friends and family can relate.", "subreddit": "ForeverAlone"}

If, only, you could see...", "author": "T-Metrics", "self_text": "World,\n\nHow appalling, this is, that I am saying these words; That I have to renounce you and your culture. You and I couldn't be Kin, during this lifetime. We couldn't be one with each other.\n\nI know that I am different than the others, but are my differences so worthy of the isolation and avoidance that you put forth, just to not have to ask about why I am the way that I am, or why I act and think the way that I do? I know that I am different. I am, fundamentally, different, in such a way that you will never understand, or be willing to accept. Perhaps, that is why you cast me to the shadows. You cannot and will not accept me for my differences - The very differences that are a core part of my being, and that I cannot and will not change. It is what makes me, me.\n\nI understand what makes you and your societies tick, now. I know what drives you to do the things that you do, and why you think the way that you do. And, knowing this, I fear for my well-being. I fear of the barbarism of your culture, and the primitive notions that drive you to perpetuate a false system, and a false way of life. I fear for my own well being and sanity, but I, also, fear for your future, as a living species. Call it a stereotype, but unless you change your ways, and shed the need for these false institutions and false economies, then you will, surely, perish. Just, another one of nature's failed experiments.\n\n...I can't guarantee any degree of future, while I am among you, sadly. This is why I am telling you that which I wish that you would see. The more astute of you will have, no doubt, picked up on my differences, and put two and two together. I make no attempt to veil my actions and intentions. I do not hide, behind walls and false flags, like you do. I come, as I am, and my words, actions and intentions speak no degree of subtle language. I am who I am, and I am what I am.\n\nI am among you, for a time, as one of you. You see me on the street, and in your grocery stores. I eat at your restaurants, and I repair your broken electronics. I walk, among you, as plainly as I am, and I make no attempt to hide myself from you. Perhaps, that is why keep your distance, from me. You know that I am different, but you don't know what makes me different. You may wish to ask me, but fear offending me, out of virtue of your culture's propensity for political correctness. Maybe, you see all of the signs, but are too afraid to approach me, to ask the question. Well, my American brethren, for whom I must watch destroy themselves, each day... Allow me to bring clarity to your suspicions.\n\nI'm not, actually, one of you. I never have been. I was reborn of your flesh, almost thirty two years ago, but I am not of your origin. I come from another time, and another place, and if you were to look into what makes me tick, then you would see that I am, still, an otherworldly being - The same otherworldly being that I, once, was; Only, now, continued as a human being. I look like you, but I am not one of you.\n\nPerhaps, it was the differences in my psychology, and the ability for me to experience emotional ranges that you can't, as well as advanced forms of some of your own emotions, that led us to be so astray from each other. I can understand how that would create a rift, but we are, still, of the same flesh. By all respects, we are supposed to be Kin. We should be one with each other, instead of tearing each other apart with false systems that prey on people's petty differences. \n\nIf it helps, human beings, then you would do well to know that you experience emotional ranges that I am incapable of experiencing, and that your psychology is not like mine. Perhaps, that is why we could not be Kin. I am a Xeno-Human, yes, but should my differences be what casts me into the pits of loneliness and despair? I thought that America was supposed to be a land that embraces people's differences, and that strives for a diverse mosaic of human potential. I guess, in the end, that we weren't meant to be. We could not be Kin with each other, and I could not be one of you. I have shown you who I am, and I have accepted you for who you are. Why will you not accept me? Why must I be relegated to the outside?\n\n...I've, about, completed my purpose for being alive, on earth, as a human being. I have, only, a handful of tasks left, before I can await my end to strike me down. I have no desire to engage in your culture or way of life, anymore. Too much time and isolation has passed, for me to be able to integrate into your society. I would be unable to function with you. You've made your position clear, human beings. You have no room for an Alien in your world. I understand your decision. It's a petty and inferior choice, but I understand that I have no place. I thought that America was supposed to be the land of opportunity. I guess that that was a lie, too...\n\nI'm going to rebuild my old dwelling unit, from before I was a human being. If I cannot take solace in your world, then I will retreat to my old life. You may have denied me of my humanity, but you cannot take away my extra-terrestriality. If I cannot be a human being, with you, then I will return to being an extra-terrestrial being. I will live in my prior living environment, and live my old life. When nature determines that I've lived enough of my life, then I will die as an old Alien, in my bed, in my proper environment. Then, when nature reincarnates me as a new form, you can rest assured knowing that I won't be showing myself on earth, again. I, already, know what I will be recycled to somewhere else, as a something else. I am incompatible with you.\n\nIt is a shame, that it has to be like this. I've long-suspected that I wasn't, actually, a human being, but it wasn't until my re-awakening that I was made aware of my roots. I've been socially isolated for most of my human life, but over the course of these last six years, my apartment has become my chrysalis, and I have been the metamorphosing caterpillar. Between my thirteen years of spiritual experiences, and my spiritual awakening, I will never be able to live a normal life with any of you. With the wisdom and perspectives that I carry, I fear for all of creation, in light of what you are capable of.\n\nI understand that your ways drive you to seek the acceptance of a higher power, but take it from an Alien... You are not a species that is worthy of its god's love. You are, eternally, doomed to failure and repetition of your past, until you can accept that you are no different from each other, and that you need to put others before yourself. Sadly, I do not think that you will, ever, learn that lesson. That is why you are doomed to fail. That is why I am not like you. That is why we could not be Kin.\n\nI do wish that I could have some form of solace to take in you. However, it seems that my human reality is one of withering hope. I am to rebuild my prior dwelling, and die in it, alone. Perhaps, then, I can bring closure to my last life. I wanted this life to be filled with happy memories and many smiles, but it seems that humanity is too dark and barbaric to comprehend a higher way of life. I wish that I had nice things to say about you, humanity. Sadly, I don't.\n\nI look forward to my next life. Given, the work that I've done in this life, I can look forward to a more-pleasant form, as well as a better culture. I would, still, share my time with you, humanity. You may have shut me out, but my door is open for you. Surely, there must be someone of your ranks that is above and beyond the need for this primitive behavior? You can't, all, be like this... Can you?\n\nCan you?... I await any willing member of the species that wishes to put our differences aside, and embrace what bring us together.\n\nUntil then\n\n\\- R\\`e'shae\\`a \"Rae\"\n\n(Reh-shay-uh \"Ray\")", "subreddit": "lonely"}

Like any other terminal disease out there (please, don't get me wrong; I've lost 70% of my family to such conditions and currently going through the seventh time of this bullshit, and I haven't even hit the 23 yo mark yet- I do GENUINELY believe loneliness will be the one thing that kills me, and I don't even think losing people to Death\u2122 every other month or so is even the main reason for it). \n\nI don't know, this subreddit just sounded like literally The Place to mumble about something like this? Sorry. \n\nI'm just tired of being alone. \n\nHow do y'all deal with it? I mean, I am a bit dumb, but I'd like to give myself some credit and state that I don't believe I'm THAT much of a moron- I just honestly can't deal with it anymore because I merely don't even know how to approach such an issue anymore, srsly.  I've tried reaching out, getting help, but it's gotten so bad that, when eventually it IS given to me that glorious opportunity that I find 'crying like a son of a bitch' to be, I can only do it locked up somewhere deserted and being all by myself. None of them expected 'whole heartdly felt' hugs, no comfort words, no solemn, silence shoulder by my side to cry on.

As time has gone on I've been getting more and more depressed day by day and I don't really know the way to remedy that but I suppose that kind of the point. Now I kind of figured out what I want to do with my life I just need to put that plan into action and put in my application and is giving me a lot of time to reflect on I might go wrong what might happen but it's something that I've got to do in my eyes hopefully I'll make friends in this occupation.\n\n I've got a lot of time I will be ready to do the fitness examination. its kind of left me in a pit of loneliness and I don't really know how to get out, I thought posting on here might help a bit but I don't know what I'm expecting to be honest as I've never really opened up to anybody that might be\nthe reason why my friends have left me I don't know, the sad thing is that i feel myself getting more cold the more time I'm alone. I don't think I can change that easily. I think I need someone to show me how to let my feeling out and even care again, how do I do that when I don't know how to talk to people (I want to talk to people but when I try to talk to someone I don't know how to move the conversation forward)\n", "subreddit": "lonely"}

I thought I\u2019d give an update with some interesting news.\n\nFirst off, I can\u2019t believe it\u2019s been over 500 days since I posted my first log on this sub. I still remember that pivotal moment when I said \u201cscrew it\u201d and decided to make a change. A change to my health, appearance, and social life.\n\nThe level of progress I made in 2018 was absolutely incredible. It hasn\u2019t been easy though, and I\u2019ve had some very tough times too. Things relating to mental health and self-confidence but we\u2019ll get to that later in this post.\n\nIn the beginning of 2018, it was Spring semester and I was focusing a lot of my time on studies and the gym. I was super crazy into fitness and gained nearly 20 pounds of mass. This raised my self-confidence to an unprecedented level. I was actually comfortable wearing t-shirts. People noticed a difference. I felt so good about the progress I had made and physical strength I had acquired. I was incredibly grateful for the friends that got me into fitness and worked out with me.\n\nCome summer time, I was working on some fun pet-projects of mine and working out at night. More importantly, I started talking to a girl, and for the first time, I had hit it off with someone. We kept in touch quite frequently over text and I wasn't all that nervous. It felt natural. I mentioned in my earlier posts on this sub that even looking at a girl used to make me blush and raise my heartbeat.\n\nWe went to different schools and before Fall semester started, I asked if she\u2019d like to meet up. She said yes and I was excited and nervous at the same time. We made plans to meet up early in the semester over text and Skype. A couple weeks later, we had our first date.\n\nDriving up to her place, I was so nervous. My heart was pounding when Google Maps said I was 5 minutes from my destination. She was smiling at me when I drove up. As someone who has never felt wanted, this was unreal.\n\nWe had an awesome weekend-long date. I wasn\u2019t afraid to initiate touch. As pathetic as it sounds, being hugged by a non-family member who wanted to see me was surreal. I had so much fun spending time with her. Even little things like shopping for groceries or waiting in line for food was an experience. I felt so incredibly normal and thought \u201cwow this is what I\u2019ve been missing out on every time I saw a couple out in public.\u201d\n\nTo the average person with average dating-experience, this probably wouldn\u2019t have been a huge deal. I\u2019m sure you guys would understand though. Regardless, we both enjoyed the date and agreed on another one.\n\nI\u2019ll be blunt, I got pretty emotional on the drive back to my place. I think that was the first time I cried tears of joy. Mainly it was hope. For the first time, I had experienced what I had been missing out on. I felt like my presence wasn\u2019t a burden and knowing that I was able to make someone happy by spending time with them was surreal.\n\nWe kept in touch nearly everyday through texting. Also Skyped for hours on end. The distance was too much during the semester, so it wasn\u2019t until holiday break when we had our second date. It was awesome.\n\nDuring the time in between the first and second date, I had a lot of self-doubt. Although we kept in touch and our communication didn\u2019t fizzle, I always questioned whether she would still want to see me again.\n\nI had suspected depression long before I started talking to this girl, and was diagnosed in December. It took me three years to finally talk to someone about it. Basically, it was an incredibly rough Fall season for me filled with self-doubt and low-confidence. I had an extremely low appetite, I cried nearly everyday, I overslept, and I contemplated suicide. I had some of these symptoms for a while but they kept getting worse as college progressed.\n\nI think a lot of it was in my head. When I picked her up on the second date, she looked at me the same way as before. She was elated to see me and felt way more comfortable this time (our first date was a little awkward at first). At that moment, it was apparent that all that self-doubt was in my head. I had blamed myself instead of the long-distance.\n\nWe agreed to a third date if our schedules matched. Now that this semester has started, we\u2019re unsure whether we\u2019ll be able to officially date. Schedules are even more hectic than last semester, but there might be an opportunity during the Summer since we\u2019ll both be back home from college. It sucks but I am so happy that it happened.\n\nThe main point here is that I had experienced something new for the first time. I wouldn\u2019t have never seen this coming two years ago. It\u2019s that unreal to me. My friends are surprised.\n\nThis new friendship and dating experience has shed some light that people do like me and I am capable of going out on dates. Most importantly, it showed that I was capable of forming a connection with someone (beyond just guy friends that I\u2019m very close with).\n\nAs for this year, I\u2019ve kicked off the semester by getting out of my room on the weekends. One of my closest friends knows about my depression and has been incredibly supportive. I\u2019m almost tearing up writing this and how grateful I am for him. Essentially, I\u2019m not isolating myself in my room like my high school years. And when I do go out, the idea of finding a girlfriend isn\u2019t on my mind. I'm present and having fun.\n\nBeing diagnosed with major depressive disorder was very eye-opening. It was a relief finally getting help. I\u2019m doing much better than I was a month ago. I still have some bad days, but all in all, it\u2019s much better.\n\nOkay so for the million dollar question. Have I escaped FA? Technically I don\u2019t have a girlfriend. But I\u2019ve made so much personal progress that it seems unreal. Sometimes I have to take a step back and look at the big picture.\n\nFor the first time, I was capable of connecting with a girl I liked. I wasn\u2019t afraid of telling her my feelings. I enjoyed spending time with her. I wasn't my previously nervous, awkward self.\n\nWhen I started making these posts some 500 days ago, I wouldn\u2019t have seen myself where I am today. Sure, I had expected to make some amount progress when I wrote that first entry, but it\u2019s weird when it actually happens.\n\nHere\u2019s to 2019.\n\nTL;DR - Kept up with physical health, finally reached out for help with mental health, and got to know a girl and went out on a second date for the first time.", "subreddit": "ForeverAlone"}

I'm average looking, neurotypical, and not physically handicapped.  That being said, I realized around the end of high school what being FA  meant and saw that if I didn't try my hardest to escape it while I  could, it would be much harder to do so later. So starting around  October 2016 (my purchase date for Dale Carnegie's How to Win Friends  and Influence People). I tried to consume and act on as much information  as possible, browsing subreddits, watching youtube videos, and asking  people out just because I thought they would say yes. I spent a year  doing this and got about 2 dates. Not amazing but it was progress.\n\nThen  college started. It felt like everybody around me was getting involved  in relationships, and I could feel the countdown timer to graduation  immediately start to tick, so I abandoned so many things that I used to  love just because I felt that they held me back. I played less  video-games in a week than I used to in a day, I stopped watching anime,  I limited my time on reddit, I sold my D&amp;D books, and I even took  some guidance from some morally questionable pill related subreddits. I  replaced my old hobbies with listening to music, reading, audio-books,  podcasts, going to the gym, etc. Escaping FA became my number 1 priority  in life, even surpassing academics as I only saw getting my degree as a  long term escape plan since having money helps your chances.\n\nI  had limited success for a while (never a 2nd date) and then came last  winter break. I indulged in all of the habits that used to keep me down,  I stopped going to the gym, I stopped reading, stopped listening to  audio-books, I basically did a complete 180 on all of the  self-improvement stuff, as far as the \"get interesting hobbies\" side  goes. Then when school started, I started asking lots of people out and  escaped FA 2 weeks later when I met someone who was also interested in  me. They were far out of my league and honestly if I had gotten a proper  look at their face I would not have sat down next to them.\n\nDuring  my date with that person, the way they reacted to the conversation  topics that I brought up made me realize that all of the \"make yourself  an interesting person\" talk was nothing but drivel. When I brought up  stories from audiobooks/podcasts I listened to, they were disinterested.  When I brought up music, they had different taste. When they brought up  video-games, I steered the conversation away from that with the only  information I let them get being that I also own a PS4. What mattered  the most was everything that I had learned which was SPECIFIC to dating  and socializing, and not just making yourself a better person. How to  ask good questions, how to make someone feel emotional about things,  what to talk about, what not to talk about, what to wear, etc. I could  have bought a switch and binged for the past year and it wouldn't have  made a difference. The scars of being FA are still on me as I feel  horrible when I see couples walking around and can't stand romance in  any of the media I consume, plus I don't expect anything long term with  this person, but having the ability to succeed even once is good enough  for me.\n\nMy  main points are that making yourself into a better person doesn't make  you more attractive, making yourself more physically attractive and  learning skills specific to dating are 5x more important (at least at  the initial stages). I got the idea to make this post after watching  videos by Monday FA Monday ( [https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCTqKAe\\_hNq-kFp1ss6Lga6g/videos](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCTqKAe_hNq-kFp1ss6Lga6g/videos)  ) and in one of his videos I heard him mention that all of the skills  FAs are told to improve are useless in terms of what actually produces  results, and I wanted to both reaffirm that and spread his wisdom.\n\ntl;dr  Self-improvement as far as being more cultured and having interesting  hobbies isn't all that useful, making yourself more physically  attractive and practicing skills specific to dating like socializing,  teasing, how to touch someone, etc. are a better use of your time, as  well as just number of people you approach.\n\nRepost due to automod removing post.", "subreddit": "ForeverAlone"}

I am able to get a few dates a year via online dating but I realize I am up against the other guys she is probably talking to and even if thing go great if there is no chemistry there is nothing I can do.

It all started towards the end of 2017 when I told a guy, that I really liked, that I  liked him for the first time.And he didn\u2019t return my feelings. I feel like I have a fun personality and am kind, so I\u2019m assuming it must\u2019ve been my looks. I\u2019m not the  physically conventional beauty that guys want.I mean it must be.

Most of the women in my family had experience in dating before they were 20, and I\u2019m almost 21. I even posted myself on rateme( stupid I know), on a throwaway account,and they sure did a good job of proving to me that I\u2019m not the girl who gets that sort of attention from men.

My stress levels are off the charts and I can't even tell how scared I am. I've been crying and having panic attacks almost every day of 2019.

All I do is go to school, come home, do homework if I have any, play video games, watch Netflix blah blah. Basically it\u2019s impossible to make friends at community college. Every ones to class and goes straight home to work. I\u2019ve seen some  very attractive girls, but they\u2019re all out of my league. I don\u2019t if I\u2019m living in the wrong place at the wrong time, but I feel so out of place. I never really connected with anyone in high school, and community college is just a repeat of that. At least in high school, there was football games on Friday nights, which I rarely went to, but it gave me something to do. I see all the pictures on Instagram and Facebook and see the people I went to high school having the time of their lives and meeting new people; I see the beautiful girls that are at universities and it\u2019s just fucked. \n\nAnother thing. So my family went out to eat with my brother and his girlfriend along with her family(who we\u2019ve never met before) and some how her sister got to talking about friends and she asked me if I had met any good friends at college. And I just didn\u2019t know what to say, so my sister had to step in and speak for me by saying, \u201coh community college is a commuter school and there\u2019s a lot of older non-traditional students. So a lot of people just go to class and go home.\u201d \nThis was probably the most embarrassing thing that\u2019s happened to me in recent memory. I didn\u2019t have the balls to say I had no friends, because I\u2019ve never really thought about it until know. This hurt me so much. No one should have to attempt to someone who didn\u2019t even really know that you don\u2019t have friends.

Anyway, here we go. \n\nI guess I\u2019ll start a few years back. My wife and I bought our first house after saving for a few years. It was a little more than we should have bought but if we kept saving and being smart we would always be fine. Well we weren\u2019t always smart. She kept buying things to put into the house even though I told her we should take our time doing that. So over the next few years this continued, we had a child, I lost my job and we were in debt. When we found out we were pregnant I told her we should sell our house and move. We couldn\u2019t afford it and the area we lived in was a hard place to make a living. She refused so I cut everything in our budget that wasn\u2019t necessary. We were barely making it. \n\nAbout two years later I lost my job. Now it was really time to move. Again, she flat out refused. She would always tell me we would be homeless if we sold it and yes that makes no sense. So now our credit card is maxed out, we are barely making enough to pay our bills and on top of that both of our vehicles were getting pretty old and starting to cause problems. Same with our house. It was nice but was now 12 years old. Things were in need of repair. A family member of mine found out what was happening and despite my refusing, they paid off our debt. She still wouldn\u2019t leave the house. \n\nFast forward another year. She\u2019s gotten involved in an mlm company despite me being against it (we were desperate for money) and I\u2019m working again but it\u2019s only part time and our debt is rising. There\u2019s no reasoning with her about moving. It\u2019s like she was paralyzed by fear and couldn\u2019t make a rational decision. So things are pretty bad and come Christmas time, we have a huge fight. She had been asking me to go to couples therapy off and on for a while and I always refused. I thought if we could both just try harder then things would get back to the way we were. Well she never tried. In fact she got worse. She got so hung up on Internet likes and comments from strangers that nothing I did or said made an impact on her anymore. So after this big fight I finally realized that I was not going to get through to her and agreed to the therapy. \n\nSo we start seeing someone who was highly recommended to us. We go a few times together and a few times alone (at the request of the therapist) but things aren\u2019t getting better. In fact, she\u2019s getting even worse. She\u2019s becoming more distant, lazy and apathetic. She wouldn\u2019t even clean up after herself so our house looked like a hoarders paradise. She would complain that she needed help but would become angry when I tried to help. It was like I was living with Jekyll and Hyde. \n\nDespite all of this, I still felt like the woman I married was in there and I still loved her. Plus our son is amazing, was pretty oblivious to everything going on and I love him to death. Then, about 10 months ago, I come home from work one day and find that no one is home which is strange for that time of day. I look around for a few minutes and put up the food (she had asked me to bring a few things home for dinner) and then I see a note taped to the tv. It was a letter from a collection agency about our credit card debt and she had written \u201cfigure this out, we\u2019ll be at my moms\u201d. So I tried to text and call and got no response. I was so angry that she had taken off and was acting like this was all my fault. I let it go and assumed I would hear from her soon and that they would be back in a few days. \n\nShe never came back. For a month she ignored me. I tried to speak to her mom and she ignored me. I spoke to her dad and he told me I was no longer welcome at their home and not to come there. I have no idea what she told them but they were definitely against me now. About two weeks later I was checking our cell phone bill to see exactly when it was due. All of our bills were set to auto pay so I didn\u2019t know the exact date and now money was tighter than ever so I needed to make sure I would have it. That\u2019s when I noticed how long the bill was. I had seen our bills before and they were 10-20 pages long. We text a lot and she talked to her mom a lot. Well this one was 96 pages so I started digging. I found the same number over and over again. It didn\u2019t take me long to figure out that it was an ex boyfriend of hers from high school. They hadn\u2019t spoken in at least 8 years and I don\u2019t even know how she got his number again. I\u2019m sure you can imagine the type of relationship they were having now. \n\nSo here I am almost a year after she left. We are on speaking terms and I do get to see my son every month. She never came back, never apologized and didn\u2019t offer a dime towards our debt. Personally, I moved, got a great job I had been chasing for years and paid off all of our debts after finally convincing her to sell the house. The problem is that I\u2019m just so lonely. I I only see my son for a week each month and the rest of the time I just sit around at home not knowing what to do. I haven\u2019t been on a date or tried to get one in almost 13 years. I don\u2019t even know where to start. I just wish I had someone again. I barely even have human physical contact outside of the occasional handshake. I can\u2019t even remember the last time I touched a female since I work in a very male work environment and I desperately miss my son. Even when he\u2019s here I miss him because I know he\u2019ll be gone again soon. I just felt like I needed to type all of that out. Thanks for reading if you got this far. \n\nTLDR - wife ran up a lot of debt, cheated on me and left with our son. Now I\u2019m super lonely, miss my son every day and really would like some female companionship ", "subreddit": "lonely"}

Then I had an argument with my mom that morning and I feel like being depressed and semi suicidal (I have a legit reason like literally I\u2019m a walking failure and my existence is pointless) can easily trigger depressive episodes. I\u2019m such a mess. I forced myself to go to school. I was late. Didn\u2019t show up to first period went straight in the washroom. Missed first and second period. Stayed in that bathroom stall till lunch. I hear all the normal teen girls boasting about their great teen life. \u201cTeenage Years are the best years of your life!11!!11\u201d and I\u2019m wasting them being a depressed wreck. Anyways, it was so crushing to hear them notice that I was still in that stall for hours. Maybe they used the bathroom on that floor at first period and lunch, maybe it was he same people or maybe it was my anxiety tricking me into thinking people noticed. Anyways, at the end of lunch, my mom wasn\u2019t home i knew so I literally went back home. Pointless and stupid I know. On my way out of school, a boy from my math class asked me if he had math 4th or 3rd period. I told him it was he last period of the day, and continued on my way out. It\u2019s funny how he asks me that but won\u2019t even notice if I\u2019m not there. I went home and just literally stayed in my room with the lights off until it was dark outside. Depression is crippling. Anyways, FA rant, no one likes me. Like, not even girls. I don\u2019t think I\u2019m ugly, like I don\u2019t know what makes me so undesirable to people. Since becoming depressed I isolated myself from my main friend group for about a year or two, and I feel like it\u2019s too late because they lost interest in me and have all these fucking random new friends. One day I forced myself to eat lunch with them again instead of sitting in the bathroom stall for an hour (without a lunch because of I did buy a lunch where would I eat it alone? I don\u2019t want people to see me eating lunch alone like a loser xddd) . I texted my friend if she wanted to go for lunch. She said she already bought lunch from home (which was true). Then I asked her if the friend group still eats lunch in the same spot, she said yes. Note I haven\u2019t even eaten with them for like 2 months. I go and buy my lunch and then approach them. It\u2019s a line of people sitting in the hallway, all of their new friends say on the end, so none of my old friends I knew for over 4 years noticed I even entered. I just ate my chipotle in silence. It was soul crushing. Meanwhile I hear their random new friends say stuff like \u201cI\u2019m gonna start driving soon, anon take my driving test with me!\u201d Or \u201c I\u2019ll drive you all to school when I get my first car!1!1!1\u201d or \u201cwho wants to get their ears pierced with me?!!!! x333\u201d high school is crippling. I just ate my food and then left, the friend I texted just said to me in person like 20 minutes after I came \u201coh sorry I just got your recent message now ^^; didn\u2019t notice you came until now!\u201d And I forced out a \u201chaha it\u2019s okay don\u2019t worry about it!\u201d I\u2019m sick of trying to be normal. Maybe I should just give up. And I am truly FA, I see all these generic girls with caked on makeup have 2000+ followers on Instagram, and have boyfriends, meanwhile I don\u2019t have a single male friend. And when I eat lunch with my normie friends there are actual couples there, cuddling eachother. And like kids talking about their sexual preferences. I cant take it anymore. Maybe I should do online school. There\u2019s no point. On my way skipping school that day I saw a girl I used to know hanging out with a guy. And i just say to myself \u201cimagine skipping school but not even to hang out with boys like a normal kid. Just to go home to your room and rot in your own depression.\u201d Same thing when I hear about stupid girls boasting about how they do vyvanse openly. Like, I used to abuse it but only to use the dopamine to finish assignments. Like that\u2019s how depressed I am. Anyways I\u2019m obviously procrastinating because I\u2019m not on vyvanse and I\u2019m saving my last 2 pills. Sigh. Imagine doing drugs because you\u2019re depressed and crave dopamine, like normal kids are doing drugs to get high and do it with their friends. Imagine having friends that actually text you and acknowledge your existence.

One week I am optimistic and full of confidence and then the next I am just like a walking sludge and I fucking hate everything.

I find it hard to prioritize thing, make good decisions socially and or physically according toy morals and values is becoming hard because I have no constant morals and values. My life is a cycle of feeling like shit, realizing I am not as bad as I put myself to be, and then forgeting the whole thing and feeling like shit again. That being said though, being FA has been the only constant through out the entire process. In some peculiar way, I find control over my life just from the fact that I choose to be alone, I consider myself handsome, 6'3 and dad bod to the max (but not too fat), and multiple women have been interested in me and flirted but I out of fear of disappointing them and low self-esteem, I disattached myself from those girls. I have been raised with my cousins (all boys) and my mom and no dad and so flirting wasn't in my skill set and so that might be a good reason also. People ask me if I am gay all the fucking time and rn I am not sure, I have gay tendencies, I know when a man is hot or not and I feel like I can put myself in a perspective of a gay person and understand why, but at the end of the day I fap to girls so I don't think I am gay, maybe bi.

Twelve grandchildren. Two great-grandchildren. Three of his children and their families live nearby and he sees his family a lot. \n\nHe\u2019s this older man, his beard white, full head of hair even at his age. He\u2019s a bit fat, his joints especially his knees are bad and he\u2019s lost several inches in height. He\u2019s this tiny little Santa Clause looking dude and he seems so\u2026 content. He never had a lot of women in his life. He was never a fast-talking ladies\u2019 man, never was wild or crazy. He\u2019s traveled quite a bit and had a decent career, but most of his life has been focused on raising a large and loving family. Now his health isn\u2019t what it used to be but his wife takes care of him. She cooks for him. Cleans the house. In the evening they watch Netflix together. Or he plays chess with one of the grandkids of with his daughter who lives next door. \n\nDuring my visit, my brother\u2019s oldest grandson visited with his fianc\u00e9e and their baby daughter.

I've been told not to worry about getting into a relationship but it will come if you hang around with girls. Well, some of the girls I befriend I eventually end up liking more than a friend. Because I'm unattractive and socially awkward, the only experience I've had with girls when I befriend them has made me learn that when you are FA, the following things happen when you are lucky enough to have friends who are girls:\n\nThey only contact you when they need something. Whether they want to vent about a problem, need a lift somewhere, need to know something for whatever they are doing, etc etc. They never ask you how you are or contact you first unless any of the above apply. They show no interest in your life whatsoever.\n\nOnly describe you as 'cute' this is especially patronising when this comes from women younger than you. Apart from this, expect no other compliment about your appearance.\n\nEventually, you may want end up liking some of these women and ask them out. If that happens, expect the following:\n\n\"Sorry, I'm... really busy right now / not looking for a relationship / kind of seeing someone / interested but can I get back to you / not over my ex yet\"\n\n\"I'm flattered, maybe if we got to know each other better haha\"\n\n\"Oh, wow, really? I thought you were gay / bi / asexual\"\n\nOr... everybody's favourite response....\n\n\"I think we should just be friends\"\n\nAt this point, you can choose to keep her as a friend or stop talking to her if it gets too weird. Just remember that all of those responses are just to let you down easily and none are true. You know that when Chad McAlpha comes along, tall as the empire state building, jacked af, trendy haircut, nice car, designer outfit on, deep voice that goes along with a great sense of humour and life goals, that girl will not think twice about ditching you and getting under him as soon as she can. Doesn't matter if he's a dickhead or not. Then that's the end of that.\n\nThe only chance you have with any of these girls is if she has recently gotten out of a long term relationship and will just use you whilst she still isn't over the ex (you get to be someone's rebound, yipee!) or feels sorry for you and dates you for a short while until someone better (Chad McAplha is back) comes along. Either way you end back at FA.\n\nSo, basically, I've given up on having friends who are girls. I know many on this sub don't, but I have many guy friends who are generally just good mates to me, and that's what matters.\n\nBeing FA has turned me kind of into a bit of a misogynist unfortunately.

That was the last chance I had and I made the right move.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAll of this could have been nothing if I hadnt mustered up the courage to kiss her in that last minute when we arrived at her house that night.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI have no advice to give, just wanted to share my story. I feel you guys pain and hope you all the best.", "subreddit": "ForeverAlone"}

But, what's gonna be the point of keeping it, if I'm never gonna find love. Should I give up on dating, and just lose it? Or what do you guys think?. It feels like gods gonna hate me for this.

I'm in the deepest pit I've ever been in and it just keeps getting deeper. The little bit of light I can see at the top is getting smaller and smaller each day. I've lost hope and the will to live dozens of times and I've continuously ripped my brain and heart apart frantically trying to uncover some hidden last reserve that might take me across the finish line but it's not there. I can't take the broken pieces of me and construct some kind of makeshift resolve that doesn't really belong to me but that I'm using anyway. I've been knocked down by life so many times that if this were a boxing match the ref would call it off and my corner would be in trouble for letting me stay out there after it was over. My tolerance for pain is the only thing that's kept me alive, like how some fighters can take 10 solid hits to the jaw and others can take one and the fights over. I wake up everyday and I try to talk myself into another day of torture and out of ending it all here right now and finding my peace somewhere out there in the stars, because I know it's not on this Earth. I know I'll never find peace here as long as I live and I just can't keep plugging away at this in the hopes that eventually something will work out. Because it's not, it's not going to work out for me. This is the life I was given, the circumstances I have, and I can't fight them any longer. My will, my stamina, my resolve, my inner strength, my hope, whatever you want to call it is all gone. The well ran dry a long time ago and there's just no way to replenish it or myself anymore. Maybe I'll be lucky enough one of these nights I'll just pass in my sleep and finally be granted my release from this hell.\n\nTl;dr: Life is a meaningless slog through which I have been consistently drained. Any amount of strength I can muster to stand back up on my own two feet is immediately knocked out of me by life's next incessant blow. I find it hard to believe any of this effort is worth it and that those efforts are in vain. My life's outlook is bleak and I have no hope or even one reason to think positively. With that being said I'm not sure how I can battle through too many more days like this.", "subreddit": "ForeverAlone"}

Two years ago I probably cried myself to sleep once or twice a week at least. Now I just can't. I'm completely alone. Literally each day seems like I'm getting more and more alone. I didn't even think that was possible.\n\nValentines day is coming up in two weeks. It's my least favorite holiday. I'll have no one (again). I'll feel bad about it but i won't show it. I'll keep it inside myself. No one would care anyways. No one cares about me in general. I've had 'friends' who said they cared but wouldn't take 10 seconds out of their day to text me. Same goes with my family. No one cares. I reached out to a cousin just over a year ago and told them how lonely I was. They didn't care. I don't text them anymore. I did a few weeks ago because I had something actually interesting to show them. They didn't respond. \n\nThis is really just a venting post I guess that is going all over the place. I have a lot of built up emotion. \n\nI will kill myself at some point. I need too. I don't want to live the rest of my life alone with no friends, no girlfriend/wife. That's not the only reason I'm going to, my mental illnesses are the other reason but this is a post on r/lonely so I'm keeping it related to that. \n\nI don't have many interests or hobbies. I'm a pretty boring person. I have some though and no one to talk to them about. That sucks a lot, that I have a lot to talk about but no one to say it too. The person I talk to the most is myself. \n\nI'm less important then an animal. I'm valued as less then animal. I'm worthless. I'm the ugliest human being to ever walk this planet.
