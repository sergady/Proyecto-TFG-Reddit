{"post_id": "e46dox", "created_utc": 1575159914, "title": "The 40 Year Old Virgin: A movie reviewed from an actual 40-year-old virgin. (long post)", "author": "Fixed_Assets", "self_text": "In my post earlier today, I mentioned that I'd be reviewing *The 40 Year Old Virgin* in honor of my 40th birthday, which is today.  I just finished watching it and made some notes that I am happy to share with the team.  I'm going to avoid spoilers as much as possible in case some people haven't seen it yet, but the movie is over a decade old, so I am sure it isn't a huge risk.\n\nAll in all, I think the movie was pretty meh and way over-hyped.  It had its occasional funny moments and some iconic scenes that have endured for quite some time, but overall, the movie was not particularly funny or even that interesting.\n\nMy main gripe with the movie beyond its mediocrity is that it didn't really have anything to do with being FA.  The main character seemed to be a virgin mostly due to hangups about being a virgin which perpetuated his avoidance of situations with women, but from what I have seen on this board, the opposite is true.  Most men here who are adult virgins are usually so because of conditions beyond their control, like autism, clinical depression. social anxiety as well as issues with being short, being disfigured, or being just plain ugly.  None of which describes the titular character Andy.  Sure, he's a bit weird and has odd hobbies, but overall, he was a mentally stable guy who was pretty average looking and had women actively pursuing him, which doesn't really fit the FA model.  I think a lot of people who give the advice to just 'put yourself out there' probably saw that it worked for Andy in a fictional movie and figure it works in real life, which is one way at least that I think this movie hasn't really served the FA community so well.\n\nThere are a few FA issues that the movie got right.  It did a good job of portraying the uselessness of normie advice.  A lot of people fail to consider the fact that while normies are better than us at getting relationships and interacting with people in general, that doesn't really make them good people or well qualified to understand what any of us are going through and able to offer good advice.  I think a better portrayal of normie advice would have involved showing the more self-serving arrogance that people like that express when their advice is rejected, but the film didn't really choose to go there, probably because it was more of a lighthearted comedy.  I did find it amusing that really irreleant advice is given too: \"don't put pussy on a pedestal\" was mentioned twice, despite the fact that the main character never demonstrated this particular shortcoming.  I did like how several characters in the movie overexaggerated the threat posed by an older virgin, accusing him of being a potential serial killer - I think that is a very real issue that occurs, especially given how the media overhypes the two recent mass shooter incidents that happened with incelibates, regardless of the fact that overall people with mental illness are far more likely to be victims of violent crimes than perpetrators.\n\nOne of my biggest worries is that it would turn the main character into a punchline, which it did on occasion, but not to a gratuitous extent.  There were some people who made fun of Andy early in the film, but this wasn't portrayed in a sympathetic manner.  He's actually portrayed as a pretty sympathetic figure who we want to root for, but at the same time, this is somewhat undercut by the fact that, again, he doesn't really demonstrate any FA characteristics.  Having said that, turning the movie into one long virgin joke probably would have gotten tiresome, and I think the writers knew that and chose not to go there as a result.\n\nThe script was an ok script, which the characters delivering some good lines, but overall, nothing that was particularly ground-breaking or impressive.  I've never been a fan of Steve Carrell but he does a decent job of portraying the nervous anxiety of a guy who has never done the deed before.  I was particularly impressed by his performance at the poker table and in the blonde chick's bedroom - I think both of those are realistic portrayals of the response a lot of nervous or embarassed men would have in those situations.  The supporting characters are pretty well defined too: David is the sensitive guy who is hung up on some chick he dated two years ago for just four months; Jay is the smooth-talking ladies man who is seeing other chicks on the side and gets surprised when this blows up in his face while Cal is just some asshole who thinks he's got all the answers.  A lot of the female characters were shown as having unusual traits that could be considered flaws by most people, but I think that's actually a good thing - it demonstrates that just because a woman is a hot chick doesn't mean she's perfect and that she's got baggage and issues like everyone else, which is a good way of thinking to avoid putting \"pussy on a pedestal,\" as they say in the film.\n\nI would also note that FA guys who watch this film to pick up tips on how to escape being FA shouldn't bother - there isn't really any relevant advice in this movie that would help your standard FA, mostly because, as I said before, Andy isn't FA for the reason most people here probably are.  Although in all fairness \"be David Caruso in Jade\" is probably super legit advice for the guys who can pull it off without looking like a dork.\n\n**Overall, the movie was just ok.  Some moments were good, but didn't find it particularly funny or entertaining, it just kinda sat there.  It also isn't a very accurate portrayal of the real struggles of FA, but I doubt it could have been while being a comedy at the same time.  If you turn your brain off, you might get some cheap laughs from the occasional clever one liner, but that's about it.  Wouldn't watch again - once was enough.**\n\n**FA Grade: C**\n\nP.S. The ending of the movie was weird as fuck and made no sense.  Not sure who thought a musical number at the end was a good idea, but it definitely ended this film on a sour note.", "subreddit": "ForeverAlone"}

Drank and talked a little. We walked to this place which is essentially a beach but there's huge manmade rocks to slow down the flow of water. And above the rocks there's a huge pavement for pedestrians (It's a tourist spot). So we sat there and talked. She asked me if we could climb down the rocks and sit there. Well I'm a huge pussy (Reasonably so since people have died there while taking selfies atop the rocks) but she forced me and soon we were sitting shoulder to shoulder on a small rock just gazing out and enjoying the scenery. Since I was pretty buzzed, I asked her if we can hold hands. She thought about it but she agreed and we sat there talking while holding hands. Soon we started sneaking pics of each other and sending it to each other on snapchat. She suddenly jumped down the rocks and started drawing dicks on the sand (Since it was a low tide the more beachy parts were slightly available). I joined in and we made like 10 dicks on a small patch and just giggled together like a bunch of 5th graders. On the way back in the train we couldn't talk as much because of the crowd, so we would type stuff in the notes app and show it to each other. Since I was pretty tired, I started to doze off. She took pics of that too and laughed at me later. I dropped her at her place. I really wanted to hug her and thank her for one of the best days of my life, but I didn't have the balls so we just bumped fists and left.\n\nI have seen almost all my peers and seniors do all this stuff in front of me since i was in high school. Taking pics of their SO. Posting it to social media. The notes thing in classrooms. It was the exact opposite with me at that time. If I was present in a group photo, that pic wouldn't exist on the Internet. It's petty of me but these small things really matter to me. It makes me feel like I'm lovable and not just an ugly piece of human meat. She is the only person who has ever reciprocated my feelings, not directly but in these small gestures. She's pretty shy and introverted too so it's quite hard on her too, to go out on dates and stuff but I guess we both like each other that much to at least try.\n\nThis may came off as me being an asshole but no matter how old you are or how ugly you are, just don't give up and stay FA for the entirety of your life. Even if you're rejected please keep trying. When someone you like actually likes you back, it is literally the best thing ever. It's absolutely worth the emotional trauma of being rejected 100 times. I don't have any particular advice coz I sincerely think I just got super lucky but please just don't give up. Although I haven't confessed and could still possibly shot down, I still would like to believe she liked me back to some extent and even that thought makes me smile. Believe me I was practically about to cry when I came back home because I was so fucking happy. I guede that's about it. No more updates from me coz I would feel like an asshole. If you made it this far thanks for reading and hope you do good in life.\n\nEdit: To anyone who is reading this, we have started dating now and both of us have confessed our love for each other. It's been a happy month for me. :D", "subreddit": "ForeverAlone"}

I used to have violent tendencies when I was 5-7 years old, but I'm rather calm now, avoiding violence at any cost. When I grew out, my class had a few groups of friends, two groups of boys, one of girls, and me. I was alone, with exception of one year, when a new student with mental difficulties showed up for a while. He was fun, we had a sincere friendship, but he left as soon as the year was over, and I was alone again. After that, I tried getting in a group, but one didn't even wanted to talk to me, and the other only let me in to make fun of me. And I was okay with that. I let them make fun of me, thinking that's what friends do, but, of course, it isn't. Now, most of them pretty much regret it, except for one guy, he was a dick and still is. \n\nThen I moved to Florida for a year, and that was fun, I guess. I still hadn't many friends, just one or two, but they were cool, I guess. Never spoke to them again, I wonder how they are.\n\nAnd that's when my grades started decaying, moving to another country then back messed up everything in my school live, from what they were teaching to the school time. \n\nMath was, and is, my biggest problem, I had no idea how to do the complicated stuff they were teaching back here when I was in Florida, so the first two years back I barely passed, but the last it was my teacher's kindness who let me pass, and I still was in complete ignorance of half the things they were teaching.\n\nNow I'm in high school, first year, in, once again, another school, and I'm not going to pass, there's absolutely no way I'm going to manage to score high enough tomorrow, but... I don't know, I feel like that doesn't really matter, I just feel like staying in my dark room playing videogames, listening to sad/romantic music, eating crappy food and watching YouTube late a night, waking up at 2pm, and doing it all again.\n\nBut some nights, like this one, I can't sleep, the hole in my chest becomes too hard to ignore and I just stay there, wanting to restart my life, see if I can get lucky and this time make things the right way, then maybe I could be worth what my parents think I am, then maybe I can have the will to do the stuff they think I can do.\n\nI have a good life, that's not really the problem, I am. If I wasn't a self centered dick then maybe I could make some friends, some real friends.\n\nI am sorry, I don't really know if this is the best place to post this, but I really don't know what else to do with all this inside my chest. If you've read until here, thank you, you don't need to comment, give an upvote or dm me, just know I'm thankful someone actually used their time to read my long (and maybe unnecessary) post.  \n\nHave a good day.", "subreddit": "lonely"}

She\u2019s very attractive but somehow I got the confidence to talk to her. We talked about what we were doing in life and our future. I even made her laugh a few times and she seemed pretty engaged in the conversation. Then another co worker came in (whom I have an actual crush on since she\u2019s very much the type of girl I\u2019ve always wanted to date. Pale, cute face, dark hair, colored eyes). I started talking to her to and somehow I was able to chat with both and make them laugh a bit! I told them how long I\u2019d worked at the job (3 years) and my crush said she was happy I was working with them. The whole experience was amazing. Then towards the end of my shift we were working in the banquet room and the co worker I first talked to came into the room with her jacket and I joked \u201cAre you really cold?\u201d and she said yes then passed me and grabbed my hand so I could see. Her hand was pretty cold. It\u2019s one of the few times I\u2019ve held a girls hand. It didn\u2019t mean anything but it was nice...she hand cute, small hands.

I said hello to them but they said nothing back to me, they didn\u2019t even look up to say hi to me. I asked one of the girl what she was going to do for thanksgiving, and she said a one word reply, Chicago, and then I said where I\u2019m going to, but there was no response from her. I then tried talking about plans for the club but she kept looking at me as if she were annoyed and disgusted with me. It got to the point where she was no longer responding to me at all. At one point, she even got up and left to go sit by herself in another room and when I walked by where she was sitting to go to the bathroom, she moved back to the original spot. They talked to one another but when I tried talking to them, they weren\u2019t very receptive. I\u2019m not even saying anything bad or offensive, I\u2019m just trying to be friendly and make conversation but it\u2019s hard to do that when the other person acts very cold and distant towards you.\n\nThis is actually a very common occurrence for me, I would say that half of women I attempt to strike up a conversation with act very cold and distant.

For context, I\u2019m 16, male and gay af.\n\nI have people that I care about a lot, okay\u2026 only one really. I count him as family even though we\u2019re not related and only know each other for about four month. I know he wont leave me, but there\u2019s still something that makes me scared so much about it turning out that everything is a lie and he just leaves me for no reason like people did before him. Don\u2019t get me wrong, I have no intention of ever wanting to have him as my boyfriend or anything, I see him as more than that.\n\nApart from that, I have no one. I have some \u201cfriends\u201d at work and school but honestly they don\u2019t really care about me and neither do I about them (even though I\u2019d never tell them that).\n\nSo.. enough backstory. My real issue, and why I feel so lonely is that I never had any sort of boyfriend and no reason to think that I\u2019ll get one any time in the foreseeable future. Yes, I know that it\u2019s just stupid and I shouldn\u2019t feel bad about this and that I\u2019ll probably find someone at some point but, tbh, I just don\u2019t think that\u2019s true really. Everyone I know at least has or had someone, I'm just lonely and never had someone.\n\nI just want someone to cuddle and give all my love to.\n\nAlso not helping the fact is that I literally never met a gay guy irl and that just makes me feel even worse. Like\u2026 I have contact with people in the LGBT-community, most of my online friends are part of it. But irl, I know two LGBT-girls and not a single gay guy and it\u2019s depressing me more than I'm willing to admit.\n\nDon\u2019t get me wrong, I can live with that, even though I really don\u2019t want to. But it\u2019s just depressing me and making me sad, especially when I see couples being happy together and most of my friends finding partners them self (although that usually doesn\u2019t always last long, but the point still stands). I\u2019m just here and lonely, without anyone (and me crushing on straights is definitely not helping the situation).\n\nAnyways, thanks to the about zero people reading this.", "subreddit": "lonely"}

"self_text": "im not sure if this is gonna turn into a long rant or whatever but i just need to say this to someone, somewhere...\n\nthe 1st sorta mental breakdown i had was in early 2018 when i couldnt stand being socially isolated and dodging every social interaction anymore, at that point i was nearly 4 years into isolation, and i was sick of porn, sick of pc games, sick and bored of tv shows and movies and most importantly really sick of this routine of doing NOTHING while people my age are buying stuff, finishing college, getting new cars, this and that, getting engaged and shit like that\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\ncan you belive that during those years i  went to any people populated place such as malls, stores, theaters etc. like 10 times all together since late \\~2014, because anxiety was  over the roof, except to a doctor if i had to and to, or travel to  job and back, i worked a seasonal job that is only 3-4 months per year, now it wasnt some revelation like in the movies, some thing happens and changes your life, i was self harming for months, sometimes getting black out drunk in my room, and wanting to change but never did a thing to change it, couple of nights before i went to sleep i had an idea to slowly start shifting, and long story short it worked, it all started with spending more time lets say, chopping wood, mowing the lawn, bike rides and by that reducing time on pc, after couple of weeks i started working out slowly but surely, i noticed when no one is at this public outdoor gym so i went then and only then,\n\ni still hated people and was scared of small talk but i was spending more time outside, then eventually fear of people decreased and i randomly started running into more of them, small talk was hella awkward but it helped i have to admit, my social skills were REALLY bad because i spent so much time in my own head over the years and i didnt grow mentally at all, eventually i met a guy i knew from before and we worked out together for months and that kinda put me back into being comfortable to simply talk to people that arent my family or a 75 year old neighbor\n\nfast forward to this summer, i lost a lot of weight, changed jobs, was social from time to with kinda renewed friendships with a buddy or two from high school, absolutely have no problem going to public places, i go to the store to buy stuff almost daily, but one thing didnt change, is this NEVER ENDING FEELING OF EMOTIONAL LONELINESS, i just cant talk to girls, im too clumsy and weird, dont know what to say, i havent felt a female touch in a decade, its so ironic i had more \"game\" toward girls when i was like 10 then now at 24\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\ni cant shake this feeling of existential crisis either, nothing seems to make sense, i try to be positive but its not working most of the times, i mean i should be proud of myself, when i compare my summer from 2017, i was on 210 pounds, pale as a ghost, a shut in, jerking off 5 times a day, nostalgic non stop, longing for the good ole days when i was younger, crying daily, self harming, was drinking alone in my room listening to fucking godflesh and nine inch nails\n\nand then this summer, was working out 3 times per week, actually have abs and i look like a normal fucking person, was going to the movies and on public pools couple of times a months with couple of buddies dont spend as much time on pc, sadly i still had/have porn addiction and occasional episodes of depression but i managed it\n\nuntil august, i was unemployed for months, cant say what changed in me but something did, one day i just woke up and cried for not being able to hit it off with a girl, for not being able to say hi to a girl, to seeing my friends, all 3 of them haha, handle everything with ease, i can only daydream about cuddling with a girl, i crave intimacy with another person so badly, i started drinking more and more again, started talking to myself again, i wont lie, i spent every other day getting wasted before noon and just driving around town listening to music and then talking to myself in a remotely isolated place where i was sure nobody would hear me,\n\nnow i work construction for about 3 months, while it takes my mind off of things i fucking hate having only sunday off, it is life draining and has definitely sparked more of existential crisis working 9 hours a day 6 days a week, i wake up go to work, come home, isolate, day in day out, im back where i was years ago only now im not morbidly afraid to go to the fucking grocery store, im just dead inside and lifeless, 24 year old virgin who is afraid of talking to girls and is not doing anything to try and put himself out there more\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nwow this turned out to be a pathetic rant, might

I just found it today and immediate feel connected.  I'm 38 and have never had a GF and at this point just assume I'll die alone and sad, missing out on most of life's best experiences.  Like the title says, 40 years down, 40 to go.  Honestly, I'm not sure I can take another 40 years of this and really hope I find a way to end it sooner.  I doubt anyone really cares about my story, it's safe to say it sounds like many of the others echoed here and I won't waste your time with it.  I'm more hear to encourage others from ending up like me.  \n\nI see so many people here who share my experiences, the one thing I would encourage, to those of you still in your mid-20s, don't give up yet.  I know it seems like life has passed you by as people around you are getting married and having kids, and god knows your family probably asks you when you plan to do these things at every gathering you have.  But don't give up just yet.  I thought I had no chance after about 28 at finding someone, looking back, I should of kept trying until my early 30s. Sure, you may have to make some sacrifices you never saw yourself making, being with someone who already has a kid, or something like that.  But I assure you, it is much better than the alternative.  This pain and emptiness you feel will only continue to grow, you will continue to hurt more.  The pain you feel now is nothing compared to how you will feel in your late 30s.  People will begin to exclude you as you are the odd person out, you wont get invited to friends houses because they are having other families over and you don't fit that mold.  My only friend in the world has to lie to his wife to go out and have a drink with me because she doesn't think we should be friends anymore.  Had I known now how much suffering this would create, I would have tried harder when I was younger.  I wouldn't have worried about trying to start a career, that's for sure.  My pain consumes me every day.  Most nights when I go to bed, I cry knowing I will forever be alone.\n\nEven if for every 100 people read this and try again, and only 1 of those people escapes loneliness, it's still worth it for you all to try again.

Though to give clarity, I hang out with them frequently, in fact, we just had brunch in the morning at a Cafe that **they planned, not me.** I usually just agree to whatever they have, and I'm just physically there but not really a part of the group conversations as I just nod. Though the type of friends I am trying to establish a bond with are those that I can message about and have a deeply emotional conversation with, which my girlfriend has already with her friends I do not. Let me mention that I've been friends with them for about 3 years + now. It kind of sucks that I live such a lonely life though many of the 'friends' I know think I go out often but in truth, I just sit at home and play games alone when I wished I could have that one League Of Legends duo partner or an R6 Siege companion that my friends have. It dawns on the mentality that I play, study, and basically live a sheltered life when I put the effort in to try to create friendships to get out of my shell. I am not particularly shy either.

I stayed in touch with her through the years and created a strong friendship with her, completely viewing her as a best friend and nothing more but she sought something more intimate than best friends and I had some strict guidelines that made me refrain from entering that intimate relationship with her. To provide more info on her, she started developing feelings for me when I had entered my sophomore year in high school and had confessed to me for the first time mid-school year. I respectfully responded to her and told her that I couldn't establish a relationship with her because I didn't like her, along with other reasons like; she lived in Seattle while I lived in California (I couldn't handle a long-distance relationship), I was fearful of ruining our friendship by being a bad boyfriend, she's the ex of my male best friend who I still keep in touch with). She was an extremely smart girl too and pretty with a small figure and long hair. She was popular while I was kinda meh at my school, knew a lot of people but never had true friends except for my BFF. We had a strong connection like we would call each other in the morning while walking to school, after school walking home, and usually late at night until we fell asleep on the phone (rip phone bills to parents :c). Whenever I had a personal problem stressing me out, homework stuff, or a tantrum, I would rant out my feelings to her and she would honestly make me feel better and conform myself. All the while talking about her day to me soothed me and gave me comfort that she was doing well on her side. Though things didn't stay static like this as I mentioned earlier that she confessed her feelings to me that I turned down, I offered that I'd still be her best friend and she was obviously upset but took the offer and was thankful I stayed the same though 3-4 years in a row, she continued to confess her feelings to me and I did my best to minimalize the pain I'd cause to her when I declined every time. I'd even encourage her to find other guys in her area because I didn't want to elevate our level of friendship. It wasn't til I was 17 and she was 15 when she started going out to party with others and said she was changing and it was true as I watched my best friend change from a humble 4.0 GPA early university student to well just a 4.0 GPA student of the University of Washington that parties hella hard now chugging soju and .. hooking up with guys which kind of brings tears to me while I type this because I blamed myself since my later half of senior year in high school for her negative change of lifestyle. I noticed that she started to get somewhat annoyed of me at times when I would talk about someone I'm interested in (maybe I was careless of her feelings, I think so.) and she would talk explicitly about the guys that she meets that are so rich, handsome, and are amazing int'l students while I'm just a fucking couch potato lol, honestly I am quite the cozy couch potato anyway back to the story, she would I guess try to make me feel jealous and I honestly did though I mostly was kinda happy that she was enjoying herself, just kinda because she was usually with a new guy every time we talked which was about once every 2 weeks-3 weeks because of how busy we were with school. One day I assumed she was drunk and she texted me saying why I wouldn't accept her and randomly said things like how she didn't care that I thought I wasn't cute, or smart enough to go straight to a 4-year university (I'm getting into CSULB Fall 2020...so...I am kinda smart), or that I was living with my parents still (EVERYONE I KNOW THAT IS SMART LIVES WITH HER PARENTS STILL WHY IS THIS AN ISSUE), but I told her I wasn't comfortable with us getting into a relationship so she started ranting about her feelings even more and I tried to reason with her then she started insulting me and it kind of flipped a switch in me and I bursted with outrage calling her an unreliable friend that belittles me when I try my best to help her out, I called her things I shouldn't have like 'slut' for always messaging me about how she took in a 7 inch guy with her throat, and I find that sketchy because she's like 4'7\" but who knows. Though I hurt that trust that she had because tbh, giving out that kind of information is pretty hard unless you absolutely trust and are comfortable with the person you're talking to it about. Though all in all, she and I blocked each other though her birthday resides on a certain day in June and I always message her happy birthday even if we weren't friends, or are 'archnemesis'. She would reply thank you each time and despite how our relationship had ended, I still look up her instagram accounts and like to check up on her to see how she's doing, seeing posts of her cooking, her artwork, just her going to EDM concerts or festivals warms me up because though she's caused me a whole deal of pain, I'm thankful for meeting her for the good times we had. I feel that she hates me for what I said and still has me blocked but a few days ago, she liked a few of my photos from my public instagram posts and I don't know what to think of that as. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFor the readers, I'm sorry if the quality of this post is shit, I honestly was jumbling through my memory to keep it accurate, I am actually leaving out a lot of stuff about her that I find readers would possibly see as toxic like her immediately disliking anyone I sought as a possible relationship partner or being overprotective and too-clingy for getting annoyed at me not responding to her messages when I'm asleep.

I have two loving parents and two great friends, couple of acquaintances here and there... I think maybe its cause no one genuinely cares. No one asks how I'm doing, parents are an exception, of course, no one asks what I'm up to, no one asks to chill with them.\n\nI hate to make stories personal cause usually not as many people comment cause it's \"a you problem\", but I used to have so many friends in high school, was the leader of the group and I had lunch with a friend recently, he said he was bi and that he was figuring out his life and how he felt about the way I treated people, he also reminisced about the bitterness I had in high school or \"savageness\" and that's why lots of people liked me cause I was funny and stuff, but in reality I probably hurt more people than those that I made laugh, maybe that's why they all parted ways. \n\nI guess it all makes sense now, this is why I deserve this I guess. It also sucks when you are 18 and haven't been in a relationship and anything you get that's close to it ends in a hope crushing way, pushing you down deeper. It especially sucks when your mom and dad mention relationships here and there, like some sort of pressure to get in a relationship as if I didn't want one... Well sorry, mom and dad but it's not that easy.", "subreddit": "lonely"}

Contradicting? Yeah, that is me! I just feel so alone and hopeless. I told you in the title it is whiny, what did you expect. I lost my parents when I was very young, an only spoiled child. They left me without any kind of financial security since they were both very ill years before they died, so all the money, savings etc went for the medical bills. They both died in the span of less than 30 days. After they died I got myself some scholarships and went to university where I made some really bad decisions. I didn't finish since I started working and the pay was really good, but the job was time-consuming. Through all this, I had this friend that was my rock. See, the same month my parents died, she lost her dad, and I guess we bonded over losing our parents, though we never talked about it. No, she was always the fun one, the one that made me laugh and forget everything bad about my life. God, I loved her, I still do. She was my happy place, my happy everything. For six years, I was always craveing her company, and she was like my fix for everything bad and ugly by just being near, and being herself. I got fired from my job after almost 4 years, and I went to a different place to find work, leaving her behind. She finished her studies, and got a really great job, then another, and another, and she finally left the country, got married, and has a kid now. See, we always talked how we won't marry or have kids ciz we loved life too much. Silly, pathetic, imature...I know. But I believed it. \nI got a crappy job in the new town. Met a great guy and got married. I love him, I respect him, I would give anything to make him happy, but I don't think I am in love with him. I can't have kids, even though he wants one or two. Honestly, at this point, I don't want kids. A couple months ago I got diagnosed with a nasty chronic illness. Since the sympthoms started two years ago, I had to stop working. My husband had to get another job to support us since my medical costs are growing by the minute. So now, he works two jobs, he is never home, and when he is, he is sleeping. I am all alone, all day, every day. Sometimes I realise that I've only been talking to a cat for two days. My family distanced themselves from me when my parents died for being ungreateful brat..and maybe I was, maybe I still am. My friend's world revolves around her kid and she told me I hurt her when I started distancing myself from her when she told me about her pregnancy. My other friend, my childhood friend that was pretty close in terms that I considered her as my sister, also left the country for work, got married to this super possesive a hole, and has a kid on the way. She recently texted me that I am a shitty friend and don't know how to keep in touch or ask for help. The casual friend, coffee buddy of sorts, that I hung out with for the last year, also went out of the country for work last month, and she texted me only once.

A lonely road to solve the mystery that is my existence. To answer questions that seem to have impossible answers. I have traveled to the Last Frontier in search of these answers. How much further must I go? \n\nThis road is a lonely one. Everyone I\u2019ve ever met, talked to, or just seen have only stayed for as long as it took to walk by them. I miss some, I hate others, and I\u2019m anxious about meeting more. My road has taught me that everyone leaves in the end. I wish I could just stop from this road and be with someone but I can\u2019t. I must answer these questions. I must find the answers to my existence even if that means I must die alone as much as I\u2019ve lived alone. In the end, will these questions even get answered? Will I find peace? These must get answered.  From the ashes I must trudge on. With bitter tears I must keep going. \n\nThe biggest question of my life, is one that I once asked my mom when I was 5. I asked her ,\u201dwhy do I see through these eyes?\u201d She didn\u2019t know how to respond. I knew what I was asking. I wanted to know why I\u2019m living this life and not another. I wanted to know what was so important for me to experience this existence. From this singular perspective. Why? So came forth the 2nd question: \n\nWhat am I supposed to see? \n\nI\u2019ve put myself in situations just so I could feel accepted, included even. That way I can feel \u201cnormal.\u201d Loved. And most important: understood. But none came to pass. No one seen the road I\u2019m taking. No one understood me. Why would someone walk a road that is meant for one person? No one can. So I must keep walking and I have to look at other things. Where people brought me pain I must look elsewhere. I must follow my intuition and my dreams. I must go where I feel a connection with. I already taken the road to the Final Frontier. Why must I go on? \n\nMy dreams show me isolation. Outcast. Stranded. Alone. I run down a mountain basin to avoid a river flood and come across black rock and an infinite view of ice. I feel partial to Reynisfjara as if it\u2019s important. I don\u2019t know why. I know not why I do the things I do. I just want to know why I see through these eyes and what is it that I\u2019m supposed to see with them. But I\u2019m tired. Tired and lonely. I want to lay my weary head to rest as Kansas once out it. Honestly, there\u2019s not a day that I don\u2019t think about dying. I want to die. I\u2019ve tried so many times and yet here I am. I hope these answers are worth it and are answerable. I don\u2019t know if I can take this road any longer. A lifetime of pain and loneliness is too much for me. When can I finally have peace? When I answer these questions? And then what? I must go to Iceland and see what Reynisfjara has to show me. What will I see? From the shadows I\u2019ll come. The skeletal phoenix needs his rest soon so he can be reborn. What will happen to me on the beach? \n\n\u201cTo be or not to be, that is the question.\u201d I need to know how and why I\u2019m forced to live and see through these eyes to see this thing or things I\u2019m supposed to see. I want to die but I must know. I don\u2019t want to be old and look back and realize I never answered these questions. It would be a life unlived. Even if I travel the whole world. Even if I somehow transcend this existence. Even if I got everything this life could offer. I would feel unfulfilled without these questions answered. I must know what is the point soon. I want to die but I need a sign or something profound to prove that I need to go on. \n\nWhy do I see through these eyes? \nWhat am I supposed to see? \nWhy must I go on? \nWhere does the road lead?", "subreddit": "lonely"}

So every time I ask my \"successful\" extroverted friend for dating advice, he always tells me I need to do this and that, and under no circumstances reveal this and that, and don't you dare to say X in situation Y, except if Z - which, of course, you're supposed to know beforehand. Oh, and ALWAYS pay attention to your body language!! Also, you need to practice a lot before actually getting into a relationship, even though there are MILLIONS of different possible scenarios. \n\nThen he goes on bragging that girls are into him when he is nice to them...then he brags about them being into him when he ignores them. Also, you should not express romantic interest, because you wanna be different than the rest of the guys!! But still, make your intentions clear, because otherwise nothing is gonna happen...Make up your mind, man. If I try to refute this by saying that what worked for him does not for me, he tells me I seemed desperate...if not, I'm told it seemed stilted and I need to practice more...always moving the goal post, yadda yadda yadda - is this really how it goes down? Are relationships A JOKE? So, let's assume I DO FIND a girlfriend again (was only for 3 weeks, left me destroyed, almost offed myself), I will always have to be afraid of fucking up during the relationship, because she has options and is gonna leave me, should I do something \"wrong\".\n\nThe worst thing is, I am afraid my friend is right, at least to some extent, and it seriously makes me wanna kill myself, because I just...cannot be like that. I can't just change my whole personality for the rest of my life. I can fake it for a while, and it has gotten me one short almost-relationship (until I decided to be myself - which seriously destroyed me on the inside, as already mentioned).\n\nWhat I see is, most (not all!!) girls, or rather, people in general, like THE SAME TYPE OF PERSONALITY in a guy: Charismatic, confident, extroverted, fun to be around with, always saying funny stuff, never talking in a serious way, and knows what a girl wants and acts accordingly - !!NOT EVERYONE CAN BE LIKE THAT!! - you may be able to fake it for some time, which has gotten me some success in the past - but once you start being yourself, they will leave you. Also, even when I had a \"girlfriend\" for a few weeks, I always knew that she just \"liked\" me because I did stupid stuff like waiting a while to text back, escalating with physical contact at the right pace, paying for her meals, etc. - it felt absolutely fake. This has always been my experience. It seems like you always have to fit a certain frame. \n\nAnd it shatters my confidence and my self-worth - because I personally don't give a flying fuck about Charisma and the like - only girls do. Otherwise, I like who I am, I speak 5 languages, play the piano, have a cool part-time job and am on the way to my master's degree. But since I don't wanna be alone, this has turned me dead inside over time. Because I realized: Everything that I am good at, girls don't care about. Everything that I am not good at, they do care about. So, what are people like me supposed to do, kill ourselves? Problem being, we want to be loved for being us, but only certain personality traits are loved. There doesn't seem to be any solution to this conundrum.\n\nTLDR: One personality trumps all others, not everyone can have it, you can fake it, but the mask will drop if you let your guard down.

She hated me and he said that he never took sides but he lowkey kinda did. She hated me and threw shit in my face like \u201che\u2019ll love me no matter what\u201d and \u201cme and him are pretty close now\u201d which bothers me because I was ALWAYS there for him when he had a break down and even when the tried getting together and only lasted a day because she chose her EX instead of him. He hated her and they started talking again last month. He\u2019s been distant and i said \u201cit feels like you talk to her more than to me, john and justin\u201d (friend group)  He said he\u2019s been busy which he has been but its not right to prioritize his ex instead of his friends. \n\n So after i fought with the ex on instagram after her making a post about me i said \u201clook i dont think i can hang out when you get back or talk to you.  You know i cant stand her and if she is as close as she says she is to you then you don\u2019t really need me anymore to help you when your have stuff going on\u201d  as soon as I said that he ended the call and then I broke down. \n\n I\u2019ve always been lonely so when he became my friend I prioritized him over a lot of people and I became friends with his friend group and he helped me a lot so I decided to always be there for him and care for him. I started to like him and I even told him but I wasn\u2019t his type. But we became friends with benefits.  It hurt me because I liked him with my entire heart and he only like me as a friend but fucked me like a lover. It killed me because it made us closer and i was afraid of losing the friendship so I continued it. But after all of this I dont think its gunna happen again. I also called me two friends john and justin who were supportive and helped me.  John knew the ex because he is best friends with my friend (Nate) and he hated her. I sent him the screen shots and he said that He would talk to him but i was afraid because i didn\u2019t want justin and john ganging up on nate so I told justin to not say anything. John later texted me saying that nate didn\u2019t love her but it wasn\u2019t the point that i wanted to hear. At this time i still dont know what I wanted to hear.  I know all of this is a mix of my jealousy and hatered but i dont understand how 2 1/2 years of friendships can be tossed away that easily.  \n\n Now I\u2019m not crying because i cant anymore.  In my head I just want to get better. Like lose weight (I\u2019m obese and I\u2019ve always had low self esteem) and possibly dye my hair again because i loved the color. But its like i dont have enough motivation to do anything. Even if i think \u201cthis is for my and my better health\u201d its nothing and I even tried being stupid and thought \u201ci can change and when nate comes back to naugy, he\u2019ll see what he\u2019s missing\u201d and it still wasn\u2019t enough.

I was ready to spend it all alone, dreaming of someone to love and drinking until I pass out. Then, in the evening, I received a message from my friend saying \"Happy birthday, when are we going to celebrate?\" I was so excited, that someone besides my parents and brother remembered what day it was. I replied, that I'm not going to throw huge party, but I would be honored, if he and his wife came to my place for a drink. Obviously they accepted.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSoon after they arrived. We spent some nice time watching Friends and drinking. It was middle of a week, so his wife had to go in order to get up early. I took few days off and he had work at 12, so we decided to stay at me and keep drinking.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAt some point, he mentioned situation from a while ago, when he and our other friends decided to visit me and I turned them down and ordered to get the fuck out of here. Then I broke.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI told him how lonely I feel. How painful it is. How keep going became so difficult for me. I told him about moments, when I was with him or with our friends, which strengthen my loneliness and pushed me further from them. He let me speak out my mind, first time in years apparently. After I stopped speaking, he suggested me a therapy and that he could pay for it (he is quite wealthy). I told him the truth. I am in no need of a therapy. I need basic human interactions. Messaging one another, going to parties, watching movies together etc. He replied, that he will help me with that. I was so happy back then and couldn't wait to end my loneliness.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nDo you want to know what happened next?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAbsolutely fucking nothing.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt's been weeks. No single message, no single invite, nothing.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe met once by occasion during our common friend's birthday party. He did not even mentioned what I told him back then. What is more, I've seen a facebook's post of him, his wife and our common friends attending a party, without me of course.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nDid I broke? Was my heart disintegrated and my soul crushed? No.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt made me stronger. It made me stronger, because it proved that I was right from the very beginning. They are one of reasons behind my loneliness. They never wanted to hear me out, they never caring for my feelings and my whereabouts. They treated me like a background character and reached me out only when it suited them. That one time when I told them to get the fuck out here, they came drunk to my place in the middle of night at my working Wednesday in a need of finding next drinking spot. Truth is, they are egoistic, narcissistic, shallow bastards with that one guy in particular.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHe was ready to give me money, while he couldn't text me \"what's up\". He and this entire world is a fucking joke. If you are lonely, people wants you to go away. They are even ready to pay you for that. You can't be lonely. You have to be happy. You have to socialize in a way they tell you. You have to post as much as possible on social media. YOU CAN NOT BE DIFERENT.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHear me out my dear lonely souls. You are the only one, who can make you happy. Don't avoid loneliness, avoid people who makes you feel lonely. Don't let them tell what to do. Find your own way. Loneliness is a high price you pay every day for being yourself.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI am so done with my so called friends. I shall keep looking for that one soul I could spend rest of my life with. I have found strength in a darkness and accepted it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nYou are not the one responsible for your loneliness.

I'll be the first to admit that my depression and mediocre social skills have never done me any favors, but sometimes I feel like it goes beyond that. \n\nSometimes I feel like it just comes down to not having that \"it\" factor. It's like there's just a certain intangible I don't have which prevents me from ever finding success socially or romantically. An intangible that most people possess. There are so many stories of people here trying everything they can to improve themselves, branch out, and seek meaningful connections, and yet in the end we all fail and end up back here. Why does that happen? Being ugly, yes. Poor social skills/being awkward, yes. But while I don't deny the importance of looks and social skills, at the same time we've seen all kinds of guys find girlfriends. I've seen guys who were short, skinny, fat, ugly, rude, mean, shy, quiet, awkward, lonely, weird, strange etc. all find girlfriends, no matter the setup of their personality. Maybe they just have \"it\" and we don't. It feels like there's just some kind of vibe or aura I have that simply makes me incapable of being seen as a viable romantic option by a woman, no matter what I say or do (Someone will comment that the \"vibe\" I'm describing is called ugliness, and that is probably the case for many people, but I don't think my looks are bad, or at the very least they're not the problem). \n\nI've been in social situations where in some cases I did everything right. I once invited a classmate over and we got high and played video games, and it felt like we bonded great. Normally I'm pretty awkward around people and have trouble keeping up conversation, but around this person everything just went so smoothly and we both really enjoyed ourselves, just two dudes getting high and gaming. I definitely thought we would hang again and more often. But to this day we've never hung out since. Everytime I offered to hang out again he just deflected, and eventually it became pretty clear that he didn't want to hang out at all, despite the fact that we still converse a lot while we're in class. This is basically the level I'm at with pretty much everyone: acquaintanceship. While people seem to be okay with me, it's like there's just something about me that stops them from wanting to build any kind of meaningful connection. It feels like I'm just missing the fundamental intangible that everyone else has, and it prevents people from wanting to establish connections with me. \n\nI don't know, I'm sure there's more I wanted to say.

Nobody knows what to call it besides depression and anxiety (which I disagree with almost completely), because what ends up happening is that I don't know how to have passion for something, I don't know how to care about taking good care for myself or others. I have very poor practical reasoning/judgment. Social situations are extremely difficult to find any joy or purpose in. I never have any sort of flow or rational thinking or anything to even say in social situations. Any activity has no purpose to me besides satisfying primal desires such as eating food, playing video games (I believe I play them for the feeling of power), and jacking off. So I do not participate in normal interactions of any kind. I keep to myself because my experience is uninteresting and irrational. And hesitation. Lots of hesitation.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nDepression? I used to think I could change myself, and that sort of thinking caused me more suffering than anything.I can't change myself because there is something fundamentally different about my cognition. I feel more content now than ever knowing that it's hopeless in changing myself. And it's hopeless doing anything at all. But it also sucks because I can't have a fulfilling and meaningful experience no matter what. And to me, it seems like people are privileged with being able to form friendships, relationships, have passion, understand the world, use practical judgment,relate with others in both emotional and practical senses. I also know that most people don't give a shit about what I have to say directly because of this problem. I believe I am doomed to die forgotten and nobody will ever solve my deeply rooted problem. On the count of evolution and genetics maybe the solution to the problem is death. Maybe only the mentally capable survive. I think most of your life is predetermined by what genes you get, and your genes determine your personality. It's like living in a purgatory.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI read a lot on here about (lack of) relationships and talking to women. Just like any other activity, I give up and see no purpose in talking to women even before anything has happened. I had a girl before that was weird, anti-social, but kind and quirky (and rather attractive). But then she realized that my personality fundamentally just sucks. It lasted like 1 month.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSomething I do like, however, are people like Joe Rogan, Jordan Peterson, H3h3, and other popular comedians, talkers, and gamers on youtube that have a sort of sophisticated and unusual personality to them. Also don't ask me for my league of legends or steam username to play with me because I might like that sort of attention but then I'd get confused and ruin the small friendship by either never logging in for 7 months after like 3 games or I might just remove you because I feel bad for being a bad internet friend that doesn't send memes and doesn't know how to talk about anything.

I went through a divorce a couple of years ago which absolutely shattered me and I'm still trying to find my footing in life again. Until just a couple of weeks ago, I'd have told you that I'd been chronically depressed since the divorce. Recently, I've started seeing a new therapist and she put sort of a different spin on things for me. She told me that what it sounded as if I was describing was loneliness, rather than depression and I can't stop thinking of that.  \n\n\nI identify as a highly sensitive person and if I've never found life as easy as others seem to, finding it hard to stop thinking things over and worrying about things. The kind of person that I try to be is someone who is kind, compassionate and thoughtful. Sadly, the divorce, work stress and frustration with the dating scene has made mean just exhausted and cynical and I hate being like that.  \n\n\nI'm realizing more and more how important genuine, empathetic and kind people are in my life and I have far too few of them around. As I look around I just see a lot of people wrapped up in their phones, doing the rat race and buying crap like crazy, but there doesn't seem to be a lot of really authentic, vulnerable connection in the world, at least not where I'm looking.   \n\n\nI feel like I have a lot of love to give and I'd like to be in a loving relationship someday.

I give 110% of my ability to school every day and I continue to do so despite how unhappy I am. I have good grades and my teachers like me, but this is not what makes me truly happy. All I have wanted for as long as I can remember is to find a girl who loves me. I see couple after couple at school every day and it really hurts because I have never experienced what they have. I'm 20 years old now and I haven't even been on a date before. I know that I deserve love just like anyone else does, but when I actually work up the courage to ask a girl out it seems like crazy things happen to prevent it. I have picked a girl that I want to ask and she works in the library every tuesday night. One week I had a doctors appointment, the next the library closed early, this Tuesday school got cancelled due to snow. In reality the chances of her saying yes are probably pretty low anyway, but I'm so tired of sitting and waiting for something to happen to me.

What is so fucking fucked up about us as human pile of garbage that not even one person has made us ever feel the slightest worth and people like my coworker are constantly getting validation and attention from the opposite sex?\n\n\nAnd before people say its the confidence and shit.. I'm a confident dude who's in college and works at a pretty big company at a fairly important position so its not like im some fucking unshowered basement living freak like normies like to paint us in here to be... Yea I'm fat but im still decent looking as are many of you in here so wtf is so wrong with us???", "subreddit": "ForeverAlone"}

I've been through my fair share of struggles which have made it difficult to date. From surgeries to crippling depression my life has been messy and I just didn't want to get anyone caught up in all that. Even though I crave romance and companionship as much as anyone, it's always been easier to keep things casual. I don't usually have a hard time detaching sex from emotion, but my most recent fuck buddy is making it very hard.\n\nHe is sweet, adorable, affectionate, and we have a ton in common. My stupid heart races when he texts me. I get this goofy grin when I see him. I literally cannot stop thinking of him and I absolutely hate it. The worst part is that he's only interested in a casual relationship as well, so there's no way anything will come of it. Plus I'm afraid that the only reason I think I like him is because he's nice to me and I don't want to fuck up the good thing we have going.\n\nSo, here I am, lonely as hell, thinking of how much I want to be with him right now, while actively not texting him so I don't do anything to scare him away.

I\u2019m studying in the USA.\n\nMy brother was a naturally gifted painter. I loved reading and geography. My brother was encouraged to hone his talent - my parents bought him painting supplies. They never bought me a book. \n\nIn my teens, I started playing the guitar. I wrote a couple of songs and recorded them too. They were never acknowledged by my mother. My dad had passed away by then. I was never encouraged to play - I was just told I was wasting my time.\n\nMy brother painted something - my dad would bring his coworkers home to show off that painting.\n\nI worked hard - I was reading books that were two grades above me. I knew obscure places in Europe before you could look them up on the internet. I was told I was wasting my time \u201creading\u201d and not studying.\n\nI was winning College guitar competitions - not even once was I congratulated or asked about them.\n\nI went to study engineering under pressure from my parents even though my heart was in the arts. My brother did the same. He finished. I dropped out.\n\nMy brother became a cop at 25. Everyone\u2019s proud of him. My mother especially. \n\nMy sister is divorced. I saw it coming. I defended her while my mother and brother blamed her. My brother fat shamed her all the time even though she is beautiful and slim. My parents never asked him to stop. I defended her - I was told that I do not understand what\u2019s going on. I stood up to her. I was told I was too naive and young. How old do you have to be to know the difference between basic right and wrong? I fought with my family. Every single day. That what they were doing to my sister was wrong and that I wouldn\u2019t keep quiet about it. \n\nAt 26, I quit my lowly job to plan to move to the USA. I was told that I was worthless and stupid. I was told that I was only worth being a tuk tuk driver.\n\nI got accepted into a Top 25 college with a small scholarship. My mom didn\u2019t congratulate me.\n\nNo one in my family talks to me anymore. I haven\u2019t spoken to my brother in 15 years. My sister still lives with my mother and thinks there is nothing wrong with the way she was treated. She is upset with me for becoming an \u201cenemy\u201d to my mother. There isn\u2019t a single person in this world who is proud of me. \n\nIn college I see everyone and how smart they are. It comes naturally to them. I want to work hard but my brain tells me I shouldn\u2019t because it\u2019ll be a waste of time. I waste all my time with mindless entertainment.

I am a gay boy who needs a mate. For the past 8 years I have cried reclusively, and have become more than broken, I have become fractured as my 20's burn away crying &amp; surviving. Without sharing my life with him, I am living a life or intimate deprivation. This chapter of my life needs to end.\n\nUsing a combination of dating sites, forums, events, and both online and offline communication, I haven't fallen in love no matter how friendly and affectionate I was.\n\nI have been deprived of so much due to not having a SO. I have dropped out of college, I have disassociated from organizations, I have been terminated from jobs. I have been deprived of countless simple pleasures being just one boy of two. I have lost the desire and will to partake in normal human activities and a career path. Due to a series of circumstances and bad directions my true self is now buried under a overburden of despair and despondency.\n\nI am done with platonic relationships, and have given up on the insanity that love will just happen when I least expect it, or that one of my plattonic gay friend will blossom into a boyfriend. Crying for romance has become a daily affirmation. My friends know full well that I cry for love and I need love.\n\nThere is nothing to live for if I'm not monogamously coupled. You will not change my mind on this. I am dead set on being a SO to another male. Denying this is existential fraud, and a violation of my true essence.\n\nI have cried enough. Each Christmas, I yearn to make out with him under the mistletoe, and each Christmas I have been deprived of this and countless other simple pleasures.\n\nLast Call. If I don't consider myself monogamously coupled by December 24th, 2019, I am going to truncate my life. I will disappear into the night to end this deprived, miserable experience. Eight years of searching for a boyfriend and false starts, flings &amp; dates will culminate in a dead body, an idea, and the worst Xmas present imaginable - if I am not monogamously coupled by Christmas Day 2019.\n\nWhere is the minority who know what they have before it's gone? Where are the gay males also crying for love?\n\nMost importantly, are you going to help my cause?\n\nHaving no mate to look forward to after a hard day at work / school, and being deprived of the love other people are sharing all around me doesn\u2019t affect?\n\nI have lost friends because I hit on them, I have lost the will to improve myself without a mate (ive frozen personal growth because years of outward improvement has not closed the deal).\n\nYou are only seeing the snapshot of me today after these 8 years of deprived loneliness. I can assure you that you would feel very similar after 8 years of deprivation.\n\nYou can see my other posts on reddit see that internet preservation is #2, that is the only other thing worth doing. Love is #1.\n\nI was courted by a Sex and Love Addicts Anoumous Group, how can I be addicted to something I\u2019ve never had?\n\nI know what incel behavior is, I have done my best to run away from that up until now. I am not looking for benefits, a sugar daddy, I want his body and mind. I will live with him under the bridge or in a homeless encampment. I need his embrace. I need this bitcrushing to end.\n\nAlso, I tell myself everyday \u201cI deserve him\u201d, \u201cI am a beautiful, extremely intelligent guy that deserves another beautiful, extremely intelligent guy\u201d.\n\nLike an extremely desperate employer who hire anyone who meets the bare minimums (trucking industry), I\u2019ve become the same way, I\u2019ll take anyone to start and then upon finding a more compatible &amp; loving guy, Fire the lesser.\n\nI look at people making a difference in the world, and think \u201cthey have love\u201d.\n\nWhat else do I have to lose for not having his love? 10 MORE YOUNG YEARS? My Digital Life &amp; Legacy? My legs? Do I have to be gangraped, beaten and crippled before love?\n\nNeed a litmus test? If the UN signed a pact that prohibited me to have a love, I would still fall in love with him. The desire for his love is so strong that I will go against global superpowers. Liberty or Death? How about Love or Death!!\n\nI keep my word. December 24th will be my last day alive without him, so I don\u2019t have to endure another Christmas of deprivation. I have 3 PAINLESS ways to terminate myself, as I have had enough pain. If you are going to help me close the deal you have until December 24th to do it.\n\nLet\u2019s get my story on the News.

I'm an 18 year old male who has never felt physical affection from someone outside of his mother. The closest it ever got was last year when my friend in highschool clapped me on the shoulder when talking, and I nearly cried because it was the first time anyone besides my mother had touched me without harmful intent. I was raised believing that if I wasn't helping someone in some way, I was being worthless and needed to do something else. I've spent my entire life believing that I am not a human being, just some tool meant to make others lives better, no matter the cost I pay. I feel a deep sense of dreaded loneliness within my heart, and each day I see two people having a good time together i feel jealousy followed by an immediate self hatred. I have friends, but our friendship is pretty toxic and they make me hate myself even more. I did have a girlfriend, once, but it was only online and she ended up cheating on me and telling me she never loved me, so I lied and said I didn't think I ever loved her either because I thought that's what she wanted to hear. the only time I've been capable of crying in the past 6 or so years has been due to uncontrollable panic attacks, and every night I lay awake in bed for several hours in a pit of despair, wishing I could just have one person I'm close to that I don't fuck up. I don't even necessarily want a girlfriend, just someone I can be around without constantly feeling like shit for not providing them with some form of entertainment, or mental help, someone who cares about me as more than a tool, but I don't think that exists.

{"post_id": "e61loq", "created_utc": 1575476523, "title": "All out of ideas...", "author": "thelambofdeth", "self_text": "So some background on my situation:\n\nI'm 26 and I basically have crippling social anxiety. I feel into the incel scene and few times and because of my lack of any actual female companionship, I do have a porn addiction. I do have a few friends, but they don't really share the same interests as I. For the past year and a half, a least once a week, we go to the couple of bars. One is a wine bar, one is a dive bar. In that span I've been hit on only a handful of times and it's either gone nowhere, or I was too oblivious to notice. But I flat-out cannot approach any female that I'm attracted to. It never gets any easier for me.\n\nThe top two recommendations are also dating sites and meet-ups. I've tried dating sites and it hasn't worked. Not bc the dates don't really go anywhere or whatnot, but because I can't get any. I've has tinder, okc, and bumble active for years and\u00a0I cant get a single reply. \n\nI'm 6'3, black, I work out 3x a week and have six pack abs, I groom to the point of metro sexuality, I wear literal high fashion suits(tom\u00a0ford, slp, Burberry,) I make decent money, and I live alone. I know I'm not really physically attractive, but I'm not totally ugly either, so the complete lack of any replies or matches on these sites have all but destroyed any confidence I could have with females irl.\n\nWhen I go out I'm basically uniformly ignored by\u00a0females. Hell, pretty often I get compliments from guys based on my attire but females completely ignore me. I don't get looks, or glances or casual chit-chat. Nothing.\n\nThe second recommendation tends to be meet- ups. And while that is probably more conductive way to meet a mate, its not possible for me as an introvert. None of my friends are really interested in the ones I'd attend, and I simply cannot go alone. Thus the only option I really had are the bars I frequent, which has beared no fruit.\n\nHence why at this point entertaining hoookers seems to be the only option. The feeling of loneliness and unhappiness is reaching levels I cant handle. Constantly seeing everyone else with dates, fwbs, gfs, wives, etc while I have nothing is just killing me. If I had the luxury of dating sites, parties, tons of friends, still in college, or an extrovert, I would have other venues, but I don't.\n\nAt this point porn isn't enough, and I know empty sex as a business transaction likely won't help my situation in the\u00a0long run, but I don't know\u00a0what\u00a0else\u00a0to\u00a0do.", "subreddit": "ForeverAlone"}

If it's easy for people to identify who you are, what you care about, what kind of people you like, then it becomes simple to network on your behalf. You don't have to do much of the work; people, ideas, and opportunities will all flow towards you naturally, provided that you know a few people who have an easy time of classifying you. People like to be helpful and will do this readily.\n\nOn the other hand, when people can't quite place you, it becomes very difficult for them to identify people, opportunities, and things that they would want to share with you, thus making them a less functional node in your network. My point is that people who have a hard time with other people in general might just be in a bad networking position. This is not through a fault of their own, but through the network effects of being an unusual person. \n\nIn case this doesn't seem compelling in itself, consider the compounding effect that this principle has on networks. If one person networks more effectively, then their network grows more quickly than their peers', giving them an ever increasing edge. This may be why some things like dating and friendships seem unimaginably easy for some people but near impossible for us.", "subreddit": "ForeverAlone"}

I even tried ask reddit, but nothing came of it. I\u2019ve never dated anyone, I\u2019ve never kissed anyone. I\u2019ve had sex, and for a while I was obsessed with trying to have sex again. My first time didn\u2019t go so well, so I thought I deserve a second time. That\u2019s not really the problem, the problem is I think I ruined any chance of a relationship, or that I\u2019m in a place where a relationship would be detrimental to me or my partner. I always bring this up, and I\u2019m sick of it, but I have mental health problems. There are a lot of people out there who are worse off than me, but still I\u2019m struggling with it, so I gotta try to get better. I have this really bad problem where I can\u2019t read myself, I can\u2019t tell how I really feel or what I\u2019m really thinking. People use this all the time to their advantage. if you know me for long enough you can see when I am a little bit slower, and that\u2019s when I\u2019m confused and I don\u2019t know what\u2019s happening. My mom and my dad use this to tell me that I\u2019ve been wrong this whole time. I\u2019ll go to doctors, then I get confused and they make me believe I did the wrong thing. It\u2019s hard to explain, but this is why I got obsessed with getting laid. I convinced myself that all I wanted was sex, and that I don\u2019t want to be in a relationship because I don\u2019t feel love. I was on every dating app I could find, desperately trying to find a guy for a hookup. Nothing ever happened, and time and time again I was flaked. Pretty soon all I was getting were bots and sugar daddies, and even they were running thin. I stopped using the apps, and I realized just how over saturated with sex I had become. Every now and again I get confused like that, I forget what love is. It\u2019s still a vague concept, like a math problem you just stare at because you don\u2019t know where to start. When that happens I think about hugs, real hugs, big warm hugs. It\u2019s been so long since I\u2019ve had a hug. A real hug that meant something. When I forget how to feel I think of hugs, and I cry. I\u2019m crying now, just writing this. I don\u2019t know how I feel, I\u2019m just lonely. Even if I met someone, I\u2019m not sure I\u2019m worth it. I can only wonder what it\u2019s like to fall in love. I used to think I had crushes, I wish I have so bad. No, I never had. I had close friends, and I pretend I fall in love, but it\u2019s just a joke, gone in a few minutes. Is that a crush? I don\u2019t like it, it\u2019s not a good feeling. It feels like a lie. I want to write forever, write everything I feel all the time. I\u2019m scared, not of what I\u2019d write, but of how little I would write. Some people stick in my head. Strangers I\u2019ve only talked to online. They are so much more popular than me. Is that the right word? Does popularity end when your out of school? They don\u2019t need to be attractive, they\u2019re just the type people like. I wish I was that type. I have so many friends, met so many people who are that type. I\u2019ve never dated, all my friends have but not me. They tell me \u201cdating is bullshit, you\u2019ll just get your heart broke\u201d. I always get my heart broke, I take pills for it. Pills don\u2019t do much you know. They replace chemicals that are missing in your brain. They don\u2019t fix your thoughts, only you can. I try so much, I\u2019ve done so much. I\u2019ve met people online, people who are more sad. There was this one guy, just a kid in college, his first year in a good college. He was, or still is, terrified of white people. I talked to him, I love talking, I live falling down rabbit holes. I talked to him about his life, his emotions. He didn\u2019t speak English well. He moved from Vietnam to China, then from China to America. He didn\u2019t speak English, he never learned Chinese, he could only speak Vietnamese. Well, that\u2019s the only language he was fluent in. His class mates took advantage of him, copying his homework knowing that he could t speak back. He was so afraid, yet here he was. He was talking to me. Who am I? What do I look like? I talked to him all night, I wanted to tell him everything I know about being social. I studied that, being social. I worked hard to find the things people like, and to copy that. Eventually I found that he was really receptive to analogies. He was really good at chemistry, and I knew enough to convert socialism to chemistry. I felt proud, he took my advice. I never talked to him again. I\u2019ve met lots of guys who were nice to me. They were so kind and gave me such good advice. It was strange, they were looking for sex, and ended up teaching lessons. I learned to not trust those people. You have to coax knowledge out of people, you can\u2019t let them give it to you. At some point, I got a bunch of guys telling me that I\u2019m too young, that I should find a boyfriend first. I never got those again. There was this one guy, he was really nice at first. He told me everything he knew about gay sex. I asked him the question of course, but he was more than happy to answer. He told me what to avoid, and what to do. It was not new stuff, but still helpful. I never met anyone outside of the app, I tried really hard but they just didn\u2019t like me enough. This guy, he turned from helpful to obsessed. He started suggesting coffee dates. Suggestions turned to demands. Suddenly he hated me, he called me names said I was stupid and stuck up and naive. Maybe I was, I don\u2019t know. Guys would stalk me for months. I never did anything about it. I loved to talk, to learn about people. I like to explore them, see how they worked. That was dangerous, very dangerous. I met some really twisted people. I met a guy who wanted watch me have sex with a 13 year old. I met a guy who kept asking me if I would cook and eat him. I loved rabbit holes too much. Even then, I made it past them. They stopped talking to me. Some guys still hung on, I tried to talk to them. They only wanted sex, and so did I, but then they wanted nothing. There were these younger guys, my age. Guys my age never liked me. I don\u2019t think any of them haven\u2019t blocked me. I would whore myself out to some guys just to talk to them a little longer. They always left. Guys my age were too popular. What was I doing? I deleted the apps, all of them. Now I sit in silence, constantly checking my phone for new messages. I never get any. When was the last time someone texted me? One texted me yesterday, he moved away. I though he forgot about me. No, I\u2019m the person who likes to talk. I love to talk. I always message people, in desperate hope that they would talk to me. I\u2019d talk about anything, I just wanted to talk. I\u2019m counfused, I don\u2019t know what I want. Is that what a relationship is like? Just talking? Wouldn\u2019t I just bother them? I wish I went to peoples houses more. When was the last time you went to someone\u2019s house? I always feel uncomfortable, I wish I didn\u2019t. I see friends spend time together, I wish I did. I used to, I would always do things to get people to spend time together. To spend time with me. How much is a friend worth? I would go broke because I spent all my money on my friends. My family told me they were taking advantage of me, and that my heart was too big. Maybe that\u2019s why I always broke it. My parents would ask for money, to buy things and they\u2019d pay me back later. I didn\u2019t care about money, I always got rid of it. I\u2019m confused. I\u2019m so scared. I\u2019m moving away. I\u2019m living with strangers when I move away. I\u2019ll be so lonely. My friends will all be gone. It\u2019s my new life, I don\u2019t want to mess it up. But I\u2019m confused. I don\u2019t know what I want. Did I do the right thing by quitting my job? I need the money, but I\u2019m quitting next week. I already said I would. My mom said they won\u2019t hire me back. I\u2019m failing school. I want to write. I\u2019m insane. I got all the help I can get. I need more help. That\u2019s why I make these. I\u2019m begging for help. I have 3 pill bottles, I always run out. What did I do? I\u2019m confused. I promised myself I\u2019d get better? Am I better? I\u2019m so confused. I\u2019m screaming, nothings coming  out. I hear my voice inside. I can\u2019t stop thinking. I hear the door close and my dogs breathe. I feel the bubbles in my stomach and my numb finger. I\u2019m so lonely. People say they\u2019re there for me. People want to help. How can you know me? I want you to know me. I don\u2019t know myself? I want to write forever. Text limit. Please don\u2019t do this to me. No I\u2019m fine, I\u2019m just a little worried. I stopped watching porn and just look up videos of people kissing. I watch tutorial on how to have sex. I cry. They make me feel lonely. I\u2019ve lost it. I\u2019m failing school. I work full time. I workout, when will I like myself? I\u2019m overweight, 10 pounds. I need to lose 30, but 10 will work. I\u2019m not obsessed am I? My parents tell me I\u2019m obsessed. They say if you have mental problems you can go to a clinic. Quite white rooms. I can\u2019t go to war, they don\u2019t accept people with mental problems. I want to write forever. When will I die? People say \u201cgod is dead\u201d but was he ever alive? When I\u2019m done I\u2019ll stop feeling lonely, I\u2019ll just go back to feeling bored. Writing most of the day, I have a newspaper story to do. I have a c- so I\u2019ll pass if I turn the story in. I\u2019m avoiding my problems. I\u2019m scared that if I feel in love, I\u2019d get confused. Can I ask someone to take care of me? To help me when I lose my mind? Is that fair when I\u2019m always crazy? Do I have a big heart or am I confused? Teachers used to say I had so much potential. They said that to me but I never heard them say it to other kids. They choked back tears when they said it. I spent most my time in the hall, making the clock tick and the walls melt. Who\u2019s for me? Where\u2019s for me? Where is who is for how and who am I? Please help me. Don\u2019t read this just talk to me. I want to talk. I don\u2019t want to be alone. I\u2019m never like this. I\u2019m confused. I don\u2019t want to be alone forever. I\u2019m not the guy to fall in love. I can\u2019t love. I have isolation tendencies. I depend on my friends so much. I\u2019m glad I have them. When I get mad I cry. I don\u2019t get mad anymore. I just want to write. I\u2019m the kind of guy who pleases everyone. I deleted all the apps. I want sex. That\u2019s all I want is sex. I want to keep writing. When will this end? I have a bottle of NyQuil, I like to drink it. I live with my parents so I can\u2019t host. L, young and dumb. That\u2019s what I always called myself, young and dumb. I cried the day after my first time. I smoked a cigar when neither of us finished. He says he never finished when he fucks. I feel so bad for him. I want to help. When you have anal sex there\u2019s always the possibility of some poop. Use lots of lube. Don\u2019t wash your guts out. When I get lost, I just make a decision and stick to it. I shaved my beard when I lost Kezri to sam. I shaved all the hair on my body. I liked how I felt, so smooth. I\u2019m not crying anymore. I\u2019m 19. This guy said I looked underage, I just shaved. He said I looked like a lesbian. When my face was hard to see they liked me more. I don\u2019t know what I\u2019m saying. Disney is gonna be hard. I hope I meet a guy there. I don\u2019t think I will, I\u2019m a naturalist. In writing there\u2019s naturalism and romanticism. I\u2019m a naturalist. I believe that life isn\u2019t perfect. The rope doesn\u2019t snap after the watch ticks. You wouldn\u2019t know that. Anyways I\u2019m getting off track. What can I do to know who I am? I don\u2019t know if I want to date, or if dating is fair. Have any of you dated? What\u2019s it like? I ask my friends and they all gave me different answers. I liked them, however bleak they were, but they didn\u2019t say much. They told me it\u2019s not worth it. I wonder if that\u2019s how the feel about me. I", "subreddit": "lonely"}

I am a 25yr old woman, and I\u2019ve never been in a serious relationship in my life. I\u2019ve had small meaningless relationships whilst in school the ones where you go out a few times, kiss and that\u2019s it. Whilst in college I \u201cdated\u201d two guys but was too scared to let it go to anything serious or the next step. It hasn\u2019t bothered me until tonight. I went out with a friend I\u2019ve known for a few years and to be honest in no way have I been leading on but I know if the topic ever arose he would ask me out. And tonight he did, and I quickly deflected saying I don\u2019t feel comfortable at this stage in my life for anything serious. After goodbyes I immediately felt this wave of nausea that has not subsided. And it\u2019s hitting me now that after all these years I\u2019m truly alone and cried whilst brushing my teeth. All of a sudden I have these \u201cdark\u201d thoughts in my head and I don\u2019t know how to calm down. I\u2019ve been fine with my life, I have a stable job and loving family. I like the routine I\u2019ve set for myself, I have a hobby I like but I do think of relationships and guys once in a while. But why am I scared, why did I get such a repulsive reaction. And to be fair, I don\u2019t think it has to with the guy whatsoever given that I\u2019ve had these scared thoughts about the guys I\u2019ve gone on dates prior.

All of my friends went to another high school because the boundaries changed. We also don\u2019t talk a lot like we use to in our groupchat that we have. Lately, I also have been sitting alone at lunch because I have no friends. I actually try to talk to people but they end up ending the conversation and we never talk. People only talk to me only when they need help on an assignment because my classmates think I\u2019m smart. At this point I think I\u2019m a loner and I\u2019m happy to be one.

God or who ever the hell is upstairs be like \"yeet bitch you thought.\" and it just gets really fucking annoying bc it conditions you to think, \"omg don't get too happy now, you don't want to get this feeling taken away from you now.\" and shit. but honestly at this point i'm just over it i guess. like i'm really not having a good time here. i don't want to be that bitchy bitch cry baby that complains about minor inconveniences in their life meanwhile ppl are fighting abuse, disease, etc. etc, but DAMN can i get a fucking break from this stale unseasoned life? \n\nanyways i'm actually starting to care about this final so imma wrap it up so i can study lmaoossjssksjk. but no fr in all seriousness it's really crazy how life is. like some days you don't want to be here any more but then again you don't want your life taken from you bc you actually haven't DONE shit w your life yet. and i guess in a way it's ok. like don't stay in the same low ass place forever but at the same time growth isn't rapid nor is it exponentially linear. you will have fucking bad days, yes oh God i've had my share of bad times. like a couple days ago i really wanted to end my shit bc i had FINALLYYYYY gotten an interview w a software company that pays their interns really well. and for someone who has the coding skills less than that of even a 7th grader, a bitch was PRESSEDT. but yeah basically my dumb ass had slept through the countless phone calls that were attempting to reach me. i called, and emailed, and prayed, and apologized my ass off but them bastards still ain't say nun back. actually lemme shut up bc they're not bastards. they prolly very nice ppl but i was just mad in the moment. still am. but shit like this happens all the time. and shit prolly happens for reasons. so honestly i just wanna say that if you're anything like me (which you'll probably will be since we both on reddit wasting time when we should be doing something productive \\*COUGHS\\*) then you'll get this: it doesn't matter champ. it doesn't matter that your familiy dynamic is horrible. you don't have not even one relative to call and console you when shit go south? doesn't matter. do Christmas songs and other holiday time periods give you a feeling of emptyiness and make you choke up and wanna cry bc you don't have that bond w your relatives? doesn't matter. no boyfriend? no girlfriend? no this, that, or the other? doesn't matter. crush not even looking in your direction and acknowledging that you're an amazing person that deserves the world? THIS ONE REALLY DON'T FUCKING MATTER CAUSE FUCK THAT PUSSY ASS DICKEHEAD ANY WAY!!!! \\*clears throat and adjusts tie\\* or maybe you're crush does acknowledge you but pisses you tf off bc they just be playing w your head and giving signals so mixed you woulda though they was learning sign language (amazing language btw you should learn it). that shit really don't fucking matter bc imma tell you right now that i have a crush who fits the description and he doesn't do anything but belittle me and throw shady hints like a lil bitch would so why do i even give him my valuable time? i shouldn't bc guess what? he doesn't matter (peep how i said \"shouldn't well he does, but just not to me. and fake friends shouldn't either. if you're the \"popular loner\" who's friends w everyone but isn't really FRIENDS w anyone, baby i get it. i really do. but that shit really. does. not matter. i already know i'm going to be the one person who gets--yuck i can't even say it--married after all my 'friends' and even then won't really have any one to invite to the wedding bc you know, like i said no pity relatives either. i already know that i won't have the fanciest car, or nicest house, or fattest paycheck--at least, i won't have all this shit if i k\\*ll mys\\*lf. so in order to get somewhere near the shit that DOES matter, you gotta put aside the shit that don't, and focus on you. focus on getting better, getting healthier, getting wealthier for YOU! there are sum point sum sum billion ppl &amp; counting on this earth. some of them may matter to you, but in the end you're the one that goes in the coffin alone. so anything you do, make it matter for you!\n\nlast thing imma say is this. those hella billion ppl i talked about? yeah that big ass number? they've all been through something before. 9 times out of 10 they found the solution to it either by doing something or learning a solution that someone else used to get out they tough times. so do that. read a book. watch a video or something. chances are you'll improve your life little by little and learn that this life shit does matter.", "subreddit": "lonely"}

I go to college now and it's not much better. I do talk to people from college but it never goes anywhere. I never see or talk to them outside of classes.

Other people make jokes, insightful observations, funny comments, and ask relevant questions that come to mind immediately as the other person talks. They sound genuine and engaged. When I talk to people, especially girls, nothing comes to mind. Sure, I get nervous, but I feel like it's more than that. Everything I say and think feels forced, and it feels like my brain is running in overdrive just to keep up the charade of normalcy.

I sometimes can't even hang out with them for whatever reason. \n\nI have a best friend but we rarely get to hang out because I'm in community college and she has work/hangs out with her boyfriend, whom I don't like because he's a piece of shit. I could hang out with this guy who I've been talking to for the past 5 months every single day, but he's busy with work and lives about 10 miles away. He doesn't have a car and I don't really like my family in my business, especially when it comes to guys. \n\nI got caught hooking up with a guy about a year ago and my parents installed security cameras inside of my house facing all the exits even though I was 18 at the time, I'm 19 now. I feel trapped. \n\nPeople don't really talk to me at school unless I'm dressed in revealing clothes or in a group assignment. These two guys asked me for my number once, but I'm pretty sure they just wanted to hook up. Don't get me wrong, sex is great, but I just want friends. Or just *a* friend. \n\nSomeone who I can go to the beach with, or a skatepark for hours with. Someone I can blaze with and they can listen to all the things I have to say when no one else does. I have a lot of things I have to say, random or important. Talk a lot too. \n\nSocial anxiety is a big factor of my loneliness. I can't walk up to someone and compliment their shoes or outfit, I normally talk to people when I don't understand homework. Those conversations never last long. \n\nI once thought I could have a real friend. I met him on an app called MeetMe, he was 30 years old, 31 now. We \"dated\" but that was a big mistake, then after I realized (I was in denial) that he was probably a predator. He probably fed off my loneliness too. So I distance myself now, analyzing people so I don't get hurt again. A \"best friend\" who secretly hated me because of my anxiety. I'll admit, I'm na\u00efve and do sometimes fall for people's fake attempts at a real friendship..just to get in my pants, or whatever sick mind games they want. \n\nIt just sucks. Do I look mean and unapproachable? No one talks me and sometimes guys just wanna hit, but I need more than that. I dress cute sometimes and I draw. So why doesn't anyone wanna know who I am?

I know this probably does not deserve to be on this sub but could u at least give it a read ? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n   \n\n\nHi , i'm a 20 yo male college student that is living under my helicopter mom's roof . My mom restricts what i can do outside her house. During my years if middle school and high school and some college years , i have always played video games with my friends to make the time go by and that was my entertainment. But as the years go by , most of my friends don't really play video games anymore because if life. They have school and work responsibilities and they enjoy more social activities rather than playing Call of Duty or Overwatch. But now i'm getting tired of play video games in general. In the past , my mom hasn't allowed me to go to any birthday parties or any social events with any friends. The only exception to this is when i'am hanging out with church friends and even then , she is overprotective at times. My mom has me on a pretty strict curfew (be home by 10). My mom is so overprotective, sometimes she treats me like a child when i'm obviously not. I just got a job about a month ago at Mc Donalds and i have been working from 2 PM to 10. sometimes i work till 11 or even midnight. So i have a plan to go to the club with a couple of friends. \n\nBy the way, this will be the first time i will be going to the club. I am low key a little nervous but i am also excited about the possibilities of what can happen.\n\nI have already planed a day and scheduled a day off from work.\n\nFirst i will tell my mom that i have to work an overnight shift on a specific day from 6 Pm - 2 am.\n\nSecondly i will need to put a backpack ( inside the backpack is a change of clothes) in a hidden spot somewhere in my car.\n\nDuring my scheduled day to go clubbing, i will have to walk out of the house in my work clothes than go to some a local Walmart and change my clothes. The only thing i am missing at the moment is a shirt to go to the club with. So after i change my clothes, i am going to my local mall and i'm going to buy a shirt fit for the club. From 6:00 to 9:00 (when i leave for \"work\"), i will use that time to change, get a shirt form the mall and grab a bite to eat somewhere before i will go.\n\nWhat kinda sucks (but i don't really mind ) is the night club i 'am going to is an hour away from my house. So i will need to make sure i have enough gas in the car to get there . I'am an introvert so i don't mind an hour long drive. I have also figured out how much it will cost me for the whole night .\n\n$30 Cover fee(entrance fee) for night club\n\n$15 gas\n\n$30 for a shirt ( i hope i don't have to spend that much for one shirt)\n\nabout $15 for parking\n\n$15 for a portable changer because my phone battery is crap.\n\nabout $15 for some food that can fill me up for the night\n\nso in total i'm spending about 120 dollars for the whole night\n\nBy the way, this will be the first time i will be going to the club. I am low key a little nervous but i am also excited about the possibilities of what can happen.\n\nList of things i want to accomplish \n\n1. Dance and just hang out with my friends \n\n2. have a girl dance with me\n\n3. have a girl twerk on me \n\n4. have sex with a girl from the club ( i know, i sound like that kind of guy but a boy can dream right ?)\n\n5. If i don't have sex with a girl, i would like to at least make out with a girl (that would be the highlight of my year if this actually happened) \n\n6. Don't get caught by my mom \n\nI realize that number 4 and number 5 on my list probably wont happen but it would be the highlight of my year and it would mean a lot to me if it did happen.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI am using this to escape the lonely cycle i am in right now in my life . I probably wont go to the club every week but i might go every once in a while .", "subreddit": "lonely"}

Well all those things describe me and that\u2019s the reason I started coming here. \n\nAfter a night of tears and wallowing, I had a moment of perfect clarity. My emotions completely evaporated and I saw myself through \u201ceyes unclouded\u201d to borrow from Miyazaki. I asked myself \u201cwhy?\u201d again and this time an answer came back: \u201cBecause you are not worthy of love.\u201d That took me back a bit because I\u2019m a romantic and have always believed that love was unconditional and something that just happened. I was always told that I was a good person and, therefore, someone would love me. Those beliefs were lies and I discarded them without compunction. I started to draw plans...\n\nI made a covenant with myself. If I forged myself into the best version of me that I could be and I was still not worthy of love, then my life would be forfeit. Grim, sure, but life or death stakes are the only stakes that made the commitment feel more real than some dumb New Year\u2019s resolution. I would focus on three \u201cpillars\u201d: My physical appearance, my mental conditioning, and my \u201cspirit\u201d (this covers becoming more worldly, bold, and creative).\n\nMonths later and I\u2019m down over 100 lbs. and bristling with muscle under the 50 remaining pounds I need to lose.

Hell, I even finished a novel I was writing.\n\nI know that whether I find love or death along this path it\u2019s a much better use of my time on this planet than moping and making vain appeals to the void.\n\nI intentionally wrote this post to sound like a self-improvement ad.

In summary, my therapist handed me some really tough pills to swallow - my ex-wife is someone toxic, from whom I should not be close, that much I knew, but my so-called friends are only around when there's something in for them.

All the times I\u2019ve showed interest in a person (on Tinder of course because I get so nervous even thinking about starting a conversation with someone different in person, let alone ask a person I\u2019m interested in for their number), it has worked out for maybe two weeks to a month, then poof, they are gone. The last couple of people I\u2019ve talked to have lasted more than 2 months, but the pace we moved at was really slow. Even going at the pace they wanted, it still led to them not wanting to talk to me after. \n\nFor example, I was talking to a person from Tinder from December 2018 to November 2019. For three of those months, they blocked me on Facebook for no logical reason. We added each other on Facebook, but we only text message on iPhone. This was before I met them in person. After those three months (now September at the time), they somehow decided to send me a text message. They discussed why they blocked me (literally had no reason). I sort of believed them. I suggested we actually meet in person and they agreed. \n\nSo, we hung out a couple of times, doing some sexual things, but not full on sex like I would have wanted. They were the type of person to tell me all of their sexual wishes (fairly normal that wouldn\u2019t need much preparation), but when it came down to it, they said they would want to slow down. I played the long game with them. I could have moved on to something else, but I stayed hoping it would progress. See, I\u2019m the type of person that would hold out for as long as I could hoping something would change. But nothing would change. I wouldn\u2019t realize it until it was too late. \n\nAnyway, to end this story, they told me that they need to work on themselves or whatever. I said okay and moved on. Now remember when they unblocked me on Facebook? Well, after they decided to block me the first time, I thought it wouldn\u2019t make sense to add them again. So, I never added them back, so I wouldn\u2019t have had much access to their profile as if I added them. Well, I just checked out of curiosity and they blocked my profile even though I don\u2019t have them as a friend and never sent them a friend request after that first time. So, I thought to myself \u201cthis is the second time they did this\u201d, so it was a no-brainer for me to delete all their contact information and block them from contacting me. \n\nBut why must I/we go through this?

As much as you're not going to want to hear this, you have to take ownership of where you're going wrong and adjust yourself.  not to say you're not a nice and respectable person, but theres a lot of finesse and subtlety when talking to women. you have to carry your self in an attractive way and have a sense of ownership. Also, you want to be nice, but not too nice, and don't over validate them. (this one costed me for a long time) You don't even have to be attractive to get a gf. you just have to be likable and have good charisma.(easier said than done, but can be done)\n\nI also want to point out sometimes its really hard to get a start when talking to women. for me, seemed like everyone already had a bf, so you gotta be at the right place at the right time sometimes.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\neither way that was just a brief word. nothing too detailed.

I am so lonely, I have been for the last 5 years. It\u2019s not because I\u2019m shy, I have acquaintances, but nobody who\u2019s close, or I would call a friend.

Despite this I am so very lonely. I have a bunch of aquanrtnces, or people I talk to at school and even text outside of it sometimes. But no actual friends. Nobody who\u2019s going to last once the semester is over. Nobody who\u2019d ever invite me anywhere. People I\u2019ve tried being friendly with seem to literally avoid me and try to ghost me.\n\nI\u2019m very doing well in school, I\u2019m pretty social and not very shy, I exercise a healthy amount, I have hobbies and interests, but for the last 5 years, no friends. I try to get advice but all I get is, \u201cjoin a club!\u201d I have been in clubs and once again have made aquanrtnces but no friends. I have also tried going to things like DnD, but It never really worked out.\u201cwork out, join a gym, improve your self image!\u201d I\u2019m not so basement dwelling loser, like I said I exercise a healthy amount and I am doing well in school. I have also tried seeing a councillor but to no avail since she pretty much told me the same stuff. Maybe I\u2019m just not a nice person, but I really don\u2019t think I am, and even Hitler had friends.\n\nI honestly wanna just give up and stick to trying to date, but that is no easier. I have done so before, both times I did not make it past the first date and they kinda ghosted me afterwards. This semester is over so it\u2019s too late to try again till next semester, and I\u2019m not very outgoing, so I\u2019m not sure how to meet people outside of school. I\u2019m also too young to try online dating, not that I\u2019d want to anyway.\n\nThere was a girl, I nearly made as a friend recently, but I doubt it\u2019ll work out. Essentially I tried to date her, but she wanted to just be friends. I\u2019m happy because that\u2019s honestly what I was looking for. We get along with each other, and text quite a bit, but I doubt it\u2019ll last, and I honestly kinda think she only talks to me out of sympathy based on much of her behaviour. She never instigates conversations, and sometimes seems to end them awkwardly mid conversation. Despite this she replies quickly, writes quite a bit, so I don\u2019t know. We used to sit next to each other in class, walk to the bus together, and talk when we saw each other in the halls back when school was on, but I must have been to clingy or something. Even if I am overthinking, it\u2019ll never develop into anything more than texting about school. I could ask her out to something, (platonically), but she\u2019d only accept out of sympathy, and I don\u2019t want that. \n\nI\u2019m not looking for sympathy. I want advice and help. \n\nMore info in case your curious. I\u2019m a 17M with Aspergers in my first semester of university living off campus, and I\u2019m studying history, something I have always been very interested in.

Now I've been avoiding any sign of a relationship because it's not worth the pain and distress right now.\n\nI miss the first guy, my old friend. For the sake of the post I'll call him David. I miss the physical contact and shit but more than that I miss the friendship. I live close to him so I see him all the time but he's very cold toward me. I've tried reaching out too many times to no response but I can't get over it.\n\nNow there's a new guy, Owen. I've realized, to my horror, that I like him way too much. He's from a very close circle of mutual friends so I spend a lot of time around him and we have a lot of the same interests, although I met him fairly recently. I think everything this person does is purely adorable and I love to be around him, but I'm very afraid to go for it given the circumstances.\n\nI can't tell our other friends how I feel because I'm afraid they'll tell him, and I don't want to tell him because I can't risk pushing him away and ruining another friendship if he doesn't feel the same way. I want to believe he drops hints that he likes me. He's kinder to me than he is to our friends and he talks to me a lot about his past relationships. But idk.\n\nI feel very alone right now, even though I'm surrounded by a lot of good people. I'm going through a lot with my family and I miss the way things were before David and I fell out. I also feel like this connection that I have with Owen is rare in my life and I'd rather protect it than crush it trying to be with him. But what if this is a good chance for a happy turn in both of our lives and I'm being blind?? Advice?", "subreddit": "lonely"}

TDLR at the end.\n\nAnyhow, I turned 30 a few months ago. I've only had one real relationship in my entire life. It was abusive and it ended up with her committing suicide. Honestly my child and teen years were awful. Slowly but surely it turned me into a broken constantly depressed person.\n\nI somehow found a job a year ago. One day a new coworker came to start working there. I grew a crush on her. A big one. We grew closer over time and she's become a friend. Honestly she's my best and only friend nowadays.\n\nBut I'm obsessed with her. Literally. And I have been for months. She turned me into an even bigger wreck. \n\nWhenever I have days off it hurts because I know I won't see her. We see each other after work sometimes but nothing happens because supposedly she's not into dating coworkers. Might be a lie obviously, and this creates another shitty situation because I'm done working there in 3 months. This means I won't see her on a daily basis anymore. This means maybe she will make a move on me but most likely she won't. So I'll just be stuck with not seeing her anymore. \n\nWe're completely opposite on many things. I'm a rather conservative and quiet guy and she's exactly the opposite. She's even bisexual which is something I never found attractive. Politics wise we also disagree on many things, but I never talk politics with her because I'm afraid of losing her if I start being honest.\n\nUnlike her I'm lonely as fuck and I have been for so long now. She has a really wide circle of friends and people she has casual sex with. It hurts. It makes me think like a bad person. I wish she was as lonely as I am. I know it's an evil thing to wish to someone you love, but I cannot help it.\n\nShe's the only woman who has been giving me attention for so long. I know she likes me a lot, but it's in a friendly way. And the way she is and the way she behaves with me hurts so much.\n\nWhen she talks to me about what she's doing in her free time it induces a cognitive dissonance inside my brain because as I said I'm fairly conservative and frankly stuck up but she's not at all.  She's also had many life experiences, much more than me even though she's younger, and I wish I could have lived a life like her but I couldn't because I have always been lonely and abused. I wish I could share my experiences with her but I don't have any.\n\nThere's also the problem of sex. I didn't have much sex in my life. I'm really inexperienced about it. She's not at all. I've even lost confidence because I spent so many years without having sex at all. I don't even know if I actually have a sex drive anymore.\n\nAt work and with me she sometimes has this weird mix of friendliness and flirtiness. She gives me cute nickname, says I'm cute, wants me to tell her that I like her, she playfully acts like we're actually dating each other and she says she finds it \"funny\" that other people believe it. Other coworkers and customers (we work in a shop) have told me we were cute together and that we would go well together. Some ask us if we're in a relationship when we got out together sometimes.\n\nAnd it hurts as fuck because I know she'll never be more than my friend. I also know I wouldn't be as much into her as I am right now if I wasn't so fucking lonely. I don't even know why she spends time with me because my life of isolation and depression has made me a very boring person. I don't understand, and sometimes I'm afraid that she's actually being friendly with me out of pity.\n\nDeep inside there's this little voice that tells me that this girl isn't for me and that she would and is already bringing me a lot of pain and unhappiness. \n\nHell, I've been obsessed with her for months like I said earlier. I can't stand my days off work (won't see her again until next tuesday... already feeling like shit) because I'm alone and I can't see her.  I don't know what to do. I should just stay friends with her and that's it. I shouldn't be into her. She should be a cool friend that I should keep but that's it. I should love another woman.\n\nBut I cannot because I'm so fucking lonely and I have no one else in my life. What should I do? How to get over her? How to be at peace with my state of loneliness? I just want to work on myself and become a better person but I cannot because I'm lonely and because I'm so unhealthily obsessed with her that it prevents me from doing anything constructive in my life.\n\nTLDR: Developed a crush on a coworker. We became friends with time. I'm obsessed with her even though we're completely opposite on many things, which creates a strong cognitive dissonance in my brain. I know the two of us would never truly work or that it would be an unhealthy relationship if it did. She playfully flirts with me sometimes and says it's funny to pretend that we're actually dating and that people believe it. I know I should get over her because she brings pain and unhappiness in my life but I cannot because I'm lonely as fuck and she's the only person to actually give me attention.

{"post_id": "e77mtw", "created_utc": 1575681048, "title": "I don't know how to fill this void in me", "author": "NuclearSteeze", "self_text": "Maybe the best way to start this is a backstory about me (sorry for the long read):\n\nI am a 23 year old guy. I moved to the USA from India when I was 2 years old (so I am a u.s citizen and westernized in every way other than the fact that I can speak Hindi and eat Indian food more often than the average American).\n\nI have always been a loner. I tried to be cool and make friends in elementary school but I would always get teased and bullied. It was worse in middle school. So, in high school, I became quieter. I was still teased, but not nearly as much, because I would just keep to myself, assuming nobody would want to be my friend and that I would just have to deal with it. Well, as a result, this led to me being totally socially awkward and underconfident into college as well. I should also add that this whole time I have been having a porn addiction. I went to a good Engineering college, but I had no social life (like 0 friends) the whole time and an awful GPA (literally just enough to graduate but I failed so many of my major courses. I literally barely made it). Of course, you gotta have a good GPA to get internships and to get a full time position, companies look at your experience (I had no internships other than this research thing I kinda did at the university).\n\nSo, when I graduated last May 2019 with a bachelor's, at 23, I had the following:\n\n1) no friends\n2) never been on a date or any form of intimacy with anyone \n3) I was broke and lived with my parents because I was unemployed\n\n\n\nObviously, I was thinking about ending it all (my professor said I should speak with the college therapists because he thought I might have depression. Maybe he was right but I never have been one to care about my mental health. I just tell myself to stop being so pitiful and deal with it). I had 0 confidence in myself for a whole 6 months as I made futile attempts searching for a job. I ate so much that I became medically obese.\n\nAnyways, something really good happened for me recently. I got a job. A job that is damn near my dream job. Like it works in the exact industry that I have dreamed of working in since a young boy (but gave up on thinking it was just a fantasy) and it pays well (not 6 figures or anything but still pretty solid). I have been working for about a week now. It's a ton of work (more than 40 hours a week for sure) but I really enjoy it even when i get mentally exhausted. \n\nBut here is the thing, despite having this great job, I still have this void in me. I think it is because I still don't come out of my shell. I still hate myself on some level. My team's director invited me to go out with some of the employees for happy hour and walking around downtown. I told him maybe, but I dont think I am going. I think I am just going to lay in my room being a loner as always. I just assume the worst. I have tried going out with people, but I always just end up being kind of left out because I am afraid of involving myself in anything because I never feel like I am truly welcome. \n\nAnd of course, I do want intimacy. I just think I will be one of those few people that will have to die without it (some people just go on without some things) but it makes me sad thinking about it. I do want a girlfriend, but I have never asked a girl out because I am too damn self-conscience (my body, my lack of a exciting personality). But I am a 23 year old virgin who has never kissed or dated so I feel like my ship has sailed since obviously women my age would want a a guy with experience (sure, there is that 0.001% that would be cool with it, but how on earth would I find them and, since there are so few, chances are high we might not even be compatible). This will probably sound dramatic, but I feel like genetic waste with a worthless manhood some times....not all the times...but some times.\n\nOne thing I am working on is getting some hobbies. I will have to work some more to get the funds to do them, but that shouldn't be long. But here is the thing. No man is an island. I really was hoping that this lovely job would completely fill my void, but it hasn't. Because it's the weekend now, and I am back to my self-pity shit. Also the place I live in and work is a crowded downtown area, so I am just a loner in a crowd. I don't know how to build relationships, platonic or romantic, with anyone. I'm just \"cool\" to be around occasionally I guess.\n\nAnyways, I feel like I am rambling now. So basically I want to know how to get out of my shell and stop feeling pathetic.", "subreddit": "lonely"}

It's expensive, it's crowded, and the truth is that while I've been able to make a good career for myself, I feel like I haven't really made any headway socially.  I think the story would be different if I had friends and my own family here, but aside from my job, there isn't really anything keeping me here.  I can just as easily work in NYC and I would be closer to my aging parents who will probably need more care in the next 10-15 years so I think it makes more sense for me to get what I can there.

That and there are a lot fewer single women where I am going.  Most of the ones that are around are under 25 and as a 40 year old man, it's not really socially acceptable to go after those girls.  Anyone who is older is probaby divorced and divorced women probably have a dimmer view of 40 year old virgins than most.\n\nAnyway, there isn't really any hidden meaning or profound message in this post about being FA, just another step in coming to terms with my destiny for those who care what is going on in the life of another FA.

We have a lot in common and seem to have a good connection and make each other laugh (which should have been my first sign as I'll explain later).  She gave me the \"you are such a great guy/I'm trying to focus on myself/if it wasn't for xyz we could date\" soft rejection.  I jokingly said \"you honestly think I haven't heard that a couple of thousand times\".  She took offense and felt I was calling her a liar and I apologized and we patched things up.  I guess I thought we were close enough friends to where she could simply tell me she didn't see me that way, but as I've said before I understand that there are guys who are jerks and can't handle rejection and that most women sincerely feel they are being kind when they give a soft rejection.  I normally just say I understand and move on but in this situation I felt I could joke around a bit since we've known each other a long time.  Like I said we are back to being friends and since we really don't see each other much it's not awkward or anything.  I did break a rule I've had since in my early 20's about not trying anything romantic with a female friend.  My question for the group is was my joke out of line?  \n\nFor the record, I think there is hope for us FA'ers.  I have been getting in better shape and have lost a lot of weight and one thing I have is being a little over 6 feet.  Unfortunately lookswise I'm around average at very best so I have to work harder but it's still possible.  And also for some reason if I seem to hit it off great with a woman or have a ton of things in common I end up getting the great guy but speech.  So now I actually see that as a bad sign lol.", "subreddit": "ForeverAlone"}

I used to be extremely socially awkward to the point where getting out of bed seemed like a chore and I would be grateful for night time to come. I had especially bad anxiety around girls, since they always seemed to go after the jocks of the world instead of taking a chance on a 5'9\" skinny guy with a big nose and goofy hair like myself. \n\nOne of my passions has always been the outdoors, and a lot of that was due to my desire to escape from others. It didn't matter what others thought of me, because the wilderness was always there to welcome me with open arms. As a result of this, I got really interested in hiking, which then led to a passion for rock climbing. A gym seemed like the last place I envisioned I would end up, but I started climbing indoors as well considering the time pressures of college. I learned that I really enjoyed working out, and the improvements I made to my physique really helped to improve my confidence.\n\nNot only was I exercising more to keep myself healthy, I found myself finally feeling like I belonged in my own skin, even if my past led me to believe I was unworthy of anyone's affection or attention. Physical fitness is the forefront of my life, and if nothing else, I want this message to help anyone it possibly can. I still struggle sometimes with social anxiety (I probably always will), but I am more confident than ever before, which goes a really long way when making substantial friends. It may sound cliched, but self-improvement is called that for a reason. It's the best way to improve yourself both inside and out.\n\nBest of luck to all of you, and I hope that you all achieve your definition of success sometime soon!", "subreddit": "ForeverAlone"}

{"post_id": "e7beap", "created_utc": 1575703279, "title": "My Thoughts on Loneliness and Natural Selection", "author": "Ponkotsu_Ramen", "self_text": "In case you're not familiar with natural selection, the basic principle is this: the more successful you are in your environment, the more likely you are to survive and pass on your gene by reproducing. This increases the frequency of \"positive\" traits and decreases the frequency of \"negative\" traits in the population. \n\nI have been thinking about how this may apply to my life. I feel lonely due to my lack of social connections with others. Or rather, I am not as connected as I would like to be. I have no friends who I can see in person and I have never dated or been in a relationship. This makes me frustrated and sad because I want to think that I deserve to have the \"normal\" social lives that many other people seem to have. You know, having friends who they can talk to about common interests and frustrations. Having some kind of dating success like a high school or college boyfriend/girlfriend. And then of course getting married and starting a family. It's not some privilege reserved for the elite. It's common and very widespread. You don't need to be super smart, good looking, or incredibly nice and selfless to do it. Otherwise it would not be very common.\n\nBut then when I think about this in the context of natural selection, maybe it is not a bad thing. I mean if I die alone, without ever raising children, then my socially unsuccessful genes won't be passed on. I won't be polluting future generations with my genetic garbage. I would just be getting what I deserve because I am simply not appealing or not good enough for other people. I guess it won't be so terrible if I let my negative traits pass away with me. My brother has a longtime girlfriend and some good friends in his life. He will probably continue my family lineage. Maybe I just had bad luck with the genetic lottery. Perhaps all of the rejection I have received in my life is a good thing because society doesn't want people like me to populate the world in the future. That's not to say that I can't enjoy my life and do good things in my lifetime, but maybe I should stop deceiving myself with the idea that someone could fall in love with me and would want to have kids with me. But these are simply my thoughts about myself. I think Social Darwinism is heartless and don't believe that others should be treated like that by society. But I think that I deserve it because I can' t demand that I be treated with compassion and understanding in spite of my shortcomings. I don't know, I have been going through kind of a rough time lately.\n\nIf you have no friends and/or no significant other, I am not suggesting that you don't deserve to have a full and happy life. You should go try to form those meaningful connections you desire and you might just succeed! You never know when you might meet the right person who will accept and appreciate you for who you are. This contradicts with what I have been rambling about, but maybe I am so disillusioned with my failures that I can't view my own life with that kind of optimism.", "subreddit": "lonely"}

We have to stay strong in the face of rejection. We\u2019re taught to suppress our emotional pain even though we feel it just as much as women do. \nWomen may be biologically built to be more social so that helps them as they grow strong links with their friends as teenagers, based on oral communication, but still, conditioning is huge in that regard. \nIf we\u2019re depressed we just need to suck it up and we don\u2019t have as much support as women do. \n\nAs a man, nobody cares about you. You have to earn people\u2019s interest and respect through your actions, whereas women have an intrinsic social value. We are made to believe we\u2019re disposable and worth only what we do. \nMost of the time nobody gives us compliments or show any desire towards us. \nOh and we\u2019re supposed to know how to fight or run the risk to lose the respect of both sexes if the situation arises. \n\nIt\u2019s ok for women to treat us like shit in the dating scene. Women will laugh at men, ignore them etc just for asking them out. Probably considering that it must be easy for us to do so. And we\u2019re in general treated with much less kindness than women. It takes a huge amount of courage for an average man to date. And dating apps are the most depressing thing for us.  \n\nWe pretty much go through life unnoticed. \nWe have to live up to high expectations. \nWomen often make us out to be sleazy and gratuitous (in my experience women talk about sex just as much if not more than we do). We fear being creep-shamed, or worse, need to be extra careful around children. We also often worry about appearing threatening or making women feel uncomfortable. \n\nPlease don\u2019t get me wrong, I love women and I\u2019m not saying they don\u2019t have their own shit to deal with : financial inequality, name calling, slut-shaming, being patronized, molested, over sexualisation, body image issues and general misogyny. But what I\u2019m saying is that women, even the most pro-equality, don\u2019t grasp how little society in general cares about the average man. You sometimes make us feel we\u2019re so privileged and in some areas we definitely are but please open your eyes to our reality. You may be objectified for sex but we are objectified for our utility. \n\nI post here because more and more I feel that being a man plays a major role (maybe even seminal) in my almost life long depression and that men (in a very general sense, obviously there are exceptions) experience a unique level of loneliness. \n\nI\u2019m not saying all that out of bitterness and resentment for being ugly or invisible to women,  on the contrary I\u2019ve often been told I\u2019m handsome and they seem to appreciate my company but I do suck at approaching them as I guess deep down I\u2019m terrified by them as I\u2019ve always put them on a pedestal and felt insecure and inadequate as a man. so yeah, I\u2019m extremely emotionally and sexually frustrated. \n\nSorry for the rant and the possibly bad English.

Player??", "author": "negativity_bomb", "self_text": "I am a FA almost reaching the magical wizard status... ironically, my trainer at gym (9/10 cutie I have to say, she is taken, but since I see her everyday, she know about my FA status) have been calling me a Player. How can a FA be a Player? I don't even know if that's an insult or complement. I was brought up to always respect girls and be absolute loyal to your partner. That's why it usually take me 4 years to forget a crush. I never had a relationship, not even close. But being call a Player made me feel bad about myself. That got me reflecting my social life with girls. \n\nI never had a girlfriend, never been on an official date... but I did \"hang out\" with quite a number of girls who I believe friend-zoned me. At this point of my life, I went out with girls ranging from 19 all the way to 35, very interesting to observe how different age group behave similarly and have similar thoughts. 18-23 ish is very flicky and ghost you after extracting whatever excitements you can provide them but never want to commit. 23-28 start wanting to settle down, seeing what's out there, but it's very hard to convince them to give you a chance to take them out. 30+ starting to get desperate seeing all their friends are getting married. They start complaining there is no good man out there, they all died or something. They enjoy going out with you and doing things with you. Sometime, they even ask you to do BF duty for them. But of course, you are not BF material, they will never consider someone so easily available. Anyway, the end result for all age group is the same, friend-zoned. \n\nSide-tracked for a moment there. But anyway, it's 4 years since I got completely destroyed from my previous crush. So it's time to reset and get out there again. But instead of going for one girl at a time and falling into depress for another 4 years, I adopt a new strategy to cast my net wide and go for multiple girls at once.\n\nMy philosophy is that girls always have multiple pursuers, they can choose anyone. My odds are very slim they will pick me. My probability is higher if I go for multiple girls at once. And also, girls hate guys that are clingy and give them too much attention, they view that as super unattractive. By going out with multiple girls, I can divide the attention among them, hence, overall increase my little attractiveness. And also, probably most importantly, if I get shot down, I can go on to the next girl on the list and not be depressed over it for another 4 years. \n\nSo that had been going on for a while, I used to tell my trainer about my \"dating adventures\". Since name is too hard to remember, we just use Girl A, Girl B... and then when we got up to Girl H or something, we just gave up of keeping track of who is who. Also, it just seems a bit disrespectful, kinda like objectifying girls.\n\nFor some reason, fate has it so that I get no one for half a year or so, and then I will get 2 or 3 that I can \"hangout\" with at the same period of time.\n\nSo last night, I went out with one, we had an amazing time at a winter festival on town and went exploring at the park, she even said she can't imagine this small town we have can be so romantic. But of course, she flat out rejected me pretty early on when I first met her. I actually like her quite a bit.\n\nThen I went out with another girl I met recently for lunch and movies. Kinda shy and quiet. But very cute and pretty.\n\nFrom both of these \"dates\", I caught myself mixing up details about who is who, which person I took to where... they even call me out on some of them, then I just said, oh yeah it's one of my bros I did that with. The worse is that sometimes when I am doing things with one, my mind start thinking about the other one, or previous ones on the list.\n\nI feel a bit guilty about that, because that isn't very respectful. I am even afraid FB friending them because what if I post a pic or something with the other girls? It feel like cheating, but how can I be cheating if I was already friend-zoned? \n\nI just want to break free of my FA-hood and settle down with 1 girl, and start a loving family with her. Why is this so difficult? It's almost like girls make it very difficult, do I have to come up a strategy to level my playing field, which made it even more difficult for both of us as we grow older.\n\n\nSorry this is so long...\n\nTl;Dr - Forever alone keep getting friend-zoned by girls... Take 4 years to forget crushes... New strategy = building a list of girls to go out with to reduce recovery time... Starting to mix up different girls who I go out with but are unwilling to commit.

The second are J and M. I'm kinda close with J, but she seems to get annoyed by me for being \"judgy\"(no one else says this to me), and no one is very close to M(except for J) and that's because he doesn't seem to care a whole lot about the rest of the people in the group.\n\nNow the story:\nTonight, one of my friends, W, asked if anyone wanted to do something tonight. F, S, and I all said we would. J said she would be willing, A said she would be busy until 7, E said he was busy, and M read everything, but said nothing. So F, S, W, J, and I all got together and F, S, W, and I all thought it'd be fun if we went downtown and played music on the street. J didn't want to and said we could go do that and she'll find something else (A said this too, but over text). So The three guys and I all drove downtown and found a spot we thought was good. We were just playing whatever and some people even donated, which was a surprise. I didn't play too much cuz I'm not the best at trombone and I just got my wisdom teeth out last week. We were really getting in the groove until J, M, A, and E all showed up on a double date. J was joking like \"hey play something for us!\" and we had just finished a song, so we were trying to get another. She continued to criticize our set up and how we weren't doing everything (so much for me being the *judgy\" one). E at least came up to me and complained about how he was planning on doing homework but he got roped into the double date, which cleared up why he said that he was busy. \n\nThe whole encounter just irked me the wrong way and I didn't know how to feel. I felt angry that none of them tried to figure out something else for everyone to do together because if felt like they didn't need the four of us that went to play music. I also felt lonely because I get lonely a lot due to the fact that I've never had a serious relationship but nearly half of my friends have. I hate these nights where I go home and I know that the people who I'm friends with are living the life that I want to have, but it feels like I'm doing something wrong or I'm not good enough to deserve that kind of relationship.\n\nI'm also worried that J and M are distancing themselves from the group and that M was only part of the group so he could date J.\n\nI get lonely very easily, even when I'm surrounded by people who love me. It feels worse that when I had no friends at all because now I feel guilty for still feeling this way.", "subreddit": "lonely"}

Online or IRL. Judging from the title, I\u2019m unhappy. \n\nIn 2018 I graduated from high school and right after that my girlfriend moved to New Jersey and it totally broke me. Considering I had been dating her for two years at that point \u2014 and everything we went through as a couple \u2014 it shattered my being. I couldn\u2019t even live. Moving on, I met a girl. She seemed perfect, loved comic books, discussing stuff, video games and everything. She turned out to be a narcissist. Now the thing about narcs is that 90% of the time, they are very influential people. I met this girl on Instagram \u2014 and I realized she knew almost all my friends from high school. Including my ex-girlfriend. Long story short, our breakup was nasty. We had so many fights, where she would insult me and completely disrespect my way of reasoning and then POST the disagreements which her goons would then agree with her, making me look even more stupid than I already feel \u2014 it was terrible.\n\nAfter that, I was completely... broken. People who have had run-ins with narcs know how this is. I didn\u2019t even know who I was anymore \u2014 she made me hate myself. Then I realized she started getting closer to all my friends and was spreading BS about me to them \u2014 all the while I was on my own trying to regroup, I didn\u2019t even speak about our split at all. \n\nThen after that I realize all my friends start to switch up on me. It\u2019s like, they valued the opinions of the popular girl over someone they went to school with for six years, some, a decade and more. \n\nWe text, they leave me on read and just...disappear. I haven\u2019t spoken to anyone of them in almost half a year and it\u2019s crazy that none of them even remember me or try to check up on me. Then there\u2019s the one that told me my dysphoria was irritating and blocked me. \n\nBasically, all my friends left me because of the narc and as a result of that, I don\u2019t know how to interact with people anymore \u2014 most people I text fade away after a week or two. It\u2019s so absurd that at this age, I have absolutely no friendships active, and I\u2019m not even exaggerating. \n\nI\u2019m really unhappy, ugh.", "subreddit": "lonely"}

I'm attending a school in the same town I graduated HS from but for some reason I feel like a complete outsider. I started dating my boyfriend at the beginning of senior year. Everything was fine, I had a lot of friends and life felt okay. As we starting to spend more time together my friends started to flake and not really come around anymore. I was confused because I wasn't ghosting them to spend time with him or literally anything that would've made them feel left out. It just felt like I was excluded from the group because I was in a relationship and nobody else was. I didn't talk about it to avoid \"rubbing it in\" and I genuinely feel like nothing changed, it's not like we hung out before I was in a relationship. I'm not a confrontational person but this one hit me hard so I asked my friends what the deal was. They told me they didn't like PDA, which felt like a fake excuse (all we would do is hug each other and hold hands lol, it was at school). But I stopped all of that to make them more comfortable around us and it still didn't work. It felt like they completely abandoned me. \n\nI saw a story of them all at a party that they never told me about and proceeded to keep a secret from me and it hurt me a lot. In hindsight it wasn't the most mature thing but I completely removed and ignored them all, isolating myself with my boyfriend for the last few months of HS. It worried me because I'm a very independent person and didn't want to become dependent on him but I didn't have anybody else. My family is very closed-off, we don't talk about feelings ever and honestly I feel like my mom wouldn't take me seriously if I brought it up. \n\nI was hoping I'd meet new people in college and form somewhat of a friend group so I could feel less alone, but that didn't go as planned. I feel like my depression is getting worse and I feel so lonely despite having my boyfriend support me, which makes me feel guilty.  I don't really know what to do anymore, I don't know how to meet people. Any tips?", "subreddit": "lonely"}

As many of you have come to know I'm possibly the best example of FA in the American Army. After arriving in my unit I felt alone, an outsiders compared to everyone else who came before me.\n\nHowever this would change. I became a bit of celebrity of sorts in my unit, being friendly with practically everyone from my fellow lowly Privates to even joking with some of our Majors and senior enlisted at times. It has been a warming experience compared to my time as a civilian, a time I have come to hate &amp; dread returning to one day. I'm happier now as a soldier despite the bullshit the Army puts us through. \n\nHowever as of late I've started to think of the place I once called home: Arizona and the people &amp; places I've known. I reached out to people I once knew. It went about as well as one would expect, though there is one person left but more on her later. I've thought about the the women I was heavily involved with, wondering how they're holding up, if they'd remember me, if being a soldier would change their opinion of me, if there is anything left worth salvaging that can survive now.\n\nI've also fallen for someone or at least I did. She's of rank &amp; married, because that is just my luck. Around the same time I lost my virginity my feelings for her seem to fade. Whilst I did my best to hide my feelings for I would say I was being kind because she is in charge of supply &amp; I was trying to get on her good graces. A common &amp; plausible excuse. Upon returning to the US my feelings seemed to have fad, but yet when I see her my face blushes my stomach is invaded by butterflies &amp; my brain switches to school boy crush mode. I understand nothing will happen which is why I killed my feelings for her. Beyond work she is a terrific person that gets along well with everyone &amp; while she is beautiful, I feel as if I feel for her more for her personality than looks. Could also be her age as I' attracted to older women since they tend to be kinder &amp; more wholesome than women my age group(18-22), but all the same I suppose. I wrote her a letter where I vented out my feelings, since around this time next year one or both us will be leaving, her leaving the Army entirely or I leaving for flight school or a different unit. I don't intend to give it to her but I did write in it in a way should she ever lay eyes on it. I asked her not to think less of me for it, given my history of romance.\n\nAs for the woman I mentioned, she was a coworker of mine back at Olive Garden. We got along well, clicked very easily. She's married with kids. I remember I got her daughter a gift from Comic Con(a rare Wonder Woman Funko Pop) &amp; I can only imagine how happy that must have made her &amp; her kid. However I fucked up, got to clingy as always. She was perhaps the one woman that whilst I was interested in romantically, I loved deeply as a friend &amp; I would do anything to see her again &amp; make amends. I prefer her friendship over the women I had deep feelings for.\n\nIn just a month I'll be returning back to Arizona, one of three planned trips I'll be making. I have friends &amp; family there that long to see me again. However the memories &amp; despair the wretched desert gave me are enough to keep me away. I don't intend to go after the women I was involved with, minus my former coworker, but I can't help but wonder where they are now, if I'll cross paths with them, if in the end they were happy. As for my superior, all I can do is be the best soldier I can around her &amp; hope I don't fuck it, because I cannot afford to jeopardize my career but also ruin what friendship I have with her.", "subreddit": "ForeverAlone"}

I am constantly busy with activities and clubs as well as a full credit load in college, which is probably why I really value my alone time when I can. However I think I might spend a little too much time to myself. I never go out with friends, I only see them at school or at events for my clubs. I eat all of my meals at school alone. I live in a house with four other roommates and I barely see them. When I come home I go straight to my room and I rarely leave. I feel as though I have a really had time making friends and connecting with people. I actually don\u2019t have any friends in any of my classes, which makes choosing a seat the first day of school and group projects difficult. When new people join my clubs, I feel like I have a really hard time connecting with them. It just takes a lot out of me to be a friend to people as I don\u2019t like to go out or leave my room after a long day of classes, homework, and extracurriculars. \nBut with all of this, I feel lonely. I feel like I have no one to talk to. I feel like I keep all of my friends at such a distance that I can\u2019t go to them when I\u2019m feeling down.  If I never make the time and effort to be with them why should they have to listen to my problems on a Saturday night? I feel like I\u2019ve detached from a lot of my close friends and while we still love spending time together when we see each other, I feel like it\u2019s not right for me to tell them how I\u2019m feeling when I\u2019m not emotionally or physically available for them if they were to need something from me. I\u2019ve even stopped posting on social media because I feel like I have detached so much from everyone and I don\u2019t want to bother people with my life. It\u2019s hard to even make this post because I don\u2019t want to draw attention to myself. \nIs this normal? Is it ok for me to be such a loner and spend all my free time to myself?

This has happened plenty of other times too, but today is what really made me snap, and therefore decide to vent about it.\n\nSo yesterday night, I (14f) go and send my friends a message if they want to hang out and take Christmas pictures the next day. Nothing too crazy, it was a Saturday, and most of us were off from school. However, almost all of my friends declined (Or, well, saw my message but straight up ignored it.) besides a few of them, and only ONE of them (15m) could come to take pictures with me. But I just shrugged it off and tried to be understanding, since a lot of people aren't always free to do stuff over the weekend.\n\nSo, that one friend and I go hang out. We take a picture, stop to get a donut and coffee really quick, and then we part our separate ways. It was a nice, short hangout.\n\nSo I go over to my boyfriend's (15m) house later in the day, since we had actually planned to hang out, and that was quite lovely honestly. We watched a comedy skit, cuddled, all that funky fresh stuff you do with your significant other.\n\nThen, that same friend from before and another friend of mine (15f) show up at his house, and basically the rest of the time I was there we all played a game on his TV together.\n\nI thought nothing of the fact that those two were at his house after I left, but when I get home I get a text from my boyfriend. I ask him what's up, and he sends me a video of him watching a movie with basically our ENTIRE friend group over at his house. It was like my little heart shattered on the spot because of it, and I just burst out in tears.\n\nNow, I wouldn't care as much if my friends did this every now and then, but they plan SO many hangouts together that don't include me, and they always ignore me and talk over me when I speak, I just feel like I don't matter at all to them. I feel like a fucking wallflower to them, like I'm just a background character to them, and it really hurts honestly.\n\nIn all honesty, it just makes me wanna go back to being the anti-social, hermit of a teenager I was before this year because at least I didn't have people pretend to like me and then blatantly leave me out of hangouts and stuff, and then talk over me and invalidate what I say. I would rather them just straight up tell me they didn't enjoy my company and then just leave. but y'know, they can't bother to do THAT, and spare me the pain of not knowing why they never want to hang out with me at all.\n\nThis is probably the dumbest post on this whole subreddit, but I really need a place to vent about this. especially since there's no way in hell any of my friends would help me, considering how much they ignore me. and y'know what? That's not to say they don't listen to me at all, but they certainly don't listen to me about 90% of the time. :( It really just aggravates me, and I don't know how to properly handle it. I seriously just wanna know what I should do, since I'm not good at handling this stuff at all...\n\n------------------------------\n\nTL: DR\nMy friends are basically always together and doing fun stuff when I'm not there, and it makes me feel really lonely. :( It's almost like they don't want me around them.", "subreddit": "lonely"}

Posting stuff like this is a little therapeutic. I used to post things to vent but I like the way reddit is formatted a little better. \n\nI will probably never tell my crush how I feel about her, and eventually my feelings will fade and I'll probably focus my romantic attention on someone else and develop a new crush. I'm not really in the right mental state for a relationship right now anyways, I need to work on myself a lot. I think I have found an aesthetic that works for me, and can style my hair and dress in a way that flatters my skinny body but I have no idea what a healthy relationship is supposed to look like. All I have to go off is a series of awful/abusive relationships I have been in and what I have seen with my parents where my mom emotionally and physically abuses my dad, me and my brothers. I made the mistake to center all of my will to live, goals for the future and self worth around one person because I thought that was love, but it was just unhealthy and set me up to be even more devastated when the people I held so highly and basically worshiped turned out to be not very good people. I want to work on making friends, doing well in school, improving in art and music, and moving towards my goal for the future, with or without someone by my side. \n\nI need to not let myself become so obsessive over one thing or one person because it makes me neglect working on my goals. Even though I'm probably no good for a relationship right now I still want to meet people that could potentially one day be something. I think that's fine? I think that will also help me not get too hung up on somebody that I know will never see me in a romantic light. I want to appreciate them for the good friend they are, but my mind is a little clouded with loneliness and sexual frustration. \n\nOne day I really would like to find somebody to genuinely care for me who I can spend the rest of my days with. That person is probably not going to be my crush. Not giving up entirely on her, but also not going to be putting all my bets on her either.", "subreddit": "lonely"}

I conclude one of the main reasons I am FA is just that I don't know or meet many girls. This is because I don't have many friends or a large social circle. So how do you get one?\n\nI have tried these things, but they have not been successful:\n\nGym - I go constantly to the gym, haven't really made any friends or even acquaintances, the variation of people (different people every time I go, not same 'regular' people) at my gym is a lot even though I usually go the same time an days every week...\n\nMeetups - Been to 10, most people there were around late 30s to 50s (I am in late 20s), attendance of people also was not consistent to the same people, so hard to build relationships, refer to my post about meetups for more details\n\nGoing out to places by myself - walking in the park, going to a few bars, attending some city events, tried talking to some people, but no friends emerged from those events since most already had their own groups\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt just feels so hard to meet people and even make friends if you don't have many friends in the first place.

I have literally no incentive to celebrate or anything to celebrate. But the likelihood of a major life event like marriage or having children will never happen for me so I feel like if I don\u2019t do anything for my 30th I will have missed my last chance to feel special in any sort of way. I feel like nothing else I do in life matters or gives me that kind of satisfaction. \n\nI\u2019m going to be in my best friends wedding near the end of 2020. Im a bridesmaid. At first I was happy to be asked and included. But then I went to her engagement party about a month ago. That\u2019s where I discovered just how low I could really go. At first I felt dizzy because it was too hot and I had a bit of alcohol, which I rarely drink (they provided sangria in a fancy bowl).  I went inside for about an hour to cool down with an ice pack. I couldn\u2019t breathe. I went back outside eventually.  Everyone was now playing that game where the bride answers questions about the groom and he has to guess what she said &amp;amp;amp;amp;amp; vice versa (or something like that). Everyone there was a couple, laughing and having a good, fun time. The couples answered the questions about each other to add to the conversation. I sat there feeling so left out and depressed that I didn\u2019t have that kind of person in my life - ever- to share that with. They asked how I was feeling and if I wanted to play the next round, I said no. After about 20 minutes I couldn\u2019t take it anymore, I went back inside and cried in the bathroom for another 15 minutes. I finally found her mom and asked her to bring my friend inside because I still\nFelt dizzy and wanted to go home. She came in, I acted like it was a physical problem and didn\u2019t tell her what I was really feeling because I didn\u2019t want to ruin her day.\n\nI tried so fucking hard not to feel sad or draw any attention and make it about me. Looking at their decorations of 6 years worth of pics together hung up around the canopy made me feel sick instead of...whatever else you\u2019re supposed to feel. I didn\u2019t want to be THAT friend. That female friend in the movies / tv you see that is bitter and jealous because everyone else seems to find love except her.\n\nI don\u2019t think my friend has suspected anything since a few of us went out for lunch last weekend. Every time the wedding is mentioned, or something related to planning it / the bridesmaids, I can barely contain my tears. This entire year up to the wedding itself is going to be really hard for me. It\u2019s not that I\u2019m not happy for my best friend - it\u2019s just that, we\u2019ve known each other since high school, and I thought we were gonna grow up together and go through relationship stuff together. Double dates, helping each other through breakups, or whatever. Instead in the last 10+ years, she\u2019s had three relationships and only been single for 6 months at one point. She\u2019s traveled everywhere with her fianc\u00e9 of 6 years. \n\nThat entire time all I ever experienced was rejection. Every time I thought a man I like liked me I got so excited only to be rejected. All I\u2019ve ever experienced is heartbreak with no reciprocated feelings or attraction. I\u2019ve never had sex. The only times someone held my hand were when I initiated. But they always let go. I\u2019ve had one real kiss that lasted for 30 seconds or so, which was also initiated by me. The next time I saw that person they went for a hug when I went for a kiss. They ended up ghosting me. Me having the confidence to go for it and have the courage to take those chances made absolutely nothing change, it actually has made me terrified of ever trying again. That was all four years ago. I consider myself lucky that I even had that. But I ive never felt the feeling of what it\u2019s like when someone you want wants you back. I crave romantic, intimate touching so fucking badly. Family and friend hugs do NOT have the same effect. Everyone who says that is full of shit. It also cannot just go away by doing a project or hobby as a distraction. I need to feel the warm body of a person I am attracted to holding me close. I want to be kissed and cuddled.\n\nI constantly daydream about ways I want a man to touch me. Like during the summertime, for a man to be sitting on a chair, me wearing a summer dress, for him to grab me by the hips and pull me to sit on his lap. I put my arm around his neck/shoulders and kiss his forehead. Or being alone in a room together, they lift me up and lay me on the bed or lift me up against a wall. Or we enter a crowded room / bar / concert arena, they have to hold my hand as not to lose me and lead us through (I have actually gotten lost from my group in a crowd for being too short before). Or hand being held while driving together on a road trip. Or being kissed while standing in line for something. Or being held/cuddled on a cold day. Having my neck kissed while waking up in bed to arouse me for sex. God, I want someone to go down on me so fucking badly. There is no replacement for that act when you please yourself, I am so aggravated that I can\u2019t experience that. \n\nI of course would reciprocate all this for a man too, that\u2019s the other side of it. I don\u2019t like most people touching me, but the one thing I learned from the one guy who ever gave me a chance was that, with an intimate attraction and bond (or at least that\u2019s how I perceived what it was), I can\u2019t resist expressing affection through touching. It was such a sting to my heart to be brave and vulnerable enough to take that step only to have them run the other direction. Someone who says relationships and sex don\u2019t matter or that the void created by  not having them can be filled with other things is either full of shit or asexual. It absolutely matters. The feeling I felt after I shared that one kiss and held his hand.....it wasn\u2019t just happiness. It was peace. I felt relaxed. Calm. I almost fell asleep on his shoulder because I felt like my body and mind were getting rid of a bunch of toxins that had built up in my system from not having any way of release (masterbation gets boring). \n\nBut it is so fucking impossible to get to that point where I can experience all this, and have them stay. Nobody is ever interested in me, ever. It\u2019s so hard to meet people and maintain friendships or connections. even though I have friends I never have anyone\u2019s undivided attention. Doing things solo doesn\u2019t work either because everyone else is in groups, and I hate bars because I don\u2019t drink (I prefer weed). What most people don\u2019t get is that it IS considered weird to see a girl who is by herself at an event. I\u2019ve never been welcomed into a group, ever. Not even in school. I had to go around introducing myself Until someone wanted to be my friend. It doesn\u2019t work that way with dating. \n\nI am stuck. I want to skip to all the good parts already. I don\u2019t wanna go through that stupid period of wondering if they like me or not only to find out they don\u2019t. I want them to be very into me and just get on with it already. But finding a mutual attraction is so hard. Every time I exchange numbers with someone it\u2019s me who initiates it. Same with texting. Same with seeing each other in person. I don\u2019t remember the last time a man did this for me first. I don\u2019t think they ever have. There have been so many times where I was convinced that a man was into me, but I was wrong. I was seeing things that weren\u2019t really there / didn\u2019t mean anything like I thought it did because I was the one who liked them and wanted it so badly. I don\u2019t know for sure if anyone has ever wanted me because it was all in a my head based on hope. Idk what was real and what wasn\u2019t. All I know is that I\u2019ve been alone my entire life and I\u2019m so miserable and it never gets better. Yes I have a therapist, but it doesn\u2019t make a difference. I suffer all on my own and I can\u2019t do anything about it. I was actively doing something about it for many years and I got nothing. I\u2019ve had to watch all my friends pair up over and over without a problem while I struggled alone. I would do anything to experience a relationship and sex and love. It was not supposed to be like this. I was not supposed to be alone my entire life. I never asked for this. All I\u2019ve ever wanted was for someone besides myself to love me and care about me and show it. The rec sport I play doesn\u2019t fulfill me. The baked goods I make doesn\u2019t substitute hugs and kisses. The paintings I create don\u2019t take away the pain of lonliness. Being in the company of friends and family isn\u2019t enough when they have their SOs with them. I want more than what I have. Why is it so bad that I feel that way? Why can\u2019t I have it? What do I have to do to have it? Where is the right time and right place to meet the one person who will share that love with me so I can end this suffering? I want to be touched. Constantly. So fucking badly. I\u2019m so thirsty, it\u2019s not even funny.", "subreddit": "ForeverAlone"}

I don't think I have ever cried as much as I am right now.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo let's start off with me. I am a 34-year-old who would fit into incel. I do classify myself as a nice guy but not the one who calls girls derogatory names when they don't get their way.  I know I don't have very much self-esteem or confidence. The vast majority of that stems from me being alone all my life. I've never had a girlfriend, and I have never had very many friends either. No one in my life outside of family has ever told me I was handsome, I was worth it, I am a great guy, that they missed me or anything like that. I have grown up in a world where everyone around me told me I was scum, a loser, and other very nasty words. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo recently this wonderful woman came into my life. Ill call her Jane. Jane and I have actually been good friends since High school. And as a matter of fact thats when I fell in love with her. I will never forget that moment, I was being bullied on the bus heading out. I tried my hardest to ignore them, and as they were putting me down I looked out the window and saw her. Walking by. The most gorgeous girl I had ever seen in my life! That moment time froze, the punches, the insults, the spit wads and pop cans being thrown at me ceased to exist. For that moment it was just her, and I felt happiness for the first time in my life. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTLDR the next 15 years: I was a coward and never asked her out. Plus I never ask out a girl when she's dating someone else. She had a few long term boyfriends in high school, I tried dating a few others but always wound up being used or led on. and tons of heartbreak in there for me.  We had become close friends in School. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo I left High school to move on, still in love with this girl. She joined the Army. I started Trucking. \n\nA few years ago we reconnected on facebook. Still, good friends, she was divorced and remarried. I was happy for her. She then started telling me how her husband was abusing her and sought my advice. I helped in every way I could. They finally got a divorce and he is in prison. I missed my opportunity to tell her how I felt because she started dating another guy. I was still happy for her. But she started to practically beg me to come visit her. I never did because for one I didnt want her current boyfriend to be jeleous, and for two, I did not want my feelings for her to resurface. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFast forward a bit of time, she broke up with that guy and I finally gave in and told her how I felt.  I told her everything, that I was in love with her and the whole 9 yards. Everything. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe ignored it for a few days, and it was a tough few days but she eventually responded, saying that she was flattered, and she had no idea but she was not ready to date yet. \n\nWe agreed to meet, and she even agreed to let me meet her kids, and from that moment on it has been the best few months of my life. \n\nBoth of her kids absolutely adore me, her daughter loves me so much. I love them just as much, they are wonderful kids!\n\nEvery chance I got to drive through her town I took the chance and stoped in to visit, even staying the night a few times. \n\nOver the last 3 months we have (at least I thought so) grown so close, I never thought I could love her even more. I found myself falling more and more in love with her each time I saw her. \n\nEven though she kept saying all she needed is a friend and nothing more, and would not date me yet, she kept throwing signs of interest. She would flirt with me here and there. Shove food in my mouth, hug me close and tight. Stare into my eyes deeply. \n\nWe even kissed. \n\nEvery chance I got to drive through her town I took the chance and stopped in to visit, even staying the night a few times.  myself falling more and more in love with her each time I saw her. ushed it off as not possible. Come to find out, she had that exact same feeling before she picked me up as well. This becomes important shortly here. \n\nThat day was just like any others, but she made the comment on how christmas is going to be boring for her. Well I made the mistake of smirking and giggling a bit and she knew something was up. You see, I had created this master plan to bring her home (she lives 2 states away now) to our hometown, where we grew up, and meet her best friends from high school again. I tried so hard not to tell her. She made the remark \"If you tell me, I will give you the one thing you have been wanting since high school\" I asked her what it was and she made the motion of a kiss. I didnt like that and I said Do not do that, please do not do that. I want our first kiss to be something you really want, not a payment for telling you something. I wound up telling her anyways because I am bad at holding secrets. She was so happy that day, I have never seen her so happy before in my life. She was just insanely excited. \n\nThe day went by normally, her unable to stop talking about her friends. When she dropped me back off at my truck, she was super nervous. We did our normal goodbye hug, she held me a bit tighter and longer this time. We seperated, and she would not leave. She kept talking about random things. She gave me a longer tighter hug again, then seperated. She started talking about my dog. And then she came in for a third longer and tighter hug. At the end of that one she seperated from me but still held her arms around me and said \"Oh by the way I cant forget this\" and gave me the most wonderful kiss I had ever felt. It was my first kiss ever. It was long, and amazing. \n\nNow she claims the kiss was only a \"Bribe\" payment but I am refusing to believe that. It was not some peck on the lips. It was not nothing. It felt way more than that. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo we hung out a lot more since that day, I even spent a week and a half at her house over thanksgiving, \n\nWe talked about everything. JHow bad I am with women, how I don't know how to talk to them. We even talked about sex, and fantasies and all that. \n\nIn between all of this I decided to help her out in any way I could, and right now unfortunately because I have no idea how to be a normal person, the only thing I can think of to impress her is Money. I make a lot of it. Ive paid multiple bills, spent over a grand in dinners with them, On my birthday I took them out to this big christmas event in Nashville that I paid everything for. I bought her son an iphone that he desperatly wanted that she couldnt afford. I even have her set up with her states food stamps and child care assistance programs sicne she gave me her SSN (Don't worry people I am not the type of person to use that against her. I never will) I have taken them out to places they never would have before and showed them all what love is. THose kids are begging for me to be in their lives honestly. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo a few days ago I was a bit more down and emotional than normal. She kept getting on me about getting my hair cut. I normally give it a buzz cut and call it a day. I like buzz cuts, granted no one else seems to like me with it but I seriously like it. So I decided to get something diffrent for her, she wanted me to have something diffrent. I showed her pictures of it and all she could say was \"It looks better.\" and I do not know why but that triggered my depression. I posted it on facebook and of course all my family said I looked great, was handsome etc. etc. Then her mother commented saying I was handsome. And that struck a nerve with me. I told her \"At least your mother thinks I am handsome\" to which she repleid \"Real cute\" and it went downhill from there. I had realized my mistake, and tried appologizeing for it. Saying I dont know how to control my emotions sometimes and theres going to be a day where I say something that I will lose her over. And that day was the very next day. I was still a bit down, and she forced the reason out of me. I told her Im just a little tired of showing you love, and not getting anything back. Shes never said I was handsome, never said she misses me never given me any compliments. Told her I know all she needs is a friend right now but I need something more.    \n\n\nIts been 2 days since I heard from her. We have been talking every single day for the last 2 months. Without fail. Good mornings, good nights, phone calls in between. Every single day. Except for the last 2 days. Not a single word from her.   \n\n\nI'm devastated.

I thank anyone who takes the time to read it. It\u2019ll mean so much to me. \n\nHere is my daily routine:\n\nMy alarm goes off 2 hours before my work shift. I then lay around for 30 minutes and then get up to take a 30-45 minute shower in which I sit down in said shower and look at all my notifications and check the weather (I live in Alaska and I need to know how cold it is to dictate what I wear and if I need to warm up my car). I then spend the rest of the time getting dressed and grab something easy to eat which is usually just lunch meat and a yogurt. I then fill my back pack with a soda, v8 juice, and fruit juice and take a yogurt to go. At work I sit at a desk and check my email for company updates and customers requesting supplies and I play on my phone until I have a customer. My play-on-my-phone time is usually watching YouTube for music and video games and sometimes an inspirational video. I do this for 8 hours and I spread my backpack food over the course of that day. After work I head home, take off my shoes (which are laced shoes that I turned into slip ons) and take off my layers and my pants. I hate wearing socks and prefer to walk around the apartment barefoot with a t shirt and my underwear. If I feel gross I will take another shower otherwise I pour myself a drink like whiskey with coke or a coffee with cream and sugar and then microwave a TV dinner. After that I turn on my tv and check to see if my online friends are on so we can play Destiny 2 together. If not I go to YouTube to see if I haven\u2019t missed anything or to put on a gameplay video of the games I love. If nothing is there then I turn on Netflix to see what I can find. If not there then I rotate to checking if my online friends are on then to YouTube and then to Netflix. I repeat this behavior until it gets late or until I find something I like or if my friends hop on. I then fall asleep and repeat this Monday through Friday as since those are the days I work. On Saturday, I wake up and immediately take a shower for 30-45 minutes and then turn on my PS4 to repeat my game, YouTube, and Netflix trifecta until it\u2019s late or something sticks. On Sunday, I wake up, take my 30-45 minute shower, and get dressed in comfy clothes. I go to the laundry room in my apartment complex and start the wash load. I then set a timer for 45 mins and then I leave the apartment and go grocery shopping and collect my mail for the week and then when I get home I put all my groceries away and then rotate my laundry. I then set a timer for 50 minutes and then turn on my PS4 and repeat my game, youtube, Netflix trifecta until my timer sounds off and then I get my laundry, put it all away or dump it on my bed (depending on my depression and loneliness) and then return to my trifecta until it\u2019s late or I find something I like. And then the week restarts and I repeat the process. \n\nSome random things that sometimes changes my routine:\n\nOn Saturday, if there is a movie I\u2019d like to see in theater I use the Regal app to preorder my ticket and I always buy a matinee. I\u2019d do my normal morning routine as if getting ready to work (wake up two hours before, 30-45 min shower, etc) and then go watch the movie and then return home to proceed with my PS4 trifecta. \n\nSometimes if I have a craving I\u2019ll go out to eat once a week (usually on Saturday) and I always go somewhere I never been to. \n\nThis is the blueprint of everyday. Yes in all the in between moments I talk to my coworkers and I talk to waitresses/ waiters and the people who work at the movies. I talk to my online friends when we get a chance. But still I feel completely lonely, isolated, and depressed. I have broken many routines and I done many spontaneous things in my life to reach out and meet people and try to find that one meaningful connection but nothing sticks. I\u2019m 29 now and I\u2019m no different than the old man who has outlived all his friends and family. I feel lonely and no one really cares to get to know me. I just want a real connection and I honestly feel it\u2019s too late for me. I\u2019m not exactly bad looking but I think my problem is that I\u2019m awkward and weird. My face looks unapproachable even if I\u2019m in a great mood. Just a constant resting bitch face for a dude. So my \u201caura\u201d or \u201cvibe\u201d or the impression I give is that I\u2019m someone who can\u2019t be interrupted even though that is further from the truth. I want to be interrupted. I want my life to change for the better if that means a connection is involved. I just wish I could be seen despite my isolation.", "subreddit": "lonely"}

But ever since I entered high school six years ago, and stopped being an awful little kid, I realized how little of it I've gotten. So I set some goals for myself, figuring that *one* of those would help me out.\n\nI've accomplished so many of my goals, and nothing works. *Nothing.*\n\nI have a girlfriend. We have an amazing relationship, and I love her tremendously. I've told her about how I still feel lonely, and she does her best to try and drive it away. But I still feel so empty, like I'm missing a limb that every other human knows how to use flawlessly.\n\nI lost a lot of weight. I thought that would help me be more confident in myself, right? I lost 45 pounds, and now I'm six foot, 175 pounds, 20-year-old male. Healthy. And I don't think I'm ugly, either. Literally nothing changed. I realize now it doesn't matter if I feel better about myself, because it was never about me. I just wanted to look better for other people. And no \"other person\" is going to say, \"hey, you look good today!\" \n\nI have a friend group. We talk on Discord pretty much every day. We often meet up to play D&amp;D. Each one of those guys is a great friend, and I never would have considered myself the kind of person who could have a friend _group_, let alone a friend. I enjoy every moment I spend with those guys, but it never feels like enough. And we don't meet up in person enough, anyway... just once a month, if we're lucky.\n\nI have hobbies. I play piano. I write. I'm making video games with a bunch of online friends, friends I've had for years. I'm a published playwright. I'm currently working on a brilliant internship that I adore. I'm really into fencing. My D&amp;D group has even started asking me to DM, so I must be doing well. And I feel like I'm not actually socially awkward. If I was, I wouldn't know, obviously, but I think that I can carry on a light conversation with most people.\n\nObserving the facts, objectively, there's no reason I should feel so socially isolated. But I am. I'm always the last person picked for anything, even if I'm skilled at whatever task is needed, I've literally never been asked or invited to do anything even slightly out of the ordinary before, and people *never* talk to me.\n\nThat's it, really, that's the crux of the issue. Even among my friends--who are, truly, my friends, and I'm very lucky to have them--no-one ever starts a conversation with me. No-one will ever go out of their way to talk to me, and I'm just so, _so_, desperate for that. I'm desperate for attention. Which sounds ridiculous. That's why, like, toddlers act out. But it's true, and I don't know what to do about it.\n\nIt must be that desperation that's turning people off. People can just tell that I really want them to pay attention to me, and that turns them away, because it's understandably off-putting. Pathetic, even. But... I don't know. I don't know what to do. I'm not posting here to ask advice, really. I guess I'm just posting here for attention.", "subreddit": "lonely"}

I understand the feeling to a degree but I can't help myself, I feel hurt.\nI gave my everything; countless sleepless nights, many poems, a good amount of kisses and hugs, all the love in my heart and my every last breath of life in myself to make her happy, to help her not commit suicide and at the end I just wasn't enough for her, I wasn't the girl she feel madly in love with, I was just a boy that she used to fill her void, maybe she loved me for a while (an almost three-year long meanwhile). At least she's happier and alive with a good girl, that's something.\nBut I can't deny that I was hopelessly in love, head over heels kind of love. I thought that my path was developing my passions through my love and now I feel that I've lost my path and myself with it.\nMy mind can't stop beating me with that damned phrase as her voice sounds on my head saying it. I can't forget her, her smile, her passions which where similar to mine, and her smile, the true one. I've tried to let her go with my memories of her but they are tied deeply within my soul., maybe because she was my first true friend.\nIf I want to stay alive maybe I just need to suffer with these thoughs until the time comes, I just hope that I can stay sweet, I don't want to grow bitter. I want to love someone as much as I loved her but I don't want to hurt someone for not being her, for the moment my heart is still hers and I can't do anything about it, neither she can, so I'll just wait.\nI just have to live and maybe if I hang long enough on my silver thread somone else, maybe a friend will come, I'll just hold myself as my fingers bleed. I'll try. I wan't to try, I want to stay  here but my body is starting to feel numb, I hope I can stay.\nI hope that the moon shines bright tonight, maybe the gaze of it can alliviate a bit of my pain and give my fingers a bit more strenght.\nGood luck to anyone else whose heart suffers, my best wishes are for them.

Again...", "author": "augcannoli36", "self_text": "There's this guy I had been talking to for a while now and I really really liked him. He lived a little far but I didn't care. Every day I saw him made me so happy. I asked him onto a \"date\" to see the new star wars movie with me. He said yes and that was probably the happiest moment of my life. That is until a few days later he stopped texting me consistently and never talked to me again. I tried getting in contact with him but every time he'd just answer pretty much saying\n\n\"Oh sorry I've been really busy :\\\"\n\nEven though I follow him on social media and see his new posts with all him and all his friends. Also keep in mind he'd only send a text once a day so it'd take a week to finish a conversation... I finally just put my foot down and asked him if he's still seeing the movie with me, in which he replied the same thing he always does\n\n\"Oh sorry i might be busy\" even though before he seemed so excited to see it so it didn't seem likely that he'd just flake.\n\nYes I have realized the fact I clearly did something to scare him away, but everytime I ask he insists I did nothing wrong. I don't buy that for a second but whatever I guess.\n\nSo besides the fact I'm heart broken I scared away the single coolest guy in the entire world and I don't even know what I did wrong. Now i wasted extra money on a second movie ticket and I have nobody else I can see it with. I don't have any friends and my family members are a bunch of batwings. So I guess I'm going to the movies alone... Again........\n\n\n\n\nOn the bright side this movie will probably be so bad that I'll completely forget i was sad", "subreddit": "lonely"}

Sorry for the wall of text.\n\nI don't have a lot of people close to me in my life. I have acquaintances and I think people like me well enough and I like them well enough, but there havent really been any people that I just click with and feel like I can talk about anything with. At the beginning of this year I made an R4R post just saying that I was looking for some sort of connection, friends or whatever, and got a decent amount of responses, but one led to a really close bond that I frankly wasn't even expecting to actually happen when I made the post. We just instantly were able to so easily talk to each other and our personalities meshed so well together and it just felt seamless. Over the 7 months that we got to know each other we really bonded and we quickly fell into a routine where we had long text conversations throughout each day, spoke on the phone every night, and spent most weekends playing games together for somewhere between 5-8 hours most sessions. We became incredibly close and I really felt like I had found someone that I was supposed to find. We never actually met in person because he lived in Europe and I lived in the US, so I was already aware that the likelihood of things working out was probably small and the first few months I kept waiting for the other shoe to drop and him to ghost me, just because that's a common experience I have had with any guy I even slightly connected with where they seem to really like you up front and then, for seemingly no reason, decide to never speak to you again one day. This never happened with him and I began to let myself relax and get attached to him because I knew clicking with someone like this was rare for me and I wanted to pursue it and at least try. \n\nHe was a smart guy, 31 years old, stable job, and I just thought he was mature while also being more emotionally intelligent than I had experienced with other people. I was constantly impressed at how open he was and how eager he was to seriously talk out any issues we had and I just thought he was a really good person who I had truly integrated into my life. Not one day went by where we didn't talk.I leaned on him for emotional support at times and he leaned on me and I was so thankful to have him in my life. He often told me how important I was to him and had told me before that he wasn't going anywhere. \n\nTowards the end of August, he just... stopped speaking to me really. I had graduated college in May and been job searching, and had recently been interviewing for a position that I felt I had a good shot at and he was so supportive of the process and asking me for updates on it and wanting to know all about it/tell him when I knew whether I had gotten the job or not. I thought I was going to get to go through this whole process with him on my side and then one weekend there were a few unanswered texts from me, which hadnt happened before and when I reached out he just told me that he was sorry he dropped off the radar and was dealing with some stuff, which I believed and told him to deal with and not worry about it, focus on himself if he needs a few days or whatever,  He told me he would get something on a specific date out of the way and give me an update. The update never came. I send a couple of short texts just expressing concern over this time and Two weeks later I get:\n\n\"Sorry, honestly not been great. I know I'm off the grid but that's the case for everyone- friends and family too. I don't mean that as an excuse but I do want to emphasize that I'm not singling you out and ghosting you. I hope you're doing really well. I apologize for all of this.\"\n\nThat was the last text he ever intended to send me. I replied to it with concern and asked what was going on, but he never replied back to that, though I could see that he was online many times after that. Finally, end of September I just send him a text saying that I'm really hurt by all of this and that he never even told me properly that he didnt want to speak to me anymore, that I felt tossed to the side with no explanation and he sent me a short formal text just saying he was as forthcoming as he could be and it's not just me, it's everyone. That's the last time I heard from him and I still don't know what happened. \n\nI just wished that I hadn't have let myself get attached to him like I did. I really clicked with him and cared for him and then all of the sudden it was like he didn't want me in his life anymore. It's been over two months and I'm a little better with it now but I'm still so sad that I just lost that person I bonded so well with and told everything to and I don't even know why I lost them, nor did I get a proper goodbye. I find myself wondering what he's up to, if he went on that trip he had planned, etc. and I felt really sad initially that he had kind of become my pillar and I didn't have him around when I went through this life change recently. I got that job and moved to another state where I don't know anyone and I found out right about the same time that he disappeared so I never got to tell him and him disappearing kind of compounded the loneliness that I feel since I don't have anyone here. I just miss him and I wish he hadn't cut me out like that.", "subreddit": "lonely"}

I cant help but realize that he's changed in the best way possible - he's still awkward, but it's charming and funny now. He's found a group of friends to help him come out of his shell a bit more and be more outgoing, and I'm so happy for him. \n\nAs we kept talking, I realized that he's such a great guy, and we still get along so well. I remembered why, years ago, I liked him. I thought something would restart between us, but it turns out he just thinks of me as a cool friend, and even told me about this girl he's talking to. They're probably gonna start dating, and I'm happy for him. \n\nBut I haven't felt this way about a guy since... him. It's never been the same with anyone else. I wish I realized how much I really liked this guy before I broke things off. He really liked me, and I wish I had cherished that more.

We all have lives, literally everyone gets busy. But if you delay a response to someone with consideration and an actual reason, it helps. A handful of people agreed with me when I said that if we just got a little briefing beforehand, it wouldn\u2019t hurt at all. Even freaking afterwards The ignoring doesn\u2019t hurt us, what essentially eats at us is the incessant wondering as to *why* we were ignored in the first place. My point being that communication is key. I honestly don\u2019t care what people think, if we are friends, you OWE me consideration and respect. And the fact that people think wanting a little assurance is entitlement highlights the very problem we are trying to address. Everything is a repeated cycle and the people in the comments who think their own *friends* aren\u2019t entitled to a response are part of the problem. I don\u2019t care about the downvotes \u2014 that post has helped me identify a lot of shitty people. There are people who joined this subreddit just to hate on others, people who aren\u2019t even \u2018lonely\u2019 and just literally want to hate on the people here \u2014 and I was able to locate them. Win-Win situation. If over 500 people can come together and grieve a probability and even pacify each other in a completely serene environment bereft of judgement and prejudice, my purpose is fulfilled. \n\nThis sub is a safe space. Or, it should be. A few people in the comments of that post were telling those who agreed with me to get lives and hobbies. We\u2019re *lonely* people, that is why we are here. If we had these things you speak of, we wouldn\u2019t be posting on this sub, would we? \n\nMy point is, don\u2019t judge other people here. Especially if you don\u2019t relate to their struggles. There are some comments that were made that made me wonder why the user is even *on* this sub. To beat up lonely people? I don\u2019t get it. \n\nAll I have to say is, communicate. That\u2019s literally all it takes. Be a better person. \n\nAnd lastly, if you think that as someone\u2019s friend, you don\u2019t owe them the slightest bit of respect and consideration with your actions. Then I have nothing to say to you. A lot of you seem to think this way, makes me wonder if you would keep the same energy when *you* start getting treated like that. \n\nI will continue posting my struggles as a loner here and whilst criticism is welcome, I will no longer engage it. This is a safe space, not a courtroom, so don\u2019t judge anyone. We\u2019re all here because we need somebody. And as long as I\u2019m able to reach other people like me and we end up feeling better about ourselves, the incentive will remain. \n\nTo each their own. \n\u2014 bronxafrican", "subreddit": "lonely"}

I get why, but that's not important for the story right now...\n\n\nSo for starters: I have an acquaintance, who regularly takes the same bus in the morning as I do. We sometimes chat a little not much, but some time ago something strange happened. She walked up to me and told something along the lines like: \"OH, have I already told you, that one of my friends wants to go on a date with you?\" Since I was still tired and had to get off the bus I just hastely put something together like: \"Tell me later.\" For the whole day I wondered, if I got it right, especially since I didn't know any of her friends, because we know each other just from one club we're both in.\nIt was Tuesday, so it was actually the day the club would meet, so she told me the whole story. \n\nTo understand what follows you need to know, that I've been running for elected office at that time... Before anyone asks it was for a lower house of the city council and I've won my election...\n\nSo because of the ongoing campaign there were some flyers/stickers/social media posts with a more wide spread audience out there with pictures of me on them. So this girl actually walked up to my acquaintance and asked her if she could get her a date with me... Yeah, what was I supposed to say... Since I first thought was, that it was a joke, I told my acquaintance half jockingly to do, what ever she wanted, and that I had nothing better to do anyway. \n\nBut as it turned out, it was not a joke. Only a few hours later she actually send the girl my number. I thought, \"Well..., If I write nothing it will get even weirder\", so we chatted a little. She was not the most attractive girl and had a little confusing style regarding clothing and hair, at least what I could tell from the pictures of her,but I still continued writing her back. \n\nBut after sometime she seemed even weirder than at the start... She seemed not be the most clever person and as I asked her about her friends, she mentioned, that many of her friends were junkies. Yeah... Maybe she just had some in this field and exaggerated it a little. I means I knew, that my acquaintance also hangs around with those people, but is perfectly normal besides that and never touched any drugs herself in her entire life... But after some more time the girl turned out be half  alcoholic herself... Nice... Luckily she seemed to get my hints and stopped texting me the next day, but..\n\nThanks for nothing life, if that's the type of woman I could maybe attract, maybe it's better to stay FA.", "subreddit": "ForeverAlone"}

So it's not impossible to get a girlfriend but definitely harder.  I tried to explain to her I am just realistic about my looks and also that I learned a long time ago that women who are interested make an effort to get to know you/date you.  A woman who is interested also isn't going to be too busy, not be looking for anything serious, etc.  In high school women showered me with compliments (even some telling me how I'm great boyfriend material but not with them of course).

A lonely guy. A PAINFULLY lonely guy. What i want in life more than anything is to have a genuine connection with a woman and to be in love.\n\nI have bad coping mechanizes. One of them is to seek out sexual behavior online. I'm lonely, and I don't want to be alone. So when I'm talking to someone part of me wants to behave sexually because its a connection, a painfully shallow connection but its more than Ive got. I want a hug, more than anything in the whole world, but online sexual talk is the closest i can get to a damn hug.\n\nHere is the thing though, that doesn't mean I don't care. I hate that attitude. I make it a point to be respectful, honest, and upfront about my issues. When I listen to someone elses, its because I care. I know what its like to have no one care, and I want to be there for this other person I'm talking to. Me wanting something sexual doesn't change that. There have been time when people opened up to me about stuff where I just said to myself \"this isn't the time\" and didn't pursue anything remotly sexual with them because i really and truely cared about this other person, even if i just met them. There have been times where people said they had a BF and so I didn't pursue anything sexual, cause that would have been wrong. There have been times when people opened up about rape, or abuse, or just other issues that they needed to talk about and it would have been wildly inappropriate to try to be flirty or sexual. \n\nI wanted to be sexual with every one of those women. I messaged them because I was lonely, they were lonely, and I thought maybe we could be open with each other, talk about our stuff, and be sexual somewhere in the middle of all of that. maybe we could both feel a little less lonely. That doesn't negate the fact that I cared and actually wanted to be their for them. It doesn't mean i'm some manipulator or something. I don't push, guilt, or anything like that. \n\n\u200b\n\nwanting to be sexual doesn't mean im feigning interest.

And so far in my 19 years, I have not found a girlfriend in all of my years of high school (or in my first year of college).

I almost had one in senior year since we enjoyed the same stuff (like music, TV, movies, etc), and the only difference that we had was our religious beliefs/disbelief (She was a Christian).\n\nBut I think why I failed with her was because I asked her if we could become BF and GF. She said \"She'll think about it\", and this was near the end of the year, as we've bonded together in art class throughout it. But afterwards, she pretty dismissed my question, and from looking at her Snapchat (yes, I have her Snapcode and she has mine), it looks like she already found a guy that was probably more suitable for her. \n\nSo, yeah, I probably came too quick with the romantic advances. I don't blame her. It's my fault for not initially knowing when a girl actually loves me and when a girl is just being a great friend to me. Ever since then, I haven't gotten lucky with a girl at all. Just mutual relationships.\n\nWhile I do have Asperger's, I improved my social skills and I have several friends (with some girls, as well).

Lately, I have just been sad and feeling really lonely, romantically. Its just so hard when the people who surround me are getting married, growing their families or going on trips with their SO's. I feel lonely not going on dates, spending time with that special someone, and most importantly, the *lack of time spent being* ***little spoon.*** Since a very young age, I have been a hopeless romantic, and it hurts me to feel like I am not good enough for anybody. It hella hurts my ego. Being single makes me feel like I am not handsome enough, like my personality is trash, idk.. like my hard work in school/work/other life ventures goes unnoticed. I guess I just crave having that PERSON romantically who is a best friend. it is just so cute to me. I always dream about cuddles/traveling/inside jokes/ just being in a relationship with a person that I can GROW with. \n\nWhat I don't understand is why I feel like Im not given a fair shot in the dating pool. I go to a four yearUniversity of California, I am ambitious, not only with school, I work and have a job. I am pursuing a music career and a I have 200 thousand streams worldwide with my music. I eventually want to go to grad school and get my masters. I lead a bible study, and I am very intentional with my relationships, often trying to put myself in positions of mentorship to others. I would like to think of myself as caring. I just don't know what I can do different. I am ready to give off my love and receive it also. Im tired of hearing  \"You have to be happy with yourself before you can be in a relationship\" or \"you just have to wait\" or \" it comes when you least expect it\" lol. I feel like if I am too passive with dating then nothing will happen. I am content with myself, but of course it would be nice to pour into someone and get poured into romantically.\n\nSo I don't know. It hurts and I get lonely. I often think of what the hell is wrong with me. Is there something wrong with my personality? Am I just not good looking? Am I not enough (even sometimes) These are things that often cross my mind when I think about singleness.   \n\n\nSorry yall. just had to get this off my mind.

I've joined this just 5 minutes ago because I think I could express myself to everyone who has been or is in the same boat.\n\nI've only talked to two females throughout my lonely life (20 years of age). The first one was a bit of a mistake because she was talking to other males whilst in the midst of talking to me, which resulted in me giving up on her. An obvious choice right? But the second female, we'll call her... Annabelle *for the sake of privacy and respect* We met on Runescape, a popular mmo that I'm sure many of you know and or heard of. We started talking on discord and eventually deepened our relationship, but not that of an actual boyfriend and girlfriend relationship but pretty close. My experience with that type of relationship was none. Cause you know, I've been 100% alone up until this point. Sometimes I felt a bit insecure, anxious and jealous. Feeling like I wasn't contributing during much to what we had, but I was keeping my chin up. She's a sweet and kind girl, who gave up her time to talk to a lame person like me. Not thinking rationally I made the mistake of being too clingy on multiple occasions. And that turned out to be a very very bad move. We stopped talking and were only talking a tiny bit about a month apart a couple of times. Now I feel that its sunken down to that of just friends. We've started to play Xbox with each other, not too frequently. It's fun spending the time with her doing something we both enjoy. Of course I dont know how she feels, but I know for certain that I still love her. Things may stay the same forever or can sprout into something. All I know is...

If anyone is going through or went through something similar I\u2019d love to hear about it.\n\nI was very close with like 4 or 5 friends in high school especially by junior and senior year. We would always have a really good time together even if we had nothing to really do. All of my close friends are very very smart guys and we always would have just very genuinely interesting and open conversations about anything. And we went to a private school so everyone went into it not really knowing anyone like the freshman year of college. However, I immediately had 2 very good friends right off the bat in high school. I mean I generally consider myself a social person. I really like talking to people that I like and I\u2019m actually not bad at meeting people I feel. \n\nMy roommate and I went to high school together but we weren\u2019t really super good friends and we go to a college that\u2019s 10 hours from our home state so coming in we pretty much only knew eachother. The first week was fun because I got to meet and talk to a lot of new people but once everything settled down it just became harder to meet people. And even the people I met I just didn\u2019t really connect with. I just haven\u2019t been clicking with anyone compared to how it was in high school. And it was the same for my roommate but he\u2019s remarkably less social than me. He\u2019s a good roommate and an alright dude but he\u2019s just very bland and doesn\u2019t have much to say about anything compared to the people I\u2019m used to talking to. But after weeks and weeks went by and we still couldn\u2019t really find any other friends it was kinda clear that it\u2019s just me and him. It wasn\u2019t horrible at first in hindsight. We\u2019d play madden and other stuff together and go to the football games,go to the bars occasionally, and watch football or whatever on tv. He really spends a ton of time alone and he likes it that way I guess but he eats alone, just stays in his room the whole time if he\u2019s in the dorm. My family always ate dinner together and I never really spent much time in my room at home besides sleeping because I\u2019d always like to go and talk to my parents. \n\nAbout a month ago my roommate got a girl friend. Since he got the girlfriend he doesn\u2019t hang out with me at all for the most part even if he isn\u2019t with her so I\u2019ve been in mostly complete social isolation with occasionally speaking to my roommate. I have acquaintances and stuff from my classes but not anyone I know super well. On top of that due to an administrative error I was unable to take any course pertaining to my major this semester so I\u2019m just in classes with people who have many different majors. I would get dinner with 2 kids from one of my classes after we had class sometimes but they\u2019re both from this state so they kinda had a lot of friends already I mean I guess I should\u2019ve asked to hangout or something at some point but I\u2019m always afraid people will think I\u2019m annoying or something and like I was afraid to lose some of my only human contact. \n\nMy roommate\u2019s girlfriend is pretty nice I guess but she talks about sex a ton and I\u2019m a virgin so it just kinda makes me not really have anything to contribute whenever she\u2019s over with her friends or whatever. I mean I\u2019m pretty sensitive because it kinda stings being an almost 19 year old male virgin in college and so I just kinda shut down when she starts talking about it which is a large portion of a conversation with her. Also, my roommate told her and her friend I was a virgin when we were hanging out with them and it was the first time any of us had ever met eachother including my roommate meeting her and I could literally count on one hand how many people I\u2019ve told that I was a virgin. I mean it wasn\u2019t his fault completely because I started laughing during one of my roommates future girlfriend\u2019s sex stories and so her friend goes \u201cAre you a virgin\u201d and I told her no and then she asks my roommate who was very drunk and he told her that I was and I went to a very dark place that night after that. I literally couldn\u2019t talk to any of them anymore and just got up and went to bed after a while and I had also been drinking so it felt like I had been hit by a truck. I felt so low. \n\nI guess maybe college has been the loneliest point of my life so far and I\u2019ve had some serious issues with anxiety and depression because of this loneliness. I smoke a lot of weed because it lets me not feel so bad about how little I talk to people but I still have very good grades. I know it isn\u2019t a good way to deal with it but I really feel like if I didn\u2019t smoke at least a few times a week it gets really bad especially since the stretches between when I can go home are like months. I don\u2019t really smoke that much if at all at home and I don\u2019t really feel the need to there like I do in college.  I don\u2019t think most  people were meant to have such low levels of social interaction. Nearly everyone I meet feels very artificial and shallow with nothing interesting to say. Yet it seems like they\u2019re all having a much better time than me.\n\nNow before anyone tells me I did join a club and I like the kids in it and stuff but the meetings are only weekly and no one really hangs out outside of the club. That\u2019s actually one of the main issues with our club that our new president is trying to fix. I\u2019ll probably join a few more or rush a fraternity in the spring.", "subreddit": "lonely"}

{"post_id": "e8stxx", "created_utc": 1575995265, "title": "Don't be so hard on yourself", "author": "Cliff_Clavin_Postman", "self_text": "Hi everyone,\n\nI want to dedicate this post mainly to high-achieving FAs like myself. FAs who, at every single point in time, have made the best decision they possibly can. I'll give myself as an example, keeping it as short as possible.\n\nI was born in a 3rd world country to narcissistic parents, and I was rarely allowed to leave the house. I hated my childhood, and I hated how lonely I was. I did the best I could in my situation, and I worked my ass off to get out of the country and out of my parents' house (in my country, people can be stuck with their parents forever due to costs of living). And I succeeded, getting into a top school with a scholarship and graduating in a very good field job-wise that I like. I also, throughout the years, have made a lot of friends in my home country and here where I live today and they've been immensely helpful on my journey. That said, since I'm posting here, I haven't made that much progress on escaping FA and having a love life, despite countless rejections and very, very meager \"successes\" that are not proportionate to how much effort I've put in. But I have a lot of self-improvement plans I finally have time now to do and even though I'm not sure if they will pay off or not, I will at least know that I've done my best.\n\nSpeaking of doing your best, this is what my post is aiming at: if you've done your best and don't have any regrets about anything you've done, then please please stop being hard on yourself regarding your FA situation. Speaking for myself (but I'm sure that it can apply to a lot of you as well), I was already born with a shit-ton of disadvantages. Lack of money, lack of citizenship (which I still don't have, but working hard towards it), narcissistic parents that locked me inside the house and rarely showed any affection. Which, by the way is the worst combination, since they're not letting me get affection and support from them AND they're not letting me develop the social skills needed to find a SO to get that emotional support from. Being average height, average-looking (which is only a problem because of what I just mentioned). Craving affection because I can't get it, which I don't consciously show, but I might be subconsciously showing, etc. The list can go on. There's so much that I would have changed about what I was born with if given the chance.\n\nBut you know what? With what I've been given, I've achieved so much. I really have, and I'm so proud of myself, and if anyone here shares a similar situation, then you should be as well. For a while, I was beating myself over being FA, thinking self-depreciating thoughts, thinking that I was beneath all my friends who had SOs and weren't FA. But the thing is, why should I beat myself over something that is out of my hands? I'm not responsible for my shitty upbringing that led me to being FA, and I've done everything in my power at the moment to change that, and I still have a plan for improving my situation and trying to fix whatever I can fix when I get the chance. Beating myself up and thinking I'm not masculine enough for getting a SO is akin to a guy who isn't fertile and can't impregnate his wife and thinking the same thing. I mean, really, in both cases, it's not our fault. It's a \"condition\" (for lack of a better term) we were born with, and in my case, raised with. The best we can do is just to do our best to tackle the problem and fix it. We might succeed or we might not, but regardless, we are not at fault here. We are not \"less\" than people we know who have SOs. They didn't have our genetics or our upbringing, so there really is no point to compare.\n\nNow, I know some of the FAs here are NEET due to being FA, and I realize that for some, the fight is too much. Personally, I know the fight would be too much for me as well if I wasn't on antidepressants. So I understand that it could be difficult, but do your best to stop being a NEET because it's the first step if you were to ever escape being FA.\n\nAnyways, hope this helps someone out there who used to beat himself up over feeling emasculated and beneath their friends, etc. over something that I didn't choose, and who the other people who aren't FA most likely didn't \"work\" for. Just do your best. You're not at fault here.", "subreddit": "ForeverAlone"}

I have one very close friend (like a brother) who shares my interest is and currently working with me to start our farm in the spring. \n\nBasically I think the lack of meaningful social connection is a result of returning to nature, the countryside, and leaving city and university life (and inadvertently all young people) behind. Farming is a full time job and you are married to the land. As someone who came from an upper-middle class family in the suburbs, this radical life change has quite literally left me in the darkest place of my life.\n\nWhile I\u2019m working towards my goal of providing people with quality local food, and rebuilding our over-tilled, chemical-laden dying soil, I\u2019m lacking the basic human social connections to feel happy in day-to-day life. The average age of the farmer keeps getting older and the younger generations are not interested in hard farm work. This trend is crushing my morale. \n\nThe culture is so polarized... and I\u2019m someone who falls inbetween. I\u2019m not hardcore religious, so I can\u2019t fit into those exclusive groups (I worship nature and my ancestors, which is perceived as satanism) and I really don\u2019t enjoy mindless drinking on the weekends with superficial people. Not judging, just my experience.\n\nNo one seems to give a fuck about the people that put food on their plates. And as a young person, this lifestyle couldn\u2019t be more rewarding and isolating at the same time. I\u2019ve noticed this problem has begun to take a severe toll on my mental and physical health... I greatly fear the challenge of finding a significant other who shares interest in the lifestyle.\n\nI\u2019ve made the closest connections in my travels abroad, but they are finite as I must return to the farm. It makes no sense to return to university because I\u2019ve been presented with an outstanding opportunity to manage land with the skills that I already have from independent work/study. \n\nI think I may be better off accepting this, than fearing and suffering the never ending loneliness.", "subreddit": "lonely"}

After three days, I\u2019m the most interactive anon on her CC and we\u2019ve had several deep conversations there. The connection was so clear to see, that at several points she would tweet things like \u201cWaiting for this boy to pop up in my cc before I go to bed\u201d or this one time where she said \u201ccontemplating deleting twitter but i want to stay just so i can interact with this 3am kid\u201d ( I made a habit out of frequently leaving messages at 3AM. I\u2019m an insomniac, don\u2019t question.) One day, she literally begs me to reveal my identity. I remember it verbatim. She says she\u2019s already way too invested in me and interested for me to remain anonymous, and she wouldn\u2019t dare like an anonymous person. At one point she assured me she won\u2019t switch up when I do reveal myself, and I finally budge. Typically, immediately after I reveal myself it\u2019s like the spark just dies. After exactly four hours, she stops responding to my texts and after a day, she *blocks* me. Till today, I don\u2019t know what the devil I did wrong, you know. \n\nShe went from calling me all the mush in the world, from setting literal alarms for my messages to airing me like the plague. \n\nSometimes I think about it and it hurts, because not often have I ever connected with someone that quickly and deeply before. \n\nWhat about you lot though?

Someone suggested I make a post about it and I thought it was definitely a good idea to make a review about my experience. I do know that some people here would never pay for any kind of intimacy with a girl which is completely fair, but I assume that there are also guys like me who see nothing wrong with it and wouldn't mind doing it as a one-time thing for example hence this post. \n\nAnyway, it wasn't my first time paying for intimacy as I had already seen an escort prior to that. It was a decent experience, but nothing more and definitely not something I would recommend. In general, I think that going from never touching a girl in your life to getting naked with a woman you don't know and jumping straight up to sex isn't going to be a very good experience for most guys. \n\nSo the second time, I looked for an escort that provided GFE services. This time I wasn't looking for sex, just basic physical touch and skin to skin contact. I wanted to cuddle with a girl, snuggle, hold hands while maintaining eye contact, caress her, stroke her hair, having her head rest on me and vice versa. \n\nAmazingly, there are hundred of women who provide that kind of services where I live and the one I saw definitely delivered. I picked her because her website was well done and because she seemed to offer what I was looking for. There wasn't any photo of her face on her website so I definitely lucked out as she was absolutely beautiful. \n\nI contacted her using this [post](https://np.reddit.com/r/SexWorkers/comments/do4q59/a_perfect_example_of_how_to_message_a_provider/) as a model. Setting up an appointment with her was very easy and I only briefly mentioned how I would like to spend my time with her to which she told me that she was completely fine with it. Seeing her was a bit more complicated as she cancelled our first appointment because of an emergency, but we did reschedule a few days later and I got to see her this time. \n\nThe whole thing cost me 200\u20ac ($220) for an hour at her place so it's definitely very expensive, but in my case it was completely worth it. The actual experience was incredible and simply thinking about it makes me a bit nostalgic. I got to experience everything I wanted and I felt comfortable the whole time. Looking back at it, I obviously know that the only reason she spent time with me was because she was getting paid, but while it was happening this wasn't a concern at all. I was too busy enjoying the moment and all those new sensations that I was experiencing. \n\nThe only slightly awkward moments where at the start before we moved to her bed and at the end when she ended the session. The former because I'm always a bit embarrassed when I meet someone for the first time and the latter because it was an abrupt return to reality. Other than that it was simply perfect and after the first few minutes it felt very natural for me to take the lead about what I wanted to do. We even got to talk a bit while snuggling which was great. \n\nAs for the practical: I was naked and she only kept her underwear. I only got an erection at the start. My favorite moment was when I rested my head on her chest while she gently stroked my hair, I stayed like that for probably close to ten minutes. I wasn't disappointed at all that it didn't get sexual as it wasn't what I was looking for.  \n\nOverall I have zero regrets although the next few days were quite hard mentally as I was back to reality and now fully realizing what I'm missing on a daily basis. I assume it's similar to what people in prison for a long time feel like when they get a one-day temporary release where they experience being free again for a few hours and then they are back to jail. \n\nFor this reason, I wouldn't recommend the experience to everyone. As I said, it's expensive and hits you hard once it's over so I would only recommend it to people who can afford it and are ready to face the afterwards. It may have been the best sixty minutes of my life, but it certainly didn't change my situation or how I feel in general about being alive. \n\nStill, it was a nice sunshine in an otherwise shitty life and I would have no problem about doing it again in the future. Not before a while though, as it's not something I could afford more than one or two times a year.

Sadly, this wasn't the first time something like this has happened. The horrible realisation quickly sets in when my brain reminds me that I'm still alone, and with every passing year, it looks ever more likely I will never experience what a relationship is like, or how wonderful it must feel for someone of the opposite sex to have mutual feelings for you (or the same sex depending on your sexual preference). Sex would just be a nice bonus.\n\nGetting older isn't making it any easier and I'm 28 now. I struggle to even make meaningful connections with other guys, let alone trying to get the interest of females. Talk about a red flag if a girl sees a guy who has no friends or a barely fuctioning social circle. If a girl showed any interest in me now, I wouldn't even notice as my self-esteem is so low and I would just think they feel sorry for me or are only doing small talk. \n\nI've only had bad experiences when it comes to girls. I've had my heart broken a few times and although it's really stupid to let it hang over me for such a long time, I'm still sort of hung up on a girl I was really into during my high school days. I guess it was because she was my first love of sorts and she's still the only girl I've ever asked out. Of course, she rejected me in front of a bunch of people so that probably messed me up a fair bit going forward. Sorry for the pity story.\n\nWhen I see other couples, I don't feel resentment or anger or even jealousy, all I feel is sadness because it's like gazing into a world I know I'll most likely never be a part of. It would be nice to have someone to go to the cinema with, or buy a birthday present for, or message them to see how they are doing. We have a cat and he helps combat the void of emptiness and depression but it's still not quite the same as having the affection of another person. That's not to say a relationship would fix my ever crumbling mental health, I've been going through it for nearly five years now and I'm not sure I will ever get out of it really.

I know I'm a sensitive person and I've tried changing that but it's tough, it's in my nature and it's hard to change. I guess I was a pessimistic person even before my depression hit.

So in this post im going to take a deeper dive in what  got me out of my years of singleness. Hopefully this can help someone.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Where was I going wrong?**\n\nThis took me a long time to figure out. I was a pretty nice guy. I could make people laugh, and it seemed i was able to befriend girls too. I wasn't the best looking guy around, but a lot of dudes in relationships arent either.  So what gives?  I would get rejected time and time again by girls i thought i was cool with.  So here was my first mistake, I was waaaay to forward early on.  I went in guns blazing. I would literally just ask a girl out just kinda out of the blue and sort of unnaturally. It would be girls i kinda knew but didnt have much of a connection with.  Unless you're some type of coochie slayer i would never advise this.  My second mistake, during the process of just talking i was being way too nice. I would over compliment them. volunteer to do shit for them all the time and was just being too much of a push over for them. I was kinda being a white knight in other terms.  Now, there's nothing wrong with complimenting them, matter of fact thats a good thing. helps you gauge and test the waters before jumping in.  However like everything else, too much a good thing is bad.  When you compliment them all the time and overly gratify them you're essentially letting them know they have more power over you.  Girls get off to just knowing guys want them.  If they feel like they know they can get you then the ball is entirely in their court(which it is from the start but you cant let them know that)  My 3rd mistake. I dressed like a total moron. I wore clothes way too big for me, things that did not match, and just and odd sense of fashion. I never dressed like swaglord but i found what looked good on me from feedback from friends. ( you can never go wrong with button downs and jeans) Now my last mistake.... I had a negative mindset. The fact i blamed my rejections on external things and blamed circumstances instead of what i was doing wrong.  For example,  I would blame the fact that maybe i wasn't what the rejector was looking for, or my poor genetics, my acne(which lasted through college), etc.  I would tell myself i wasn't good enough or i couldn't do it.  after years and years of being told no it really hurts your self esteem, but you have to get out of that mindset. If you accept the fact that you cant do something then you never will.  Your actions will reflect your subconscious.  I know, its a LOT easier said than done, but you have to just believe you can do it.  Trust me, you can.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Ok, so how do i actually talk to them or approach them?**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\~build up approach\n\nWell this could vary in a million different ways for the sake of consistency lets just say theres a girl from work or school you know.  In my experience, It's always best to actually have a reason to talk to them so the conversation feels as natural as possible.( convos feeling natural is the most important thing. forced conversations are always awkward) I get it it though, You may not have a particular reason to talk to them, so apply this when applicable.  If you can't try to talk about something topical with them. maybe an assignment a work project etc.  After you do that try to talk more about yourself and see if you two have any common interests.  Next time you talk to them it wont feel as unnatural.   Before you know it you'll be more acquainted with this person.   So lets say you and this said girl mutually feel pretty comfortable around each other.  Try to hangout with her in some sort of friend/ coworker group.(like everyone going to lunch together for example) This is a good way to introduce the idea of you two seeing each other outside work/school.  try to do this a few times. if you make it to this point you should feel pretty confident to ask her to lunch one on one(not a date just hanging out)  Prior to this point, the conversations you two have are more than likely pretty surface level.  If she agrees to going to lunch with you this would be a good time to open up a bit more about yourself than earlier. Try being a little more flirty and carefully gauge her body language.  Try doing the one on one lunches a couple of more times.  if this goes well see if she'll be willing to go out on an actual date with you. I coin this the build up approach. it's a natural less forward way of getting to know someone to the point of asking them out.  This is where i had the most success( and my friends too)  I will say you can do a variation of this too.  Maybe you're introduced to a person through a family member or friend.  just go through these steps the same way.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**How did i meet my current gf?**\n\ni meet my current gf in church.  she started attending  because she was friends with my cousin. well i became cool with her on a pretty surface level.(Just friends). One day  the church got together to go to a burger joint and she attended.  while we were in line i noticed she was wearing a harry potter shirt on. so my flirty ass was like \" i like your shirt, so are you a wizard?  because i think i'm under your spell\" I said this in playful joking type of manner but it worked she started giggling and didn't  know what to say.  that whole night we just talked and everything went great. we kissed at the end of the night and started dating  a month or so later. Sometimes you gotta just roll the dice. my flirt could have very well landed flat.  I was in relationships before but they all were short term. (ive been shot down probably over a hundred times in my life oppose to the 4 or 5 times i wasn't)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Warnings and things to consider**\n\nWhile in the process of talking to women you need to be careful. some women are cruel and  will just use you. just because you end up getting a gf doesn't mean she will be a good one(my first gf cheated on me with my friend).  Just be cautious out there. the pain of getting hurt by a woman is far greater than loneliness.  If you two are just talking and not dating watch out for competition. they're out there. also sometimes women will text you out of the blue after showing signs of disinterest or rejecting you e weary they just be looking for easy attention. Also  if you are successful and get your first gf... here's a warning. Its probably not going to last. with it being your first relationship, you're bound to make mistakes or date the wrong person. It literally happens to 98% of everyone. You'll get your heart broken and will experience pain of the loss of love.  But you know what? you'll learn from it, remember the good times and move on, and become a stronger person....... or maybe your first one will be your only one. it can happen.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Afterword**\n\nThe game of love is sophisticated. You'll lose a lot, but the wins are reason why we play.  They're so worth it. I know it may be hard to feel confident in our self, but you have to try and keep making shots. Take the time to learn where you're going wrong and just dont blame it all on your looks.  Its mostly in  your personality and your approach. I know this may not help everyone but i hope It can help someone.  As I said in my first post, I truly know what its like to be alone for years. didnt get my first gf till i was 22 and out of college. I know thats not as bad as some, but I see theres a lot of young guys here who are making the same mistakes i made and are struggling.  I wish someone  would have just slapped me and told me where i was going wrong, but i had to find that out myself.  Feel free to AMA and i hope this clears up the ambiguity of my first post. Again i Hope this helps someone.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow go get em tiger.", "subreddit": "ForeverAlone"}

I'm still looking for advice.  \n\n\n It's quite long since it spans about eight years, but I'll try to be brief.   \n \n\nI  have this friend that I met in college. My school experience was downright abominable, so I started latching on this new social circle  and the first years went well, all things considered. Still, I've had my  fair share of faults and my depressions acted up in those years. I have attempted suicide twice and this friend that was sort of \"the leader\"   of the group, was the first person outside of my family that I spoke about this. It was and still is a very touchy subject for me, but, back then, I valued this kindness. The other one stuck with me and I thought  the world of him, as well.  \n Until,  years, later, he mocked me for it. He used the most traumatic  event of my life to make me feel like shit and then ditched me the  moment I tried  to call him and at least talk about this stuff.  Literally sent me a  text where he said \"we didn't work out\" and  basically ghosted me. I've tried to talk to my other friend, the first one, and others of my social circle in the hopes to have at least  someone stick with me, and see my side of things, but alas, it didn't  work out. Slowly but surely, I was ostracized. The one thing that made  me swear off everyone else was the time I saw on Facebook the photo of a  graduation party I wasn't invited to. My two former friends were there.  I talked with the graduate that  basically told me she didn't want to  make a fuss, so she called the other guy instead. That was the moment I  decided to cut ties with every  one of that social circle.  \n I  wanted to give one last chance to my other friend because I thought he was better.  He once said to me that he was on my side and we'd still  be hanging out. It was a lie: If there was a thing I cared about in the  world was watching the new Star Wars movie (It was The Force Awakens,  to give you an idea of the time frame) with my friend. They all went to  see it on the first day without inviting me...But inviting *him*.  \n I  talked with the offending friend when he finally tried to make amends a  year later, and I accepted his apology, even though, in my heart,   things had changed. He left town for another college and I haven't heard from him since. Nor do I want to.  \n The  other one is on thin ice. I didn't forgive him for his cowardice and the fact that he lied to my face, only receiving a half-assed apology.  It was like he had no idea why he did me wrong no matter how much I've explained it to him. We are civil to each other, but I don't particularly care for him. I haven't in all the time that happened no  matter how many souls searching I did, nor did I forget his indifference.  He once said \"That's how things work in social circles\": I  still think  it was bullshit.  \n My first friend,  the one that I met, and I are aspiring writers.  I've written a few pieces for the theatre, while he works in commercial, and wants to expand to television. Despite involving me in several failed  projects  (I'm no Hemingway, but every idea he had and insisted on never  stuck to the landing, mostly because he's repetitive and trashy. So am  I, but in a  different way.) he never once tried involving me with the  \"right crowd\", the people that \"matter\" if you catch my drift. We don't  talk much and I try to keep my distances since he feels like a dead end.    Until recently: We've started working on a web serial with another  writer, and so far it's been miserable. He has no idea how to direct a   project, the story is even trashier than before, I feel my creativity constantly stifled, not to mention he's never satisfied with anyone's writing, including his own. I've hated this project ever since it started and I'm trying to finish it as fast as I can. Still, I don't know what I will do after this. If it has success, we may be stuck,   working together once again. If it doesn't, I'll be left on my own,   while he tries, again and again, leaving me behind.  \n I have no idea what to do, except wallow in my resentment.", "subreddit": "lonely"}

Even to me I'm boring, I guess.\n\nSince I'm not good with dealing with other people, chose to work from home thinking that would help but it didn't either.

Its not sunshine and rainbows, people are assholes and even the people who are \"nice\" can be assholes too. Very few are truly good. Its a tough world and i understand why we are all lonely, its not always your fault like alot of normies claim it to be. \n\nTruth is human beings like to shit on the weak and the poor. The ones with high status want to put them down, only very few rare people that are high status are willing to help. Kids can get bullied in school for no reason, they can be mocked and laughed at for not be socially adequate or smart in class. Normal people like to boast about this and that on social media like \"live love and laugh\" but then they treat people who are FA like, like garbage. \n\nIn highschool, i was a quiet kid but sometimes id initiate conversations. Everyone made fun of me for being dumb, everyone mocked me, the teacher laughed with them. One day we were discussing a book called the lord of the flies, the teacher asked question; the question was who would be the first one to die of we were all stuck on an island? Guess what.. they all chose me. One kid said i would be dumb and try to swim off the island then drown. I laughed it off.. but inside it killed me. The teacher smirked and did nothing, the students laughed. Keep in mind these are the people who say shit like \"judt be cpnfidance bro\".\nAnyways long story short its a shit world.\n\nNow on to the advice. First of all nothing is guaranteed in life and may be alone forever however the best advice i can give is that no matter how hard life is. We cant give up. as someone who got rejected so many times, as someone who bullied by so many kids when i was young. Along with being raised with strict parents who judge me alot. I know that everything is harder but i just cant fathom to give up and not try because maybe i will miss a chance. Maybe there was someone thwre but i missed out. I know the chances are slim but the reason we are still living is because we are afraid that we will lose that one chance to redeem ourself and to find someone. Give it your all to find someone because at the end of the day, this life cant be repeated. The chances may be small and u might be alone ur whole life and maybe u wont. You never completely know until life is over. Talk to people, socialize, join clubs, talk to people at work or college. Whatever it takes. I know its easier said than done but just take it easy and one step at a time. Take breaks, i know its exhausting mentally but then try again.\n\nP.S i m typing on my phone so sorry if my grammar is trash, im not handing in an essay that i have the need to edit this shit lol. \n\nBut ywa i hope you guys can atleast take something away from this and live this life.", "subreddit": "ForeverAlone"}

Sorry that\u2019s utter nonsense. \nNext year I\u2019m going to start dating seriously and I don\u2019t care if anyone doesn\u2019t approve of my past, if a women does then move on.\n\nI know this will get negative karma. I wish you would believe in yourselves. Nobody will come and rescue you, you need to do it. I will continue to post on here and will offer as much help and guidance as possible. If you don\u2019t believe what I say about women. Do one thing.\nSit in a busy coffee shop or at a mall/train station etc. People watch, have a good hard look at how people look. Not everyone looks like a chad, not everyone is super fit or confident. You just need to put yourself out there. \n\nPlease believe in yourself, for twenty years I didn\u2019t.

I guess it's kinda a rant with a bunch of problems I'm facing. My first semester of university has ended. I made no friends, and as a result have no friends. \n\nThere was a girl I talked a lot with, we used to walk to the bus together, we sat next to each other. We shared a lot of interests, and she was pretty shy which I guess I was sympathetic towards. Anyway, I asked her out for coffee and she accepted, we spend 2 hours there talking and I think it went alright. I guess at the time I kinda thought of it as a date while she did not. I then ask her if I could \"take her out\" to see a movie and she says she is too busy, essentially rejecting me. Afterwards she seemed to be kinda avoiding me, so I essentially told her about my intentions, and that I really did not mean much by asking her. I also told her I had Asperger meaning I struggle with these things. We then agree to be friends and things kinda go back to how they were. \n\nIt's now the end of the semester and I texted her a bit about exams but it kinda evolved into a conversation. She seemed to reply quickly and with long responses. I then friend her on snap-chat, and thank her, but she does not reply to my text. She also kinda ended our other conversation quite early, and maybe I'm overthinking this but I feel like shes kinda avoiding me. My current theory is that she really only saw the friendship out of convention due to being in class together and did not want much more than that. I'm really not sure though, I don't really understand people. I am used to being ghosted and having friendships not last long but it still hurts none the less because I now have no friends over Christmas break. Maybe I'm overthinking this though and should just text her being honest and asking her what her intentions are. She told me shes socially awkward herself so maybe it's just that, I dunno.\n\nAnyway, that was a long tangent but right now I don't have any friends, and even if she did want to be, she's leaving for the break I couldn't really do much with her anyway. \n\nI am seeking therapy, due to my problems with loneliness and having Asperger for the first time over the break so maybe I can sort things out there. But In the mean time I'm not really sure what to do. I feel unproductive and useless sitting around on my computer all day playing video games and watching YouTube. I could get a job but it would be inconvenient and I imagine I'd hate working in retail. I used to have hobbies, mainly involving game design, 3d animation etc, but I kinda ran out of time for them thanks to school. I also never really enjoyed them that much as I always found them frustrating. Besides, I'd still be sitting on my computer all day. Its not so much that I'm bored, but I feel lazy and unproductive, I'm not really doing anything with my time. I used to exercise a reasonable amount but school kinda got me out of the routine, and I could do that again, which might help.", "subreddit": "lonely"}

But no, I'm asking in as serious manner. I think it goes without saying that FAs don't have girlfriends to have sex with so our only form of carnal release is either jacking-off or hiring a prostitute. \n\nRegarding the former: I have several questions. \n\n- How often do you guys fap?\n- What do you usually fap to? What genre, image, or concept?\n\nReason I ask this is because now as a 24-yr old kissless virgin, I feel myself \"burning out\" on masturbation. In many way I burned out a long time ago. It's no longer fun or pleasurable. It does nothing for me.\n\nAnd it's harder and harder to do (pun, kind of?). Anytime I watch anything remotely \"sexual\" meant to stimulate my hormones and arouse me...my mind just drifts into negative thoughts. Negative thoughts like \"that will never be me\" and \"look how interesting this activity looks. Everyone has done it...except you\".\n\nSo yeah, pretty much any \"porn\" is off the table. Watching people have sex makes me think negative thoughts about how I'm not having it, haven't had it, and don't see myself having it anytime soon. \n\nI can't even fap to standard pictures of naked women or something because my head immediately yells at me \"you've never had a woman get naked in front of you. No woman will ever trust you with her nakedness and let you make love to her\"\n\nStuff like that. Curious to explore. The same extends to pretty much ANYTHING nowadays. All that mainstream music on the radio about breakups and crushes? It's foreign language to me. All those ads on television about Christmas with your partner? Kissing your girlfriend on New Years? Memes about love and sex and relationships. It's all just...black noise. I can't relate to any of it. I feel like an alien because these integral human emotions of lust, romance, sexuality, and desire are completely unknown to me. I can hardly watch television because every show has a romance sub-plot and I have to skip through those scenes because it's like watching two aliens communicate in a foreign language.

I also sound like a chick on the phone and am completely incapable of growing facial hair or looking masculine in any way, really.  Suffice to say, I've never been shown interest by females and most regular folks see me as too eccentric to hang out with, even as friends.\n\nDespite all this, I acknowledge that each of these issues is not my fault.  I am not to blame for my genetics so I don't hate myself for any of these issues.  It's hard for me to blame women for rejecting me either - I know that good looks and social proficiency are important to women so it makes sense that they would reject me - I would too if I was them.  But that doesn't mean I feel like I don't have any worth based on that.\n\nI do have a pretty successful career, but I wouldn't say that is because I am signficantly smarter than anyone else here.  I struggled a lot in grade school and had to work really hard to get through college and university.  I also had a hard time interviewing for jobs, mostly because people did discriminate against me based on my appearance and the fact that while I've improved my social proficiency, I still come off as 'weird' to a lot of people (which is why I almost always succeed on phone interviews, but crash and burn on the in-person ones).\n\nI guess my point is that I am not anything special, but I don't see myself as trash or worthless either.  I've been called ugly more times than I can count, to my face and behind my back.  Just this year, all three of my closest friends who have no reason to do me harm pretty much admitted to me that I am probably never going to get a relationship because of how I look and the way I am.  But as far as I am concerned, the fact that other people choose to see me as a weirdo, and ugly guy, or a monster has nothing to do with me, that's THEIR business.  I'l still be at home, at work, or out at a restaurant or the movies minding my own business while they waste time and brainpower thinking about how ugly I am.\n\nAnyway, I am interested to hear other people's perspectives on this matter.

I tried to ask about their day to the two girls in the elevator, they gave me strange looks and nodded awkwardly. My texts were ignored when I asked my classmate about their day and wished them well. No thank you or anything. And another girl I\u2019ve attempted to make friends with walked out on me the day after we had lunch together without saying why. These lead me to missing school for a month due to my self-esteem and former depression. \n\nAt my last resort, I\u2019ve even tried making friends in a Weeb club (Was a weeb before.) but instead, people are still cliquey and this one dude even tried talking to me so I don\u2019t feel left out.

A good amount actually I\u2019m often going out and hanging with them and there are several different groups so in the textbook sense of the word I\u2019m not really alone or lonely.\n\nMy problem is no matter how much I surround myself with people or how many times I go out and hang with them I never really feel less lonely. Idk maybe it\u2019s my own anxiety making things up but I never feel at home or really part of the groups I hang out with even if they invite me to all the hangs and we all have a good time laughing and hanging out in my heart of hearts I don\u2019t really feel part of them.\n\nThere are three people particularly close to me and two of them are really good people they\u2019re kind and I have no doubt they\u2019re real friends but they\u2019re in love with each other and seldom have time for me and when we do hang out together I feel like a third wheel to the two and even if I\u2019m hanging with them individually we\u2019re still almost always talking about the other person that isn\u2019t there. \n\nThey\u2019re both really good people and I appreciate them but I just don\u2019t feel good about myself around them.\n\nAnd the last one who is my best friend and has been in my life for the longest time has been really busy and will be continually busy for the foreseeable future. She often has little time for me and the two of us don\u2019t often get to spend quality time together so our interaction is mostly updating each other on our lives via text and checking up on each other here and there occasionally calling one another for help with a problem she\u2019s actually probably the only person that doesn\u2019t make me feel alone but she\u2019s not around a lot so most days I just feel lonely.\n\nI just wanna meet someone who\u2019ll have me as a priority and who I in turn will also prioritize. I know it\u2019s selfish but Idk that anything else will make this horrid lonely feeling go away.\n\nAny thoughts or advice is welcome but I mainly just wanted to vent this out anonymously.", "subreddit": "lonely"}

I got three wishes and the only thing I couldn\u2019t do was wish for more wishes. I only had one wish though. To fall in love. I know that sounds cheesy, but it would be nice to be able to share more than a friendship with someone outside of my family. I repel people because I have depression and anxiety but I\u2019m on an antidepressant now. I just wish one of the people that I liked would care to notice me and talk to me, and not run because of the way I dress. Or act. Someone told me this today: your face and clothes are so sad and depressed but you have really pretty eyes. I\u2019ve gotten this complement a lot since I was a kid. I\u2019m Native American and German so I can tan and I have dark hair. But you would expect someone who looks like me to have brown eyes. That\u2019s not the case. I have a gold ring around both of my pupils, then a green ring and then a blue ring on the outside. My eye color changes when I look at different colors and you can see many different colors when they\u2019re in sunlight. All that being said, no one, not even my mom or therapist can look me directly in the eyes while I\u2019m also looking at them for more than ten seconds. I think it scares a lot of people off. People usually have two reactions. 1. They turn away really fast and act like they weren\u2019t looking. 2. They stare at my eyes like a weirdo and try to catch glimpses of them. And for some reason people can tell when I\u2019m looking at them or in their general direction. And vice versa goes for me. Three guys that I have liked, at some point, I feel like I have caught them looking at me and I usually meet their eyes. This kind of makes me uncomfortable but really I\u2019m actually kind of glad to see that someone isn\u2019t afraid to see what my eyes hold. I know that seemed trivial but I have no one to talk to.

I've had one or two close friendships outside of them that have helped me grow as a person, but I never seemed to be able to apply my growth around these people. so, I realized I needed to leave to better myself.

I feel like I can go out there and meet nice folk and not feel like a worthless, hateful piece of garbage. \n\nTake it from me, if you stay where you are now, it probably won't ever change. if you decide to take this plunge like I did, but you need someone to talk to while you're going through your friendship withdrawals, chat me.

I didn't mourn for him then because I knew nothing about him. Now here I am, at 5 in the morning, crying in bed because I finally understand him. My family has even said that I remind them of him, all while thinking that I'm perfectly happy being alone when in reality I'm one life hurdle away from following his footsteps exactly.\n\nI'm sure he was an alright guy, and I really hope he wouldn't have minded me posting his story like this.

Last night i dreamed about a girl i liked a lot back in high school. It was the most wonderful dream ever, ive never felt that emotions in my life, its actually making me tear up as i 'speak' right now... It was a fun little dream, of course, all good things must come to an end. Il tell you later what i dreamed about, for now its about who she is: A girl i met from my friends group, new addition to the group, we instantly kicked off and talked and had fun joked laughed and she was always next to me hugged me (that was giving me life energy i need it desperately im almost completely out) and we messaged eachother a lot when we were away and well it all started kinda dying out just as i was trying to ask her out, her intentions were clear and i was about to make it happen i dont remember the last time i was this confident I KNEW it was meant to be... Boy oh boy do i wanna travel back in time and just shout to myself not to hurt myself, because im undesirable and it wont work Needless to say it didnt work i asked her out on a date she rejected saying she was seeing someone .... if i was a friend she wouldve told me \"Heyy there look at this cute guy ive met\" instead ... she just confirmed my grim calculations I was on the verge of greatness i was\u00a0this\u00a0close ... She stopped talking to me because she found someone better, obviously, because im worst its easy to find someone else ... I fell so hard i flopped i felt like everyone is against me and the world just doesnt want me to succeed. In the dream i was dreaming of usual hanging out with her, i hug her for a whole minute and we talk calmly about our days at the bus stop while i wait for the bus yes she went out of her way to keep me company at a bus station at freezing temperatures, she is wonderful And in the dream she said i should follow her and be quick so i dont miss the bus, \"alrightyyyy\" i Said and followed knowing it will be something interesting. It was, she ran behind a building, hid behind a gate a hopped out to scare me with a heart shaped chocolates box \"HAPPY VALENTINES\" she said \"wait what its Valentine's day????\" (in the dream apperently not irl) \"what? how did you not know?\" \"i guess because its just like any other day for me, but seeing people happy and loved\" \"Today that changes !!! will you be my valentine??\" I gasped in shock, my heart beat increased i started feeling emotions in the dream !!! \" YEEES\" I shouted while surprised she also added \"I liked you for quite some time, will you be my boyfriend?\" I just hugged her and she kissed me and we went on to hug for a few more seconds. Why? because my heart started to beat faster and my body and brain were experiencing emotions ive never felt in my life, i could feel my real body i started phasing out of the dream in that moment i realized the depressing sad truth- love is for me, just imagination Ive felt the love stricken feeling for 3 seconds after waking up and immediately after that an explosive detonated in my gut, sharp pain, sadness, loneliness, monsters... I wanted to stop crying but it just made it worse, i wanted to go back to her warm hug but it just made me feel worse and worse and worse\n\ni was borderline dead the whole day and still am, i want to fo to sleep\n\nand never wake up\n\nplease put me in a dream with her, one so wonderful my brain doesnt wake up from\n\nTL;DR\na friendly girl who was interested in me rejected me because she found someone else and now i feel like shit because i couldve got her love\n\nso i dream love that i will never get, hugs and attention", "subreddit": "lonely"}

Seriously, very few things in this world bring me similar happiness to finding a new secret place and exploring every little nook and cranny of it.\n\nI used to have friends to explore these places with, but they never want to hang out with me anymore. I used to have an ex girlfriend to do photography and travel with, but she doesn't want me any more, and now she has a new man that serves as a constant reminder of what a failure I am.\n\nNow I have nobody. Nobody wants to go explore with me. Nobody wants to go hike with me. Nobody wants to find these secret little beautiful places except myself.\n\nI've been trying to make it work. Every time I want to do something, regardless of whether I'm alone or not (100% of the time, I am) I'll do it. Sometimes I get really anxious that I am alone, because I have anxiety that gets worse when I'm not around anyone else. Sometimes, I really do have a nice time doing whatever I'm doing and spend some time alone exploring. Or talking to my camera, the only person I truly feel will never let me down (the irony being that my camera's glitched many times since I bought it, letting me down and ruining a great cineshoot.)\n\nFrom an outsider's perspective, you'd think I'm handling the loneliness extremely well. That I'm moving on from my ex greatly by always being out doing things and not staying in all day. \n\nIt just hurts to get to the destination and realize that you're alone. You don't have anyone to share the memories with. You don't have anyone who wants to see it with you, who truly cares about you. That if you died while exploring, nobody would find out. Nobody would care. I may have my camera, but I don't have people who will watch my content. I don't have any \"fans\" or anyone who genuinely enjoys the videos I put out. I might as well be talking to a brick wall.\n\nJust about every night, I go to bed and dream. I dream of travelling the world with the perfect girl. Someone who loves me and someone I love. Someone who'd rather go to Ikea than a fancy restaurant. Someone who would rather sleep in a van than an expensive house. Someone who'd rather go on a morning hike than sleep in. Someone who would rather just drive for hours than watch Netflix. \n\nI know she's out there, I just doubt she would ever want to be with someone like me. Someone so fucking annoying, stupid, depressed, and awkward like me. I just doubt anyone would want to explore with me. I don't care if it's a girlfriend or just a friend at this point, I just want someone to explore and see the world with.\n\nI hope this makes sense. It feels a bit better. Last time I tried to do this, I fucked up the wording and it made me feel worse, but it really helps to write it all down, even if nobody will read it.\n\nLove, anon.", "subreddit": "lonely"}

It was the happiest I had felt in years.\n\nI\u2019m afraid that I\u2019m gonna sound like a huge creep saying all of this, but I have to share it with someone. \n\nSo here goes: I\u2019ve been real nostalgic over my hometown back in California recently, and as a result I ended up thinking of her as well. As a result, my memory of her worked her way into my subconscious and I fell asleep. \n\nIt was a surprisingly peaceful dream, especially compared to the crappy ones I\u2019ve been having recently. I don\u2019t remember the events leading up to seeing her very much, but I do remember what happened when I ran into her... somewhat. \n\nShe was as beautiful as I remembered her. She seemed happy to see me, and we hugged each other. She ended up offering me her shoulder to rest my head on. Just being that close to her, and the warm physical contact involved just felt so real and cozy. I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever felt that peaceful and content in a long time. \n\nIt was such an amazing dream. The kind I rarely have. I haven\u2019t really been doing well since I moved to tell you the truth, and a day hardly ever goes by that I don\u2019t miss that place. \n\nAs a result, my mind has been in a messed up place. So having dreams like that about happier times in my hometown and the people in it, are surprising, but very much welcome.\n\nIn that dream, I felt like things were normal again. Better than normal. I even tried going back to sleep as soon as I woke up, but sadly the previous dream didn\u2019t continue. Just another one of my regular dreams.\n\nI miss it all. I really do. I miss her, I miss my home, the friends I have over there, everything. I just want things to go back to normal, to tell you the whole truth.\n\nDo I sound like an obsessive creep? A bit of a loser? Kind of pathetic? Somewhere in that ballpark, or no? I feel like I do and I really don\u2019t like that.\n\nI know it\u2019s not healthy to rely on one person for internal happiness or whatever the term is, it\u2019s just that this person in particular was one of the few people I met in school that was genuinely nice to me, almost to the point that it threw me off because I wasn\u2019t really used to that. She was also very pretty and charming. I feel like what I\u2019m saying doesn\u2019t really do her justice, though. But thinking about her just brings back a lot of happy (and admittedly some not so happy) memories, and right now, I can\u2019t help but cling on to the past, especially when the present feels like being in a pitch black room with no exit, or running down a dark hallway that never seems to end.\n\nHonestly I really do feel like a creep for saying all of this, and I hate that I do. What do you think? Should I forget about her, or just find something or someone else for my mind to be preoccupied with? (Not in an obsessive way of course, at least I hope not) Or what should I do about this? Because I honestly don\u2019t know how to get past this. A big part of me wants to see her again, but there\u2019s another part that thinks maybe that isn\u2019t a good idea right now, or even soon. I don\u2019t know what to do.", "subreddit": "lonely"}

It seems to me like a lot of people here have resigned themselves to a life of loneliness simply because of their biological features and that no amount of self-improvement tips will actually create a positive difference.\n\nIn response to this, all I have to say is that I understand how all of you feel and that this is actually a very understandable response to someone giving you advice.\n\nWhen you've been suffering for a very long time and someone tries to give you advice as to how to improve yourself, it's extremely easy to just ignore it and move on, because chances are that one piece of advice will indeed have a minimal impact on your life. The reason for this is because there are so many variables that go into any interaction, and simply altering one of these variables won't result in much of a change. When someone says that you should improve your charisma, that may be well-intentioned, but what defines a charismatic person is comprised of so many variables that it's hard to articulate the steps one should take to become more charismatic.\n\nAdditionally, when advice is not guaranteed to work, it's harder to take seriously. If you attempt a strategy at reducing your social anxiety and it doesn't work, you're bound to be more inclined to never take that type of advice again. I made a post not too long ago about the role of fitness in my life and how it helped me to reduce some of my social anxiety, because the improvements to my physique helped increase my self-confidence. That being said, my social anxiety sure as hell isn't completely gone, which is why I understand why it's easy to brush off any advice as \"what works for you may not necessarily work for me\".\n\nHowever, there's a reason why I've titled this post as such, and noting this trend of resentment to all advice (some of which I regard as legitimately good advice that could very well lead to positive results) worries me. If you are completely resistant to advice, what are you going to do with your life? Just accept your current position that you already view negatively without making any attempt to feel better? Is that really how you want to live, or do you genuinely want things to get better for you?\n\nI guess my main question is this: \"What can I actually tell you to make you feel better?\"\n\nIf I say something like \"It gets better. I'm certain you are better than you view yourself, and I'm certain that others view you better than you perceive them to,\" I would get responses saying that you have no self-worth and are 100% convinced that everyone hates you. If I say something like \"Physical fitness was the biggest contributor to my eventual escape of FA\", I would get responses saying that I would never understand what it's like to be FA and that I only ever had the opportunity to exercise because I'm some \"normie\".\n\nIf I didn't take advice to some degree, I would still be FA and in the abyss that I found myself in a little over 2 years ago. I can't envision telling myself  \"This is exactly where I want to be\" when I was in that abyss, which is why I made it my mission to improve myself. Even if it's useless, I still welcome the presence of advice and compliments. I once got compared to Larry Fitzgerald while playing Ultimate Frisbee recently, and a compliment like that feels so much better than accepting your position in a pit of despair.\n\nIn closing, I will again ask what I can possibly say to help out this community. I'm not here to be condescending or invasive or anything along those lines. I'm only here to showcase positivity and hope. I'm here to offer support, but it seems more and more like support and advice are frowned upon in this subreddit. What can anyone say to make you all feel like you can escape the abyss?", "subreddit": "ForeverAlone"}

And I\u2019m not necessarily a hermit. I have friends with whom I hang out with fairly often. When I don\u2019t hang out with them I\u2019m usually hanging out with my family. I started my first job since college so right now I don\u2019t have any real tight work relationships but in the past for the most part I\u2019ve been able to establish that. A year ago in college I was in a fraternity and a lot of clubs. I had a gf who broke up with me six months ago. I actively looked to form relationships is what I\u2019m trying to say I guess.\n\nHowever through all this I just have this gaping hole it feels like in me a feeling loneliness. Even if I\u2019m not stereotypically depressed and feel rather happy or good some days this feeling persists. While I remember being depressed most of my life and in conjunction this loneliness it was never this gnawing. When I left the Marines to go to college It really started to feel stronger. \n\nAnd the feeling isn\u2019t like depression it\u2019s not stay in my bed all day. This loneliness is strong but dull it\u2019s just a steady persistent nag that I can\u2019t completely push outta of my mind. Even when I\u2019m around people it\u2019s there. It amplifies episodes of depression and just I don\u2019t know makes life just a little bit less I guess. The worst thing is I can never really seem to tell my therapist why I feel this way. I know I shouldn\u2019t I have a good family I have friends. I may not be the most extroverted but I\u2019m social. I\u2019ve had relationships in the past and I\u2019m currently opening back up to dating again. I shouldn\u2019t feel empty and lonely but I do. I\u2019ve been in combat sure but I don\u2019t have ptsd so there shouldn\u2019t be anything wrong but it\u2019s there.\n\nSo I\u2019m left here unsure of why and where this came from. The only thing I know is that it feels like someone is slowly pushing a knife in my heart. I don\u2019t know I just ultimately want to truly feel happy when I\u2019m with my friends and family.

I am sick of the constant, piercing dissonance between my internal monologue and the physical world. I do not know what is to blame for this feeling. What you may see looking at me is a pale, long haired, goofy short guy. I do not take most things seriously. I developed this as a strategy to appear happy to the outside world. I crack a lot of stupid surreal jokes that usually only result in odd looks from people. I dress in a way that sort of makes me look like I try only a little. I do well in school without putting in strong effort. I am an extra. Hallway filler to make the school look less empty. I do not have many friends; I wonder if I actually have friends at all most of the time. During fifty percent of my lunches I just sit in a remote, empty hallway and listen to sad /mu core music. I do not think I am a quiet kid-I talk a good bit. But not really to anyone, just at any sentient thing that will listen. Most people think I am on drugs. While I occasionally drink and dabble in smoking some grass, I rarely am inebriated at school. I just act really goofy. Sometimes my eyes are red, but that is because I was crying. I usually play that off like I am high, because I feel ashamed for any one to see me at my lows. I am often crying for a variety of reasons. School causes me to have to a stress breakdown. I have no true friends. I feel void of any human contact. The only thing I have is the constant berating and insulting from the inside of my head. I just want a close friend. Someone to hold and cuddle. I tried sex with someone: It did not go well to say the least. The person I am inside is much different than the outside. I could not expose myself to anyone as on top of my stupidity, I am self-conscious. I do not think I am capable of being intimate. People may see an extrovert, however I am deeply lonely.

I grew up homeschooled with some christian tutoring sessions around other christian kids but i developed like 0 social skills. My parents began fighting a lot mostly about money, 5th grade i was switched to public school at a small clique school didnt go great i got bullied a lot and became even more antisocial.My parents then got seperated and soon after me my mom and my sister moved out to the city.\nFor middle school i thought i was making some friends even though i still got teased a lot i had some people around me to sit with at lunch etc... then my sister started going to the highschool of my city which is a different system than my middle school. By this time my parents had officially divorced however things didnt turn out that simple. I decided to also go to thay highschool however things dont always work out great.\nMy older sister and i had been close when we were young but barely talked at this point, she also has social issues and apparently from her own mouth she trash talked me to her upperclassman buddies to look cool and funny.\nStill with 0 social skills once i left my middle school all the kids id been around except for 2 had ghosted me. At this point i didnt really get things so life decided to get worse. My parents divorce kept going on my dad turns out to be an alcoholic and lied about a lot of money stuff even though he makes a good amount of it. My dad decided to hate my mother for whatever reason and kept sueing her and still is sueing her to this day.\nThe stress and anxiety from all this continues to worsen. Im now a junior in highschool, still no friends one kid from my old school whod id been hanging out with a lot ghosted me, the other we just kinda stopped talking. My sister is really fucked up and started fighting with my mom a ton. A month ago my mom took away my sisters phone and my sister freaked out and assualted my mom, i didnt know what to do so i called the cops... they came and seperated however for some dumb reason they sided with my sister and arrested my mom. My mom got off charges recently but still my dads gonna make a huge deal about this in court. He keeps sueing us about money stuff like why he shouldnt pay child support or basic health insurance or anything for college even though he makes good money. AND IT GETS WORSE, my dad started dating this rich twofaced scumbag who owns a fucking lawfirm, now there engaged and he has even more money and now a lawyer giving him help for free which is totally fuking illegal but no ones stopping him. Anyways still no friends having trouble affording basic stuff even though income wise technically i should be a rich prep boi, mom has ptsd and anxiety but shes already paying for help with that so getting me a therapist or meds isnt realistic\n\nSo that was a stupid long rant about how my life sucks honestly i dont expect much to happen i just want my dad to be a good person and stop making my life hell, i wanna find some friends and do soemthing with my life. Im such a loser frankly none of this would be a problem if i just faded away\n\nEdit: i could on awhile longer but to make it clear i visited my dad for a while he would say how much he loved me and then turn around and force my mom to spend thousands of dollars on legal shit which obvs affects me. I stopped talking to him half a year ago honestly he always texts me he loves me and sht i feel like im being mocked for never actually been loved or cared for by anyone.", "subreddit": "lonely"}

Over an eight hour date since they didn't leave until 4am. I genuinely thought that this date would have gone somewhere else if they were on the same page because five hours later, I wake up to find myself blocked by them. It's hard to accept that they just wanted sex since they spent that much time with me, but I guess in the end they got what they wanted. I definitely felt this one. I felt destroyed that someone would be so callous in their treatment of another person. It shocked me.  \n\nthe second one, we just talked. ended up swapping socials and started talking more. they ask me on a date for ice cream after about a week of talking and I say yes. The day before, I wake up to text them about the next day, to find myself blocked. nothing suggested that I said or did something wrong. I still feel like I did something and I just can't figure out what. It sucks because out of these three, this one was the one I hoped would have been different than the other two, looking back on it.\n\nthe third one, we connected right away. I ended up sleeping over at their place, and then came back over that night to hang out some more. The next three days were the same. Thanksgiving day, we both had plans with our families. We hung out together in the morning but didn't plan on hanging out at night. That night, I got into an argument with my parents and left their place early. I texted this person to see if they wanted to go Black Friday shopping. I picked them up and we went to the mall, where I proceeded to have an anxiety attack from all the people there. Fast forward to us in my car in the parking lot of this person's apartment complex, where I'm having a panic attack. The night ends abruptly as they need to go to sleep. Over the next 5 days, they start texting less and less, as I start texting more and more. They eventually send me a message saying essentially, \"You're too needy. I would have been inclined to date you but that night at the mall was weird and I didn't like that.\" They blocked me as well. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nYes, I did meet all these people on a dating app. Yes, I did hookup with #1 and #3. No, I wasn't looking for just a hookup since it says so in my bio.

I hadn't dated or gone out with someone for two and a half years until I went out with #1. I maybe am going about this in the wrong way, but I really just want to ease the ache in my heart. \n\nNot sure what I should do from here.

She was new to the area and was in need of a friend and I was there to quickly fill that void. For sub-context, I did not have any friends and desperately sought out social interaction in any way. We quickly became friends and hung out with each other regularly. At the time, she had a boyfriend but was in an \u201copen relationship\u201d.

I struggle with talking, I get nervous, I can't follow instructions clearly, it's like my IQ drops by 20 or 30 points in social situations or when in front of others. There are times where I just want to start crying regarding my pathetic self.

I'm clumsy, nervous.\n\nI never had a girlfriend, I never kissed a girl, and of course am a virgin. I just can't be \"sexy\" or \"attractive\" at all. I'm not depressed because someone dear to me died, I'm depressed because my life sucks and I can't seem to do anything about it.\n\nI'm probably autistic, however it wasn't diagnosed when I was younger. I share some symptoms but not others (I'm overly sensitive to certain noises, I am repetitive, I'm not social, I'm obsessed with certain topics). There's something different about me, a different aura. People constantly want me to \"be more sensitive\", \"stop rationalizing\", \"just go on with the flow\" but I can't. When I'm in front of anyone I just can't enter any state of flow. I just want to get away (back to my home, with my videogames, movies, books, when I feel safe, in control, not judged), I rationalize everything and start hating the person I'm with because I'm also a misanthrope due to years and years of bullying and rejection (not counting the despicable things humans do related to war, hunger, competition, poor people, etc.) Everyone seems to be shallow, not compassionate at all or judging me at all times. I know they think I'm a recluse, a loner. I can't deal with it, I can't handle criticism because my ego is so destroyed it's not even useful anymore. I just shut myself into my own mind and hobbies. Pure hedonism. Addicted to porn, videogames, Reddit, YouTube, reading posts and some novels.\n\nI'm fatigued all the time, my sleeping schedule is fucked up and I have no motivation at all to get out of bed so I stay there binging Reddit and YouTube for hours. I hate myself so much you wouldn't believe. People \"like\" me but never love me. Friends want to be like me but never have the same lives as I have. People don't understand what it's like to be alone romantically speaking all your life, never having felt loved by another person. People don't understand depression, social anxiety. They can be depressed, but they still do things, still are motivated, still have goals. I don't have any of that, I just want to sleep forever. If it weren't for my family I'd kill myself right now. Of course you can't tell anybody that, but that's how I've been feeling this past year.\n\nThinking about the future is impossibly hard. I get anxious about anything, and the world doesn't motivate me one bit. I've lost all hope, I've lost any will to be more socially active, or to have a healthier lifestyle, etc.\n\nI have no social capital in front of everyone, I can't show any value.

At any moment the conversation could dry up and things get awkward while we search for things to say, like every conversation is just obligatory and we're both trying to get along but we can't seem to get on the same wavelength.  I remember years ago back in high school I could hang out with my friends and always feel comfortable in their presence.  I never had to think about what to say or worry about keeping the conversation going.  I didn't feel so self-conscious but now it feels like I can't prevent this discomfort from happening with every conversation I have with other people.\n\nEven on the rare occasion when I hang out with those old friends or I'm talking to internet friends that tension behind everything is still there.  I try not to think about and try to be natural but nothing seems to make it go away, like I'm just not as good at being with people as I was back then.  I want to fall in love with a girl and be in a relationship but I often wonder if that's even possible, or if this ever-present awkwardness would eventually infiltrate even that kind of relationship.  I just want to feel what its like to be comfortable around other people again.", "subreddit": "ForeverAlone"}

Those are the guys who don\u2019t have a problem with settling down and are looking for long-term relationships.

She was an Asian too, and was open to my friendship but not a relationship. We reached to a position where we were both comfortable in sharing numbers (She was the one who offered the number but I was hesitant). I was okay with that but the issue was, the more I learned about her, and talked to here everyday, more I got infatuated with her.\n\nAfter a month of talking for several hours everyday and being told by her that I am the *'most perfect guy that there can ever be'* on multiple occasions, I was baffled why she is reluctant for a relationship if I was really so darn good ? So a week ago I told her she needs to give me a reason for rejecting me if she don't find any fault in me. And after a lot of reluctance from her side and me standing my ground. She finally admitted.\n\n\"It's because I am Indian.\"\n\nI couldn't believe the girl I thought was an open minded and progressive person, will be so blatantly racist. My heart was broken and I felt like I was back stabbed.\n\nThis is when I started to look for somebody for myself on r/foreveralonedating. And 2 posts later I am noticing a very recognizable pattern.

I\u2019ll manage.\u201d\n\nI can\u2019t help but notice there are way too many people who tip-toe around each other as if they are a burden to the world. As if to say \u201cI\u2019m truly sorry that I exist. I will do my best to make myself as small as possible so that you are not inconvenienced by my mere presence.\u201d I see this everywhere I go, whether it\u2019s the customers I encounter at work, my friends, my partner or even *myself*. I remember the way I use to walk around the apartments/houses I\u2019d share with others and literally tip-toe so as not to make too much noise. Or I would avoid using the shared spaces for fear that someone else needed it or that I would be noticed/judged for whatever I did.\n\nI\u2019ve done some thinking to try and unpack why people go on living like this, and I think there are a few dynamics at play here:\n\n* People in general lack self-respect, self-love and self-esteem. They see themselves as inferior and in constant competition to the people around them. They are living in total separation.. which is the polar opposite to the enlightened notion of non-dual oneness (our true nature).\n* On some level, people actually believe they don\u2019t have equal right to be here on this planet and as a part of society. They don\u2019t necessarily see their being born as a conscious choice. They don\u2019t value their life as sacred, and more or less see it as meaningless in comparison to others who are perhaps more worthy, important or deserving.\n* People easily confuse this behavior with being \u201cnice\u201d. They believe they are actually acting in the highest ideal when they pander to others (at the expense of themselves). It\u2019s a sort of over-compensation to the selfishness we see most people lost in (which is equally messed up). And so, they reinforce their behavior with this justification because they want so badly not to be seen as the asshole.\n\nAll of these reasons are quite obviously distortions from the fact of the matter, which is the following: you not only have just as much right to exist as anybody else, this entire reality and thing we call life ***is you****.* You are not separate from it in any way, shape or form. Any sense of separation is a mere construct of your programmed mind, your ego. The truth of the matter is that we\u2019re all walking around co-existing and co-creating all of this reality, believing we\u2019re individuals when in fact we are all fragmentations of the same energy (the source of all of creation).\n\nTo be fair, most everybody operates from this place of individuality to varying degrees (unless of course you are Jesus or the Buddha). But you will also notice that not everyone is walking around so apologetically either. There are those who are completely grounded in their bodies, know who they are and are not afraid to impose themselves on the world around them.. both to help others, and to get what is needed when necessary. When we come across people like this, we don\u2019t think \u201cwhat an asshole!\u201d.. we actually admire their polite shamelessness.\n\nI believe it is so important to aspire to this more ideal, balanced way of being if you desire to grow to experience new possibilities and start re-engaging with the world in a profound way. You are allowed to ask for help. You are allowed to mess up from time to time and god forbid \u201cinconvenience\u201d another. You are allowed to emit all the noises that go along with being a human. You are allowed to exist! Just as much as every living/non-living, seen/unseen thing in this world. You are it.. all of it. And so is absolutely everything else around you.\n\nSo please, stop apologizing! Instead of saying \u201cexcuse me, I\u2019m sorry\u201d.. maybe try, \u201cexcuse me.. **thank you**!\u201d And you don\u2019t have to be a dick about it either, that\u2019s the other extreme. Just do so as if you are constantly aware of the sacredness of all of reality that not only includes you, but *is you*. It\u2019s all you! Keep your shoulders back, look people straight in the eye and delight in the wisdom that we are all in this world in perfect harmony with on another, not in competition.\n\n\\- DivineSoda", "subreddit": "ForeverAlone"}

I'm working on getting my bachelors of science in electrical engineering. I have hobbies. I play piano, and volunteer at a local shelter in my spare time. I consider myself a pretty friendly individual. I used to be really shy, but I think I've come out of my shell for the most part. Social anxiety is still a very real thing for me, but it's something I've learned to work past out of necessity. And yet, I haven't been able to develop any true friendships? I'm sitting by myself on a Friday evening wondering what to do with myself, because I don't have anywhere to go or anyone to hang out with. I'm restless and bored, and all I want is to not be alone. I don't know what I'm doing wrong, you know? It feels like I'm doing all the right things that would theoretically lead to friendships, but it's not going anywhere in practice. Most of the time I can keep myself busy enough so that I don't think about it, but it's times like these when there's nothing left to do that I feel this despair crawling up on me.

Now that's all fun and games, but it reminded me about something I hear a lot, and that's that you just to get one yes.\n\nThat is, you might get rejected 1,000 times, but it's worth it if you meet the perfect partner for you on the 1,001st try. But that completely misses the reality of most people's dating lives. Most people have partial success. That is, they go out on a few dates, fuck, and then eventually decide they're not meant for each other. And that's ok. They had some good times. It wasn't meant to be. They learn from the experience.\n\nAnd yet, when they're giving us advice, that's totally missing. They think we're just holding out for the right person, and once we meet, it'll be magical and we'll get married and live happily ever after.\n\nAnd yet that's not what ever happens. I was reading a story about a woman who lost her virginity at 37 today. (It was in the Guardian if you want to read it.) She wasn't holding out. She met some dude and they had sex even though it was clear they weren't compatible. \n\nThe bottom line is, one success is not enough, and if you've never had any success, the idea that one success might be enough is nice, but it's just not true. If you want to go from here to \"normal,\" you have to cross into the territory where you're succeeding relatively often. Because finding one person who will go out on a date with you--or even one person who will have sex with you--isn't enough to meet your real hopes and dreams. You have to actually learn how to make it happen. Not just how to get lucky.\n\nPersonally, I'm just not cut out for that.", "subreddit": "ForeverAlone"}

I don't know what to do or where to go. In my head I've thought for a long time that if i found a girlfriend or someone with who i shared a bond it would get better, but even that seems impossible to me atm. I feel like either I'm not good enough or undeserving of it, and my past experiences don't help either.

(Long post)", "author": "riishax", "self_text": "**TL;DR: After being cancelled on by the same girl twice in half a year, I've finally realized that I no longer have any way of getting the kind of maningful connection necessary for a relationship.**\n\n**You can skip the Prelude and still get the full picture of the situation. You can probably also skip the Background and still get a general picture of the situation.**\n\n# Prelude\n\nIt has been a long time since i last posted on here. I first came to this sub a little over a year ago when I was new at university and I was feeling just how inadequate and lonely I was in that environment. My first post was a confused mess  that reflected my state of mind as I was surrounded by people without connecting with anyone. Since then I've dropped out and switched from academics to a more practical type of education. I'm glad to say that my life has improved alot since then, I now have collegues I get along with and a line of work I'm actually convinced I want to persue.\n\nHowever recent events have shattered any illusion that this improvement has any chance of being reflected in the \"romantic dimension\". And to think that just untill recently I imagined my way out of FA. I had hoped that around this time of year I'd post a \"farewell-post\" on here instead of this, but here I am. \n\nThe line of events goes back to this spring, before I switched paths, when I was on a sort of trip with my two best friends. Few times had I had so much fun as during this event, and it sent me on a mood of excptionally rare optimism (even though my day-to-day life still consisted of the depressing university life) that combined with something one of those friends had said prior to me, when the death of a relative of his made him realize not to postpone stuff with those that matter to you. It was during the trip, when I fully realized how blessed I was to have friends like them, that I fully realized the meaning of those words. So then I made the decision to message my old crush from highschool that I had not heard from in a year and a half and had not seen in two. \n\n# Background\n\nAs we were on friendly terms when we split ways, this led to us agreeing on meeting up in the summer when she returned home (she studies abroad). This ended up not happening due to bad planing and little time on her part. Normally I would not have belived this explaination and assumed she was just being kind, not wanting meet but not to reject me outright either. However, she proposed to meet up for Christmas instead, when she would return next time. I would have just accepted her excuse and given up otherwise, but now that she was the one to take the initiative for once, I was hopeful. \n\nAs to what my intentions were, It was always an unclear mixture, never fully clear to me. It had been a long time since I got over my \"Oneitis\" phase, so I was not sure what I would have felt if i saw her. Was she still a crush, or just an old friend? Either way there was no doubt in my mind that she was a great girl and one of the few people I felt legitimate liking for. \n\nFor my part I had grown alot as a person in the time since our graduation, so I also hoped to show her the new me. If upon meeting her I would have decided to ask her out, now I would have the confidence I never had when we were classmates. Even if it ended in failure I was not going to despare, I'd just see it at my first real try with a girl and move on. For you see, my worst sin is cowardice. At 21 years old I have still not asked a girl out once. But I had made the decision that this would change regardless of how it went with this one girl, which takes us to current times.\n\n# Recent events\n\nLo and behold, once again my old crush cancelled out on me. When I sent a message a few days ago to have a concrete plan for when to meet and what to do, she was initially positive. But then she came with a startlingly familiar excuse; low on time, prioritizing family and closest friends, and so on, and so on, and so on. \n\nThis is when I snapped. I did something else I had not dared before, I called her on her bullshit. I told her exactly what I had suspected those previous times; that she was just being nice and that she did not really want to meet me, but didn't want to reject me oughtright. I made it clear in this message  that I understood, and the only part that I was disappointed with was the lying part, that she couldnt just be real with me but continued giving me false hope.\n\nShe denied once again, and insisted that it was due to a sotrage of time. I apologised, not sure if she was doubling down on the lie or not. Either way it does not matter, because even if she is being real with me, it means that I'm so far down her priority list that she cant spare a couple of hours over a three week period.\n\n# Conclusions\n\nWell atleast I got a conclusion you might think, now I am free to try anew, even if this girl wouldnt give me a chance. So I tought when I first understood that she would cancel out on me again. But then it hit me what was the other main reason why I have never asked a girl out other than cowardice: indifference. \n\nWhy do I seek romance in the first place? I am exeptionally priviledged compared to many on this sub. I am lucky enough to have loving parents, the best friends you could have, and good collegues aswell. But however important these three pillars are for making it in my familiar, social and professional life respecively, it is not anything you can build something of an own life and family. I need that fourth pillar, someone plan and build a life with. \n\nBut there is no one interested, no one that cares. Even if I am not a victim of lookism, the maximal interst any girl has shown is the occasional glare too much when I am in public. So even if it does not seem to be entirely impossible to attract girls, those few times its just the passing impression I make, with no way of building on it.\n\nUnfortunately it seems like all chances of real interraction with the opposite sex ended in highschool for me. That's why I was still on about an old crush from those days; it was the last time I felt like there was a reason or way for me to persue that kind of relationship because i got to know the person and had a chance at getting myself known.\n\nBut the grim reality is that I matured late in many aspects. When I still had the opportunity I had not yet developed the qualites to exploit it: maturity, confidence, and so on. So now I'm at a dead end, with no way of changing my situation.\n\n\"But what about dating sites?\"; I hear the normie reading this ask. Well that was never an option. Call me a naive romantic, but I'm not interested in comodified dating created by out exeptionally lonely times. I want something real, something happening out there in real life that will lead to mutual understanding with someone.  But now it is evident that i Will never have that.

{"post_id": "eanun7", "created_utc": 1576350650, "title": "You are not your flaws.", "author": "Fixed_Assets", "self_text": "One time, I decided to go driving to work in the rain.  And rain it did, it was coming down in buckets.  Normally, I don't mind the rain.  But I did this day because as I was leaving the freeway, I nearly spun out making a left turn coming out of the off-ramp.  That type of interaction puts me on edge.\n\nWhen I got to the office and told my co-workers about it, they recommended I get my tires checked out.  And when I did, sure enough, the tire guy told me my tires were fucked and that I needed new ones unless I was planning on doing more unintentional drift racing.  So I shelled out the $300 some dollars for tires and labor and went and did some donuts in a dusty parking lot to see if the traction had gotten better (and it did).\n\nWhy tell this story about my tire troubles in a board about being FA?  Because I feel like a lot of people blame themselves for their defects instead of disassociating themselves with them.  When the tire guy told me that my tires were shit, I didn't get mad at him for disrespecting my tires or my car, I acknowledged that this was a legit problem that he was pointing out to me so I could get it fixed to avoid future shitty traffic situations.  It helps seeing the car as something separate from me that I could fix with the help of an expert.\n\nNow I know this a poor analogy for being FA because our issues aren't as easily solved as worn tires.  I'm FA due to genetic conditions that can never be cured and are absolute deal breakers to women (and even just regular people who could potentially be friends).  But the way I see it, I don't see a reason to take those problems personally any more than a defect I can fix - I just need to be aware if it so I can work around it.  If, for some reason, it was impossible to fix the tires because manufacturers stopped making them, I'd just avoid driving during bad weather.  It would suck, but it's still better than blaming myself.\n\nI'm not really sure why I am writing this.  I guess it is because I found it tragic that so many people on an earlier post were arguing so far for why they deserve to hate themselves and, with one exception, were not very convicing - it sounds more like they just felt comfortable doing so and were making excuses for why it is a good idea rather than providing a convincing argument about why they deserve to be hated more than a society that ostracized them for things not their fault.\n\nI'm not trying to sound like one of those 'think positive' assholes, because I hate shit like that.  Denying we are deeply flawed individuals or trying to minimize those flaws is as stupid as pointing out that there was nothing wrong with my tires and I should keep driving on them while 'thinking positive' and that this would be enough.  It isn't and that mindset is a stupid one.  I guess what I am trying to say is that even if you are short, stupid, ugly, autistic, socially anxious, depressed, or just plain weird, it's not your fault and it doesn't make you a bad person.

I want to point my fingers at them and say, \u201cyou\u2019re the reason why my life is so hard!\u201d \n\nBut in actuality, the reason why my life is hard is because of the way I am. I am a hard of hearing individual who knows zero sign language and only communicates verbally. I have the hardest time making friends and being close to people. Because of my disability, I am even afraid to make new friends because I am worried they will want to stop being my friend. I have met some people who enjoyed talking to me, but they noticed that I reply to some things a bit weird, or off topic. For me, friends and romantic relationships come and go. I am envious of people who have friends they met 12 years ago, and they still converse and enjoy each other\u2019s company today. I used to have those kinds of friends when I was younger, but now that I\u2019m in my twenties it feels I seldom have friends. I have co-workers who talk to me, I have my parent\u2019s friends who talk to me, my family talks to me, but none of them are \\*my\\* friends. \n\nI do go to gatherings where I meet new people and enjoy talking to them. But whenever the environment gets loud, for instance people start talking louder in the background, I tend to lose all the information people are telling me. I just end up chuckling and hope they keep talking. But this is no way to make connections because now I don\u2019t know half of what this person said. I know most people are nice and friendly, and I\u2019m trying to be nice and friendly as well. But it is hard when you miss out on what made the group laugh, or when you ask them a question they already answered before. \n\nIt\u2019s starting to feel like I\u2019m having memory issues as well. I can\u2019t seem to recall a lot of things, like what I have in my fridge, or what this person wanted yesterday. I feel that I am too young to be having so many forgetful moments. I already know that this is a common sign for deaf people. They get depression easily, and with depression comes forgetfulness. Sometimes I even forget something someone said to me earlier in a conversation. For example, at a gathering I was at we were celebrating someone\u2019s birthday. But before this birthday-person came to the gathering we decided to sing happy birthday. I complained that I am the worst singer in the world, and the person next to me said that he is as well so he usually just claps instead of sings. When the birthday boy came to the gathering we all started to sing and the guy next to me clapped. I completely forgot about our conversation about him clapping, and if I remembered I know I would have laughed with him and possibly made a friend. But I completely forgot about this and only remembered two hours later after we all have left. \n\nI\u2019ve developed social anxiety as well, which I didn\u2019t use to have \\*at all\\* when I was younger. It developed in college after a friend of mine made an advance toward me that I didn\u2019t want. He was looking for a girlfriend, but I did not want him romantically. Since then I have avoided people completely in college, especially boys. I\u2019m working hard on getting over that, but it\u2019s still in me. \n\nThe reason why I wanted to blame my parents is because I sometimes believe that if I was in an environment where I could sign to everyone, I would be happier. But they made the choice to strip sign language from my life growing up so I could verbally talk. Most people are surprised when I tell them I\u2019m deaf, and they do treat me or see me differently when they learn about this. Maybe this is a good thing, but it does not feel so great because now I don\u2019t have any close friends. I know that there are ways to learn sign language online and go to deaf-events. But for some unknowable reason, I have no motivation to learn sign language online, and deaf tutors are impossible to find where I live. \n\nI miss the days where I could lay back on my bed and just talk to my friends for hours. I miss laughing uncontrollably and genuinely enjoying life with them. I miss spending time with good friends and talking about everything together and doing everything together. I want that life again, but my problem is- I want it too much. I want another close connection with someone who I know we are completely happy together even if we\u2019re doing nothing. I miss going to places with them and just chilling. I haven\u2019t had close friends in almost 6-7 years, and this feeling of loneliness is incredibly overpowering. When I see people who appear to be close friends I immediately get envious or jealous. I always ask myself \u201cwhat\u2019s wrong with me? Why can\u2019t I have friends?\u201d Maybe I\u2019m just unlucky, maybe this feeling of loneliness will help me appreciate my friends in the future more. Maybe I\u2019m too desperate and come off too strong. Whatever it is, I just feel I\u2019ve been alone for too long. \n\nI know that whenever people are in distress, they want to blame others. Like me, I want to blame my mom for this. But I know parents didn\u2019t make me this way, I did. I know they always want what\u2019s best for their child. But, my god, I can\u2019t seem to find happiness with people anymore. It\u2019s killing me", "subreddit": "lonely"}

Is being in a loving relationship is *really* as good as it seems from the outside?", "author": "absolutelynovalue", "self_text": "Hear me out.\n\nI feel as annoyed as the next FA-er when someone who hasn't been out of a relationship since they were 15 obliviously talks about how great it must be to be single. If there's one thing I'm pretty sure of, it's that being on your own *is* worse than being with someone (except of course if that someone is an abusive piece of shit, but that goes without saying).\n\nWhat I wonder however is whether being in a loving relationship, though of course preferable to what we on this sub experience day to day, is *really* as good as we make it out to be. I ask this question because literally everything I've ever been excited for or fantasised about has ultimately disappointed me the second it became a reality.\n\nHere are some examples, off the top of my head:\n\n* When I was 13, I learned I was getting a Nintendo Wii for Christmas. In the weeks leading up to the day, I was so fucking pumped. I kept imagining myself playing all these cool games, thinking about how amazing it would be to marry together Zelda quests with the motion sensing controller. In reality, though, it wasn't really anything to write home about. The games weren't that great, the novelty of the controller soon wore off, and within about six months I was only using it from time to time so my parents didn't think me ungrateful.\n* This weekend, I promised myself an expensive, unhealthy meal as a reward for getting through another week of nine-to-five drudgery. I was really looking forward to it, and when the time came I ordered a fuck off big burger, a shit ton of fries, and a frankly obscene milkshake concoction that will probably give me diabetes. And guess what? It was okay. Nothing special, really.\n* This one is probably TMI, but sometimes I'll go a week or so without masturbating, since it invariably feels better when you, for lack of a better term, recharge your laser beam before letting it off again. Well, even when I do that the orgasm never quite lives up to the billing. I always end up climaxing with a sense of, \"Meh. That was fine, I suppose\".\n\nThese are of course trivial things by comparison to being in a loving relationship, but I think they are nonetheless instructive when it comes to human nature (or at least my own nature). The fantasy of the thing always sets a level of expectation that it's impossible for the actual thing to meet. So much of life is living in hope of better things to come - be it meeting \"the one\" or, in my case, drinking a horrific milkshake - and the moment itself is fleeting. So fleeting that it often goes by unenjoyed. (Yeah, I'm pretty blatantly ripping off Schopenhauer at this point).\n\nOf course, I will probably never be able to test this hypothesis, since I'll likely never get to experience being in a relationship.

I don't think I can do this.\n\nSo, I have talked about my loneliness on reddit before. You may have even read about me. I'm that 23 year old who hasn't had a single meaningful friendship since elementary school. I am still a virgin who has never been on a date or kissed a girl. I have never even asked a girl out because I have never flirted and am socially inept. I have even have an imaginary girlfriend as a coping mechanism for how bad I feel about myself when lonely in my studio every weekend night. I have had thoughts if ending it all before (before I found purpose in this new job I recently started that I deeply enjoy). \n\nWell...I tried \"just putting myself out there\". Since I recently started this nes job I was living in a completely new city, so I was hoping that maybe I could have a fresh start. Well...it wasn't exactly a pleasant experience. \n\nSo one of my co-workers (who has been working there for some time and has lived in Pittsburgh for a while so he has a good social life) said that he and his wife are having a party at his place and anyone from my company was invited to go. So, I decided to just give it a try and just \"come out of my shell\". I was even feeling some confidence in me. I dressed better than I usually do, and went. \n\nI was the only person from my company that went. Everyone else were either old friends of the co worker or friends of his wife from medical school. I tried making small talk but to absolutely no avail, and every failure made feel more shitty about myself. Nothing I said sounded interesting. None of my jokes are funny. Just like in my college days, my high school days, my middle school days, and even for the most part my elementary school days...I was a nobody when it came to socializing. I was that awkward kid in the corner. There were many ladies there, but i wasn't even trying to hit on any of them. I just wanted to try and make a friend maybe (guy or girl) but maybe I was asking too much for myself.\n\nAlso I had a hard time relating to all the stories. They were talking about how they had friends that did this or a girlfriend that does that or a date that went like this or a honeymoon that went like that. I mean I don't blame them. It's not like they I know I am basically a zygote when it comes to a social or romantic life. And if they knew, they would want to get away from me. \n\nAlso physically I felt insignificant. I am 5'8 and pretty much everyone was taller than me (some of them were in great shape). Even the women were taller than me. So yeah, I'm a total manlet too (when will I ever learn hahaha). \n\nSo yeah, in some ways a social setting made feel like even more of a loser than I do when alone (at least when I am alone I can distract myself from those thoughts with stuff I like). I tend to look forward to working, because my job is the one thing that gives my life meaning because it's in an industry I love (space robotics....not NASA but they give us funding) and it had for the most part ended my thoughts of ending it all...but unfortunately not entirely, because outside of work I have nothing to do that keeps me feeling purposeful. Noone outside my kin really cares about me, and in order to grow as a person I have to grow outside of my kin obviously. \n\nSo yeah. Here I am. I don't know what to do about it. And I am deeply ashamed to say it, but it does tear me up the more I realize this about myself. I feel like my ship has sailed. I feel like I am destined for this.\n\nSorry for getting melodramatic. \n\nTl;dr I tried socializing and it didn't work out and ended feeling lonelier.", "subreddit": "lonely"}

I'm drawn too them. I know I'm not broken like them, I think I know how I can help them, how I can change them to be better people. I'm talking about people who are depressed, have bipolar, borderline personality disorder and similar mental illnesses, my last 2 girlfriends (Ive had 3) have had these illnesses. I think it's because I'm egotistical, that they're not as healthy as they could be and I can make them better. It's horrible of me to think like this I know but I can't help it. I just want them to need me like I need them. \n\nIt also helps me work out how to act around them. I just think what would I want someone to do for me if I was in their position. So I try subtly manipulating them to act a certain way (the examples are long and complex but basically I change my mood or complain until they realise how they could fix it) and it works..for a while. Then when I do it too much the relationship breaks down, mostly because I realise what I'm doing is wrong and it isn't fair on them. But I keep doing it... \n\nThis is also kinda what I do in general. I can't make friends cos I don't see anyone as equal too me, they're either above or below me. If they're below me I not mean or anything to them I sorta just talk to them cos again if I were in their position I'd want them to do the same. If I see them as above me, I'm not afraid of them I just see them as \"too cool for me\". I do talk to them and laugh a little but it feels like they're faking it. Like they're just being nice, that they know what I want them to do and then they do it to make me happy. \n\nThis is similar with my parents and my bosses and teachers, i dont see them as cool, but I see them as people I need to impress. Not anyone i can be friends with. So i dont wanna talk to my mum about this cos it's some thing I gotta work out on my own. I just need to impress her. \n\nI know this is all irrational, I've been telling myself it for years, but I can't help it. \nI don't know why I wrote this, maybe I'm hoping someone else can relate.

I have friends online and around the world but no one in person to grab a coffee with, explore the city, get drinks with. Etc. \n\nI've tried looking into local meet ups but there aren't any geared towards people in their 20s. I've tried BumbleBFF. Every single person I've matched with has had potential, but it's like pulling teeth to get them to say anything. I'm asking all the questions and getting very short responses. The conversations are going nowhere and I'm losing hope. I'm doing my best to be open and interesting but I'm not getting it reciprocated. \n\nI feel so down today as a result and I don't know what to do. Is a coffee buddy too much to ask for?", "subreddit": "lonely"}

I dont what I do wrong. I cant tell if my apprence, my lack of social skills, my low self esteem, or my short height. I have many advice from my parents  or my therapist but they all they really tell me is forgot about the problem instead of trying to fix. \n\nSometimes I think mabye it just not meant for me after it all seems like I automatically ruin any chance with a girl.

No matter what society tells you don\u2019t go thinking because girls/guys aren\u2019t interested in you romantically and sexually, it means you\u2019re totally at fault and you deserve this fate. \n\nThe truth is most of us are just unattractive and there\u2019s only so much you can do to help that. And that\u2019s a hard pill to swallow. It definitely was for me because I bought into the idea that if I lifted, took care of myself, studied hard for a good career, and was a cool person to be around, the rest would follow suit. And yet despite my success in those areas it never did. My face is still clearly below average and I\u2019m 5\u20199 on a good day - those are things I can\u2019t change.  \n\nDo yourself a favor and make a tinder with some decent pics of yourself (the bio honestly doesn\u2019t matter much). If you have an impossible time trying to get matches then it\u2018s most likely not your shyness or introverted nature that\u2019s holding you back unfortunately.  And the thing that sucks is it really is a cycle that feeds into itself. When you\u2019re unattractive people don\u2019t gravitate towards you and don\u2019t want you around as much, and so you get excluded from social situations, friend circles, and relationships, all of which build your social skills and help in making you a better romantic candidate for the future. \n\nIt sucks but it\u2019s the world we live in. How attractive you are is nearly everything, and you might think that means I\u2019ve just given up but I haven\u2019t. Maybe this is something that\u2019s frowned upon here but I\u2019m planning on saving up for multiple facial procedures in the hopes that it\u2019ll be enough to at least get me \u201c in the game.\u201d A sliding genioplasty to fix my flat recessed chin. Undereye fillers for that hollow dark area under each of my eyes. Invisalign because my teeth while not bad could be better. All hopefully within the next 2 years. And despite the fact that I\u2019m already lean I\u2019ll probably have to get down even further to like 7% body fat to see if it makes a difference in my face. It\u2019ll be costly but in the grand scheme of things it\u2019s worth the effort and it\u2019s not going to kill me financially. \n\nAnd if none of that works...hey I tried. I did everything I could and at that point, I\u2019ll just focus on what I\u2019m interested in. Music, lifting, sports analytics/creating models for sports betting, investing, traveling, and my relationships with my good friends and family are all things that I truly live for regardless of the fact that society will see me as a loser. I think over time while that void of not having a romantic life will still always be there, it\u2019ll be more bearable.", "subreddit": "ForeverAlone"}

We are all alone to burden this pain, every single day, and that is something that people looking into our community will never understand. \n\nThis is a mental health crisis and needs to be treated as such. There needs to be more research done on exactly WHY we end up like this. Therapists need to be armed with a better toolbox to tackle these problems instead of telling the same cookie cutter responses you'd find on /r/sex.

She left me disillusioned, angry and depressed, and on my birthday. She triggered another mental breakdown of mine.\n\nWe had grown close about two years ago and I saw her as my new best friend. I was crushing on her but I knew to push it down and never entertain the thought of being in a relationship with her. I was happy with this arrangement. I mean beggars can't be choosers right? So we grew close over a summer, like we hung out every week and such. She was a very positive person and I mirrored her, if only so that I didn't drive her away with my problems. I'm now glad I never told her about most of my problems, though she did end up knowing about some of them, including that I was autistic and a little depressed.\n\nBut then about a year after we got close, it's like she wanted to avoid me at all cost.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* I read her entire book. Her ENTIRE BOOK of like 50 chapters. And they were long chapters. And I also gave critique on them. And then she couldn't find the time to read even 2 short chapters of mine.........\n* I never made a peep about my problems most of the time, but had to listen to her problems and give her advice.\n* The few times I messaged her, half the time she never responded. But when she messaged me I was always there to answer.\n* Whenever I baked something I would save some for her and her family. I gave her a gift for her birthday, one that she was incredibly happy with. I didn't get any gifts and did not expect any.\n* Whenever we wanted to hang out, there were just so many barriers coming from her. Sure she was pretty busy, but sometimes she'd say she could hang out, then say she couldn't, then say she could, then say she couldn't. Most times came with negotiations: \"Can we make it tomorrow?\" \\*Tomorrow\\* \"Can we make it next week?\" \"Actually can we go somewhere close to home? I can't spend so much time out actually because of this thing.\" \"Can we go somewhere closer to home and somewhere very boring even though I'm completely free?\"\n* For most of our 'friendship', she wasn't available to hang out for more than once in a blue moon. This was despite us attending the same university and living 10 minutes apart. She'd say 'oh I can't hang out for this month/2 months' or 'I'm afraid I'm not available for the foreseeable future cause of this entrepreneurship program.' Seriously who the fuck says to their close friend that they're not available for months and weeks at a time??\n* One time I wanted to invite her to my place. Where we live it's very Mediterranean so antipasti are a must. I had prepared all that food, and then she cancelled just before coming because it was drizzling outside. And then we postponed it to the next week. I bought another batch of food 2 days before to prepare and she cancelled again. And that's when I just abandoned ever inviting her to my place.\n* She never really integrated me with her other friends or invited me to hangout with them.\n* When she claimed she wasn't 'available', she was actually hanging out with her other friends. I know this cause she posted pictures and locations on facebook every time.\n* When my birthday came around she said she could hang out. Then it got postponed. Then inevitably came the negotiations I mentioned above. Then, she said she didn't 'feel' like hanging out., and made absolutely no effort to negotiate another date. That's how she basically abandoned me on my birthday.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAt university we pass by each other sometimes, she never looks me in the eye and I avoid her too.\n\nNo doubt she was very busy. She was actually a prodigy and very active in every possible sphere of life. I think I was just another person who got left behind in her persuit of work and education. It's really shaken me because she's always seemed like a nice, kind person but then she did those things to me.....

Some people are posting how lonely they are but that they are also miserable self-pitying and no fun to be around. What are we supposed to do with that? If nobody wants to be around and you and you make half-ass attempts at correcting your outlook and negativity what\u2019s the point in whining? What do you want from people? Obviously not a friend to share in things because you wouldnt give them the support they need.  When it\u2019s only about yourself then it\u2019s selfish to complain as well. If you are not someone others want to be around stop blaming society and stop giving each other a pass. Unless that\u2019s the kind of friend you want then by all means start your own group of angry dejected people who\u2019s only joy in life is complaining about how bad it is.

So I\u2019ve never really had many friends, and throughout all of HS I pretty much only had acquaintances. I have Aspergers so any kind of relationships of any kinda are kinda difficult for me. \n\nAnyway, I recently just finished my first semester of university, and while I was there I introduced myself to a girl who sat next to me in one of my classes. She was pretty quite and shy which I guess I was sympathetic towards. Anyway, eventually we kinda talked quite a bit and found we shared a lot of interests. We started walking to the bus together and talking quite a lot more, so I asked her out for coffee and she accepted. We then spend 2 hours there talking and I think it went alright. I guess at the time I kinda thought of it as a date while she did not. \n\nA week later I ask her if I could \"take her out\" to see a movie but she says she is too busy, essentially rejecting me. (Notice the \u201ctake her out\u201d is a lot more date like). The thing is though, the only reason I kinda asked her out, was that dating is the only way I knew how to progess a relationship, and I guess I did not mean that much from it. Afterwards she seemed to be kinda avoiding me, so I essentially told her about my intentions, and that I really did not mean much by asking her. I also told her I had Asperger meaning I struggle with these things. She assured me that I was probably overthinking (something I do have a habit of), and we then agree to be friends and things kinda go back to how they were. \n\nFast forward to a few weeks ago, when I texted her about exams, but it kinda evolved into a conversation. She seemed to reply quickly and with long responses. I then friend her on snap-chat. Yesterday she posted on her story about her obscure music taste, which I happened to share so I told her that she had a fine taste in music.\n\nAnyway, so theres my life story as context I guess... The point is I do really like her as a friend, but want to progress it to something a bit more than casual acquaintances, something I\u2019ve never really made it past. I know she loves the LOTRs, as do I, and I wanted to watch that with her, but I\u2019m not sure how to ask without giving off the wrong impression. I did ask before, if I could take her to see a movie, but it was at a time when she was busy, and I gave off the impression of trying to date, something she was not interested in. She is also going to go see her parents out of town for the Christmas break, but I\u2019m not sure when she gets back. \n\nSo what do you think? Is there any hope, even if probably not. I think it is worth trying, but I\u2019m not sure how at this point. I know I do have problems with relationships, and I\u2019m going to seek therapy over the break for the first time in my life, but I still would like to make a friend now. I also know I can\u2019t focus n just one person, and I plan to try to find more friends again next semester, but she was the only one I clicked with, and I\u2019m not going to be able to find anyone else until I get back to school. Any advice would be helpful.\n\nTLDR: Have not had friends for a very long time, but just finished my first semester of college and sorta clicked with one person. I tried to date her originally, since I honestly did not know any other way to progress relationships due to not having one for so long, (I also have Aspergers), but she was not looking for that, and I explained my intentions and we agreed to be friends. We share tons of interests and we get along well, so I\u2019d like to progress the relationship, but I don\u2019t really know how to. I recently friended her on Snapchat and we\u2019re sorta keeping in touch through that.

Brian and I go way back. Him and I went to high school together. We were in the same remedial math class and to make a long story short on this part of the story we instantly clicked. We started hanging out pretty much on a regular basis. Now I'll skip around a lot but basically our friendship was at it's strongest or I thought it was when we got older, early 20's. I'm 25 now. We both developed pretty severe anxiety and depression disorder. We could joke to each other and called ourselves clones because were so similar in the way that we thought. We made a lot of memories.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo there was a point when he moved pretty far away, still in the same state but a couple of hours away. We texted and talked on the phone pretty regularly as well. He got offered a job back in our home town and he came back. We made a lot of memories again, hanging out, smoking, getting drunk together, eating together, and we even made a short film once just for fun. It was pretty hilarious. There was a time when we didn't speak because I was hanging out with a group of people I shouldn't of been hanging out with and vice versa. Later on we agreed this happened because he could never do anything \"bad\" with me because he'd feel guilty for leading me down that path and vice versa. I'm definitely fa now but back then I used to hang out with a few people but it was basically with criminals and delinquents, nobody you ever want to get mixed with. It's proof that I am fa if anything because when you get so desperate you'll hang out with just about anyone with a beating heart.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSome how though, our friendship would always come back full circle. We damn near almost physically fought a few times, had many petty arguments but in the end we always got back cool again. He got married to his middle school and highschool sweat heart and we'll call her Brianna. (Not her actual name) They were inseparable. The whole thing was, no offense to her but she was super clingy, even after a few years into their relationship. Every time he wanted to hang out with me, she would never let him have his own space and do that.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSome days he said screw it and came to hang out with me but it was mostly when they were in a fight. If they weren't, chances of us hanging out were slim to none. I remember hanging out with him and his wife would blow him up. What was supposed to be a few hours of hanging out, would turn into a short 20-30 minutes. People might say that I should've been grateful that he wanted to hang out with me period but we barely hung out because he was so \"busy\" so to me 30 minutes felt like 3 minutes. Time flies when you're having fun as well. This become a habitual thing.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThings changed when he got his cdl a license to become a truck driver, which I was so proud of don't get me wrong. He had come a long way from working petty janitorial jobs just to cover up next month rent in a small studio apartment with his girl. I'll admit, he had a valid reason to say he was busy when he became a truck driver but in the same token I just felt like it became a one street friendship. It seemed like I always had to beg, not literally beg but always ask to hang out. He would constantly tell me \"we'll see.\" Or he'd agree and even set up a date and flake out on me. He wouldn't flake out by saying \"oh I'm sorry man, can't make it.\" He'd completely go ghost on me for a few days just to tell me he couldn't chill.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI found that so disrespectful. So partly he was so busy because of his job but it was also because his wife but he lives with his wife so I didn't believe he was so busy that it excused him from flaking out on me all the time. The times that he flaked out on me were when he was completely free. The thing was, it's not like the wife and husband like you think it is. Most people right now may think I'm wrong but at the end of the day a person claims to be free on this day, claims to be your best friend, you expect them to show up or at least have the decency to tell me he couldn't make it. They're married, I get that but it was honestly like a bf and gf living together with the married label because they had zero kids, and they lived together even when they were just bf and gf and nothing changed in their relationship. The only thing that changed was our friendship.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHe would constantly fake on me and I would constantly forgive him. Why? It's because even to this day,where we haven't spoke in months, there is not one other single person that I related to more then him. I could express as raw as I do on here and he wouldn't judge me at all. He was really my best friend, someone I saw like a brother. Blood couldn't of made us any closer. He was closer to me then his actual blood brothers. This last stent of him going ghost is what put the nail in the coffin to our friendship. So basically we hadn't talked in a while but as I said earlier, our friendship always came back full circle and we'd get cool again. Not this time though. We caught up and talked for an hour over the phone.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe agreed to hang out on a certain day and time. That day came and not only did he flake but he just completely went ghost on me. This was like 2-3 months ago. I still have not heard a peep out of him. I've hit him up since numerous times, and nothing. Now I did say f you to him the same day he flaked to not leave any details out but in fairness and in my defense we'd talk each other like that frequently and that would never stop either one of us from replying. Knowing him, I would've expected him to cuss me back out or simply apologize and we'd be friends again. It's either one or the two but he went fully awol on me. Or did he? I tried to convince myself that something terrible had happened to him, not because I'm a sadistic bastard and wanted that to be true but I was telling myself that there was no way he'd do this to me. Then I realized he was doing it to me my entire friendship. He deleted his facebook long before this happened so it was hard to confirm whether he was flat out ignoring me which he doesn't do or if something tragic happened to him.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhen you forgive someone so much they take you for granted. I even contacted his gf to see what was going on with him, I mean wife (just used to calling her his gf) on snap chat. She looked like she was typing back but the chat bubbles went away and she eventually left me on read. I accepted that we would never be friends again before I contacted her. We related so much that we were almost just as toxic to each other. We enabled our mental illness to each other. I just wanted some closure. Maybe something did happen to him, maybe he finally flaked out in the worst way he possibly could. Maybe I did something wrong but I just didn't realize it. I guess I'll never know. Some times I wonder if one day he'll randomly call or text me, even if it's months or even years from now and how I'd respond. Would I express anger towards him? Would I just be happy that he's okay and alive? If he really did go full ghost on me, would I forgive him again? These burning questions will haunt me for a long time. At least he had his wife. Maybe these questions will haunt me because I needed him way more then he needed me unfortunately. He had his ride to die, I didn't. I guess I kind of relied on him in that way.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThank you for reading. We were so relatable like I said that I would not be surprised whatsoever if he was lurking on this sub as well. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nedit: I called him, thru an app number. He picked up and he said hello. I said hello and hung up straight away. Wtf. Whatever. He better not try to get back cool with me ever again.

My parents try to persuade me to focus on my career, but for what? For whom? What will I do it for? For the future? The future that is not even guaranteed? I left my college after her death and naturally lost all my friends. I keep to myself all the time. I haven't talked to anyone in a long time. I feel so lonely.", "subreddit": "lonely"}

I feel like I was made to be social, I was made to build connections, I was made to make people laugh and feel good and be there for them. I\u2019m an extrovert and always willing to be a people person as I mentioned. But all this aside, I (M18) feel like this life isn\u2019t worth it... I\u2019ve never been in a relationship nor have I ever been intimate with a person on a deeper level. Shoot, I haven\u2019t even had my first kiss yet. And it kind of hurts because I\u2019m in college, I look good, and all the other good stuff but I feel like my youth is being wasted because I\u2019ve never dated or hooked up with somebody before. My friends are getting attention and they all have their own kinds of relationships and I\u2019m here, just kind of watching them and supporting them, in hopes one day I can be as happy or as lucky as them. Is my social image / standing really worth it when indeed I truly feel alone? Everyday I have nothing and no one to look forward to seeing. This is probably why im a people person and always like to be social, because I have nothing besides that...? I feel so unwanted and ugly and feel like everything I try and do will amount to nothing. I\u2019m not even looking for sex or anything like that, just someone who I can cuddle with and tell my problems and just be there for them and care for them in any way that I can. I just feel so alone and want something before my youth ends or at least learn something so I\u2019m not old as f*ck and naive when it comes to relationships and love. Any tips, or ideas as to why this is so? Thanks &lt;3", "subreddit": "lonely"}

{"post_id": "ec9l3w", "created_utc": 1576655304, "title": "Long Rant", "author": "favan17", "self_text": "I was on Tinder for over a year at my university. I swiped right on maybe 80% of people, and I did so much swiping. Once I actually did get a match with a really cute looking girl that had a really friendly bio. She unmatched me just a few minutes after I messaged her. Somehow that felt even worse to me than getting no matches at all. I cried about it for awhile.\n\nI thought that maybe Tinder just wasn't good at my school for meeting people. I actually made myself feel a bit better. Then I was talking with my friend, who had recently broken up with his girlfriend, and he casually mentioned that he had gotten over 50 tinder matches in the one month that he was single (before he met someone else). Another friend, overhearing, told me that he had over 70 matches.\n\nMy friend got 50 matches in one month, and I had 2 from over a year, with both of them unmatching me without a word. I don't really know what's wrong with me. I know me being 5'7 is pretty bad for my chances, but plenty of other guys that are 5'7 have girlfriends - what am I doing wrong? I've been going to the gym consistently for over 4 years, and I think my face is at least average.\n\nA few months ago I talked to my psychiatrist about my issues. I told her about how I used to spend time with my friends at our dorm lounge, but I stopped because so many of them got into relationships and would bring their girlfriends to the lounge, and it would make me sad, so I isolated myself in my room instead. She told me to be more confident and try Bumble over Tinder, and offered to up my anti-depressant dosage.\n\nI'm halfway through my senior year now. I'm going to graduate without having ever held a girl's hand. \n\nLast Valentine's day, my roommate woke up late and hurriedly asked one of our friends to drive him to a store so he could buy gifts for his girlfriend, since he forgot Valentine's day was that day. It genuinely shocked me that he was able to forget about it. I honestly can't imagine ever forgetting to spend Valentine's day with my girlfriend. It would be something I prepare for weeks in advance. The thought that people can think of something like Valentines Day so carelessly is legitimately alien to me.\n\nI even felt anger at my roommate. \"How come he is the one with a girlfriend when he treats his relationship so carelessly\", I thought. But I know that these thoughts are toxic, and that I can't allow myself to be controlled by them - yet this becomes harder to do each and every day.\n\nI spent a good chunk of that day crying - not in my own room, though, because my roommate was spending time with his girlfriend there. I went somewhere else.\n\nI feel like I could be so much more successful in my life if I had a girlfriend. Right now, my motivation for doing things is worsening every day. When I first entered university, I would do all my assignments right as they were assigned, and would have no problem going to class and devoting time to my studies. Now it's my senior year and I barely can put in the minimal effort required. I rarely go to class. I honestly think that if I had a girl hold my hand and tell me that she was proud of me, and that she thought I was smart and hardworking, I could get just as much work done as I did my freshman year. But I don't.\n\nI don't really know what I'm going to do when I graduate. I think for my sake I have to try to put myself out there one last time. Once I get a job, I'll save up for a car, and when I have one I'll try every dating site there is. If after that I still can't get a girlfriend I don't know what I'll do.\n\nTo anyone who read all this, thanks. Obviously I'm not expecting any advice as there's none to give.

She asked why and I explained that I was really into her her rebuke was disappointing. We parted and I went to the gym and then home. Life kept going.

I think it's likely the people who wrote the Bible knew a little something about unbearable suffering.\n\nSo, if you're not familiar with the story, Job is a wealthy man with a big family and a righteous heart.  God decides one day to strip Job of everything he has.  He loses his fortune, his children die, and his wife abandons him.  Job's body is covered in excruciating boils and he spends his days in agony.  Through the course of the story, Job never learns the reason why God has done this.  Actually, the reason is arguably extremely petty (Satan makes a wager with God that Job would not be such a righteous person if he lost everything he had), but the pettiness is not really important to the story.  What is important is how Job reacts to the tragedy.\n\nJob's friends learn of what has happened to him, and they implore the *just world hypothesis*.  They essentially tell him, \"There must be something you have done wrong for all to happen to you.  No one has such a wretched existence unless they themselves are partially the cause.\"  Job's friends are maybe like some of the non-helpful normies who visit this page : P .\n\nThe part that I want to emphasize here is that **Job remains adamant that he did not do anything wrong.  He knows in his heart that he is a good person, and that he is not to blame for what has happened.  He does not succumb to self hatred, or blame himself.**  Nor does he curse God and all existence for his suffering.  He does, however, demand an answer from God to know why he is being tormented.  God never gives him the answer he seeks.  But he does restore Job's wealth, unites him with a new wife, and Job lives to see his great grand-children.\n\nOne thing I take from the book of Job is this message: when you suffer terribly, either your own choices have contributed in some way to your suffering, or you are blameless.  **Suffering is far easier to bear when you are blameless**.  It is so much worse to suffer knowing that part of the reason you are suffering can be laid at your own feet.  You may disagree and say \"It doesn't matter one way or the other, suffering is the same whether it's partly your fault or not.\"  I am sure you don't really believe that: if an earthquake destroys your home and you lose your home and fortune, that is horrible.  If you drunkenly gamble your money away and lose the same, it is unimaginably worse.  Not only do you have to live with the tragedy, you also have to live every day with the fact that it's your own damn fault.  The suffering you experience from the tragedy of life is nothing compared to the suffering you experience when you know you should have done things differently.\n\nSo if you are forever alone, and your loneliness causes you to suffer unbearably, what you might do to possibly ease the burden of your suffering is to sit on the edge of your bed and ask yourself, earnestly and without any pretense of self-indulgence or self-hatred: *Am I blameless in my suffering?  Am I like Job, who was good but suffered anyway from the tragedy of unpredictable existence?  Or can part of the reason I'm suffering unbearably be laid at my own feet?*\n\nMaybe you are like Job.  I bet plenty of people who read this are.  Maybe you lost the genetic lottery, and lost it hard. Maybe you had a traumatic childhood.  Things in the universe have transpired to make you, you, and there is nothing you can do but accept that you will be alone forever.  Take comfort that you are blameless.  The tragedy that resulted in you being this way is the same as the tragedy of the earthquake that destroyed a man's house.  Or the smallpox that ravaged a village.\n\nOr maybe, you do bear some responsibility in your suffering.  Maybe there is something you were doing, or were not doing, that resulted in you being what you are.  If you agree that you bear some responsibility for your suffering, see what can be done about righting your wrongs.  Do everything you can so that you can escape your unenviable position.  Become as close as you can to being blameless like Job.  Let things be that nothing more can be laid at your own feet.  And see what happens.", "subreddit": "ForeverAlone"}

That is one of the benefits of being alone, the very low number of gifts I have to buy. Anyways, I stopped at a convenience store to buy a snack, and upon making my selection at the deli, the female clerk (she looked not anymore older than early 20's) rang up my order and because I was the only one in line at the time started to chat with me about my selection. She was very nice and well mannered, a people person, she obviously or it seems likes her job. She seemed very genuine.\n\nI had put down a bag of potato chips on the counter and she rang it up. She looked at the bag and said she would have to try that new flavor of chips. I said it looked good and that I like to try different types of snack foods. The other item was a fried burrito, she asked me if I had ever tried dipping my burrito in ranch sauce, to which I told her \"No\", and I never thought of trying that. I had a small container of cheese sauce, so she said I needed to try it, that it was a good combination. I thought about it, but declined the offer. However she was enthusiastic about me trying it, and that I would enjoy it. She then offered me a packet of ranch sauce. I thought about it, then took the packet, because I was going to try it. I told her I was willing to try new flavor combos and I meant it. She smiled when I took it, I like to believe that because she was happy I was trying something different, it made her happy. She had a great smile. You can get vibes off of people as to whether they are the real deal or just phonies. My perception was, a happy go lucky gal.\n\nSo my purchase was nine dollars and some change. I gave her a twenty dollar bill and she gave me back my change which included a ten dollar bill. As I picked up my bags of goodies, she told me, \"You will like it, it's good.\" I said to her, \"I think I will\", and turned to leave, but before walking away, I wanted to do something for her, so I gave her the ten dollars.\n\nYou should have seen the smile on her face then. It got even bigger, and asked was I serious about giving her the change? I sure was, and she looked very appreciative of the gift. She thanked me, and I walked away saying, \"No, thank you for the suggestion and Merry Christmas\". I didn't look back and say anything else, because I didn't want anything more than the good feeling that I perhaps brightened up a moment for her at work.\n\nThis time of the year is very difficult for me, being single and alone. A little conversation, even if it is part of your job to ask, and if it isn't anything more than hey have you tried this, or you will like it, or simply how is your day today, and look like you are interested in the answer goes a long way.\n\nShe will never know what she did for me, because that little interaction made my day.", "subreddit": "ForeverAlone"}

I'm a really socially awkward dude, and I'm really terrible at conversations, especially with girls .\n\n The first two times we met up, it was pretty awkward, but nevertheless we managed to talk a little about our common shared interests. The last few times I have started to come out of my shell a little bit, made her laugh a couple of times, but still we haven't gotten to know each other on a personal level very well, mostly because of my lingering debilitating social anxiety and my buddy has always been the one igniting the conversations as he is a very sociable and outgoing person.

What I have heard tho is that one of these dudes made a move on her, and she politely rejected him saying that they should just remain friends, and this guy started stalking her, it became a whole ordeal and she eventually blocked him.

So my delusional ass thought that I was actually on the verge of escaping fa. So get this.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI quit online dating for a long time, for obvious reasons. Average to below average guys know what I'm talking about. So I won't write an essay explaining all of the reasons. Out of sheer boredom, knowing what results I'd probably be getting, I hopped back on. The site/app is called meetme but I was using the desktop version.So the obvious things were happening, which me messaging a bunch of girls and nobody responding. One actually responded. My initial thought from my experience was she was a bot or a fake webcam model trying to have me sign me up on their bullshit site and cause my computer to catch a bunch of viruses and what not.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe asked for my number. I start texting her. Immediately I knew that she was an actual person. She had pics on her profile and it said she was 19. You'll get why her being 19 on the profile is important. As we were texting I had an overwhelming feeling of nervousness but she called me handsome and it seemed like we were hitting it off. In my head I was like, is this a dream? I have not talked to an attractive girl in forever, let alone them showing any bit of interest in me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI did everything right, even though I'm pretty much socially retarded. I was like I can't blow this chance. Even if I had to fake it till I make it, I wasn't going to let this blow up in my face if I could help it. I didn't know when I'd ever get this kind of opportunity again. So I was texting very concise, no stupid small talk and I was telling her about myself, not double texting, waiting 20 minutes to reply back whenever she took like 30 minutes to reply. Basically I was doing everything right. So then I ask let's go out for coffee some time. She responds saying \"I need to tell you something first.\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nDo you know what she said? She told me that she was only 16. I'm 25 years old. I was like oh hell nah. I told her she shouldn't falsify her age like that. I know that she's young so she may not know any better about the consequences for the men that she's talking to but I told her that what she's doing it s wrong and that she needs to delete her app asap. I told her that she was going to get a lot of guys caught up..In the back of my head, I knew this was way too good to be true. I knew something had to be wrong.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIn all of my years of online dating, 99 percent of women all ignored me. I've never had an attractive women carry on a conversation with me. I knew her talking to me in the first place was the biggest red flag of all, probably the only red flag that I needed. This is why I'm forever alone. It's because whenever I get these rare what seems to be opportunities, it ends up just being a big joke. I'm just a cosmic joke. It's no wonder she found me attractive at 16. I'm a man child that can't do anything for himself, should've known. I even told her that if she was older she would've rejected me or ghosted me anyways.

Not in the relationship department at least. I made lots of posts here and sometimes I get messages asking about my current status so I'm making this last post in hopes if people see my other posts they'll also see this one and won't have to question me.\n\nI'm not looking for any type of relationship anymore. No romance, no friendships, no nothing. It's just not healthy for me anymore. I've been looking for friends regularly for over a decade and the results always start or end bad regardless of how good I try to be. I kept trying longer than I should have and it caused more harm than good. \n\nI decided the best thing I can do for myself is live in solitude to salvage and restore my mental and emotional state. I'm not bitter or upset but I no longer have the desire to know anyone or to be known. I just want to make money, buy what I want, go where I want &amp; do what I want. I've had enough with the constant disappointment, heartbreak and abandonment. It's just not worth it at this point. Normally I take whatever time needed for some sense of recovery or vent here because I have no one else and occasionally have people discredit my problems because I'm a woman (**nice guys by the way**) I thought since being lonely was a broad issue all genders were welcome but that doesn't appear to be the case so maybe a separate sub is needed.\n\nI don't know who or what gave me the idea that things will get better when I recovered from depression but I can't continue with life wondering whose last choice I'm going to be. Don't tell me to keep trying because it's not rational. Every time I gave up someone wanted me to give them a chance and I gave in and ended up making the same wrong choice. I always end up wrong when I deviate from my decision and I refuse to make anymore mistakes. I know not everyone is the same but I can't trust me or anyone else anymore. I think it's absurd to think since there are 7 billion people in the world that there's someone for everyone.\n\nI feel like my family is cursed. Doomed to be alone or to wonder into relationships one after another just to be abandoned or treated poorly. No one in my family has friends and the ones in romantic relationships are not satisfied but keep it going just so they won't be alone. I hope no one in my family will have children so when everyone dies the family line will be done and it'll finally be over. It's the only thing I know that can make things alright and prevent future suffering. I will never commit suicide or encourage others to do so but I recognize there really are some things only death can fix. I feel like I'm genetically designed to be tossed or ignored regardless of what I do. There is absolutely no value in being different. Whoever says so is a liar.\n\nI tried to start off fresh but I can't do that with another person. I hope by the time technology advances to address this problem I'll still be alive.\n\nAccepting I'm gonna someday leave this world as if I never existed was initially a tough pill to swallow but since then I feel a weird sense of relief as if I don't have to do anything about it now. I have found a sense of contentment (or complacency) in the world but I know I most likely won't find the type of happiness I truly wanted to achieve.\n\nWhen I die I want to be cremated and if possible have the ashes destroyed as well. I feel like I've been screwed since birth to be an undesirable reject and dying is the only way to cleanse it away.\n\nI don't know if reincarnation exists but if I am to be reborn I just want to have a normal life and relationships like the majority of society instead of instead of being entangled in this web of absurdity  and solitude I have to handle myself.\n\n**If you read this and think \"I wanna talk to this person\" or \"I wanna try to be this person's friend.\" I implore you not to.** I couldn't stop myself from wasting my time but I can at least try to prevent you from wasting yours.\n\n\nWhile this might seem majorly depressing or alarming for anyone that's reading but this is only mildly saddening for me. A sniffle here, a sob there then I put on my big girl pants and get back in the game to deal with things as adults are expected to. =/ I'm not trying to be patronizing. I really would love to throw a pity party and have someone console me it's not gonna happen and I can't delude myself again into thinking it will happen someday.\n\nI wish there was somewhere besides my imagination to escape to. The internet was better in the early 2000's when not that many of people were on it. Back then escaping your problems with the internet was easy but now since the nature of society has changed and lots of people are on the net there's no where to escape to.\n\nI think I made this too long to the point no one will read this so I might delete this and type it over so it's more coherent.

I left home a week after my 17th birthday and have always made my way. I've never asked for or taken anything from anyone. Even getting a gift makes me extremely uncomfortable. I can't stand the touch of another human being. Even a hug makes my skin crawl. Apart from a few brief relationships (the last was 24 years ago) I have been alone. I'm now 63. The thing that has kept me going is that I have had an incredibly varied life. I've lived and worked all over the country in very diverse occupations. I always had a plan. Now, I have no more plans. My friends have dwindled to occasional phone calls. Its me, my dog and cat. All three of us are old. I absolutely dread losing my dog. I find my eyes filling with tears at any time of the day - I could be working, driving, at a store. Actually a good part of my life has revolved around animals of all kinds. Without them I wouldn't know what it's like to love someone else.. When these two guys are gone I seriously think it's time for me to go as well. Without animals I am selfish and self centered.\n\nThe trouble is that deep inside I never wanted to be alone. I wanted to love and be loved. I wanted an active social life, but even in my younger days when I was an attractive man and had no shortage of opportunities, I wasn't able to get close to anyone. As an old man I've convinced myself that my dislike for other humans is justified. I've pointed to all the evil things they do, but I know there are also good people - I just was never able to get close to them.\n\nIt's like getting hit with a ton of bricks when you're too old to change the personality that is deeply ingrained. Opportunities for making friends get fewer and fewer. My work life is coming to an end. My back is so shot that I can't stand for 15 minutes. I have had times when my life was fulfilling, but those slipped away and I can't see regaining them. So what is this future I'm looking forward to? A bitter old man, living alone in virtual poverty?

Things will only get better once they start changing, and that can be so random, it's unreliable to stress on a singular point.\n\nSee, big bro here is smart. First thing he learnt is how to be comfortable being alone and lonely. two really different things, but once you've got the hang of waking up and smiling for no particular reason than being alive, and looking forward to your independent day, then you're well on your way.\n\nIt was hard at first, yknow? I always felt like i needed someone, or that i couldn't go on without someone. Then I'd hit the sack, wake up, and find myself in another day. an' before you know it, the week goes by, and you're livin'.\n\nyeah-i know, i do have some hobbies now, and i sure do treasure my family, and it really helps, but whenever Im alone, I can look in the mirror and smile, knowing that I am all I need, will ever need in any given situation, and that me and my thoughts will think towards tomorrow.\n\nand the pain just doesn't come anymore.\n\nso chin up bud, eh? tomorrow comes, we all live, and sooner than you'll know it, you might find yourself somewhere completely different, wearing a new expression. you got this.", "subreddit": "lonely"}

My team and I got an A and had a fun time doing it, but the whole time my brain was more or less forced to acknowledge the presence of someone I\u2019ve been trying to get over for a while now. The story with her is long and complicated, but the short version is just that I love her and have invested so much into her and she said she loves me back but can\u2019t be in a relationship due to past experiences and mental afflictions. I haven\u2019t been speaking to or trying to look at her for almost 3 weeks, and today it was really rough. I almost cried off the makeup my team put on me. \n\nI walked home by myself once school got out and played Counter Strike for what I can only guess was around 3-4 hours. I was doing terribly today, worse than normal. Eventually I lost the motivation to speak and spoke very rarely in my last couple of matches, only using my mic to apologize when I lost a clutch and disappointed my teammates. \n\nWinter Break is about 3 weeks long and I have no one to talk to. No one to text, nothing like that. Right now I\u2019ve felt more isolated than ever and have been crying in my bed writing this. I don\u2019t really expect or care if anyone does read this, I just really want to share my thoughts somehow. Last night I stooped as low as to listen to ASMR where a girl talks about how much she loves you just so I could feel calm enough to fall asleep. \n\nI just really wish I had someone, would rather it be the girl I mentioned, but it doesn\u2019t have to be romantic I guess.

I don't seek too much attention. Mostly because there aren't people to give it to me in my life buuut that's neither here nor there. \n\nI turned 26 last week. Didn't get really any messages. Just a text from my father reminding me I am off his insurance now and to look into it, along with a few facebook posts from people who don't talk to me any other day in the year. Recently my boyfriend, the only person who I think cares whether I'm breathing still or not, moved to be with sick family in Colombia. So now I'm alone. I had a mental break and didn't work for 1.5 months. I'm a flight attendant. The thought of helping people, being happy when I am not, stuck on a loud plane with no escape, and dealing with difficult passengers taking their travel stress out on me caused a wild panic attack every time I went to call back in. I got my doctor to sign off on the call out so I wouldn't get in trouble and I'll return to work in the new year. However.. All this time laying in bed, usually in the dark, getting heavier, and watching what little I had in savings drain away.. It's been hard. And now I don't have my boyfriend to talk to on my \"dark days\" because he's busy in another country and so here I am. lonely.\n\nI just needed someone. A (kinda lame) reddit search of \"I am so lonely\" brought me here. I was hoping one of you could tell me it's normal to be this old and this alone? If not normal, at least that I'm not the only one. My thoughts are getting bad and dark and a little scary again, bf isn't here, and I feel like a little confirmation someone cares what I am thinking would go a long way tonight. Ok, that's all.

Grew up in a quiet California suburb filled mostly with other Asians, I studied, I put my head down, I did everything right and I ended up where I am today. 31, no dates, no kisses, not even a single indication of interest. Yeah I have a good job but who gives a shit? \n\nBut sometimes I wonder what could have been if I weren't on the straight and narrow. Most of my friends were like me, and between us (and most of the school, to be fair) it wasn't strange to have graduated without having so much as kissed someone. One particular friend who we'll call Jeff was someone I used to consider the brother I never had. We were the best of friends all throughout elementary and some of middle school, then we both just mutually drifted apart. Jeff joined the \"rough\" Vietnamese guys that were part of an alleged gang, and I stuck with the geeks. Sophomore year of high school we started talking more and one day he invited me to spend a weekend with him and his friends. I knew it wasn't going to be a normal day because that Saturday morning Jeff's older brother drove us 90 minutes out to this desert town called Palmdale. While there, we found out a friend of the brother had a shooting range that was for some reason not open to the public on a Saturday. Jeff's brother treated me like any one of the other guys, he taught me how to be safe with a gun and how to shoot one. After the first round I let out this awkward \"woo!\" and after I put the gun down and took off my hearing protection he asks me if shooting felt good. After I said yes, he said \"that's what being in with us feels like. It feels like a gun. How about you feel like that every day for the rest of your life?\" They had guns, they had drugs (study drugs, weed, I saw a bit of coke), they had money, they oozed of cool the way I wished I was, they had girls of all races that thought they were sexy. They had everything I want, and sadly it's everything I still want sometimes. I must have looked like a deer in the headlights because he laughed at me and told me to relax and that I don't have to say anything immediately. I never did see Jeff's brother again, and last I heard he was convicted of running illegal video poker machine games in the back of a minimart (not joking). And though Jeff and I still talked a lot throughout high school, it was clear we both accepted that I just didn't fit in with his brother and friends. But if I knew I still wouldn't fit in anywhere all these years later, I would have tried to fit in with those guys. It's really funny how the last group of people I really felt were giving me a chance and looking past my flaws were a group of people who others deemed a \"bad influence\" and \"failures\"", "subreddit": "ForeverAlone"}

I am almost at the end of my first semester at college, i was once alone, then i had a little sister and my life was much better. My dad passed away when i was 10 and that really took at toll later down my life. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI was once like you guys, alone and depressed, because nobody understood the feeling of confinement, being sad that no matter how you explain it, people just don't understand how social rejection has an impact on your life. I use to think about what i said that day, or how i looked, how other people thought i was cringy and stupid. I used to obsess over these minor and insignificant things during the day and it made me fucking sad. Most people don't understand. They don't understand how it feels to bear the pain of social pressure ( Peer pressure should freeze in hell along with the rest of the degeneracy on this earth). To care what people think and get hurt over \"insults\" from the \"bullies\" at school, when in reality they were just playfull jokes that you took too seriously like a jackass. I used to cry myself to sleep and fill the pillows with tears like a little fucking baby cause life was just too much. And then.... i snapped. Looking back i don't see how i didn't see this earlier.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n It was at the end of my last year in high school. That day we were getting our diplomas, getting the ceremonies done and all the formalities, ect ,ect you get the point. I looked around in class and realised... \"jees.... i'm never gonna see these people in my life ever again\". It dawned on me that all the bullshit over these four years, all my socially awkward encounters during my high school, all my crappy exchanges with my crushes, all of my embarrassing moments, ALL OF THOSE MOMENTS....  were ultimately MEAN-ING-LESS in the grand scheme of things. I realised that i, officially, am an adult now, i will have to go to college, i will have to find a job, i will have to find a wife down the line, i will have to have kids, i will have to grow old, and i will have to finally end my sorry, pathetic excuse of an existence at some point. So i fucking snapped because i realised that i didn't care about these people in class because i never in reality have. So i asked myself, is the opposite true aswell? and when you think about it, it absolutely motherfucking is. Not one of these assholes cared about what i said that day, or what i dressed like, or what i thought, nooone cared because my life is insignificant, and everyone looks out for them selves. Why should you care what others say or think, when none of them actually care?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf it helps, i have developed a coping mechanism for the madness of our world. Whenever something bad happens to me or somethings just don't work out... i laugh. At first it was a forced laugh, then it developed instinctivly, so now i just laugh naturally and i feel much better. You have no idea how laughing at how pathetic you are or how dumb you look will actually make you feel better. Hell, it's even helped me quit porn( for now ). I turn on the news and see all this fucked up shit, i laugh. I read on the internet how some company is scamming some dumb people, i laugh. I even laugh at how small my fucking dick is and how i will never get laid. I have basically become the joker minus the killing part ( yet )  :).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis state of thinking has greatly boosted my self esteem. It has given me the clarity to focus on what really matters. My goals in life. No longer do i waste my time rethinking conversations i've had with colleagues or girls, because frankly, i don't care weather i sound like a lunatic or a genius. Much more people have come to admire me because of my unrivaled confidence and honesty. Obviously people still don't care about me, but i have gotten accustomed to having a normal conversation with women, men, teachers, colleagues and anyone without making it awkward because i don't care if its awkward anymore. My mentality in terms of women has changed. I don't fantasize about every girl i meet in my life anymore. I see them as people now, not as some sex objects or some godly entities that can make no mistake. The trick for this is simply telling yourself this: I WILL NEVER HAVE SEX WITH \\*insert girl\\* EVER IN MY LIFE, SO I SHOULD STOP THINKING ABOUT IT AND LOOK AT HER AS A FRIEND. It does wonders. \n\nAnd it pains and disgust me, that i see some of you people be 20, 23, 26, 30...40 even, behave like little kids and  glorify relationships and women to the point of delusion. Don't you see that all of this is just a terrible joke? Your life will end some point and when you grow old all the memories of your 20's and 30's would be just you pittying yourself, and being self loathing over and over every day? You need to realise that your life doesn't end with you finding a girlfriend. What happens then? What if you guys argue too much? What if she isn't how you thought she was? \n\nRelationships are WAY TOO overrated, so please, for your own sake, get yourself out of this self destructive attitude and get a grip. Being a man and an adult is about controlling your emotions, not them controlling you and dictating your life. Thats what maturity is, and you will never be happy, be it with yourself or with a loved one, until you finally mature.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI personally don't plan on discussing much on this subreddit, so i will leave this here.

Got an eyeglass prescription back in July and it's already dated.\n\n\\- My asthma is more noticeably aggressive. I never had winter asthma in my life, now, whenever the temperature dips past -10C (14F) I start wheezing after less than 20 minutes. I remember as a kid going for walks in -30C (-22F) with no issue. I also get attacks much easier.\n\n\\- I can get chest pains. Had ECG's but they showed nothing. It's felt in the lower left of my chest and in my upper back as well. No issues like this prior.\n\n\\- I have developed significant memory loss. For instance, I don't remember almost anything from my childhood at all. I also find it harder to visualize things that have happened. This might have to do with the development of schizophrenia though, which also got more aggressive.\n\nFor reference, my living situation is very similar to solitary confinement though. No friends, no relationships, no job, no money, no car, borderline house-bound because the area I live in is very cold in winter. Keep in mind, all of these issues happened within the past 8 months, which is how long I've been practically house-bound as I was back from college in April.\n\nI didn't believe the whole \"Mental health impacts physical health\" that much prior to this I'll be honest.

I don\u2019t really ask my parents for gifts anymore because they\u2019ve done so much for me already, currently putting me through university, feeding and housing me. We\u2019re not poor, but I still feel bad if I asked them for luxuries that aren\u2019t critical to my life.\n\nNever really cared for gifts during Christmas time, although I do enjoy them. Totally random, but I started getting into watches, I love them, I bought a few nice ones already, and now I\u2019m hoping to buy an Omega Seamaster or Rolex OP one day soon. Throughout the past christmases in my life, I was always forced to be with my family and I was just miserable, I wanted to be alone. This year I might just skip out, I have a key for my university\u2019s piano practice rooms so I\u2019m planning to just lock myself in there for Christmas and practice. Sorry for the long rant, happy holidays.", "subreddit": "lonely"}

Got back in therapy and started meds again, signed up to see a psychiatrists. During this time my friend gets into a relationship and I become non-existent. I have terrible crippling anxiety so I could only hang out with her one-on-one. SO obvisously she stopped inviting me to social gatherings long ago. But that's ok because I never feel welcomed anyway. Despite all that I still cherished the time I got with her. Helped her move into her boyfriends, loved her, supported her, even putting her needs before mine at times. In this time I still feel that she is m other-half, but things aren't the same. It became easier for her to roll me off other her shoulders in a disagreement. She was there for me emotionally anymore. One night some guy was messaging me trying hit on me and randomly brings up the fact that my ex cheated on me all the time. This brought back terrible memories, and I began to fee really depressed and sick to my stomach. I text my 'bestfriend' in hopes to get a little love, because I knew that would make me feel better. Even though we were already texting each other, when I brought up feeling like shit because of my ex Jacob, she completely ghosted for the rest of the evening. I was calm with it, and even expected it because I knew she was with her boyfriend. The next morning, I was expecting a response from her, because all she does is play on her phone and laptop at work, but nothing. She had nothing to say until I brought it up again. She then gave me a short unmeaningful paragraph, basically saying she said all that she could say to me about the matter, and if I can't work it out on my own, I should talk to my therapist about it. That of course angered me further and more questionable things were said on her end. She never wants to be around me when I'm feeling low because 'it brings her down' but vise versa, i'm there for her to listen, to cheer her up, to be there. I've always been the more passive person in our relationship because she is so easily rattled and vicious. Most things would go her way because I'm more laid back and don't really care as along as we're together but also there were things I didn't want to do but did it anyway. Like the last time we saw each other, I'm not a big drinker because I act a fool and feel the effects for days after. But that night she just randomly sprung that she wanted to get drunk that night, so we did. I took a cab home and everything was fine... until the next morning. I realized that I forgot my purse and I was urgent to get it back as it had my health card and house key. My family made me feel like shit about the key and demanded I got it back that day. Anxious, hungover little me went overboard with trying to contact and get a response out of my friend, but I was getting nothing which made me more anxious because now I'm thinking, 'what in the fuck did I do last night?'. 7+ hours later she said she had just got her phone and she was in the hospital. Right away, I apologized and made sure she wasn't alone. The texting stopped soon after that. The next day comes around and I'm just receiving snaps of her being extra. I checked up on her and so on. Now it's thanks giving day and since her boyfriends parents live up by me, she was able to drop off some of my things. CoolCool. She asked me for money because I guess I broke her boyfriends bowl to a bong. So I sent the money that it cost to replace it and right then I realized she wasn't happy with me. Soo I'm like whatever... nothing serious happened. But the day after I get this long text about how I didn't say sorry for anything and I made her feel like shit when she was in the hospital, and that she basically needed time from me, but she's not mad at me or anything. I questioned her and she very rudely said 'I said I need time, why are you still talking to me'. So that was that but as it began to get colder out, I messaged her about getting my favorite scarf back in a kind way (even thought I was heated inside). She's Like 'ya I have it, but I don't think I can drop it off today because I'm busy'. Busy. A phrase I would hear from her a lot when she didn't want to do something. I let it slide and I waited through the weekend and days after. I message her again, asking if she could drop it of today after work. and she went on about how tired she is. Sick of waiting around for her I decided to pick it up myself. We traded scarfs the year before but I didn't bring hers when I went to pick mine, as a last minute petty decision. I felt because she kept me waiting, made me ask more than once and put me through hoops of getting that same scarf back months prior. I'd make her come to my place to pick it up. I gave her a dose of her own medication and she did not like that. She continued to scream that I was a bitch and to never speak to her again. I didn't turn back, just kept going. 4 hours later I get a text from her saying that 'I can keep her scarf as symbol of our friendship (or something) because I clearly didn't want to be friends anymore'. I ignored the shit out of that dramatic ass text for days. But it was on the top of my mind everyday so I finally answered. Basically saying that this is not what I wanted but I cant convince her to see how much I care and that I can't change her way of thinking, so I wasn't going to chase her and that I was ready to let people in my life that value me. She sends me another paragraph, first stating she didn't read a word I said and went on discrediting me and saying that I've been a bad friend a lot throughout our friendship, saying she doesn't want to be surrounded by shitty people anymore and ending with 'I no longer want to continue this friendship'. I responded I'm not a shitty person but that was a shitty response. Blocked her number and died inside. She obviously went back and read what I sent to her after that because she's been trying to reach out to me since. BuT I couldn't let her back in right away. Everything was so uncalled her. We're starting to message again but I don't know if I want to let her back in. I feel like things can't be the same. Not if she can say I've been a bad friend to her... wheres the trust? whats the truth? This all makes me really sad and I just don't know if it would be worth it to hang out with her again. She's a good person but I know I'm going to get hurt. But I'm so alone without her. I don't know what to do..", "subreddit": "lonely"}

I\u2019m unrelatable. I\u2019m weird and awkward. I\u2019m slow. I got all this from multiple strangers, and some from family and friends. I don\u2019t know how to fix this. I just need to give up, there\u2019s no hope. I wish I didn\u2019t have to feel like this. I wish I could actually be liked. Loved even. Not family love, most of the time that\u2019s forced. I wish I was a person who someone wants to spend time with. I wish I could stop making plans that fall through and actually be invited. That really wouldn\u2019t change much, would it?

What he feels, I don\u2019t know, so I can\u2019t say it\u2019s worse than mine. It just made me think. It\u2019s a joke amoungst my friends, that even sex traffickers wouldnt be able to sell me.

I was always intrigued by the idea of experiencing a foreign culture firsthand and I wanted to perfect my English skills(I\u2019m not a native speaker), as it was, and still is, my favourite subject in school. When I arrived here, I quickly found a group of friends which I joined as early as the first week. I was stuck in the background a lot of course since they didn\u2019t know me that well, so it was a lonely existence, but I slowly started using more space. Around the month mark, someone I travelled here with joined the group too, and went through the same as me, but became close friends with them way faster than me. I stayed in my background role because I felt forced into doing it since they focused their energy on her rather than me, taking the space I used and giving it to her. I decided to try and force myself into the foreground so I didn\u2019t feel forgotten about, but that backfired hard and most of the people in the group started disliking me, with certain people actually hating me. I was told this by the other new girl, which made me stop. I started taking the backseat, but still maintaining activity, which was exactly what the new girl advised me to, and it seemed to work. I started enjoying myself more and people started liking me more. At least I hope. However, today something happened which has made me doubt that. Me and the new girl have become quite good friends since we came here and we go out together at least 2 times a week. We talk about everything, and although I feel jealous of her position in the group, I really like her, and she has become one of my closest friends ever. Anyway, today we were hanging out and talking about memes, and she said to me: \u201cI\u2019m in the group chat, and they send a lot of dank memes there\u201d. I\u2019m going off assumptions, but I am 99% certain she was talking about our friend group\u2019s group chat, which I am not a part of, and i thought she wasn\u2019t either. It\u2019s gotten me quite upset as I thought I had fixed my image and finally become part of the group. Apparently I haven\u2019t. So far throughout the exchange I\u2019ve struggled with low confidence and self doubt because of everything I\u2019ve written, but today was the nail in the coffin, so to say. The fact that my friend, who came later, was received so well and I, who came earlier, was not makes me feel very upset. I know that I had a phase where I was obnoxious, for lack of a better word(because that\u2019s what me putting myself out there resulted in), but I thought I had mended that. I\u2019m sorry for the long post, but I have nowhere else to rant about this (gotta keep up appearances for the peeps back home, and I don\u2019t want my friend here to feel like I dislike her).", "subreddit": "lonely"}

I have never been able to share, how much beauty and wonderful things I see all around and feel because of him. I\u2019ve never been able to share anything with anyone...no one knows I exist.\n\nAnd even if someone did...I have...so many times where I feel like no one could ever love me. I feel like a bother, an annoyance, a burden and tiring source of strife and routine suffering for those that have to take care of me, I feel worse than nothing. There\u2019s nothing good about me, what on earth could anyone like about me, let alone love, especially when they see me in the hospital with wires and blood everywhere, crying in pain, crying cause I\u2019m terrified of all the people staring at me, like I\u2019m a test rat, that they\u2019d prefer die so they could be done with me. I panic a lot at hospitals...my anxiety and fear mixed with all the pain and all the people...it doesn\u2019t go well together.\n\nBut despite ALL of that...I\u2019m still such a terrible HOPELESS romantic...when I see couples being all sweet together, I\u2019m not bitter, no I could never be bitter, I\u2019m so happy for them (and grossed out when they freaking make out lol), cause...I know how happy I would be if I had someone. Geez I stay in my head most of my days...see I dream of taking midnight walks together, singing and dancing together as we watch the stars and talk about constellations. Of the warmth and snuggles and cuddles and petting and patting that leads to wrestling and pillow fights and running around chasing each other, smack talking each other and then just throw DOWN lol, just being two dorky kids just purely happy and in love with each other. I dream of sitting under trees and reading to each other, being dramatic and playing out the scenes in the books. Of baking and cooking together...trying all kinds of recipes and new things, staring into each other\u2019s eyes after having touched each other\u2019s hearts, and wondering how on earth could God have blessed me, me! Someone who fails and messes up so much...who struggles so much, how could he have blessed me with a person so full of love...my best friend...someone who can watch the birds with me, play music and games with me. Indulge in the noble pursuit of MEMES, good gosh nobody knows any of the memes I quote! I just...I don\u2019t even know if I\u2019m making sense. I just...feel alone.

If you have sex without any sorts of prevention for pregnancies, you gonna have to face some consequences. So what I\u2019m trying to say is that, even if you are aware, there is no guarantee that you are not gonna engage in dangerous sexual activities when you have a partner. And guess what? If you have a partner and make her or yourself pregnant, you either gotta have to go to the State or countries where abortion is permitted. Otherwise you gotta have to make a decision of becoming a parent. And if you make kids this way, the chance of you that you gonna love your kids is relatively lower. And if you don\u2019t love your kids or even start to abuse them, they will have higher chance of becoming a criminal, doing drugs and so on. But if you don\u2019t have a partner, the chance of you making kids is zero. So you are risk free! You have more time to do more important activities! So stay outta trouble brothers and sisters.

Like waiting for his calls and seeing him at school or even just having him park next to me at school is so exciting and like the only thing I look forward to or even get out of bed for, but I know that nothing is going to happen because 1) he just broke up with his girlfriend that he really really loved (and is still super close with her and I suspect he still has a lot of feelings for her) 2) he is most definitely not attracted to,,, im not his type cause ik his type. The fact that I know Ill never have him is killing me and it makes me so sad and angry that I just lay in bed with frustration even though I know having him won\u2019t just fix my depression. But the hardest thing is that he openly shows affection sometimes like hugging me or playing with my hair or talking for three hours in the phone at night, but other times he is completely unresponsive to even my texts. And he jokes around with platonic sex with me and things which makes me even more depressed knowing that nothing will be genuine and even if it im just a rebound from his girlfriend and it pisses me off and makes me so sad. And ik i should distance myself from him to make it better, but I just give in whenever he gives me any attention plus he\u2019s the only one who i can talk to about my depression and I don\u2019t want to loose that.

{"post_id": "ee986d", "created_utc": 1577043641, "title": "Am I Wrong?", "author": "emotionalrec", "self_text": "My parents have been punishing me for about a month now. I'm not allowed to go outside at all, my phone is taken cutting me from all outside interactions with my friends (I never connected my iCloud to my Mac which I'm using right now) so I'm left to just sit in this empty house alone while they go out everyday doing I don't know what. It's all because of my grades and the fact that I was smoking weed. I understand that is more than enough reason to punish a child but this has been going on for a month. What hurts more is that I had so many things planned for my two week break which started two days ago. I thought they would have some sympathy since it's Christmas time but no. \n\nThe day break started my mother drove me home from school and I had asked if my friend could come over the house (they previously had let her before) and my mom coldly replied no and started cursing at me. I started to cry, not because she said no but because I had just seen a class full of kids excited for their holiday break, to hang out with their friends, go iceskating, open gifts. But for me that no indicated that this long ass break will be just like how Thanksgiving break was. Alone. \n\nThanksgiving break was the most terrible point in time for me. I had fallen into such a deep depression. I don't think its okay for anyone to be stuck in a house for days on end with no human interaction. I slept my days away not doing anything because there was nothing to do. I felt like I was in prison. \n\nEvery time I try to explain to my parents why I smoke weed they tell me it's a excuse. I have struggled with depression and anxiety ever since middle school. I have told my parents this ever since middle school. However I live in a ethnic household, and especially hispanic people don't believe in mental illness. They think my generation is just crazy. But the crazy part is mental illness runs in my family. My uncle is in a mental hospital in Florida due to schizophrenia, and most of my family are ex crack-addicts due to mental illness.  The only time Ive ever seen my parents look the tiniest bit empathetic for me was years ago when I used to cut myself and my mother found a bloody razor. But that was years ago. Now when I cry they look at me with disgust. When I tell them I want to die they turn and walk away. It feels as though they will only believe these feelings of mine are true when I kill myself.\n\nAnyway back to the first day of break, I was crying. I went to my room and tried to sleep.  I sleep whenever I feel sad so I don't have to think because when I think I start to cry endlessly without being able to stop. My dad busted my door open and told me to take my contacts off. He obviously knew I was going through something at the moment and now was not the time to argue, or so I thought. I had a really bad day overall but I said okay, expecting him to leave. However he stayed at my door staring at me. So I asked what? He told me you don't take them off when you want you take them off now. I don't understand them. Why does it matter when I take them off?  I feel as though they have a superiority complex, if anything I do isn't done exactly when they say so, exactly on their timing, even something as pointless and stupid as this, that doesn't affect them in anyway, they will flip out. And that's exactly what happened. Anyways, I told him I will take them off and he closed the door and left. I went back to closing my eyes and trying to calm myself. I had a blanket over my head so when my dad had snuck into my room again and grabbed me I didn't realize what was happening. Mind you, I'm a petite 5 foot highschool female, and my father is a 5'11 muscular man who goes to the gym. He grabbed me out of my bed, slammed me onto the floor and pulled me by my hair. He choked me and hit me. I have a long red scratch from my jaw to my neck which I have no idea how I am going to hide it from the rest of my family on Christmas. \n\nMy mom is  familiar with my dad's outbursts. When I was younger and he used to relapse a lot more (he's a ex addict even though he probably hasn't been clean for over 2 months max). He used to do that to her instead of me. My mom came rushing in telling him to stop. He kept yelling and screaming like a animal for her to get the fuck out over and over and that he was gonna hit me making fists. He told her that it was her fault I was scared of him. After about 10 minutes of this  he left. My mom then came in my room screaming at me. Telling me it's all my fault, that I must love this stuff. I was crying asking her does she really think I deserve this? I couldn't breathe, I was so scared. I couldn't get anything out. I just kept begging for her to get me out of the house I was begging, telling her I was scared, saying please please just let me live somewhere else. They had let my brother live with my aunt for a while when he was younger so I thought they could do the same for me. While I was sobbing and begging she was just telling me to shut the fuck up and that it's not okay when he does it to her but it's okay for me. She said I'm just spoiled and parents beat their kids. This isn't the first time this has happened with my Dad. What hurt the most was her shutting the door on me when I said \"Im scared Mom please\". Leaving me alone. \n\nMy mom hits me a lot and I put up with it because it's my mom and she's a woman. I understand for ethnic households that's normal. But for a Father to touch their daughter like that? I have bruises and scars, I don't feel like this is okay. When I told her that he choked me and showed her my neck she said he'd only scratched me and brushed it off.\n\nI feel so scared and alone in this house, I have no way out and no way to contact anyone I know. I'm forced to sit alone in this house.\n\nI have no say in anything that goes on in my life, I can't even decide when I want to take off my contacts! They believe every decision I have should be made by them, but then complain about me being irresponsible. How am I supposed to know how to be independent when I never had the chance to? I used to have a job, and go everyday on time and just do my work. But my mother made me give all my paychecks to her, I've never even touch a cent of the money I've ever made in my life. She made me quit my job as a part of my punishment. \n\nIm young, still in highschool so it's expected that sometimes I may act irrationally because I' a teenager right? Any normal parent would have a understanding of teenage angst and hormones right? Well not my parents. My whole life since I was young I'd have to make sure that I control how I express my emotions because my parents can't handle that, they will lash out instead of being adults and being the bigger person. I have never ever been able to just be a kid and have those moments of irrational outbursts, because I am too busy being the bigger person for them when they threaten me constantly for every little thing I do. I had to mature quickly and just tell them to calm down when their anger issues flare up. Shouldn't it be opposite, shouldn't they be the ones trying to calm me? It doesn't feel right.\n\nI don't know what to do, I don't want to spend two weeks alone in this house, I feel like this might be my breaking point if I do.", "subreddit": "lonely"}

I really liked his videos, they're very funny to me (don't judge me, I'm still young enough to play the \"I'm just a kid\" card) and I got extremely sad after I was done watching them. Why? Because I know that I'll never have any of those experiences like laughing your ass off with your friends to the point where you cry. Thing is, I did have friends in high school, well, at least I considered them to be. But after about 9 grade I knew that they weren't my real friends, they just used me. But at least I had the illusion of having friends, which still felt pretty good. \n\nWhat I'm leading up to is I got very depressed because I know what it feels like to have friends, whereas I never even had a female friend let alone a gf and I kinda don't even feel that sad about it tbh. Don't get me wrong, I do want to experience all the things people in relationships experience, it's just that since I never had any of it, I don't really know what I'm missing out on. I guess my mind perceives having a gf as the same kind of a fantasy as getting a letter from Hogwarts or something like that. Do I feel sad because I'll never be in Hogwarts? Well, kinda, but it's just a fantasy, so what's the point of getting upset over it?\n\nI think I'm actually very lucky to be able to say this because I know a lot of you people can get REALLY depressed over not having a partner to the point where you're suicidal whereas I just don't really care. Maybe I will once I get older but for now I don't feel that bad about it. What really gets to me is lack of friends, having no one to discuss a movie with, or even go to the damn movie with in the first place or share a meme with, you get the point.", "subreddit": "ForeverAlone"}

I noticed there was this other American girl, kind of cute, so I chatted her up between when the guide was leading us from place to place. We seemed to get along pretty well, I'm not the best at reading people but she initiated conversation a couple times so I could tell she didn't completely want to ignore me, a welcome surprise. It took some massive psyching up on my end (and I'm still surprised I did it) but near the end I asked her what she was doing for dinner, and if she wanted to go somewhere. She said yes! It felt awesome getting that kind of validation though I had to keep my excitement a secret so she didn't get freaked out.\n\nWe went to a nice restaurant and talked over some seafood, basically about each others lives back at home and plans for rest of our trips. It honestly felt like a date. We kept things pretty casual, she mentioned a boyfriend midway through so I didn't try to flirt (should I have anyway?) and when asked about what her plans were later (same way I initiated asking her to dinner) she said she'd probably go to her hotel since she was tired so I didn't push going somewhere else for drinks or anything. We parted ways after dinner to our respective accommodations, I didn't even get her last name. It was a nice, throwaway encounter with someone random, spontaneous and exciting.\n\nIs this what normal (socially successful) extroverted people just do? Since they can meet people so easily it doesn't matter if they sit down for dinner with someone with the full intention of never seeing them again. It's hard to let this go for me. I do regret not getting her social details or something, it's like putting work into something and having it just vanish, even though I know full well even if we swapped info we'd probably never talk except maybe for a few more days on our trips. I suppose in hindsight I could've just said something lowkey like \"hey, what's your insta, if you're ever in chicago you can look me up\" so it doesn't sound like a commitment. It sounds like I did pretty good otherwise, and I definitely feel pretty good about being a more likeable person, if I can just convince a stranger to go spend some time alone with me.

I stay in one spot for about two weeks and I travel between the US and Canada.

For me it started really early, dysfunctional household, Jekyl and Hyde alcoholic stepdad, no friends and being bullied at school,  When I finally was old enough to discover drugs and booze they not only provided escape and made me feel better they provided a false bit of social status as well, finally giving me some sort common ground to relate with people and even got me laid a couple times.  Of course those friendships were deep as a puddle, and now that I'm clean I'm back to being a ghost.  \n\nSo what are your thoughts?  Am I just trying to blame my addiction on being FA to feel better?

I have been getting depressive/suicidal thoughts because of events happening more recently. I never have felt a part of a group or activity, or even had my own consistent thing. Ever since I was younger, i was never a part of anything for more than a year or so and my family could never keep up with the same thing. They would let me try out different things but never would continue them. I used to be a part of Girl Scouts for a few years and that stopped, I tried different sports like soccer and ice hockey and that stopped, we used to go ice skating with our family friends every Sunday and that stopped. Some of my favorite things stopped and I never got to form hobbies other than playing Pok\u00e9mon on my Gameboy and DS for most of my childhood but even that stopped.  My family has been described as extremely scattered by people I know which is kind of hurtful because I never really thought of them that way but it\u2019s true. We never know what to do and when we do something, if that fails, we move onto the next thing almost instantly. None of our relatives talk to us. I have a few aunts and uncles on each side with older cousins and I never see them anymore or throughout most of my adolescence childhood. I never felt like I had my own \u201cclan\u201d. Even my own family does separate things in the same household so we never really connect as a whole and have things we like to do together other than shopping and go out for food but we are becoming broke so they don\u2019t want to do that as often anymore which I can understand. My family friends don\u2019t talk to me that much as friends anymore which makes me really sad because I was raised with them and I will reach out to try to talk and most of the time they won\u2019t respond. Throughout high school I never had a set group of friends. Each year I would have a different pair of people and they would stop talking to me the next year. I thought I made some good friends my senior year but even then most of them except for one stopped talking to me and even blocked me without explanation. I\u2019ve been to college for 2 years and last year I thought I finally made some friends that would stick for longer than a year. This year my friends one by one stopped inviting me out, stopped replying to texts, and stopped talking to me in person even if I saw them. My roommate doesn\u2019t even talk to me anymore and I let her move in with me because I thought we were friends. She ended up taking all my friends and now they all hang out together leaving me out of the picture and I am constantly alone. I have tried to talk to other people and even they stopped talking to me after a few weeks. I constantly feel alone by not having anyone to talk to or hang out with. I\u2019ve told my parents this and that I want to transfer to a different school but it\u2019s been difficult. I can\u2019t seem to find a school that has what I want to pursue. I have good grades and I am passionate about my career, I have a good opportunity for an internship that I really want to do and I hope I get it because that\u2019s the only thing I\u2019m looking forward to. My mom made me really upset today because she said maybe things don\u2019t work out for me and people don\u2019t want to talk to me because of me, how I am myself, because this loneliness seems to follow me wherever I go. This made me feel extremely alone because they don\u2019t see how hard I try to keep friends, they don\u2019t understand the situations I\u2019m put in where people can drop me like I\u2019m nothing, they don\u2019t get what it\u2019s like to be me. My mom doesn\u2019t seem to have a lot of friends either so its made me think maybe the apple doesn\u2019t stray that far from the tree. I have recently thought about taking my life because I feel so worthless and the only reason I don\u2019t is because I want to stay for my parents and I want to have my dream job and I want to be with the guy I love. I am not even sure if I will ever be able to be with him because we live on opposite sides of the country and when he talks to me, he doesn\u2019t seem that interested since the last time I saw him in person during thanksgiving time. I feel like I\u2019m never going to be important to anyone and I don\u2019t want to seem like I\u2019m begging for attention. I feel like nobody. My best friend from college who recently stopped talking to me even said that nobody is ever going to love me because I\u2019m easy. I have never let anyone\u2019s hurtful comments get to me until this. My moms comment too has made me feel extremely alone. I don\u2019t know why people decide to stop talking to me, I tend to put my problems upon people and ask them for help but that\u2019s because I don\u2019t know who else to go to. I\u2019ve been going to therapy and I haven\u2019t told her any of this yet because things haven\u2019t gotten bad up until now. I feel like a complete waste of space and I\u2019m not going to do anything to myself besides cry about it so don\u2019t worry. I don\u2019t self harm and I stopped smoking weed as often. I need advice on how to keep going even if I feel like I\u2019m falling apart. Are there any group chats that are out there where I can talk to people and make internet friends?", "subreddit": "lonely"}

DIDN'T REALISE EVEN THIS SUBREDDIT WAS A POPULARITY CONTEST WHERE THE BEST POSTS GET ACKNOWLEDGED YET THERE ARE SO MANY LEFT IGNORED.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI have only one friend, now she knows I don't expect anything from her, that I don't expect time or attention from her and most of all  that she isn't obligated to do anything for me. She knows I have no other friends and she doesn't see me as any less of a person for it. She takes time out of her day to talk to me about her day, share with me the things that makes her happy, and she messages me first which is more than I could ever wish for.\n\nYet all of this, she can cease doing and I won't be there kicking up a fuss over it. But if there is one thing I can say... which probably contradicts what I've said above... but compared to us both, she has often friends she hangs out with and invites over to her place to watch a movie or something. Since we first became friends, 3 years ago, we've never met up in person this way, despite her having friends that she would hang out with every so often.\n\nSometimes she would tell me stories of what her friends would get up to and I would be happy for them. It's good that she has people to hang out with, but it does sting a little to know that while this is happening the only time you've spent with her is online over the Internet. Sure you've made plans to hang out, but typically she is busy. She hasn't got much time to hang out, and you've got to consider time and travel as well. Yet these other friends of hers, some of them are living the same amount of distance away from her as I am. 45 minute bus ride.\n\nI know I could simply ask to hang out with her, but as someone who is always the one who is interested enough in asking if a friend would like to hang out, nobody ever makes these kinds of requests to me. Nobody ever asks me if I want to hang out anywhere, nobody ever seems interested enough in even suggesting it. And I'm fearful that is I do suggest something, it's just the thought of knowing I'm the only one who makes this effort. It makes you start worrying, is she going to turn out to be one of these people who isn't going to make the effort  too? I'm sorry, but you can't help but feel worthless when your friend never asks if you want to hang out. I don't feel it's right for it to be 100% on me...\n\nTonight as we were talking, she told me that this week she's got a friend stopping over for a week. Now I know this friend is probably closer and as a plus it's more acceptable for her friend to stop over than it would be for me. I understand this and I understand how awkward it would be to stop over hers, but even the idea of having a friend visit your house or being able to visit theirs. It seems so far out of my reality for me. I've never had a friend offer to come round and visit, and knowing her the friend who is coming round has made the arrangement themselves. Imagine having friends who actually want to come visit you, instead of you having to suggest it instead. And I'm talking about every friend I once had who decided to up and leave. None of them, even if we've known each other for years, ever suggested hanging out or coming over to visit, or even allowing me to visit them.\n\nFor me to visit THEIR home is just taboo... it isn't thought of... it isn't accepted.\n\nI don't even know where this vent is going anymore apart from in a dumpster fire. I know I sound selfish. I am ashamed of myself, first beginning my post by saying I don't expect anything, when clearly I do... it just makes me feel like I must be very unimportant or just a fleeting thought... someone that isn't fun enough to hang out with.\n\nIf this post sounds untidy, disorganised and full of typos.

The thing that makes me feel so terrible is they I will never know if he liked me or if he just wanted to be friends. Another thing that bothers me is that I\u2019m worried that he means more to me than i mean to him. He was friends with a lot of people so why would I be special to him.

I\u2019m also extremely lonely. I live 1500 miles away from my entire family (including extended family), and haven\u2019t really made close friends in my new city. I\u2019ve struggled with loneliness long before I moved to a new state, however. Lately that and depression have been the main themes of my life. One way I\u2019ve always dealt with this is over-sharing on social media. I think It\u2019s just an intense craving for connection and for someone to relate to what I\u2019m going through. In the past I\u2019ve shared about my mental health in detail, struggles I was going through at the time, and certain things that were bothering me. For some reason it\u2019s easier to word vomit all over social media than it is to ask someone close to me if I can talk to them. Maybe it\u2019s because I\u2019m not expecting a response with social media, and I\u2019m not forcing someone to listen to my problems and have something to say back to me. Instead, people can just scroll through my post and ignore it if they want. In the past, posting like this was somewhat empowering for me. I got to get emotions off my chest, and the posts were always well received. Lately however, when I get the urge to post and go through with it, I get extremely anxious and feel physically sick 10 minutes after posting. Thinking about how many people know deep things about me makes me super uneasy. I think this started when someone from work used a post about my anxiety against me. Anyway, I always end up deleting the posts.  Now that this outlet is gone, I feel like everything is building up inside me and I\u2019ve been feeling really tense, negative, and sad. It makes me feel 100x more lonely. I just don\u2019t want to be \u201cthat girl\u201d anymore. These people don\u2019t deserve to know me so intimately.

First time really asking for advice from any community.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m just lonely. I\u2019m almost 31 and have only ever been in one relationship my whole life, and it was very unconventional. We met online playing this old MMO. We quickly became good friends and after about a year of playing together every day, I finally told her I had a crush on her. We wound up meeting and hitting it off. We were both virgins at the time and one thing that was difficult for me was the fact that she never wanted sex. She kept saying she wasn\u2019t ready and, this being my only relationship, I thought it was normal and loved her enough to respect her needs. This went on for over 5 years. I brought it up several times but I never got pushy about it. She dumped me 2 years ago out of the blue. It was absolutely devastating. Having been so in love with someone and to have never gotten to have a physical connection with them after waiting all those years for one. It was a dark time for me. We wound up getting back in touch a year later. I hadn\u2019t moved on. I didn\u2019t know how to. I was so in love with this person and couldn\u2019t believe she had been so quick to just end things without any warning. Even after a year of no communication, it was easy to slip back into a friendly conversation. She wound up telling me about the guys she\u2019d met and even how she had lost her virginity just a few weeks after we broke up. I couldn\u2019t handle hearing this. It just shredded whatever was left of my heart to pieces. I went on a rant about how shitty a feeling that was, to have waited for her to be ready for all those years then to have her dump me and sleep with a guy she barely knew. I cut off all communication with her after that. I was done with this person toying with me. Done letting her wreak havoc on my self-esteem. A year later and, while I am completely over her as a person, I\u2019m not over that feeling of inadequacy and betrayal. I don\u2019t know how to trust a woman again knowing that kind of hurt could happen again. It\u2019s a shitty feeling. I\u2019ve never gotten too deep in explaining this situation to any of my close loved ones. I know they\u2019d support me, but I know it would break their hearts to know how deeply sad and lonely I am. I don\u2019t want to be a burden.\u201d\n\nThis experience just left me in a bad place. Low self-esteem and feelings of inadequacy. Plus, I\u2019ve never asked a girl out so the fear of rejection is unbelievably daunting to me. Being a virgin seems to complicate things even more. It\u2019s hard to imagine anyone my age being okay with being with someone with no experience. I don\u2019t know what I\u2019m even asking for here, just need to vent.", "subreddit": "lonely"}

I'm usually a very social person, I have a lot of friends and never felt quite lonely until the point I met someone very special. Whilst being on Vacation I met the girl of my dreams 3 days before my flight home. I never would have even approached her, because I thought that I was way out of her league. However, it was she who told me that she really liked me. We spent the last 3 days together. It was like something out of a movie. Watching sunsets, kissing whilst doing so... it was like a dream &amp; I never experienced anything quite like this before. Those 3 days went by so quickly, but are still, to this day the best 3 days of my life. Unfortunately, I live in Germany and she lives in Spain. I had 2 relationships before, but I think this was the first time I was actually really in love with someone. I confessed to her &amp; she said she loved me, too. I was really flattered but didn't know what to do. After my flight home, we tried to keep contact up, but because of the distance and the wealth-state of her and my family we weren't really able to afford a meeting + I was in the middle of my A-levels then. The contact kind of broke down, after she told me, that \"she wasn't really ready for such kind of a relationship\", but also told me that she really \"loved me\". I haven't spoken to her in over 1 year. I had 1 relationship and plenty of dates until now because I hate being alone, but somehow I start comparing everyone to her. Not any of those dates &amp; not even the relationship felt like love for me. I sometimes wasn't even able to make love, because there was that feeling inside of me telling me that this is wrong and not even the person I actually love. No one matched her and I think my body just tried to fight the loneliness or try to cope with the loss of hers. I know you are not supposed to look at what happened, but I just can't. It's also very hard to express this feeling it makes me feel lonely when I'm home alone, even tho I have plenty of friends and being socially active. I know it sounds very childish and like some 14-year-olds love story, but I'm actually 20 now and this is still something I'm trying to figure out within myself. I can not stop thinking about her even tho I know it's only gonna f'ck me up.  I think I will never be able to find anyone like her and I hate myself for letting her go so easily. \n\nI'm here to seek help from those who might have experienced similar things.

But I never let that happen, I was always conscious of her and always made sure she never felt left out of my life or pushed aside. After high school (2014), my best friend and I grew apart a little bit, due to us both having serious boyfriends. Obviously I expected this. But over the years we just grew more and more distant, and not for my lack of trying. I should mention we only live 30 mins for eachother. That's when it started to feel like she didnt really care about me anymore. My boyfriend and I broke up in 2016, and that's when I just felt so lost. I didnt have any friends, my boyfriend, or even my best friend, whom of which I never imagined our relationship would change so drastically. We still talk sometimes, but at this point she's really just more of an acquaintance with the title of best friend, because she's the only one I \"have\". I have felt so lonely ever since. My next serious relationship began in 2017. We love eachother very much and we are still currently dating. But it still doesn't tame the loneliness because I still have no friends. While he is amazing and we're super close, it still sucks to not have anyone to talk to but your boyfriend. Now, I can't even really talk to him because he just left for Marine boot camp. I have family, but they're not really the type I can talk to about anything or reveal much of my true self too. I love them so much but they can be extremely judgemental. I just feel extremely lonely and isolated right now, and quite frankly like I might go insane lol. \n\nAnyway, I dont know what my point of writing this really was. I guess I honestly just needed someone or something to vent to. And maybe people to talk to. \n\nAlso, I'm here to lend an ear to anyone else who might be feeling lonely.

{"post_id": "eeu8xx", "created_utc": 1577152055, "title": "Feel free to laugh - mess of a post", "author": "darkskiesthrowaway", "self_text": "I'm aware meeting people from the Internet is common now. That so many hook up via Tinder or befriend strangers on Reddit and other sites just to meet up in person.\n\nFor many people, they've clearly got friends who can make sure they're safe when in a strangers home or hanging out elsewhere. All they need to do is ask a friend to drop them a message to see if they're fine or even ask that friend to join them on the first meet up (coffee or something) as a safety net.\n\nNow due to people's perceptions of me, I'm easily looked at as a weak person who can easily be taken advantage of. I was never seen as a confident person with a backbone, so over time my brain got used to this perception, and so I've reduced myself to weak and frail without a backbone.\n\nI fear that if I tried to meet someone in person, I might just end up getting attacked, because that's the sort of luck I have. If I'm not being ghosted, stepped on, taken for granted, a stranger could go ahead and injure me or anything. \n\nI know that if I don't start opening myself up to people online and seeing if anyone would meet up with me, then I can't say I ever tried. \n\nI know in person I can't make friends, because of my SM, in person my voice won't work. At least online I can type as a way to speak. Online is probably my only choice to ever see if there's anyone who would consider me a friend. \n\nTruthfully, I haven't even given any dating sites a go due to fear... which probably makes me look bad. \"Oh darkskiesthrowaway says they're LONELY but they haven't even been rejected or tried to get a date on Tinder! What a prick!\"\n\nSo how do you meet a person and come back unharmed? How can a person with no safety net remain safe when meeting a person? Because someday it would be good to meet someone, someone who is perhaps genuine, someone who has similar outlandish interests as I do. \n\nIt's easier to find people who you can relate to online. \n\nI know. It is beyond pathetic. The fact I am asking this, it's enough to pity me. So please, don't hold back the laughter or the judgement, honestly go ahead.\n\nIt isn't just this though. I'm not even sure how flirting works. Whenever I get feelings for a person, I feel there has to be a perfect time. A perfect moment. I keep fearing that if I let anyone know that I had feelings for them, they would be disgusted and embarrassed. That if I tried opening my heart to someone, if I tried to playfully flirt or just confess my feelings, I would be seen as a disturbing perverse creature and potentially make them thing little of me.\n\nNo... don't worry, if anyone did reject me I wouldn't hate them or belittle them for it. I would allow them space to reflect on it. I wouldn't even mind remaining friends, if they're not too weirded out. If not, that's perfectly fine.\n\nI have had crushes on people in the past, but never asked them out. Another great reason to look down on me, because there are many on here who have tried to get with their crush but got rejected whereas I haven't.\n\nI would like to learn, people have got to learn how to be open about their feelings eventually. \n\nI just want to know if it's okay to open my heart to others or if I'm just wrong for it...\n\nAgain. Apologies for posting here for perhaps the 2nd time this night. I'm sorry for hogging space, I'm only just starting to feel slightly more comfortable posting here, as so far it feels like the only place I won't be judged...", "subreddit": "lonely"}

I still feel like a kid in most ways.\n\nAnd finally it\u2019s just a very isolating feeling, I have lost touch with basically all of my friends except her, but now it somehow feels like I\u2019ve lost her too, not be because she has a partner (she had a boyfriend in high school) but because she\u2019s grown up. Which is not a bad thing for her at all, but for me it feels like that since we\u2019re at two completely different stages in our lives I\u2019ve lost my only real friend. Which is ridiculous because we haven\u2019t seen in each other in person for a few years but the mixture of romantic jealousy and temporal shock is just making me feel super isolated. I\u2019m not really in the position to make new friends where I am at right now and I have been having family issues so I feel super lonely and depressed. I barely talk to her but I miss my friend more than ever.", "subreddit": "lonely"}

I broke up with my girlfriend half year ago and it's the past now, but loneliness doesn't go away, or I am somehow lost. I have my family and I am respecting them, but there's something more. There is something on my heart but I don't know what. There's a hole that need to be filled.\n\nI have a job, money, hobbies (gym, guitar, frisbeegolf. Thinking to start some martial artists), own apartment, friends. I am probably going to study again at next spring. I have some goals. I could have more friends. I don't have many friends and at this point it is not easy to get them.\n\nI am introvert, but very very human-centric. I like to chat with people, but I am really bad at small talking. Conversations are not easy to begin unless I am doing it on internet. Or being drunk. But alcohol is not really a part of my life anymore.\n\nI felt so long time that I will never get a crush again, because I don't want to hurt myself again. I have some bad dating experience in the past. Then I meet this girl on internet. She's basicly everything I want, so many same thoughts and values of life, music taste, etc.. And she's beautiful. We were in same school 14 years ago, it's crazy. I am 28 year old now btw. We met once and I am having a little crush. Just a little, like taking a step back now. Date didn't go that well because I was so nervous, she felt it. But she said she wanna see me again, if I agree too. But she's being busy now (she has 7 year old kid and 3-shift work, etc..). Meanwhile we can keep chatting. Well, haven't heard from her for 2, almost 3 days now. Feel like shes ghosting. This situation is making things worse right now so wanted to share it.\n\nAnyway, after 28 years I thought that I am satisfied with myself, but no. But I am not exactly sure where I am lost. I want to find inner peace and **be happy alone**. First of all I need something new, but will it fix things?

And finally tonight, I sat down and thought deeply about what I feel towards everything (life, college, a love interest who brutally rejected me, close friends who betrayed me, future prospects etc). I wrote down my thoughts as much as I wanted to, and then read them and started writing down what was possible and what could be the most rational thing to do (mind you, the most rational thing is NOT the same as the optimistic thing, so avoiding self delusion is necessary). And after all that, I don't know why but I feel like I am somewhat in control of my situation. True, I will be lonely for the foreseeable part of my life, but there's so much more I can do and so many dreams to achieve.

Just wanted to get my feelings out somewhere.\n\nI've spent a couple of days with my family, as I am home for the holidays. I have been trying to shove the Christmas spirit down my throat. I've been baking for the past week, cleaning, reading, writing, watching Christmas movies, putting Christmas music on as much as I can. Healthy distractions. I have so much to be blessed about, so much to be grateful about. I graduated debt-free from undergrad in May, I start medical school in July, my parents just moved into a beautiful home, I survived my first real adult job during my gap year, and my extended family is healthy and well. I am able-bodied, financially stable, have parents who love me, and plenty of friends to spend the holidays with. I had a holiday gathering just the other day filled with laughter and hot chocolate with some of my close friends.

I just finished a Christmas Eve dinner with my family tonight.\n\nBut I feel so incredibly empty. Fighting chronic depression for 7 years now with so much therapy, feeling alone during the holidays seems almost inevitable.

{"post_id": "efap4d", "created_utc": 1577240625, "title": "How to make new friends?", "author": "Existing-Career", "self_text": "Hi, so I\u2019m 20 and a 3rd year student in university. I realized that I don\u2019t have many friends. I had a boyfriend who I dated for 3 years since our senior year of high school but we broke up in our second year of university. During high school, my boyfriend at the time and I had many mutual friends so that\u2019s how we knew each other and started dating. 3 years later, we broke up because I cheated... which I know was totally my fault. This was in October 2018 when we broke up. I started seeing a new guy in November 2018 and we started dating in January 2019. Throughout the few months and while I was seeing the new guys, things were falling apart with my friends as the story got out about how I cheated on him and almost all my friends from high school took his side. They were also friends with him too. It was weird because I messaged those friends form high school and they would never reply to me or left me on read and never invited me out to anything after. Our friend group that me and my boyfriend at the time (now ex) shared would use to all hang out together. We would do secret Santa, throw parties, go out to eat, celebrate birthdays, go bowling and etc. I didn\u2019t really feel so lonely in the beginning and middle of 2019, but my new boyfriend I had broke up with me in September 2019. So ever since then I\u2019ve been so lonely. I only have one friend I would consider close and she\u2019s the only one that I hang out with. I have made friends from school but the only problem is that they\u2019re just \u201cschool\u201d friends and not the type you hang out with outside of school. I\u2019ve tried really hard to make friends this semester but I felt like my personality did not really match other, but I did click with some people. During this Christmas break I texted 3 people and made plans with them but some of them ended up not following through or had something that came up. My close friend I have is the only one that I\u2019ve hung out with so far during Christmas break... \n\nI feel like it\u2019s easy for me to make friends. I\u2019m a nice person and I am someone that listens to you when you talk. I\u2019m not ugly, I get many compliments from people about my looks. I dont mean to sound cocky or anything but people have told me things like I\u2019m \u201cabsolutely gorgeous\u201d, had TONs of men hit on me at the club and at raves and guys have looked back at me twice when walking by. So I don\u2019t think it has anything to do with my looks. But something that I have struggled with throughout my life is confidence. I use to be a very shy person. By very shy I mean in kindergarten other classmates would come up to me and say hi and try to be my friend but I would just ignore them because I was to shy to say something back. I\u2019m 20 right now and I\u2019m a nursing major, so it has really helped me to push me out of conform zone to talk to random patients. I feel I\u2019m comfortable with talking to strangers, but I don\u2019t know how to get started, like I\u2019m not confident enough to go up to someone randomly and start talking to them. \n\n\nCould someone maybe help me out? I feel like I\u2019m introverted by nature but people tell me that I\u2019m very friendly. I enjoy going to raves and would love to have a group of friends who are girls to plan trips to Vegas with and go out on the weekends :( \n\nI was thinking of joining a sorority in my first year of uni, but I realized it was too much commitment and I didn\u2019t have the time with schedule in school.", "subreddit": "lonely"}

Up until I found this place, I was convinced that my struggle was a singular one and that nobody else could relate because even though I've known people in high school who also struggled with making platonic and romantic connections with other people, they eventually found a way to escape while I've stood frozen in place.\n\nAt the same time, I wish this sub didn't exist.  I wish it didn't exist because I wish this struggle wasn't real and that we were all normal people with normal lives and didn't know the burden and shame that comes with being FA.  But since that burden is ours to bear, I am glad a place like this exists for people such as ourselves to share experiences, lament our suffering, seek comfort in our rejections and failures, and even celebrate achievements, whether it is success stories, or at least achieving a measure of success in our lives not necessarily related to being FA.  People may call it a negative echochamber, but I prefer the authentic experience of being true to our limitation than placating one another with bad advice and phony platitudes.\n\nThis place isn't perfect of course.  There are plenty of normie freaks that seek to denegrate, belittle, condemn, and shame us for responding to issues they've never had to deal with and probably would be completely unable to handle in our situation.  There are posers who post fake success stories and crappy advice columns for the same reasons too.  And there is an undercurrent of self-hatred that I wish didn't exist here, especially since most of the people I've seen here are FA due to circumstances beyond their control and I would be hard-pressed to understand why they should be held as responsible for their situation.\n\nWith the loss of my own sex drive, I've noticed that being FA is a lot less of a struggle than it used to be and have recently questioned whether or not I should even post here since, to me, being FA doesn't just mean dealing with a lack of relationships/friendships due to a struggle to connect with other people on either of those levels due to issues we can't control, but also suffering as a result of that struggle.  And I am not sure I qualify under that last criteria.  Still, I do the best I can to provide quality content and to offer good advice when I can.  I hope that my contributions to this place have made a positive difference for people here.\n\nI'm not really sure why else I am posting this except as kind of me rambling, but to close this off, my one Christmas wish is that we have fewer people on this sub a year from now because hopefully by then, more people would have found a way to break out of this situation.  Until then, here's to hoping 2020 treats us all a bit better!\n\n- F_A", "subreddit": "ForeverAlone"}

Hopefully I\u2019m capable of conveying all of that lol. \n\nSo today was an incredibly hard day for me. I\u2019m still getting over a rather heavy break up scenario from months ago, as well as this being the first year I haven\u2019t had my typical friend group in my life. I could get into the details of all of this but I don\u2019t want to lol, so I\u2019ll try to summarize as best as possible. \n\nThe last week or two have really been difficult regarding loneliness for me, but today one of my friends accidentally spiked that by saying that my ex, Alicen, had some shit happen. Upon asking around, I found out her car was totaled in a crash, and that friend later added that she had posted about getting gifts from Danny and Ben (just naming them to keep track).\n\nBoth of these details really yanked at my heart. The crash because I still deeply care about her regardless of anything she did to me, and the other being that the gifts bring back many old memories I have with Danny and Ben, being that they are my ex friends. Essentially what happened between us was I was a good friend to Alicen after her and Danny broke up (it\u2019s a really messy story but take my word I didn\u2019t do any wrong, I basically just talked to her after her and Danny broke up), which then prompted Danny to kick me out of his life unless I stated wrongdoing. Ben is just a fuck who does exactly what Danny does. \n\nLast Christmas the four of us exchanged gifts together and I bought them all copies of Minecraft so we could all play. Roughly two months later is when the friend shit all went down. \n\nOn top of these heartaches being brought to surface, my family also was stressing me out quite a bit making it hard for me to properly think through my emotions. And then we went into a game stop. \n\nMe and Danny had been friends since kindergarten, and we would often play video games together. Walking into that GameStop after all of that was nearly impossible, yet my sister really wanted to get a switch. I almost broke down crying thinking back to all the times me and Danny had gone into a GameStop to buy cheap co-op or multiplayer games. \n\nToday was incredibly tough. I feel like I have nobody to really go to to talk about any of this. I feel that I\u2019d give anything to have everything back, even though I know it\u2019d literally drive me to suicide to do that. I miss feeling cared about.\n\nI realize that last paragraph is really dark and scary, but I don\u2019t think I\u2019m alone on this problem. I think there\u2019s probably a lot of people that are like me in this regard, fighting their own battles this holiday season. My hope is that if you read all of this and think you can relate somehow, that you realize you\u2019re not alone either. If you\u2019re feeling comfortable, then maybe comment your own experiences.\n\nI really don\u2019t know how useful this will be to anyone, but at the least, writing a post on reddit has been my go to way to figure out some emotional distress. Message me with absolutely anything you might want to talk about, I love replying to people. And happy holidays to everyone out there who thinks that\u2019s an oxymoron.

I have no friends, no family, no girlfriend or wife. I am truly alone and by myself. I was never close to my family. As I simply never developed a connection to them. We were never active with extended family and we always did our own things in the house. Although I have 2 older brothers and my parents, I havent talked to them in years. When I did talk to them it was as short as possible so I could retreat back into my hole. My oldest brother molested me when I was six (never told anyone) and is a idiot who could never stay out of legal trouble while being the greatest human on earth, dont believe me, just ask him. He will tell you all about it. My middle brother was nice but I never spoke to him much. My Mother was a religious nut who always tried to force her religious beliefs on me (I am a anti-theist atheist) and we never saw eye to eye. She threw insults and smart ass remarks every moment she could and later disowned me and would call me the child of the devil. She was not a wife to my father and never did anything but suck the life out of everything she could lay her hands on. My Father was the best father anyone could ask for and gave everything he could to everyone. While getting everything sucked out of him from my mother. I never truely deserved my father and I know I must be a disappointment. Although I exceded academically I was bullied throughout elementary, middle, and highschool. It was hard to get friends and any friend I did make was short lived. As they grew and changed while I stayed the same, useless mass while they moved on and grew apart. I could never keep a friend for long. I tried so hard. I gave them space, I always said that we can do whatever they want and I was, often, more then willing to pay and was conscious of my \"needy-nesss\" level. When they asked if it was ok they do something else I always said yes and tried to be as easy going as possible. In my schooling years I was very suicidal and was admitted into the mental hospital multiple times being diagnosed with Severe Depression Disorder, a sleeping disorder, Serve social axiety, and Obsessive Compulsive Disorder (centered on repetitve thoughts) as far as girls and intimate relationships go I have never had one. I have had a few times when I talked regularly with girls and became close friends (for me anyways). I am a average looking smuch and I never approached them with the idea of intimacy. But there was always a bit of hope. Each of them asked me if it was ok if they see their, now, boyfriends and I always said yes and that as long as they are happy then thats all that matters. They always asked why I have never asked a girl out. The truth is, if I love someone then I should want whats best for them, and deep down I know that isn't me. They always said I was wrong and that I'm a sweet guy that anyone would be happy to be with. But I think it was just to make me feel better. I have only ever kissed and cuddled with  one girl. To my surprise she was the one who ignitiated it and thanked me for the night (we slept holding each other the entire night falling asleep below the stars). She is now dating someone else that she was interested in at the time. Saying that she isn't sure how she feels about me but knows she likes him and wants to try to date him. I have been giving her space the six or so months to try to not complicate her relationship with him and allow her and him more time. As I understand and respect her choice, as long as she is happy. I find that I now have stopped contact with everyone and have no one. I don't have friends at work and I have no personal life. I often find myselfing wishing I had someone to share with. Someone to share my time, feelings, and love with. I'm not even talking about intimately. I just want a friend. Although I do dream of once again being able to hold a beautiful girl in my arms again. To feel her breathing and hearing her happy sleepy noises. To feel a kiss again. I woulf just settle fot a buddy. But I don't think that this is in my future... I think that I will forever be alone. Dreaming of friends and love. I am in a successful job and have plenty of money. But with no one to share it with I find little point to do anything but go to work and come home to my computer. I think I need to accept that I will forever be alone...I just need to get to that point.\n\nIf you read this then I am sorry for any spelling/grammatical mistakes and my bitching and moaning. Its been 30 hours since I last slept and this was made on my phone.\n\nThanks,\nHuman-Malfunction", "subreddit": "lonely"}

In fact I watched a few of them grow up and even taught them a lot of shit over the years.\n\nAs with all of our yearly gatherings everyone is having a good time, even me since I generally thrive in this environment because they basically look up to me, what with me being the oldest and all that.\nThat is until the second oldest, who is 21, brought up his relationship problems. Now after his rant I was about ready to say something along the lines of \"shit happens man, you just gotta get past this\". But before I could get that out my youngest cousin, who just turned 15 a couple days ago, also shared how much he could relate to that since it happened to him with his LAST girlfriend. And after that everyone else then chimed in with their own little anecdotes from their experiences.\nAnd then there's me, the one they all used to look up to, fake laughing and smiling along while doing my best \"I know right!?\" impression. The topic eventually moved on to something else after that, but that small section of the night lingered in me.\n\nSo now I'm back home, lying alone in the dark and wondering how I got left so far behind.

No matter how many times  it breaks, no matter how many cracks strike across it, the glass never  lets go and your reflection remains. I move with haste throwing more  bottles faster, this misery must end, and my sanity begins to slip. Is  that the answer? Lose all reason and all else will follow? I don't know  how long it's been, but now that mirror has little surface left to  reflect with as cracks scorn across it at every angle. The small pieces  still clear seem to shine brighter than before. I've come so far, but  I'm more tantalized than I've ever been. Do I have what it takes to  finish this? I pick up another bottle and take my aim..", "subreddit": "ForeverAlone"}

Lately I have been Feeling like I have no friends, no family, and no options for dating.\n\nTo begin with, lately I\u2019ve been feeling like I have no friends at all. My close friend of nearly 13 years seems to have gotten another friend group and I feel like he is leaving me in the dust and we have gotten more distant over time. I\u2019m wondering why this is. \n\nI also find that he gets angry at me when we hang out for no reason at all. I asked him if he wanted to come over to watch the ball drop on New Years as my neighbors are having a party at my complex but I dislike most of them so I\u2019m not attending. He told me he already decided to hang out with another group of friends and is leaving me out of the equation. \n\nI feel like I am slowly losing the friendship with him. I also told him I got a new job recently and he had barely anything to say about it. He also told me he cares about me a lot but all of a sudden right after saying that, he canceled our meetup for a stupid reason, then when I tried to ask him when we will meet next (I\u2019m usually the initiator) he said we could maybe hang out again. I feel like I did something to turn him off. \n\nMy other close friend, a neighbor, has also been responding less and we haven\u2019t hung out in a while, but there\u2019s nothing inherently wrong that he\u2019s done. However it seems that the friendship with him is also dying out. I\u2019ve tried visiting him at work and everytime I go there, he isn\u2019t there. He\u2019s asked me many times to visit him at his workplace but it\u2019s hard to do so all the time because I don\u2019t have a car and rarely leave the house. \n\nI have another acquaintance who is actually extremely genuine and friendly and had good potential to become a close friend, but he warned me that we may stop hanging out altogether in the new year due to his busy schedule. \n\nI have some online friends and talk to people regularly on discord and Reddit but I never meet anyone who really becomes long term friend material. My closest friend right now is online and he lives in another country, but right now his messenger is deactivated so I cannot contact him. \n\nI don\u2019t have much in the way of family who I see often, I was supposed to go see them yesterday for Christmas but my mom got really sick so we had to stay home, and now there\u2019s a chance I won\u2019t be seeing them for months. \n\nI cannot for the life of me find dates. I\u2019ve tried everything from dating apps to meeting women in person and nothing has worked. Not even a single woman, not even ones desperate for even a one night stand, have been interested. It\u2019s really, really demoralizing.\n\nThe last few weeks I have been feeling physically and mentally ill, and have been unable to sleep the grand majority of the time. I can\u2019t do my hobbies because I have no one to play chess with (everyone who I could\u2019ve met in person to play with bailed) and I can\u2019t afford my other hobby. \n\nI have thought about suicide recently, but am too scared to go through with it, and worry if I did kill myself, that it would gravely upset my\nMom who is sick with diabetes and a bad back. \n\nI am extremely depressed. I don\u2019t see any hope for things to get better at this point and feel like I\u2019m permanently stuck. I tried meetups to meet others but everyone was much older than me and truthfully they weren\u2019t all that friendly either. I also hardly ever leave the house nowadays and feel like I\u2019m going completely insane. \n\nI\u2019m trapped and lost. I don\u2019t know what to do. I\u2019ve thought about moving but then I realize I\u2019m running away from my issues even though it would lead to a fresh start.\n\nI\u2019d like some advice on what I can do. I have no motivation to do anything and have been spending most of the week confined to bed because I feel like there\u2019s no reason to keep going. Normally I\u2019d exercise but I was too unmotivated to do that also. \n\nI see a therapist but most of his advice is trite. All he tells me to do is keep trying when I\u2019ve lost count as to how many places I\u2019ve gone and how many people I\u2019ve tried befriending only to get no success at all.

The images of happy people hanging out. Friends. Lovers. Families, and I find myself without it. It seems like I\u2019m watching what could be through a window with a limited view. I\u2019m sad. I\u2019m lonely. If I wasn\u2019t I wouldn\u2019t be on this sub I suppose, but idk why. I think it\u2019s because of my lack of companionship, the companionship of another that has evaded me for many many years, but I\u2019m not sure. People I thought were my friends get together without me. People I thought liked me don\u2019t. I\u2019m sick of this shit. It seems life repeats itself. The same mistakes we make will happen again. Whether it be a war or you stepping on someone\u2019s foot. Everything cycles, and cycles continuously, and I\u2019m sick of falling into the cycle. I lay here on my bed, because I\u2019m afraid to sleep. Most of my nights have been spent tossing and turning, with lonesome nights spent after lonesome nights. When I do sleep I dream of a partner. The person is a mystery, but it\u2019s not the person that matters, no. It\u2019s the idea of the person. The idea that someone loves me the way I love them. They say someone\u2019s out there for everyone. I\u2019ve been all over the US and I haven\u2019t found that someone. I find people I think to be the one, to be lead on in some elaborate way, thus falling victim to life\u2019s vicious cycle once more. Much like the Beatles song fixing a hole, I\u2019ve been taking up many different hobbies, I\u2019ve learned the guitar, the bass, the piano, I\u2019ve been painting, and of course playing video games. I try all these things to somehow work through my emotions by conveying it in music or art, but it\u2019s fleeting. It\u2019s not enough, and I\u2019m worried it never will be. I find someone and then what? Would if it still won\u2019t fill the void that\u2019s been made in my heart. I won\u2019t know unless I try it, but how am I to try it if no one is willing to try with me? When I find someone I\u2019m interested in, things go good at first, but I feel like I\u2019m not interesting enough, or that maybe I\u2019m the only one putting in effort. And sometimes it is that way, and when it is, I realize and end things before it goes too far. However when it seems like we both are interested in the other, and things are going good, that\u2019s when things hurt the most. I\u2019m not mad at anyone, I\u2019m sure you understand just as well as I that feelings suck. How can she help it if she doesn\u2019t like me anymore? Feelings are something we cant control, and that makes it all the more frustrating. Who am I to be upset with when nobody is to blame? Myself? I\u2019m still not sure, and like everyone else in the world I\u2019m just trying to find my way. And yet the cycle continues. I have more recently met a girl that has my interest and it would seem I hers. She puts in effort, more than any girl I\u2019ve talked to in a while, and she\u2019s very cute. Like the other girls we hit it off right away, and have been talking for almost a month, but we haven\u2019t hung out, and I don\u2019t want it to die. We hang out at school, but we both know that doesn\u2019t count really. Her friends are my friends and they tell me she likes me. Again though every time I ask if she wants to hang it\u2019s a clouded answer. She says she had nothing going on, so I ask if she wants to hang and she says maybe. We couldn\u2019t link up because of Christmas and she spent time with her family, as did I, so nothing could happen. But when I ask what she\u2019s doing today or later or whatever, I get the same responses. When I see these I think oh she must not be into me, I should back off, but then she says things like \u201cdon\u2019t get any weird ideas, I want to hang out but just can\u2019t\u201d which I can understand, so I wait and ask again at a later date, to be met yet again with the same answers. If anyone knows what this means I\u2019d be greatly appreciative, if you could help me out. I\u2019m tired of the cycle. I hope this is the time I can break it. To anyone that read this whopping paragraph I thank you, and wish you a happy holidays. It may get hard sometimes. But stick to it, keep pushing. Even though it might not seem like it at times, I believe there truly is someone out there for everyone. And that means you too. Again thank you for reading", "subreddit": "lonely"}

We are a passionate people, who always want to be better, and improve themselfs in every part of our lives. We do creative work, because we love that. We love what we are doing. That's what motivates us. And here I am, exactly that kind of guy who in last almost 6 years was making a career without aware that, job and passion isn't everything that can make you really happy, even if you achieve your goals at some point, and even when you are making big progress.\n\nEveryone of us have a 3 psychological needs - a need of competence (knowlegde, skills, good job etc), a need of autonomy but also a need of connection to others. Only then we will be able to feel better, more motivated and more productive. My problem is that I have everything but the last one.\n\nI was always very creative kid. When I was 8-10 I used to sketch a lot in my sketchbook, drawing a simple comics with just a sticky figures. I loved to do that, because to be honest, I haven't anything other to do in my young life, so I had to find something by myself, in my small room which was shared with my much older brothers. The reason behind that was because I had a big problems with finding true friends. I don't want to say that I haven't any, because I had, but I wasn't felt welcome, and I lived away from my friends from early school. My parents were very protective about me, and didn't helped me to find friends. Basicly a lot of time (but not always) I was just by my own.\n\nWhen I started getting older, I had possibility to met more people. Some of them are friends to this day, but in fact, that doesn't helped me with my connections to others, and overall, with my socializing with people. I was a little bit alienated, but I wasn't scared of people at all. I loved to cooperate with my colleagues, or just talking about things that I was good in. People described my that I'm a really great team-worker who always are willing to help, or teach others, and that is in fact true. Those days were very problematic for me that affected my future life drasticly, but at this point I haven't seen an issue with that. I just felt alone, but quite good. I didn't needed anything else. I spent even more time in family home, playing games, learning things and that's how I was manage to be an artist.\n\nI always had a one big goal in my mind. I wanted to make great things that will make me happy, something that I will be proud of, something that will be connected with my hobby and passion so that will be my daily job, and It happen, really really fast. I started my first job when I was 19, and It was like a dream. Those first 2 years passed so fast, because I was so much focused on work and improvement, that I forgot about many other things. I felt like I don't need that yet, it will come soon, eventualy I told myself, but It never did.\n\nIf you do every day the same thing, time moves much faster because of the habbit to the recurrence. A small short unexepcted moments that happen in your way can make your life richer that you think, because you have memory to share with others, and you don't think that time passed so fast, because of those small moments in life.\n\nAfter 1,5 year I changed job for a better position, and also a much better paid. I moved to the new city in which I lived for 2-3 years. It was my first time to live completly alone, far away from my family. At start it was just ok, but after few months I started feeling really bad, alone, without any connections. I don't get into details too much right now, but in fact it was very complex for me. Just imagine a guy who starts new live in a place without knowing anyone, without any good social skills with feeling that I'm a weird guy. I had cool dudes in studio, and I haven't any issue with them, but I had issue with making something outside the studio where I worked. Met people that I can go out somewhere, and spend time without talking all the time about job. I felt depressed when I seen colleagues from studio on Facebook who where very \"party guys\" posting very postivie pictures with other \"cool people\" around them. I wanted something similar and that crushed me, because I felt like i lost something that I will never bring back.\n\nThose years passed very fast and I have few cool memories. I met few girls in that time which where very atracted for me, but I always failed making something more from that - maybe because of my lack of confident in that kind of relations. I managed to met couple of friends who always pushed my forward, and thanks to them I am in even better place but with similar issues that I can't still solve at all.\n\nLiving completly alone was a great experience for young guy like me, because it helped me to better understand life, what is important, whats not, how I should or shouldn't behave, but lack of experience in my young time affected my life even to this day in which I still strugle to find a way out. Sometimes I feel like I trying to learn things that guys at 16-17 used to learn already and that makes even more complicated feeling that others people in my current age may have gained that experience.\n\nThe funny thing is that I still have passion to things that I do and I,m very motivated to improve myself even more ... but also at some point work and self-improvement is my escape from reality, a \"bubble\" in which I feel good, and other people know that.\n\nNow I'm 26, never was in any long-term relationship, had issues with making new friends (not related with people in job), sometimes I'm not feeling welcome by others, and I'm very lonely thinking just about art without developed any small-talk skill that I could use to make new connections (well, I don't know what should i talk about people to make new connections).\n\nNow there is new years eve happening soon, and I will spend probably that time alone.\n\nIs there anyone who have or had similar issue and could give any suggestion how to escape from that problem?", "subreddit": "lonely"}

I hold onto a pillow and pretend I\u2019m cuddling with some made up girl, that\u2019s been nice up until recently where I\u2019ve realized just how pathetic that is. I sit cooped up in my room all day because it\u2019s easier than facing the real world. I\u2019m so lonely. Going out and trying to talk to real people is next to impossible due to social skills that I blame on being raised an only child. When I do interact with people I feel a brief fulfillment until I look deeper and think either they\u2019re faking it to make me feel better or nothings going to pan out anyways, considering if I don\u2019t make al the efforts no one really tries to talk to me. But then again I have a tendency to push away certain people, those that do try and connect. Part of it being trust issues about new people based on past experiences of being treated poorly by people, part of it having some fucked up elitist mindset that says they\u2019re not good enough for me. Dating is something I\u2019ve mentally given up on, even though I still make pointless efforts. Online apps like tinder do nothing but instill false hope, and talking to girls irl don\u2019t do much cause they either have a so already or find someone better a week-month after telling me they aren\u2019t looking for anything. I feel like I\u2019m going to be single forever even though I\u2019m in the prime of my life as people say. I\u2019m not experiencing relationships and making mistakes in them now, so I won\u2019t know how to please a woman later. I\u2019m essentially digging myself a hole that gets bigger every time I fall for someone new. Can\u2019t do any of the substances I used to like to do due to legal trouble I got into thanks to a shitty roommate last year, can\u2019t walk or do exercise due to recovering from a surgery, so it\u2019s essentially just sitting in my room surfing the internet or sleeping. I\u2019m at least trying to make more art considering I have nothing better to do but depression makes it difficult, however I\u2019m making progress.

It's long sorry.\n\nI'm a guy in my early 20s and I generally do not have many friends or interaction with much people unless I have to. Never had any relationships either, been on only 1 date ever. Ever since I was a kid I was always the shy, introverted, low self esteem guy with interests that are a bit abnormal, and as a result I find it hard to find commonn ground with people and generally just stay quiet. I have recently found out I may even be on the Autism Spectrum and after reading about it, things make perfect sense.\n\nFor years, I had this problem of getting a bit obsessed and fixated with people when they show me attention or I feel like they have a lot in common with me, especially with girls (even ones I don't find super attractive, or I may not even know what they look like at all but once I find they are a girl it drives up my curiosity even more). To the point I daydream about them and would like to get to know them and talk with them more, be their friend, or even more (with girls only though), but fear that maybe they will not like me once they know more about me so I don't even try talking.\n\nThis sucks because things get to the point where my stomach seems to tie in a knot, my face is red, and I start over analyzing everything with them like for example, when I comment on their things online, or on the rare chance they comment on my stuff, Subscribe, or follow me.\n\nA recent example is with someone from YouTube who I've been a fan of for years and they actually subscribed to me and commented on a video of mine recently and I was so weirdly happy about it like a little fanboy. They are into very similar things as me and my channel, which is not big or super well known compared to them, is similar to theirs. I recently found that they are even subscribed to a good number of channels that I am and I am so infatuated with them. I feel like a stalker. I don't even know what they look like and I found that they are a girl fairly recently so that made me more obsessed. Almost like a crush on them that I want to be their friend at least, and maybe more.\n\nI have actually been making online friends lately over the past few months which started from following and PM'ing them or them talking to me and I had similar infatuations and nervousness that I have with this YouTuber but they pretty much went away with my friends since I actually have conversations with them and feel less lonely that I forget about depression, anxiety, etc. I even briefly met one in person by accident actually and they didn't seem put off by my awkwardness lol. I do still daydream about them and wonder how it would feel hanging out with them and then I'd get nervous that what if they won't like me all that much if/when they meet me in person. These friends are guys except for one who's a girl which I was pretty infatuated with but knew she has a bf so that infatuation eased up a bit. I don't over spam them with messages if they don't respond for a long time. Now I don't feel too nervous if they don't respond, but before, it felt like the end of the world. And having different people, even if just online acquaintances, to talk to, kinda helps, even though not everyone is always responsive.\n\nSorry this was a long post but this has been making me feel a bit worse lately especially because I've been home for Christmas break.

When someone does something that makes your life a little easier remember their face and each time you see them give them a smile and wave at them.\nThese trick don't numb loneliness but they do make you cope with it a little easier. And once you accept your loneliness you'll be just fine.\nSomehow I'm having the most fun I have ever had by making jokes with strangers. Of course not everyone can do that, I think I'm quite creative when it comes to having conversations, I think outside the box. So I encourage all of you loners out there to become funnier and to learn to enjoy your own jokes no matter how stupid they might be.\nThis is probably a dumb post and not the sort of thing you'd see on my profile but I'm quite fine right now, that might change an hour later and I'll be on a bridge trying to build the courage to jump.\nHave a nice day lats, thanks for reading ^^", "subreddit": "lonely"}

I'd asked a girl out in school, mustered up a ton of courage, given I was relatively from a not so well to do family economically as her. She said she would never go out with me, it was my caste apparently, I wasn't born into a family pure enough for her. I stopped chasing girls around then, worked very very hard, eventually got a good job, paid off my families loans, paid my sister's divorce fees, and funded her marriage and the subsequent delivery of my beloved niece too. I donate a third of my savings every year to this orphanage near where I live, anonymously. \n\nIn all this I never made deep friendships. I'd never been with someone. I'd asked out a couple of colleagues over the past three years but no one's said yes. I never ask again as I feel that's disrespectful.

Years later, still a virgin, but I lie to my few friends that I've gotten laid before.\n\nFeels like slavery. The only things I've been useful for is for others. I've never really understood why.

Sorry for typos I super emotional rn and can\u2019t proofread rn\n\nSo me and this girl were raised together from birth. She would call my mom and dad \u201cauntie and uncle\u201d.  We had our baby pictures together and everything. I was there for her when she was homeless I shared everything I ever got with her. From toys to clothes to even paying for trips so she could experience them with me. My family wasn\u2019t rich but we would make it work if someone else needed anything. Her family was extremely poor and I would beg my parents to help them financially. When I was young my mom started noticing a pattern of her not wanting to hangout with me unless it benefited her in some way and my mom told me she was using me but I was super loyal cause she was my only friend many times. I was bullied as a kid and so was she so I thought we were bonded because we often experienced the same things growing up. When her boyfriend died I was on the phone with her for hours and when her dad abandoned her mom I asked my family members to helped them. So when I moved across the country at 19 I assume we would be friends even family for life. Fast forward to now me and her are both 22. Two months ago she came to visit me for a month. I asked her to visit because she said that she was miserable at home and that things weren\u2019t going well for her. I live by the beach now so I asked her if she wanted to have a long vacation. We went surfing, to an amusement park and did a small road trip. The whole time she was here she complained about people around her being fat, how no one was as good as her, she bragged to my other friends that people loved her in her hometown even though before she complained that she wasn\u2019t happy. I was generally confused but she\u2019d always been the type to brag about things and make up stories even lie sometimes. She even told me that her credit score was 1000. I didn\u2019t really get upset though because she had been like this since we were kids and I always let dumb stuff that she did go, she constantly complained about my friend\u2019s saying that they weren\u2019t good enough for her and that they weren\u2019t interesting enough and that one of my friends was fat and that therefore she didn\u2019t want to spend time with them them. She complain that the new city I move to had ugly people and that it was OK for me to live here but for her she could never live here. Again I let it go whatever I didn\u2019t care, I mean since childhood she always always always talked about other people and talked about how they weren\u2019t good as her at things and she would tell me that I was lazy and all kinds of other stuff but I was willing to let it go because since we were raised together and I thought of her as practically my sister. I put up with so much from her literally for years with money with gifts with all types of things and she never not once gave me anything in return. Not even a thank you. My mom constantly told me that I should not talk to her and that we shouldn\u2019t be friends anymore because she didn\u2019t actually care about me but I always told my mom that I was a loyal friend and as long as she wanted to be my friend I would be hers. I felt bad for her maybe because I thought she had low self-esteem maybe things weren\u2019t going well for her so I figured anytime she complained it was to vent her frustration. Recently she had also been posting weird pictures with her new rich \u201cbest friend\u201d but i didnt think anything of it. Then today I text her asking her about the specs of a computer I was trying to buy. She always said she was a genius and that she was good with computers even though my mom said she was lying I thought I\u2019d ask her anyway. so I texted \u201chey does this computer look good to you\u201d and she says it \u201clooks cool\u201d then my mom gets a text one minute later saying \u201cwe need to talk about your daughter\u201d from her. Then she proceeds to tell my mom that \u201cI am bad association\u201d and that she doesn\u2019t want to be friends with me anymore, I don\u2019t know where this even came from I literally just flew her out so that we can go surfing and spend time together. I\u2019ve never done anything illegal, I don\u2019t do drugs, i\u2019m not a prostitute, I\u2019m not even mean to people, I don\u2019t understand. We are both adults and she didn\u2019t even have the courtesy to text me and instead she texted my mother telling her she didn\u2019t want to talked to me anymore but she wants to still visit my mom and dad. My mom went off on her telling her about all the things that we had ever done for her and how she was just a user. This girl then proceeded to text my dad telling him that both me and my mother were \u201cirrational and crazy\u201d my dad didn\u2019t know what was going on so he was his usual nice self. She has a new high profile job so I guess now I\u2019m not good enough for her. I wish I could sue her for all the time, energy, effort, rent, money my family spent on her. I wish I could sue her for the food we wasted on her, for the times she was homeless, for the gas for picking her up, for the clothes and all the items I ever spent on her with my own money.  I wish I could sue her for all the places I begged my parents to pick her up and take with us so we could share the same experiences. \n\nI\u2019m not a super social person so losing a friend that I\u2019ve known since birth was a real blow to myself esteem. I feel like she sucked to life out of me and through me aside the moment I wasn\u2019t useful. She even thought my parent would take her side. My mom and dad told her off and blocked her. But I feel like the pain of the tainted happy childhood memories will be with me forever. And now looking through my childhood photos of me and her (of which there are alot) are ruined. I feel drained and alone.", "subreddit": "lonely"}

As life is not offering me any chances with me going with it's flow, I am going to have to start stepping outside my comfort zone. I think that on some level I've been concious of this for quite some time, but that I've dismissed the thought due to me not even knowing how I would go about it. \n\nWell now a chance has presented itself and I'm planning a trip abroad sometime late this winter or possibly early spring. This kind of thing is very unusual for me (who as I said, usually goes with the flow of things), so I figured that it might become a springboard for a larger quest out of my comfort zone, hoping that it will give me a better perspective on things.\n\nAnd while on the theme of doing things unusal for me, I've decided to make it a new years resolution that the comming year I will dedicate myself to keep searching for ways out of my comfort one by constantly challenging myself. The reason for me making such a decision is not only my lack of satisfaction combined with recent realizations about my fault in it, but also because over the last year I've begun opening up fully to my friends. Now that I have people that I can vent freely to in real life I feel like this might give me the strength to do something like this.\n\nWish me good luck.", "subreddit": "ForeverAlone"}

He was essentially this sub incarnate. No friends in the real world, poor social skills, never so much as had any female interest in his life, addicted to porn, depressed, the whole 9 yards. He always would mope about how he's lonely, can't get a girlfriend, is hopeless. He was unemployed, living with his parents, past high school yet no desire to go to higher ED, spent his entire day just sitting on the internet, never worked out. His porn interests were extremely depraved as I would find out (all kinds of fetishery, rape, lolicon, etc.).\n\nYet, I felt bad for him, and tried giving him advice. You know, the self improvement meme. Get a job, get into shape, stop watching porn and masturbating so much, go to school, move out of his parents house, stop spending his entire life on the internet, yada yada. All things I've done.\n\nWell, guess what happened? One day, I find out he's got a girlfriend now. How? Well, basically, he was introduced to girl by a friend of ours, and they just happened to hit it off immediately.\n\nSo let me put this into perspective:\n\nDespite having no money, no job, no prospects, living with his parents, being socially retarded, having a life of rejection and no sexual or relationship experience whatsoever, out of shape, addicted to porn and having extremely degenerate sexual interests......this girl liked him anyway.\n\nThis is not only his first girlfriend, this is the FIRST GIRL who has EVER shown any interest in him. And it WORKED OUT. I know many here imagine being on a first date, or have been on dates before, and it doesn't tend to work because of the qualities you have that have rendered you FA, or it doesn't work because you just didn't click. Hell, even normies don't always get lucky with the first date. They go out with someone and it just fizzles out then they move on to someone else. And these are people with the social skills and past experience to make it work long term.\n\nThey're still together, and have been for about a year now. I cut contact with him recently. Because with his sudden success came an immense level of ego. He would constantly brag about the loads of sex he's having now (multiple times a day even), and began to talk down to me. As though he thinks he's better than me now. So I cut him loose.\n\nBut, what do we take from this? What's the lesson here? Mind you, he never took a lick of my advice, he's still porn addicted, unemployed, no prospects, doesn't work out, etc.. He has NOTHING to offer this girl, can't even pay for their dates out of his own pocket (I'm sure his parents pay for whatever they've been doing). The only thing that's changed is instead of jerking off all day he has sex all day. He didn't even have to go out of his way to find this girl, never had to so much as make a tinder account and try swiping til he got lucky, she was INTRODUCED TO HIM by someone else. He literally just existed in his own depressed, lethargic filth until somebody pitied him enough to introduce him to someone they knew.

He soon became my best friend and then we became more in August. I stole all his firsts and we are pretty damn happy. I adore him.\n\nHe couldn't have fathomed someone like me would come along and pull him out of his comfort zone and love him so hard he could barely stand it.\n\nThere is hope.

Hey, other lonesome souls, I see you. \n\nI'm back home from seeing *The Rise of Skywalker* (in Dolby, **ooooo my goooooooodness**). Went with my dad, who did say he enjoyed it, but he fell asleep for parts of it and we don't exactly talk with ease about a lot of stuff. It was a silent ride home. There's just so much there that I enjoyed. I felt like my heart was going to explode out of my chest through so many moments; now, that excitement is all still there, but I don't have anyone to share that excitement with. \n\nIt's like this all the time with anything I discover, want to do, do actually do, etc. There's just nobody there. I don't have anyone to discuss books with, or these movies, or new adventures. For instance, I'd love to go to Galaxy's Edge someday, but I'm almost certain it will be on my own or something. I just don't click very well with people, or trust, I suppose. That inhibits me a lot from forming new relationships. Burned too many times in the past. Stutter and tumble when anyone does seem to actually want to talk or share company with me. It's just isolating. With the new year coming up and my birthday, I just don't have any plans. I'll work, maybe catch dinner with my mom and/or dad. I'm very grateful for them and the company I get to share with my parents, too. But still, you know? I don't have anyone I trust to talk to or feel comfortable enough to nerd out with over these exhilarating pieces of pop culture, and that excitement just fizzles into something along the lines of... bitterness? Sadness? Not sure. \n\nI've always been a pretty lonely kid, despite a few good (but ended) friendships there. Being in my 20s now, it just feels so isolating. I look at my calendar, and besides a few appointments, there's not much there. I don't need to be constantly, exhaustingly busy with people (I do like my time alone and space to breathe), but lunch with a good friend or two, meeting up at a bookstore, catching a movie, hell, just hanging out. I forget what that's like. \n\nSorry, just adding my little ramble. Sending y'all virtual support. Thank you very much if you took the time to read my jumbled thoughts.", "subreddit": "lonely"}

Is it just my life in general? or me? I'm not here searching for pity or anything like that I have a good life, i'm from a privileged background,  i'm at university and a good set of friends but through all of this it is always overshadowed by an unwelcoming feeling. I can get pretty bad fomo even when i'm with my friends. Most of the time i just feel like i'm traversing through my life alone. I'm not sure if i'm looking for someone to be able to relate to my story or just someone who actually notices me for me because it always feels like alone.\n\nWhen i was 9 my mother passed away from cancer and i didn't really understand the full weight of it until later years. I have no grandparents 2 i never met and 2 died a few years later after my mother. One uncle I've never met(family dispute) and my other uncle got diagnosed with cancer only recently. All my cousins are much older than me living in different areas so i rarely see them although we've never really had a close relationship primarily i think to the age gap, i'm the youngest in my family my sister next being 5 years older.My close family is only my Dad and my Sister, so you can imagine how i feel at Christmases previously being surrounded by lots of family. I don't like to think about my past about older times because i'm afraid that i cant remember anything even now i find it hard to retain information/memories of events recently.\n\nI don't have any close friends that are girls which makes me sounds wet but being surrounded by only male friends my entire life really kinda sucks. I've cried in the shower before now feeling so empty so alone and everyday i wake up with no sense of purpose in my life the things i do feel meaningless. I often think about what if my dad were to die in the next 5 years, i would have no one other than my sister who would be settled with a family at that point and quiet truthfully im not sure i would know what to do with myself i would be a boy living in a mans world. Most of the time i blend into the background, most new people i speak to cant remember me a second time and even 'friends' from school feel like they don't want/cant be asked to talk to me i just feel really unrecognisable. Even the small things I've written above no one knows. No one has ever asked me about my mum because i know they feel awkward too but on the other side I've held this is for 10 years with no one asking, it can make you feel like shit at times.  I haven't had a hug from someone in many years and it just feels like there's no one there who wants me or who likes me for me. I'm not socially awkward i can be quiet at times but i'm alright to get along with but sometimes it can feel like i'm stuck in that 'nice guy' attitude or phase but i don't think it stems from not getting girls but more from family losses.\n\nThere's a lot more to this story that i'm leaving out and i could write it in a more sophisticated way but whats the point English was never my strong suit at school. But i guess i'm here writing this because in reality there's no one of meaning who i can talk to.\n\nSee you later :(\n\nP.s It's quite ironic and kind of sum up this whole post i cant even post this here at this time 26/12/19 my account being too new/not having enough comment karma if you get the chance to read this post you i must of done something right.", "subreddit": "ForeverAlone"}

I\u2019ve had very bad luck with previous \u201cflings\u201d if you want to call them that, or possible Girlfriends but, always got screwed over. One girl was flirting with me and using me to get to one of my good friends, they ended up hooking up. Another girl flirting with me and leading me on, and openly admitted to it to my face she only used me because her and the boyfriend broke up. Basically a rebound. Met another girl and we got along really well, but it was too much toxicity. Had to break it off this past summer. Couldn\u2019t take the way she made me feel anymore, which was inadequate and always just played games with my head. \n\nI feel like I am constantly yearning for that relationship where I feel like the person is down for me and just me, someone that makes me feel appreciated, because of the past things that have happened to me. How much I would like to share my love with someone else and just feel that pure happiness that I look around and see others have. Someone I can just hug and look into their eyes, tell them they\u2019re beautiful, make them smile, laugh, or even just be around. I\u2019ve seen boyfriends get so mad when their girlfriends try and hug them constantly or playfully \u201cannoy them\u201d and Im here wishing I could even just get a glance or a hug from someone. \n\nI feel lonely everyday - that I will never find someone. I\u2019m afraid I\u2019ll be alone forever, which I feel at 22 isn\u2019t a good thought to have. \n\nSorry if this all sounds so blah, and so me me me, but it felt good to write it out and get it off my chest.

Yes, college is different in the sense that you are not stuck for 6 hours in school, and that makes me feel like I can focus my time on other things. I have never been able to relax or what my parents call \"chill\". I was bullied a lot in high school for being the skinny stick boy. Even in college, I don't stick around for very long as I have work from 1-7 pm. I have exchanged numbers with my classmates, but only for notes.  I spend most of the time reading books and exercising. The only friend I have is Netflix. I tend to avoid romantic specific genres as it envokes a sense of hopelessness and depression. Love is not something that I am searching for as it is not meant for everyone. It's only classified for the \"social people\", the people that can somehow connect with others in this \"god-gifted ability\". All social people have been blessed by God and God loves them. It's like everyone hates negative people so the ones who are going through a difficult time just get put down in life. The ones who are positive show how they are able to connect with others, share ideas, get into relationships, and talk about how grateful they are. If a man like me who is struggling because of isolation and loneliness wants to voice out, society will be like \"Why are you so pessimistic?\". It's like the world only cares about extroverts. If you are an introvert you will be labeled as the \"wise guy\". The introvert is supposed to give the extrovert advice for nothing in return. Doesn't this make you sick? Like you almost metaphorically want to puke? Why doesn't anyone want to help each other? We are supposed to be a community. It's as if the rich get richer and the poor get poorer. I always wanted to be socially accepted but as I got to my 20s, I just gave up and started living my life as a lonely isolated introvert. I feel like I live off the grid, even though I live in a city with 500,000 residents. The only time that I speaking is about work or through the drive-thru intercom. I see kids younger than me getting accepted into top Universities. I see kids who were once younger than me, becoming fully independent and really \"living life\". They go on trips with their friends and family. They post pictures on Facebook and Instagram about how much fun they are having. Many have a significant other and are rubbing it in my face like look how grateful we are. No s@#t Sherlock. If life were that easy I would have been just as grateful as you. Even in my family, you have a bunch of rich people who share their vacation photos and personal photos just to make it seem like they are living it. Sometimes I wonder if its all staged. How can people be so happy and blessed? What is wrong with me?", "subreddit": "lonely"}

Let me introduce myself, I am a 19 year old guy from india. This is my very first time writing somewhere about how I feel. Okay so I am a single guy and never have dated anyone till date. It's not that I have a fear of talking to girls or I am hideous or I am weird. I just find it difficult to get close to people.\n\nLet's start from the beginning folks. I used to be a fat kid actually an obese one. I had a rough childhood and am a single child. My parents too are single children themselves so I have no close family as such. Growing up was pretty rough. My parents fight every single day, from dawn till dusk. I grew up in a very toxic environment. Me and my parents were living in a small house, we had a lot of money problems and I was also a reason for their fighting still, and I grew up feeling very very fucking lonely all the fucking time. I was picked up on by kids a lot since I was a single child no one had my back and my parents never backed me. I hated going out in my society but I went every single day no matter what the other kids did to me because that was the only socialization I had. I had good grades in school and passed my 10th class with 80%. But after that I fell into some bad company. I started smoking a lot of pot. Used to smoke all day everyday. Class 11th and 12th, all I did was smoke pot, I don't remember those two years of my life. The pot was like a medicine for me, it helped me forget everything around me, it made my sadness go away, I didn't care about anything/anyone. All I wanted to do was get high all day everyday. Soon people found out that I was a major pothead and stopped interacting with me, p.s. consumption of pot is considered as a taboo in india. I did okay in class 11 and 12 and got admission in a good college. But I couldn't make any friends in college and continued to hang out with my stoner buddies. I eventually flunked my first year of college and my parents found out about my habit. They were really very mad at me about it. They used to lock me in the house to stop me from getting high. It took about 6 months for me to get rid of my addiction. I have been clean for about 2 months now. I had lost tremendous amount of weight due to smoking pot but in the past 6 months I have gained around 30 pounds since I was locked up in my house. I am again very depressed because of the way I look, not obese but overweight. It's like I have replaced my pot with food. I have no friends, to hang out with because all my earlier friends were stoners and I don't want to hang out with them.\n\nAround a year back, I was in an accident and have an ACL tear in my knee and cannot run/do exercise so I can't join any activities around town and spend my time and am stuck in the house.\n\nAlso 2 weeks back my grandma was detected with cancer. Which was also a shock for my family. Now my parents fight a lot more because of the money problems we are having. \n\nI can't type this shit anymore, I have a lot to express but have no fucking words for it. \n\nIt's like I have this heartache. A feeling, of my heart sinking. I want to hug someone and cry so fucking bad. My loneliness is killing me.\n\nPlease suggest me a way to turn my life around.", "subreddit": "lonely"}

But one thing I remember from my time on a place that I shan't name in line with Rule 4 (I am by far over with that ideology) is something I heard said in common day life as well; women are very attracted to money.\n\nI just don't get it. Are software developers not as rich as they should be or something? Because I hear all the time that women are attracted to money etc even more than looks, and software developers in America are LOADED but they don't get much attention.", "subreddit": "ForeverAlone"}

I'll share two specific stories in which where I would've unknowingly escaped fa or maybe in better terms, prevented myself from being an fa in the first place.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n1st opportunity:\n\nThis was back when craigslist personals existed. From someone who has absolutely zero success with dating apps, I can tell you right now that craigslist personals was 100 times better. Even if it never went anywhere, I would still get a decent amount of responses, whether from replying to someone's ad or vice versa. For this particular one, I posted the ad myself, basically in short looking for someone to date long term. I got a response from a very decent looking girl. She was a few years older but age wasn't a factor to me. I'll skip all the small talk stuff but eventually after chatting it up we agreed to meet up at wegmans. We did. I believe this was before I developed social retardation as we actually hit it off or at least I thought I did. We actually went on a second date at a Mexican restaurant. I remember what I got too. I got the quesadillas. So that date ended, which went pretty well and we kept chatting. This is where things took a bad turn. She ended up telling me that she had a condition called Lupus and she said it was very severe. I wasn't as bad at socializing and talking to women as I am now but I was still just as desperate as any fa would be. So I kept on being clingy, despite her very busy schedule and her illness. She eventually told me she didn't want anything to do with me anymore. I can fully say that I messed this up. I know you normies lurk and comment here but please don't be that a hole and tell me things that I already know. I know what I did wrong in retrospect. I don't know what's going on with her now. I hope she is fine though.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n2nd opportunity:\n\nThis is definitely one for the books. She was an ex from hs (she went to a different school though). The interesting part was, she didn't live too far away from me driving wise but back when we were \"going out\" in highschool neither one of us drove and her parents were super strict so meeting wasn't really too viable of an option back then. We only dated online which kind of sucked but it was what it was. We broke up, it ended and we went our separate ways. Fast forward to when she saw me at a local carnival thing when I was with my friend in early 2017. I got a surprise face book message from her. It was basically her telling me that she saw me with my friend and how she wanted to say hi but wasn't 100 percent sure it was me. All these feelings came flooding in as we hadn't spoken since our high school days and how meeting was a viable option now. So I asked if she wanted to come over. She came over and let's just say that I completely shot myself directly in the foot. It was so awkward and It was all on me. We were sitting down on my bed and we were joking around. I was joking with her telling her, \"you don't wanna see me with the hands.\" I was not being serious, I was playfully flirting or at least I was attempting too. She laughed and I took it upon my self to tickle her. She laughed more but I think it just made it even more awkward. I'm not some creep but I think I was so touch starved even back then that I didn't realize how creepy that was. It wasn't even sexual. I make music so I could've easily just shown her my music, watched a movie together like a normal person but instead I came off as an awkward, creepy dude. She left and I thought that it was game over honestly. At the time I was working at a movie theater. I called her and asked if she could pick me up from work and hang out. My car needed repairing and was getting fixed up at the time. I saw it as another opportunity to hang out with her. She picked up and actually said okay. So I thought wow so maybe I didn't mess it up that badly. We talked for a bit, she dropped me off and about a day later she had unfriended me. I messaged her with this long paragraph, pretty much telling her how messed up it was for her to lead me on, and that part I can still agree where she messed up on but I know I had my share of messing that opportunity up as well. All in all whether I felt lead on or not, I know I could've did things differently that would've changed the entire outcome.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI guess I wanted to share these stories because, not all fas don't have encounters at all. I know some don't and I sympathize as I'm part of that group now but it just goes to show how real this fa thing is, where even when I had these opportunities back then, I couldn't hold onto them. I let it crash and burn and reveal my faness and once you even subliminally do that, they will block you out of your life quite literally. I internalize my own stories as I recognize the sheer luck and opportunity it takes for most of us fas to escape. Craigslist personals doesn't exist anymore, dating apps forget about it, I can't get a single reply. I'm jobless, (applying for ssi due to my severe anxiety and inability to last a job for more then a week), friendless, and basically a socially retarded recluse. I can only imagine how much I would've improved had I just let my self win in these rare moment of opportunities, the experiences that I would've gained, the positive reinforcements that I oh so desperately needed and still need to this day. I just did not capitalize on it. I failed myself. I let my self down. I'm not in the space or situation to really get opportunities like this ever again and that's what makes me internalize this the way that I do. Had I found out about this fa sub sooner, I probably would've been more conscientious and maybe the outcome would've been different, changing the entire course of my life..My life always teaches me a lesson or a better to go about the situation in retrospect. It's always woulda coulda shoulda with me, like oh I could've did this different but in the end, I always end up regretting my decisions, replaying them into a different \"what if\" scenario and ultimately paying for them later.", "subreddit": "ForeverAlone"}

I have no way of finding out the girl's instagram, no contact of her at all. We all have that stupid voice speaking in our head saying \"it is weird to contact her out of the blue.\" \"It is not a good idea.\" This mindset doesn't help at all for someone who has never had a girlfriend. And since I am a member of this subreddit, of course I don't have the most extroverted life out there, in fact the opposite. I never kissed a girl, I am a virgin which I don't really care for. I usually stay home and play video games if I'm not feeling the urge to go outside with my friends. I have 3 guy friends that i text in group chats. Not very lonely. I guess my point is, is that it would be really nice to have a female friend to talk to and be with. I've realized that money doesn't buy happiness at all. Very TEMPORARY happiness and that true happiness is having fun with friends and family. After the girl said that I was cute, I just have the urge to converse with the opposite sex because it seems so fun (as long as they have the similarities and are interested) but it is extremely hard to find one if you are just home all day on your free time playing video games. I wish I knew a way to contact the girl but sadly I think it is too weird to go out of my way and other people's way to find like her instragram or her number.\n\nPS: PM's are welcomed for anyone that wants to chat and help me in the situation im in.

I am not hated and don\u2019t feel all that self conscious too often. However, I have incredible difficulty making friends. I went into 6th grade and made a best friend which quickly evaporated because I was a jerk. I don\u2019t know why I was, but I felt the need to pick at his insecurities. He trusted me enough to open up and I, for some reason, felt the need to put him down. ( Keep in mind he was the nicest, kindest, kid I\u2019ve ever met; He would never hurt a soul). \n\nAfter this friendship evaporated, I knew I had messed up. The next 4 years I didn\u2019t even try to make new friends. I was convinced I was an asshole and did not deserve anyone. I felt shame and guilt that was gut wrenching every time I thought about it and just could not pick myself up from it. Of course I apologized, and meant it more than you could know, but the friendship was far gone. \n\nHigh school came around and not much changed. I still felt the same guilt and shame. However, I always hid it and was relatively nice to people because I knew they deserved it. Eventually, mid 10th grade comes around and seemingly out of nowhere, I was in a big group of friends. 7-8 guys. They were AWESOME!!! We had a hilarious group chat and hung out literally every weekend. Life couldn\u2019t be better. I became incredibly close with one of them and this continued for about 4 months.\n\nEventually I noticed the group \u201cleader\u201d would poke at my insecurities and make back handed compliments disguised as \u201cjokes\u201d. I soon realized that he was a narcissist. (Doesn\u2019t feel empathy, needs to put others down to feel powerful, pretty much fucks with your head). I had to cut off the group and they all started questioning why and I could not tell them because i didn\u2019t want to smear the narcissist\u2019s name or \u201ctalk shit\u201d.

I am an \u201cempath\u201d (if you don\u2019t know what that is, maybe google a little. But essentially I feel a high degree of empathy to the point that it can be physically draining) I can give all my energy to make someone feel happier and I just want someone to do the same for me. \n\nThe loneliness hurts so bad. I just want someone to hold me. It feels so empty... Anybody...\n\nSorry if that whole story is jumbled but I just wanted to get it out.", "subreddit": "lonely"}

I have no problems striking up conversations. Lonely is not so easily defined nor cured. It's something else. It's something deeper. It's worst for me as I lay to sleep in the quiet. My loneliness becomes restlessness, anxiety, depression  and sadness.  One feeling becomes more. Each one more gut wrenching and desperate than the one before.

I\u2019m not one for bars too much now but I\u2019d have pints with friends that I had constantly and everyone kind of looked up to me simply cause I was 18, and I was hanging out with my brother and his friends who were almost a decade older and I genuinely fit in. Maybe a bit more mature than most 18 year olds, and sense of humour that made it easy to talk to me. I dunno.\n\nAt the time I had this job (which I still have) but it was just temporary. Now, I\u2019ve been told I\u2019m a bid modest about it, but it\u2019s another thing where people started looking up to me. It\u2019s got about 30 guys give or take and I\u2019m in line to be their foreman. At 23.

The way you interpret and understand the world directly affects your beliefs and the way you live your life. Everything is temporary. Knowing that it's not the end, and that it's just a rough patch. Life is full of twists and turns, ups and downs, and surprises. We forget that it\u2019s about the journey, not the destination. The importance of being present. We tend to worry about what's to come, or dwell on something that's already happened. While it's crucial to care and consider your future, be careful not to let it surround your present. Moments turn into memories. Enjoy the moment while you have it. Do what you love, love what you do. If you aren't happy in your career, that unhappiness will seep into other aspects of your life. And while nothing is perfect, it's important to work on yourself and position yourself to reach the goals and satisfactions you desire. Being happy takes work. One of the worst things you can do for self-development is comparing yourself to other people. It's easy to get caught up in jealousy and wanting what other people have. Being happy takes practice. Whether it's you learning to let go of your ego, or forming more self-loving habits...it takes practice.

Basically two nights ago was my Friends sister\u2019s 21st birthday. I don\u2019t see her much so I\u2019m not that close with her but we were invited to go out anyway. So it was her and 6 of her friends and myself and 3 of my friends. \n\nTo start the story the first two bars I actually felt alright cause they were laid back, one was an arcade bar which was pretty cool. But when we got to the last bar it was pretty packed and with a dance floor and by this point I was totally worn down. As a result this turned into everyone pressuring me into dancing and my Friends sister kept telling me that I need to dance and \u201cget out of my comfort zone\u201d and while she is correct it pissed me off. This is why I don\u2019t go out but they constantly ask me to come out like I\u2019m gonna change. \n\nEventually as we\u2019re leaving the last bar the prettiest girl of all the girls out with us that night , we\u2019ll call her \u201cLucy\u201d was pretty drunk and she could barely walk so she came up to me and put her arm around me. I guess to help her walk. Plus I\u2019m a pretty big dude (like 6\u20193 220) so I didn\u2019t mind and I wanted to make sure she was gonna be ok. We ended up walking to get to the train and the whole way we had this funny conversation where she was telling me all this stuff about herself and once we got on the train her friends asked me to sit with her. She ended up starting to rest/fall asleep on me head on my chest. And I had my arm around her waist. It felt great but at the same time I knew that night would be the only time it\u2019ll happen. She\u2019s really pretty and I\u2019m not. And when she wasn\u2019t drunk yet she didn\u2019t talk to me at all and only talked to my Chad friend obviously. So in the back of my head I knew she was only being like this because she was out of it. The train ride was about 30 minutes so she just laid there and I could tell everytime she looked up at me how tired she was but as the ride went on she started to put her hands on my stomach and on my leg and even grabbed my hand and we started holding hands. Again don\u2019t know why she initiated this somewhat physical contact every step of the way except for being drunk. \n\nThis is only the second time I\u2019ve held hands with someone or ran my hands through someone\u2019s hair or any of that; so while it did feel great I couldn\u2019t fully enjoy it because deep down I knew what was going on. Eventually we get off the train and walk to my buddies where i said goodnight to her and that was it. My buddy and I even made a bet that she wouldn\u2019t talk to me the next day when we woke up. And we were both right. When the girls woke up and came downstairs this girl already had her jacket on and purse in hand and left immediately. Didn\u2019t even say thank you or goodbye to me. It kinda hurt but I was expecting it. \n\nWhat did happen tho is My friends sister came to me and said \u201cjust so you know when Lucy woke up she told me she remembered falling asleep on you and said you were really sweet and that you\u2019re way too nice\u201d. That\u2019s all the closure i have. I\u2019ll never see this girl again so idk how to feel. I do know her name so I found her insta but I don\u2019t wanna follow her and be weird. Also, I would have gotten her number but my phone had been dead before all this had happened and actually at one point I held onto her phone for her....I felt like being a savage and calling my number on her phone so I could text her but I have 0 balls and was afraid to do so. Now I\u2019m laying here feeling depressed because i don\u2019t think last night was a good thing. Like I can\u2019t enjoy what happened because it felt like such a fluke.

{"post_id": "ehi59o", "created_utc": 1577685968, "title": "What is your employment situation?", "author": "someguy7734206", "self_text": "Basically, the questions are: Are you employed? If so, what is your occupation, and how much do you make? If not, how long have you been unemployed, and have you ever been employed before, and what happened to make you unemployed, and how are you supporting yourself, and are you seeking employment right now? In both cases, what is your education level and field? And, of course, what other information would you like to provide that is not covered by these questions?\n\nDespite the fact that I am certainly FA, I have avoided making any posts or comments here. I have lurked here quite a few times, unfortunately, even though I have been trying to avoid it because it just doesn't seem like it's good for me. But I decided to make this post because I have become curious. From what I've seen, we have people here both who are unemployed or working in a shitty dead-end job, and who have a successful career and are making a lot of money.\n\nAs for my own personal situation, I graduated from university in 2018 with a Bachelor of Science, with a major in mathematics and minors in physics and CS and a GPA of 2.0. Since then, the only things I have ever had are DoorDash (which I rarely do because the pay is so abysmal that I lose most of it in the gas required to do the job) and a temp job driving cars through an auction theatre at a car auction that has way too few hours to support myself with. My family is supporting me to make up for the rest of what I need. I have tried to apply for multiple software development positions and none of them want to hire me. There is a very small amount of hope right now, because some time ago, the employment agency I am in contact with sent me a posting for a company looking specifically to hire autism-spectrum disorder people (I was diagnosed with Asperger's as a kid back when that existed). I asked them to send my application, and after a questionnaire, informal interview, and code test, I'm at the stage where there will be an assessment period in January. The fact that I was able to make it that far means that there might be some hope of escaping the unemployment hole and stop relying on my family, but if I fail this assessment, then the message will be clear as to what my degree is really worth. In that case, I will probably give up looking for work that has anything to do with what I studied and just suck it up, stop being a princess, forget about the sunk costs of my student debt, and apply to all the shitty jobs in my area that I can find, accepting that I may very well be a cashier dealing with Karens for the rest of my life. (This is, after all, Canada, where tuition is not nearly as bad as in the states, but that might not be true for long.)\n\nThe reason I am curious about this is that I feel that a lot of the same traits that make me FA are also working to ensure that I never find decent employment: namely, my social awkwardness, complete lack of confidence, inability to market myself, lack of experience at a time when one would expect me to have more, and the fact that I basically have nothing to offer that an employer or romantic partner would want. Some traits definitely work more toward one condition while being irrelevant to the other, such as my not-very-good looks in terms of FA and my bad GPA and nearly-two-year gap since graduation in terms of unemployment, but I would say that most of them are common to both. Would you say that your case is the same?", "subreddit": "ForeverAlone"}

I don\u2019t see any point in constantly waging in battles with yourself when you know that the opponent has a strong case. I don\u2019t think I mind that tbh.

I hope I don\u2019t ever have to come back. I don\u2019t think I can do this on my own so I\u2019ll adopt a dog once I\u2019m done with my studies.

It's got me thinking about my life experiences in these three (relatively) close towns I've lived in. From my first crush, a girl named Ashely; my first friend, a girl named London; to where I stand now. I've been a lot of things-- in love, homeless, high, drunk, afraid, content, happy and lonely to name a few. Nothing profound, most people are these things at one time or another, maybe everyone is. \n\nThe first time I kissed anyone I was 7 years old. Nothing spicy, I was chivalrous and kissed her on the hand. It was my best friend at the time, London. \n\nI wouldn't kiss again for 8 years after that. It was my freshman year of highschool. The experience was a bit rough at the time but in hindsight is quite funny. The girl was short and well I wasn't expecting a kiss... She jumped up and chipped a tooth on mine. \n\nNothing happens for the next almost two years. Then I meet a girl and God damn I didn't expect this one. All folklore and lo-fi, a wilted flower in a window and loose secondhand clothes. I still listen to her taste in music today. She had this taste, this hunger for the authentic and real. Things she could touch or feel, taste or smell, see or hear. She loved other's passions even if it was just for the sake of the passion and not the thing itself. Things sparked up and flared up, then burnt out. Just a summer in the heat I suppose. It ended when I said \"I love you.\"\n\nThere's been a few people here or there. A boy crush or a few weeks of flirting that ended in nothing. \n\nStill, I have these scenes in my mind. All these little moments I've shared with people and they hint at something I can't quite grasp I don't think. If you're interested, I'll describe a few of them to you. \n\nSamantha and I. It's the homecoming football game. The crowd cheers and screens in the distance, the loud speakers blare the game narration. A ways from the game, Sam and I sit atop a building which is situated on a hill. We sit there watching the people roar then the crowds disperse into sunders. \n\nBella and I. It's at a party, weed, beer and vodka pollute the air inside. I'm a few drinks into the night but God people are loud and so afraid to be different. I go to sit on the rooftop, the roof sits at an angle. An hour or so later Bella appears on the roof. One of the two prettiest girls in the school, the other was her identical twin. There she is all teary eyed on the peak of a suburban home. At least for a few hours, she wasn't afraid to be different. It's the little things about people, really. The color yellow and how she was always afraid to wear it. The music she loves but none of her friends like. We almost kissed, but she was drunk and I wasn't about to let her regret a drunk kiss.\n\nAiden and I. Nothing much, just an evening on a bean bag chair. Him stroking my hair and god I just felt so beautiful for a while there. \n\nCass and I. We were close friends. One night we went to a bon fire, someone brought weed. We smoked a bit then after the fire, we went back to her house. We made out and all that. Nothing came of it. \n\nOne last story if you're still interested. I've saved the best for last. \n\nIsa and I. We met at a coffee shop around noon. Absolutely stunning. We drank some tea and went on a walk to a pond. We walked about the trails and the backstreets for a bit and then back to the area with street shops. A candy shop, a novelty store, a place which sold little rocks and necklaces. Then when the storm clouds rolled in, we climbed a fire escape. The building was on the side of a hill about halfway up, but it was high enough to see for miles and miles. All the car lights and the outlines of buildings all lined in white strings of stars. We played and sang songs on the roof for hours, throwing playing cards and ducking when cops rolled by. Then when the rain started, the cards got wet and weren't good for throwing. We laid there in the rain watching the clouds turn white-violet. Though the holes in the clouds we could see the sky turn dark and the stars show through the rain and storm. I fell in love with her. \n\nNone of these moments changed much. Just stories now I suppose. I wonder why I can't have more than one story with anyone. It's always just the one.\n\nEdit: spelling errors", "subreddit": "lonely"}

She is a hoarder, for one, and she hates other women, especially those who are younger or prettier than her. When I was in school, she used to actively discourage me from dating girls, and if anyone came over to my house (or I went anywhere) she would hover and try to interject herself into everyone's business. It was bad enough where people didn't want to come over. Its gotten worse since my father died. She calls and wants to go shopping, eat out, she doesn't want to do anything alone. Its also interesting because she never was this way with my siblings, and my youngest brother just recently got married.\n\nSo how many other FAs have similar experiences?

Sorry for those that hate seeing Success Stories.  Here was my original post from a few months back where I managed to get a date:  https://old.reddit.com/r/ForeverAlone/comments/dp8qq8/i_have_my_first_date_ever_this_weekend/\n\nI guess I have a girlfriend now.  First date went well.  We met for lunch, and I was too nervous and anxious so I was very awkward.  I was way too flustered and couldn't process what she was saying, so it was hard to have a flowing conversation.  Afterwards she showed me a place with arcade machines, and that was a lot better because we had an activity to do together.  Had a ton of fun, loosened up, we laughed and had a good time.  Went to the Exploratorium, had a fantastic time.  There was an exhibit where you sit on a metal bench and touch an electrical node, and if you touch another person it creates a shock- I was able to touch her hand for the first time with that, and then afterwards we held hands walking around the museum.  \n\nWe went on a few more dates, she asked if I would be boyfriend/exclusive with her.  I told her yes, and I also told her being exclusive was a no brainer because I had zero dating experience.  She was a little shocked at first, but after the surprise wore off she took it in stride.  Since she knows I have no experience, she goes out of her way to initiate and also be patient with me.  \n\nThis might be TMI, but I imagined that since I was a virgin, the first time having sex I was worried I would be too fast.  Well sort of the opposite happened, where it was hard for me to get erect, and when I did I couldn't achieve orgasm.  I guess its all those years of getting used to the feeling of my hand, and everything else feeling so foreign (also because of the extreme nerves).  Took about 5-6 times before it started working.  \n\nAnyways, that's pretty much it.

But later down the road, they both just stopped texting me or talking to me altogether (the 2 stories are pretty identical).

Im still wondering today if I did something wrong and screwed up, I never meant to make them upset in any way, shape, or form. Later on, they broke up with me over text (which really sucks), and due to my depression, made me really want to die. I still do small talk with one of my past girlfriends, but I dont speak at all to the other. All I really ask for is a girlfriend who is loyal to me and some one who loves me.

This could range from meeting more people IRL outside of work to simply just leaving a comment on a youtube video and everything inbetween.

I can't remember the last time I spoke to someone online in particular. Even the games that I play in recent years have all been single player orientated so I can't even meet people with that old method.

I'm 23 years old and have never had a gf. I'm a bit overweight, but I'm slimming down. Don't think I'm a bad looking dude, but I'm really insecure. Im an emotional guy with a big heart, but have only faced rejection in my \"love life\". I've felt singled out for most of my life and have anxiety of being abandoned by the people I care about. I think this is a result of being bullied in high school. My best friend getting together with my longterm crush didn't help either (This was years ago, it didn't take long for them to break up). Usually after a bad experience with someone I really cared for, I tend to loose interest in love, so I actually never really been into many girls. With my last crush being 4 years in the past now, I've developed a mind-numbing desire to find a girl. So I decided to try out tinder. I've always been hesitant to try it, because I want something real and not a one night stand.\n\nSo I matched with this girl that I started to like. We are different in many ways, but share our love for music and can make each other laugh. I met her two weeks ago and the first date was probably the best day in my life. She really seemed into me and put her arm around me, while we were sitting on a couch in a bar. We went outside and she kept initiating bodily contact and we held hands shortly after. It was pure bliss. She brought me to the train station and waited with me. When my train arrived I went in for a kiss and it fucking worked. First time I ever kissed someone. She looked at me in this way I've never been looked at before. It was fucking madness.\n\nWe started writing a lot and I asked her for a second date. We agreed to meet 6 days after the first date, but she got sick and called it off. Contact with her was already fading before the date, but at some point it came to be that she wasn't investing into the conversation at all. I felt/feel like such shit. I asked her about it and she told me that she was busy lately and didn't want to just write short answers. I think thats bullshit though because she was online all the time on whatsapp and when she did respond, the text was made up of a few words with no real input. She also told me she was also dating different men, which I obviously hoped she would take a break from after our kiss. Man I feel pretty toyed with. How do you kiss someone on the first date and then put your spare time into other guys, instead of seeing where we can go.. Shit sucks man. On one hand it's fucking tinder, what did I expect? On the other hand I really feel like the way she acts totally goes against how I handle other people. Feeling abandoned once again and trying to forget her, although we haven't formally broken things off.\n\nBasically venting, but also hoping hearing something from you guys/girls.

I'm fairly bright, but I'm not blowing my own trumpet, because at some point I became a depressed slug. But I'm not psychotic enough to hate myself more than I hate the world.\n\nEver been to the slums of South Africa? The West is only a decent pay cheque and a nice picket fence away from being a nation of savages who Necklace and decapitate and rape each other.\n\nMy life story is long and boring, so no need to go into that.\n\nI've been thinking about the details recently.\n\nI was going to get royally drunk and suspension-hang myself from the back of my bedroom door, but then I heard testimonies of how horrible asphyxiating can be. I mean, it doesn't sound so bad spending 2-3 minutes gasping for breath in terror, but apparently if you botch it up it can last for much longer than that, even hours. I don't think I'm prepared-enough for that.\n\nAlso, when I did some test runs, the hook I was hanging off, broke. And there's nowhere else I can find in the house that I can really do it. It's a bit of a cheap flat and I don't trust my shoddy plywood shelving unit.\n\nSo I've sort of done a 180 and turned my head towards the idea of drop hanging from a high tree branch, because spinal shock knocks you out in seconds, and then it's over. Experts say that once the spinal cord is dislocated like that, from a strong jolt to the neck, victims are likely to experience something like a loud bang and a flash of light... and then light's out for good. Just what I'm looking for.\n\nMy flatmate gets back on the 2nd of January so I think I'm gonna do this thing on New Year's Day, and leave a note to tell my family.\n\nI went out to Homebase today to buy some rope, but turns out it was closed, even though online it gave no indication and was telling me opening times. Fucking bullshit. So I had to go to Asda, but they didn't have rope - only thing I could find was [15m of cable](https://imgur.com/a/uuRC368) (I took the picture on my phone).\n\nWill this be strong enough and could it serve the same purpose as fibrous rope? Idk. Probably.\n\nI'm thinking I will leave a message in my pocket, and the last couple of days I've been coming up with cool one-liners while going on walks. For example:\n\n\"Winner takes it all. Loser has to fall.\"\n\n\"Goodbye cruel world.\"\n\n\"FUCK ALL OF YOU FAGGOTS.\"\n\n\"Winning wouldn't be fun if other people also had to lose.\"\n\nBut somehow these seem t00 edGy and immature. But I want to get across my thesis of lyfe, which is that, basically it's a rat race, and the winners get it all and the losers have to contend with their mental illnesses and their humiliation and their second-best accommodation with reality, resigned-hope sad-dog-eyes lives, and it never bloody ends man... until it does.\n\nI want to get across the idea that so many peples would be better off if they just had the stone cold nerve like me, to just fucking end it. Because if I go through with this (and I will), I will ultimately be the stronger party.\n\nI'll be a martyr.\n\nThere's too many slaves out there, collecting people's rubbish and not enough revolutionaries like me who want to rob the winners of their right to gloat, by... well, being not in a position to listen to their bullshit success stories.\n\nI'm also thinking I might do a Death Clue Game, where I make 10 intricately designed clues where upon people can follow them and decode them and find something interesting at the end. The dark truths I've learned, the experiences I've had... Hell maybe ugly and full of suffering, but it has such sights to offer!", "subreddit": "lonely"}

It\u2019s basically my life in the last ten years, my ups and downs. Feel free to read or ignore but I cleared my mind writing that and that\u2019s already enough for me. \n\nIn 2010 I was 10 years old, confident, innocent and happy I\u2019m pretty sure. I guess when you\u2019re that young there\u2019s not much to worry about. I was really good in school, always had the best grades and parents couldn\u2019t be prouder of me. \n\nFast forward to 2012, I got accepted to the best high school in my region and I was excited to start a new page in my life. I remember being super confident and thinking that I was going to make loads of friends. At first it went like that, I met a lot of cool people and I felt connected to them. Something was off though, I didn\u2019t feel like I was ever a part of them but more like outsider looking at them.\n\nNext year, 2013, I was put in a new class, I liked the people I was with, they were funny and interesting but I still felt like I didn\u2019t fit in. That\u2019s also the year my grades started to be lower. For the first time in my life I was failing a class and I didn\u2019t know how to tell my parents, I felt like such a disappointment to them. So like any kids would do, I tried to hide it, it worked for a while but then they found. I got grounded for afterwards and I started isolating myself from everyone. I wanted to have good grades but the pressure of succeeding was too much for me and I got really anxious. \n\n2014 was a low point in my life. Even though I met a friend that is still to this day my best friend, let\u2019s call him H cause I will refer to him later in this story, that year was the worst. I remember going in this school year thinking I was going to get better but it just got worst. I kept failing every math test and my parents were clearly fed up with it. I knew how disappointing I was but no matter how hard I studied I kept failing. I also remember vividly a moment this year were I was in my kitchen, my parents weren\u2019t home, and I just hold a knife to my throat, sobbing, and seriously thinking about just ending it all. Fortunately I gave up, I wasn\u2019t strong enough to do that, I remember thinking at the time that I was a coward but today I\u2019m grateful for it. Those suicidal thoughts kept happening for a couple of years, just wondering \"what if I just died right now\"; \"would people even care?\". I was really, towards the end of the school year I managed to get my shit together and passed the year. This summer, I played soccer, I didn\u2019t play it competitively since I was 9 or 10 so I was worried about it. Let me tell you, this didn\u2019t help, my dad, whose really competitive, always had something bad to say about how I played no matter if we won or not. This has given me a lot of anxiety and lowered my self esteem by a lot. \n\n2015 is a year were I decided to let myself go a little bit. I was tired of being watched by my parents so I decided to care a lot less about everything. At least that\u2019s what I told myself, on the inside I was still stressed about everything but I decided not to show it. The year went smoothly if were talking about grades, I wasn\u2019t excellent but I passed everything which was an improvement. My friend H also showed me one his friend, let\u2019s call him L. L was a nice guy but he seemed troubled, a bit like me, but I wasn\u2019t showing it. I didn\u2019t want to talk with him about that but it was clear. Us 3 met a lot that year and spent a lot of time together. For the first time in forever I felt free, free from responsibilities, free from anxiety, free from everything, in a way they might have saved me and they don\u2019t even know that. \n\n2016 was the last year of high school, I was happy about that but scared about the future, what would happen to with the people I know from school? A friend of H and L who happens to be a girl started hanging out with us, let\u2019s call her J. She was kind and always nice with me, over time I started developing some feelings for her but I was unsure about how I felt so I never said anything. In the middle of that she got a boyfriend and I thought to myself well there\u2019s that. But two weeks later they broke up and I was kind of happy. I decided to talk with L and H about how I felt and they told me I should be honest with her. To be honest that\u2019s not what I was looking for, I wanted them to tell me to not say anything. One afternoon I grew some balls and told her how I felt. She told me that like our friendship but didn\u2019t think we should be more. I was hurt but I just shook my head and said that I understands that. As the year went by we talked less and less, I just felt like I fucked everything by saying that. That same year L made some new friends which me and H weren\u2019t really trusting but couldn\u2019t force him to leave them. He started doing drugs and drinking a lot, we tried to tell him to stop but he wasn\u2019t listening\n\nAs 2017 began I was scared, I was now in college in a brand new environnement, with new people. The year had barely began that I read on the news that the cops were looking for a teen in our area who had disappeared, when I saw the picture my blood froze, it was L. Immediately I read the article, apparently he left his house late at night and never came back. I texted him but no answer. A couple of days later one of the people I knew from high school told me they found him he was okay but at home and his parents wouldn\u2019t let anyone talk to him. I was stressed, what had happened? I tried to focus at school but couldn\u2019t, H didn\u2019t know much more either. Maybe a month after that incident H texted me a number and told me to call if I wanted to talk to L. I got out of one of my classes and called the number. It was psychiatric house, I asked for him and we talked. He explained to me that he went out of his house that day to meet his other friends, the smoked a lot and drank even more. He got in a fight somehow and was brought to the hospital where he punched a doctor because he thought the doctor was tryin to hurt him. He was later on diagnosed schizophrenic and had to be held in a psychiatric house for a long period of time, plus he had to go to court for assault on the doctor. Learning all that at the same time just made me speechless, I didn\u2019t know what to say I felt responsible for not saying something before it was too late. I might have been able to help him I never said anything. I kept calling him every Friday, it was the only day he could receive calls, but it was hard talking to him knowing he was in such a bad state. This made me really depressive, I talked to some people in school, sometimes texted H, but other than that I just isolated myself from everyone. I didn\u2019t want to deal with what the world had to offer.\n\n2018 wasn\u2019t much different, I would\u2019ve loved for it to be a positive year but it wasn\u2019t. I honestly can\u2019t recall hanging out with someone more than 2 or 3 times that year. I was scared. I didn\u2019t want to go out, meet new people, even just text those people. That year I also turned 18, which is a pretty big deal here since I can legally drink, but I didn\u2019t have the heart to do it, I didn\u2019t want to turn out like L did. Most of the things teenagers would do like drinking, smoking and partying I decided to avoid. That year was pretty shit honestly, I was supposed to finish college but I failed some classes and had to do one more semester. My parents pretty much gave up on me that year, the golden boy that I once was was now replaced by this sad teenagers. Admittedly they know nothing that I just wrote about, I don\u2019t like to share with them, I feel like I\u2019m always judged by them. The year ended like it began, without hope. \n\n2019 felt like an important year. I got back in touch with L who\u2019s doing well now and thinking about going back to school. H is still talking to me, we try to hang out but our schedule never really match. I should go to university next semester to study in psychology and I\u2019m really happy about it. I started going to the gym at the beginning of November. I always heard about people saying how good for your morale it was to go train and I always felt skeptical of that. They might have been right cause I feel way better now. I also got back in touch with some high school friends and started hanging with them. I feel like I\u2019m slowly regaining my confidence and it\u2019s the best gift I could\u2019ve asked for. I haven\u2019t done anything special but I\u2019ve never felt this good in long long time and this makes me hopeful for the future honestly. I\u2019m still stressed but less anxious about stuff. For the first time I want to live my life, I used to say that I didn\u2019t care if I was to die tomorrow but now I want to live and experiment, I want to make others happy and help people who struggle. I haven\u2019t been the person in the last decade but O want to do more in the next one. I still think about that day when I was holding a knife to my throat ready to end it all and I\u2019m so happy I didn\u2019t have the balls to do it. I know how loneliness affects a person, how you can isolate yourself from people for no good reason but I also know that you\u2019re the only one suffering for that. Everyone has to learn at their own pace, it may take you a year, 5 year or even 20 year, but we\u2019re lucky to be here no matter how hard life is it deserved to be cherished. This was not supposed to be that long but it was great reminiscing about everything and it makes me even more grateful for life. Please everyone take care and I\u2019ll see you in another decade.", "subreddit": "lonely"}

Its gonna sound super anti to what I\u2019ve wanted but I feel alone and it\u2019s getting worse, I\u2019ve gotten to the point I cradle up in a ball in bed when I get scared of being alone forever. I\u2019ve tried a different amount of ways to make friends, talk to people, be nice, the list can go on and on. But every time I\u2019ve gotten scared to interact with said people getting fearful and worried of interactions overtime outside of work or a class, not wanting to show my face or my personality. I\u2019ve grown so accustomed to being alone that its here but it haunts me and makes me so sad yet comfortable. I tend to go to coffee shops or bookstores on my own and just read I\u2019ll simply just be on my own. I won\u2019t even have to turn my phone on silent to break my peace as I don\u2019t receive anything more than a YouTube notification on something i forgot to untap the bell icon, or a email telling me about some ad. My friends I have constantly joke around and never take anything serious and I can\u2019t fault them I joke too to make myself feel better for that few hour convo we have on xbox. But besides that we rarely text, or see each other anymore, any girl I talked to has left me or didn\u2019t talk to begin with. People tend to ignore me, make fun of me, not take me seriously or flat out just not hear me when I try to talk. Resulting in me raising my voice to be heard and then asked why I\u2019m yelling which makes me feel even worse because then I just look like a complete asshole. I used to be in friend groups that would make me feel so comfortable and happy like a family away from home but moving 14 times and 4 different highschools, now in college and struggling to even get by in that. Seems all like a good attempt but a huge fuckup and failure in life, I don\u2019t even feel happy anymore. I don\u2019t find things interesting like I used to buying things to give myself short term excitement to get me by but mainly spending time laying down or just wanting to cry but also nothing coming out. I have no dreams in life and I just want good for everyone yet I am starting to give up on myself and slowly feel like I\u2019m jumping deeper and deeper into a hole that will eventually end. I don\u2019t know what I want yet but I feel lost, empty, and hopeless. I don\u2019t hate myself or hate anyone or thing in my life, I just don\u2019t feel ok, or feel happy. I miss people and I wish they would talk to me like old times or even check in and say how have you been. But no one does that even when I\u2019ve done that for them. No one thinks of me not even my family to say happy birthday except of course my mother and father, my sisters abandoned me only coming back for the little money my dad had, and my dads side of the family completely disowned me as a cousin, nephew etc from the start. My mothers side being in serbia and not really being able to contact with us entirely so that\u2019s understandable but I still feel so alone and eventually if I find someone to have a family with idk if i will I\u2019ll feel so bad for them not having the huge family to fall on cousins etc. I\u2019m a loner and no one likes a loner.

My only hope for tomorrow is that I am sound asleep by no later than 8:30 PM. At least I have some hope, I guess... But I know me. No one else wants to know me, but I\u2019m forced to. In 24 hours, I\u2019ll be in tears. Unable to sleep. Unable to not watch. Listening to neighbors enjoying life. Fireworks. Laughter.... Yet it still feels so quiet.\n\nThis is what I\u2019ve become. I hate it. I hate myself. I hate this life :-(", "subreddit": "lonely"}

I showed zero effort in anything and I had suicidal thoughts multiple times monthly. \n\nI spent around five months, doing the same things. I lost 10 pounds. I was already a not so healthy 130 pounds, and it dropped to 120. Around May or June, I was diagnosed with depression (surprise) and a little afterwards, I was given antidepressants. I took those as often as I was told, but they didn\u2019t seem to help.\n\nLate July, something happened and me and my ex started talking again. I was happy, but deep down I wasn\u2019t. She was awesome and I loved having her in my life, so we talked. We talked and talked about giving it another go, because we both caught feelings again. We had been told so many times how we were the perfect couple, and so after a few months, we were so close.\n\nSo that puts us to late December. I was still depressed, but I was feeling less empty. Me and the girl got into a small argument, and I felt so bad about it and we talked about it. She decided that for a \u201creligious reason\u201d (I know what it is), it\u2019s best if we don\u2019t date. I was stunned, and since then she\u2019s barely talked to me or anything. She left, again\n\nMerry Christmas to me. My present? Feeling even worse than before. I\u2019ve spiraled even harder.

What happened that it's gotten so bad? What steps that I need to take to make myself feel better? To be happy again and not extremely lonely?\n\nThat is something each and everyone of us needs to do some introspection on and find the answer.

As I type this I'm feeling a bit better, the crippling loneliness is still there but it's no longer just building up and brooding inside.\n\nHope this helps someone else that is in the same boat as I am.

{"post_id": "ei0szv", "created_utc": 1577785295, "title": "I feel so alone even if I have a lot of friends and a loving family.", "author": "yoojin1222", "self_text": "I love to love and be loved. \nI don\u2019t like to say this with my own mouth because it sounds like I\u2019m trying to make myself look good but I\u2019ll say it. I am kind and caring. Two words that I used to look up and aspired to be but now feel like shackles and I\u2019d rather be selfish and feel less. \n\nI am in no means trying to make myself look good, I\u2019m just trying to paint the picture so please do stay if it doesn\u2019t get too obnoxious.\n\nI am in a sense kind. To me the kindest people in the world are those who do things even if they don\u2019t want to. Let\u2019s say there is a chair on the bus and someone stands up to give it to someone else. A person who doesn\u2019t mind is kind but to me the kinder person is the one who really doesn\u2019t want to but still does it. \nI am often in the middle. I take joy in knowing I am helping or making someone\u2019s day better. I go out of my way to smile and treat people respectfully hoping to myself that these small acts will make someone\u2019s day a bit better. \n\nBut true kindness is doing things that wouldn\u2019t be rewarded they say. \n\nI don\u2019t expect lavish gifts or rewards for my actions but I do hope that whomever would at least be a bit grateful for me going out of my way to do something for someone even if I don\u2019t really feel like it. And to strangers it\u2019s all the same. I\u2019m just hoping they may be a bit happier. \nBut to friends and family? \n\nI go out of my way to stretch myself thin so as to be of help to my loved ones. For instances my family. I live far away from home, my family although is kinda financially stable it sure could see some better days. I work two jobs and ask no support from my parents. They say they\u2019d send me some but I tell them to do so when we get more stable. I take care of the housework and try to help my brother in anyway. (I live with my older brother who although a good human being isn\u2019t really a responsible person.) to be honest I came here for college so I could ease my parents worries about my brother who was living alone. I got into the third best university in korea to make my family proud. I try so hard to maintain a good appearance so that I could be a friend and family member to be proud of. \nI\u2019d make time in a very busy schedule to hang out with friends and give them the attention, time, and effort. \nExample, it was my friends birthday. I had work in the morning and a test the next day but I just crammed as much study time the week before just to make time to properly be able to celebrate her birthday.\nThere are many more instances like these. With my aunt, with coworkers, etc. \nAnd in the end of the day I sit back and hope that they will appreciate my efforts.\nBut my birthday was on the 22nd my aunt whom I time and time again helped when she was in a pinch asked me to work an 9 hour shift when she tells me all the time how wonderful of a boss she is and how, when her other workers have birthdays she gives them a day off. But I who was there from the day she opened her business, was there to help her settle, I who crashed my health hoping that it would be easier for her, I who by the simple fact that I love my aunt would work 6-7 days a week so she could settle down, gets a worse treatment than a part timer who started a month back?? The same goes for my family and friends. All I got is a text of \u201chappy birthday.\u201d \nI know that I in sense am not kind if I expect a sort of reward. But today I got an angry call from my mother saying \u201coh? So now that you are 20 you think your so grown up? You think that now that you are an adult you can do whatever you want?!\u201d\nAnd the answer is no. I am a child who craves love and recognition. I lay at night and cry myself to sleep because I am tired. So so very tired. I was thrown to adulthood and I am trying to do my best but things just slip by my fingers and I am sad how I am at the flower of my youth and I am wasting it away. \nI think I\u2019m depressed to be honest. I\u2019ve been like this for the longest time, probably middle school. But I just want someone who appreciates the small and big things that I do. Someone who I am enough for. \nSomeone to tell me that I\u2019m doing good and that they are proud of my accomplishments. \nI just want to be loved. I have many friends and a wonderful family. \nBut I have no one who looks at me. Like really looks at me. I am not the happy, pretty girl I show everyone. I study late into nights to get good grades. I work endless hours to support my brother and I. I work so so hard to be as attractive as I can be. And all for who? All for what? \nI guess this is all just angsty 20 year old talk but even if my brain understands that I might be being stupid the fact that I feel so empty and sad does not change. \nDoes anyone else feel this way? Do you need me to listen to you just like you read through my ginormous monologue? Maybe we can hear each other and make ourselves a little less lonely? \nI don\u2019t know all I want to say is thank you for reading this helluva of a long rant. I hope that for as sad as I am you the reader is as happy. \nHoping the New Years is going to be a new start for all of us. \nPlease be happy. And one last time thank you.", "subreddit": "lonely"}

I keep praying and God is helping me but its slow going. I keep thinking 2020 is going to be a great year though and I went and sat and watched the sunlight stream into our dining room this morning and sat down and spent time reading the bible and just trying to be thankful for the moments themselves.Small things like sun through a window. That always makes me feel good. I love sunlight. \n\n  Trying to put my thoughts away from people because i know i dont have a place in this world but they always trail back there. Theres a lot of joy and beauty to be found in this life that has nothing to do with people. But i always feel lonely and like somethings missing. Then i think i should be more grateful for the good things i do have.  Ive also been trying to do my best to be kind and compassionate and help where im able even if people hate me. Not that most hate me but you know what i mean. It feels that way sometimes.  Starts feeling like i have no place even in my own place. \n\nI go from desperately wanting to talk to somebody to not ever wanting to be around people again.  Im also trying not to be so butthurt about life and emo etc. I know lifes not like a lifetime TV movie but id also like it to not feel like a horror movie too. \n\nIm 44 and ive watched the world turn into something i dont even recognize anymore. Thinking about our neighbor she was 90 years old so she lived a long full life. But i can only imagine how strange and alien the world must seem after being alive that amount of time. So many changes. Im not great at change but im trying. Broke down crying earlier when my wife was going back to sleep and she asked me whats wrong and i told her i just felt overwhelmed. Only lasted a minute i told her i didnt need to talk or anything and really i dont i guess. Washed my face and getting on with the day. About broke down again thinking about that moment. \n\nToday is new years so all that holiday crap is gonna be going on today too. I dont even care about any of that i just want to get on with the business of living. Wouldnt mind having a few beers but i know that aint gonna help my mindset. I dont feel like im on a tightrope. More like a see saw back and forth.  \n\nHope it levels out and i hope your day is going good and you find something that makes you smile today. I know im not much help lol . Anyway have a good one and thanks for reading if you did. Take care.", "subreddit": "lonely"}

When we first got together I was pregnant, and he managed time well with playing with his friends online. However that pregnancy was extreamly hard on my body, and he wasn't able to go out with them as much. But he still happily talked and played with them. Everyone seemed to understand. As somedays I couldn't even get out of bed without help.\n\n After the baby was born my fiance had to play less and less, since our first was a bit of trouble. Collic and really bad allergies made him a fussy baby, he was also just fussy in general. Long sleepless nights. Work also kept him pretty busy during the day. Due to all of this, for the past 2 almost 3 years, he became uncomfortable in a group setting. It didn't help that the group would forget about him a lot. He ended up feeling like an outsider. The entire time his friends said they understood everything.\n\n One of his best friends got an appartment, and the group has a get together every weekend. My finace would go and hang out for a few hours while I stayed home and did whatever. He had to clear up a few things, like how hurt he felt when they just left him even when he tried to talk to them. After that he was alright, but he needed help calming down if the social interaction became to much.\n\n He asked his two best friends to do it. Since they know how to calm him down, and I wouldn't be there. He said it worked out fine, he used my switch to get some alone time and calm down with the various games I have on there. If that didn't work he'd ask his friends for help. It was a fun time for him and he was becoming less worried about it.\n\n Out of no where one of his best friends texts him, saying he can't be at the appartment because he's ruining her progress. When asked about what progress, she didn't respond. She never responded. Not to anything. Not a christmas text, not a text saying he wanted one of his games back, nothing. Just \"don't come here.\" And nothing else.\n\n Now no one will talk to him. Only his other best friend will. Everyone else just hasn't said a word. He tries, he texts them and everything, but no one responds. He feels a bit lonely now, and I'm not sure what to do. I've been the one encuraging him to go out with them, talk to them, and even helped fix a couple of his friendships. I don't know what to do here.", "subreddit": "lonely"}

I hated being FA for a long time and considered the social ostracization and general disgust women had for me as a sexual being to be intensely painful so I figure any dude or chick out there who is able to find someone who sees him as a person worthy of love is never a bad thing. My failure isn't made worse by their success and their failure won't make me less FA, so I've never had a reason to hate someone else for escaping the FA nightmare.\n\nBut one trend I've been seeing more and more are normie pricks who want to offer us their same bullshit advice to use that doesn't work, but doesn't want to risk being called out as an asshole for doing so.  So **normies have been basically giving the same bad meme advice, but couching it in a phony story about how they \"just escaped FA and now you can do it too!\" to make their BS more believable and make it less likely to be rejected out of hand.** I've seen these a lot in the past couple of months.  They are incredibly rude and disrespectful to the community and, unfortunately, often sucker people into taking bad advice seriously.  But the good news is that this shit is easy to spot:\n\n**1). Check the person's post history.**\n\nDoes the person have no prior posts in the FA sub, just the one telling you they escaped?  Even worse, does the person have no post history at all?  It's true that there are plenty of people here who use throwaway accounts, but there's a difference between a person using a throwaway account to post about being FA and then posting that they escaped rather than a person who creates an account and their very first post in this sub is about escaping being FA.  How does that even make sense? Why would they even be looking for an FA board if they are no longer FA just to tell people that they were in our boat, but are no longer?  It doesn't make any sense unless the person has more nefarious intentions.\n\n**2). Watch out for red flag statements.** \ud83d\udea9 \ud83d\udea9 \ud83d\udea9 \n\nThere are certain common bullshit phrases that every normie giving shit advice uses, as if they are all working from the same playbook.  If you see a post that uses the words 'mindset,' 'negativity,' 'circlejerk,' 'echo chamber,' to describe this sub, they probably are phony FAs pretending to be one of us and are hoping that story will lend their viewpoint more creedence (a lot of ex-FAs do this on this board too).  They also will almost always invite people to 'pm me so I can help.'  I am not sure why, but that is pretty much the universal red flag for an asshole here.  Normies do it, and so do fake FAs who 'escaped.'\n\n**3). Check the backstory - does it make sense?**\n\nDoes the person's backstory basically mention every FA trope under the sun?  Or even worse, claim that they don't have one and that they were just shy and decided to \"just be confident\" and that it worked? It's weird as fuck and people who generally post fake stories write them in a way that makes it pretty clear they have no idea what being FA means, why we are FA, what issues we have, and are basically trying (badly) to fake it by repeating every stereotype about adult virgins you've seen on TV and in movies and hoping it sticks.\n\n**Closing Arguments**\n\nIf you want to try your luck at this technique, just go find a success story posted in, say, the past two days, and apply this formula to see if it is legit or fake.  Go forth, my peoples, and never let yourselves be snared by the wicked and the proud.\n\n**Edit: Bolded a portion of the post because two comments on the thread demonstrate that people aren't paying attention to the important bits (or don't care).**", "subreddit": "ForeverAlone"}

Last year we had a new student who joined our group and me and her hit it off fast and I was really into her an all that (stupid stupid stupid). She was also the first woman I've slept with so it had some extra feelings involved from my end. She decided to break it after about a month and I was pretty ok with everything considering my situation before meeting her and I knew she moved on dating others (oh the wonders of having no social disabillities...) and even though it did hurt at one point I was fine... Maybe not fine I don't know...  Unfortunately I have some years of experience with depression and anxiety, namely social so everything is mixed up with that. But overall were on good terms and I felt good for most of the time.\n\nAround summer we got closer again and all my feelings were amplified, and she calls me one night sweet talking me and all that, saying she wants us to have sex again but doesn't wanna ruin our friendship or whatever that is. I told her how I felt, that I do not want to be her \"friend\", that I want her to be with me. The feeling wasn't mutual and it hurt me bad.\n\n3 months later she now has a boyfriend, and I am utterly destroyed. Just the sight and sound of her talking gives me anxiety and pain. I try to hide it when I'm around due to obvious reasons, but it's just getting harder. You know, dealing with my depression has led me to always try to evolve onward, be empowered, acknowledging my thoughts and all that mindful bullshit but I am just tired of fighting my own mind. I am tired of keeping strong - I don't want to be fucking strong. I want to have the confidence to be weak, to let my guard down. Like, what's the point of living this life if I am relentlessly conflicted? I swear the pain I feel is physical, and there is so much of it. \n\nWorst thing is that both of us have a few years to work side by side as she is now full time in. I have no intention of dropping my current research, but that shit is tearing me apart and this is my fault only. I am scared so much that I will always be alone. My friends are all in thriving relationships and I hardly see them anymore. How the fuck do people even meet women? How do I get a hold of myself before I spiral again?

It is ironic that after all this time I was looking down on other people's personal drama I have become engulfed in one.  Fuck everything and fuck new years.", "subreddit": "lonely"}

Mostly because of our luck of social skills and thus our inability to create meaningful relationships.

Yeah that's right they \"p o i s o n e d\" us, and the poison they used was a childhood full of negativity, fighting/yelling , arguing DAY and NIGHT over the stupidest things ( not caring about whether that affects their children or not ). Others were poisoned with insecurities and anxiety, some really unlucky ones have panic attacks, and all of this because they were overly protective and overly strict. \n\nDont feel like you deserve all the shit that you're dealing with. \n\nAs the famous saying goes &lt;&lt; being weak is not a problem, staying weak is &gt;&gt; \n\nHow do you expect to be your ideal self if you weren't given the appropriate tools to achieve that goal \n\nAfter a certain age though, we have to create those tools for ourselves and let go of the burden that was bestowed upon us . \n\nCut yourself some slack, if it was up to you from the start you'd be better off now \n\nHappy new year to everyone, i hope this post will make even a single person dm me that they felt inspired : )", "subreddit": "lonely"}
