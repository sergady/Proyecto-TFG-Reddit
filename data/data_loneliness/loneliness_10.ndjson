{"post_id": "dbn73i", "created_utc": 1569899652, "title": "Seven Deadly Fallacies", "author": "[deleted]", "self_text": "I couldn't help but notice a few fallacies with normie logic as of lately. Lemme make a list in what would be considered a shitpost for outsiders \n\n\n\n\n**1 : \"It worked for me!\"**\n\n\n\nThis is one of *the* most infamous adages spewing from the shit fountain nowadays. \"If someone like *me* can get a girlfriend, there's no reason why you shouldn't!\" It pisses me off to no end, because it's almost close enough to be considered my second point:\n\n\n\n**2 : \"Well x worked for me, so it should work for you too!\"** \n\n\n\nThis is not to be confused with the first point, in the sense that the first idea brings mention to a *person,* not so much a verb. \n\n\nGood examples of the second point are:\n\n\n - \"After I got a haircut my crush asked me out! Just **shave** every now and then, bro!\" \n\n\n - \"Maybe if you went outside every now and then you'd find a girl! I met my girlfriend at the &lt;park | club | work | Starbucks | brothel&gt;!\"\n\n\n - \"Get more hobbies, bro! Lift! Get a therapist! My shrink helped get rid of the baggage I carried around and then I met Charlotte and then we got married and and and hurrRRRRRbllllppppttttt\"\n\n\n\n\n\n**3 - \"You're alone because of your shitty attitude! Be positive bro!\"**\n\n\n\nI hate number three for several reasons - many of which could probably go without saying. The people that say things like this are all too eager to stonewall you at *every* corner. Imagine being in a maze, except the walls keep closing on you every time you get closer to the exit. \n\n\n\n\"You're not confident, bro!\"\n\n\n\n\"No, bro! Now you're arrogant! Tone it back!\"\n\n\n\n\"Why are you so quiet? Are you a school shooter!? Speak up for yourself!\" \n\n\n\n\"Why do you backtalk everyone? You're a &lt;dick | bitch&gt;!\" \n\n\n\n\n\nAnother thing that I fuckin hate is: \n\n\n\n\n\"yOu'rE EnTiTlEd aNd dOn't dEsErVe a gIrLfRiEnD\" \n\n\n\nYeah, **excuse me for fucking being human and wanting someone to make me feel wanted.** \n\n\n\n\n\n**4 - \"There's someone for everyone, bro!\"**\n\n\n\n\nIf you wanna piss off a F.A, this is the easiest way to do it. Myself included\n\n\n\nIf there's \"someone for everyone,\" how do you explain all the people that die alone every year? After a quick google search, I couldn't be bothered to go further than \"a lot\" as a respectable number of people, but it's too many, to say the least.\n\n\n\n\nPeople die alone - and that's not by choice. If this post was a seminar, it'd be **now** that I'd ask the audience to raise their hand if they would WANT to die alone, and I guarantee you **nobody** would. Who the fuck would? \n\n\n\n\n\n**5 - \"You're not deserving of a girlfriend!\"**\n\n\n\nThis one pisses me off, too - no surprise, right?\n\n\n\n\nWho the fuck are you to decide who does and does not deserve to be in a relationship? As if you're any more important than the next guy. Not to say this statement's exactly wrong - because after a long, hard look in the mirror, I'm inclined to agree. \n\n\n\n\nIf we're leaving looks alone in this point (5'4\" guy with glasses and a fucked up face), I honestly don't think I'm mature enough to be in another relationship.... It'll be **years** before I can confidentially say I'm ready, but until then I have a *lot* of shitposting on reddit to look forward to \n\n\n\n\n\n\n**6 - \"Look don't matter, bro!\"**\n\n\n\nLemme put this to rest : **Yes they do.** Girls can't fuck a personality. NEXT\n\n\n\n\n\n**7 - \"Love yourself first!\"**\n\n\n\n\nLook I'm aware there's not a lot of people here that have been in a legitimately committed relationship. I'm almost ashamed to call myself \"F.A\" seeing as I've had the extraordinary pleasure of being able to call someone mine, albeit but a short time. I knew the girl for five years.... And during that entire time, not **once** had I ever loved myself - not for a second. \n\n\n\n\nNot like I'd go out of my way to constantly put myself down, but I was mostly there for *her.* I don't fucki'n know why she stayed as long as she did -- maybe she liked feeling wanted and there wasn't someone better that came along for a while.\n\n\n\n\n... Or maybe there **was** someone better and I just didn't know. I dunno- but I wouldn't have put it past her. She was a beautiful girl that could'a snagged *any* guy she wanted \n\n\n\n\nAnyway, we're not here to psycho-analyze me or somethi'n -- we'll leave that for my obituary when I die of a coronary some 40 years down the road at an all-you-can-deep-fry buffet in East Texas, donning my 35-gallon hat and .44 magnum on my hip, going out with my boots on. \n\n\n\n\nAh, yes.... That'd be the life. \n\n\n\n\nAnyway there's my rant for the night. I hope it helps you understand some of the mind games the normies try to play on us, as a tactic to belittle the community here and make themselves feel better. Dunno why it happens, but it really do be like that\n\n\n\nBy the way, I'd just like to **EDIT** this post as a \"screw you\" in advance to the people that are downvoting me without even reading the fuckin post in the first place", "subreddit": "ForeverAlone"}

I even tried setting up a Match profile but that lasted all of 5 minutes. I was kinda okay going through the questions, they were quite simple but wen it got to selecting a picture of myself I just locked up.  It\u2019s always been a bane of mine that I don\u2019t have many pictures of myself.  I\u2019m a 22 year old guy and have never been appreciative of how I look. It obviously doesn\u2019t help that I have a hard time controlling my diet and fail to keep a regular schedule of using the workout room at my apartment complex. Anyways I tried skipping the picture and going to the site.  I just couldn\u2019t take the feeling of the site, I hated how it made me feel. I deleted it promptly and haven\u2019t looked back since.

And for a time, it was good.

However I've been single for the majority of my adult life now (since I was 20 - I'm 24 now), and as melodramatic as it sounds, I sometimes wonder if I'll ever find love again. I'm very particular about what I look for in a person. Ironically, those who I would consider dating usually aren't interested in dating me. I think I'm girlfriend material, but I feel like I'm not when it comes to guys I actually like.\n\nSometimes I feel like I'm unworthy of finding love until I get to a certain point in my career (or until I've made something of myself), but I feel like that's unfair to myself. I see people around me find love regardless of where they're at in their careers and my life has been void of a passion for so long. I have friends, but it's not the same. I do my best to focus on my job, hobbies, and ambitions, but these days I'm beginning to feel an emptiness. I know love isn't something I can force or rush - it's something I honestly don't think I have any control over. I don't like dating apps, because it feels too desperate and forced. I know I just need to be patient and live life and trust the process, but it's been 4 years and I'm just lonely.\n\nRecently, I did meet someone I started to like, he just wants to keep it casual and I'm acting okay with that, but I realized it does hurt me to see him hang out with other girls. In reality, casual flings just make me feel even lonelier, but having nothing at all is worse at times. I just want to love and be loved in a romantic way. I hate how everyone these days seems to have their guard up. I feel like everyone is scared of feeling something deeper so they settle on surface-level pleasure. I get it, those things are nice, but they're so fleeting.\n\nI just want to meet someone who sees me for all that I am and appreciates me.

You think FAs are some sort of feral wolf children? We know about basic hygiene, thank you very much.\n2. \"*Lift, dress stylishly, get a haircut*\". Superficial stuff can't help us with our mental issues, and for the vast majority of people here issues are mental, not physical. Not to mention that we've already heard that dozens of times.\n3. \"*Be confident*\". You can't be confident if you're not successful. And faking confidence is one of the worst advices of all time, if not the worst.\n4. \"*Talk to people more*\". Talking to people is pointless for most of us - we are fucked beyond repair, so even if we can hold a conversation (which even on itself is very difficult), it's not going to result in any meaningful connection.\n5. \"*X worked for me, so it should work for you*\". All people are different, in case you didn't know. If something worked for you, it **might** work for someone else, but it might not.\n6. \"*There is someone for everyone*\". Statistically speaking, it's true. However, since you physically can't ask out \\~3.5 billions of members of the opposite sex, this has no practical value.\n7. \"*You'll find someone when you least expect it*\". No. Only someone who has a large social circle would. FAs barely have anyone to talk to, we aren't getting introduced to new people by friends and coworkers.\n8. \"*Just focus on other aspects of your life*\". I, personally, would give all my money to kill my need for companionship completely. I'm sure a lot of people here would. Unfortunately, we are hardwired to seek love and affection. Wuthout it, everything else is dull and colorless.\n9. \"*Only 400 lbs neckbeards who treat women like walking sex dispenser machines will remain alone, everyone else can find a loving partner*\".

I have to stop myself from being driven by love, I obviously wish I could let my love find a victim and not be concerned about it. It makes me smile to imagine I'm with a loved one who could make me feel loved. I could hold their hand or make them smile or hug them. It really makes me happy to think about things like that. They don't even have to be there, as long as it's a loving exchange of words.\n\nI have qualities that will make such a relationship poor for the other person. I think I could potentially be a bad partner. I don't think I should have those qualities and that relationship at the same time. What's unfortunate is that it will never stop me from wanting that kind of connection, so I imagine I'll eventually set myself free.\n\nI've tried to interact with people online to see if I can form a relationship not like above, yet have it be one that will satisfy me. The sample size is really small, so there's some hope of success. Upon learning someone is male, I quickly lose interest in forming a relationship. When I learn someone is female, I continue communicating. I've been what I think is a caring friend to some, and that feels good. But I had a secret hope of that friendship developing into something bigger, and the action made by that hope is very quick. So making friends doesn't seem to be a solution, but again it's a small sample size. I've considered purely sexual relationships. I haven't had one, and haven't tried having one. I'm sure I'd love having one. I believe I'd be quick to love the partner, that's what could go wrong. I may be too focused on what might happen though, rather than trying things out and assessing things. But I predict having a friend with benefits or something like that won't work.\n\nMy final solution is to have a pet (tortoise for sure, though I don't know if I'd feel loved by a tortoise). I can love it without the possibility of becoming evil to it, and perhaps they could love me back. Unfortunately I'm not in a position to have one, when I'm not living with parents who don't want an animal in the house, I'm living in accommodation that doesn't allow pets.\n\nWhat do I do?

My senior year was wonderful, I had so many friends and someone always wanted to spend time with me outside of class which was really nice, also going to a pretty small highschool everyone knew me and said hi in the hallways or in classes. Of course though I lose that social life I had after I moved to my dorm about an hour away from home, ever since I got here ive spent most of my days locked into my room hiding from everyone because I think they already have negative thoughts towards me.

We tried everything imaginable for us. All the self improvement we could. We exercised, we improved our wardrobe, we made more connections with people and expanded our social network, we improved our social skills, we improved our money, we learned new skills etc. However, we are still repeatedly failing at getting out of this situation. We still get rejected and ghosted repeatedly and get told constant excuses a.k.a. friend zoned as to why we're not getting anywhere. Some of us spend years and even after years are still self improving far more then the average person who gets success, but we get no success still. Worst part is you spend all this time climbing the self improvement ladder and you get to nearly the top of the ladder then society tips the ladder over and you go falling off the ladder onto the ground.\n\nThen while you're on the ground society surrounds you and they tell you that you're just failing due to not trying hard enough, you're a loser, you're not good enough etc. etc. Why do we even want to try to appeal to these people who we say treat us poorly because of FA? The ultimate irony of FA is we're trying to appease people who treat us very poorly because of being FA. Do we even want to be in relationships with these people who deem us not acceptable for a relationship? These are the same people who tells us there's something wrong with us in our current state and we need to self improve and keep trying harder to reach a state that makes us worthy of dating or love.\n\nYou really have to step back and question if it's worth trying to go through all the insane effort to appeal to society when another person can walk right in have success and hasn't done any self improvement in their life. We're fighting a losing battle. At every turn it's a constant uphill battle for us FA people. When you keep banging your head against a wall repeatedly for years and years with no success you gotta be real with yourself. Take a step back and say that perhaps you shouldn't fully invest in escaping this situation. Note that I am not saying to give up. Just to invest less effort into escaping and to focus that effort elsewhere in your life where you are seeing that your effort pays off. Since right now for some of us FA 100% investing into self improvement to escape FA is not working for us. Invest your full 100% effort somewhere where you see the results pay off. Still try to improve of course to escape FA, but maybe be a little less obsessive about it(easier said than done of course) and maybe put 80% effort into escaping it and put that 20% somewhere else etc. The cost to benefit ratio is very high cost to very little to no reward.", "subreddit": "ForeverAlone"}

What is it that separates someone who has been able to get into a relationship from someone who wasn't?  \nFace? Height? Weight? Money? Social status? Sense of humor? Some personality traits?  \nAnd I came to conclusion that none of that is key. There are tall people in a relationship and short people as well, there are tall single people and short single people. The same thing can be said about literally everything else.  \nNo factor, or even a combination of factors gives you a 100% guaranteed romantic success. A person who can attract anyone he/she wants doesn't exist.  \nSo here is the conclusion - **attraction is uncontrollable and unpredictable.**  \nYou can't force it, you can't predict who will be attracted to you and who won't.  \nSo what is my advice?  \n**Get to know as many people as you can.**  \nJust to be clear, I'm not saying that self-improvement should be thrown into the trash can. I believe that rather than seeing self-improvement (becoming fit, making money, striving to achieve your goals, getting rid of mental baggage, whatever self-improvement means to you) as a \"solution\" for the FA problem, it should be seen as something that you are doing for you own sake (I mean, it's called **self**\\-improvement after all). In other words, it should not be seen in the context of relationships and dating.  \nWhen you toss a coin, you have a 50% chance of getting heads and 50% chance of getting tails. You can't change those probabilities, but you can toss the coin until you get heads.  \nI'm essentially saying that you should do the most difficult thing for an FA - talk to as many people as possible and get rejected dozens, or even hundreds of times. You have a crush who doesn't like you? There is **nothing** you can do, move on. You want \"do *x*, *y* and *z* to attract someone\" type of solution? It doesn't exist.  \nSo, ladies, gentlemen and others - we are doomed.

Despite our directed efforts, the task is never accomplished, leaving us even more down and hopeless.\n\nI think I realised why. Social interaction and ability is meant to be innate, ingrained in (nearly) all of us. Its one of the things that make us humans successful, working together, putting our collective thought process and planning and socializing and networking to accomplish a task.\n\nIf you're one of the unlucky ones to be socially anxious, high-inhib etc. we have to make a conscientious decision to do this. Some can master this until it becomes natural. For others, it can come across forced and awkward, and create a vibe of desperation or just general weirdness. \n\nIts like breathing. Everyone can breathe normally without thinking. But if for whatever reason you suck at breathing, imagine consciously inhaling and exhaling every time you breathe. It'll be off-putting, and hinder other things you're trying to do. Or it's like swinging your arms while walking, or refocusing your eyes when viewing something close then far, or checking before crossing a busy street.\n\nMost of the social successes I've had have come from times where socialsing is completely out of my mind, cause I'm focusing on something else. For instance, I was looking for a shop selling cigarettes at night, and came across a group of people smoking. I asked them for a spare cig, and we just started talking. I wasn't focusing on the interaction, it was in the back of my mind. Of course, it went great - we even decided to go to a pub together cause they liked me. \n\nBasically, try not to stress about socialising too much. If you're going to a club or party or society or gathering, socialising should *not* be in your mind. Focus on other things, like dancing or doing the activity at the society. If someone starts talking, hop in but don't focus on it. If someone starts talking to you, talk to them like they're an NPC offering you a side quest. Be friendly and shit, not too bothered but not hasty. Most people talk to others out of habit, not cause they have anything interesting to say.\n\nTL:DR - Before you go to something, **do not daydream about how it'll go and create cool scenarios in your head about how you'll talk to people**. You're already putting yourself in a box. Just think about something else, like what food you're gonna get that evening or something.

It\u2019s like the calm acceptance that comes after you\u2019ve realized you pretty much have to be alone. When you google things like \u201cCan\u2019t love\u201d of \u201cmust be alone\u201d or \u201cnot wanted\u201d everything that comes up is about self-worth. \u201cOh well you feel like you don\u2019t deserve to be loved, so that\u2019s why you\u2019re alone.\u201d No. No no no no. I\u2019m so sick of reading this. Undoubtedly it\u2019s true for some, but for me this does not resonate. I *did* hate myself for probably the first 25 years of my life. But that\u2019s no longer the case (after much therapy and support group work) and at this point I do love myself. I\u2019m very aware of my flaws, but I know they don\u2019t make me unloveable. But just because I feel loveable does not mean that people suddenly love me. That\u2019s a bullshit narrative that I am sick of hearing, not only because it\u2019s not true, but because it places the blame on YOU. \u201cWell yeah others would love you but they can\u2019t because YOU don\u2019t love yourself.\u201d If anyone reading this came from an abusive family, which I have a feeling many of you have, you know this isn\u2019t true. Your family didn\u2019t NOT love you because you didn\u2019t love yourself. That was their shit, not some unconscious belief around your lovability that you had as a baby. Children inherently feel lovable and are only taught otherwise by the people around them who mistreat them. So that \u201clow self-worth\u201d narrative literally does not hold up to 30 seconds of scrutiny. \n\nI\u2019m also frustrated by it because it overlooks the fact that, for any multitude of reasons, some of us are genuinely more difficult to love. While I am aware of some of my inherent disagreeability, people that I care about often leave me or get angry with me even when I\u2019m behaving as well as I possibly can with them. Even when I\u2019m doing my best to be open, communicative, loving, and respectful, this happens to me. (And this happens to everyone to some extent I think. Loving yourself does not, I repeat, does not mean others will magically love you, too.)\n\nAnd so when I Google these terms, what I\u2019m looking for is somebody who shares my experience. That\u2019s also why am posting this here. If you hate yourself and that\u2019s why you feel lonely, then this post probably isn\u2019t for you. But if you also feel the way I feel for the love of God please say something because according to pop psychology websites, people like me supposedly don\u2019t exist, or we\u2019re patronized and told that we must just subconsciously believe we don\u2019t deserve love. Bollocks. This is also why I find self-improvement talk frustrating at this point in my life. It focuses solely on the psychology of the individual, completely ignoring that the majority of our lives are determined by external circumstances, not by our thought patterns. Annoying.\n\n/end rant", "subreddit": "lonely"}

I am able to love other people as it is the same to breathe,i am able to love myself subconsciously but it is hard for people to love me, it\u2019s hard maybe cause i put myself out of reach,i don\u2019t allow people to understand me. i don\u2019t think or act how the majority does i always say i think i\u2019m before myself,i feel stuck like i\u2019m in the wrong place all the time. The way i love is first through affirmation,i\u2019m too loyal to  disloyalty this is my biggest mistake. Then it is the semi attachment obtained from hours upon hours of endless talking and conversation in one time because one doesn\u2019t simply do this because they are bored it because it means something? incorrect this is my second mistake people are unpredictable,sly and manipulative characteristics someone like me fails to see as i only see the best in people even if it means i have to invent it myself. People can pretend for the fun of it or to gain something out of it. this i know all to well because when loving or feeling i have always been put in the same position different exterior same interior, each boy with a different look each with the same intent and goal. For there has never been one boy who has kept me and solely me in their heart,i have never been anything but 2nd best. I am nothing more than someone to pass the time with until something better comes along, this has broken my heart too many times for me to feel,i will admit i don\u2019t feel love because why would you when it only proves to be destructive why would you want to feel that so i turned that feeling off believe it or not. i stopped falling for words,i stopped falling for actions. i stopped falling. Instead i followed, i followed back on the words i followed the actions i reciprocated in a way as to keep up appearances. i saw the wolf dressing up in the sheep\u2019s outfit and i did nothing but go along with it\u2019s actions until the day it would decide to undress. because all wolfs get tired of sheep\u2019s clothing especially when they meet something else. It was just a case of seeing who could hold out the longest my mask or my feelings. When the wolf begun to start undressing which didn\u2019t take long it didn\u2019t hurt i didn\u2019t feel anything but anger,angry that a wolf could think they deceived me a wolf running and screaming to the mountains it deceived me when it was not me  that was deceived but the wolf, i let you think you had me and that you played when it was me that was going off on you,laughing at the things you would say,rolling my eyes. not even slightly amazed at the actions you put together. i over analyse and create patterns that aren\u2019t apparent i do this and go off this. I wish i hadn\u2019t been broken so much times,the more you break something the more and more it fails to work as it did,i fear loneliness because that\u2019s what this does to me the fear of not being able to trust,not being able to feel,how can you form a connection with someone you can\u2019t feel for or can\u2019t trust because at all costs you cannot afford to get broken again because you cannot guarantee to yourself that you will still function, what an upsetting cycle it is for someone who longs to be loved that can never be loved. Someone who cannot have a guard up as every person is \u2018different\u2019 and will offer something new and the bombardments of what if. what if this one is the one i mustn\u2019t shut him out in fear he will only look else where. This is how i love and can never be loved. His words echo in my mind. \u201cThere is no one for you \u201c it repeats in a dead tone in the front of my mind. \u201cthere is no one for\u201d a destroying sentence in itself, there is not a single person in the world in the great mass of people not one person will be compatible for me, this isn\u2019t a stranger saying this to me it is at the time my boyfriend whom i\u2019ve loved for 3 years and been with for a year the boy who told me he wanted a future with me is the same boy who told me no one is compatible for me. not even himself and this wasn\u2019t said in a way as i am so superior nobody deserves my love or can even level me it was said in a way that i should spend the rest of my life alone because i do not deserve to love anybody. this was said with nothing but malice and anger. i don\u2019t trust words or actions so how do you plan to prove you love me for real and how do you expect me to fall for you", "subreddit": "lonely"}

I was sincerely attracted to her, she was smart and kept up with world issues, was receptive to my sense of humor, liked some good music...\n\nApparently, she *was* too good to be true. We had a nice first date, talked a bit after, but she got cagey when I proposed a second date and I dropped it. Shortly after, she started dating another guy. A little after that, I deleted her from Facebook when her lovey-dovey posts about him made me depressed. And just now, I looked at her Facebook out of morbid curiosity and saw that she's engaged to that same guy.\n\nThere was a time when it would have seriously devastated me. Around mid-2018, when my FA-related depression was at its peak, I had a lot of dreams about her. Dreams where we'd serendipitously run into each other and reconnect. Or where I'd go to meet her somewhere and she wouldn't show up. Either way, they would fuck me up for the rest of the day and make me lament the involuntary nature of dreams.\n\nBut I haven't had those dreams for a while. I haven't really thought of her *as a person* for a while. She still crosses my mind (as evidenced by me looking her up), but it's in a more theoretical context. More of a curiosity, along the lines of \"Why did she show the slightest bit of interest in me in the first place? Can I replicate it somehow?\"\n\nIt still stings, definitely. But if I can take some silver lining from it: she's the same age as me and he's a few years older. It kinda makes me think of the XKCD comic about how the \"half plus seven\" rule increases your dating pool as you get older (even if I doubt that this guy ever had serious dating problems).\n\nSo I'm going to continue banging my head against the wall: exercising, making wardrobe adjustments, trying to take good photos for dating apps, going to bars, trying to find local meetup groups relevant to my interests. Because even if I never achieve what I want, I'd rather know that I tried everything in my power than wonder if I could've done more.

{"post_id": "dcgr2f", "created_utc": 1570051195, "title": "The church of self improvement is a false God + a bit of a rant", "author": "RaverNeko", "self_text": "Over the past couple of weeks I've been thinking a lot about my FA status and beginning to get really frustrated in a lot of areas of my life as a result.  I'm writing this partially to just get my thoughts out there but also for some feedback from others in a similar situation.\n\nI'll start off by expanding upon a comment I made in another thread that was posted here today.  It seems that Reddit is the main preacher when it comes to \"self improvement.\" I've been on Reddit for years and even since the very beginning people people have said that you *always* must strive to be a better version of yourself.  I never understood the whole logic of self improvement being \"just for yourself.\" Sure, on a surface level the \"self-\" part would make anyone believe that it's truly exclusively supposed to be for the self, but that couldn't be further from the truth.\n\nWe as humans have lived in nomadic hunter-gatherer societies for much **MUCH** longer than we have ever been in any type of civilization and as such we are still bound in many ways to our more primitive caveman instincts and in many ways I think this screws with us living in a modern society.  Humans are social creatures.  For thousands of years we were in tight knit communities of around a hundred people and they were absolutely necessary for our survival.  Without others, we would have died alone and I don't mean in a relationship/reproductive sense.\n\nSo when people do \"self-improvement\" whether you like it or not, there is always some aspect of it that's done to impress/please others!  (as a guy) When you work out, you get mired by guys and (maybe) girls, giving you a boost of confidence!  If you were subsequently shamed for your choice to work out, your confidence gained from it wouldn't be nearly as much and you may just end up giving up.\n\nSome people will look at that and say \"well you weren't doing it for yourself, you were doing it for others and that's wrong.\" But I truly believe that no matter what someone may say, deep in a subconscious level they do it for the approval of others.  We wouldn't have jumped into the self improvement treadmill if there wasn't something \"wrong\" with us that we \"needed to fix.\"  There are plenty of normies who don't do any kind of \"self improvement\" stuff except (maybe) exercise every once in a while and they are successful in the dating realm.\n\nThis is what's upsetting me a lot.  Why are we subjected to the endless cycle of self improvement while there are others out there who are subjectively worse off than us and yet have no issues with dating.  There are plenty of stories on this subreddit from people who moved out from their parents, got an education, got fit and in shape at the gym, started going out more often and still are as unsuccessful in the dating world as they were before they took their first steps on the false path of self improvement.  Normies and others often get into relationships via sheer luck and chance no matter what position they were in their lives (a \"improved\" version of themselves or the baseline regular version of themselves, the end result of getting a relationship \"by chance\" is exactly the same for them).  I believe people just think they're better than they actually are.  That it was their \"personality\" or \"hard work\" that got them to where they were (in a happy successful relationship) when it was more of a matter of being in the right place at the right time.\n\nOther people will therefore say \"You are in a better position now than you were before your self improvement, so you should just be happy and comfortable with yourself.\" I believe on a fundamental level that it is truly impossible to be happy without having some kind of experience in an intimate relationship.  Sex/relationships is a need that's classified on Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs and without those pieces to the puzzle you can never obtain full self actualization.\n\nA good quote I found on this subreddit explains this better than I could, \"For years mental health professionals taught people that they could be psychologically healthy without social support, that \u201cunless you love yourself, no one else will love you.\" These ideas contradict the fundamental biology of human beings: we are social mammals and never could have survived without deeply interdependent and interconnected human contact.  **The truth is, you cannot love yourself unless you have been loved and are loved. The capacity to love cannot be built in isolation.**\"\n\nNow I'm not saying that you should **NEVER** work on yourself.  I just believe that it's better maybe to have lower standards that are easily satisfied than high standards and never happy.\n\nIf you made it to the end, thanks for reading.  I'd love to have my ideas on self improvement challenged because frankly no matter what I seem to do it's like a hamster in a wheel spinning away not going anywhere.", "subreddit": "ForeverAlone"}

I just wanted to get a quick vent off my chest, I don't know if anyone will read this or not, but it'll feel good to just get something out that isn't an entry in my notebook. \n\nI (23M) am not a complete loner. I have a couple good friends actually, but even in a group of people, I feel alone. I'm not anyone's best friend, or even really a true part of any group I hang out with, I always feel like a \"third wheel friend\"if that makes sense. I consider my friends to be friends, but they're not people like me. \n\nI guess now would be a good time to describe myself a little. I'm somewhat of an introvert, but I like to be out. I spend a lot of my free time at the bookstore, the movies, and when it's warm out, exploring my city through walking around and finding new places to eat/drink. I dress very nicely compared to most people my age (or really just in general), I'm always in a collared shirt, normally slacks or chinos, and usually penny loafers or more casual leather dress shoes (wingtips, split toes). I don't dress to impress others or girls, it makes me feel good and confident about myself. Even if I'm spending a day by myself, I like to look nice for myself. I would say I spend a good amount of time out by myself, I try to not be cooked up in the house too much.\n\nOne thing is it's very hard to find like minded individuals in my  geographical location. I don't mind going out to bars or clubs on the weekend, but that's not what I want to do EVERY weekend like many people my age. I'd rather go to a quieter spot to grab a drink and bite to eat. When I suggest this to friends, they usually protest and prefer the same old same old. One thing I'd like to start doing but haven't is, I'd like to go to o some local plays/shows, poetry slams and things of that nature. My reason not to is I don't want to be alone in a room full of people who are all with someone else. I should probably take the jump and just go, but situations that like make me feel really low, being surrounded by people who are not lonely. \n\nThis probably goes with out saying, but I am single. I haven't ever really had a REAL relationship before, just the \"relationships\" in high school that ended within weeks. I do believe there is a woman for me out there for me, but I've grown frustrated of not having a girlfriend for so long. I've obsessed with the idea of just having someone to hold hands with and talk to, or show someone the amazing and fun things in life that make me smile. I don't necessarily feel too jealous of other couples because a majority of women in my area really aren't my type.\n\nI've come to the conclusion that eventually I need to take the jump and move somewhere else. Maybe there's somewhere with more people like me, where it'll be easier to build healthy relationships. But in the back of my head, I always feel like I'll be the single, third wheel friend. \n\nIf you've taken the time to read this, thank you, it's nice to be heard and know that there are others out there who feel the same.", "subreddit": "lonely"}

I knew she'd fuck something up if I taught her how to use \"wine\", so I brushed that off. Either way, her basic, reduced digital competence is NOT a thing for me... \n\nIt took me whole months to finally say goodbye to her, slowly removing her from my social media... I can't believe I started cutting myself again and becoming depressed because of such a dumb bitch. Love sucks. I made a post on new years saying I should filter the people I keep in my life as fast as possible, I guess I should follow my own advice!\n\nFor the time being I've given up on dating and it feels so good to know I won't miss her. It took me so long to get rid of her because I always thought to myself, \"but I'm gonna miss her for the rest of my life and I'll feel very bad!\" No more. I don't care about what you drew for me anymore. I can do it by myself now. Fuck off alex! agahgahahahahahaba", "subreddit": "lonely"}

It just helps to see other people struggling with loneliness, it makes me feel less alone with my emotions. The past few months were pretty good, but I've gone through an experience that I just need to talk about because it keeps rattling around in my head. I have a close friend who I've confided in with all of my issues concerning loneliness and isolation. He's the only person who really knows how deep it all goes. Last weekend we went and saw a concert out of town. We went with a couple of his friends and we were having a really good weekend. I drove my car all the way there, on the way back from the concert (which was amazing) my car broke down in the middle of one of the least populated cities in the world. I found a mechanic and they said it would be fixed in the morning. My friend turned to me and told me that he would stay with me that night (the others got a ride from one of their parents who was going to drive up that night). I turned and spoke with the mechanic and when I turned around he was talking with the others about going with them. I asked him if he was going to be leaving with them that night and he said \"yes, I'm sorry\". They left me alone in this town for a night. It really stirred up all of my anxiety and depression surrounding loneliness and isolation. He called me when they got home about six hours later and I asked him why he would say that and then turn around, and he said \"I don't regret my decision.\" Two nights later (I made it home safe) I confronted him and he was super apologetic and bought me a meal and spent the majority of the evening with me. It was nice. The problem is that I feel all of the residual anxiety around the situation, I feel like I can't trust the one person who I put so much trust into. I feel like even though I try my best to be there for people and to be a good person, they all leave as soon as things get rocky. I just have so many emotions and I don't want to be controlled by the anxiety that I have concerning loneliness and I don't want to lose my friend. I just don't know what to do. I feel like if I bring it up again then it would come across as flogging a topic or trying to guilt trip him.

How can I care about finding a hobby when in the back of my head I know I'm just doing it to have something to pretend to give a shit about thats not sex,\n\nDo they not realize how deeply ingrained this need is in us? And yet the deeper we need it the more repulsed they get? And some of us hate fakeness so the thought of being a fake \"me\" to get into someone pants sickens me...but I can't be the real me because for some reason its disgusting and unattractive I have this desire for physical intimacy....\n\nMy depression sometimes turns into anger and frustration and I'm sorry for the rant but this is one of those times.", "subreddit": "ForeverAlone"}

this thread.\n\nIt all started back in 2018 my friend group was small with only L, B, M, and myself.\n\nL had passed his driving test and got a car, at first it was fun and then it got to a stage where, he would just come round and basically beg for people to go out, even when I said no, he still did till I caved.\n\nWell, come April of that year, my little sister turned 18, and we both went out drinking, I brought my friends and we all had fun, my sister and I went home early and my friends and B\u2019s sister (Let\u2019s just call BS) went to a local club, I don\u2019t know the story but BS seemed to hate M after that night, soon after L and BS would be going out, not dating just going places together, one day we had all agreed to go to a forest (They believed it was haunted and it was M\u2019s idea) well L pulls up outside my house and I get in, I notice that M is missing, only L, B and Bs are there, I didn\u2019t say anything as I hate causing a scene, later we went to McDonalds and all three of them started saying how they found M to be a ponce as he didn\u2019t have a job but neither did I, and L would constantly say about it, I did not tell M what they said.\n\nSoon came L\u2019s 20th birthday and he invited B, BS and myself out, BS went home after a short walk around town, L had left B and me alone while he went to dinner with his family, (B had no way of getting home without L) so we waited for him for over an hour, after L insisted we go to pizza hut as it was a tradition for him to go on his birthday, all three of us go, but he didn\u2019t want M to come.\n\nSome time later M had rejoin the group\n\nMy 21st birthday was coming up and the week before L had asked me out but I said \u201c no thanks, I\u2019m saving my money for a birthday night out\u201d\n\nAbout two days before my 21st I asked L, B and M to come out for that Saturday, L and M came but B had work all night, I was asked by L what we where doing out at the pub, So I said how it\u2019s my 21st and I wanted to have a night out, both of them just sat there till the table next to us said happy birthday to me, and then L said how he wanted to go home and watch a UFC match and M needed to go as L was his only way home, needles to say I went to a local beach and just sat there that night.\n\nsoon even more people joined (R, C, J, K, WC)\n\nImmediately liked C as she and I got on well and she started to tell me about an abusive relationship she had just gotten out of (I was a shoulder to cry on) she even gave me my first kiss, but she liked R, but R was sleeping with J (They where FWB) some time later I asked C out and she said no, but then she started to like K, it made me have many mental breakdowns in one week as she would ask me to go out drinking with her just to blow me off and hang out with K.\n\nSoon she friendzoned both R and K as J had slept with them both while they were leading her on.\n\nNow I didn\u2019t like J from the start, as she was a controlling person, so one night I was drunk with WC and he dared me to start on her, over snapchat, as she was abusing him that night over snapchat, but before I did, L had added her to a snapchat group that only, L, B, M, myself and two others were apart of, J started on a girl in the chat (H) and I just said how I hated J\u2019s guts.\n\n(BTW she was also going to hit me the night we met as I was trying to hit it on with C and C didn\u2019t like it, she never said, I got told by M, C told J, I had stopped and was just sitting in the club almost passed out she took me outside and said how she would hit me or get the bouncer to throw me out)\n\nAbout a week later she confronted me about it, after telling everyone she was going to hit me, we both apologised to each other.\n\nSoon it seemed I was being moved out of the group, I said let\u2019s all go to the local arcades one Saturday but the only one to answer was L who said he was going on a date with H\u2019s best friend, but the friday before L had taken most of the group (C, R, CW, and J) to the arcade, when I talked about it, he just said I don\u2019t remember you asking.\n\nIn the group chat someone asked if everyone had jobs, L said, no, M and H don\u2019t.\n\nI have a volunteer job as I have many medical conditions stopping me from working and L knew that.\n\nSo I had enough I blocked L on Snapchat and left any group we were both in.\n\nThe only ones that talked to me where M, C and CW but that didn\u2019t last long, as M had been slowly pushed out of the group at the same time, C didn\u2019t like J and CW was playing both sides, soon C and CW dated but that only lasted two days as CW said \u201cIt was pulling the group apart\u201d so this little group of me, M and C was all I had, but C started to bring R along to our games of pool and soon they dated and just stopped talking to me, I told M everthing that L and B had said over the year about him but he seems to have forgiven them.\n\nNow I\u2019m alone with my 22nd coming in a few days and starting to feel low again, the only one I\u2019ve had contact with, is B who wants the old group back together, but I told me everything that happened after my 21st birthday as he left the group to focus on work for a long time, and how I even tried to kill myself a few times but could not bring myself to do it.\n\nI guess I\u2019m only writting this to see if anyone can tell me what I\u2019m meant to do, as I have no friends left, no job and life looks dark ahead.", "subreddit": "ForeverAlone"}

When I sit down at the dinner table in my silent, empty house and eat my bread of tears, I think of their happy faces and feel a little warmer inside. And if I know they're not happy, trying to be there for them and cheer them up gives me at least a purpose.\n\nI don't know why I'm posting this. I've been having these thoughts a lot lately, and I have nobody to talk about all this to. I guess I just needed to get it out. If anyone actually read through this, thank you so much. :)", "subreddit": "lonely"}

I\u2019m a 15(F), who\u2019s currently a sophomore in high school. I\u2019ve been through a lot though. My dad used to beat me, my former best friend, and my first ever crush, completely cut off all ties with me when I told him about my depression, my friend I met freshman year faked being on drugs to scare me (I almost call the police), and yesterday, I got rejected by my crush. I tried asking around if I should just take the jump and ask him out, and a bunch of guys said that if they were asked out by a girl, it\u2019d make them super happy. So I did, but he said he wanted to focus on his studies. There\u2019s a little piece of me that hopes that maybe we might be able to try something out over winter break or summer vacation, but I know that I don\u2019t think I\u2019m ever going to truly be happy. It just feels like every time I open myself up, I just get hurt again by the people that I trusted. I never really felt loved by a guy in my life, I always felt they were lying, like it was forced, because even though they said it, they never really showed it. So I guess that\u2019s why I want a boyfriend so bad. I just want to beep validated, to feel loved, to feel like it was just luck and that there\u2019s not actually something wrong with me. I just feel like I\u2019m not good enough, I\u2019m worthless, that this is what I get for existing. My dream is just to be a mom and start a family, take care of my kids, try my absolute best to take care of my husband\u2019s needs, and just have a happy family of my own. I just feel lost. I just want a guy to tell me everything is going to be okay, that he loves me and that I am worth it. But every time I turn my head, no one is there. It\u2019s just me.  I know, I\u2019m only 15, I have my entire life ahead of me, but, so many things have happened to me in such little time that it all just feels repetitive, hopeless, and just idiotic to continue on with doing. I don\u2019t know what to do anymore. At this point I\u2019ll take anyone. I just want to escape this living hell that consumes me.", "subreddit": "lonely"}

I don't really know what subreddit that would really fit in so I hope this one is okay. I just wanted somewhere to talk about it and see if others felt the same way as I did. \n\nI am 23 years old and am currently in school working towards getting my Masters in social work which I should graduate with next May. I commute to school which is about an hour away from where I live and I still live with my parents. I don't mind living with my parents and enjoy their company most of the time, but sometimes I can't help feeling like somewhat of a loser about it. I see on social media people that are my age and that I went to high school with who are already moved out and getting married and stuff. A friend of mine recently just got a job in DC and moved to an entirely new state and I'm really happy for her, but it makes me think about me and about how I've lived in the same town in the same house my entire life. I'm not close to doing anything like that and I don't know when I'll be ready for that. \n\nI also don't really have that many friends. I've never really been a popular person, but the few friends I do have I consider them to be really good friends. Like I hangout with my best friend all the time and we've known each other since we were freshmen in high school. With that being said, since I don't have tons of friends I spend most of my time at home. Personally I don't mind that. I love spending time by myself and I don't see anything wrong with it, but I feel like society makes it seem like if you aren't out partying or spending time with a bunch of people you're a nobody. Even if I enjoy spending time alone sometimes I'll be sitting in my room wishing that I was doing more, you know?\n\nI also feel like I don't really enjoy the typical stuff and 23 year old should enjoy, like going to bars and stuff like that. I absolutely hate going to bars. They're too loud and there's too many people and I just get a lot of anxiety every time I'm in one. I also would like to date and have tried online dating, but genuinely get a lot of anxiety about dating, too. I don't really mind being single, but for some reason other people in my life keep pressuring me to date and making me feel bad about the fact that I'm not dating and not trying to date. \n\nI just feel like I'm simultaneously super busy and doing a lot, but at the same time I'm just not doing enough. I know it mostly stems from me comparing my life to others which I know I shouldn't do. I know people only post the good stuff in their lives on social media and I shouldn't compare myself to that because everyone is at their own stage in life. This was basically a long way for me to ask, do others feel the same way at all?? Sorry for such a long post lmao", "subreddit": "lonely"}

I moved away from my friends, my family, my girlfriend, and the only region of the country I called home (southern US coast). I\u2019m in a new place (New England) with a new climate that gets very dark and cold. My seasonal depression has hit me harder than ever. My coworkers are all in the 40s, and of the 2 friends I have, one is moving away the other is busy with a new relationship. \nRecently I\u2019ve been contemplating my relationship. I love her (F23) and we\u2019ve been together since high school. But I realized that I\u2019ve been making the majority of the sacrifices and big trips from one end of the coast to the other, to see her. She\u2019s in graduate school now and in the military and I understand that she is incredibly busy, as am I with work. But in her free time and on big weekends I have to go see her or I don\u2019t get to, or she prefers to make plans and be with her new friends. I love that she has friends and can hang out with them, but after all this time I feel like a second choice. I love her, and I know she loves me. But I don\u2019t feel like I can talk to her about this because she\u2019ll break down emotionally and make it about her. \nMy family is also complicated. I\u2019m the black sheep. I act, look, and operate differently than any of them and My body structure even came out of nowhere. My parents divorced when I was 13 and I bore the brunt of it so my siblings (all younger than me) wouldn\u2019t have to. Now both parents think I took the others side and it wrecked my relationships with them. My siblings don\u2019t really speak to me that often and I\u2019m usually the last one to know about anything going on. They all think I\u2019m sappy or over emotional when I tell them I love them or miss them.\nI have lots of really good friends. It\u2019s not hard for me to make deep, long lasting friendships, but we\u2019re spread all over the place working or in the military. Sometimes the closer ones will get together and seeing them all on social media makes me happy, but it just floods my head with memories and reminds me of how much I miss them and how I\u2019m never getting that back. We keep in touch, but texting falls off sometimes and it\u2019s hard to schedule times around all of our busy schedules to call or FaceTime. \nI\u2019m not sure what to do about any of this, or if it\u2019s all in my head. I\u2019m sure I\u2019ll figure it out.\nJust needed to get this off my chest. Sorry for the long post. \nThanks", "subreddit": "lonely"}

My other two roommates have established a great friendship and hang out frequently and just never invite me. We have never had any conflict and I genuinely don't think they dislike me. But they also don't seem to like me enough to hang out with me. It really hurts my feelings to open their Instagram stories and see them hanging out together. Like right now, I can hear them making plans to go downtown for some drinks and meet with roommate A's friends. I then heard roommate B say \"Is roommate C \\[me\\] home?\" and the other say, \"Yeah, I think so\" without any particular tone of voice. I was hoping this would be the one time one of them would knock on my door and invite me to go out with them, but no. \n\nI've had a really hard time making friends since I moved to this new city one year ago and I really don't know what to do. I can't confront them and be like \"I want you guys to invite me to do things\" without sounding like a whiney sibling. I have invited them to hang out several times but they always manage to turn it down for one reason or another.

Because it seems to me that Asperger's is the perfect recipe for making a guy Forever Alone. Not only is it much harder to meet people if you struggle with social interaction, but you're also at a contradiction with the traits that women find attractive. As a general rule women are attracted to personality traits such as confidence, charisma, assertiveness and some level of social dominance (or at the very least not being a subordinate pushover). The typical guy with Asperger's, who struggles to understand many of the basics of social interaction, probably didn't have many male friends growing up to learn from and has probably been excluded and/or bullied his entire life is rather unlikely to have those traits. Add in the fact that we're more likely to have obsessive, so-called \"nerdy\" hobbies, we might have more of a restrictive and less fashionable dress sense and often struggle to get and keep jobs, that also doesn't help. In fact, [this study](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0087961) showed than men with Asperger's showed fewer masculine personality traits (like those I listed above) than not only Neurotypical men, but Neurotypical women too.

I don't feel comfortable around people I don't know and do not enjoy  social gatherings such as parties or having beers in a pub with mostly unknown people, which limits my possibilities for interaction and new connections by a good amount.\n\nYet, I consider myself to be social; I long for having few people similar to me in my life, with which to share experiences and common hobbys. Knowing that it is very unlikely for me to start a meaningful relationship due to contingencies (living abroad, moving who-knows-where in less than year ect.) and to my character, I feel anxious and pretty desperate at times. The thought of growing old alone terrifies and paralizes me. Seeing that most of the people around me are getting married ect. and experiencing the social distinction of being \"the single one\" does not help.\n\nI just wanted to let it out, today is one of those blue days :/ Does anyone have similar feelings and how do you overcome them?", "subreddit": "lonely"}

The classmates and teachers I have spent the last 4 years of my life with are all so far away now and are no longer part of my life. \n\nThat school was like a sanctuary for me, it was a place where I felt safe and loved and respected and I was very happy. I've already lost touch with most of my friends from there, except for one who is always there for me and I'm always there for her. I'm so grateful that I have her in my life, but she lives far away from me so I don't see her much anymore. But at least I have her to talk to when I need someone. \n\nIn my neighbourhood, I used to have a group of kids who I pretty much grew up with. Every Friday night we would get together and play games/watch movies together. The memories I have with them are literally some of the best memories I have. Unfortunately, most of them are in university now so I don't see them much anymore. One of them recently moved to live in residence in university, and the Friday night thing has kind of stopped. I'm grateful that I grew up with that community around me, but I miss it a lot. \n\nWhen I go to school, I don't talk to anyone. I've always been a fairly quiet person unless you actually try to get to know me. I wish someone would do that at school, but they don't. It's the weirdest thing it's like I really really want to be noticed but at the same time I get so uncomfortable when people pay attention to me. Also everyone in my grade has known each other since the beginning of high school. It's kind of like I'm living in a bubble. \n\nI really really wish that I could just be myself, because I think I'm a likeable and fun person to be around. It's just that when I meet new people, I don't talk to them. I don't talk at all. The most I do is smile or laugh in reaction to what they say. I know from experience that if I don't put myself out there and talk to these people and try to get to know them, I will stay in this bubble until high school is over. Unfortunately that's probably going to happen. I just wish I could be myself.\n\nI've also been thinking a lot about how after high school, there will only be more changes like this one. Basically I'm just stuck longing for the past. And I'm terrified for what's to come. \n\nI'm grateful that I have a loving family and a home to live in and I get to go to school and learn.

I get mad only because they were the ones to walk away while I was wanting to see them more, etc. A guy wanted to get blown by me while he had been seeing a coworker and now are dating. I called him out that I felt very connected and feel like it is disrespectful that he didn\u2019t let me know he was seeing someone else. A friend let me know. Then it hit me last night that I haven\u2019t really seen a guy actually make an effort to see me often. It has always been me that goes out of my way to listen and be there for my few friends but it\u2019s not been reciprocated for romantic relationships.

People I met who used tinder are legit all the same way and for whatever reason don\u2019t want a girlfriend but get one like a week or month later is honestly making me so confused and hesitant. I have been working on my body too to change my appearance and currently, a boy told me I was too fat to date made me really insecure about how others see me, and I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s just the people that\u2019s the issue or if it is me. I started to have jealousy show up when a guy friend I was seeing but eventually said it is the best to just be friends lost his virginity not long ago. I thought he was cool but kind of immature and surprised he has a girl now. This shit is messing with my mind so I\u2019m gonna try to stop using tinder lol. Just needed to vent.

{"post_id": "ddvw8z", "created_utc": 1570321349, "title": "Lonely and isolated expat", "author": "FatherWeebles", "self_text": "Hi all,\n\nFor most of my life I've been a loner.  I can build rapport easily but I don't necessarily seek it out.  I was content with seeing my family every Sunday while I lived in a major city center by myself.  I traveled all around my home country by myself.  I saw myself as being more resilient than most. \n\nThen I moved abroad for school over 2 years ago to a major city in Europe.  It was my second time going abroad for school; previously I lived in another country for about 5 months and did fine.  Anyway, the first year was good - had temporary studio, decent grades, etc.  In the second year I met my now girlfriend, who's from the new country.  The problem is, the housing supply in the new country sucks so bad, especially for students, so I ended up having to move out of the studio and into what I could find, which turned out to be a bad roommate situation at a new house.  Nearing the end of the second year, I was desperate to find a new place I could call my own.  I found a place in a far off, bedroom community type of city.  The studio is the size of a one car garage (literally).  I began living here on September 1st.  Basically, I moved away from my university, a big city, my friends (save 1) and my girlfriend.  That's when problems started.  \n\nIn the previous month of August, I spent about two weeks with my family in my home country, and then they followed me back to Europe for about 2 weeks.  Them leaving and then having to start a new life in a new city kind of wrecked me.  But!  I had a certification exam to pass, so that kept my mind off of my living situation once I got settled.  I passed that certification exam two Wednesdays ago and things have taken a turn for the worst.\n\nI feel like I'm wasting away, and it's started to eat away at my mental health.  It's almost like all of the culture shock from the 2+ years of living in the new country was distilled into a week and a half.  I go to the gym a few days a week and try to eat healthy to keep my spirits high but that's not enough.  My parents are okay with moving back in with them for a few months until classes start up again.  But that would mean running away from the problem and putting the relationship with my girlfriend in jeopardy.  But I also don't want to fall into depression by staying here.  It feels almost like a lose-lose right now. \n\n***More details about the current situation:***\n\n1) The small size of my accommodation is a motivation zapper.  Normally, I have high motivation to always stay productive.  Instead, I'm watching Alien lore on YouTube.  I stare at screens so much now that my eyes hurt.\n\n2) I'm taking no classes until February.  I hope to nail down a thesis topic in the next week or two and start early, but I'm worried about #1 getting in the way.   I could force myself to go to university every day to try to be productive I guess?Normally classes are a way to keep myself occupied with a preset goal.  \n\n3) Landlords use the washing machine room every day.  The washing machine room is on my floor.  I've talked with them about it, and they've mitigated some of the issues involving noise and timing, but not the frequency.  It's definitely better, but still rather annoying and excessive.  This problem went from being a major/moderate problem to a minor one now.\n\n4) The new city kind of sucks.  It's way smaller, and it doesn't even have a stand alone movie theater!\n\n5) My neighborhood is full of young families.\n\n6) My good friend from school and his wife live in this city, which is partly why I moved here.  The thing is, they're so content to be with just one another that I can't seem to hang out with him/them.  They also didn't offer to show me around the city.  Every time I try to schedule something it either gets canceled or other excuses.  Very disappointed.  They might as well not even be here as far as I'm concerned.\n\n7) I see my girlfriend usually once every 2 weeks.  She lives in the larger city and has two kids.  Usually we talk on the phone 5-6 days/week.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Any advice would be appreciated!**", "subreddit": "lonely"}

I thought \"that's okay, we can't hang out all the time, I'm sure they'll invite me when they can.\" They don't. Everyone leaves me on read in the group chat. They don't want to hang out with me unless they're all together. I can't make new friends, I'm in no position to make a whole other friend group *again*.

Have had 1 friend since the first grade.", "author": "IAmHorribleSocially", "self_text": "I had 2 really good friends in Kindergarten. I never saw them afterwards before I went to private school. It took me nearly 2 decades to get another friend. I feel like I'm the only person on the planet to go through elementary school, middle school, high school, and college without a single friend. If a genie would grant me a wish. I would automatically wish to relive life, but always with a real friend. I wouldn't care if I had to relive life in the worst living conditions in the world. I feel like my whole life has been wasted because I'm so lonely. I went to more birthday parties uninvited than invited. I love concerts and and sporting events. Almost every-time I've gone to one, I've gone alone. I was so lonely I sat next to people, who in respect were not my friends. I think they only let me sit next to them because I had no friends.  Even worse at some point, I think some people gave me rides to church not because I was their friend, but because they felt sorry for me.  On my last day of high school I remember crying in the parking lot because everybody else had friends and everybody went home with friends to celebrate the last day of school. I called my dad to pick me up from the middle school because I didn't want to explain to him why I was the only one in the parking lot.  I remember in 2016 I was so desperate for a friend I went to meetup after meetup. It took about 10 meetups where nobody liked me before I finally got a friend. The ironic thing is if I wasn't so desperate. If I quit going to meetups after my 10th pointless one, my friend drought will probably still be going on 25 years later. My friend moved 1.5 years to be with his girlfriend. I remember that for once, I was going to have somebody to hang out with during New Years Eve. Then my friend got a girlfriend. I'm dreading this New Years Eve. I am going to be alone again. The worst part is that I've o close to making friends in the past. I've met people. They liked me. In less than a couple of months, they get bored of me. I feel like the biggest loser ever. How many people can say it took them 2 decades to find a friend, more than 5 to get my drivers licence, 10 years to get a part-time job, and more than 5 years out of college to get my first full-time job? I wish I could live life over again. FYI I drove all they way across country to Sillicon Valley to find a full-time job. I got one at the airport, where I also lived in the terminals for a couple of months to save money. Now I work at a big tech company, get paid well, and lively extremely cheaply with my coworker. I can't believe I was in high school when the labor market collapsed, and it literally took me all the way until the end of the bull-market to get my first full-time job. I don't think anybody's life is more pathetic than mine. I just wished at some point in my life, making a friend wouldn't be so hard. Most people figured out how to do it before they turn 10.

Meanwhile, only 2 out of the 100 I saw a man who was the same height as the woman or shorter. 1 of those 2 it was a average looking man and average looking woman. They were both about the same height. Then the other of those 2 couples it was a very tall man and woman about 6'4 to 6'5 and the woman was about a inch taller than the man.

The reality though is that something is not adding up. This reality is that height is a huge deal to most women and women need to just admit that a guy being shorter than them or short in general is a huge turn off. Key word being most, but not all. I realize this doesn't apply to every woman. I would appreciate the honesty if people would just finally admit it matters instead of saying it doesn't matter. Since the real world out there suggests otherwise based on what I see every single day. Other FA's what do you observe and notice in couples? Clearly something is not adding up.

Just PM me with your username if you want to talk.\n\nBackground:\n\nI've been feeling pretty isolated lately. It's difficult to talk to people because I don't have many of the same interests and desires as most people. Everyone at work or college talks about money, houses, cars, sports, relationships, restaurants, video games, status (in job placement or using school as a means for monetary advancement.) \n\nI mean there's nothing wrong with all that, but none of it interests me so it makes it difficult. I have a hard time joining conversations on stuff I can't talk about, so I'm mostly quiet. When I join in on conversations, I guess it's so unexpected that I get ignored.\n\nI'm really passionate about education and learning. I don't see it as a means to an end, but an end in itself. But whenever I tried to share stuff that interests me, I got playful yawns, but it still hurt my feelings. Even at school in my classes, I can't seem to talk to anyone who shares my same passion for them, everyone I've talked to has the same attitude as get this over with and get me my credits and move on. Like I said, I don't have anything against this. People have different goals, but it feels so isolating not being able to talk to anyone.\n\nEvery time I get asked about having a girlfriend and saying I'm not interested in having one right now they look at me with disbelief. It makes me feel like less of a man just because sometimes the guys at work talk about sexual exploits and I don't want to join in, but they make it feel as damn this guys a loser. I had two relationships once upon a time, the girls were exactly what I had desired at the time, but crazily enough I discovered relationships don't actually fill the void of loneliness.\n\nI've given up my desire to find someone to connect with, but I enjoy talking to people and seeing what makes them tick. I think passion and happiness are infectious.  \n\nSo if anyone would like to talk hit me up (preferably on discord). I'd really like to learn more about you regardless.

It seems like everyone else has a best friend, someone they consider to be their person, but I dont feel like I have that. I\u2019m so replaceable, so unwanted. Everyone always finds someone else. I\u2019m always a second choice. Life as a college freshman isn\u2019t easy. I\u2019ve tried to put myself out there, tried to make friends and it\u2019s working but why do I still feel so incomplete? Why does it still feel like no one even wants me in their life? Maybe it\u2019s just my brain overthinking everything, like when I\u2019m with two other people and one of them doesn\u2019t give me any eye contact when they talk. Or when I say something and people seem to brush it off or completely ignore what I said and talk over me. Maybe I\u2019m just overreacting and am selfish and stupid and needy but everything still hurts. I barely had any friends in high school. I tried so hard to be nice to everyone and look out for people but no one likes me.

I always feel like I\u2019m stepped on and mistreated no matter how hard I try to be nice and caring to everyone. Even if I try my hardest it seems like it goes unrecognized. There\u2019s always someone who people consider to be better than me. And I don\u2019t want to be the best but I just want to be valued and appreciated for what I do the way other people are in their friends\u2019 eyes. I\u2019m so jealous of people who are able to make long-lasting, loyal friends so fast. The kind that want to stick with their group, who uplift each other, and are comfortable with each other. I don\u2019t know why I\u2019m never good enough to have that. I don\u2019t know what I\u2019m doing wrong that it seems like everyone\u2019s against me. I miss being at home so much. When I was in high school I didn\u2019t like it. People constantly bullied me behind my back, telling others that I was dumb or that no one wants me around anyway or whatever. But my family was always my rock and now they\u2019re not here. I feel so disconnected from them too. Even if we talk everyday it feels like their lives are changing and I\u2019m no longer a part of any of it. It\u2019s like everyone\u2019s moved on but me. I don\u2019t know why I always feel like a second choice, never good enough, and so replaceable. For example, I have this one friend and it seems like everyone appreciates her so much. They\u2019re respectful to her and value what she has to say and take her advice but no ones like that with me. Nothing I say ever matters. I\u2019m always just brushed off. I don\u2019t know how I can change myself and be someone that others actually value and care about. thank you for listening... I just needed to get all of that off my chest:(", "subreddit": "lonely"}

Sometimes I just feel that the love is not mutual. I always feel like I'm the least favorite of all of them. I feel like they think I'm a loser, and it just fucking sucks. I wish I could open up to them more emotionally but I just feel like I can't because if I do, they'll think even worse of me. They're all very physical with each other, but I feel like it just isn't the same with me. I don't really ever get touched by any of them. The only touch I really get from them is the occasional weak hug. When we're all together, I can sort of keep up in conversation, but whenever I'm alone with one of them, I feel like it's just kind of awkward. They all call me a best friend but it just does not feel that way. They just don't treat me the same way they treat each other and that hurts. I guess a good way to put it is that I sometimes feel like it wouldn't make that much of a difference to them if I wasn't there. I feel like ultimately I'm not an important figure in their lives. It just sucks because I don't know what to do. I don't want to feel lonely, and I would have thought that the one group of people I could go to were my \"best friends\", but when I'm with them I feel even lonelier somehow. Like an outsider.

{"post_id": "de2006", "created_utc": 1570361005, "title": "I'm 20, university student, depressed, autistic and I completely forgot how to socialize again.", "author": "startrekzooka", "self_text": "As someone diagnosed with Aspergers Syndrome/Autistic Spectrum Disorder since I was 11, I feel like my life at university feels like constant hell, even though I really still remain optimistic about it wanting it to be better and trying to change constantly. I always feel misunderstood and invisible around others, when I really want to try hard to get noticed and loved.\n\nBut I've recently feel like I forgot how to talk to people. Ever since I started uni weeks ago, I'm not sure why but everytime I talk to people who try to seem interested in me, I suddenly blank out and just say little words/casual responses like ''ah yeah'', ''i get you'' or just nod my head, and I feel like it makes the other person seem uninterested in me. I may occasionally offer advice or stuff about myself from time to time, but I can tell if the other person seems uninterested or is just responding for the sake of not making me feel left out before they have to head out. Or sometimes they quickly move on to talk to another person. It all feels superficial and makes me feel like I've become an uninteresting person to talk to.\n\nI try this with literally everyone when I'm going for icebreaker events from different societies I may be interested in at uni, because I know it's better to try than to be isolated all the time. But constantly, I feel like I'm facing rejection and becoming more boring by the day.\n\nIt's like I have nothing interesting to talk about or contribute to a conversation, and it's hard to find people with similar specific interests and then again, it's hard to even talk about my interests without internally criticising my voice or the way I talk or carry the conversation. Or even how I look in general. My short height (5'5'' / 5'6'') may also play a factor.\n\nI constantly feel like everyone avoids me or especially during a mid-convo, and I still long for a group of friends at uni that I can hang out with daily, but I don't have that anymore.\n\nEspecially now that I'm repeating a year of physics at uni and NOBODY STILL WANTS TO BE MY FRIEND OR TALK TO ME unless it's work-related or whatever. I always sit alone in those lecture halls where noone sits beside me unless there's no space. I try to talk to other people beside me before class starts but they seem disinterested or too socially awkward to reply back.\n\nIt's just so hard and it really bruises my ego and mentality a bit, and constantly ruminate on my flaws.\n\n*Do I really look super autistic?*\n\n*Am I not attractive enough?*\n\n*Is my voice weird?*\n\n*Did I say this or that right?*\n\n*Why can't I stop mumbling and speak louder and slower?*\n\nI see everyone having close guy and girl friends and I still struggle to even have a female friend in my course, especially my year. It makes me feel alone, dead and unaccomplished and I can't even focus on my studies without feeling like I'm always alone and depressed all the time.\n\nThis has been happening since mid-september since I started the year. I really do long for love, support or a group of friends and also to come out of my shell and stop feeling so socially reclusive, awkward and shy. I was a bit better at this a year ago. I'm not sure why all of a sudden it's like I have this mental block in my head that hinders me from saying certain stuff or contributing to a convo properly. It's making me feel like I'm missing out on quality friendships and relationships when all I do is small-talk to everyone and make a shit ton of acquantainces.\n\nWish there was a remedy for this because daily I feel like shit, reclusive, depressed and lonely all the time. I'm also still behind on my assignments and study because there's a lot and I need to stop checking social media too much. It really makes me feel depressed and constantly suicidal, because I'm so behind on everything in life and everytime I go out, I see a lot of people I recognize holding hands with their girlfriends...etc.\n\nIt really messes with my sense of entitlement and self too.\n\nI probably shouldn't have wasted all summer in my room on discord/reddit/random forums tbh, otherwise I would've been exposed to new ideas, got a summer job and had more to talk about with people my age. I also should've kept in touch with my old friends because now they're becoming strangers to me now and they've moved on a year, while I'm repeating a year so I won't see them as often.\n\nI think I just want to feel supported, liked by people and not feel misunderstood all the time. I also want to feel normal. I constantly feel misunderstood and it bruises my ego too much. I hate when other people try to feel entitled tbh.\n\nI may be 20 years old but I constantly feel like my mentality dwindles between 14 and 17. I guess this is what happens when I've been spoonfed all my life due to my autism and not being able to handle certain things properly like never learning to tie my shoes until I was like 19. I never learned how to drive, never had a job before, never had a group of friends to hang out with since I was like 16-17 probably. It was far better in my early childhood before I was 9 years old though.\n\nMy parents pay the fees for my uni, so I constantly feel bad about that too.", "subreddit": "ForeverAlone"}

Dating prospects have been rather minimal in spite of trying, and has only gotten worse due to the recent protests this past week, with transport shutdowns and such. The short story is I'm wondering if anyone can relate to feeling they can't find love in their own country, especially as a second-gen immigrant to said country.\n\nThe long story is that I feel its moreso the situation that I'm a local-grown westerner (gwailo) that's the trouble here. Having grown up in an international social bubble, trying to acclimate to a more localized cultural circle is pretty tough. Far fewer English speakers around, and generally less cross-culture mingling and fewer extroverts, and those that do speak English at my school are 99% exchanges who'll leave, and/or people who just wanna drink, smoke, or party just with those who came from the same country, and heading to the west myself to study monetarily isn't doable. Not that I mind completely, it's my homeland here, and I love this place with my heart. Hence my reluctance to leave.\n\nBut the worst part is that I feel maybe, just maybe, I really *am* better off leaving.\n\nNever grew up in Europe, but having visited my ancestral homeland, I feel I'd fit a European/American country more solely due to being a middle-class type who's pretty outgoing and quirky, rather than being amongst only local HK'ers, or much richer tourists and temporary workers/residents. Not that I blame either group, locals often went through some pretty tough shit growing up compared to us expats, who might often seem like stuck up rich types, and the schooling doesn't exactly put English on equal footing to Mandarin Chinese, just as we didn't get high footing on Cantonese. And bearing the current political climate, I have a feeling dating isn't exactly high on the priority list.\n\nFurthermore, permanently resident foreigners at my age (20) are very rare simply due to how affluent we usually are to get here in the first place; we come here, study, and leave for greener pastures, or to simply go back home.\n\nBut that's what bugs me. Amidst all of this, and the political turmoil, I.. don't want those greener pastures anywhere else. Especially if the *only* bloody reason I have to leave *is* to find love.\n\nThe pastures might be greener 'back home'.\n\nBut they're not *home*. They're not the same shade of green.\n\nI want to find someone here who I won't have to drag out of their home, or drag myself with them to theirs. But unless I do that, I'm out of options. I feel I'll be alone here, but homesick there.\n\nI just wonder if there's anyone else who can relate, anyone living in a land they can't find love in, but can't bring themselves to leave, unless they have no choice, which would hurt just as much. And I'll say it first, yes, the easy solution is to transfer and go, but that's not the point here. That still leaves the same issue. Just in case I don't seem aware.", "subreddit": "ForeverAlone"}

People are so anxious to punch down and bully those less fortunate on a social level, they don't understand how maybe they should stop. I've always said, the biggest recruiters the incel forum have are social media and any group dedicated to bullying them. I used to have a blog where I would vent about being FA although I didn't call it FA at the time. I was very lonely and was just writing down my feelings. I would constantly get hate messages telling me to commit suicide for the good of society. The constant hate messages caused me to find a group to belong to.

More specifically, at the part that's called 'lonely'. I am feeling scared, pissed and relived. All at the same time. I don't want to have to find myself here, and it scares the *** out of me that I do. It scares me because I don't know how to make it better. I don't know how to feel connected to the people around me. Because i have people around me. But they just live their lives, growing up and moving on. People who I used to hang out with on a daily or weekly base have found SO's to spend time with. And they should, I don't blame them. But I am left behind, and it keeps hitting me that I am nobody's priority anymore. I was always there for everybody. They were always welcome. And now I am no longer needed. I am redundant, replaced and irrelevant. I do not matter anymore. It makes no difference for anybody whether or not I exist. And that hurts so extremely bad. Feeling completely irrelevant. \n\nAnd it makes me pissed too. Pissed at myself for allowing myself to feel this way and to end up here. Pissed because I have a nice job, a house and a cat. I am healthy (as far as I know), and are my family and 'friends', and I still feel like this. But also pissed at everybody else. Pissed at my friends for not seeing me, while I'm standing right in front of them showing them how much I'm hurting, for not hearing me when I keep trying to tell them over and over. But they are either blind, stupid or simply not interested, because they have their own lives and I don't really matter. My role is so unimportant that nobody notices that I don't like my part and I don't want to play it anymore. I can't. I won't. But I also don't know how to stop it. And that brings me back to being pissed at myself. Because maybe I am not speaking loud enough, even though it's the loudest I can. And I can't blame them for living their lives, getting married and having children. I can't blame them, but I still do. And I blame myself for not being able to do the same thing. Instead I am here, feeling very sorry for myself while I know I am the only one who can fix it. And for some reason I am too weak or stupid to do it. And if that is the case, I don't deserve these friends. They deserve better. \n\nI am also pissed at my mother, for making me this way. I love her but I hate her so intensely at times. She is the reason for me being completely unable to trust or open up. To actually ask for help. I hate her for always being the child, never the parent. For always wanting attention, but never doing anything to fix herself. She should have tried to fix herself, so I would know I can fix myself. And not expect me to fix her, because I can't. I can't fix her, even though I would everything to do so. And I hate her for not being somebody I can talk to. She wants to help, but she is so immature and broken that she can't. Telling her something only results in me having to make her feel better because 'she is so extremely sad and worried about me'. Its easier not to tell. It is better, because then I don't have to deal with my own *** and her worries about my ***. Its just easier. But I wish she was someone I could talk to and she could make me feel better. But instead, I am on this world to make her feel better. Because I have been the adult ever since I was 12. And you don't dump your problems on a child. So I tell her that I'm ok, just tired. And hey, that last part is true. \n\nAlso, I am a little relieved.. relieved that I apparently recognize what my 'problem' is, and that I am writing this down. I never did that before.

Like with most office environments, gossip goes around and comes around. Multiple other guys in the company have worked with K for years, and some know him on a casual friendship level. Maybe they don't hang out beyond work, but they've talked enough about their personal lives to have gossip. \n\nSo I finally worked up the guts to try to fish for a little more info on K from his work buddies, and according to all of them, K is a FA. Which I didn't really believe at first, because I don't understand it. \n\nTo me, K is very cute bordering on hot. K is a little awkward, but I like his sense of humor. It's basically a typical crush. Every other thing K does or says is endearing to me. \n\nThey say he is a virgin despite several years into adulthood, that he has never had even one girlfriend, and that according to K, women are just not ever interested in him. Bullshit! But maybe it's because he has such crippled self-esteem that he believes it? Idk.\n\nBut they all more or less explained that K has given up on dating in general, thinks no women are ever into him, etc.  \n\nBottom line is that I don't know how to navigate showing interest. The normal types of flirting, especially with the social limits of an office environment, don't really seem to be enough. He always acts numb/distracted with everyone, like it's all white noise around him. He didn't notice anything I've tried so far that I can tell.\n\nOn the other hand, it's not like I can acceptably just come right out like, \"Hey K, I think you're hot, want to get high in the park this weekend?\"\n\nIt even seems like the more I try to get to know him in a casual-coworker way, the less he interacts with me at all.

A little over a year ago, a girl I had been dating for about five years cut ties with me. I am still hurt to this day because of it. Shortly after, I moved to rural Missouri for work and quickly fell into depression. I had no friends around me. Felt like I did not fit in. Had trouble making friends. I do not fit in with my coworkers at all. For the past year I have literally done everything alone. I do not complain about it but my family have taken note of it.\n\nMy dad on the phone: really so you're going to go drive there all alone? nobody wanted to come with you?\n\nMe: Its fine dad.\n\nBecause at the end of the day it **was**. Some of the most fun times in the past year I have done completely alone. Few things about doing stuff alone.\n\n* It is not hard to make friends when you are alone.\n\nI have gone to concerts, bars, festivals, you name it alone. And almost **every time**, I strike up a conversation with somebody. I do not consider myself a very outgoing person. But people do not like seeing somebody alone. Went to a festival a month ago alone and camped out and within the first few minutes people were inviting me into their camping area, asking if I wanted to hangout with them, asking who I was most excited to see. Just last night I went to a bar alone, bartender and a women next to me both struck up a conversation with me and I was only there a few minutes.\n\n* It allows you to explore.\n\nI never thought I would be doing half of the stuff I do, nonetheless be alone. I drive into the city, hop from one bar to the next, catch a show, go back to another bar, watch the end of a sports game. Drive home. Most likely, if you were with somebody they would not want to jump around that much. Or want to spend the money. I can plan trips completely accordingly my specifications.\n\n* I cherish times with friends a lot more.\n\nWhen I get breaks from work I travel and meet friends around the country. And we have a great fucking time. I tell them how much they mean to me all the time and tell them I have the best friends in the world. I filter out who my real friends are who carry through with plans or just ignore me. I never thought I could enjoy a 7-hour car ride so much when you have your two best friends to bullshit with. I am planning a trip to see them all next month and I cannot fucking wait. Literally. I am going to take so many photos with them and not drink just so I can enjoy every second.\n\nI can go on and on, but you guys see my point. Its hard to commit to doing something that you will do alone. But I promise you, get out there and go do it. There are people out there waiting to meet. Its not easy. But I am here for you.

Let\u2019s me start from the beginning.\n\nAround the end of 8th grade I met this girl who was a freshman in high school. We hit it off right away. She had a couple diagnosed mental issues (or at least thats what she told me). And two months into the relationship she took my virginity. Our relationship ended in a not so nice way. \n\nBasically she was at party and claimed was raped. Then again she didn\u2019t file a police report and got mad whenever I was going to. I believed her up until I found out there where texts between her and her best friend, it went along the lines of:\n\nEx: \u201cI was really drunk and we went to his car\u201d\nFriend: \u201cWhat happened in the car\u201d\nEx: \u201cWe started making out and then we did some things\u201d\n\nNow my ex claimed she was diagnosed with depression, anxiety, and PTSD. Before she moved to my town she lived with her mother where my ex claimed she was raped so her mother good get money and drugs (all claimed to have happened by my ex). And I have yet to find any police reports about this. Her mother in the ended up dying while she was young (I forgot why, it was probably suicide but I can\u2019t be too sure everything is a little foggy) and that\u2019s how she ended up in my town living with her alcoholic dad (something she claimed). \n\nAnyways, she ended up causing me a lot of mental harm subsequently making me look for outlets like drugs and alcohol. I don\u2019t drink anymore and the last time I did coke and pills was months ago. I\u2019m better now physically. But mentally I\u2019m not. \n\nI haven\u2019t been able to date anyone since this whole thing 3 years ago. My parents don\u2019t believe in therapy so now I\u2019m stuck to smoking weed (which helps immensely whenever I think of self harming again). \n\nI feel so low of myself I don\u2019t know why I feel this way. I feel ugly. I feel stupid. I feel like no one wants me. I get ridiculed by everyone about everything. I don\u2019t feel normal. \n\nMaybe it\u2019s just normal teenage feelings or maybe I do  need help. My ex used to say I needed help a lot. \n\nSorry for this tangent I just needed to vent.

It's wearing on me more and more, of course, and becomes more and more unbearable with every day. While my brain has been getting an idea of what's theoretically normal and what's not throughout my whole life, I could never practically fit in, for some reason. I can never participate in whatever the world has to offer. This fact destroys my life. Interacting with people is an extremely basic thing. So it's as much of an impairment as not being able to read, for example. I know what's right to say or do in a given situation, but when it comes to performing it myself, my brain short-circuits.\n\nNormal people underestimate one thing when talking about life inconveniences and trying to convince me that \"it's not that bad\": time. Even mildly unpleasant things, sustained for extremely long periods of time, can ruin a healthy person and lead them to insanity. All those years of suffering with not even slightest prospect of it coming to an end make me wish to die of an heart attack or something. It became clear to me that \"the character I happened to play as\" is just uncool and won't ever be any worthwhile.

I see an opportunity to finally be part of something interesting, become accepted and appreciated. How greedy of me to crave something so basic, right?

Anyway, this advice propelled me to put on this mask below:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/8f8ukzzxi2r31.png?width=467&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=54a44ab94deea44e685d5cf0eb81f530f8100635\n\nBefore, I would exhibit signs of sadness so some people would ask if I was ok. Because of this, I decided to wear this mask everywhere I go so people wouldn't ask me questions and then tell me to take a shower when they found out I was FA. At work, grocery stores, food stores, gas stations, etc... I always try to produce an aura of friendliness to everyone I meet. Its kind of like a new game for me. Be a happy actor. Its because about a year ago, my mind finally cracked from being FA. For many years, I never cried about being FA, and just never cried in general. But around last year was the first time I cried in a long time. Ever since, I cry at least once a week. Ironically, I am a confident person and am not afraid to stand up to bullies or talk to strangers, but this confidence never resulted in any romantic prospects. \n\nI always thought growing up I would have a normal life and meet some nice girl, but I never did. I am in my late twenties and approaching 30, so it could be over for me soon. The reason I put on this mask is so that the day I kill myself people will be shocked. They would say something like 'This is such shocking news. We never expected doorvob to kill himself. He was such a happy and energetic person'. Putting on this mask is a strange way to cope I do admit, but it is something I will continue doing for now until the day my will to live is diminished.", "subreddit": "ForeverAlone"}

Inside my heart rate was off the charts by I acted confident by maintaining my composure. It was DEFINITELY not my comfort zone.\n\nSo I was told by a cute girl on bumble that I was a smooth talker.  Never had anyone tell me that before.\n\nAlso I went to a bar with my friends last night. Got the snapchat from a girl, had another girl just hand me her phone straight up to put my number in, also had another girl, friend of the snapchat girl add me on Facebook. And all it took was me going up to them, striking up a conversation, ask about their day and stuff.\n\nNow does this mean any of them will actually work out or will I date them? No. But it was a confidence booster that I can do this and if I need to fake it, I gotta do what I gotta do, even if means stepping out of \u201cemotional safety cave\u201d", "subreddit": "ForeverAlone"}

I have felt it. He is inside of her.\n\nHe feels ecstasy.\nHe feels euphoria.\nHe feels\u2026 complete\u2026 eternal\u2026 immortal\nHe loves her more than ever.\n\n\u201cOoh baby, you\u2019re so amazing. I love you. I love you. I love you!\u2019\n\nHe has gone back to his beginnings, to his origins, to the womb.  As Robin Williams once said, a man spends nine months trying to get out and the rest of his life trying to get back in.\n\n\u201cOoh baby, if only I could stay inside of you forever\u2026\u201d\n\nTime and again, he reaches out to her. He seeks the entering, the being inside, the thrusting, the loving, and then\u2026 the moment of climax, when he gives all of himself away.\n\nHow good it feels \u2013 to give it all away.\n\nTo say \u201cf*#k it\u201d with all of his energy, after a whole day of keeping it together.  The ultimate freedom. To release, to let go, to die. The little death, \u201cla petite mort,\u201d as the French say.\n\nAnd as much as he wants to sustain the ecstasy, it all ends in a split second. And often he feels empty afterward \u2014 exhausted, depleted, half dead.\n\nHe no longer wants to stay inside of her forever. He wants out. His member is shot.\n\nHis illusion is dismantled. He knows it\u2019s impossible to stay inside. She cannot make him whole. He feels vacant. Maybe even ashamed of his foolishness.\n\n\u201cTell me again, how much you love me,\u201d she says.\n\n\u201cHuh?\u201d he says.\n\nAnd at that moment, he crashes into reality. He is pulled out of his myopia, the nearsightedness of his own pleasure. He is alerted to the other. And he may even feel like a boy who\u2019s been found out.\nDon\u2019t like ads? Become a supporter and enjoy The Good Men Project ad free\n\n\u201cYou mean, you don\u2019t really love me. You were just pleasuring yourself inside my body.\u201d\n\nAnd sure, there are women who are fine with a man pleasuring himself in her body. But that\u2019s a fling, not a serious long term relationship.\n\nStill, a day or even an hour later, his desire rises again. To be back inside of her. To re-engage the illusion that life and all things will be perfect once he\u2019s back inside of her. And again, the words come out of his mouth.\n\n\u201cAwww baby, I love you! If only\u2026\u201d\n\nHe\u2019s back to where he started. What\u2019s going on here?\n\nWell, he\u2019s been taken away \u2014 worked over by his libido, his testosterone, his desire, or love. It masters him. He is not the master of it. He does not work with his sexual energy, but gets worked by it.\n\nAnd he doesn\u2019t feel the cost of this cycle until he\u2019s in his late twenties and often older. The relational cost to himself and his partner. The cost of eventual\u2026\n\nDisconnection.\nApathy.\nAn inner relational deadness.\nAnd in time, less and less sex, if any at all.\n\nIn the absence of confronting the problem, many men grow bitter. Project, blame, bark. \u201cFrigid Bitch.\u201d\n\nOr they spend years, looking for other women, chasing the same \u201cmake me whole, baby\u201d booty call. Many men eventually just resign themselves to a sexless marriage or relationship.\n\nInstead, a man may answer the call.\n\nThe call to discover what he really seeks in sex \u2013 connection and intimacy \u2013 and how to experience those things, integrated with his sexuality, instead of in lieu of.\n\nThe call to see her vagina as a sacred part of her that enhances intimacy, instead of a vehicle through which to merely pleasure himself.\n\nThe call to master his own sexual energy, instead of something that masters him.\n\nAnd yes, this takes training.\n\nTo challenge the complacent parts of himself.\nTo grow.\nTo become more relational.\nTo get bigger in his capacity as a lover and ally to his partner.\n\nSex alone won\u2019t make him whole.\n\nBut most men won\u2019t do the work until they\u2019re forced to, until their marriage or relationship is near an end.\n\nYes, women\u2019s sexuality is powerful. Super powerful. The Yoni. The Sacred Birth Canal. The source of all life. How can a man not be in awe?\n\nSex in a long term relationship stops for one reason. Because there\u2019s been a kink in the connection between partners.\n\nIt doesn\u2019t just get turned back on magically. It takes work \u2013 speaking hard truths, risking vulnerability, rebuilding trust, and often even risking separation or divorce.\n\nSo, what\u2019s the deal? Am I just wanting to bash men?\n\nHell no. I want to help men, and women, have an energized and fulfilling relationship. And good sex is certainly a part of that.\n\nAnd let\u2019s be clear, women have their part in the dynamic as well. More on that next week.\"", "subreddit": "ForeverAlone"}

She's really pretty: blonde, tall, and thin. She could seriously be a super model. She asked for my number so we could take our online exams together, but I was unable to get together with her the first time because I have a shitty job that requires me to wake up at 3:00 am (I am quitting very soon). I decided, \"fuck it, I'll just get shitty sleep. I need to make sacrifices if I want a romantic life.\" So, I asked her if she wanted to meet up at my house to do our exam. She agreed!\n\nI got so excited. I try hard to not get excited, but it seems to be compulsive. This was going to be my first time having a girl in my house after four years. My house was clean and well-stocked with beer, pot, and snacks. I figured we would finish the exam in about an hour and then I'd ask her if she wanted to smoke. We'd get high and drink a little and just shoot the shit. We\u2019d learn about each other\u2014I even rehearsed my responses; pathetic. Towards the end of the night, I\u2019d make sure she was sober and send her on her way. If things went well, I was going to ask her out on an official date. If we didn't click, well, at least I tried and I'd be proud of myself for that simple fact alone. I didn\u2019t even want to fuck. All I wanted was a fun night with a girl I found attractive.\n\nI\u2019m not mad at her; she did nothing wrong. If I were her, would I want to come over my house? Fuck no. I\u2019m a loser and she could probably see that emanating from me. I\u2019m never going to amount to much of anything. It\u2019s really funny because I\u2019m probably going to never be in another relationship ever again. No girl wants to be with a pathetic fucking loser like me. An ugly waste of fucking space. I really can\u2019t blame her, and I don\u2019t. I get the message\u2014she doesn\u2019t want anything to do with me. I'll leave her alone. She probably asked for my number to be kind. I doubt I\u2019ll ever find love again. I found it once and it was with a psycho who destroyed my reputation and caused me to lose a good amount of my childhood friends. You know what's really sad?

Few questions I have:\n\n- do you think batman's dad really is jokers father? Tbh I think he is. Even if you make the argument that joker and his mom were both mentally ill, the picture you see when joker is going through his mom's stuff shows that she was a confident stacy, compared to the flashback where she seemed out of it and in the current time when she was a meek old lady, and in the back was a note from thomas saying he loves her smile. Not something you'd just tell any ol' 'employee'. I think penny was a normal stacy, but, Thomas got her commited to the mental hospital to get rid of her after getting her pregnant and the trauma from losing Thomas and the mental damage of being sent to a psych ward broke her mentally and that's when she started going crazy and Thomas used his money and influence to forge adoption papers for Thomas to make it seem like she just adopted him. Think about it, it's very difficult to adopt a kid and no way they would let a crazy poor single lady like Penny just adopt a kid.\n\nAlso I've never liked batman. I always felt like he was a jerk. And now I can see that the apple doesn't fall far from the tree. And I have also lost all respect for Alfred because he knew about the affair and dismissed arthur like he was garbage.\n\nThe way Alfred reacted saying \"wait, your Penny's son??\" - 100% Thomas Wayne is his dad. And the way Thomas reacted in the bathroom, \"what do you want then? Money?\" 100% thomas wayne is his dad.\n\n- Do you think he killed the black girl? I can't really tell. He did the gesture with the fingers pulling a trigger to the end and thats the last we see of her. BUT they showed all his other murders so I feel they would have showed her dying too if he killed her right? But then again I can't imagine he just walked out of the room doing nothing...I really don't know about this one.\n\n- Was it not self defense when those rich kids jumped him in the train? Think about it, they were going to kick him to death with nobody there to help Arthur, so him shooting them was 100% self defense right?\n\n\ud83c\udfb5I'll waaaait in this place, where the suuuun never shiiiiines\nWaaaaait in this place, where the sha-dows ruuuun, from themseeeeelves \ud83c\udfb5", "subreddit": "ForeverAlone"}

I went looking on my NAS and in a folder which at the time I couldn't remember I had put there or my wife. I had a shock as I scrolled down and found photos of a naked guy in a hotel room. The same hotel room where there are photos of my wife in the same evening just wearing a dressing gown. It wasn't my intention to invade her privacy but she has always said she has nothing to hide from me and normally all the photos she takes are of the kids. This had me in shock and I couldn't believe what I had stumbled upon.\n\nI ended up finding a folder devoted to this guy, there were dick pics and a photo of them together. There were also screen captures of Facebook messages between them about how they enjoyed the sex and other lewd stuff.\n\nBy this time I was in shock and tried to piece together the timeline. It looks like this affair went on from at least late 2011 to into the new year and possible the summer of 2014 given that I found naked pics of my wife from that time and she certainly didn't send them to me.\n\nWe had only just celebrated our 13th wedding anniversary 2 weeks a go. We have been together 17 years and have a 14 year old and a 12 year old. \n\nSadly our wedding anniversary is just 2 days before the anniversary of my Mum's passing which happened 9 years ago.\n\nAbout 7 years ago we nearly got divorced, I didn't handle my Mum's death at all well. I was at her bedside when cancer took her life, it was brutal. She was in so much pain and it took so long. I don't think my wife ever appreciated just how much that affected me, both her parents live 5 minutes around the corner from us so it is difficult for to understand what I was going through.\n\nI was also working long hours and work was also very stressful at the time which didn't help. I ended up being so angry all the time and was an absolute genuine arsehole to live with. I was always taking it out on her and the kids with yelling and shouting. It is my 1 biggest regret in life. I eventually sought professional help and although it took a good while I managed to get back to more my old self. I even quit my job to get a less stressful one and went on a health kick as my weight had ballooned.\n\nI should point out at this stage that my wife suffers with fibromyalgia and chronic fatigue syndrome  I knew this when we got together and did my best to look after. I'd pick her meds up, take to appointments etc. \n\nBecause of this we don't have an active sex life, or so I thought. We did at first when we got together but after she was bed ridden for 10 months the sex became very sporadic. I accepted this as her health was more important and I loved her. However my daughter's conception (she is the 12 year obviously) is the last time we had sex. I have lived a life of celibacy that would make a monk leave his order in all that time. But now I have found that her illness wasn't bad enough for her screw some guy she met and \"fell in love\" with on Facebook.\n\nI even remember driving her to the train station as she doesn't drive, under the pretense that she was meeting up with her Facebook friends and the picking her up at the end of the weekend. Now I feel bloody stupid as I now know she lied to me and went to meet this guy. At this stage in 2011 I was still grieving over my Mum and were not in our bad patch at that time. I always felt at the time that I wasn't getting the love and support I needed when going through the grieving process. This didn't help when I went through my dark period as I felt very under appreciated and that I didn't matter as long as I was working hard and paying for the bills and putting food on the table.\n\nI was hoping that by going on the health kick, which I did mainly to prolong my life, that my wife would actually start to fancy me again. I got myself into fairly reasonable shape for my early 40's like I was when we first met. But nothing! She was pleased I lost the weight and looking healthier but she showed no physical attraction on her part. \n\nThere were a few times in the past that she brought up the subject of not having sex and said that she didn't mind if I went elsewhere for it. I didn't know if she was even serious or not but I never pursued it.  I am well aware that I am not the best looking guy, I was overweight and past my prime. Hell if my own wife didn't fancy me who the hell else will? Now I know she was suggesting I find sex elsewhere because of her guilt.\n\nIn short my confidence was completely shot and when I thought it couldn't get any lower I discovered those pics and messages.\n\nIt wasn't just the sex that I missed from the marriage but the kisses, the cuddles and the intimacy. She was getting those from this guy and I feel utterly worthless.\n\nI can't believe I fell for the lies and trusted her, I feel so betrayed and stupid.\n\nI can't go to my best friend because I married her. Or so I thought.\n\nI have never felt so hopelessly and desperately alone.\n\nI am sorry for the long post, I am still in shock and feeling sick to my core. If you read this far I thank you for your precious time in reading this.\n\nI don't necessarily expect any replies but really wanted to let my feelings out somewhere.

Its honestly painful, and my apologies to everyone who are going through these stages of life. Way back 4 years ago, I used to be very much active in this community, and going through.....God knows what, it's a mess. \n\nIt's not too long during these stages that I decided to chase after money, finding a perfect partner, friends, people to talk to, and drugs....just finding and looking for a way out. Day after day, it's just me trying to hide these negative feelings, ignoring it, numb it. I tried to talk to people about it, no one listened. I tried to hang out with friends more, didn't helped me neither, sometimes didn't even wanted to talk to me. Broken family, no one listened. Therapy, nothing. It's all inside me and I can never let it go. It's a stage of life that have lead me to questions my existence. Fast forward to a year in half later, meanwhile I'm doing well for myself financially. I decided to take a step back and really take a closer look of my life. I decided to go out in the real world, through embarrassment, awkwardness and struggles, to talk to people, network, and learned from the successfuls as well as the people who solved these issues themselves, massive research. I realized something that changed my life forever; \n\nIf you think about it, everything you're going through are controlled by your outer world. You let it be, you are the one who decided not to gain control of your life. \"Law of correspondence\" stated; \"your outer world is a reflection of your inner world.\" It is as though you live in a 360 degree mirror, everywhere you look, you see yourself reflected back at you. People treat you the way you treat them. The way you think about your physical body will be reflected in your health habits and your appearance. The way you think about people and your relationships will be reflected back to you in the quality of your friendships and your family life. In every case, your outer world reflects back to you, like a mirror image, exactly what you are thinking in the deepest recesses of mind. You brought to realities what you think about, believe, and expected.\nAt this point in time, it's important that you identifies firstly, your social life. Since this is what are massively shaping you as a person right now from actions, emotions, to behaviors. They're what makes you who you are.\n\nTo anyone who are going through difficult stages at the moment, I would love to talk to every single one of you personally. Please DM me and I'll promise you one thing at the end of the day. I'll change at least one lives this week (I'm off work for a week! :D), and just like me, you can then find who you really are and find your own true happiness again. Let\u2019s talk!\n\nBest regards to r/lonely fam", "subreddit": "lonely"}

I don't think I'm particularly ugly or boring or anything of that nature so it's probably just me. \n\nHigh school wasn't a great time for me as I was very depressed, had no friends, and was bullied.

I was never invited to parties or hangouts in high school so when I got to college I was new to everything and scared of everything. The college I go to is for art and design which is mostly women so I've never had more than 5 guys in a class (most of which are gay). For whatever reason, the girls I have crushes on are always straight or in relationships already. Don't get me wrong, I love my school and I have made real friends here but I am so craving non-platonic affection.\n\nIt's hard since I have anxiety because I'll never allow myself to be in a vulnerable position which is the key to having healthy relationships. I'll never think I'm \"desirable\" enough for someone to like me or maybe I set myself up for disaster with too high standards. When people flirt with me I get so defensive and uncomfortable even if it's someone I find attractive or it's not a catcall.

If you care, I'd like to explain why", "author": "Mukagas", "self_text": "So, I'm 19 Male. I should be going out with friends, maybe having a girlfriend, thinking about my future, my dreams.. And i was like that once. At my last year of HS, when I was 17 I was the quiet, shy, bitter kit of the class. Didn't speak a word to anyone, and needless to say, was depressed. It all changed when I got prescribed medication. I know some people say things like \"medication doesn't work waah\" but.. it kinda did. By the end of the year I had a couple of really good friends, and by october/november I even got my very first GF. At forst I didn't like me, but she kinda grew on me. And I realised we had a lot in common and well.. it just happened. It was the best time of my life. I was the happiest guy in the world, no doubt. Like, i went from being suicidal, to actually WANTING to get better so I could be a better person for her. I miss those times so much.. even if it lasted 2-3 months. Yeah. Thats how much it took her to get tired of me. That.. was probably the worst thing that ever happened to me. I know its dumb but I was literally in love. And seeing her getting distant from me after that first heavenly first 1 and a half month was just.. devastating for me. Hell.. I remember the last time I saw her.. we went to her best friend's borthday party, and I didn't really know anyone, and (they) were all having a good time and all. I was having a ok time. I was just hapoy being with her tho so it was fine. Until I decided to sit next to her on the sofa and she literally got up and sat on the other one in front of me. That right there broke my heart like a speedrunner breaks a game. The party went by she got kinda drunk (her first time drinking) and well.. we went home after that, called a uber, left her home and the next night we broke up via whatsapp. Thats it. We broke up via cellphone and I never saw nor talked with her again. (wich is probably for the best, cant imagine myself going home hold back my tears after breaking up with someone). As much as I'd like to think \"oh it was just teenage love lmao, its stupid lol\" I can't stop thinking that there is some genuine problem with me. You see, my problem is that I unfortunatelly give the idea that I'm a great guy. But then, when someone gets to know me, they find out I'm.. awful. And the reason I can say that its because, after almost 10 months I went to a party and hooked up with a woman (31 YO) who i also genuinelly really liked. We hit it off really good, and for 4 months we would talk everyday and occasionally meet for a drink and stuff, nothing sexual (yeah, 2 girls, still a virgin). After 4 months she starts to get kinda.. not so friendly. Like not mean or anything just like, not laughing at my jokes anymore (wich were all very good, mind you), being kinda cold with me, etc..\n\n\u200b\n\nThen one day, she just.. stopped messaging me. No goodbyes, no explanation.. nothing. Just silence. I wasn't in love with her. What hurt was not \"oh no I really liked her :(\" but more that.. It happened again. She just got bored or lost interest.. and once again I was left wondering.. what is wrong with me? I guess its just me? Like, I'm the problem. I don't have a problem, its just me. And no medication can cure that.\n\n\u200b\n\nThese events really scarred me for life. I now have no friends (literally, 0. Havent talked to someone in months) and I have to spend my time drinking and playing video games because if I spend 1 minute without distracting myself these thoughts become too much. I know some of you are going to say \"you are young!\" Or \"you had a gf normie GTFO reeeee\" and while those things are true.. it doesn't change the fact that I'm unloveable. The only difference is that.. I don't appear to be that bad for some people. Until they get to know me.\n\n\u200b\n\nWhat hurts even more is knowing that while I'm here almost crying typing this, my ex is probably thinking of another boy, if not her SO, probably will give her virginity to him (if she hasn't already) and she most certanly doesn't even remember me. And one day, when I kill myself (notice I said when, not if. Thats because I'm certain its going to happen. Its like watching a horror movie, you KNOW the white, chill couple is going to survive, and the other teenagers are going to die). When I kill myself, she probably wont ever find out. She'll live a happy life without me even crossing her mind. All because I don't have it.\n\n\u200b\n\nThere's this quote from Bojack Horseman that perfectly describe my text: \"...You didn't know me, then you fell in loce with me and... now you know me\".\n\n\u200b\n\nAnd no, these were not the only times I tried, I got rejected about 10 times in my life. I got pretty close to getting a girlfriend in the past (once or twice), but they just lost interest in me after some time, like always. There is no happy ending. Thats the worst part.\n\n\u200b\n\nI literally cannot even bring myself to try again. What is the point anyway? It's literally like keeping jumping out of a building hoping someday you'll fly. But you wont. And now I know I won't. I don't want to.\n\n\u200b\n\nI understand if some of you think \"you had a gf once, it can happen again/you are (N-word) a FA\". But i really don't think that'st true. We all have one thing in common, sure, but we are all different too, with differet lives. Just want you guys to know that I'm alone too.

That and I've rearranged past events to the point where I've convinced myself that she liked me but I only have conjecture and \"maybes\" to base this on. So basically she's the \"one who got away\" in my brain.\n\nHer husband of 5 years died roughly 2 years ago and his obituary ran in the local paper. I felt awful so I sent her a sympathy card because I felt it was the right thing to do and walked away. I'm not even sure if she actually received it but it's not like I kept in contact with her so I have no way to confirm.\n\nSo the \"hope\" that my classmate gave me was basically the age old \"pep talk\" about \"you might be able to reconnect with her someday, plenty of folk reconnect with people they once knew. I'm sure she still remembers you!\" So that got the gears turning and now I've been wallowing in self pity since Monday night. \n\nI'm slowly starting to pull myself back to my feet but I still feel like shit.

This is going to be a long one so please sit tight and get ready for cringe, quality banter, and some feels. I just need some sort of guidance.....\n\n\u00a0\n\nI would consider myself a generally above average looking guy, I have had a handful of girlfriends and have gotten laid on multiple occasions. I have the ability to have women gravitate towards me with just my looks alone as this has happened to me on multiple occasions during my time in university. I was in an face to face livestream with an IG model that was smoking hot and she called me \"pretty handsome\" and repetitively called me \"cool\" and wanted to meet me in real life.\n\n\u00a0\n\nSo you've gotten some lays and got some looks, why the fuck are you on this sub kid?\n\n\u00a0\n\nLet me begin....\n\n\u00a0\n\nI don't know why but whenever I approach a girl that I am interested in I fucking fold almost every attempt. I begin to sweat profusely, I stutter, my legs begin to shake vigorously, and my voice strength shrinks. Every approach just fucking crumbles within minutes because I come off as too strong, autistic, creepy, or just downright become socially stunted to the point where it's impossible for me to rebound. I have social interactions with fems in my classes and university clubs and I have female friends who i frequently talk to outside of classes so I have casual socialization skills but whenever it comes to the point where I approach a hot ass grill I fold heavily.\n\n\u00a0\n\nYet, there are times where my confidence shines when I least expect it to, for example; this morning when I was done parking my car I had to stand still in the parking garage lobby because it was pouring rain outside and I forgot my fucking umbrella so I was standing there just waiting for the rain to lighten up to the point where I can begin going to class. A pretty cute girl that was wayyy thicc approached me as she was unfolding her umbrella and exclaimed to me \" Hey where are you going come join me under this umbrella. \" I gave a semi confused look and looked over my shoulder just in case she was talking to someone else and looked back at her and responded \" Oh i'm going to the arts and sciences building. \" So we begin walking over to my designated building and I can barely keep my fucking shit together, at this point we go back and forth with some small talk and i'm actually not folding whatsoever. We reach my designated building and I say my farewell to her and tell her good luck in class. She gives a very sincere smile and at the same time has a dampened expression knowing that I will be leaving here. I'm pretty shook that I even made it to the building without stuttering once and we go our ways , as I begin pacing to class i'm thinking to myself that I should have snagged a number at the very least bc that was a golden opportunity. \n\n\u00a0\n\nEvery weekend there are very niche but nice hole in the wall clubs and pub venues that host music events or social gatherings and I attend these alone, I usually find a nice spot to sit down and smoke a weed filled blunt and just vibe to the tunes. I would love to bring a girl to these as most of the time they are free to enter and carry a romantic atmosphere but I always get left on read by female friends from class or get the usual \"i'm busy\" response. So again like almost every weekend I smoke my blunt and just self loathe about how I don't have the innate nature to go up and conversate with a hot fem without completely shitting the bed. \n\n\u00a0\n\nThe other day I saw a girl on IG and she was pretty cute and I saw that we had some mutual friends and went to the same uni so I hit her with a follow and she recently posted a pic of her in sweatpants and air force ones that were slightly dirty. I just woke up from a nap recently and I was feeling reckless so I commented \"scuffed af1\" just for the shits. Almost an hour later I get a snapchat from one of her mutual friends saying that I made her feel uncomfortable and that she was completely creeped out by my comment. I immediately unfollowed and deleted the comment and considered my chances with that girl annihilated. I have hit up girls in the dm's through instagram but almost every attempt ends up with me either getting left on read or unfollowed and I don't try to say creep shit like \"hey you're hot wanna fuck\" I just try to start a casual conversation and invite them to something that's going on the upcoming weekend. \n\n\u00a0\n\nI really don't know what to do at this point in my life. I have highly attractive qualities about me; good looks, marketable job skills, a healthy figure, excel in university courses, I have a car, great taste in fashion, I know how to cook fire food, I know how to clean, I keep myself consistently groomed, the list can keep going on and on and I just don't know how to get out of this rut and i feel as if it's impacting my mental health. Approaching fems that I am attracted to scares the life out of me but approaching fems that I am not attracted to is as easy as dapping up one of the boi's from the gym.\n\n\u00a0\n\nI've tried tinder and even there I get left on read consistently or match with transgender women. The girls that do actually respond are fucking obese ( no offense to heavy ppl reading this ) or are literal NEETs. So I've concluded to completely eliminate internet dating from my life as it is non-functional and only further disconnects me from actually developing social interaction skills.\n\n\u00a0\n\nI look back at the former times I have had girlfriends and have had sex and they were just sheer luck.\n\n\u00a0\n\nI feel like I will be forever alone if I continue down this path and it breaks me to my core smoking that blunt every weekend at the pub I even begin to shed a few tears knowing I could be giving so much attention and deserved love to a fem. Yet I just get left on read, rejected, or stood up. \n\n\u00a0\n\nI need some sort of guide to going up to women and begin to spit effective game. One of my friends that has women gravitate toward him on a consistent basis without him even trying tells me that his trick is just flirting with them for a little and then completely ignore them after that and they will chase after you. Whenever I try this strategy through instagram dm or with non-attractive test fems at uni, the fucking fem literally never chases back or even acknowledges my existence again.\n\n\u00a0\n\nI don't what what the fuck do to anymore.... I feel glad writing this all down as it makes me feel so relieved that I finally let it out. For anybody that made it this far down the lengthy read, thank you for your time.", "subreddit": "lonely"}

(this is on the first post) \n\nYou know she invited me to her group of friends to hang out. And we did every day. I remember all of those. Even when she was dating a friend of \u201dours\u201d every day after school for a while she would invite me and him to her house to hang out. It was awkward for me because she was always all over him. Making out and the such. Every time I would try to escape the would catch me, convince me to stay and include me in the conversation for a while. Then when she was deep over the other dude again I would sneak out. \n\nOne of her ex-boyfriends once told me one of the reasons he didn't like dating her. As he described her super goofy nature, and her shenanigans that she did that really annoyed him, I just had a smile on my face. Thinking \u201dthat is beautiful!\u201d I love her kind of crazy and wild. \n\nI always remember how cute she looked when she did something playfully bad. How she would tilt her head and stare at the ground. The tip of her tongue wedged gently between her teeth with a smile that would put the crescent moon to shame, all the while giggling wildly. \n\nHow she would tease you playfully. Grab something of yours and make you chase her for a bit. \n\nYou see, every single high school memory I have, she's in it. Everyone. \n\nWe haven't seen each other for many years but still talk. I started driving a truck over the road, she joined the military and served our nation. She met her children's fathers while serving and after. \n\nBut we still talk. Granted only through Facebook but it's something. We don't interact as we used too but that's life wedge ld between us. \n\nI would do anything for her. \n\nI want to tell her all that so damn badly. How much I love her, how much I've always loved her. Dam it I'm getting out of control here.......\n\nEDIT 3:\nso I probably did something stupid. I contacted an old mutual friend of ours. One of her best friends from high school, and a good friend of mine too. Unfortunately she couldn't say anything except that she has a tendency to go for losers. They haven't really spoken or seen each other in a long time either. Damn. Why does everyone have to have their own lives?? \ud83d\ude02\ud83e\udd23\ud83d\ude02\n\n\nEDIT 4\nso I did it this morning. I finally did it. I told her everything this morning. It felt liberating!! But now I await her response. It's been a few hours so far. She's still liking and reacting to my Facebook posts and comments so I'm hoping this is a good sign!!", "subreddit": "ForeverAlone"}

Being that I'm Aspergers/HFA, I've always struggled socially and have never had much of a social circle, especially now as the years have passed and people I knew have drifted off and built their lives with significant others. I've been trying to meet people but it's a very daunting thing when you're older and you don't have the forced socialization environment of school, etc. and most of your peers are settled down by now. I've been trying meetup, with very limited success, having only made a couple of acquaintances but nothing beyond that and I've had zero luck with online dating. I find it hard to relate to others in my age range when I've attended meetups; it's become apparent to me how far behind my peers I've fallen in terms of the social skills I never fully developed in my younger years, life milestones, achievements, and I find I have little to talk about or contribute. My life is very empty and meaningless. It would be nice to have someone to talk to, someone to come home to other than an empty quiet studio apartment, someone to hang out with, even. I don't have anyone I can even talk to about how work went. I have basically zero social life, and my only interactions with other humans is at work (and I'm a short-haul overnight truck driver, so not much there), the occasional Meetup, and when I go out for takeout or coffee or groceries.\n\nI get to watch the lives of my younger siblings, cousins, former classmates progress from the sideline of social media, posting pics of their happy memories and their families while I sit alone in my apartment drinking myself into a dull haze on my nights off to try to ignore the stagnation of my life. I see how happy and thrilled my mom is with the grandkids and beautiful daughter-in-law my younger (half) brother gave her, I see my dad comment on the engagement announcement of my other younger brother how hopeful he is for grandkids and that he's their best hope right now. I am lonely, so fucking lonely it hurts. Some nights I collapse and cry until I can't anymore, some nights I feel so close to just seriously considering ending it all because it's all so fucking pointless. This isn't how I hoped my life would turn out. My much younger self would probably cry if I could step through time and tell him where he'd be when he is facing middle age.

The lyrics, roughly paraphrasing, tell the story of a monkey and bear who escape some kind of repressive situation. Though initially ecstatic to be free, Bear finds herself being exploited by Monkey, who continually tells her that true freedom is just around the corner, but for now she has to continue the same kind of degrading work they escaped in the first place. Monkey's repeated deceptive assurances remind me of what we typically call \"normie advice\" or just \"platitudes.\"  This portion in particular:\n\n*\"Will you keep your fancy clothes on for me?*\n\n*Can you bear a little longer to wear that leash?*\n\n*My love, I swear by the air I breathe:*\n\n*Sooner or later, you'll bare your teeth*\n\n*\"But for now, just dance, darling.*\n\n*C'mon, will you dance, my darling?* \n\n*Darling, there's a place for us;*\n\n*Can we go, before I turn to dust?*\n\n*Oh my darling, there's a place for us.*\n\n*Oh darling,*\n\n*C'mon will you dance, my darling?*\n\n*Oh, the hills are groaning with excess*\n\n*Like a table ceaselessly being set.*\n\n*Oh my darling, we will get there yet.\"*\n\nAgain, no idea if there are even other fans here, and she's polarizing (to say the least), so no idea if any new fans will come from me posting this. But personally, \"table ceaselessly being set\" is about the most amazingly succinct expression of relentless effort that never pays off that I can imagine. The refrain of \"C'mon, will you dance, my darling?\" encapsulates every dismissive \"Just work out and put yourself out there\" comment I've ever heard. And \"Will you keep those fancy clothes on for me?\" is very nearly literally true for me, as I don't give a shit about fashion, but still find myself buying nice clothes and posting to malefashionadvice in some vain attempt to assemble a wardrobe that belies my apathy.", "subreddit": "ForeverAlone"}

My family has lives way busier than mine and I struggle to find time to see any of them. Ill be wasting their time anyway. It's hard being in public and not having anyone to laugh with and share secrets with or just anyone by my side. Then again i'm an introvert so I perfer to stay indoors but thats besides the point. It's just too hard to be myself because I'm the one who wants to feel love and get love and give love, but I was smart enough to stop myself from giving into peer pressure and toxic people. Yet still feeling empty inside could be worse than at least having someone there even if they are a brainless prick. But it's too late to change my mind. Instead I get to watch all these jocks and stuck-ups and wannabe gangsters and soldiers get all the praise and not even appreciate it. Fuck that. Fuck them. Sometimes I decide to be myself until the day I borrow Kurt Cobain's microphone or die of old age or even die of a brain aneurysm in the middle of the night so I wont have to endure the pain of my untimely demise. Despite the hard facts I face almost everyday, I have heard from my family and a few of my friends that I guess I'm really smart guy, maybe I was a little funny and had a few unique things about me, but no one would want to invest the time to find out those things or even listen to me talk about my personal projects and ideas. Being ignored to the bone and an outcast to everyone, especially by my own blood, creates a terrible amount of depression that I wouldn't wish upon my worst enemy. It also feels like every time I want to make friends I just get momentary praise or I get dragged along by someone so they won't damage their social status or ego. Fuck that. I'm also tired of people saying that they have it way worse than me. It makes me believe i'm not allowed to be sad. Like I don't deserve to feel depressed, which is very meta and I dont know what to say to that. I remember back to some of my friends that I had where I would talk with them and do favors for them and when I asked if they wanted to hang out, the reply would always be \"Oh sorry. I'm busy.\" or something like that. And the only thing you could reply to that was \"Oh ok. Sorry\" because if you even dared to question why they always reject your invitations, you can consider yourself dead to them. This whole life that I live is just a cycle of dullness that will never be cleaned, like a rust spot on a piece of a car that wont go away. And yet my cousins have such better lives than me and i'm not too far from their age. One is living with her german gamer boyfriend and their all hunky dory in love. One is  an aspiring abstract artist. One is a body builder that actually got signed by a fucking company. One is still in ASU but has a network of friends and plays Steam games with them when not at school. But I guess I wasnt born under the right circumstances to be a successful person. At best I'll be some coder or game designer that comes home late to a wife struggling with some mental disorder and a kid going through the same perils I'm going through right now. Its just hard not to think about suicide nowadays when everyone you know has much better and busier lives than you and your left with a community of hood rats and scumbags that all want something out of you. Its hard to find real friends and have someone to talk to and vent to and get support when I'm having a bad day. Not even one person to share a singular deep thought with. Even though I dont want to change for people, I hate who I have become. I dont know if being dumb makes me smart or being smart makes me dumb. I remember a lot of stupid shit ive done pretty often. It races around my brain like an earworm and it just cant be ignored. Believe me I've tried. Some days I just want to straight up die. I'm fascinated by existentialism. What does it really feel like to die? To eat a bullet, to burn to death, to fall face first onto hard pavement. And afterwards, do we go anywhere? Heaven? Hell? Afterlife? Ascension? Are there any gods to answer my questions? Anyone out there in the great unknown? I guess I'll never know. And I dont want to know. My life is for a very lonely soul, but I know I don't really want to die. I just want the pain to end. But it never will end, even if I try. So I dont know what to do anymore. Maybe one day I'll get lucky and be diagnosed with cancer or some other life ending disease, because then I wouldnt have to worry about if I want to be alive next week. I'll get an expiration date. I know fully fucking well that I dont have it the worst, but it dosent change the fact my only source of community are suicide hotlines. I need help. I don't know how I'll get help, but I need help. I don't care to text someone either. I want to hear someones voice. I want to see someone's smile. I want to hug someone as they hug me back.

Sorry in advance for that.\n\nTLDR: Usually suppress emotions, thought friend had a crush on me, let emotions out, almost talked to her about it, now I'm back into reality and facing a major depressive episode. Scared. \n\nI usually methodically suppress my emotions in order to be a useful member of society and all that, not to mention that my family usually believes that if I'm sad I should tell them everything and get angry if I don't. So I'm usually kinda starting to become sort of a shell. Sometimes feelings escape and I have a depressive episode, those vary in length and harshness. I'm also very straight forward with myself when it comes to my future, I know that I'll probably die alone and there are times, due to the emotion suppression and all, when I'm even okay with that. Just ended up with a bad hand for this part of life, it happens.\n\nI do have friends and pretty great ones at that, they are very supportive and even manage to tolerate my boring nature. Pretty much all of them are completely normal, tho, so problems that FAs face are very hard for them to understand.\n\nRecently, I've been led to believe that a friend of mine has a crush on me. In my usually controlled world view, that's completely impossible, but the signs were sorta evident enough that I even ignored the little voice in my head and started considering. That was the fucking mistake, I talked to my best friend about and later spoke with my therapist. They encouraged me saying that it's a very possible thing and that I should pursue it, that it's never too late to start having romantic relationships and all that (only my therapist knows that I'm 22 years old and never kissed anyone).\n\nSo for around a week I freed myself from the mental restraints and started seeing myself as the sort of person that could one day be happy in this aspect and all that shit. To be completely honest it felt... Great. I ALMOST attempted to talk to her, set up a date. But now reality is knocking at the door and I'm wondering why in the fuck I would be stupid enough to think that it was even remotely possible that something like that is happening. Holy fucking shit, how dumb do I become when I let myself have feelings? I forget my place in this world for five seconds and start pretending I'm just a regular Joe.\n\nNow I'm starting to feel probably the worst depressive episode in many many years creeping up on me and I'm honestly terrified of it. I'm quite sure I'm too terrified of death to ever off myself (not to mention the whole mom and pets will be sad deal) so you don't have to worry about that, if anyone read through all of this. But I'll be completely miserable and useless for around a month or more, and it will be quite bad.\n\nAgain, I'm sorry for rambling, guys.

Over the summer I had a ton of friends, I was meeting new people on a weekly basis. Everywhere I go at least three people would ask to add me on Snapchat. I hung out with someone every single day. It all kind of fell apart and died at the same time, which happens to coincide with the time I moved.\n\nI had an awful relationship with my dad and stepmom who I lived with. I spent almost every night somewhere else. Finally I was able to afford to escape and move out, and now I live alone in my own apartment. That was a month and almost two weeks ago, my dad hasn\u2019t spoken to me since, and my mom was never in my life to begin with. I feel like I have no parents, no one who is there for me, and no one who loves me in the way that family should.\n\nI had like two best friends. One of them, 21F, got a boyfriend about 6 months ago, her first boyfriend, and he has already moved in with her (he did after 3 months) and they spend every day and night together. He\u2019s actually great and their relationship is great, she is happy for the first time and it is amazing to see, but I have seen her like 5 times since then. I come up with all these fun things to do with her and she straight up says no and that she doesn\u2019t want to, then won't answer me for days. \n\nMy other best friend was my ex, 24M. We had mutually decided about 6 months ago that we are better off as friends together. He was my closest friend, I told him everything. One night when I was talking about how lonely I felt due to feeling abandoned by my family and other friends, he absolutely lost it and said that he didn\u2019t care about my feelings, my emotions, my life, or me at all, and that if I bring up my feelings again to him he cannot be in my life anymore. \n\nSince then I have had no one to talk to. I put all my thoughts and feelings into a giant Word document now. There\u2019s no one I talk to on a daily basis. I started getting drunk every night for three weeks straight, I stopped this past Saturday because I was worried about becoming dependent on alcohol.\n\nI have lost all interest in meeting new people, I am sick of people because to me everyone I know is a fake friend. Friendship is so valuable to me, I would do anything for any of my friends, but none of my friends will even listen to my thoughts or feelings or hang out with me anymore. In my opinion friends should care about each other and be there for each other. No one was excited for me for moving out and being on my own. Yet if any of my friends were moving out I would die from excitement and want to be involved in every step of the way, and chill at their place constantly. Someone was supposed to help me move because he had a truck but he ghosted me, and I moved everything by myself in my little sedan, taking about five trips back and forth, carrying everything down the street to the building and up the stairs, about one box at a time out of like a hundred boxes, plus it was pouring rain when I did it. No one wanted to help me.\n\nI hate these conflicting feelings of wanting to be close with someone so bad but not wanting to either. I know I wouldn\u2019t be able to handle one more person getting close with me and then telling me they do not give a shit about my thoughts or feelings or life. I want to learn to be content alone and to accept that I will always be alone. Sometimes I feel empowered when I think about how alone I am and how I am completely by myself in life, but other times it cripples me with pain. Is it possible to become content with being alone? If not, does it at least get easier?", "subreddit": "lonely"}

I honestly think that outside of older ages (35+), good looks are significantly more important than personality when it comes to women.", "author": "cooljellian", "self_text": "I'm 22 and I have friends, and I don't have problems talking to girls.We can have friendly conversation - they just don't like me. They don't find me attractive, it's obvious when you're talking to a girl if she's interested or not. They will try to ask you questions, or be curious about you. They will make more eye contact with you, and if you manage to get their number they will be genuinely interested in conversing with you. n In real life, a girl can't just ignore you or reply when she wants. When texting if a girl isn't really interested she will often delay her response significantly, and when she does respond it's often a one sided conversation. A response out of politeness more than genuine interest. She might even find you funny but being funny just gains you friends, girls will laugh at you but that doesn't mean they want to be with you.Why don't they, they might even enjoy your presence but you will never pass that line of being viewed as attractive - and the answer is clear. \n\nBecause you aren't physically attractive enough. Men that are ugly but with good personalities will gain friends, but not sexual partners. I believe that more than anything that looks determine whether a girl likes you, it's the ultimate defining feature. Now when i say this I don't mean that you have to be a chad, but you have to pass a certain threshold of physical attraction. A girl might perfer a 7/10 over an 8/10 guy due to other reasons, but no matter how amazing a  personality a 5/10 guy has - outside of being a celebrity or very wealthy, he won't get the girl. That is appearance has diminishing returns, once you're good looking enough then defeating the competition is up to outside factors.\n\nI thus believe the blackpill in this sense, it's the most important trait and having a bad personality, being a bad person often has no real impact on wheteher you get girls. Even being a misogynist doesn't prevent you from getting girls. Like you have to be deluded to think that women have some personality detector that makes them repulsed by guys with questionable views. Neo nazis often have no problem getting laid, look at any radical right wing group and you'll see that most of these men are married or have had partners. They aren't incels, or FA. All these right wing politicians who pass mysognistic laws and shit, they have 0 problems finding a wives they're all married with kids. According to inceltears, men like this should be virgins as all women are repulsed by men with bad sexist personalities . The truth is that most abuse women recieve from men is from partners and spouses  Like it's not lonely men who are harming women the most, it's usually men who have no problem getting girls. That is for me the ultimate blackpill.", "subreddit": "ForeverAlone"}

But then at one point my friends went home and I found myself alone there.\nI think I just felt out of place, as I normally feel in most situations. The thing that made me feel it the most was the fact that I felt as a spectator of other people talking with each other, dancing and overall having a good time. And I felt 3 miles away from everyone else, like if I was looking at everything from afar. I tried to enjoy the night and talk whit other people but in the end the loliness took the best on me and I had to bail out.\nThing is, I'm used to feel distant from other people all the time, but tonight was different. It made me realize just how much I would like to have some human contact. Even an hug would be fine. Because I think that what I need the most is someone to love me. Maybe I just miss that because I knew too well how that sensation was intoxicating and beautiful. Just someone that cares about you, that touches you and hold you tight like you were the most precious thing in the World and smiles just by looking at your face. I probably just miss that because I once had it. \nI've been together with a girl for a little more than 2 years and I think that in that time I truly experienced what happiness really is about. Of course all came crushing down when she just stopped loving me. She then left me saying that it was all my fault and then few days later she got with another guy (You know, something that has happend to a lot of people).\nMaybe it was really my fault, I've never been good at opening up and showing my emotions because I've always been afraid to appear needy to other people.\nBut, as much as I try to not admit it to myself, I think that that experience broke a little something inside of me because I have anxiety just at the though of trusting other people and make an effort to talk with them and stuff.\nSorry for the long vent but this night made me realize just how much I feel alone even in a crowd full of people.\n\nPS. : sorry for any errors, english is not my first language and plus I'm kinda drunk, hence this post right here.\n\nHope you all have a good night and just thanks for reading my ramblings.", "subreddit": "ForeverAlone"}

I have nothing about myself to hold myself up with.\n\nI especially hate knowing things others that could've been me are doing, the many social and intimate lives other humans get to have. I'm fine with being lonely but I'm a jealous bastard and can't stand that others get it. Not that I'd honestly want any human companion at this point, I'm too socially averse. Better and easier to be alone. For many reasons. I try to tire myself out thinking of fantasy. \n\nI'm out of wine, that stresses me out. Being out of booze stresses me to an alarming degree, but who am I trying to impress. I'm impressed with who I can be in public, that's enough for me. \n\nI'm attracted to men too. Not that I'd know how to flirt with anyone, but it's funny I'm still lonely. Sometimes I wonder if I want a boyfriend just because I am and was chronically unable to get a girlfriend.", "subreddit": "ForeverAlone"}

First &amp; foremost I've long since accepted I will never find anyone. Maybe it's a curse, genetics, or bad luck but it's the truth. Rather than dwell on it I've decided to look on the bright side, focusing the time &amp; energy that I'd wasted on finding a girlfriend on other things. Finishing my degree, getting in shape, reading more, &amp; working towards becoming an officer. Crazy but yes there are officers &amp; higher enlisted how are single, though by choice or FA I can't say.\n\nWith that said I've maintained a healthy form of contact with friends &amp; family back hope who are proud of me &amp; support my dreams. I will be returning to the place I once called home in late Jan. for my birthday as it would be more economic for me to do so than during the holidays. It will be my last visit to AZ unless I reclass to aviation &amp; sent there for training. I've also maintained comradeship with the soldiers in my platoon, especially the newer Privates. I get the feeling our NCOs see me as a good example for them &amp; are pushing for me to step up to the plate so I may be in their shoes one day. I'm pretty well known in my unit &amp; I must say while not the unit I imagined I can see myself growing in it. \n\nI'm on track for a promotion 1 Nov. &amp; have volunteered for Soldier of the Month later this month. Hopefully I'll be able to get my drivers license &amp; a car come early Dec. following my return from an assignment. \n\nOverall I'm much happier than I ever was in AZ. While not a success story in the proper sense, I have come to make the best of it &amp; as such I'm proud of the progress I've made &amp; look forward to what the future holds. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/co4enhe6jur31.jpg?width=1920&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9ba6383a444c6e5f6f3eccab5cb24edb00c6f035", "subreddit": "ForeverAlone"}

I used to google \u201c15 and never had a girlfriend\u201d and used to talk to a friend about how I\u2019ll never find anyone. He assured me this wouldn\u2019t be the case. \n\nIf that child knew that 23/24 year old me was still struggling to even get a woman to look at him\u2014let alone date him or have sex with him\u2014he\u2019d have just given up all hope on trying to find anyone and focused on his studies, career, and earning money. But I don\u2019t even have that to be honest, because I\u2019m a graduate who has been in retail for 2 1/2 years whilst I\u2019ve had friends get good jobs and girlfriends. I just go to work, go to the gym, go out with friends where possible (but since they\u2019re getting girlfriends and getting older they\u2019re drifting away anyway), go to a bar by myself, play video games, write on my blog, and occasionally hike. I do most of my hobbies alone. \n\nPeople tell us this isn\u2019t a big deal but it fucking is. I\u2019m always hearing about dating and relationships. I\u2019m always having to read and hear about sexual escapades and the things people do when they like each other. If these things weren\u2019t a big deal then very few people would do these things. \n\nI go through periods where I give up and keep trying, but the periods of trying are far more painful because it reminds me how far gone I am. Giving up is the path of least resistance for me and while I wouldn\u2019t say I\u2019m happy, I\u2019m not sad or painfully depressed from trying and not getting anything out of it. Being on this earth for nearly a quarter of a century and having a firm grasp of my attractiveness to women has made me realise that the only way to find someone is through sheer luck, and that the only way to get laid is to pay for it (which I am ashamed to say that I am considering). I\u2019ve tried cutting down on jerking off because I want to disassociate my brain from sex as much as possible and I\u2019ve decreased my social media usage and social contact because the pain of hearing what other people are doing with their lives makes me sink deeper. \n\nLife\u2019s too fucking long. I\u2019m approaching my mid 20s and it already feels like I\u2019ve rotted away from the inside. It\u2019s not that I\u2019m currently suicidal but it\u2019s like I would certainly like to kill whatever is inside me that wants a relationship and sex. These things have been my main source of misery and suffering and it\u2019s clear to me that I don\u2019t think I\u2019ll find these things.

Keep in mind, I've only had like one conversation with this girl before, so I haven't really tried talking to her much. So my friend adds her, and she actually adds me back! Sounds good, right? Well... Anyway, my friend, after he adds her, sends her a message. I wake up the next day and she actually messaged me back. I think \"Cool! Maybe I can start something,\" so I messaged her back something, but I got left on the dreaded \"Opened\" status. I didn't know what to do. I didn't want to try messaging her again if she didn't want to talk to me. So I left it at that and told myself \"I'll try talking to her in person again if I get the chance\"\n\nThis leads into today, because I had that chance like 30 minutes ago. I go to grab some lunch from a sandwich shop in one of my school's buildings, and as I walk in I see her. She's just sitting at a table by herself. So I order my sandwich, and as I'm getting it I'm thinking \"Alright, this is your chance. She's just sitting there by herself, now's your chance to try talking to her so you can get to know her more. You told yourself you were going to try talking to her in person again. So do it!\"\n\nI couldn't do it. I don't know if I was too shy, or too scared, or too nervous, or what! But I just couldn't do it! I had a wave of insecurities like \"What if she thinks I'm a creep because I added her on SnapChat while barely knowing her (Thank you to my friends) or 'What if she thinks I'm weird and just doesn't want to talk to me?\" So I just walked out of the building. back to my dorm in defeat. You know? I've always believed that you should take chances, because you never know what it could lead to. I couldn't even follow my own advice today. I'm pathetic.", "subreddit": "ForeverAlone"}

My friends and classmates used to make fun of me because of my dark skin. Everybody used to underestimate me and my skills just because the way I look and it's been 20 years now and people still do that, not much though. This kind of environment lead me to become the quiet kid in class who rarely asks questions or gets into fights. I'm an introvert and I feel very strange being one because I think that either I'm less of an ordinary person or I'm better than others which more or less makes me feel like a weirdo. \n\nDue to my insecurities, I could never get a girlfriend in school and when I finally had the confidence to express my feelings to any girl who I've liked till now, either they would reject me or give me false hopes and finally date someone else who is better looking than me and has lots of money to spend. Just a year ago, I developed feelings for a girl who I had know since 2016, and I guess she was the only one who really wanted to date me for me being me. We used to talk everyday, asking about how our day went, what events happened and all that kinda stuff (be both lived in different cities). She was a fan of my singing. She was one of the reasons I had started singing again after damaging my vocal chords after excessive smoking. I also did sing a song for her birthday which was in May. This was the month where we would start talking less and I was confused that did she really like me or was just using me to entertain herself. It still hurts whenever I think about my experience with women. \n\nI'm currently a college student. I have developed a better personality here. I mix with everyone, I help anyone who is in need, I try to help my classmates when I see them mentally stressed or disturbed, I can now give a speech confidently in front of my class. While this daily routine kept going on and on, I realized that I do things for people which I have never got from anyone. I never had a friend who'd make me feel less miserable about myself. As the days are passing by, I notice that my friend circle is becoming smaller. Also, I never had a good relationship with my family. There would be disagreements with my family on a daily basis. This would make me feel irritated most of the times. \n\nThe point is I know that I have the capabilities to become a successful man in the future, I'll have everything I had ever wished for but I guess I'll always be lonely and will never have friends who act like your pillars and will never find someone who falls for me and not for my looks or my financial status.", "subreddit": "lonely"}

I\u2019ve always had issues with other people. My dad used to beat me and I\u2019ve never had an actual relationship with him. Every time he *tries* to be nice to me or compliment me, it just feels so forced. Like he\u2019s just doing it so he looks good. I know how he really is, how selfish, narcissistic, and cruel he can be. I\u2019ve always wanted a positive male influence in my life, but because of this, nothing fatherly feels genuine. It all just feels like a lie. In the end they want something from me, and I don\u2019t know what it is, but I don\u2019t want to get hurt again, so I\u2019m not going to fall for their trap. I finally became close to the new boy in school in 7th grade. I\u2019m an incredibly shy girl, but back at my old school, there were only 60 kids in my grade and I had known them all since kindergarten, so I thought, \u201che must feel just as lonely as I do right now. No one should feel that, I\u2019m gonna try to be his friend,\u201d, and I talked to him all recess about Pok\u00e9mon. What generation was his favorite, how he felt about sun and moon\u2019s new art style, and stuff that was in the news at the time. We became close really fast, and by February of 8th grade, I had realized that I had my first crush. I loved him. In my eyes, he was perfect. Sure, he tended to ignore me, but I was used to people doing that. He was the only person who spoke to me outside of school, so naturally, I felt that he was the first man who actually cared. I was wrong. He had a group of internet friends that he had started talking to more and more, becoming more distant with me. It terrified me. I didn\u2019t want to loose him too, so I came forward about my feelings. I told him about my terrible depression, how my father used to beat me, and how I didn\u2019t want to live anymore. I thought that he would help me. That he was my ticket out of my personal hell. That I was finally going to be free and loved. But he didn\u2019t. All he had to say was \u201cget some help, don\u2019t talk to me about this\u201d. I didn\u2019t want help, I just wanted someone who cared about me. I wanted a friend to tell me they cared for me and they wanted to see me happy, but I didn\u2019t get that. I guess it\u2019s because I never had that to begin with. I told him that. I told him that I wished he would be supportive forwards me right now, that I really needed a good friend more than anything and that I would love for that to be him. That\u2019s a lot of pressure to put on someone, I know, but, he said that he was my best friend, that I could trust him with anything. And I did just that. He didn\u2019t respond to my messages for a week, I thought he had gotten seriously injured. I was absolutely horrified. But he finally responded. It hurt him too much to speak to me, apparently. He never wanted me to contact him again. He blocked me on absolutely everything. After that, I didn\u2019t speak to anyone I knew for about four months. In February, out second semester classes had started for freshman year, and I had study hall with a girl who had just gotten switched to that class. She asked to sit with me at lunch, and we became fast friends. After that, I made a couple of other friends too. I felt more confident, more hopeful in my future. A few weeks ago, a girl that I really had cared about, and the only other friend I had freshman year, had started messaging me when I was down the beach with my close friend that I had study hall with. She was sending absolute nonsense, and when I called her, a man answered the phone and said he had given her LSD. I was in a state of utter fear. I had 911 dialed up and ready to call, but when my other friend called, they revealed that it was all a prank, not knowing that I was in the room with her. The didn\u2019t want me to know. I had a breakdown after that. Another person I had placed my trust into completely stabbed me in the back. I\u2019ve recovered since then, with the help of my friends. Then it happened, I had finally gotten a crush on another boy. I asked him out recently, but he said he was focusing on his studies. I knew that was just his way of politely saying no though. It just brought back a lot of pain. Like ripping off a bandaid to an infected wound. I found another guy though. He\u2019s so sweet. I haven\u2019t told anyone how I feel about him yet, this time I want to take things slow with him. I just want to be loved by a guy more than anything on earth. But I\u2019m not sure if I can ever really have that. The only thing I fear I\u2019ll ever be able to have is pure silence. No one messaging me. No one calling me. No one trying to talk to me or interact with me. It\u2019s all just static. And it\u2019s deafening. All I can hear are my own screams for help. That I just want to escape my own personal hell. I just want to escape the ocean and step onto the shore and bask in the warm sunlight. I don\u2019t think I can ever have that though, and while it hurts, I know that that\u2019s what I deserve.\n\n\nSorry this post is so long and mushed together, I just typed it up in the heat of the moment :/", "subreddit": "ForeverAlone"}

We\u2019ve been friends for about 8 years now. Of course we were really close a long time ago, when we were kids, but since high school started and she started socializing we\u2019ve grown apart significantly. But it\u2019s fine because we still hang out once a month or so. I really appreciate having that connection in my life. \n\nBut it\u2019s sucks because that\u2019s my only connection, besides family and counsellors. I can\u2019t befriend counsellors; it\u2019s a rule. Plus they don\u2019t stay. They\u2019re not allowed to. And I have social anxiety so it\u2019s nearly impossible to try and makes friends at school. I can barely string together a simple sentence without my anxiety making me stumble my words. I\u2019m working through it but it\u2019s hard. \n\nThough there\u2019s one thing that makes me hesitant about even thinking of attempting to start a conversation with someone. \n\nOne day I was having a conversation with said friend. She told me she doesn\u2019t really like this person that she hangs out with but they have this one redeeming quality that makes it worth it to hang out with them. I wondered what mine was so I asked. She thought about it for a little while and finally said she doesn\u2019t know. I pushed a little more because I\u2019m annoying like that and she was getting tired of me annoying her so she said just said I\u2019m nice. I didn\u2019t believe her, though. I\u2019m not so nice that it would be my one redeeming quality. At least not with her. So a few days later I asked again. This time she said she didn\u2019t know and that the reason why we\u2019re friends is because we\u2019ve been friends for a long time. And I thought about it. It\u2019s true. I really don\u2019t have any redeeming qualities. So why should I even try to make friends? It\u2019s not going to work. I\u2019d be a terrible friend because I\u2019m a terrible person. She told me I\u2019m clueless and a downer. She often looks at me as though I said the weirdest thing ever. I can\u2019t handle being so terrible. I wish I wasn\u2019t who I was. I am strange and scary and depressing and crazy. \n\nI wish I had a person to come to school and hang out with with. Just one. Just one person to share a strong connection with. I know I need to put in the effort but I can\u2019t right now. I\u2019m not expecting them to come to me or anything, I\u2019m just too scared to talk.

I was the 8th child in my family. My older siblings wouldn\u2019t socialize with me that much as a kid. I talked with my older brother (7th kid) a lot back then. My dad  worked during the day so I never saw him. My mom was consumed with church and my grandma (dads side) lived with us. She was very controlling of my mom. So my mom did not want to raise us with her there, so she chose to pray for our lives to get better and neglected us. \n\nGrowing up, I didn\u2019t know how to interact with people. At home I was pretty lonely most of the time. Before I started school my siblings bullied me and told me my voice sounded more masculine so I was ashamed to speak infront of others. So I was known as the mute girl and as you know being mute isn\u2019t good for making friends. So I had none. \n\nWhen we moved and I was starting 5th grade I told myself I would start talking. But I didn\u2019t know how to engage in conversations. And everyone knew each other from the previous years. I was pretty shy and kept to myself. Some people tried to talk to me. But I didn\u2019t know how to reply. So it never went anywhere. \n\nSenior year of high school, there was a swimming lesson and I almost drowned. And when I was in the water I thought to myself. I\u2019m gonna die and I honestly don\u2019t mind. Nothing is going on in my life. But then a lifeguard saved me and I went home right after. I never told anyone about it. That was the first time I cried so much and realized how pathetic my life really was.  \n\nAnd here I am at age 24 thinking I should have died that day. I have no idea what I\u2019m doing in life. I have no friends. I\u2019m surprised I found a boyfriend. But now my negativity from my past trauma is tainting our relationship. I\u2019m extremely depressed and have so much social anxiety.

Near the end of that period, I felt a kind of loneliness that shrank the value of any friendship I had at the time. When I had my first and only close friend, an online friend to be specific, I'm confident that she was the thing I valued most in my life. That friendship presented me with the opportunity to be more lonely, and I took it. It further shrank the value of existing friendships, and I had too much of a drive to invest in that relationship. A solution is to make more close friends.\n\nMy problem with loneliness is much older than my Reddit account. I started taking small steps to resolve my issue using Reddit, something I have used nearly constantly (perhaps unhealthily), since the day I made my account. Notice my account's age, and when I started being truly active here. That's basically at least a year of me being in the same state.\n\nRight now, I'm in a better situation. I've interacted with a few people, some I don't interact with anymore, some I infrequently interact with, and one I'm confident I'll be close friends with. That'll be two close friends. So it works. I could have done this around a year earlier. 11 more of these fruitful and happier months. 12 times the opportunities. That's a lot, and I feel better with only one month.\n\nThis unfortunately doesn't do a lot to help someone who has problems initiating an interaction with someone new. Think of the time you've lost. Try to break the world record for fastest comment made, or fastest direct message sent. I don't want you to think of how you'll open. Just a random number or character or letter will be fine, as long as the text is sent faster than you can think to change your mind. Remember your lost time, and think of the time you may lose if you delay.\n\nYou might be worried that this will go poorly, or you might do something stupid. That's fine, as long as you persist. If it helps, I fell in love with the first person I interacted with here within four days of meeting them, only to learn that the feelings she had only came out of alcohol. I've learned from that, not to be naive, and not to rush things. I hope you'll learn with me if things don't go well. I persisted and carried what I learned, to different people, and now things are good. It gets easier the more you do it.\n\nI hope you get blessed with a need for action.

So I reach a point where I can't hold anymore and I simply start staring at the walls trying not to cry, and yet, no one cares. And I go away, and no one even asks if I am doing fine. Every attempt just makes me much worse than I was before.\n\nI just want to find a place to belong to. I wanna be hugged so much, not by someone offering free hugs to random people or just out of kindness. I wanted someone that hugged me for the appreciation of the warmth that I transmit, if I do transmit any warmth at all. I cannot come with any other explanation for this in my life but that I am indeed, somehow, considerably less desirable than regular people, or maybe even repulsive. Some kind of disgusting human being in some form I cannot recognize. I am going through this for so many years and I have tried so many things and acting so many ways, but it never works...\n\nEveryday I am more convinced that isolating myself and accepting this state of affairs as a natural consequence of my conditions will prevent me from distressing myself more. I wanna hate myself more than everyone else so I won't feel any more pain because of it.\n\nSorry for wasting your time, reader. I just have no one else to share this with, so I am sharing it here. Probably the worst possible place. No need to be kind if this text has somehow bothered you, be it because of my drama or for some other reason. As I said, I am trying to accept my condition, and so unleashing your anger and discontempt at me would very likely help me with that. And you surely won't be able to hate me more than I do.\n\nThank you for your attention.\n(By the way, this is NOT a suicide note in case it might sound like one.)", "subreddit": "lonely"}

Anyway, when I was a kid I was a loudmouth and a tomboy and pretty social, also a complete dunce. I had a few close friends one of them is still with me. As I got older I got into video games and learning stuff on my time through things like game theory and other fun shows, taking in history, science, not math I still suck at math. I also stopped hanging out with the friends I made, along with the fact the friends I had made didn't share much in common with me. I started hockey and found a good friend, but we didn't see each other often, but that didn't bother me much at the time. Everything was chill I got a good amount of social interaction through school, then I'd go home play some games, go to hockey, then home again.; I had no problem with it. Then I went to a boarding school, (my parents didn't ship me off, I was struggling with school, and I wanted to go anywhere that would help) My first year was okay and then everything fell apart, I accepted the fact i was trans (not gonna go into that, don't worry I'm not an SJW), halfway through my sophomore year I had to be put on anti-depressants. I had a grouop of friends, but I only hung out with them sometimes not too often because I have a really bad case of either everyone loves me, or everyone hates me and is only nice cause I'm the speacial kid. I isolated myself whenever I could, I stopped eating, not like an anorexic, I just didn't want to do anything including eat. I got to the point of being borderline suicidal, and by the end of the winter term, the school said I was a manic depressant and I couldn't be trusted to sleep on campus under the worry I'd hurt myself or off myself. I stayed with my mother off-campus. And for the rest of the year, I just kinda let myself slowly fade away. I guess one silver lining of the hell I had put myself through was I became extremely close to my parents, when you feel like a worthless piece of shit but your parents are constantly there for you, its something else, if they weren't as involved as they were I not sure how that would have played out. Now cue the beginning of my junior year, I got most of my shit together I work out 4 days a week, I do my work, but my whole friend group from last year graduated, I still have a really bad case of I'm either the messiah or I'm a pest to everyone. On the days I don't work out I feel like a piece of shit, I can't and won't open up to anyone other than my family or a therapist. When I talk to people I keep the subject always on them because if it's on me and they seem uninterested I just kinda collapse. I come off as the really smart yet angry kid, I have a very bad case of bitch face. Lifes fine but it's like 10% I'm on top of the world 60% I'm okayish 30% ahhhhhhhhhhhhh. I have no close friends up here, there are probably plenty of kids who I could get closer to but like I'm either incredibly observant or overthink things with an exponent of 10. And I get so lonely, I blow steam off in the gym but then if I wanna stay chill I cannot go back out in public or the smallest stuff will send me right back to hell. And I am so goddam lonely I just want someone I can chill with, just be able to say stuff without worrying will this ruin whatever we currently have, just a kind of unconditionaly support. I also would love a relationship but 1) when I think or figure out people like me it makes me extremely uncomfortable, the girl could be an absolute 10 but I'd run for the hills, 2) Due to the tr\\*nny(pls don't crucify me for this word I really think reclaiming words and using them casually is important) shit I am extremely uncomfortable with how I look, even though I look a lot like a dude, broad shoulders kinda deep voice, short but not like midget level, I'm actually pretty damn atractive, but I am still ya know XX on closer inspection. I'd love to have a girlfriend who I care and love unconditionally, and I am 16 so like I want to be able to get into some stuff (like hell I'm going to though till I have all the hormone and surgery shit taken care of) But like I don't do anything to go out and get one, Girlfriend or friend, doesn't help when I feel like shit all I want todo is receed into my room and fucking explode, scream cry beat the shit out of something. I'm kinda a dick to my friends, (in like a playful way) and will buy them shit then say in return they're not allowed to talk to me for a full day, (which could be perceived badly) But I'm like a Bernese mountain dog at heart (i know its normally golden retriever at heart, but I have a Bernese) if some just smiles nicely at me when we pass, I'd probably take a bullet for them. Like we have an Italian transfer kid, the dudes huge, but he's really chill and we share class, and he will answer questions I ask and overall a welcoming guy, barely talk to him but like I'd die for him (no homo) same with almost every person whos just nice to me.

One of my friends (F) is in my group, and like always we planned to pair up together. However, when our other friend (R) came along she semi-forced my planned partner to work with her. They've been friends for the longest so I didn't really say anything. F, I could tell, didn't really know what to say. She didn't want to hurt R or my feelings by choosing one over the other so she did say about us already pairing up but R insisted and F just waited to see what she could do when we started the lesson. Once we did, F asked if we could be a 3 and the teacher said that if there was no one else alone then yes. So we were a three but it doesn't end there. We were playing badminton and we had to choose between a small or larger racket. I chose a smaller one, I'm already tall enough and it's easier to co-ordinate because I don't have very good hand-eye coordination. R chose a larger one. We (me and F) told her that she should chose a smaller one but she still got the larger one. We played one game, sat down, and R took my bloody racket. She gave me her larger one. I asked her to give it back, she didn't. F asked her to give it back, she didn't. I was left with that sodding pink racket. F also had a smaller racket, but she didn't take hers, she took mine. She cares more about F than me. I felt like a piece of plastic, surrounding a nice chocolate that was just thrown away one the chocolate was eaten, like it was supposed to. Disposable. Like no one needed me. I couldn't concentrate the whole lesson, didn't know what was going on. My head was racing with those horrible deadly thoughts we get and I was holding back tears. I felt like I was gonna crack.\n\nIn retrospect, no one ever cared enough to help or support me through many things. I was bullied for 4 years, and despite the bully not being the big, scary, gonna-beat-you-up sort, no one ever really tried to stand up for me. Not that I remember anyways.

I genuinely want to die. If I told someone I know I felt that way, they'd just say same. It's not the same. It never was.\n\nI'm losing hope. What's the bloody point anymore.

The Junior Who Can't Talk to Girls", "author": "Anotherguy783", "self_text": "I've tried to block out my memories of high school due to the almost daily bullying but I do sometimes remember an incident. Maybe posting about them will be therapeutic. Most of my therapists tell me to forget about high school so I tried to but I think it damaged me more than I thought. I was a junior in high school taking chemistry. I was and still am terrible at chemistry. Not only with women but in actual chemistry. I remember I once really angered the teacher for disagreeing with her. This is not about that. This is about a group assignment.\n\nThe teacher said get into groups for a chemistry project. Of course, I couldn't find anyone to be partners with so the teacher who disliked me put me into a group that was one member short. It was two girls. One hated me and was very vocal about it. The other was my crush who I never worked up the courage to talk to her despite us being in some of the same classes for a few years. I think most of us have a crush on that one girl who we never get the courage to talk to. She wasn't stacy who was a cheerleader. She was just a regular girl. \n\nA brief tangent but one day she got on my bus to go to a friends house who lived near me. She even sat with her friend in the seat behind me and I wanted to say something so bad but I couldn't work up the nerve. It probably would have ended badly. \n\nI get into the group and the one girl who hated me was very annoyed I got assigned to her group. My crush didn't like me either but also was quiet and didn't talk much. The project was very awkward and eventually I had to ask my crush to borrow her pen because I forget to bring mine over. You would think asking someone to borrow their pen isn't a big deal. This was me and I didn't even know how to socialize with girls. It's one of the reasons I came off even weirder than I was to girls. I start panicking in my head. Eventually I blurt out I really need a pen in a panicked voice. They both look at me like I'm crazy because I was when I tried to talk to her. I couldn't even say, hey, can I borrow your pen for a second? No, I couldn't even say those words without panicking. She gave me a look of being weirded out and a surprised look since I almost shouted it. I don't remember what happened the rest of the project since I've done all I can to repress my high school memories.\n\nThe other kids who were juniors were partying, drinking, even smoking weed. That class I talked about the kids being asked what they did that weekend with those kids saying that was also during my junior year. Those same kids were sexually active. They were so far ahead of me socially. Once I fell behind in middle school, I never recovered.\n\nDo you have any stories that are similar from high school?", "subreddit": "ForeverAlone"}

Long story short, back in July I matched with this girl on tinder. We messaged sporadically, then she added me on fb a little later, and apologised as she doesn't use that app often apparently. We started messaging daily, and turns out we have some interests in common, and she seemed like an honest, intelligent, caring, (insert positive adjectives ad nauseam) person, as far as could be seen from just messaging. In short, a very good candidate for a first date, at the least. I don't have very much dating experience, since for years I struggled with social anxiety due to Asperger's and poor self esteem. I decided to give it a go this year, and went on a handful of dates, and ended up being ghosted, catfished, and with the rest, there wasn't really a connection there. \n\nThis girl seemed the most promising out of the dozens of people I've interacted with online, as far as messaging goes. I know, you cannot judge someone you haven't even met in person, but as far is reasonable to be keen to meet up with someone you met online, that's how it was in this case. She actually told me she is serious about dating, and not just using the app to screw around. She was very family-oriented, as am I. She arrived in the country this year from Europe for work, and told me she was going back in December to study for a semester, and then coming back in May to continue working here. She said she fell in love with this country, but at that point wasn't sure if she'd be able to stay, but would like to. I probably should have seen this as somewhat of a concern, but when you're keen on someone, that stuff is usually in the back of your mind. At least there was hope that the logistics of this might work out, right?\n\nI've been through some difficult times over the past few months, but most of those issues have sorted themselves out. I graduated and got a job as a software engineer, so I thought things were finally looking up. Honestly, her daily messaging really helped me get through the bad days in the past few months. I defended my thesis, and graduated, and asked her out, and was really looking at a date with her as a sort of reward for all my hard work. Whether or not it was going to work out, it's always great to meet new people, right? Well, we had set up a date, then either she or I had to cancel as things came up, about three or four times. Finally, we agreed to meet up this week. I had what I thought was a good gut feeling, like my intuition is telling me to pursue her. I felt different about this one than the rest I've talked to.\n\nI just messaged her to confirm, and she said that maybe it's not a good idea, since she's all of a sudden going back home early, and may not come back, due to some family situation. I know that she might have been telling the truth about coming back next year, since the program she is doing is divided into two halves.\n\nGenerally I don't believe in horoscopes or things of that type, but for whatever reason I decided to have a look at it recently. During difficult times, I don't really have the capacity to use reason and logic, so I turn to things like this. I was shocked by what I saw. The forecast was for a Libra (me) to meet someone, possibly a Virgo (her), and the connection would be incredibly strong, but it's not the right time for it, and we'd have to wait a good 6-8 months for it to be logistically possible, possibly due to work reasons. See how this perfectly describes the situation, as it was up until now? At least, that was the astrologer's interpretation. There were several readings like this, and the interpretations were quite similar. Others were different, but they always say to only take things that resonate with you.\n\nAstrology is bullshit. I knew this, but sometimes I can't help being drawn into it, especially in situations like these. Intuition and gut feelings are bullshit, I will never, ever trust mine again. Online dating, and dating in general is bullshit. God and the universe are playing games with me, and I don't like it. This year especially, things look better, then all of a sudden everything crashes and burns. It's not just with this girl, it's other stuff that's been going on, too. Is it really too much to ask to have someone I love, and who loves me back?", "subreddit": "ForeverAlone"}

We found out she had cancer.  \nThey tried to cure her, and we thought they had for a time, but in the end she didn\u2019t make it.  They took pieces of her out and poisoned her with chemo.  Just taking the fucking biopsies was terrible.  She was scared, but she stayed happy the whole time.  Whatever it is that let\u2019s a person do that is something you are born with.  \nHere is my point.  If you are reading this, you probably weren\u2019t born with it.  I sure as hell wasn\u2019t.  It\u2019s not your fault that you were born the way you were.  Maybe it was random chance, maybe some greater power decided, but either way fuck that, fuck him, or just generally fuck this situation.  If it\u2019s hard to be happy, get angry and be defiant.  Find the thing you are good at.  Maybe it\u2019s defiance.  Don\u2019t kill yourself.  Say fuck you, run out the clock, and keep your eyes open for good opportunities and people.  They do turn up sometimes.  It might take your whole life, but it\u2019s worth it.   If you can do that (and I know it\u2019s so hard) you have have at least one person who thinks you are brave and loves you a little bit for struggling in the dark.", "subreddit": "lonely"}

For a period of about four to five months I thought my coworker was interested in me. I don't think it was particularly unreasonable for me to have thought this, given that he was stopping to talk to me at my desk every day before he left for home, emailing me frequently to chat to me about anything, and then, later, accepted my request for drinks two times. Following *that*, he started asking *me* to drinks and *dinner* with just the two of us and was emailing me even more frequently. After each time we hung out, he would message me saying he had a nice time and thanking me for the evening. He also asked for my number and was texting me over the weekends. Further to this, he was asking me to go with him to exhibitions at art galleries (just the two of us). During all that time, he never said/asked anything sexuality-related, but you would have thought that maybe, just maybe, he would have picked up the vibe from me that that was what I was looking for, from the way I looked at him, etc, and clarified. OH, and he bought me three gifts during this period as well, including a hardback book because I'd expressed some interest in a topic a few days earlier. Well, one evening, I finally decided to ask him if he was gay, afraid that once the cat was out of the bag he would want to begin a sexual relationship with me that I wasn't sure I was ready for but forging ahead anyway. But, of course, he tells me that he's hetero. What. The. \\*\\*\\*\\*? I handled it with good grace and acted normal, asking him if he'd seen any attractive women at the company we work for. He replies that he *never* looks at women because he's \"too respectful\" - yes, really!!! He also divulged to me he'd never kissed anyone, also because he's \"too respectful\" - what an absolute cop-out for being in the closet. When I asked who he thought the best looking woman on the team was, he named IMO the most unattractive one, because he likes her jewellery!!! I just wanted to say \"thanks for wasting my time, you grade A closeted weirdo\", but instead said I was feeling a bit tired and thought it time to call it a night.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFollowing this, I obviously felt mortified and wanted to forget the whole thing. I was taking my lunch at a different time to when he normally took his for this reason. But then he started taking his lunch late like I was doing. We're talking like 45 minutes later than he would normally take it (and he was previously like clockwork, eating lunch at the same time every day). I then started going for walks outside before eating lunch so that I would be taking it even later. Then I would see him just sitting there with a hot drink, seemingly waiting for me. If I sat on the other side of the room (a patent snub) he would move his lunch over to where I was sitting, or even when he'd already eaten his lunch he would sit (or stand, if there was no chair) next to me while I ate, talking to me about drivel.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAs if this wasn't sufficiently bizarre, he has now got a girlfriend. The story behind it is basically that they were friends and then one day she told him she liked him and so from that point on they were \"together\". Literally one week before he said they were together, I'd asked him whether she was attractive and he said \"I suppose she's quite pretty\". Within about a *week* of being officially \"together\" he took her home to his parents. Now I feel like all those messages between us were a complete and utter joke. I don't even know if he is necessarily gay, but the main point is that he led me on, and that's not right.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI have since told him that the reason I asked him to drinks in the first place was because I thought there was something between us, yet he still messages me regularly. I know you're probably thinking he doesn't have other friends and that I should remain friends with him out of pity, but he does have other friends. Bottom line - this was such an odd and distressing experience and I have still come out of it with zilch. The lesson is, never try. Thank you for reading - I really needed to get that off my chest.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTL;DR coworker led me on by buying me gifts and asking me to dinner, then told me he was straight, proceeded to stalk me, and then got a girlfriend, and he still thinks we're friends despite the fact I patently go out of my way to avoid him.", "subreddit": "ForeverAlone"}

But I frequently find myself going to the NSFW subs to look at girls. And I don't want to do that, I want something real.\n\nI'm not a bad guy... I think about the environment and animals. I help out people when they need it. I like intellectual stuff (I watch a lot of documentaries). And yes, I'm a bit overweight but I'm far from ugly; in fact I'm much better looking than most guys I see around me who have girlfriends.\n\nThe worst part about my life? I'm a high school dropout without a job. I'm trying to get my life together but how long will this loneliness continue? Even I want a girl to like me, even I want to get nudes sometime. I apologize but I'm just being honest.\n\nI have tried chatting with girls on Reddit but I come on way too strong, I can't control my desperation. But I still try to chat, as normally as I possibly can.\n\nIs it a sin to for someone like me to hope for a girl to show an interest in me? I really want to know.\n\nThank you if you read all of it. I know I'm pathetic, I just wanted to let it out.", "subreddit": "lonely"}

I was a floor walker so I knew everybody there (which was a lot) and treated everybody kindly and made people laugh.

After I quit I sent some people a few messages for updates. They'd either send small replies or leave me on seen. Now 3 months out and I've come to realise not a single one of them has messaged me first or even tried to contact me at all, not even to say hi. I checked through my messages and they never even messaged first when I was working with them. Not only that, I realised that the only person besides my boyfriend that does message me at all is my friend from high school that I haven't seen in 3 years.\n\nIs there something wrong with me? Do people not like me? I don't understand, I thought if people want to be friends they'd talk to each other. I find I'm always messaging people with funny stories or conversation starters and people usually respond, but do people not find me interesting enough to not do the same with me?\n\nI've been trying to distract myself from the loneliness with projects or spending as much time with my boyfriend when he's home as I can, and I know I could message somehow to talk to them but why would I at this point? It doesn't help knowing they're not really interested.\n\nEdit: as I said, nobody else messages me besides my one friend from high school a couple times a week (mainly to talk about a bad teacher we had) and my boyfriend while on lunch at work. I have my entire family and everyone I've worked with or met at a party added and those are the only two people that seem to think about me enough to speak to me.

Being here is taking a severe toll on my mental health, and I'm not sure if it'll be worth it to transfer and actually feel something akin to joy or stay here for another year and save myself from more crippling debt later on.

But for a long time I felt something that I didn\u2019t understand, but now I do. I\u2019m alone. When I look around me and see my achievements I see what was missing, someone to share those feelings of pride with. Most of my family is gone, either dead or very far away, and my circle of friends is nonexistent. Through initial schooling I was told by my parents that \u201cSchool is for learning and furthering your growth, not socializing.\u201d I carried that maxim through all of my other schooling as well, and focused solely on grades and my extracurricular activities. I was surrounded by people, and in some cases I worked with them, but I never really interacted with them. I carried that endowed maxim with me up until my parents died and I began on a part of my path that is largely a waiting game. Then I realized that I missed out on a key part of my growth through schooling, socialization. And what\u2019s worse, I\u2019m not that old. I\u2019m 23, and I just missed my opportunity. The door has just slammed shut behind me, and there\u2019s no way to turn back. I started to talk to some people who I used to go to school with. Some of them said that they would\u2019ve offered for me to hang out with them, but I seemed preoccupied or disinterested. But worst of all, a girl who I actually enjoyed hanging around and who I thought of asking out, but didn\u2019t because of my parents disapproval, confessed that she did have feelings for me. But now she\u2019s married. I cried. After those exchanges I started to try and go out with some people I work with after our shifts to try and learn socialization skills by proxy, but it didn\u2019t work. Every time that I tried to engage a stranger in conversation I either, faltered, embarrassed myself, or just gave up. After many months of this I realized how truly clueless I was in that realm. I realized that I\u2019m part of a growing group of people who only speak to others through the internet in extremely shallow, unthoughtful conversations.

He *never* gave a fuck; whether genetically blessed or because he's some freak of nature, this dude - and kudos to him! - was blessed with a giant set of psychopathic balls from the beginning.\n\nFortunately, he doesn't actually give specifics on how not to give a fuck, so it's a moot point.\n\n**Among the author's major regrets are that he didn't treat his friends and succession of girlfriends well.**\n\nNow isn't that useful information for those of us in this forum?\n\n**\"Solving problems is the source of happiness.\"**\n\nSure, if you say so buddy.

How does this help those of us struggling with loneliness? ...  Okay then!\n\n**Heavens to Zeus, why do people recommend this awful book?**\n\nI don't necessarily blame the author - he is kind of fascinating, and if his bio is to be believed, quite accomplished in life and business.  The book is sort of an extended, evidence-free rant on how he came to stoicism and his self-congratulatory macho life ethic.\n\nBut how clueless do people have to be to recommend this book, to people in this forum?", "subreddit": "ForeverAlone"}

I got really into Christianity and into symbolism, kept smoking the weed and mixed those two which I think was a big time no-no. I'd broken up with a girl and it broke my heart and I never real recovered and back in July I told myself God would be cool with me sleeping with a gal, just to relieve stress, just to have some fun, and we met on tinder and it was all cool until I realized it didn't fill the hole and instead it totally broke me and now the guilt is too much and I feel cut off from God and Life altogether and I dunno if I can enjoy anything.

She cheated on my best friend, she was going from guy to guy every month (not for sex but emotional reasons) and I was not physically attracted to her. \n\nSo everytime she tried to make an advance I basically pushed her away. Anyways when the school year started she dated another guy for a month and then she ended up dating this sophomore guy and they have been dating for the last year and 1 month. (While she was a senior) \n\nSo basically as I started hanging out with her more as friends and what have you I started becoming more and more attracted to her. She also was staying loyal to her boyfriend which showed me she could actually hold a long term boyfriend. Basically throughout the whole year the regret of not dating her built up every month up to where I am today where I am ready to kill myself.\n\nNow during this time during the first 6 months of there relationship they broke up 4 or 5 times. But the other 6 months they haven\u2019t. I recently told her last month how I felt about her and she told me that \u201chey if me and Jim don\u2019t workout it\u2019s me and you\u201d pointing to both me and her. She also later on during us hanging out that day told me that I am her favorite person and she doesn\u2019t just say that to anyone and she says she literally means that. I don\u2019t know how true that is considering the fact she is still with her boyfriend. \n\nAnyways the next 3 years she is still going to be in the area because she is spending this year taking a year off school and then the next 2 years she will be going to a school 45 minutes away. Now after her first year at college her boyfriend will then graduate college and knowing how smart he is will probably go to that college in Hawaii he wants to go to or some where far away. He has already told her that if he moves or she moves to far away from college he will end the relationship. Which makes her very upset. My question is based off this information is it worth sticking around these next 3 years or is there relationship not going to end? Like what are my chances here because I am trying to decide if it\u2019s worth continuing this hell everyday or ending this shit? If you could please answer these questions and NOT if I should move on or don\u2019t do it type answers that would be really appreciated. Thanks\n\nEDIT: Please just answer the question and don\u2019t tell me to move on or life is worth it\n\nEDIT 2: Also when Jim did a ama on Snapchat someone asked: how often do you and Sarah break up? And he said dam well twice but we are good for right now (So maybe the 4-5 thing is wrong but that\u2019s what I heard and I guess the person asking the question thought the same thing)", "subreddit": "lonely"}

She has gorgeous greenish blue eyes, dirty blonde hair, and a really cute smile. She has the perfect ass, oh my god. Not too big, not too small, just in the middle. Like a nice bulge sticking out. I think she caught me staring, and she winked at me. My heart went rapid. I was finally noticed by a woman! And a super hot one at that! My heart was going so fast I felt like I was gonna fucking faint. I got up. \"G-guys, I need to go to the bathroom\" They all gave me the nod. Except Shantel. She was staring right at me and smiling. To prevent myself from reciprocating the staring I quickly ran to the bathroom to make it a bit less awkward. There was this big hall where the bathroom was. When I went into the restroom I splashed some water on my face. I tried to calm myself down but I was so fking excited. I said \"fuck it\" and just decided to see where things went from here. I was a virgin and I never even had a girlfriend so that's why I was so excited. Anyway I left the bathroom. Just as I was leaving the hall I saw Shantel right there and she grabbed my cheeks and kissed me. I could taste her lipstick. God it was fucking amazing. I had a massive boner right there. I didn't know what to do further so I just kept kissing her. It lasted a good couple minutes and then she just left with something in my hand. It was her number. :)\n\nAnyway we left and then a couple days later I invited her to this spot on the beach to just have some lunch. Weird thing to do I know. The reason I invited her to that specific spot was because it was quiet and there was absolutely no one there for miles. Anyways she came and it was the best day ever. While we were sipping wine and talking about friendships, hobbies and other stuff, she asked me to take a picture for her. I didn't hesitate and snapped the photo. She was in a thong pressed up against a palm tree on her front. She wanted me to take a picture of her backside. She asked me to hand her the phone. I did and then she pulled me in closer and started to kiss me. She grabbed my ass and turned around and rubbed her butt on my crotch. She kept doing it in a circular motion. She put her hands on my groin and stroked it through my boxers. Then she took off her top and put my hands on her breasts. I kept rubbing her breasts while kissing her. Then she handed me a condom (she came prepared haha) and we went at it.\n\nJust then I woke up.\n\n\"Fuck\" I said.\n\n\"Still a virgin.\"", "subreddit": "ForeverAlone"}

The link I\u2019ve provided has one of my journal entries from October 2003, just two months before I left for USMC recruit training. I also included a pic of me in high school, one during my time in the Corps, and present day. \n\nIt is my hope that some of you will see this and feel inspired to find whatever it is you\u2019re looking for. I\u2019ll close with this: \n\nI wallowed in misery for a long, long time, and the only thing and the only person who could change this was me. I grew up in an unstable, volatile household ran by two alcoholic parents with a penchant for cocaine (mom). Food was scarce, and unconditional love and support nearly non-existent. After being academically suspended from college for a year (just didn't go to class, too depressed), I spent the next 11 months working dead-end jobs and feeling sorry for myself. It was pathetic. \n\nThere wasn't a singular moment that did it, but one day I simply woke up, realized things would not change unless I tried, and decided to act. Met with military recruiters from every branch, but for me the decision was easy. While every other recruiter tried selling me on benefits (free college, travel, health insurance, etc.), the Marine I met said this: \"I'm not going to promise you anything, but I will tell you this: we'll make a man out of you.\" \n\nI was sold.  \n\nIn closing, I want to stress this: nobody would save me - I had to save myself. Nobody will save you - you have to save yourself. Do the work, stop making excuses. \n\nI could (and have contemplated) write a book on my life and this topic, but will refrain for now.

Why do they consider themselves or desire to be considered weird.  \n\nI'm thinking they view \"weird\" as a synonym for unique or quirky.  The issue is that there are direct, measurable consequences to *actually* being considered weird by your peers. The bullying, the isolation, watching your peers live their lives from the outside looking in, the lunches spent eating alone, the looks of discomfort people give when speaking with you, the new guy on the team who has left a larger mark/impression after a month than you've been able to after years, etc... \n\nActively desiring to be considered weird is actively desiring all of that... and I don't think most people realize that.  They haven't lived that life and I'm willing to bet a lot of us have.  What's funny is that when 99% of the population answers \"weird\" to this, it effectively becomes the new normal.  Selecting normal is going against the grain, and thus being weird [presumably by their definitions].  Naturally, reactions are negative.  \n\nI know that this is a million times more thought than most people put into the question and it really isn't a big deal, but I found it interesting to write about.  What are your thoughts?", "subreddit": "ForeverAlone"}

But my ugly, ethnic, socially awkward ass had no idea how to interact with a woman. But I was tired of seeing tits on a computer screen, I wanted to see them in real life. So I went to a strip club and paid for a lap dance. I saw, and touched, boobs for the first ever time.\n\nI didn't go weekly (thank goodness), it was a \"once every month or two\" kind of thing. Physically, it felt nice. But emotionally, it does nothing. There's no validation, there's no emotion. This girl is only doing this because you're paying her. And that, to me, robs 99% of the electricity. \n\nHowever, the 1% was still nice enough that every two months I'd say \"hey I'd like to fondle some tits\" and I'd go to a club. I'd know the emotional intimacy wasn't there, but the physical intimacy was. \n\nFast forward to age 24. I've gone to various strip clubs and had hundreds of lap dances from various women. At 23 I \"upgraded\" to brothels. I've done an array of sexual experiences; sucking breasts, fingering vaginas, receiving oral, cuddling, making out, etc.\n\nI did no PIV sex, though. I'm still holding out on the hope that I want my first-ever \"sex\" to be sincere and unpaid. \n\nAnyway, now I'm 100% burnt out on paying for intimacy. The physical appeal is all gone. I don't give a flying fuck about paying a hooker to suck her tits or something. \n\nI want to go on a date, I want to feel the validation that comes with it. The fact that a girl finds me interesting and attractive enough to voluntarily spend time with me. THAT is x10000 more exciting than a quick handjob from a sex-worker. \n\nAnd if it leads to a kiss and then more physical intimacy, I'll have escaped FA. Christ.\n\n**TL;DR**\n\nLonely dude lived his entire life without emotional intimacy. Tries to \"fill the void\" of physical intimacy by paying for it every now and then. It kind of numbs the pain, but it's a painkiller and not true healing. Several years in, paying for it no longer has any effect. What little effect it had is all gone. And he wants the real thing. There is no substitute for the real thing.\n\nAnd to all the normies that tell us \"just hire a hooker bro!\", eat shit.", "subreddit": "ForeverAlone"}

I want acceptance, the truest kind, that is what would fulfill my desire to belong. I want to know I am genuinely cared about. \n\nSo I do something that makes me feel accepted. Something I can only do when I\u2019m alone. I connect to myself. My favorite, most fulfilling ways to do this is to either drive around, or go on a walk. I love the colors on the trees in fall, and the feel of crunching leaves underneath.  I love the thrill of walking across a frozen lake. I love discovering new hidden places that maybe one day I can show to a special someone, so I could share with them the gift of acceptance I have made for myself. \n\nI talk out loud. To my car. To the clouds. But especially to a tree. Trees are alive. They listen. And they always appreciate a hug. Who cares if this makes me look crazy, I am alone after all.\n\nAnd finally, I make myself feel cared for. I carefully pack a lunch that I imagine only a caring parent or partner could perfect.

You go to the gym and lose a lot of weight, you get ripped. You get a new style, you do all of those things. Fast forward, say, a year and all of a sudden you do get some interest from girls (or guys, whichever way you roll). However... you didn't really change on the inside, right? You're still the same person. You still do have the same dreams, hopes, fears, interests, values, all of that. \n\nSo here's the kicker: whenever someone is interested in you now, you know for a fact it's not because of *you*. You gain direct proof of that. The \"raw\" version of you didn't get any interest whatsoever, but now that you lost some weight and changed your style, or maybe took up a new hobby, that suddenly changes? How so? What other conclusion to draw from this other than all of that being just fake because it's obviously not actually about you as a person? It's basically just superficial BS.

{"post_id": "dj8cca", "created_utc": 1571327728, "title": "Alone.", "author": "TardisCatTwo", "self_text": "I've been lonely practically all my life. I've had few friends my whole life, and only now have I begun to have some roleplay buddies that I can at least somewhat consider to be 'friends'. But even then I still feel lonely. I don't go out with friends anymore, and even when I am around friends I'm still lonely. Some would call me a recluse, while others would call me an attempted and failed comedian. Neither viewpoints are wrong, per say. But I'll explain that later. Although I've been lonely my whole life, I haven't been had the same viewpoint on  my loneliness for all these years. In my early years, back when there was recess, I would spend my time at recess either looking for four leaf clovers, or, on my lucky days, I would play with my few friends (of which I've had a falling out with since). I was lonely, yes, but I didn't really think much of it. I wasn't all too upset about it, I was just accepting of it and didn't really think it wasn't normal. I've also realized that my reasons for not having many friends have actually changed over the years. When I was younger, back when there was recess, I didn't have many friends because I was too zany, clingy, didn't understand the concept of personal space AT ALL, etc. This was because, of course, I was a kid and almost all kids are wild like this. But it was also because I have ADHD and Autism, the latter of which wasn't discovered until much later. I also have an Anxiety Disorder, but this didn't really affect my behaviour when I was so young. Anyway, onto the rest of my past. So, I didn't have much friends because I was nuts, although I did get more calm after I started taking medication for my ADHD. Flash forward to when I was about \\[blank\\]. I was still kinda nuts, of course, but that was about when my reasons for being lonely started to shift. I began to be outcast less for my behaviour (although that was still a reason for me being outcast, just not as much), and more for my intelligence. Now, up until this point, I had still managed to stay cheery and keep a positive attitude about things. This didn't change right away, mind you, but it did eventually change. When I was \\[blank\\], though, I did begin to change my looks a bit. I began to pave the road toward my present day signature haircut, and I was proud of my new look. The next school year was one of the better ones, I kept my reputation of getting practically perfect grades and was actually relatively popular for a short period of time. I was also dedicated to trying to help others, and I kept my cheery attitude even despite the family dog (which we'd had as long as I could remember) passing away. My \\[blank\\] birthday, though, was when things began to change. I was asked out by my same sex crush, and of course I accepted. The school year that followed started off as one filled with me daydreaming about my partner, but I failed to take the fact that we went to different schools into consideration. My partner ended up cheating on me with one of the very people that were there when my partner had asked me out. This is where my viewpoint on things slowly began to change. I did end up joining the theater club and getting another same sex partner. This relationship didn't last all too long, sadly. This was due to peers threatening to take me away from my partner, which, understandably, my partner couldn't handle. This resulted in the breakup, which I don't blame my partner for in any way. I blame the people who made the threats that drove my partner to breaking up with me in tears. Of course I comforted my partner, because what friend would I be if I didn't? The next year was when my change of viewpoint began to show. Over the summer between school years, I got a partner of opposite sex after being asked out by them. I reluctantly accepted and became their partner, of course. Unlike my first same sex partner, my OSP1 (Opposite Sex Partner 1) and I were able to actually keep in touch despite us going to different schools. Things started off fine, but my OSP1 slowly stopped responding to my messages. I soon found out that my OSP1 had been cheating, yet despite this, I agreed to get back together with them. I later found out that my OSP1 viewed the people of my gender as playthings, and that my OSP1 viewed love as some sort of silly game. I left my OSP1 and moved on. Well, or so I thought. I couldn't forget about OSP1, no matter how hard I tried. over the course of the school year that followed that summer break, I started to become depressed. My grade began to go down, and I even cut myself. Fast forward to closer to today, when one of my closest friends asked me out. I was reluctant to accept, considering how I initially thought it was some sort of prank. I eventually accepted, though, making that friend OSP2. Things were good, I felt loved. That is, until OSP2 seemed to stop showing interest in me. OSP2 later dumped me, but claimed that they were still there for emotional support. And yet, they don't respond to my messages and don't even really seem to care. They even claimed that ***I*** had dumped ***them*** when texting a friend of mine. I've since been lonelier than before, and I've been secluding myself from society irl and trying to cover up my sadness with sarcasm and snarky jokes.", "subreddit": "lonely"}

I do the best I can to help them emotionally but it takes a toll on me. \n\nAbout 2 weeks ago, I found out my dad called himself into the hospital, apparently he thought he was having a heart attack.

I decided to spend it on the beach. I thought it would be a nice \"reunion\" party because although we talk to each other almost every day group meetings became a rare thing. Nothing like 5 good old budies playing volleyball and swimming I thought. The day arrived and the number became 9 instead of 5 since all of them took their girlfriends. Of course I know that they are in the relationships, some of them for more than a year and some of them became a friend of mine as well but I somehow still didn't realise the situation I'm about to enter. I'm pretty soft and chill with this stuff and I just say yes to the requests of bringing their SO to the party. So it's time to go for swimming and all of the sudden after 5 minutes I realised that there's no one near me. I turned around and saw 4 couples enjoying each others company and this just crushed me. It already felt a little weird but that image just completely destroyed me. I tried my best to not show it and to not ruin the party for them too. It was even worse since it was my birthday. I don't blame them of course, all of them are extremely kind and good people and they didn't have bad intentions for sure but that evening I was sitting in my room full of thought.

That spells bad news for women looking for committment and really bad news for guys who are average and below looking for, well, *anything.*\n\nA few caveats: this article is from a lad magazine (and not a particularly tasteful or good one).  And the 'insider' it is quoting is an anonymous person who provides no proof that this is actually true.  The reason I share this is because what is being disclosed here definitely tracks with actual data coming from places openly disclosed by OKCupid showing how men and women behave on dating sites.

All my life I've had issues with depression and loneliness and it's only just recently that I've started to handle things better. For a long time my life was a goddamn train wreck and it took every ounce of strength I had to drag myself out of the muck to get to where I am where I'm somewhat stable and am doing better.\n\nBut I'd be lying if I said I stopped being depressed and lonely. \n\nI just got good at handling it. After drugs and therapy didn't work and nearly killing myself I was lucky to find healthy methods that worked for me. But even on good days it can be a struggle.

The people here are just... pretentious. It's infuriating because every time I try to get out of my comfort zone and try something new it's a goddamn failure. For example, I'm a writer so I tried joining the one and only writing club I could find in my town and it was led by a woman who insisted on making everything about her political beliefs, and everyone was basically like her and they just wanted an echo chamber to make themselves feel good, despite the group not being described as such when I first found it. And really that's the same with every club, group, night course, and goddamn shindig I've ever tried to join in this godforsaken joke of a town. Everyone just has this ridiculous sense of superiority and entitlement that's neither earned nor is it endearing.  There is no place for a guy like me who just wants to have fun and be creative and maybe find some friends or someone more to share interests with.\n\nAnd now my new job has me on a schedule that basically makes it impossible for me to socialize with anyone since I work weird, and often long, hours and am always working weekends. It's now difficult to hang out with the one and only friend I do have. And all I have to possibly look forward to is saving up money and moving away to hopefully start somewhere better and get a fresh start. But in the mean time I'm stuck here and I still struggle with deep feelings of loneliness and worthlessness.\n\ntl;dr - I feel like the only sane man in an insane town and I can't find anyone to make this horrible feeling in my soul go away even after learning to manage my issues in healthy ways.", "subreddit": "lonely"}

Therefore I have gone through my life to pinpoint where exactly things started to go wrong and eventually I was sucked into a cascade of cause and effect that originated all the way to when I was probably somewhere around 5 or 6. Be wary that this might be a long read but if you have the time or you have gone through the same thing, this might be very helpful to you.\n\nSo first a little bit about where I am in life right now. I am a 21 year old male, in my first year of grad school. I have very few friends, only one which I see nearly daily. I have always felt like an outsider ever since I can remember. To be honest, I was severely introverted so I never considering social activity something I needed in my life, but I have made a grave mistake thinking that way, because it turns out I do. Since elementary I had trouble making friends. I skipped one of the earlier years in elementary (sorry IDK the English name) and was placed in a class full of unknown but seemingly 'more adult' people. Not only that, but I was born right after the summer so I didn't have to do the first year twice, so I was already 1 year younger than the rest. Now I was 2 years younger, and that age difference is really REALLY noticable when you're about 5. Socially, I was was behind the rest. I was the weird kid who imagined fighting dragons on the playground and it turned a lot of people away. One of the cringiest moments I can think of is how a girl I hardly knew was inviting girl friends over for her birthday party and I broke out crying because I had never been invited to a party myself. She pity invited me later and I did say some cringy stuff during the party itself. I am not quite sure what any more but I do remember it. I had a crush that I kept chasing who would reject me from time to time again in evermore harsh ways. Perhaps middle school would be better?\n\nBut it didn't. I kept the weird characteristics of mine and took them to middle school, albeit in a somewhat more moderate fashion because I realised puberty was around the corner and I needed to ditch some stuff that was perceived as weird. Things I did: I rushed to grab the door knob first every hour, I always boasted about how I LOVED studying, I lobbied for more homework and less vacation... you name it. I do not know why I used to be that way honestly, except that I can guess that I had always been raised by the notion that studying and excellence is the highest form of achievement in life, fueled by the fact that I was ahead of everyone else by skipping a grade. At the end of the 2nd year in middle school, I began to notice the effects of my behaviour. I was 11 and the rest was 13-14, and they disliked me severely. Really, I felt something missing, namely friends. Even a girlfriend. I started to become romantically interested the year after, and I seriously fell for this one girl in my Spanish class. She was way out of my league and no way a socially inept loner like me could ever have a chance with her. Up to this day she remains my only strong crush. (Elementary doens't count!!) How I wish to fall for someone again...\n\nThen high school came and honestly I cannot say that I improved massively. I knew how to talk to people, I was invited for parties and dinners. It was definitely far from perfect though. Still, I was this massive nice guy / good boy I was raised to be. This means that I never stepped out of my comfort zone, I never dared to break any rules, I never went crazy; I just conformed to the 'good boy teachers liked' type. And honestly, this is all I remember about high school. It was not memorable to me. I didn't have any crazy moments to look back on. I do remember always being chosen last in PE and once I burst into tears without empathy from the teacher. These jocks always chose the girls to be in their football team over me despite them being scared of the ball. I sucked at football, but still, they did this to break me as they laughed in my face. I also remember feeling romantically overlooked. This girl I talked about earlier, I crushed hard on her for 4 years and some friends started to notice despite me never being transparent about it. I eventually admitted it and they tried helping me but I told them not to in order to avoid embarassment. To me, rejection was the greatest pain imaginable. And up to this day, it still is.\n\nThen undergrad came and this had to be the moment, right? I finally learned how to behave like a proper human being and whatnot, but still it didn't work. I still lived at home and took the train everyday, so I missed out on about anything people remember university for but studying. I didn't go to the introduction week which is honestly a death sentence for socializing. I missed out on all campus parties, on all trips, on dorm nights, on everything. It never really bothered me until like 2 years ago. I was about to turn 20, and I suddenly felt that feeling creep up on me that my youth passed me by without me ever grabbing a chance. I have nothing to look back on. Not a first kiss, not the first time I was drunk, not that time I went out with friends to the funfair or carnival. It was dull and I was dull, and it's gone forever. I will never ever get these years back. I missed out on core human experiences. I talked about this with Discord friends and they all got laid by 18 and whatnot so my situation was foreign to me.\n\nAnd do you know what the source of this all is? Skipping that damn grade. Maybe if I didn't do it I wouldn't have this superiority complex with me telling me that this is my life's greatest achievement and that I should put all my focus on it. I wouldn't have to feel special and maybe I could have worked on my social skills then by interacting with my class mates instead. But another important thing, I would have been of the same age as the rest. Honestly, development goes so fast when you're so young that our age difference put me far behind everybody else. This made people less likely to interact with me, which gave me an even greater disadvantage. And this process diverges; it is a self-fullfilling prophecy. The less I interacted with others, the harder it became. The harder it became, the less I interacted with others. In high school I still had the social skills of a potato because I never learnt in a natural fashion how to behave. Eventually I had to resort to online forums and YouTube to learn it all, and it saddens me that such an integral part of life wasn't taught to me naturally but artifically. So my life has basically been trying to catch up in a race where you're so far behind it's impossible to win.\n\nAnd now, I am 21. I have never kissed a girl (or had sex, duh). I don't know what a relationship even entails. I never hung out with friends really. So I have grown boring and superficial. I have always focused on myself for my entire life but it didn't give me any sense of satisfaction as I realised I needed others in my life badly.\n\nPeople tell me I am actually oblivious to girls flirting with me. TBH, I wouldn't know, because I easily mistake friendliness for flirting, and I dissmiss actual hints for mere coincidences. I did have girls approach me a few times and I even rejected some, but to me it didn't feel like anything special and I still wallowed in selfpity how unlikeable I feel.\n\nI also regret not doing things. I regret not kissing that cute redhead on that camping in France 4 years ago. I regret not putting myself out there when I was invited to parties but social anxiety kicked in. I regret not approaching that cute girl in the bus last week who smiled at me. My life is full of regret. How am I supposed to continue life as usual when there is such a heavy load on my back?\n\nI might just have undiagnosed autism or Asperger's and I have never known?

I start to get an attitude towards women (I get this irrational thought that every woman whether she looks like a supermodel or the love child of a troll and a walrus) WILL do this to me once I show signs of liking them back. I'm very cold with waitresses, bank tellers, cashiers literally any female. Even if they greet with a huge smile and come off as friendly as possible I keep a straight face, don't even show the slightest inkling of what resembles a smile and give quick to the point answers. If they try to make a joke about something I just smirk ever so slightly. If they try to engage in small talk I act like I'm not listening or couldn't give any less of a fuck of what they have to say. This is temporary and might only last a couple hours or so and then I'm (kinda) back to normal by the next day.\n\nEarlier today, I was in one of these moods and went out to eat with a buddy. We had a pretty attractive waitress with that look that says, \"yeah I've lead guys on, manipulated them, fucked them over but I don't care thats life...btw my 'boyfriend' who I'd take a bullet for also beats the shit out of me, verbally abuses me, steals money from me and cheats on me with my friends.\" \n\nNow my friends not very attractive but hes already married and doesn't really care to hit on girls. The waitress was very charistmatic and generally pretty upbeat. She came, brought us waters and took our orders. My friends asking her questions about some of the items on the menu and shes laughing with him, touching his arm, you know all the fake shit waitresses do in hopes of increasing their tip. Well before she can even finish saying, \"and for....\" without even looking at her or smiling I just blirt out my order...\"would you like fries with...\" \"NO\" \"it comes with a side of soup or sala\" \"SALAD\" \"any ranch or blue chee\" \"NO\"......\"alrighty Ill go ahead and put that in it should be out shortly.\" She kept refilling my friends pop and making small talk with him. Almost an hour later I'm getting extremely frustrated because I'm starving and her distracting us with her \"positive friendly\" attitude was getting old FAST. The last time she comes back my friend (who is a lot more patient than I am) asks about a tattoo on her arm. It was a name with a date that was decorated with angels and wings and shit. It was her friend that lost her battle with cancer and she started going into depth of what happened, how long they've known each other, etc. I almost started to feel kinda bad, but that irrational evil side of me remembers a time where my uncle passed away who I was very close with and my (much more well-liked and more successful cousin) who barely spent time with him got most of the sympathy and comforting from all the guests that came that knew both of us. I instantly snapped and yelled out, \"CAN YOU JUST CHECK ON OUR FUCKING FOOD ALREADY?? WEVE BEEN HERE AN HOUR!!\" Her face got pale and she looked as if she was going to call me out but once she saw the look of rage and intensity in my eyes, she swallowed her pride, pursed her lips and walked away. She came back with our food a few minutes later with some very teary eyes and didn't say a word. A few minutes later the manager came, and actually APOLOGIZED for taking so long and said everything was on the house (our bill would've only came out to about $20 or so. It was at that point I felt kinda bad, and left a $20 tip for her.\n\ntl;dr past frustrations with women combined with being hangry caused me to snap on a waitress when she was talking about something emotional and I felt horrible afterwards.", "subreddit": "ForeverAlone"}

Mostly from abuse. It went on for years. I'm not stuck in anything abusive anymore, but the trauma is obviously still there. I never had a safe place. School was unsafe, home was unsafe, I had nowhere else to go. So my mind was pretty dark. I got used to talking down on myself. After hearing nothing but negative things about yourself your entire life, you believe that and nothing else. I have no confidence,  no self esteem, no self-love. I've wanted to off myself for a long time, but I have people in this world that care about me. And they are literally the only reason I haven't done anything yet. I can't bring myself to cause that pain to the few people who care about me. And for them, I've continued to suffer in this deep, dark pit of despair and solitude. I'm tired of feeling like this. I'm tired of being alone.. I've never been in a relationship,  despite how big of a heart I know I have. Nobody wants this defect. I've come to the realization that I HAVE to change how I think of myself before anyone wants to even consider spending, or, sharing their life with me. But I've got so many problems and no confidence that I don't think I can fix this by myself. I don't think I can love myself until Im shown that I'm even capable of being loved. Because I feel so invisible in this world. So I've doomed myself to an eternity of being alone because I'm too messed up for anybody to want me. I found a woman whose smile ignites something in my heart that I didn't know would ever see light.. Her smile and her eyes literally takes away all of my worries. When I look into her eyes, I get lost in this beautiful hazel sea. Who would've thought that being lost at sea would feel so comforting. Everytime I look at her eyes, I see all of the pain she's endured. I see how caring she is. Because no matter how rough of a life she's had, I've never seen such a soft, beautiful set of eyes in my life. I'd literally give my life to see her smile... I don't know why, but for the past 3 months, she has been in every single dream of mine. Shes the last thing on my mind before sleep and the first one on my mind upon waking. I can't get her out of my head.. But I accidentally hurt her feelings because I dont know when to shut up.. She's been going through a lot and I've tried with everything I have to make her feel better. Regardless of my own consequences regarding my own life. Emotionally, it kills me because I know that I don't deserve her and I know that she doesn't like me back.. Everytime I see her is bittersweet. I've helped her financially a little bit too. Because she really needed help. I helped with no hesitation.  And I'd do it again. But my own financial life is struggling desperately.  But I don't care about that. I don't care if I drown as long as her head is above the water. She doesn't know about how much I'm struggling. I don't intend on telling her. I don't want her to blame herself or anything.. I did all of it by my choice. And I'd do it again. But she hasn't talked to me lately because I hurt her feelings. She didn't want to talk about something, I spoke anyway, ended up being wrong. I'm an idiot. I wish I had better social skills. I wish I wasn't so awkward. I wish I had confidence. I wish I wish I wish. I wish I wasn't stuck in this hopeless life... Even though I believe she saved it, just by being herself.. I've yet to face the harsh reality that she's going to leave me in the dust someday where I belong. While she's going to move forward and do great things.. And I hope she does. If I could, I'd be there every step of the way to support her. But I'm a trainwreck... And I'd only bring her down, like I already have. This most recent situation alone has crushed me... Everytime she stops talking to me I feel like I ruined everything and she'll never talk to me again. Even though she does. Because despite how stupid I am, she's too caring.. I like to think that, anyway.. But she doesn't care in the way I wish she did.. Never will.  But hey, you get what you get and you don't throw a fit, right? Well I wish I got a chance to end this life and start a new one. Preferably one that's not as defective. I just want to see her happy. Regardless of how much it will hurt me to see her happy without me.. I could talk about her so much I could fill pages. But I'm no author. I'm just a forever alone, defective human that's brought this pain on himself for getting too easily attached to someone who will never feel the same.. Its not the first time it's happened. But it is definitely the first time someone has ever made me feel like this. She's the biggest reason I won't do anything to end myself. But honestly, I wish something else would happen. Car crash, mugged, I don't care. I want something to happen to me. Take me out of this world in a way that nobody can blame me for.. Rant over. If anybody took the time to read all of that, thank you. From the bottom of my heart. I know it was long and I'm not very good at this sometimes. There's a lot more to it than what I said. A lot more problems, reasons I'm like this. But she's the biggest reason..", "subreddit": "ForeverAlone"}

{"post_id": "djyqkf", "created_utc": 1571457982, "title": "took a MAJOR L today y'all", "author": "Transpurge", "self_text": "So about 2 months ago, a friend of mine started a group chat with about 10 of his friends (including me) because he was trying to have a party. The party never happened, but that's not relevant. The group chat however, still stayed active because everyone was having fun talking to each other. I was also pretty active in the group chat, and people seemed to actually kind've liked me in there. The chat was about 50/50 girls and guys, but this one girl seemed to at least somewhat like me. She would always reply to me in the chat even when the topic changed, liked all my messages, and was pretty nice to me. We were talking basically every day in this chat, and as you can imagine I was really enjoying it. It was nice to be away from my phone for an hour then come back to messages all the time, it was nice to be able to say little things about my day and life, and it was cool to get to know people. Unfortunately though, about a week ago, some drama between two people in the chat started and about half the people left, and the chat has been dead for days. It made me realize how much I missed talking in the chat, and with the one girl I mentioned before especially. So today I decided to do something pretty ballsy and message her outside of the gc. I was pretty straightforward, and I said something the lines of \"I miss talking to you in the gc. How's everything going?\" A little later she replied with nothing else but the good old classic \"i have a boyfriend\". I replied that I didn't mean to come off like that, and I just wanted to be friends (which I'll admit is only half true lmao) but as you can expect, she left me on seen and did not reply. This really caught me off guard, because she really has been super nice and talkative to me over the past two months. I was talking to my friend who started the group chat and was pretty close with the girl about it as it was happening, and after laughing at how shitty my life is for a few minutes, he mentioned that he was also surprised she would say that, as she is usually super nice to everyone and he has no idea what got into her. But, ready for the real kicker? She doesn't even have a boyfriend. And she complains how she wants a boyfriend all the time (even did it to me). Not being entitled here, I know its okay for someone to have standards, but I mean come on is she really gonna shut down the guy she's been getting along with perfectly fine with the past 2 months for no apparent reason? Oh well, Ig I just have that effect on women, it's always been that way and I don't see it changing any time soon. \n\nTL;DR: Been talking to girl for a few months in a group chat, got decently close with her, group chat died, missed talking to her, tried talking to her outside of gc, and got instantly shot down and lied to by her saying she had a boyfriend when she didn't.\n\nHope everyone here is having an at least somewhat okay night!", "subreddit": "ForeverAlone"}

It's like life just changed so much in a flick of a switch. I go from being with close friends, playing splitscreen Halo to being sad and lonely with so much stress. I've never thought I'd be spacing out so much in class. I've been through trauma in elementary but I still had very close friends to be with. All the bullies are gone now(my school is 100% bully free zone) which is great. But I've never been so desperate for love and friends. I've missed them so much. My teacher even caught me spacing out and I was making eye contact at the table and my lips were moving like I was talking to someone. I remember the bullies when they used to kick me around simply for being Asian. I wasn't even messing with them. I've gotten beat up multiple times. And middle school is literally jail. I've looked at prison and they both look like the same thing. So much work and stress, not even thriving for success but instead just trying to pass. I don't get it. Why do we have to go through all this? Why does anyone have to experience such bullshit. I've gotten PTSD from the beatings. My dad also was a crazy guy. He would slap me or get a damn wooden stick and smack the shit out of my leg. I was bleeding once. I LITERALLY cried every night since I was 8. Every day I had an arguement with my dad over the most dumbest shit. I don't know if I could hold all the pain in much longer. I've thought of suicide but never attempted. Like I just feel like choking someone to death, or beating up 10 people at once, and screaming. I always had thoughts of going insane and hurting people. I seem to be so worried about so many things, even walking. I try to be consistent and place each foot down forward. I look at everything around me and think about every possible little detail about this and that. I don't know if I'm nosy or just curious. I have this crush on a freshman but I just don't know how to approach her. I don't know how to make friends anymore.

I used to spend most of my free time on videogames when I was younger (10 - 13 years old). I just enjoyed playing Nintendo games, CSGO, Minecraft, GTA V, Garry's mod... My friends and I never got bored. And even when all my friends were out in summer for weeks, I was still able to enjoy playing singleplayer games and match-making games.\n\nNow I have more occupations and so less time to play videogames. However, I don't enjoy videogames now more than before. Quite the contrary in fact. I have the feeling that now I only see videogames as a way of spending time with friends. The problem is that most of my friends now rarely want to play with me. And it's not that we have a worse relationship than before (at least I don't think so). They either have other hobbies or play a different kind of games, in which case they never make an effort to play with me.\n\nAs a result, now videogames make me feel very lonely from time to time and I have a quite pessimistic vision of them. \n\n(Sorry if the text feels like a weird semi-formal essay.

No bad body odor, and the hair on the top of my head thinned-out so it's a super short buzz cut. My typical outfit is an office style (not sport) polo and jeans.\n\nImprove myself: work in progress. I'm currently pursuing my masters in mechanical engineering. In the past I've competed internationally for design projects (travel at the school's expense is pretty nice). I've also done things outside of that like learning guitar (not in a long while, but I still have some of the music I wrote) and learning a second language (not fluent yet, the native speaker I was going to practice with graduated, but it's enough to listen to YouTube videos with some basic interaction and thinking daily activities in that language).\n\nFinancially I'm able to go to school without needing to work. The type of work I do allows me to sustain myself from a few months of work out of the year. I then use that time for volunteering, research projects, and clubs (school, not the clubbing club)... And some time wasters but it keeps me sane.\n\nWorking out, will start eventually. I'm not muscular, but nor am I fat. I'm much more lean. \n\nI never bothered with dating apps; the numbers are just depressing.\n\nIs there anything that jumps out at anyone?

Woohoo\nAnyways, I\u2019m having kind of a rough time right now. I\u2019m a junior in college at a large out of state university, and I have no real friends. I would probably consider my freshman year roommate to be my closest \u201cfriend\u201d here, but I still feel like we\u2019re not really that close. 95% of the time I am the one who initiates us hanging out. I feel like I can\u2019t really talk to her about anything in my personal life. A family member just died last week and I went back home for the funeral and missed three days of classes, and she didn\u2019t even realize that I was gone. \nAt the beginning of the year I texted five friends/ acquaintances to ask them if they wanted to hang out or study. Two of them left me on read. One of them and I made plans to get lunch but she forgot about them and I was left sitting in the restaurant alone for like 20 minutes. The fourth one and I actually made plans and hung out, but she made it pretty clear that my invite was out of the blue and that she really only thought of me as an acquaintance. The fifth one also made plans with me, but she cancelled the day of and promised to reschedule. She texted me back a few weeks later and asked me if I was busy, and I got super excited because I thought she wanted to hang out, but she ended up just asking me to babysit her kid instead because all of her other babysitters were out of town. \nI\u2019m currently part of a club, but we only meet every other week. It\u2019s also a club that\u2019s specific to my major, so we usually have presentations or something every meeting so it\u2019s not really the best opportunity to meet/ talk to other people. I also work a lot, and don\u2019t really have the time to join another club or activity. When I\u2019m not in class or working, I just spend all my time in my room. Sometimes I literally go a whole weekend without saying a word to anybody. \nAt this point in college, I feel like everybody already has their own friend groups and it would be weird and difficult if I tried to join a new one. \n\nAnyways, I don\u2019t really know what I\u2019m trying to accomplish by posting this. Its been kind of rough being this lonely all the time and I feel like I just needed to get this out. I\u2019m trying hard to be social and everything, but I feel like I\u2019m just that person that no one really wants to hang out with. I would appreciate any advice from someone who\u2019s been in a similar position :). \n\nTLDR: I\u2019m a college junior with no friends and despite my best efforts to try to be social and meet new people, it\u2019s not working out. I feel super lonely and sad and am looking for advice", "subreddit": "lonely"}

To give some context on why she stopped talking to me, we had been talking as friends for about 11 months and just before the summer she me asked me to be her boyfriend but I didn\u2019t give her a definitive answer and instead just kinda ignored it and said that I didn\u2019t know what to say her and because of me ignoring it and giving such a shitty excuse she took the blame and kept apologizing and saying that she was in the wrong for asking which made me feel horrible and I never got say sorry to her because after it happened we both just pretended like it never happened.

To me it feels pathetic that I\u2019m so desperate for friendship but I guess everyone has to have friends or just someone to talk to but anyway we would only really properly talk to each other through message and this is because we where both too awkward to be able to say anything to other and we both would just laugh about it and blame ourselves for being awkward. I had already told her how much our friendship means to me and she said the same and thanked me for talking to her as well.

People only care about those they can receive something from, like someone to make them laugh, someone to give them sexual/romantic pleasure, someone to give them emotional support, someone they can relate to and talk about their interests, etc. If you aren't most of these things to people, they won't need you. Everyone is selfish. There is no genuine friendship, it is a give and take relationship. A contract. If you can't meet the requirements, you're fucked. Life is better off anyway when you accept this and realize true altruism is an illusion, humans are selfish, and you are going to die alone.

Anyways, recently went out with my little sister and her friends on a bit of a night out, I'm the only guy and 4 girls in highschool (I'm 22).\n\n  \n\n\nI've known these girls since elementary school as they would come over for group projects and such and got to know them over the course of 4-8 years for the girls. I'm at a point where I became comfortable around them and talked with them without it being weird. In all that time and even now I never had a GF or even a date so these girls were the only ones I talked to. It was easy to talk to them and even could make them laugh and I honestly think they didn't mind having me around.\n\n  \n\n\nThing is I always talked with my sister present, I honestly never had a deep conversation as my sister would always be present or it would be all surface level talking. I wasn't trying to ever or ever felt any feelings for any of them.\n\n  \n\n\n  \n\n\nRecently when I went out with my sister and her friends (who are now seniors in highschool) . some situation happened where I was alone with one of the girls who is fairly new to the group and had a long conversation with her and she told me things she hasn't even told her friends and my sister.\n\n  \n\n\n  \n\n\nThe more I learned the more I felt something towards her. A somewhat grown women who seemed the most mature out of the bunch was laughing and engaging with me. It came so easily, even my sister came back and was like 'what are you guys doing' as she's never seen her friend talk like that.\n\n  \n\n\nThat night I slept with a smile and somewhat happy for the first time in what feels like forever, I like being around her and just talking. I don't think I have any sexual feelings toward her , just that being around her made me happy.\n\n  \n\n\n  \n\n\nI know she probably has zero feelings and just is friendly and I wouldn't want to ruin my relationship with my sister by asking the friend anything weird but it just felt nice.\n\n  \n\n\n  \n\n\nI feel sad now a couple days later, I realize now how one person can impact your mental health, all it took is one person that actually wanted to talk to me to make me happy. Ive never really felt happy until that day.\n\n  \n\n\n  \n\n\nI realize now that A LOT of people feel like this EVERYDAY, people who have close friends and significant others, in those 2 days I forgot I'm a 22 year old KHV and I didn't even visit this subreddit as it wasn't even on my mind(usually visit every night). I was actually more sad after because I realized my only meaningful interaction with a girl was with a girl 5 years younger than me, no girl has ever showed the amount of energy and interest in talking with me that is my age, ever. I think I'm going to take a break from this subreddit for awhile and Reddit in general and see if I can try and find someone who can make me feel happy again.\n\n  \n\n\n  \n\n\nUntil then, see ya.", "subreddit": "ForeverAlone"}

Im a 26yo male from another ruined society. Recently the silence has been defying and Im running out of will too preserver with it. Ive lived a pretty shitty life with many downs. Im blessed for the little I have tho recently Ive been questioning what I really bring too my life and those around me. 3 years ago I was doing well at dealing with a past I never healed from. I then fell in love with a girl I was friends for nearly 10 years. Sadly the fact I truly loved her started opening unhealed wounds that I carried because of love and broken trust from my youth. After a while I self admittedly became toxic and pretty controlling. I dont blame my past for the shitty guy I became tho If my life wasnt so out of control then I question would I have been as worried about having no control of things as an adult. Things finally got on  top of us when We found out she was pregnant. Honestly I had never been so scared in my life. I was so broken trying too convince myself that I could raise a child. I wanted too go ahead with it and promised myself Id never let my child live remotely close too the hell I iived through. Things were rough right up untill the first inital scan. Which was the first and only time ive felt genuine love in life when I seen my sons heartbeat. 20 mins later I was in a room with my then girlfriend and a midwife. What I didnt know was she had mentioned I smoked a bit of weed prior too that scan date. Which meant the midwife had too involve social services. That shook me because my whole life was shapped by My mother and her hard drug habit which meant I had a childhood of services constantly dictating my path. I couldnt bring that too his life and walked out the door angry, feeling so betrayed because she knew this fear. 3 years later my son Is nearly 2 and we havent met just like me and my dad. Ive been lower than I am now tho I cant accept this life and cant find the confidence too step out my room. I feel so alone with my battles. No advice, zero direction and no one too speak too about it. Everything inside me just wants too be a dad and feel that love Ive only for 5 minstes. I started off fighting for that but it complelely ruined me when I wasnt even told my son was born or healthy. It started me down a road of pain and sheer sadness. I ended up doing my own form of hard drugs, In the hope maybe Id feel just something... anything. All it did was push me futher into a hole. Last October I quit the drugs and have been off them for a year now but Im far more empty and even more silent. Recently Ive started accepting this is it for me. The pain, the silence and confusing is my life. I dont want too one day leave him with the same unanswered questions as me but with every day that passes my fear of death fades and I feel im closer too the end than him....

So this is the story of me finally having my first kiss at 21! I know I know, people say 21 is too Young to be FA but I think the existencial fear of dying alone and the massive inferiority complex trancends age. \n\nSo I matched with this girl on Tinder (before you call me a normie, I barely get matches and most of them ghost me especially after they find out about my height). At first, replies were slow like once every 12 hours. Then I eventually asked for any better way of contact and she gave me her FB. We messaged back and fourth until we findally decided to meet up. We were planning on going to a carnival my town throws every summer but before that we went to another town to get ice cream. Basic interactions whatever. She eventually asked me if I was ticklish then poked my side to see my reaction.\n\nI was so happy she did that cause that meant the touch barrier had been broken and I was happy she did it and not me cause if I tried and failed, it would've come off as massively creepy. We then went to my town but before we could go to the carnival, she said her battery was running low. So I suggested we stopped over at my place so she could charge it.\n\nAt my place, we charged it, I showed her around and I decided to show her some music on YouTube on the big telly in the living room. While we were waiting, she told me that she loves memes but didn't know any so I showed her some meme compilations. None of them even made her chuckle so I started showing her try not to laugh Videos. It worked. She eventually tried to tickle me since she found out I was VERY ticklish. We tickled each other back and fourth and eventually I ended up on top of her.\n\nI looked at her and saw my chance and went for it. I kissed her and we started a small make out session. It Felt surprisingly good for my first kiss especially after all the Horror stories I've heard but then again, I may have had way too much practice with my pillow. We kissed some more and then we went to the carnival after her phone was charged. After a while, we just snuck out of the carnival to a nearby park and kissed even more. \n\nWe eventually parted ways but in the chats afterwards, she said she couldn't have a relationship because of her mental state, my dumbass thought I could wait for her. We went on a second date, it was delightful, probably the best night of my life. We Held hands, she rested her head on my shoulder and even more kissing. After that we added each other on snapchat and chatted every day. Eventually she couldn't take it anymore and said we shouldn't see each other cause she didn't want to give me false hopes.\n\nIt was summer, I was desperate and I was hoping to finally lose my virginity so in one last desperate plea I asked if she could at least take my virginity. At first she agreed and I was so happy, excited and relieved but after meeting one more time, she said she couldn't do it and we broke off contact (apart from sending generic good morining snaps to Keep our streak going).\n\nA couple months later, I matched with someone else on bumble (I like it a lot better since the girls have to make the first move). She was awesome, interesting and she seemed into me (like actually putting effort into looking good for our date). We watched IT Chapter Two and she was terrified of Horror movies so she was hugging my arm the whole night. Eventually, during the final kissing Scene, I asked if she also wanted to kiss and we went for it. The date went so well and I thought we really clicked.\nThe next morning, after one Reply from her, she never replied to me again. She left me on read and totally ghosted me. \n\nMy take aways from this is that finally experiencing my first kiss and subsequent affection boosted my confidence. It made me feel worth a damn. I don't think I'm an unlovable loser who will die alone anymore (well at least not all the time). It gave me hope that it could happen again and it might go further. It gave me confidence to make the move. I didn't feel heartbroken because I never developed feelings for either of them. I think it's the defence mecahnism I developed after being rejected by my third onitis and almost committed suicide. I would never develop feelings for anyone again until I was 90% sure they were reciprocated.\n\nI'm not here to give BS advice, I'll prefice this. I JUST GOT REDICULOUSLY LUCKY. I matched with the right people and at least got a taste and lemme tell you, that small taste was already enough to boost my self confidence. I can only imagine what a full on relationship or losing my virginity would do. But yeah, I just wanted to share that.\n\nKinda like a study on how experiencing These sort of Things is actually important and how much a positive impact it will have on people despite what normies try to tell us.

But so often I realise (way too late of course) that they didn\u2019t see me the same way. Is it naive to think it\u2019s possible to find someone who loves you just as much as you love them? Anywho, after having your soul ripped apart like that so many times I guess you start building mechanisms to protect yourself from further soul wrenching action, (I have more horcruxes than Voldemort, and I didn\u2019t even have to kill anyone) so now I\u2019ve become this cold, cynical asshole, that hides any true feelings behind multiple layers of sarcasm, dry humour, and self deprecation, with a heavy dollop of cynicism to top it off. I can\u2019t even show love to my family for fear of them rejecting it. How do you break this cycle? I can\u2019t keep doing this forever, I don\u2019t WANT to do this forever, but I don\u2019t know where to start.", "subreddit": "lonely"}

I am new to reddit and joined specifically so I could find people like me, and to know that I\u2019m not alone. I would like to share with you all a resource which has helped me throughout the past few years. There is a listening helpline which is open 24/7 for anyone to call, completely free. This helpline was established many years ago and is run by a group of volunteers who care. What I love about them is that they do not offer you advice, and it\u2019s not for suicidal people, they don\u2019t pressure you to call back, they don\u2019t ask for your name or any identifying information or anything like that. They pickup the phone, say \u201chello\u201d and then listen to your problems, and it\u2019s a way for you to vent to a real person who doesn\u2019t know you, which I know can seem weird, but for me that\u2019s what has made it so beneficial. I always keep my emotions and thoughts bottled up, and I never share my emotions to friends or family because I just don\u2019t want them to worry about me. I like talking to a stranger who does not know me, I share all my sadnesses and emotions with them, and they listen. When I feel sad at night, and have nobody to talk to, I call them..The number for the helpline is (717) 652-4400. They don\u2019t ask for your name or anything, they just listen, which I think is great. Anyways, if you made it this far I want to thank you. I hope your life gets better and that you find happiness.", "subreddit": "lonely"}

Please feel free to look into my account and see how much I have wrote telling strangers my story of you. \n\nYou were much stronger than me. You ended this relationship and never looked back. Which is something I wouldn\u2019t have done. You know, if it wasn\u2019t for you to take action, we would still be in this loop and I will always find my way back to you somehow, as I always did. Well, I should be grateful that your tough heart didn\u2019t have mercy on my poor soul begging and pleading to you. As it\u2019s been 7 months and I still cling to you, I am doing much better than ever. I had the courage to do all the things that I never had the courage to do. I think the bliss of the breakup was inevitable. We both know that an homosexual interacial long distance relationship would have never worked, My heart had brought to my knees to you. I was tortured by your social media several times a day. I stalked and a stalked your friends. I googled the shit of all of you. I counted the likes and comments just to rest my brain. My brain.. that of which had been my number one enemy. Let me tell you about it, ever since you decided that I no longer part of your world, my brain started all the scenarios of you with someone else. I even imagined how would your child look like. I lived in the past day dreaming of you singing to me that perfect night telling me that you love me, and I have also travelled in time to the future where you have become a mother. The pain is indescribable. And to cure my rushing thoughts I tried every imaginable thing that I could pathetically think of. I have meditated to get you back. I prayed to God just to fix this issue. At the beginning, I wanted Karma and revenge so bad. I craved justice to be served and let the tables turn. Then, I just wanted relief of the pain at all cost. I just wanted peace with myself. I only had one wish, to go back to the person I was before I met you. I wanted to be the person who never cared. I have come to the conclusion that indeed, ignorance is a bliss. I would rather not know what you are doing and who are you with. I stopped hanging out around lovers, I stopped porn, I had to cure my depression with basics. I cut off all triggers. All social media. I deleted my apps. I was scared to look at you page. Because it always had something painful. I can literally say, I was more hurt after the breakup that while dating you. You have successfully hurt me so bad to the point of numbness. After 7 months of you completely acting like I have never existed, my brain and heart were at your feet beginning for closure. They were my enemies. They showed me all sorts of hell whenever I thought, maybe, just maybe you are missing me? No. The anxiety attacks, the emotional waves, my shattered pieces of self and confidence dropped bottom rock. I lost myself and soul gambling it to you. I never thought you were so cruel and savage to me? Did I deserve this from you? I never thought that cute face held so much harsh attitude towards someone who once loved. You know I fell for you ever since I met you. You knew my feelings. You used them against me. You were the stronger partner and I salute you for that. You had the upper hand and the control and power. I was madly in love to function. I was making decisions with my heart while you used your logic and you won. The after math was the disaster. I starter my research journey. I began to question my self worth, I joined support groups, I met people, discuss with spiritual guides, I started to compare our story to every experience I found. You were the main star. And the pain was getting greater. I tried rebound. I couldn\u2019t. Even when I ran away from reality, I started to see you with him in my nightmares. I woke up crying from my 6 hours sleep that I could get. My fears and true self were revealing themselves to me in my sleep when I am  defenseless. I felt I am being tortured by this love that the only thing I wanted so bad. Your love destroyed my being. While I only wanted to build something beautiful with you my princess. I failed this relationship. I started to join sports clubs to get over you. I met many people only. I sext them. I told them all about the fantasy kisses that I dreamed of performing with you. I felt a bit better, but still..I am still not done. I knew that you would eventually leave and you are the \u201cgrass is greener\u201d mentality kind of person and  I am sure you are the type of person who needs to show off to family and society. So my needy and clingy fears manifested my painful situation today. I couldnt believe you would ever be mine. Maybe it\u2019s my karma for having a friends with benefits while we were in distance relationship and you couldnt care less about me? When you had you studying and business and clubs ahead of me? I am paying the price of that mistake. But I swear to the Almighty God I never intended to cheat. It was just a waste of time and I loved you above all. My heart was with you. But you weren\u2019t here.  That person had given me the attention I wanted. I never liked him anyway. I cut off him too as he could have been the reason of this karma loop. I only cared about having you the most. I lost you.  And ever since, Everything else just became wortheless when I lost you. And finally, I just had the courage today to untag my self from the first and one picture of you and me when I visited you a year ago from your social media account. It was the last straw, that whenever I missed you, I would open my tagged photos and look at it. Well, no more. I used to know when you changed your privacy settings just by checking that picture as I am not following you and your profile is public, so I could tell. Anyhow, thats all for tonight.  :)", "subreddit": "lonely"}

I've had other instances too but with complete strangers. I was walking on my way to college and some guys shouted \"hey sexy\" and then started laughing to each other. They didn't do it because they were attracted to me, they did it because they wanted to be ironic because they actually thought I was ugly so they called me sexy to mock me, obviously.  I've had this happen to me a few times with different groups of guys.

I just want to retire somewhere and live a life of hedonism but I fear I don't have the strength or willpower. I want to ascend to the upper class just so I can retire early and comfortably as soon as humanly possible and buy a very small house somewhere and finally be left alone by this god awful society. I have given up on having a relationship and would just buy a high end doll and an array of sex toys for my sexual needs. Who knows what technological innovation they'll come up with in the coming years? VR could also be a great cope for masturbating, video games and getting some social interaction lost from lack of normal, healthy human relationships that I will never achieve. I'd have time to keep healthy through exercise and diet. The last part of my \"ideal\" life would be coping with non life destroying substances such as weed and psychedelics which I could tend to gardening with my free time. Psychedelics have been shown to help people with depression so maybe they could help keep me from roping in my isolation.\n\nI do so envy normie's ease of living in this world but it's frustrating to see them squandering it on bringing more people into this world, committing to the endlessly demanding and complicated task of raising children. Not just one but many. And buying shit they don't need therefore subjecting themselves to more wageslavery. And working until they're old just for more money. Most normies seem to have no problem with being slaves for 90% of their time all the time until they're old, instead of frantically searching for the first possible exit. It's like in order to function in this society you have to genuinely accept it wholesale. Compared to most normies my aspirations aren't large, but achieving things is difficult when you're poorly socially adjusted. I was brought up living a shell of a life. I can only imagine what I could have done if I grew up with proper guidance.\n\nSuccess in this world is dictated so much by social connections, interacting with this sick society and thriving within it. Constant depression and anxiety plague me. I struggle with lack of willpower and often think of just taking the easy way out. I dropped out twice when I first started college 2 and a half years ago. Many things have happened since then that have crushed my spirit and hopes. I wonder if I'll ever achieve the life I want, and if it's even a life worth living. I dread the path to to it.

I have always been an introvert. I think I realised that already in the kindergartern. I got involved in sports when I was 12. I really liked doing sports and in couple of years I got really addicted to it. I trained like 5 times a week or more and wanted to become a professional athlete.\n\nNow I'm 17 and I had a bit of a low point in sports so I took couple of months off to reconsider my goal of becoming a professional athlete. In this down time I realised that I haven't made any serious friendships or relationships. I had been always just studying for school or done training. I have changed schools two times to study subjects that I want and I realised that I don't talk to anybody from my old schools. No strong friendships were made. \n\nSo after I had thought about it I decided to hang out more with my current classmates to make a stronger bond. It's been fine with the boys. We been going to parties on weekends and I get along really well with couple of them who I also talk to outside the school on almost daily bases.\n\nNow here comes the problem. When I started talking to the girls then they got freaked out by me. I spoke to couple of girls from my class and after a while I got a message to my facebook from one of them saying that I should stop trying to talk to them because I'm freaking them out. I'm still really confused what I did wrong because in my mind I politely asked if they would be willing to go out with me. I even said that I want to go out as friends to chill and not on a serious date.\n\nThat's how I see it. In my mind I was really polite. I asked them out playfully because I was trying to be fun but it seems that they misunderstood me and now think that I'm a creep. I guess my attitude change was maybe bit to sudden for them. I have always been quite a dull guy and I tried to be more open. The girls say that I have changed when I stopped doing sports but not for the better.\n\nNow I'm sad, disappointed and angry at the same time. I'm sad because I feel that my reputation has been ruined in school. Although I was quiet and introverted my opinions and words were respected. Now people don't listen to my opinions that much. I'm disappointed that I was misunderstood that badly and I'm also disappointed in myself that I didn't know how to explain myself better. I'm also angry at myself for that reason. I'm also angry at the fact that it's the one time when I try to talk to people and they turn me down.\n\nI don't even know if there is any point in making an apology or trying to explain myself because I'm afraid that people will again misunderstand me and that I will only make it worse. I don't know if it even matters anymore because my reputation is ruined anyway.\n\nI guess I just comes down to the fact that I haven't done much communicating and socializing in the past.\n\nI wish could see this story from other angles but I guess I can't if people involved are not even willing to talk to me. I would like to at least understand what I did wrong.\n\nMaybe I'm just overdramatizing this for myself and in couple of years looking back I would just laugh at this but at the moment I feel depressed as fuck and I it's good that I can write this of my chest.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAlso sorry for any spelling mistakes as english is not my first language.", "subreddit": "lonely"}

We became friends in my first year in high school and we were for a while we were best of friends, We were so inseparable that people thought were gay lovers (He is Heterosexual and I consider myself kind of Bi curious but I have no attraction to him).\n\nWe both had other friends that we spoke to but when I observed his other friends, I thought they were generally toxic but I didn\u2019t care as I don\u2019t associate with people I view as toxic (You can see where this is going). Over the span of roughly 2 \nyears I can\u2019t help but notice he is becoming more toxic each time I interact with him. He doesn\u2019t listen when I speak to him as much, he sometimes ignores me altogether. When walking to and from school we sometimes have a third person walk with us and when this third person walks, my friend just straight ignores me each time. I had switched cliques in school to a group of old friends, one of which I had been close friends for 10 years and I did that because my previous clique became so toxic because my friend was an unwarranted bully. My old clique had roughly 10 people in it, that number is now 4. When I talk about my problems, he could not care so he would change the subject but when he talks about his problems you are obligated to listen.\n\nThing is though for me, I don\u2019t know why he does this to me. I try my best to be kind even while he doesn\u2019t reciprocate the kindness, I listen to him even though he doesn\u2019t listen to me and I\u2019m there for him even though he\u2019s not there for me. Maybe I bored him or irritated him somehow. Maybe I\u2019m just like him and I am a toxic friend too but convince myself that I\u2019m a good friend, or maybe I am not toxic and I might just be vastly different than him. Maybe it\u2019s the other way round for him and he views himself as the kind one and I am the toxic one\n\nAs much as I feel its better to not associate with toxic people, I find myself making an exception for him, but the question is: Why? Why do I find myself making this exception? I think it\u2019s simply because, I\u2019m terrified of becoming more lonely than I already am. I have few friends and I refuse to let that number of friends decrease further.  I lack the strength to tell him honestly and openly how I feel, I lack the happiness I used to have and can\u2019t get it back and I lack the willpower to ignore his apology (If he\u2019d even give me one).\n\nSorry for the long post, I had to tell someone this even if that someone is a guy I have never met.\n\nThanks for reading\n\nEdit: No longer bi-curious, definitely straight", "subreddit": "lonely"}

You could go through life being ostracized and outcasted for little to no reason (news flash this shit actually does happen and you don't exactly need to be an outright creep or have a \"bad personality\" for this shit to happen to you). You could go through all this shit alone with no one to be there with you throughout the whole ride and people will STILL try to justify it or find something bad you may have done that was deserving of this type of life.\n\nWhat's worse is like I said you could vent online to let out your frustrations in life (because you know....we're fucking human beings...?) and that will land you a oneway ticket to backlash and labeling. People will use your post as some sort of fucked up justification to your bad circumstances and claim \"well with a shitty personality like that what do you expect? Maybe if you had a more likeable personality...\" you know shit like that. \n\nThe irony is people that say bs like that are the people that complain and bitch the most on the regular and people don't have a problem with it.

But that's a topic for another time I could make a whole post about that bullshit.\n\nMy point is on top of going through these tough situations in your life you don't even have the luxury of expressing your feelings and hurt that's been troubling you for years because it may come off as sour and cynical. People don't wanna accept how cold the world actually is and because of that will stop at nothing to try to figure out how you may have \"deserved\" your misfortunes.

If we have to sit back listen to them bitch and moan about their love life why can't we do the same thing with our lack of love life?

It crashed and burned, and it's probably for the best, butI miss that tender touch, the texts filled with hearts and kisses.

Most people see I'm a brunette with blond highlights, but she was fascinated by my hair), my movements, my strengths and my weaknesses. I miss having someone who wanted to explore all of my interests. Now I have sport friends, nerd friends, hiking buddies, drinking buddies, etc but no one who wants to do everything I do just to be with me. \n\nIt's not just that I want a romantic relationship, I definitely do, but I've not been able to meet anyone so into me that they feel like they are living life with me. I don't have a best friend like in the movies to explore life with. I don't have a family who knows or has any interest in learning about me.

They want me to regularly visit them while I'm in university, which I leave for in August 2020.

(I am actually American, but they don't like paying taxes, so they gave up their American citizenship and took citizenship of a country which taxes less, and now live in Dubai, which I absolutely despise as a place. It's funny though, because they also fucking hate Islam, but we still live here. Bienvenido a Dubai!!) \n\nThe other day she was saying \"You'll be surprised at how long you'll be spending with us here while in university - like three months in school, two months here in Dubai, three months at school.\" etc etc. No, I don't want to spend 4 months a year with you, during which I will lose my mind. I do not want to spend more than two weeks at a time with my family, honestly.\n\nDuring the times I spend with them, they encourage me not to exercise and try and manipulate or control me if I take the initiative to, and feed me junk food because they can't be bothered to cook. They don't allow me to cook either because \"I'll ruin it\" (even for myself), and because \"men shouldn't cook.\" They discourage me from participating in extracurricular activities, like playing the guitar.\n\nI have a natural knack for history, and usually my highest grades are in history despite me never studying for those tests.

In fact, I was planning to study computer science because I'd had quite an interest in it ever since the eighth grade (I'm currently in my senior year of HS), but my parents didn't let me take computer science classes during my last two years of high school because they don't want me to study it in university. At first, I agreed, because I know CS - unlike physics - can easily be picked up in university. My parents instead want me to study engineering. I have slight enjoyment in physics, but not much in engineering.

Since then I\u2019ve had my ups and downs with thoughts of ending my own life. I\u2019m in a relativly good spot now while only thinking about it when I get depressed and it doesnt last more than a few minutes. My dads side of the family has mental health problems such as bipolar and depression, and I feel I may never truly escape my depression. Two years I was stuck in a major depression which I\u2019ve recently come out of, but just like the thoughts, I can feel it lingering at the bqck of my mind. I\u2019m only 20 and I\u2019m scared one day I\u2019ll just get fed up with not feeling like the old me when I never even knew what it was like to be depressed, and just end it. I know right now I\u2019m too scared to take my life and I can\u2019t leave my brother behind, but that only makes me more upset. I\u2019ve tried one anti depressent for a month, but it changed me for the worse so I\u2019m not on anything. I don\u2019t wanna take meds if theyre gonna make me feel like a completely different person, but I see very few options on how to deal with it. Been sober for a few months too which has helped, but I don\u2019t even know if I\u2019ll make it to 23. I can\u2019t imagine getting old, finding true love and having a family. Its just problem after problem, and after writing all this out I finally realize just how fragile I am. I\u2019m one traumatic event from being locked up in an asylum or worse, killing myself.

The only friends I have here I've either lost touch with, live far away, or are married and dealing with their own stuff. I work from home as a transcriber, so it's difficult to make friends considering the fact that I don't have any in-person co-workers to talk to.\n\nAs far as relationships go, I haven't been in one in over a year. Something bad happened to me in my last relationship that has made me weary of being able to trust someone else enough to be in a relationship at the moment. Plus any opportunities I've had to start one, the guy was either the wrong guy or I was too painfully shy to ask for their number. I don't want to try online dating. I've been down that road and I'm sick of it.\n\nHaving to move back in with my parents has kind of killed my self-esteem. I feel like I can't do much of anything outside of work, although I long to get out of here all the time. I want to start my education up again, and with the career field I want to go into, I'd have to live with my parents even longer to be able to fully focus on my studies. I suffered a concussion at my previous job a few years ago and never fully recovered from it, making learning new things or even things I've learned in high school difficult to learn/relearn again.\n\nI don't really know where to go from here other than just to register with school again. It's the only way I'll ever get out of here. I feel pretty dead inside though. At my old apartment, I used to be able to walk around and do whatever I wanted. Now it's like it's 10 years later where my mother is still outside of my door talking to me again, which makes me feel like I haven't made any progress in moving forward with my life. It feels like I'm back where I started. I don't feel as if I'm able to provide for myself, live freely, and be my own person because my parents are around. I don't know if that makes sense, but it's really annoying and I can feel myself regressing. I don't feel like I'm growing as a person.\n\nI would try moving in with a roommate, but I've already done that twice and I just don't like living with other people. I won't do that again unless I'm married or something.\n\nI feel like I'm the only one in this situation, although I know there are many others who are probably also in the same or at least similar situation as I am.", "subreddit": "lonely"}

(which is generally true, except when you do need them.)\n\nHow do you deal when you\u2019re logical and know you\u2019ll make it thru, which is what you tell all your friends cuz it\u2019s the logical truth and so they believe you... but for one moment you want to be that person who is crazy dramatic like the world is ending.  Like for one moment actually have your logical realistic thoughts match your emotions. \n\nHow does one get thru the lonely feeling? What do you do? \n\nIdeally long term and learning solutions, I don\u2019t mind pressing thru the storm to learn. I don\u2019t mind a challenge and dealing with cleaning my own crap to get it out of the way for a better future.

Even with the slight financial strain I'm under, things have been going alright. But I just got hit hard last night by an emotional train. I just feel so damn alone. Even though I have my parents close by and I'm able to see them everyday if I want to, I've got friends I can see when I'm off work, I have places to go and explore, I just feel alone. I've been single for a few years, which I know is adding to it, not to mention a cause of me moving out was depression and a suicide attempt. I was fine for the better part of a year, but it just caught up with me all of a sudden. I can't sleep, I've caught myself thinking about suicide again, and I just want to curl up and cry.

I also had a strong crush on the only girl who was ever nice to me during this period. Going into middle school, I had pretty shitty social skills so I'd hang out with most of the other outcasts. In year 9, I noticed one of the year 7's who had just transferred didn't have any friends. She also told me she had social anxiety. I was at this point friends with quite a few of the year 7 boys, because I played sport with them. I tried to integrate her into their group and check up to see if she was doing ok. I was really happy because she was the first female friend I'd ever made.   \n\n\nHer and another one of the girls told me I was creepy, and they both knew I was only doing it to sleep with her, but I never would because I was ugly. They also told a lot of the year 7 boys I'd been saying creepy things to her, which made me lose a lot of friends. This gave me heavy social anxiety when I'm around girls of that age.   \n\n\nI moved to a different high school to put that behind me. In my second year, I asked out the first girl I had a crush on, saying I always liked her and I'd like to get to know her on Valentines day. All of her friends though it was cute, but she just looked at me with absolute disgust for a few seconds and walked away.  \n\n\nI asked out a girl who I regularly studied with to prom.  She blushed and said she'd think about it, but later said she told me she decided not to go. She then went with another guy.   \n\n\nI got my first girlfriend in my second year of university. We lost our virginity together. She used to tell me that her ex-boyfriend was abusive, but she ended up cheating on me with him when I went to see my dying grandfather. I forgave her for that, but I lost all of our mutual friends after we broke up.  \n\n\nMy second girlfriend dumped me after three months because she wanted to date someone taller. Aside from the height, we got along really well, but it was a dealbreaker.   \n\n\nAfter that I've had multiple hookups on sites like Tinder, but it's all fairly hollow. I feel like my ability to trust women in relationships is shot. Some of the girls on tinder even tell me they have boyfriends after we have sex. All I wanted when I was younger was to find a girl and make a happy family, but every single romantic experience I've had indicates that this is very unlikely to happen.   \n\n\nSorry for the wall of text, but I just wanted to vent. I'd also like to hear if you've had similar experiences.", "subreddit": "ForeverAlone"}

Not because therapists have some special kind of knowledge or hypnotic magic tricks up their sleeve.   \n\n\nIt's basically a substitute for social interaction. Your therapist in that sense becomes a Rent a BFF.. If you're lucky enough to be able to afford a decent therapist that is.  \n\n\n..which makes me wonder if rich people do indeed get better therapy than the average Joe, although a lot of the 'high end luxury expensive therapists/psychologists' I have seen on TV just seem to have an agenda and an inflated ego. They come across more as personalities and entertainers, or someone trying to sell a book, than anything else. (\\*cough, cough..\\* *Send her to the ranch, you archetypal lobster!*)  \n\n\nTo tell you the truth, I only go to counseling these days to receive disability payments (autism, mood disorders, sleep disorders, etc.). Last time I went there my counselor literally asked me:  \n\n\n\"So what are you hoping to get out of our counseling sessions?\"  \n\n\nI just said to her: \"I need a Miracle\".   \n\n\n..followed by 20 minutes of sitting in silence while awkwardly watching the poor old lady's hands shaking.  \n\n\nI think from that day on I had this unsettling realization that life does not guarantee happy endings, and that society is basically just a technologically advanced concrete jungle.. a survival of the fittest type of game that doesn't really care if you lose.  \n\n\nHaving said that I actually feel much happier now that I've come to this realization. It's kinda liberating to know that you're fully in control of your life.. that everybody around you is just as fucking crazy as you are, including your therapist.. and that being socially isolated might actually become the norm one day, given the trends we're seeing with social media, smartphones and technology in general.", "subreddit": "ForeverAlone"}

They were panicked that they were going to get kicked out.  I reassured them there's almost no chance.  Watched them text what was most likely their boyfriend.  I realized I could never find that kind of emotional support.  It's a foreign idea.  I just work through it internally.

Life has gotten pretty mundane. I\u2019m not the kind of person that drinks or whatever, so I\u2019ve already lost some sort of potential link to potential friendships. I think a lot and lately I have been thinking about my current status of relationships in my life. I\u2019ve realized that I don\u2019t really have anyone I feel close to, or really appreciates me or anyone who\u2019s company I can appreciate, like a real friend type of thing. And it\u2019s not like I can\u2019t have fun, but I\u2019m usually never in the position to. Usually I\u2019m relatively reserved, but the real me is someone who I think people can have fun with. Like, not a boring person. And it\u2019s not like I don\u2019t take care of myself either, I\u2019m very in shape and make sure my appearance is clean. But I do have a hard time making that first step when it comes to friendships. I\u2019ve realized that a lot of insecurities that I\u2019ve had when I was young still affect me. For some reason, i can\u2019t picture myself approaching someone to get to know them, and them having a positive response or being interested enough to build something. I found some type of \u201cuniversal\u201d rule that, in order to build relationships, you must go out of your way to find them and to develop them as much as you can. But one thing that really confuses me is that even though I\u2019m trying to, why is no one trying to get to know me or build a relationship with me. I\u2019m a very logical person and whenever I can\u2019t understand the logic of things like this it effects my ability to actually do it. That\u2019s kinda besides the point but, if I were to approach someone and try to talk to them would that come off as weird or am I just overthinking it. And it\u2019s as if, due to my personality, if someone were to, express something trying to say I\u2019m not interested or whatever, I would easily pick up on it because that\u2019s what i expected. Then I would overthink the whole situation and examine what I did wrongs to the extreme. Then this itself would hinder my ability to try again.

It's to the point where it's a very visceral physical feeling in my chest area and it wells up inside me and actually makes my heart ache and tears fill my eyes whenever I feel it. Part of this is that i really feel like i want a girlfriend, someone to love, have sex with, to hold and to cuddle. I'm so touch deprived it's not even a joke, and sure it's kind pathetic but this is my life - this is where i'm at. I've considered going to a hooker to just cuddle, no joke, or maybe even to have sex as well, but i haven't gone that far down the rabbit hole thank fuck. Over the years i've actively tried to get a girlfriend, I've done almost everything - started lifting, hitting the gym, eating better, tried to have a positive outlook, looked up rsd and pickup videos and approached HUNDREDS of women and tried to be my best self in these interactions. it has only led me to more loneliness and basically no results. the most i've had is minor very short lived hook-ups, funnily enough never from approaching women on the street but through other means. the last extremely short lived hook up being over a year ago which is why i'm really feeling that lonely pang and that i want to cuddle with a girl or at least be with a woman again.\n\ni feel worthless, dejected, unwanted, basically subhuman. when i think about the idea that maybe no one loves me and that perhaps i am unlovable and truly just unattractive it really hurts me and makes me well up with tears. its fucked. for the longest ive been saying, ok i need to sort my shit out, no more watching porn (i'm addicted). time to do nofap, stop focusing on women and just work on myself for a bit, but inevitably i find myself drawn to the first fucking cute girl that shows me the slightest bit of attention and i end up trying to talk to them, chase them and start a relationship or jsut to maybe get the basic human need of some fucking affection met, and it ALWAYS ends in disappointment and frustration and i feel even worse, even more pathetic, even more like a creep, even more feeling maybe i'm unlovable and just some beta incel or something. it frustrates me that that word gets thrown around to men who are opening up about their genuine needs and emotions, but thats another post for another day. im not really sure what to do. ive tried self improvement and have basicalyl recently just embraced letting the chips fall wehre they may. i'll probably start therapy soon and try to work on this deep sense of loneliness.\n\noh and a note on friends, i don't know if its just me but I have friends, and i do hang out with them from time to time, maybe not as much as before because ive been working so much, but i do, and i go to events and stuff and meet new people and be social and happy and shit, even talk to my friends on the phone and in person about my depression and how i've been feeling. it basically does not even dent the loneliness i feel. i don't think this is something that can be cured by just having a nice social life, but maybe by having a girlfriend, that i can be intimate with. even then, that might not work. but it would sure as shit help a lot.\n\ni'm tired. i fear that this loneliness might be the death of me pretty soon.", "subreddit": "lonely"}

But note this, I haven\u2019t done anything wrong that would\u2019ve cause this. And then it got to a point where my best friends left me. They never said good bye or anything. So I started to go to school alone and be there alone and leave alone, cause no one would talk to me, more like I had to talk to them, but  I don\u2019t anymore because I feel like I\u2019m bothering them. And then once in while and old friend would talk to me and say hey how\u2019s it been, how come you haven\u2019t talked to us or hanged with any more. And I would say because you guys don\u2019t invite or talk to me. But I thought I wasn\u2019t that lonely because I had my family right, nope, after sophomore year when I became a loner at school, my family started to talk to me less and less to a point where I only see them In the morning and night, and we say the dryest things to each other like good night or morning. And I haven\u2019t been out with my family since then. And I try to tell them we should but they say no or there isn\u2019t enough time.

Sure I may be boring, there nothing interesting about me. But I\u2019m willing to give the world to any girl tbh.

But one stood out amongst the rest. This blonde blue eyes goddess with the most infectious smile drove my middle school self insane. I became infatuated with her. I first started out just stating at her not knowing what to do as these feelings were new to me. But one day I had enough of my prepubescent balls to get up and talk to her. And before I knew it despite my tremendous anxiety I found myself talking to her and finding out we had a lot in common. From there we became friends. My first if only 4 females friends in my life. We shared many laughs and good times with each other. I distinctly remember talking to her on the bus when she playfully started drawing on my face with her pencil. I smiled saying \"does my face look like a piece of paper to you?!\" She in turn smiled with her pearly whites teeth and piercing blue eyes reflecting off the light of the day.Ice never felt such profound love for anyone then I did in that moment. it was as wholesome as it gets. It felt like as if me and her where on a crash course forwards each other. It seemed we were perfect for each other. She filled me with such joy and euphoria of which I still have not felt again to this day with any woman. Alas you know this has to end badly.this is an r/Lonely post after all. So the 7th grade Halloween dance comes along. It's 2013 and Batman Arkham origins just dropped and I was off to my first and even though I didn't know it at the time last school dance of my life.I went to the dance dressed as James bond. Complete with a bowtie and Rose in my right vest pocket with my hair all nice and gelled up of course. I looked great.I arrived and saw her in the crowd almost immediately. I was blown away by her beauty. She was a cat. Yes that's rather boring. But the prepubescent kid I was got blown away by something different this time. Her costume was a onesie that cut of at her torso and she had pantyhose on with high heels. I saw in her for the first time not just her beauty but her sexuality. I found myself even more enthralled with her. Not only was head over heels in love with her. Now I lusted for her.i don't know what happened but seeing her dressed like that in that moment surrounded by the whole grade I just couldn't make a move. I found myself at a load for words and completely socially stunted. Why all of a sudden I can't talk to this girl. When we've been good friends for over a year now. So I just sat in the bleachers completely mortified at the thought asking her to dance like my original intent was. But eventually a slow song came on and I painfully forced myself o approach her. Every step I took towards her filled me with an ever increasing sense of dread and overwhelming anxiety like I've never felt before. Then there I was standing before this goddess of mine. She looked at me gave me that trademark heart melting smile and greeted me. I exchanged greetings forcefully and proceeded to ask her to dance with me. (It should be noted that this was my first time ever asking a girl to do anything romantic with me)I started off saying.(l\"hey Annabel you mind if I have this.....\" Nothing. I said nothing. My mind and mouth just ceased to produce words and I froze in perpetual fear right in front of her and her friends. She inquired saying \"mind if you have what?\" Multiple times but all I could out was stuttering garbage.aftet a minute of this she simply walked away. I sat back down at the back of gym and felt the weight of the whole world crash on my shoulders. I felt sad,ashamed but for the first in my life I felt pathetic.just one week later Annabel would get her first boyfriend and I would never have her as my own. This devastated me as I would cry myself to sleep at night constantly at the thoughts of my profound failure. I would retract from speaking to girls almost entirely from fear of getting hurt again and this still persists to this day.Now I'm  18 years old and I'm in the army. Yet this event which happened so long ago was the first domino in my descent into a Lonely,bitter and sexually frustrated adolescence. And I don't see that changing anytime soon. Sometimes when im alone with my thoughts in bed at night. I still miss her. If only she knew how much she meant to me.", "subreddit": "lonely"}

I feel it kinda started to turn into a rant so I apologize now for that, I just decided to type exactly what came to my head at the time.\n\nI'm sure its a common thing on here. But fuck man, I swear every time something starts to go good in my life where I'm like this can be the turnaround that I wanted, some random bullshit happens and strips it all the way and I'm right back in the same hole. I just feel like fate decided that it always just wants to screw me over at my highest points. And like it sucks, because I don't want to be a burden to my friends to talk about it when I feel like this, or they just don't get it. Recently for me it was over a girl and my friend only said \"is this gonna be that bullshit moping thing you always do\". So I guess they are tired of dealing with it even though I never usually bring things up around them anyway. I'm kind of just ranting since I really got no one that I want to go drop these all my issues on so I apologize if anyone is just like wtf is this. I don't know if I just take things super personal or maybe some things are coincidental, and I have my insecurities and boundaries so maybe its just the fact that I don't normally \"let people in\" and then these things happen and it just literally drives a stake through me where I just don't want to talk or eat or do anything and all I can do is just sit with my thoughts, which ends up with me looking over the scenario that put me in these situations in the first place. And the thoughts start rolling through, \"not good enough\" \"not meant to be happy\" I don't know.\n\nI don't know if it becomes like an obsessive thing or not but its just like using the same example of this girl, its just like things were going pretty perfect in my opinion (perfect connection, amazing personalities, just everything i can ask for) and then after a really nice weekend and texting all day to each other couples shit. I just get a message after a small few hour break of not messaging just getting a random text of My family is having issues and I need to be there for them, and need to focus that. And honestly that shit broke me, no idea why because we weren't talking/dating super long but it legit hurts more than my 7 year relationship. I don't know if its just from after years after of feeling insecure and not putting myself out there usually because i feel I'm not good enough for the other person. I finally take the step out and open my doors back and as I said it was good, but then literally doors slammed in my face. And the recent why I brought up the obsessive thing is I'm like really down about it, but the only way to get a little up is to look back at the conversations and shit because it legit made me happy but then I'm in the circle of back into now this shit is gone too.\n\nAnd then now my only coping mechanisms to attempt at getting out of my depressive funks (for most of them not just this one) is literally just romanticizing some stupid scenarios that are more than likely 100% not going to happen just to literally build up a sense of false hope to attempt to get through it until hopefully all the feelings just dissapear.\n\nBut then I feel like at the point I just become an emotionless person, with literally just a cold heart. And it just happens that way, like I feel like its getting to a point where I'm just losing all my sense of emotion to the point where I just don't do anything or have a feeling of things until they randomly just creep up on me. Like my dad died 2 years ago, I got a phone call out of the blue saying they found him and he had taken some drug that was a bad batch and died. All that happened was I just couldn't speak, no feelings I think when it did finally hit I cried 1 tear.\n\nLike its just I don't know what happening to the point where I feel like I am just becoming a soulless void, and as stated I've been just getting by on just creating these false reality scenarios in order to go about life. And shit just starts piling up, I've thought about ending it multiple times, like it probably comes up a few times a week. I will just feel like I am just not happy with where my life is at, and I'll legit be driving and just be like \"I could just floor it into this wall\" or things like that, my thing is that I don't think Id ever act on these things, I think my lowest was literally looking down a gun barrel but never loaded it with anything. And i don't want to end it honestly, just because I feel it would make me feel like more of a burden to my closer family and friends. I usually just spend my days trying to make others happy even at the expense of my own happiness and sanity. Maybe that's my problem I really don't know. I obviously want to be happy but I just cant seem to get it to happen, whether its a lot of fuckin coincidence or fate, I cant figure it out. Its possible that I just haven't felt happy in so long that I'm not used to it and just let that darkness back in.\n\nIts not fun when the only things going through my head are the \"not good enough's\", \"never going to happen\" \"not going to work\" \"wont be successful's\" \"I'm just a PoS\" and the over all just over thinking of every little thing and scenario. It just essentially just builds up to a point where I will just have an emotional breakdown after a few years of dealing with these things. Usually end up having a big one every 2 years or so.\n\nAt this point i feel like I'm just rambling, and dont really know how to end this or what the purpose of it was. I just needed some how to vent and felt this was an OK place to do it. So for those who read all this thanks I guess, I'm just going to stop now.", "subreddit": "ForeverAlone"}

I made two huge improvements in my life. My social life is no where to be found but hey, I\u2019m making money! Honestly being generally busy distracts me from not having much of a social life or a girlfriend or any of that stuff. People say college is supposed to be the best time of your life, and I know that\u2019s not what\u2019s gonna happen in my life. This isn\u2019t my peak. \n\nHigh school was a failure for me when it comes to women as well. I was too anxious and too quiet and couldn\u2019t make a move on the one girl who gave me tons of opportunities back in the day. I regret missing out on that, but I may not be the man I am today if I didn\u2019t fail back then. Back then in my senior year when I was 17, was the first time I felt truly alone. I remember feeling the hatred inside of me, the rage flowing through my body. I would think of my past and get bitter and try to forget it. Sometimes it still happens to me today... now I just use my anger in the gym. \n\nI always find it funny that when you ask for advice on how to get a girlfriend on Reddit or anywhere, they act like you have to go on some monk journey of self improvement in order to get the girl of your dreams. It\u2019s so wrong, she\u2019s not the reward you\u2019re going to get at the end of the tunnel. That\u2019s what these people make it sound like. Also, I\u2019ve seen much uglier men my age get girlfriends, and they don\u2019t go on monk journeys. \n\nI think self improvement is something everyone should be working on all the time, don\u2019t just do it to get a girlfriend. Do you think I go to the gym because I hope the girl of my dreams will fall for me? Fuck no, I go because I want to be strong like the characters I watch in anime shows LOL. Obviously I won\u2019t be able to teleport and shit or awaken a rinnegan, I just wanna be strong. \n\nUltimately, I think at least my problem is I seem to be incapable of moving past asking out a girl. I\u2019ve never been on a date, but I don\u2019t understand how to be romantic or show interest without turning it platonic. I know what it is, but pulling it off is foreign to me.

I just need to know if this is how life is.\n\nGrowing up, I was a fairly bad looking kid,pretty asymmetrical face, was a little chubby and had low self-esteem which caused my social ability to suffer. As a result my quality of life was overall bad because when you're put in this situation you just don't have positive experiences throughout life and they shape who you become.\n\nThere was a period in my life between the ages of 18-19, straight after high school and in my first year of University where I changed dramatically, I'm not sure how it happened but it was only for this period of time. I was very healthy in every aspect for this short period of time (physically, mentally and spiritually); girls were giving me attention and people were generally treating me better despite me saying and doing the same things I had done prior to this change. Now I know this is not anecdotal because I've really thought about what the differences were in these situations, and it all came down to looks.\n\nAll I can say for certain, is I had my braces (teeth) removed during this period and my asymmetrical face became a healthy square jaw, I was going to the gym regularly and had low body fat and was well rounded in all aspects.\n\nThis slowly changed and I'm not sure why... My sleep quality deteriorated from age 20-21 (3-4 hrs of sleep a night, heart palpations etc) and I couldn't go gym or take care of myself as much because I was very frail during this time. During this time, you can imagine how difficult it was to not get the support I needed from those around me, and I believe it is because I was not the healthy ideal person you would want to be around as I was during this brief period of time.\n\nCurrently I'm 22 years old and living life very safe, not drinking, eating clean and keeping exercise extremely moderate (if at all) because I'm afraid of going through the nightmare I went through in the past; despite all this I don't feel as good as I did at 18-19 when I was drinking and sleeping at 2am. I'm unemployed and stay at home all day and make some money selling things online, living with my parents and getting my 2 final semesters out of the way, but I don't even know if I'm healthy enough to enter the workforce and feel like I'll be handicapped in the world by my looks. I want to note I don't think I'm THAT ugly, maybe a 6/10, but it's like I'm so broken I can't smile genuinely, because I rarely receive positive feedback when I do. It is the culmination of my life experiences combined with not being particularly pretty that makes my life difficult.\n\nI don't get treated as well as I did during that year, the best year of my life. And even that year was filled with self-doubt and asking my friends if I was ugly with my newfound courage to ask them that, all it did was push everyone away as I fell back into my depressive tendencies very quickly.\n\nI don't know. I live life rationalizing it as my own shortcomings and being negative, but even the times I am positive I receive disgust in response, in a way that isn't subtle, I can feel it.

MY FUCKING BAD. She didn't even tell me either why or what happened really at the time. She just started ignoring my messages and calls and only after I tried and tried to get an answer she finally told me why.

Because I thought I loved him. And then when we hit a rough patch he just left me. Blocked me on social media and that was it. \n\nHow can someone do that? I don't get it. I would **never** leave someone's life I knew was struggling.

{"post_id": "dmfbsj", "created_utc": 1571918116, "title": "Descriptions.", "author": "BeckfordDacre", "self_text": "One thing I've observed about this kind of lifestyle is how it changes your reactions to people's perceptions of you and the terms they use to describe those perceptions. Things that you once imagined were praiseworthy now become sources of shame that torment you daily.\n\nTo give an example, people have often referred to me as a studious person. I was not always so (excessive drinking and starving myself in my late teens/early twenties contributed to an apathetic decline), but I worked hard to address these flaws. Compared to my peers, I avoided parties and clubs and devoted myself to academic study, certain it would pay off in the future. For a while this attitude served me well, but now my academic career has come to an end, I am woefully behind professionally and socially. Therefore 'studious', a term I once admired about myself due to its connotations of dedication and redemption, is now poison to me; it conjures up images of me wasting my youth on long and lonely nights studying something pointless and having a black hole where a deep passion for research used to reside, one I am not likely to refill.\n\nSimilarly, I feel this way about the terms 'reliable' and 'gentle', other terms used to label me especially with regard to my attempts at relationships. I was always complimented by my supervisors for my punctuality and willingness to do extra work without recompense, work that ultimately proved to be of little benefit to me. 'Reliable' now implies to me a doormat who has no human connections and no life outside of fulfilling meaningless quotas; additionally being described as 'calm and reliable' is laughable considering the mental disintegration I have endured over the past two years, which has led to the darkest thoughts I've had in a long time. The same occurs with the adjective 'gentle'. The one woman I have connected with called me this favourably in contrast with other men, and yet she took advantage of this 'gentleness' to manipulate me and concoct lies just to get rid of me and avoid difficult conversations, knowing I would 'do the right thing' and meekly fade away. This term now hurts the most to me. Indeed, I wanted to be that gentle person to those around me, doing unto others as I wished to have done to me, and providing a sanctuary for a partner away from the world's cruelty. But 'doing the right thing' causes one such pain when all it has led to is one being abused or exploited. A so-called gentle person is a person who is so pathetic they cannot stand up for their needs and who will believe any fiction that comes out of a person's mouth, and who is proven to be unable to handle it when those illusions are shattered.\n\nReflecting on what I've written, I'm not sure I've quite enunciated what I wanted to say. But these things which family and society at large told me were important and admirable things have caused me little but disappointment and pain, and being labelled as this person makes me feel very bitter - indeed I dread being called 'sweet' or 'reliable' now, because I know this person has worked me out for the wreck that I am. All of these above traits a potential partner could get from someone else without all of my baggage. But I suppose in one way I should be grateful to have these empty terms reverberating shrilly in my ears; because if I couldn't hear them, all I'd have is silence.", "subreddit": "ForeverAlone"}

There is a girl I'm interested in and we were suppose to have a \"date\" yesterday. We didn't have a time pinned down so I figured she would text at some point. She never did. I thought about asking her what the plan was but my mind went into overdrive telling me how much of a piece of shit I am and how she never wanted to do anything anyways. (Even though she asked and it was her idea). I was kinda happy at first but now I wish I had. I just don't know what to do. No one in my family has ever been in a happy loving relationship. My parents, grandparents, siblings all seem to just be in relationships because they don't want to be alone. Most of my aunts and uncles have been divorced and remarried at least three times. Everything just seems to be one sided and the other person doesn't reciprocate it. I've never had the feeling of \"love\" i guess. I've never had the butterflies in my stomach, looking for them when I know they are around, and counting down the time till I can see them again. I want to have someone in my life. I want someone to talk to, to share dreams with, to be intimate  with, someone to share my life with. I really like this girl. She is nice, pretty, she gets my dumb sense of humor, kinda awkward like me and she likes me. I think I like her too but I don't want to start something and waste her time. I just know this isn't going to work out or it will happen and she will end up wasting her life with someone she shouldn't be with and her real \"soulmate\" that would give her her best life will pass her by. Then we will end up in our 50's and she will resent that she wasted so much time with me or maybe there will be a kid and she decide it's best to stay together for the kid and resent that whole situation for happening.

Maybe if we can all realize that it's really pretty normal to feel lonely (or weird), we can stop the cycle of these defeating thoughts and start to get better. There's some research that says the two largest groups which are vulnerable to feeling isolated are adolescents and elderly folks, but if you live in these areas, please reach out no matter where you are in life, if you are willing to share your story. I've felt so dark and alone at times in life, and climbing out can seem impossible, but I hope we can use this film to give people a hand to at least start the process.

I've got no friends to talk about this, so, here i am... \n\nI'm 21 and, as the title says - a gay dude. It even feels weird classifying myself as that, because being one is a stigma in my country (Lithuania, hi). For those reasons, I've had to distance myself from everyone - family, some friends, even myself. It's easier to pretend i'm straight and I've gotten so good at it - I became pretty detached from that part of me, i blur out my sexuality only when it's important, people are outing me or i just feel comfortable talking about it. Anyway. Last year something changed. It was subtle at first, a glance, a look, an awareness of a first-year. He did not stand out in any way, not to anyone else, but there i was, thinking of him sometimes. I'm active in my university community, so  people know me and i know them, so through people, in about 3-4 months I started gathering info about that first-year (freshman?) and from observing him theorized he's probably gay too. But whatever - we didn't talk, there was no point to try even. In my mind, I shouldn't even try dating, as long as i'm depressed (diagnosed, not by myself lol) because that's just needless baggage for another person to take into too - so i try to stray away from \\*feelings\\*  \nSummer came, i went abroad to earn some cash, so not to be such a burden for my parents, as i lived in a bigger city and i left my family in a pretty small one.  I thought getting out would be a cool idea - changing the scenery, earning cash, networking, all the good stuff. Also, i tried to smother all my feelings for him, because he definitely was not the first I had to do that.   \nSo i come back. I see him sometimes - feel nothing. Good.  But as the month progressed, i bumped into him more and more, we played pokemon go a few times around the city. Shared some memes. All that happened in a span of two weeks. And i broke, broke, broke like i never broke before. Out of nowhere he is on my mind,  left and right, i can't stop thinking about him.... as my 3rd year goes, he's doing his 2nd year and i'm helping him as much as i can. We both text each other on the daily now. Memes, jokes, simple stuff. And we dance around the idea of us , as in US TOGETHER, not touching it directly, but letting know that none of us know how to behave in a relationship, what to expect and, quote : \"not wanting to burden the other person by our needs\"  \nYeah, cool, whatever, i'm not searching for anyone, i'm not worth of being with but i have never cried myself to sleep before, that's how lonely i feel, how lonely i know he is and how this whole thing is going nowhere. We meet one or two times in a week, since we are in a dance group for a special dance ball. And i feel like trash if I don't create an interesting or funny conversation for him to giggle or smile to. Always a funny joke, something  SOMETHING to just see that damned smile, just to reassure myself that he even sees me, that he knows i care....  \n\n\nLast sentences were written with tears in the eyes, I don't even know what i wanted to say. I guess something i could never tell him. He deserves someone who can understand him and himself, not a depressed dude. I hope he'll have a fulfilling life, smiles and reliable friends. I just wish i could help him, make him smile more.... This is my first post so i guess sorry for making it long...\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTL;DR  \nI'm craving for attention i can't get ant thus, making myself feel miserable, but with a twist - i'm gay.", "subreddit": "lonely"}

Will i be able to make something of myself and stop wasting this gift that's called life which was bestowed upon me ? \n\nFor anyone that read through all that...Thank you \u2764\ufe0f", "subreddit": "lonely"}

I need to express my feeling in a way people to people who don't know me, therefore they hopefully wont judge me.\n\nSo for a bit of context I'm 21 man and I have been having an ongoing battle with depression and anxiety, mixed with my aspergers for over 10 years now due to difficult childhood and bad upbringing. Living with two mentally unwell parents did not help as they were constantly in their own battle. From this regard I was already alone. As they would go in and out of hospital, I went in and out of care and never had a consistent life. So for a long time now I have been alone, until my sister was eventually born.\n\nMy whole life I have been lonely and over the past few years my life has picked up a little bit. I am quite close with my younger sister and my mum has gotten better. I  now even had a group of friends finally after so many years struggling to fit in. I even had hookups and short encounters with women but neve had a proper girlfriend per say. All my friends back at home have girlfriends other then me, they all did things as couples leaving me out most the time. Even if I was with my friends I felt alone even though I wasnt.\n\nDue to my already current issues, I really lack self esteem and confidence in myself. I am always other thinking everything. I always think of the worst. I do try not to think this way but it is so difficult not too. This really hinders my dream of meeting someone, building a relationship with someone and falling in love. I finally in life want to have a proper personal, intimate significance in someones life. I have never had this before and  it's something I really want to happen one day\n\nAnyways due to my life getting stale after college I really had no idea what to pursue as a career. I took three years off just working and I hated it. So I made the decision to go to university to start to try and kickstart my life. To better myself and improve my self esteem and confidence. To meet new people and try to feel wanted. For sure I have made many many friends already and have had a brilliant time so far. But I am finding it so difficult being away from home, away from my friends at home and my family. I really like it here and all but I feel so alone even amongst my new friends. I often feel invisible and sometimes dont even feel alive. Some days I just stay in bed and do nothing cause depression and anxiety dictates my life. \n\nToday I feel so alone I want to cry and for my life to end. I have had enough of the feeling. These emotions have heightened because of what happened last night. I had a one night stand, for the first time in 15 months, which feels like forever. It was a uni social and I was very drunk so was she and we hit it off well and had sex which was great. For that moment I loved the company, I felt alive and wanted. It was fab, by all means I obviously caught some kind of feelings not necessarily for her but for the company and for the fact she made me feel not lonely. Of course one night stands come to an end the next day we wake up and lay in bed cuddling for a few hours chatting it was really nice, but the moment after she left it hit me. The loneliness. I havent felt more shit in a long time. I haven't had an intimate moment like that in a very long time, it was so refreshing and I am craving more. I haven't dated or really spoken to any girls for a long time due to my confidence, self esteem issues. To be honest I'm shocked she even got with me in the first place.\n\nTo conclude I'm a very confused person. I really dont understand my emotions or feelings that well at all. Life is an ongoing battle and I am sure one day things will improve and I wont feel lonely anymore. I have to keep strong, as that is all I can really do.", "subreddit": "lonely"}

It\u2019s hard to know what to say because I don\u2019t want to seem like everyone else (though they\u2019re trying to be positive) but it\u2019s really just the same thing different person. Maybe it\u2019s just me, and I know they mean it from a good place but anytime I build up courage to tell someone I\u2019m sad you get the same response \u201cjust keep your head up you\u2019ll be okay!\u201d. I know it sounds wrong but it\u2019s almost.. frustrating. Maybe because I\u2019ve heard it my whole life and it makes me want to scream \u201cWHEN?\u201d. I really try but it\u2019s genuinely so exhausting to try and use a statement as a way to be happy. It\u2019s just not what I want to hear and honestly I don\u2019t know what I would hear that could make it better. It\u2019s not other people\u2019s jobs to make someone feel better and I understand that, unless they\u2019re paid of course. I think it\u2019s hard though because my whole life I\u2019ve  always been there for everyone. Regardless of how I know them. If they tell me how they\u2019re feeling I just want to sit with them and really talk through things and try to make them feel better. And maybe it\u2019s selfish but I want that too yet those people aren\u2019t there for you if you need it and they don\u2019t have to be but I wish I deserved what I give to others too. I do more than just \u201cstay positive!\u201d Because I know it doesn\u2019t work like that. I know how incredibly hard it is. It seems impossible. Maybe this is dramatic to some but it\u2019s so real to me. Most of my life I\u2019ve been so sad. I definitely fake a smile when I\u2019m not alone to make others happy. My coworkers make me feel so down and I feel like they know I can\u2019t say anything so they don\u2019t care how it makes me feel. I can\u2019t say anything because one of those people is my manager and the other two that do it are favored by my manager. If I went above her head my manager would be talked to and they\u2019d be sure to make my life living hell or turn it on me so I loose my job. Which is not an option since I\u2019m 21, live on my own, pay all my own bills with no help or any type of aid due to me also pursuing my education full time.(not that I should but most do get help from family at this age). I can\u2019t look for another job quite yet until I graduate in December since most places can\u2019t work with my school schedule. I feel so trapped and I feel like they know and take advantage of it. I come home and just cry and repeat how much I want to die because there\u2019s no point in my life. I\u2019ve had to work and care for my self since I was very young. My past, like many, has a lot of trauma. So I work hard to try and not live in poverty forever or be homeless. I pay for my college so I can have a higher paying job because I want to have even more money saved up for emergencies and to retire but I think why? I only feel the need to do this stuff because I just want to not have to worry. It doesn\u2019t make me happy though. I honestly have no idea what makes me happy. I\u2019m not passionate about anything even though I want to be. I have no friends and I don\u2019t know how to make them because where I live people aren\u2019t very nice even if you are. I don\u2019t have any family that wants to see me or check on me. My mom was my absolute everything and she loved me very much but she passed away when I was 11. Now I only have a stranger of a dad and no matter how many times in several different ways I\u2019ve begged to have a relationship with him, he doesn\u2019t want that. It hurts to not have parents who love and care about you but most others do. I miss my mom so much and sometimes I figure if I die too maybe I would have to chance to be with her again if there\u2019s some type of afterlife and that sounds better than living. I do the things I do to exist.. I just don\u2019t know why when I don\u2019t have anything that brings me any joy. The loneliness wears on me and hurts physically. I just wish I had someone who truly loved and appreciated me whether it was family, friend or SO and someone I could love and appreciate too. I need companionship in some form and as humans that\u2019s something very normal to desire. I want someone to talk to and someone who tells and shows me they appreciate me. (This seems selfish but honestly anyone deserves this and I don\u2019t think that\u2019s a crazy thing to want) Yet I can\u2019t find it and I don\u2019t know how because everything I try never works. I feel defeated and I fear this will be the rest of my life and that\u2019s terrifying to me because I don\u2019t want to live it if that\u2019s true. I know this is so scrambled..I\u2019m just typing what comes to my brain to get it out and maybe someone will understand or it will help them. This is hard for me because I know people are going through worse and in the grand scheme of things my feelings don\u2019t really matter. It\u2019s just genuinely how I feel, it\u2019s not being said for sympathy. I\u2019m just so fucking sad. I wish I could hug all of you going through something.. I know people say it a lot and say this a lot but I really do understand how you feel and what you feel is completely validated. Excuse any grammatical of formatting errors I wasn\u2019t too worried about it since I just typed exactly what was in my head. I hope we\u2019re all not sad forever and if you actually read all this, thank you, I appreciate you.\ud83d\udc97", "subreddit": "lonely"}

I work with great people and I never remember how truly lonely I am when I\u2019m up there. We\u2019re all just the guys hanging out. We work 24 hours on and 48 off. Fast forward to now....\n\nI got home at 0715. I don\u2019t live far from work. I unlocked my door and took a deep breath of the somewhat stale air. It\u2019s normal for me to shut off my heating and air when I\u2019m gone. It just doesn\u2019t make any sense to leave it running for 24 hrs while I\u2019m gone. \n\nIt\u2019s quiet in here except for the hum of the Keurig making my morning coffee. While I wait, I take the opportunity to look at my phone and check on any notifications I may have. I\u2019ve been on Bumble and Tinder for about a week now. Still no matches....\n\nThe Keurig is done and I throw a little creamer into my coffee. It\u2019s started to get chilly outside. I\u2019m thankful that the weather is changing. The warm cup feels nice on my hands. I\u2019ve always despised the heat and humidity that comes with an Arkansas summer even though I don\u2019t know any different. I\u2019ve always lived in Arkansas but I was born and raised in a small town about an hour southeast of here. I moved up here to save money and time rather than commute almost every day for work. I thought that it would also be a change to expand my horizons and diversify my life a little bit. After all, I was moving from a small town of 10,000 to a bustling and growing city of around 300,000. \n\nAs I settle in on the couch with my coffee, I\u2019m starting to get a little unsettled by how quiet it is in here. The TV starts up the movie I had been watching the other night before I went to bed: Passengers. A flood of emotions comes running in. \n\n\u201cI\u2019m lonely too, Jim\u201d. I thought to myself. \n\nI can\u2019t help but wonder why things have turned out this way. Anyone that I meet or talk to, I believe, genuinely enjoys my company. I\u2019ve never met a stranger and I\u2019ve never had any problem talking to someone about anything. \n\n\u201cI need an Arthur to talk to just like Jim has on the Avalon\u201d. I joked. \n\nI do have an Arthur.....\n\nI grabbed my phone and opened up Reddit where thousands upon thousands of people post every day about everything. \n\nThe whole reason I was driven to write and post was because I felt lonely and I wanted to vent. I start to wonder what subreddit would it be most acceptable to write and share how I\u2019m feeling. On a whim, I typed lonely into the search bar and, of course, the first result that popped up was r/lonely. In here, there\u2019s thousands of people who feel exactly how I do. Maybe they need an Arthur as well. I don\u2019t want anyone to feel like they\u2019re completely alone. Sometimes people just need to vent. \n\nI\u2019m going to tell them a story about how I feel....so I began to tyoe....\n\nHello, my name is Arthur", "subreddit": "lonely"}
{"post_id": "dmxuwz", "created_utc": 1572012044, "title": "Another Night", "author": "SoCalSoLost", "self_text": "One of the few positive things I have going for me is my physical health. I walk/light jog 5-7 miles per day. Sunday - Wednesday I go on my walk anytime; same route every day. The route is through and downtown area and runs along the Pacific Ocean\u2014 so it\u2019s a nice view. \n\nThursday-Saturday, I only go early morning. I know that by going in the afternoon, evening or night, I\u2019ll encounter crowds. The crowds themselves aren\u2019t the problem, but the smiling, joyful people within the crowds are. Prior to altering my walking schedule, there had been times when I literally would cry after seeing all of the friends and couples having such a good time. Thousands of people; not a single one notices me. I\u2019ve managed to get somewhat of a hold on this by avoiding it. \n\nOnce per week I go against my avoidance rule. I get dressed, do my hair and actually get the confidence to go to one of these popular places. I go hungry because I want to be sure I have a reason to be there, just in case I see someone I used to work with or a neighbor\u2014 I can say \u201chey just grabbing a bite to eat\u201d and not seem like a lonely lurker\u2014 which is exactly what I am doing. \n\nLike the walks prior to me changing my schedule, I just end up in tears. I\u2019ve perfected how I hide this. The feeling of sadness takes over the moment I pay my check and realize, \u201cAgain. No one.\u201d The pressure in my chest builds, as it is now as I type this. As many of you may know, that pressure slowly (but quickly) pushes up through your lungs, into your throat and eventually into the back of your eyes. Once there, the pressure exits in the form of tears. This is when I\u2019ll look down at my pants and pretend to be digging for something in my pocket, while fighting the tears. Is it just me, or do you feel like crying more when you\u2019re fighting back your tears?\n\nSo last night, before I head out, I tell myself this has to be it. This has to be the last time I do this and I have to make it work. I can\u2019t keep getting dressed up and spending money just to end up home alone. For all that, I can just stay home and order in and save time and money. Sure, I\u2019ll still be in tears and upset, but in the privacy of my own place; I didn\u2019t have to get dressed up, and it\u2019s not costing me as much. \n\nI went to a popular bar/restaurant called \u201cTequila Jacks.\u201d I walked by a table of two women, my age. One looked at me, but I think it was more of just a natural reaction to someone walking by. I thought to myself, \u201cJust smile and say hi.\u201d I did neither. I continued to the bar where I ordered a drink and a meal. Nearby, three gorgeous women are having drinks at a table for four. An open seat. An easy in. My food arrived fairly quickly. I ate and noticed that a fourth lady showed up and sat with the rest of the ladies. I still thought that this is fine; just introduce yourself to them all. Tell a stupid joke. Do anything. I recall thinking, \u201cEither leave here crying because you did nothing. Or leave her crying because you were rejected. Either way, you\u2019re crying, so you may as well just talk to them.\u201d \n\nOkay. No problem. I\u2019m finally ready to do it. The bartender asks if I\u2019ll be having anything else. I tell him know and I get my check. I knew I wasn\u2019t leaving. I keep looking in the ladies\u2019 direction and one of them seems to be looking in mine. They are maybe 15 feet from me at their high-top table. I knew I could be funny so I had that on my side. I knew that even in the worst scenario, I can make a few jokes and leave then cry alone after. So what\u2019s to lose? \n\nI add a tip to the bill. Sign it. Drop the pen on the bar, sip my drink one last time and look in their direction. Here it goes. I stand up. Look in their direction. Take a deep breath and sigh. Next, I turn away and exit the bar. The pressure in my chest mounts and as I walked away from doing nothing, I just looked down and fiddled with my pockets until the tears stopped. \n\nI called a Lyft and got home about ten mins later. I cried myself to sleep and woke up several times throughout the night. Each time, facing the empty side of the bed. A reminder that I\u2019m here alone. I reminder that I once had love and ruined it. A reminder that I\u2019m destined to have no one. Not a friend. Not a lover. And nothing in between. Just a lonely man who has perfected hiding his tears from the public. \n\nThank you for reading.", "subreddit": "lonely"}

kindergarten). as a child i didn't put much thought into it, my best friends were my siblings and we hung out all the time, and i wasn't fully aware that other kids would form proper friendships. i guess when i was around 10 i first started caring about the fact that i might appear as a \"loner\" due to the fact that i never had genuine friends. i went to a small primary school, so i did have \"friends\" per se (although they all disliked and mistreated me for no apparent reason, which now looking back might be the root of my issues), but i rarely got invited over to their house or to hang out in general.\n\nneedless to say when i left primary school i was hopeful that in middle school i'd blossom into this social butterfly and have real friends i could hang out with. didn't end up happening though, of course. i was the outsider of the class. some people tried to welcome me into their group but always ended up \"giving up\" after a while, so i was always left on my own. another girl then started targeting me and would make fun of me daily. she'd often talk shit about me while i was right next to her; she made it obvious because she knew it would hurt even more. she was cruel, but she wasn't \"brutal\" so to speak, but i was very weak mentally and became depressed and started skipping school. the last month or so of 7th grade i didn't go to school at all. when school started again in 8th grade i tried to go back to school, i really did, but the first day i broke down before even going to class and my classmates saw me and tried to \"cheer\" me up, but they got annoyed and left. i then got homeschooled for the rest of 8th grade, barely went outside, only around once a week to go talk with a social assistant. we'd go for walks or to a place where you could make art with clay. honestly, i didn't enjoy it at all. i felt like a worthless reject of society, who was so broken that she'd have to do all these \"crazy people activities\" (i'd like to say that these thoughts were very ignorant, but as a 12/13 year old person there's nothing you want to be more than to be what is considered normal, and sadly in our society these kinds of programs are looked down upon most of the time). in comparison to my other school years, high school has been pretty good. i became friends with a girl after around 1 month and we're still relatively close today, though we never hang out outside of school anymore. nevertheless, the first 2/3 years were hard (side note: where i'm from we have 5 years of high school) at times, as my little group was always left out of the class community. i'd like to think that i've grown a lot and have made immense improvements these last 1.5 years, but i often realize that although i can now talk to anyone in my class freely and not be completely awkward, i'm still so so so lonely. my sister is my only real friend, i text with her everyday and we can talk about everything and laugh for hours, but other than that i don't really have true friends. i've noticed that although i really try, people never seem to give me a chance. i'm always \"the quiet one\" and i can never free myself of that label, people always see me as boring or weird, they never even consider being my friend and i genuinely don't understand why. i might be a bit different than most people where i live, simply because everyone is more or less the same in a way, but i'm not THAT different. i just.. don't understand. sometimes i kind of forget about this aching pain that being lonely causes, then i get reminded of how other people have LOTS of friends, close friends, best friends. they seem to have a friend for every occasion. it baffles me. i don't need 100 friends, i just wish i had a tiny friend group that truly understood &amp; cared about me the same way i'd care about them. i can come off as cold, but i have soo much love to give, it's just hard to express it :( and honestly, i wouldn't even need super close friends to be people i know irl, i'd be more than happy if it was a person living across the world, just as long as we truly understood and accepted each other as we are. in my darkest times i had lots of online friends, but nowadays i'm too anxious to even form friendships online. of course, ideally speaking, i would love to meet a true best friend irl, but the way things seem to be going for me irl that won't happen anytime soon.. sigh. i don't know how to end this, i feel like i could continue ranting on forever, but i'm just getting more depressed right now.\n\nanyway, sending you guys lots of love and i hope you have a great day. you're a great person and deserve to be happy, remember that &lt;3", "subreddit": "lonely"}

It's the first time I've had to do so many things myself. It's been a huge learning curve, gaining independence, navigating simple things, starting my own business and working for myself. \n\nAt first I thought I was going to die from being alone, I couldn't comprehend it. My depression and anxiety were so bad that I would walk to the hospital almost daily just to feel safe from myself. But slowly I adjusted and learned to love living alone, I made my home mine, and I'm happy with my living situation. I live in a really cute and safe neighborhood.\n\nThe issue with my job is I work in people's homes, and they usually aren't there. So I spend about 95% of my life without in person human contact.\n\nThe loneliness is starting to suffocate me. I'm so scared of being vulnerable to people that I'm not able to put myself out there. When we moved from Vancouver to Montreal in 2011, I had to leave my incredible friends and I haven't been able to find new ones that feel the same. If it wasn't for our daughter I would be completely alone, but even then she's in college now and is busy with her own life. \n\nWinter is coming and the thought of being trapped inside and alone for another season is so depressing I can't bear it. Every couple months I attempt to date but it never seems to work out and I'm beginning to get a bit of a complex about it.\n\nI'm a good person, I'm honest and great at communicating and I love to be silly and laugh. I'm very open and loving, and I feel like I have a lot to offer. Aside from the weight I've gained from being a hermit, I think I'm pretty date-able. \n\nI try to stay connected with people by texting, but it's become clear I text too much and people get a bit annoyed by me. So I joined discord but don't know enough about it to be able to find friends. I don't have many hobbies and often get halfway through projects and lose interest. \n\nI miss love. I miss touch. I miss connection. I miss sex. I miss laughing until I cry. I miss adventures. I miss being around somebody but doing my own thing. \n\nSo if you're in Montreal or nearby and need a friend, PM me. If you don't, but you love hip hop, rap, watching YouTube (vlog squad, Shane, Jenna &amp; Julien, etc), or 420, go ahead and PM me.  \n\nI really need to feel connected again, and like I'm not wasting my life.

It's okay if you don't feel like reading it all, at least I got to vent a little. If you do read it, thank you so much!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI am twenty years old and I'm in my second year of college and I never made any college friends. I am very sad to see all the people I went to high school with moving on with their lives and making new friends and having a good time when I feel so stuck. My best friend from high school, who was just as awkward as me in high school, goes to a different college from me and seems to have really come out of her shell and didn't have nearly the struggle I've had. We are still good friends and talk quite often, but I am so afraid that she is moving on from me and will one day abandon me. But anyway, I have been doing a lot of soul searching in the last year and I've been seeing a therapist. I dug up some old memories of past friendships from my life that I think impacted my ability to make friends.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI became friends with my high school friend mentioned above when we were in tenth grade and my mom told me that she was the first friend of mine that she has actually liked because all of my other friends have been very bossy people with strong personalities. At the time, I noticed that she was right, but I had no idea why all my past friends were so terrible. I should mention that my best friend was also my only friend when she said this, so she wasn't talking trash about people I was still friends with. All the toxic friends I've had have been out of my life since tenth grade. I won't go into every single friend who treated me like garbage, because I honestly don't feel like typing it all out and you probably don't feel like reading it, so I'll summarize some of the ones that weren't as bad as the ones I'll go into detail for. A lot of them talked to me at school when it was convenient for them and accepted me into their friend group, but I always felt like the last kid picked for the team whenever everyone was in a group. And they almost always forgot to invite me when our whole friend group hung out together outside of school. Nobody ever texted me or asked about my life. And when I realized how left out that made me feel, I ditched them as friends and none of them noticed. Or if they did, they didn't care enough to do anything about it. But here are some of the most damaging people I have been friends with.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis girl, I'll call her B, was friends with me from kindergarten to fourth grade and was the most toxic person I have ever met. And for those of you who think it's impossible for an elementary schooler to be toxic because they are so young, you are wrong and your belief is part of the problem. Young people can be cruel and the victims of that cruelty deserve to be taken seriously. But that's an entirely different rant that I won't elaborate on. So B had a very strange family situation. Her mom had two kids, both with different dads, and for most of the time I was friends with B, her mom was married to a man that B believed was her biological father. She called him dad and had his last name. But the summer before we started fourth grade, her mom and this man had a very messy divorce. I don't know all the details, but the man apparently broke into their house after he had stopped living there and they had to install security cameras. B changed her last name to her mother's original last name and I assume (I don't keep in touch with her, so I have no idea) that she hasn't seen him since. Her mom also didn't seem to understand moderation. Their house was really big and had a tv in every room, including the garage, and they had six dogs. Sorry if you think that has nothing to do with this story, I just wonder if her family situation has anything to do with how she was as a person.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nB and I went to a small Catholic school and neither of us had any friends in kindergarten for the first few weeks of school until we met each other. And for most of our time being friends, we didn't have anyone else because there were so few options. Every year of our friendship, we would get in fights about the most stupid, petty things. For example, there was this girl, I'll call her H, who didn't have a lot of friends and I eventually became decent friends with her and sometimes sat next to her at lunch instead of sitting by B. If I didn't sit next to H, she would sit alone. One day, I promised H that I would sit next to her tomorrow. The next morning, B told me she had cake in her lunch and she was going to share it with me. I was excited to have cake at lunch for the whole day. When lunchtime came around, I sat next to H like I promised, not thinking it was a problem. I walked over to where B was sitting and asked her for cake and she told me I couldn't have any because I was sitting next to H. I thought this was stupid and got mad and she got mad at me for getting mad and we didn't speak to each other for at least a few days. We got in fights like these about once every week or two, but none of them ever ended our friendship because I felt like I didn't have the power to do it. I remember writing in my diary at the time that we got in one of our biggest fights to date and I was optimistic that this could end things, but it never did. We were still friends at the end of fourth grade and she switched schools for the next year and we never saw each other again. But here's a list of other things she did to me:\n\nShe told me that one day she was going to bring duct tape to school to cover my mouth because I was so annoying and I don't think she was joking, because every day, she would give me updates about how she couldn't find any in her house and she was asking her mom to buy more.\n\nShe tried her best to seem more grown up than everyone else because she was the first person to get an iPod and a cell phone (this was in the mid 2000s) and was always in competition with me for who knew more lyrics to the pop songs on the radio. Her mom owned a day care that she helped out at and she got paid for it, so I guess you could say it was a job, but every time she started a story with, \"yesterday, at WORK,\" I knew she wanted to say \"at work\" as much as possible because that's what the adults said. And these things worked because I always felt like a baby around her.\n\nShe told me I was a bad friend for telling my mom about our fights because I was \"talking behind her back,\" so I kept our fights a secret. She also convinced me that if I talked to our teacher, then I was going to get in trouble, so no adult ever knew about our problems.\n\nOnce when I was really mad at her and didn't want to talk, I sat down on the bus and opened a book, but she sat next to me and said, \"I want to talk to you.\" I ignored her and she said, \"Whatever. I'll just make you talk like I always do. I can make you do anything.\"\n\nI failed a test that she got a perfect score on and when I expressed that I was upset, she said, \"boo hoo for you.\"\n\nI don't know how she managed to do this, but she convinced me that I held about 50% of the blame for our problems and I believed this until less than a year ago. Admittedly, I could have handled the fights much better, but I don't think that means it was my fault, because I was so young and I didn't feel like I could get any guidance from adults. I don't think about this era of my life that often, and I don't get emotional over it, but last winter, I was doing a memoir project for one of my classes, and while I was thinking about my life to get ideas, suddenly the fog cleared and everything made sense. I suddenly learned so much about myself just by making the realization that for some of the most important developmental years socially, I was the victim of a toxic friendship. And all the other people who followed B who also treated me terribly probably picked up on the fact that I am submissive and therefore an easy target. I never learned what friendship is supposed to be until high school, and I realize that all these years, I have built a barrier around myself because I would rather never let anyone in than risk getting hurt again. I don't trust anyone and I can't open up because I am so afraid that I will get hurt. And I don't know how to choose my friends because it's not like toxic people are blatant b\\*tches. I can deal with b\\*tches, but it's so much harder to deal with manipulative people who who change your perception of yourself and make you believe you are worthless. I believe this is why I have no friends at college. I think I need to overcome B and all the other people in my past who made me feel worthless and ruined my childhood and gave me crippling social anxiety. I need to learn how to be vulnerable, but I'm so afraid.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nB, if you're reading this (I doubt she is, but whatever), you know who you are, I have no idea where you are in life and I forgive how you treated me in elementary school, but I need to recognize how damaging it was for me so I can break free.", "subreddit": "lonely"}

I'm going through a pretty difficult phase of depression and loneliness so I was wondering if anyone minded sharing songs that they like to listen to when they're feeling depressed. If I can share a few here is my two cents:\n\n- The whole album \"17\" by XXXTentacion is really good to listen to if you're ever feeling depressed (my favourite song is Carry On)\n\n- \"Je vis, je visser\" and \"Oh lala\" by the french rap group PNL are pretty good, I would highly recommend to check the lyrics and the whole universe that PNL created if you're not familiar with it (they are two ex-drug dealers who have gone through depression and suicidal phase). \n\n- \"\u00c9ternit\u00e9\" by Jazzy Bazz &amp; Nekfeu, a pretty solid song with good lyrics, I would also recommend to check the lyrics, they are pretty optimistic and it is good to hear sometimes.\n\n- \"Andr\u00e9\" &amp; \"C'est tout\" by Guizmo, really emotional songs about the past of the rapper (he has been addicted to weed, alcohol and was homeless for some time)\n\n- Both \"10 d\u00e9cembre\" and \"Kiwibunnylove\" by the french rapper Nelick, very good songs about the feeling of being lonely for the first, and doubt for the second.\n\nI hope that these songs will lift you up a bit, sorry if most of the songs are in French cause it's my native language.

Context: my partner also has to commute for work and this was our mid-point.\n\nWe currently have no friends in this town. Its typically for young families and is a commuter town. It's not a place for young professionals in their 20s. I had a slightly rough start to this new job, my immediate coworker slash mentor is an introvert who likes to keep work and friendships separate and who prefers to work through lunch to go home early; and two other female graduates in my wider department but different team are cliquey and rejected all of my attempts to lunch together, talk, meet up after work, get a coffee together etc.\n\nI had given up, I was resigned to being alone out of the house for 10 hours until I could see my partner in the evening again and felt the same familiar wave of \"why is it always me who is alone?\". What came after I did not expect. My boss extends a - figurative - hand. He organises two coffee trips for our team. If he is not in the office he calls me briefly to make sure I have work and I know what to do and I'm okay. He has arranged two pub trips and facilitated conversations between his number 2 (my senior colleague) and I so we all have a good rapport now and we talk about our partners and hobbies and children and I'm not alone even though I'm 10-30 years younger than everyone on my team.\n\nAs a bonus, I threw myself into the annual work office party despite knowing nobody. I spoke to 5 people and they were nice and engaging with me. I joined the work board game club and we played a game where you vote for the funniest person and they all picked me.\n\nFinally I'm not alone or the odd one out.

{"post_id": "dnh8jw", "created_utc": 1572112230, "title": "losing my motivation again... m21", "author": "Late-Homework", "self_text": "Hello people of Reddit, I\u2019m not really sure what I hope to get out of this because it\u2019s just going to be a rant on how I\u2019m feeling but oh well here we go. \n\nThis shouldn\u2019t come as a shock to anyone reading this but I am very lonely. I just recently turned 21 and I have never been in a relationship before. I never went on a single date in high school and didn\u2019t have my first kiss until college, which I\u2019ll be graduating in May. \n\nI\u2019ve got pretty low self esteem and self confidence because I got bullied in middle school and high school. I\u2019ll give you all en example: freshman year of high school I was playing GTA5 with some friends on Xbox. I went to go eat dinner and left my mic on mute, when I came back I forgot it was on mute and I heard them talking about me. They were talking about a picture someone had taken of me earlier that day and they said I looked \u201cugly and inhuman.\u201d To this day I really don\u2019t like having my picture taken. \n\nNow I look better than I did in middle school / high school for sure but I still struggle with my appearance a lot. I\u2019ve tried using dating apps because it\u2019s hard for me to approach girls in person but they\u2019ve really only made things worse. I\u2019ve used a combination of 4 dating apps over the past 4 years and I\u2019ve averaged 1-2 matches a month. That\u2019s with swiping right on over 200 people/day until I ran out of people in my area and eventually made new accounts to try again. Meanwhile my friends with the same dating apps will have 70+ matches and have 99+ people liking them. All of my friends and family say that I am smart, funny, witty, and have a good personality so it doesn\u2019t take a genius to figure out why nobody is liking me. \n\nAs I mentioned before, I recently turned 21. I\u2019m a senior in college so obviously I\u2019ve been drinking before but I don\u2019t enjoy it so turning 21 wasn\u2019t a huge milestone for me. I did however want to do something with my friends though. I mentioned my birthday coming up for months and when it came down to it nobody hit me up to do anything. Even my own roommates ended up leaving me alone in the apartment to go watch a basketball game. I ended up eating dinner at the university cafeteria after my last class and bought myself a pie on the way home. It was probably my least favorite birthday. \n\nThe combination of my birthday on Tuesday and what happened with my last match on bumble has really started to bum me out again. We matched on birthday funny enough and ended up talking for the next three days. I honestly don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever connected with someone so well and I was genuinely excited every time I would get a notification from her. Everything ended abruptly when she found out I had some conservative views and she doesn\u2019t associate with people like that. I was really taken back by it and I still find it hard to believe people take politics so seriously. I\u2019m not even a die-hard far right conservative, I\u2019m more towards the middle. Anyway it was just the icing on the cake and I\u2019ve deleted all my dating profile accounts now. \n\nThis is turning into a long read but if you\u2019ve made it this far then props to you buddy. Anyway I can feel myself starting to slip back into a pretty depressed state and it scares me. All my life I\u2019ve gone through what I call periods of feeling good and feeling pretty depressed. I\u2019m not the \u201cI have self diagnosed depression please give me attention type.\u201d I very rarely will talk with my friends or family about how I\u2019m feeling because I genuinely don\u2019t think they care and I feel it would be pointless which is why I found myself here to rant. But going back, when I\u2019m feeling depressed all I can think about is how my life has gone so far. That ranges from things people have said about me over the years which keep me up at night to never having been in a relationship before. I\u2019m 21 years old now, if I live to be 100 that\u2019s a fifth of my life already over and I feel it was all meaningless. I\u2019ve come pretty close to killing myself three times in the past and I\u2019ll probably end up going through with it once I graduate college. \n\nThe first time was in my junior year of college. My sister was taking pictures of me at home and I don\u2019t remember why but it was genuinely upsetting me. I tried getting her phone so that I could delete them but she locked herself in her room. My mom came into the hallway to see what was going on and I ended up punching a hole in the wall. My mom screamed and the look of disappoint on her face really hit me because I love my mom. I ended up fixing the hole in the wall but I felt like such a disappointment to my mom and I didn\u2019t have anything else going for me I just wanted to kill myself. I heavily thought it over so the following months but ended up not going through with it. I\u2019m also not a very angry person, the outburst was really uncharacteristic of me and in the last 5.5-6 years nothing like that has ever happened again. \n\nThe second time was after I graduated high school. I got accepted to a university out of state and I decided that\u2019s where I wanted to go. I wanted to get away from all the negativity I associate home with (except my family) but I was afraid that everything would be the same. I was going to shoot myself at the end of the summer but a couple of friends of mine noticed I wasn\u2019t really myself and had a mini intervention for me. I brushed it off but it did convince me to do to college. \n\nThe third time I don\u2019t have a story like the last two. I just happened to be going through a really bad period and it just didn\u2019t seem worth it anymore. \n\nI am so lonely and just want someone to spend my life with. I want to hold hands, go on dates, or just do something simple like go grocery shopping together. It\u2019s so hard watching my friends go in and out of being in relationships over the years. Two of my best friends are now even in long term relationships where they live with their girlfriends. I\u2019m at a weird age in my life where I\u2019ve got friends who are in long term relationships, friend who are still new to their relationships, friends who talk about just hooking up with girls, and then there is me who does none of that. I\u2019m not even interested in one night stands but I\u2019m sure it would be nice to have a connection for even that short period of time. \n\nI don\u2019t have the motivation to care about anything anymore. I\u2019ve got a 3.5 GPA and my grades mean nothing to me now. I have a nice car and with my degree I\u2019ll be making close to 6 figures right out of college but the money doesn\u2019t mean anything to me. I just want to be happy. I said before I\u2019ll probably wait until after college to off myself and that\u2019s because I at least want to get my degree to make my mom and dad proud. They both weren\u2019t fortunate enough to go through college so I know it would mean a lot to them. \n\nI don\u2019t think I covered this before but I\u2019m not a super loner with no friends, in fact I don\u2019t really have a problem making friends at all. I know my friends seem kinda shitty for leaving me alone in my birthday but they\u2019re not bad people and I don\u2019t hold it against them. My friends form back home wished me happy birthday and so did my ones here. And no, I\u2019m not still friends with the two who bullied me in high school from my story before. \n\nI think this brings us to the end of my rant. Not sure if this helped me any but we made it to the end, thanks for reading I guess", "subreddit": "lonely"}

At that point, I had found what I thought was a perfect match. I was in love, but she wasn't and she broke it off via text with the \"it's not you, it's me\" thing. Since then, I've tried basically everything and I don't know what's wrong with me. It's gotta be something, though?\n\nI've contemplated and/or fantasized several options in the past year, hoping for some relief from the pain of loneliness due to my lack of companionship.\n\nSuicide - I keep coming back to this. I know that it's a permanent solution, and people say it's not a solution because it doesn't make you feel better it stops you from feeling anything, but that's why it's so attractive. I WOULDN'T feel the pain anymore. I think the only reason I haven't is because some part of me is hopeful. I don't know what will happen when that part of me finally gives up or succumbs to hopelessness. \n\nCastration - Chemical or otherwise, in hopes that it somehow would affect my need for companionship. However, I know that it's not a sexual need and I haven't found any data discussing its connection (if any) with loneliness, so I've tossed that idea out.\n\nChange my sexuality - In short, somehow make myself gay. I know a few gay men that have expressed that they were attracted to me physically and mentally. I know that sexuality is not a choice, but the irrational part of me tried anyway. It didn't work.\n\nSettle or lower/remove my standards - I unfortunately found that if a potential companion does not meet my mental standards I have incredible difficulty even being friends with them, let alone building a relationship. As far as physical standards, I've dropped them to \"do they appear to take care of their bodies?\". Still no luck.\n\nStop caring or looking/focus on myself - If you can tell me how, please...\n\nTherapy - I've tried several therapists. None of them have tried to do anything but listen.

I'm typically in so much pain - fingers to lower back - I exercise less. If you have back problems you start to feel like you've had the shit kicked out of you all day. \n\nI clean, eat a big dinner, and collapse into bed. It takes huge amounts of energy just to fucking shower. \n\n...And then another horrible day starts anew. \n\nIt's been asked so many times - what is there to live for, FA? To look forward to, what makes life bearable?\n\nThose of you in your 30s know what I'm talking about. You have no \"friends\" and if you did, they're all married with kids or just don't give a fuck about you. I've had to cut friends out of my life that I knew didn't value me, who say shit they never do to people they value, or at a minimum, respect, whose outlook of me is mostly informed by being with me while semi intoxicated at a party with normies and hipsters like them. \n\nI have some friends from high school I see maybe once a year or two if I'm lucky if someone invites me to a party. I'll admit it - the fact I have so little in common with them just makes it so hard. \n\n\nIf you're FA - and if you're ashamed of your life - if you hate your job, if your coworkers aren't particularly close to you, if you have no friendships where people include you, and worst of all, if you do but you beg off because you're too back-busted tired or broken out or depressed to bear being around people when they call spontaneously (lol, I don't have that problem anymore), even if you know they might not even text you again for 12 months...there is nothing to look forward to.\n\nIf you have relationships even your friendships are \"shallow\" and fucking desperate. You hate begging off the rare invite because - unlike a normie - it won't come again. And if you're in your 30s this is even truer because people simply *do not give a shit*. Friendship is generally less important except for the select circle of adult friends who will probably be like them. \n\nI haven't been a person that can talk about anything but my shitty, worthless job (and it is a job in every sense, not a career, and definitely not paid like a career) and watching \"Family Guy\" reruns or something since high school (when, fittingly, I felt much the same - it truly is a living hell being young and seeing how exciting the lives of good-looking people are, while you, by comparison, sit home alone on Fridays thinking you'll have to hang yourself in your closet if you fail your next test because your grades are tanking). \n\nI haven't had a person I could text just to talk or felt comfortable with someone one on one since that time. I can't imagine being alone with a single friend one on one to go look at something (spend money I don't have) and talk. \n\n\nI don't have any other thoughts that aren't about this, the FA condition, being unhealthy, failures, problems I can't fix, my lack of willpower, the horrible anxiety to self-optimize just to live a mediocre life, feeling impotent in a furiously evil world, and various dignities of the day, like what rank douchebags people are in a shared space and what an inconsiderate self-absorbed prick the average person is, glued to their phones, completely oblivious to anyone around them. \n\n...There's no relief. \n\nHonestly even if someone invited me to a wedding or something tomorrow, all I could think is about how much money I'd have to spend, and how fucking UGLY I'd look around all the inevitably beautiful women, and being alone - the ugliest, most awkward and miserable member of the member of the wedding party. A girlfriend got married in Ireland two years ago when I was working in a contract job and I said I couldn't take off work - the truth is, I couldn't afford it.\n\nI still can't believe I missed a chance to see someone I care about get married and enjoy Ireland with a friend. Jesus Christ. And even if I had the income for it - it's a chance that'll never come again. \n\nIf you relate, I'm listening. \n\nIt's a week before Halloween and all I can think about is, I wish I were 10 or 11 again and had the stamina to go somewhere on a fucking weeknight, and didn't have a shitty job to go to tomorrow. \n\nI wish I were another person entirely and had peaks in my life, people to share that with, and a life worth sharing at all, instead of an existence pacing a holding cell.", "subreddit": "ForeverAlone"}

These are very few and far between in my area and only about 100-150 people go to these things. I talked with a few people platonically and a lot of people complimented my cosplay (I cosplayed as Joker from Persona 5). I got asked for a few pictures which is new to me. \n\nI saw a lot of girls there who were cosplaying Danganronpa characters and I fucking love Danganronpa and they were cute, so I asked for pictures from them and they all let me take pictures. That was cool. We talked about the series and all that, pretty baseline conversations about the franchise and such. I wanted to get to know them more and stuff, but didn't want to come off as creepy so I just ended up walking away from all of them when the conversation died down. I really wanted to ask more personal stuff or flirt with them, but I have absolutely no game and I figure these girls would rather just have fun here than get hit on by some random asshole who is probably too old for them anyways (26). I feel very afraid of talking to women in this way because of #MeToo and well, I'm FA.\n\nWent and talked to random other people who caught my eye, the security guard came over to me and insisted that I enter the cosplay competition, so I did. I was worried that someone complained about me, but nah he was just a friendly dude who likes Persona. I didn't win the competition, but it was fun. I encouraged one of the girls I talked to earlier since she looked pretty nervous. She thanked me and went on stage. She didn't win either, but I could tell she was less nervous.\n\nPretty bland story, I know. But this is about as much socialization as I get before I have to go home and recharge. I guess I'm glad I went and had some manner of fun and breaking out of my bubble, but I'm disappointed that after today, nothing will have changed. I didn't make any friends or have any sort of bond form. I don't really know how to close the distance on making friends from these types of events. All the conversations seem very superficial, even if it's about media we like or have bonds to.\n\nSorry for the venting thread.

A drunk driver hit my car and totaled it and then the guy ran away. Thankfully, I wasn\u2019t injured.\n\n\nI wanted to tell me friends individually. I wasn\u2019t driving my own car, it was my moms car. I was just starting to learn how to drive and this is probably gonna scare me for a bit out of driving.\n\n\n\nAnyways, the next morning, I wanted to tell some friends since it\u2019s pretty damn important. The first person I tell, just holy shit. For a bit of context, I\u2019m 18 and we are internet friends for 5 years now. Although we never officially dated, we would always talk about what would happen if we lived closer. We even did the stupid contract of, \u201cif you\u2019re 30 and I\u2019m 30, let\u2019s get married\u201d. I seriously sacrificed so much for this girl. I rejected other women and would convince myself to not have a crush so she could be my first girlfriend despite her being in tons of other relationships. It was mostly manipulation on her side, as in anytime I would tell her about a girl I found attractive, she would tell me how she would feel sad if we stopped talking or just point out tiny flaws for me to not like the person, just generally terrible things.\n\nWe told each other off earlier this summer but I reignited it (it was for a stupid reason. Her birthday came up and I had a gift ready which was a website about her and she wants to be friends again). I thought things would be different but apparently not...\n\nI texted her about what happened and she seemed to be worried, saying the usual stuff like \u201care you okay?\u201d and what not. But I swear to you, just out of nowhere, she brings up how her and this boy had sex...for no reason whatsoever. I wasn\u2019t even done talking, she just interrupted me and told me that for no reason. She was the girl I used to love and someone I sacrificed 5 years I could\u2019ve been dating other people for, all down the drain, I didn\u2019t wanna hear about her having sex, especially not after this car crash. I just told her I didn\u2019t want to hear it and she seemed really ticked off I said that.\n\n\nThe second person is someone I recently met, so of course I kinda didn\u2019t expect this person to care as much as the first person. But just...they changed the subject to this party they wanted to attend before they asked if I was hurt. It\u2019s so damn frustrating, I felt like I could\u2019ve at least opened up a little bit more to this person instead of the other girl I mentioned, but I guess they didn\u2019t wanna hear much.\n\n\nThe third person I told is also pretty similar to the first person. While I didn\u2019t get hurt, I felt a little bit of pain from the whiplash of the seatbelt hitting my stomach. As soon as I was finished explaining that, she just went on about this boy she met and how much she wants him sexually. It was just so damn jarring, I didn\u2019t know how to respond and said some awkward words and walked away.\n\n\n\nI\u2019ve had this problem for so long. I don\u2019t know how to have people that care about me. I know I\u2019m not hurt from the crash which is really important, but I could\u2019ve been and I would\u2019ve had no one to depend on or talk to. I don\u2019t think I\u2019ll talk to these people for a long time, this has already made a stressful situation just so much worse.", "subreddit": "lonely"}

I just wanted to share my feelings and opinion towards love. I am not, in any case, trying to be edgy, dark or something, it is just that I don't really believe to the myth of love. (And no, I don't write this because I'm heartbroken or because somebody cheated on me, I just write it because I'm genuinely curious to know if anybody shares the same feeling).\n\nI think that love is something that doesn't last on the scale of a lifetime. I mean, take a look at married couples who are 40-50 years old. Is it the same love that when they got married ? I think people don't really love each other after a certain period of time, varying for each individual. After some time, there is a routine that makes all days looks the same and slowly fades the once passionate love away. Love transforms into a sort of compassion and a kind of \"well, since we're established together let's try to make the following years good for each other even if we don't really love us anymore\" feeling.\n\nThere is a lot more divorces (in Switzerland where I'm from, there is 1 divorce for 1.95 marriage, which means that over one marriage out of two ends with a divorce), there are less mariages and people makes less babies, probably because they don't want to engage themselves too much in a relationship because they know that love doesn't last a lifetime. Even if I look at my parents (I'm an 18M, they're both 49) it feels more like an old friendship with more compassion than a regulart friendship but it feels nothing like love.\n\nDoes anybody shares the same feeling towards the impermanency of love ? I feel like love is a flower, sometimes that is really beautiful when it blossoms, when you first encounter it but it wither really fast after that. Maybe people get together because of the fear of being alone or stay together because of old social constructs (divorce is still seen badly in some country).\n\nSorry if this post is a bit pessimistic, I'm in no way trying to discourage anybody to find love, I'm just sharing my pov. I'm also pretty torn between the feeling that love is a myth and the sickness of being alone all the time. I don't knoe if being with someone would make things better, maybe as a short time reliever.

Feel free to PM me.\n\nI think love and relationships are 100% an emotional need. People keep talking about how you need to be happy alone before getting into a relationship, but I don't think most people can be happy by themselves. A romantic relationship may not be a need like food or water, but it is a need for an overwhelming majority of people.\n\nIf people could be happy on their own without a relationship, why would they bother emotionally and mentally committing themselves to one, and possibly risk getting hurt or breaking up when it can be more painful than being alone on the first place?\n\nYour feelings are 100% valid because it's in us biologically to want love. There's no denying it. Also when it comes to wanting to be with someone, nobody should be told to lower their standards (within reason) to be able to get someone. Having standards is a necessary foundation for any healthy relationship. Having no standards can and will result in heartbreaking and abusive relationships.\n\nI know that it can hurt, and that I have no idea what you all are going through, but no matter your situation, I'm here to talk.", "subreddit": "ForeverAlone"}

So in high school I was what most people would  consider \u201cpopular\u201d, I didn\u2019t really care much but I loved high school. The one thing that bothered me was when it was my senior year, I realized I never had a solid friend group. Like during lunch, I never had an exact group to go to, I\u2019d literally go from group to group (after a while you feel like you have no position in the group so you go to the next one). Not that I had trouble making friends, I was very social but my situation was always I\u2019d meet someone new or a group of people and I\u2019d become super close to them but the friendship would usually last about less than year (no friendships ever ended on bad terms we just went different paths). I kid you not this literally happened to me every year of high school and now I\u2019m in college and I feel so lonely, like I don\u2019t have a group of friends. I\u2019ve always envied those with friend groups where everyone gets along. I do have \u201cfriends\u201d from high school but if I\u2019m being honest I feel as if I only get hit with plans when it\u2019s beneficial for them. And if I do hang out with them, I always feel like the tag along and like I don\u2019t belong. So yeah that situation of having temporary friends has been repetitive through out my high school life and I\u2019m not gonna lie I don\u2019t really like making new friends now because I fear of the same situation happening again, like why am I going to open up if I know it\u2019s not going to last. And so far in college, no one besides my professors have tried talking to me and I TRY talking to others but them seem so uninterested in even talking so it\u2019s like what\u2019s the point of even trying. College is already stressful enough and I have no one to vent to so I\u2019ve come to Reddit. I\u2019m hoping someone can relate to this and share their thoughts, if not what am I doing wrong lmao.

Things just were not working out; we had different goals in life, wanted to move in different directions, and the situation was becoming increasingly toxic to the point where it felt like every night ended in an argument.\n\nThe first couple days were honestly pretty good; I felt very free. I truly did love her, but now I could do whatever I wanted. I could go out and party and theoretically have sex with anyone who said yes. I could flirt with anyone. I didn't feel confined to this toxic relationship that was failing despite how much effort I put in (that was never reciprocated.) I thought of her often, since this was my first serious relationship and I missed talking to her, but other than that feeling I'd say I was genuinely happy. I went out and bought a bunch of clothes for myself, because I wanted to look good. I held my head up high, and had a smile on my face.\n\nAs August began and went on things started to get a bit rougher. Despite being free from the chains that were holding me back, I was lonely now. I never realized how much of an impact being with her had on me; I always had someone to talk to, I had someone to cuddle with, and someone to hold me when I was alone and had nobody else. I spent so much time with her that I didn't even need friends, and distanced myself from everyone that I was close with. August, I didn't have that person. I got hugs and comforting from some of the friends who decided to take me in again, but it wasn't the same. It's never the same, even though I appreciated it.\n\nI started drinking a little bit \\[for clarification, I am under the legal drinking limit, so it makes all this a bit worse\\] and unfortunately decided to try a few other things for my privacy I won't mention here, because it was better than this daunting feeling of loneliness that haunted me and just wouldn't leave me alone. It helped, even though at the time I realized that it was bad and I shouldn't be doing it. I even self harmed a couple times, mostly in late August, because the pain that I'd been going through before my breakup and the loneliness just got too intense.\n\nSeptember passes...October ensues...I've never been more lonely. I, once again, have begun distancing myself from everyone thinking that it was because I just didn't fit into my friend group, yet here I am realizing that it only made me more lonely. My relationship between my closest friends have become destroyed, my self confidence is at an all time low, and despite having that freedom of a single male, I don't use it. Ever. I haven't had sex or any intimacy other than a bit of grinding at my high school's homecoming dance, which only made me feel more lonely after the lights dimmed down and the crowd began to dissolve. Sex was never important to me, but being intimate (i.e cuddling, holding each other close to keep the cold out, kisses, etc.) always was, and very little made me happier than going on adventures with the love of my life hand in hand and seeing the world.\n\nI have all these dreams of being able to travel the world, seeing everything from the endless fields of Montana, to the snowy forests of Alaska, to the bustling cities of London and Moscow and even the rural Ukrainian farms abandoned since the nuclear disaster. The hardest part is that every time I envision my future, full of travels and adventures, I envision a girl next to me seeing it all with me. I can't shake that wish, to be able to roam with someone, and go on the most spontaneous and fun adventures. I want someone who's always willing to have a cup of hot cocoa in the rain and go on long walks in the snow, or watch the stars begin to show after the sun puts on its' pajamas and tuckers into bed, or to lay in a huge empty field as the sun creeps back up over the mountains to the east. Even just staying inside all day, or eventually starting a family- things I never imagined myself doing four years ago- seem so amazing. Just to be with someone. Anyone. Even my ex-girlfriend, who wants nothing to do with me and is happily in another relationship.\n\nI don't know what to do any more, to be honest. I've been sober/off the stimulants and drugs for at least two weeks now and haven't even come close to them. No alcohol since August. I haven't self harmed in at least a month, which is good. Though, every time the loneliness gets real bad, I start to think about how much easier it would feel if I had some kind of physical pain to reduce the mental pain I go through every day. I go to bed lonely, wake up and one of the first thoughts is of how lonely I am. Some nights I go to bed truly believing that I am better off dead, and wake up the same way. In the past, I lost someone to suicide, so I know how much pain it transfers onto others and that it's never the right path to take, but other nights I get so lonely that I seriously consider ending it all. I've texted my ex a couple times, and she responded out of kindness some of them. I just want to talk to her again. I just want to hold her again. I want to be so madly in love that I forget that lonely is a word in the first place. \n\nI'm just so worried that will never happen. Aside from my terrible acne, I'm a moderately good looking person, who has a bit of confidence, and a great personality, decent body, and loves adventuring. Unfortunately, that's not good enough I guess. Or maybe asking for someone who wants to grow with me, who's in it for the long run, is too much to ask for this day in age. Everyone says that eventually I'll find the person, but I just don't know any more. I don't know if there is a right person for me. Or anyone. Maybe some people are destined to die alone.\n\nWith love.", "subreddit": "lonely"}

I do suffer from some trust issues and depression so that may be why. \n\nI'm starting to think what I always thought that I should own my loneliness and just do stuff alone. Of course, being unemployed leaves you with little possibilities cause you don't really have the cash to spend. \n\nI dunno, maybe I should get used to not having friends, or a partner or anything.", "subreddit": "lonely"}

But that doesn't mean you cannot find your own serenity. Here are some real life stories which I have experienced in this last year:\n\n\\- once I asked the lady working at the reception of the company in which I used to work whether she wanted to have lunch together. It wasn't just me, another (female) colleague was to join but she thought I was trying to somehow get her out. She turned down the invite saying she had to get her nails done, a few minutes later I happened to be at the desk of the aforementioned other lady and I noticed that she had just texted her making fun of me for trying to have a lunch. It was not my intention at all, I wasn't even interested in her, but this is what I got;\n\n\\- on another occasion, I had a lunch instead with a nice lady I know who was temporarily seconded to our office. We went to a restaurant I often go, where I know the staff very well. A few days later, one of my best friend told me that the waitress (who, by the way, is a very kind and lovable person) had said somehting like \"he got no chance with that girl\". Please be aware I already knew that (in the meantime, she has found a boyfriend whose profiles on social media radiate confidence);\n\n\\- recently, at a food event in town, I spotted a cute girl I had previously met once. I approached her, called her by her name and she looked at me as if she had seen something hideous... I asked her if she remembered me and her answer was \"no\", I added a few details and she said that she must have forgotten who I am. I didn't continue any further.\n\nThis is just 2019, if I went back in time there would be plenty of similar stories. Please note that my personal situation is not bad at all: I have a job, decent salary, I am quite fit and I like dressing fairly well. However, I have been alone my whole life and, as you can see from the three stories above, I can't even try to change it. Rejection occurs before I can figure out what to do. \n\nTo make it short, I think it's much better to do what you like, to live your life on your own terms without making the effort to please other people. I have my own schedule, my activities and I make no compromises. You don't feel better but at least you stop looking for \"changes\" which are useless.\n\nHave a nice, boring Sunday people.

Anyway she's one of these art ho types that is sensitive and has her own plethora of issues. She's actually quite nice and insightful, anyway I asked her how she was doing and she said not too good. We went on to have a little chat about loneliness that ended up pretty much blowing my mind, giving me an a-ha moment and making me feel as if I had put another puzzle piece in place.\n\nAnyway she said something like everyone is fundamentally lonely. We're brought into the world alone, and we pretty much die alone. Unless we're gonna find a way to merge our consciousness with that of another like some sort of weird spiritual surgery, then we're in this vessel for the foreseeable future. It sucks. I want to just jump into the void and be one with god again, but i guess that's not why I'm here.\n\nI realised that even though human beings are basically doomed to loneliness, this isn't actually all bad. Think about it. You're in this body, you have this soul. That means that this is the only soul you can ever truly know 100%, the person who's thoughts and feelings you know inside out, every disgusting crevice and charming cranny. Sure, you can get to know other souls, but even if you're in a forever relationship with your soul mate, there are still things you don't know about him/her, intricacies that they can't even articulate to you. Some things are lost inevitably, which is why people often get lonely inside of relationships, which was something that blew my mind before but makes more sense and seems more realistic now.\n\nI am the only soul I will ever know fully. And from that lens, if you are lonely, maybe that's a good thing. Maybe it's a signal. A signal that says, hey, you're out of touch with yourself, you feel like a stranger inside of your own soul and body, let's fix this. So you get hit with loneliness, because inside of that solitude is the only way that you can begin to find yourself and reclaim your fragmented soul. And once the pieces start to come together, you begin to feel at home in the world, within yourself, like you really like yourself and like spending time within your vessel, and maybe you don't want to leave anymore. And maybe because of your own newfound connection to self, you can appreciate and connect that much more to beauty, to the world, maybe even to others. \n\nIn that sense loneliness is therefore, a gift. It is packaged disgustingly and looks like this vile and unwanted thing that never wants to leave you, but if you decide to open it, you might be incredibly surprised at what you find inside.", "subreddit": "lonely"}

Something to do with not being as fit as other guys my age.\n\nI feel like I should talk to someone, at least make an effort to try to start being happy. Maybe there's something I'm missing. Something that makes life special. I just don't see it. I'm not sure. So here I am. Making an effort. Any advice on how to cheer up?", "subreddit": "lonely"}

I've never had many friends in middlehigh school and it's never bothered me. I've always known I was lonely but it never bothered me until a few months ago. I was homeschooled for the first time because we moved and I thought I would like it better. The entire school year I had no friends because I never left the house to meet new people anywhere. \n\nThis year is my final year of school and I decided to go back to a public school. So far I like it better because I'm surrounded by kids my age but I still don't have any friends. I don't talk to anyone unless they talk to me first. I've never in my life hung out with someone after school or did anything fun with them. I've never been to a party or even invited to one. \n\nThe only person I talk to is this girl I added on snapchat lives close to me, but I know we can never actually meet. She is the only thing that makes me happy throughout the day. She's my only friend I have and the only person I talk to. It sucks because I am so dependent on her for my happiness. We've gotten closer to eachother over the few months we've been talking to eachother. We both care about eachother but I feel like I am super attached to her. Anyone who gives me any attention at all I immediately become attached to them, and that's exactly what happened with her. I hate myself because I know if she just stopped talking to me all of a sudden I would be a mess. I cry myself to sleep almost every night just at the thought of me having no friends and how I ruined my life and wasted my teenage years. I feel like such a failure to everyone close to me. \n\nThe part I really hate about myself is that I feel like I have to control every situation. I think I've gotten better at it, but I still get the feeling every single time. Whenever she leaves me on delivered and I see her snapscore going up for hours I feel like she just doesn't care for me anymore. I get jealous at every little thing and I hate myself for it. It could be just her going out with her friends or something. I know that it is a super toxic thing to have in a relationship so I try to not let it get to me. I tell her to just have fun, but deep inside I would rather her just stay home and talk to me all day. I try not to show her I am jealous and feel controlling, but sometimes it gets the best of me. I need constant reassurance that she still cares about me and wouldn't leave me for some reason or else I feel not cared for anymore. \n\nYesterday was one of my worst days emotionally. The whole day I felt alone and I felt she didn't want to talk to me. Near the end of the day she told me she just got back from a party and didn't have service there. Of course I got mad for no logical reason at all and I told her I hope she finds someone who she likes and actually wants to talk to, and I removed her from snapchat. I know I fucked up instantly and I regretted it. I had her numnber so I asked her why she doesn't talk to me. She said she was just tired some days and slept or just wanted to watch tv. I told her I needed her in my life (ironic since I removed her on snap). She told me I am always mad at her. I try so hard to not get mad but I just feel like I need to for some reason I hate it. She told me she was worried about me and I should get help, but she's the only one I trust talking to. \n\nI am so lonely, I just don't know what to do and I want it to stop.", "subreddit": "lonely"}

I have a damn good friend that is basically a brother to me. I've got good things, I've no right to be sad and lonely.\n\nYet, I am.\n\nYou know what I'm talking about. You're 'here', but not *really* here, y'know? I've always felt separate. Different from everyone else. Doesn't make me special, just makes me frustrated and lonely. I don't think I'm really from around here, but ayy, that's just my dissociation and depersonalization and other stuff. Felt this for years.\n\nWorst bit is I know I'm clever enough to know that I will probably be lonely for the rest of my life. Never considered myself attractive. Even if I did meet some nice girl or someone or whatever, they'd run soon after really getting to know me. I've got way too many problems. *Seriously, heaps of problems.* Luckily, no substance or alcohol abuse. But I get why people turn to drink and the needle with the kind of issues I got.\n\nThink what might annoy people about me, for those that are lonely, is that their loneliness may not be their choice. It is for me. I choose to be as closed off as possible. I honestly think of myself as a freak and a monster. I know I am a burden, and nothing anyone tells me can shake that feeling. I had dreams, ambitions and goals. Before things, y'know, ***really*** *didn't work out.* I've been doing nothing for years now, due to circumstances beyond my control. My problems can't be fixed with a pill, powder or alcoholic beverage. Even if I manage my problems, they aren't gonna go away. I can't fix me. No one can.\n\nBut maybe, just maybe, I can help other people. That's my new dream now. I want to help my family. I want to give my best friend good things. I want to make people laugh, smile. I could try to be a therapist, but geez, that really isn't a good idea for me. I get too stressed, way too easily and I'll get sick again. I'll try and help people if I can anyways.\n\nRegardless of the loneliness, I'm gonna try and do something. May cure the loneliness, might not. I hope it can go away a bit, so I can help others. I can't stress this enough, I just wanna help but I know I'm a wreck myself. Kinda sucks, mang.\n\nAnyway, if you read this? Thanks. Mean that.

Basically, my life is a joke, my life is a pile of shit, literally.

I try to connect with people but I can't maintain interest over text for very long, I try to call because I'm better at that (less needy but the social anxiety makes it physically hard) but they're always busy or think it's weird.

What is wrong with me?", "author": "passatas13", "self_text": "I don't even know where to begin. Getting intimate with woman seems like something that only happens in movies. Really I often even forget that people actually do that. Girls that used to be around me (classmates, neighbors, friends) never saw me in intimate way when I was younger like 15-18 years old. My male friends would often flirt with these our mutual girl la friends and they would often flirt back, but when I tried to flirt with them (I didn't tried to flirt with them often for obvious reasons) they would always be like \"what the fuck are you trying to do\" and then continues flirting with other guys. My last attempt to flirt with girl was probably when I was 19 years old. \n\nBecause of that I never came to the point where I could ask girl out and so I never did. I never asked a single girl out in my life. I'm 28 btw, but people always miss on my age and they think I'm 18-22 cos I look younger.  None ever guessed my age correctly.\n\nAny way when I was young I was really messy, shity haircut, really shitty face skin, used to have shit loads of pimples. Now these things are improved. And I can tell u get much more attention from girls since I was 21,because when I was 21, it was first time when girl show me obvious sign of interest. Long story short, group of girls were walking down the street, they saw me, started flirting, asked for my number, was texting me for days, wanted to go out with me, but they were only 15-16 at time. I'm not pedo. I refused and we stopped talking. Few fmiliar stories happened since then. Thus boosted my ego. But I still stayed that shy sperg who wouldn't have balls to ask girl out. But still I kinda changed my view to my self and realised maybe I'm not that bad as I thought I was during my teen years.\n\nBut now I get my ego shattered to million pieces again in my job. I work here with some younger guy who is 18 and in my opinion he is average looking, maybe little above also he's like 4 inches shorter than me 5'11\" or something. He started working with us not long ago and amount of attention he gets from women Co workers is crazy. They saw that he's feeling cold, they was like \"if you are getting cold now, what you gonna do at winter\" asked him in flirty way. He just smiled, some younger girl few tables away was like \"I could make him warm\". They would never care if I was getting cold, they would see me getting cold, they would probably me like \"aren't you mand enough to not get cold\" I mean they didn't say that, but from what I see how they flirt with him and how they never flirt with me, it looks like they would rather mock me than flirt with me. Also I heard how one of older asked that younger girl what she thinks of that 18yo old guy, and she was like \"he's perfect\". But 1 year ago I accidently heard how they were talking about me and that younger girl was like \"meh, not really\" but she was trying to flirt with me any way for couple weeks. I mean she's not my type I talked to guy he said she's not his type either. But who cares if she's not my type, they point is she think that average looking guy is way better than me even though he shows her no attention at all. And I have noticed that older Co worker women view to me changed a lot. I can feel many of them are despising me for what iam. They can't accept me that way. Working here has became suicide fuel to me. When I was new to this job too, I probably got familiar amount of interest from women as this guy gets.  But soon they stopped showing that interest in me. Specially that young girl she stopped showing interest after like 1 week, and this guy haven't showed her any positive signs back for like 2 months, but she's still trying to flirt with him. I also see older Co workers often mirim at him, if they notice I noticed them checking him out, they imidiantly look away. \n\nAny way, I'm at the point right now where even if 10/10 girl asked me out I would refuse, I wouldnt know what to tell her or how to accept that, but that would never even happen. The only way to get intimate with a woman for me is if I come home and I find naked woman lying on my bed with legs wide spread begging me to fuck her. I don't seey self any other way getting close to girl. Normal ways are unachievable for me, I don't know what to do, I don't know what to say, I don't know where to begin. I always thought some day miracle will happen and it actually will happen, but the longer it gets I start realising it will never happen. I don't even care any more if I will not have children and family, I have accepted I will always be like this. I'm planing to quit my job as soon as possible, too much suicide fuel there.\n\nP. S.

So I'm 25 and I am completely out of friends. Lost quite a few of them after I finished high school and I started my studies in another town, made some friendships there but they weren't really deep or meaningful. They were just about hanging out together rather than spending our free time alone in our apartments. I had a very good friend for like a year, that was when I was 22. We hang out almost every day, but his \"gang\" was interested in smoking weed all day and I wasn't. There were times that they would decide to leave me alone in the bar that we were for 30 minutes or more just to go somewhere and smoke or do drugs or I dunno, I never found out. So out of nowhere one day I find out that they all went on a trip without me even though they invited me at first. I called him one day and he told me that they were already at some beach and that for some reason the original plan went south. I got mad and decided to not talk to them, and they never really texted or called back. I met him randomly a couple of times, we said \"we should grab a cup of coffee\" but we never did. After that until now my life has been empty. I've had a couple of people in my life but ended up leaving me or perhaps I pushed them away from my life I dunno. Basically now all I have is a friend that any time I wanna go out I have to call him and another one who is like 200km away from me and is now too much of an Instagram diva to have time to talk. All I want is to feel wanted. Someone to text me and ask if I am ok. I ve called people before to go out and they said they have plans. Nobody has ever invited me to those \"plans\", if there ever were any. I would like to think I am a pleasant person when I m surrounded by others. Now all I do is wear my pyjamas after work and spend all my free time in front of my pc. My father told me once, \" you're gonna get married one day and you won't have someone to be your best man\" and it hurts so much because it's true. I don't have anyone to talk about my problems. Can anyone out there help me? I hate that I am being so selfish, knowing that there are actual problems out there like wars, starvation etc. On the other hand, all these years have been a struggle to just find someone to get out of my house for a couple of hours.

Except they told our friend group about their relationship that night. So I kept quiet and hoped my feelings would disappear.\n\nYet those feelings didn't disappear, in fact they became stronger. It got to the point where I felt suffocated sometimes by my feelings for her. I began feeling depressed, anxious and lonelier than ever. I started getting panic attacks when I thought about her, or hanging out with her. \n\nI've been beating myself up a lot over having feelings for her, for feeling envious of her boyfriend, feeling guilty over having these feelings. I've never felt so low.\n\nI didn't tell anyone for a while. I wanted nothing more than to confess my feelings to her, but I was so scared it would alienate her and my other friend. I was terrified that telling her would make me lose all of my friends.\n\nI knew she never had feelings for me like that, I knew she probably wouldn't ever have feelings.

My need for physical affection? A combination of all that? Maybe the answer doesn't matter.\n\nI told her about my feelings two weeks ago and it was the scariest thing I've ever done.

My kids are growing up and in school and have activities.  They simply need me less and the time I spend with them is mostly just getting them ready for school, feeding them, or driving them somewhere.  So my days are spent by myself.  I feel totally defective.  I got a gym membership just to have a place to go.  I've tried doing classes, but I just feel more lonely because I feel like I'm almost intruding by being there.  I live for little interactions like going to the grocery store and having a cashier be a little chatty.  I talk to the other parents at school, but just kind of feel like an alien and can't seem to break into the groups there.  I used to work.  I liked my job but had to quit for my family.

This way they can meet up in real life and coordinate social interactions. You can think of it as similar Meetup but free, more secure, wide demographic, and many other features. It will be free to use, unlike Meetup.\n\nFeatures a live map with events and people, a securely encrypted chat, and a discovery feed to meet new people.\n\nFor instance, let's say you moved to a new city for work, you don't know anyone there, and are looking to meet people and find fun things to do. You fire up the app and connect with people who have interests in common, and events curated to you.\n\nOr, let's say you want to find something to do tonight, you open the app and see what events are happening -- curated to your specific interests. You can also post your own events and have people join you.\n\nThis is perfect for a sub like this, where the whole point is to be more social. The purpose of the app is **to create a great social environment through meaningful real-life interactions**.\n\nHere's a look:\n\npic: [https://i.imgur.com/LCA8THk.png](https://i.imgur.com/LCA8THk.png)\n\nshowcase video: [https://youtu.be/J6iaks2B7ec](https://youtu.be/J6iaks2B7ec)\n\n**follow us on our new sub for updates**: [https://www.reddit.com/r/LocusApp/](https://www.reddit.com/r/LocusApp/)\n\nI just finished the design stage, next is the development phase (app needs to be programmed). Wanted to see if this is something people would be interested in using before I build it.\n\nIf this is a project you're interested in, definitely sign up to the mailing list on the website to stay updated. I'm not here to shill or to ask for money, however any type help would be appreciated; donations, feedback, suggestions, or if you have a skill that might come in handy.\n\n**I'll read the replies, so let me know your thoughts and if this is something that you would use. Thanks!**\n\nFrequently Asked Questions:\n\n*What is this?*  \nLocus is an affinity group platform centered around the idea of building a community through the connection of users that share similar interests/experiences. It allows users to form groups, and create/discover events that they are interested in.\n\n*What makes it better than apps like Meetup?*  \nIn terms of cost, the platform will be **free** to use. Locus will reach a broad audience with free user-event creation and an engaging interface, unlike Meetup.com. We intend to maintain user-friendly privacy practices and promote a policy of not selling user data and be a platform that users can rely on. Messaging uses strong end-to-end encryption, and the company will follow user-friendly privacy protection policy. It does not sell your data as a monetization method.\n\n*What about meeting up with people from online? How do you ensure safety?*  \nGreat question. Based on our research we know that a lot of people might feel anxious or worried about meeting people online. We are implementing Identity Verification to increase the overall safety of users. Several methods will be used, such as: e-mail/phone confirmation, social media connection, integration of identity verification API, and more. This will ensure that users have a verified profile, so that the platform is safe to use. This is something that we are placing a focus on.

I only had hookups/kisses with guys (I am bi, which does help a bit), but never a date or an SO.\n\nI am \"West Indian\", which means my parents are not from India, so my family is pretty Americanized since my family came from the Caribbean. Sadly, I only speak English, but I have no accent (some people find American Hollywood accents attractive).\n\nHave you noticed that when you go out in public that the only people who are constantly making phone calls are people that speak foreign languages? The only English speaking people who are constantly making phone calls are people who are just making work phone calls. The bilingual people are probably speaking to their SO or friends from their culture that is hard for super Americanized people like me to attain.\n\nIt's sad that in America, we have to be born from a non-American origin/nationality in order to have a group of friends or to easily get an SO here in America.\n\nI was with a group of two Indian guys and one Hispanic guy working on a college project yesterday and the two Indian guys speak their own Indian language. They even invited two of their other Indian friends to come help us with the project and they speak the language themselves. They were talking about numerous girls they had sex with, numerous threesome opportunities, and I noticed the names of the girls they mentioned are Indian names.\n\nSo it seems like in order to get an SO or a big group of friends, you must be able to speak a foreign language and have family from a country where it is easy to find a lot of your own kind in America.

My dad got remarried literally 2 months after meeting up with a girl he \u201chad a crush on in high school\u201d, even though he and I were supposed to have some actual fucking bonding after leaving a toxic relationship. He also had a kid not much later (like literally his wife was pregnant when they got married-not that there\u2019s anything wrong with that, but only after TWO MONTHS and without even mentioning it to me, then there\u2019s a fucking problem) and now that mistake is ruining my life. My dad and step mom are so busy with my asshole brother and their work and videos and whatnot that they have no time for me, and are so inconsistent in their moods that I once got yelled at for feeling suicidal, but as soon as I do something actually bad like watching a tv show I never should have, I just get a light scolding. They don\u2019t have the time to deal with me because I guess I\u2019m hard to deal with, and if they actually do deal with me they never take the time or care to do it right. And since I\u2019m still a minor, a lot of shit that I legally cannot do, they have to do, but they fucking don\u2019t! They have tried to send me to places and make me do things that I can\u2019t legally do because I\u2019m not an adult and then get mad at me because I couldn\u2019t do it. Not just that, but they have plenty of money, but they\u2019re not helping me out with college at all and instead they\u2019re spending it all on stupid shit for themselves and my little brother, all stuff they don\u2019t need and probably will never use.

Hell, nobody hangs out with me. Nobody wants to. I know some of it is because of my parents and my little brother, but am I that much of an embarrassment? I know I get over excited and loud and energetic sometimes, but that\u2019s because I can\u2019t act like that at home, because I trust them and because I\u2019m just so happy to be around people. Almost all of my friendships are one sided, and I\u2019m just now realizing this and how fucking far deep I am in this shit hole. I\u2019ve never had a girlfriend because nobody cares about me.

Well.. Unfair. This is gonna be long and cover some points for both sides of the dating game, but if there is going to be a tl;dr: I'm lonely and don't understand why I'm expected to hurt somebody else just to satisfy some sexual itch.\n\nI'm 31, for me the days of \"casual flings\" were never prolific but I'll say it's been 7 years since I last had sex, over 10 years since I had a partner that considered herself my girlfriend as much as I did. Recently I moved back to my hometown (less than 700 population according to last census), and being in a relatively small category of single moderately handsome men older than 25: I actually have been faced with a rather forthcoming waitress at the cafe in our town.\n\nI hope I don't come off as an asshole or a chauvinist, but this lady just isn't my type. She's kinda cute, reeeeeaaallly nice, but I can tell this isn't somebody I'd want to spend a whole lot of time with. I brought this up to one of my (married) out of state friends and he keeps telling me to \"go for it\", despite my objections about knowing that I'd not want to spend the rest of my life with this person. I figure that's fair right? I don't want to risk being in a committed relationship with this lady so I'm not going to start dating her just for sex, because who's to say she's not also lonely and looking for somebody to settle down with.\n\nAm I the dumb one here? I figure at around 25 most people want to have some sort of love life, think about settling in and moving in together. I mean I don't sit there and think \"first girl that goes out with me is gonna be the one\" but I don't think it's fair to date somebody I would have no desire spending my life with, just for some sex. I want to be able to connect with somebody that I could enjoy spending time with and I assumed that there was an unspoken reality that once you get to a certain age you'd better be ready for relationships to be important. And I don't think it's fair that a) women have to put up with that, and b) dudes have to basically act like they don't want it.\n\nI'm very lonely and desire companionship probably more than anything right now, but I am not going to be so desperate as to settle for the first person to give me their number when I know that beyond looks we aren't going to mesh at all. My friend doesn't get that, and I don't know if I'm the actual idiot here but it just seems so heartless to respond positively to somebodies advances whom I'd not want to be with. She's super nice but even in the few interactions we've had there is just nothing going on there for me, I can't see myself having a meaningful conversation with this person. I'm old enough that I consider that other people my age might want something long-term and wasting their time (especially after looking around this and r/depression) seems like it would be harder on them than it would have been before.\n\nOr maybe I'm too picky considering potential personality clashes. I've never been the kind of guy who'd get angry about women deciding my personality was enough of a reason to steer clear: I'm a nerd and inept at relationships so it's only fair to not force yourself to be with somebody you abhor just because you're afraid of being alone. So on the flip side I hope I'm not sabotaging myself by being too considerate of the position that puts women in. But I get berated by people for not being more of a man-slut and dating people based on looks and ease of access and it's really annoying.\n\nI'd rather be in a LDR with somebody I look forward to talking to than a physical one with somebody I can't stand save for the warmth of their body.\n\nJust some food for thought, if anyone actually read this whole thing I am sure there are a some inconsistencies and questions so I'll do my best to answer.", "subreddit": "lonely"}

I just got a job at a drive thru trying to save for just a car again at 37 years old. Women that come thru the drive thru usually have nice cars. They are more stable then me. Therefore I would not have a chance with any of them because they also find me not good looking or sexy. If I was looked at as good looking or sexy they wouldnt care. But they do care with me and will judge me harshly for it. If they do not drive or work well they are waiting for a guy to come save them. And I am useless. I've been told many times my situation is a deal breaker they said and was put down by them when I said that's shallow.\n\nAlthough like my last post I seen two rare cases at my job where these ugly dudes claimed they got women,I have no idea how they been successful. Maybe it's the new area I'm in and I havnt been here that long or get out. The guy told me to lie and dont tell them I dont drive. But that's impossible and the woman would end it for lying to her. So how many guys on here who struggle with women actually have it bad in life like me in life too? Its definitely about looks but also how well you have it.", "subreddit": "ForeverAlone"}

I had a girlfriend and she was my first one, right before school started she broke up with me, blocked me, and gave no reason why. Since then i've isolated myself from everyone, dont have any friends or people i talk to in college and at most i speak a couple sentences everyday. I mostly play videogames, browse reddit. I used to be a very outgoing happy person before the breakup, we loved eachother and did incredible things for each other. Now i spend every day thinking about her and why she hasant even tried sending a text. I barley talk to my friends from high school. They think we are still dating because I havent said anything to them. I dont know what else to do, my therapist here says all i can do is wait till the day she might text me, but I feel hopeless and not talking to anyone makes me extremely lonely, sad, and I have no energy to do anything. I get high now almost everyday as being high makes me feel slightly okay, Ive done acid to try and burn her out of my memory but that just made me miss her even more. I've been depressed and suicidal before when my mom died when I was 11 but now i feel hopeless, my family mentally abuses me because of how I dress and that im emo, primarily my dad as he's never emotionally cared about me, he only wanted me out of the house, the only thing keeping me going now is reddit which im really happy exists and that maybe hopefully one day I might wake up to a text from her telling me why she just blocked me and cut off contact. Even if I should just move on, shes made such a impact on my life in a good way and i had for her too that i cant wipe her from my brain and that just makes me hate myself even more. We shared so many experiences and we shared so much in common, she was basically a copy of me and she loved me for who i was, I just dont know anymore Im sorry if this is a sob story or anything its just my life has been so shit for years that ive had more things like this happen to me but never as bad as this.", "subreddit": "lonely"}

I need help.\n\nTLDR: \n- a lot of things have happened in my life and my self esteem has become almost non existent. Primarily because I felt so ugly. Any advice is appreciated.\n\nWhole Story: \n\n- So, basically as a kid I was always trying to do new things. And I\u2019ve always preferred to do things how I want to and not follow the norm just because everyone else is doing it. I used to play football outside as a kid and at a certain time I found a fun game (League of Legends) and rather than force myself to go outside and have fun with my friends I\u2019d just stay inside. This was where I got distant from my friends and was kinda lonely but I was okay with it because I was young and could easily find pleasure in other things as there was a lot to know. \n\nPeople have always called me ugly starting in middle school and somewhere between sophomore year and junior year of high school. I\u2019m the type of person that would try to shrug it off and to play it cool or something to hide the fact that it always annoyed me when people would go out of their way to call me ugly. Sometimes I would look in the mirror and examine myself to see if they were right. And I\u2019m pretty funny irl so whenever someone would call me ugly or something of that nature I would flip it around and turn it into a joke that would make people laugh, but more times than not, I was at the butt end of the joke. Eventually I got used to it and whenever someone would call me ugly It wouldn\u2019t even phase me because I expected it. \n\nI also am an analytical person so I\u2019m good at problem solving but I tend to overthink things. Whenever something that would seem to be natural, I might\u2019ve spent so much time thinking of different alternatives and better ways to do things or just judging if situations will have a beneficial outcome for me. \n\nI was on the football team and I was really good. I played defensive end despite the fact that I\u2019m 6\u2019 ft and 180 pounds. It made me feel good because I was pretty ripped and it made me slightly more confident in myself. More like a wide receiver than a defensive end (sorry for this random football talk). It felt good performing well because it felt like I had a mask on and even though I might be \u201cugly\u201d no one could tell, and they only could judge me from my football ability. \n\nI also used to post on Vine when it was relevant and I had a fan base in a small community. it gave me some type of validation when I was younger. Like people can actually like the things that I make or the fact that it\u2019s even possible. But the time consuming nature of it took its toll too because rather than do stuff with my friends I\u2019d rather make 6 second videos. It got to the point where it was a burden rather then me showing my creative ability. And it always felt like no one really cared about me and they really just wanted the content I created. \n\nNearing the end of my high school life, I gradually distanced myself from people. I almost never took any chances. My friends were wondering why I wouldn\u2019t talk anymore. In most of my classes I would just think about things rather than socialize and do class work like everyone else. And it was never to the point where I got bad grades because I set a very high standard for myself at a young age when it came to school. Even when someone needed help with a problem they\u2019d sometimes come to me and I\u2019d help them and stuff. But it was never because they wanted to be my friend or whatever, or even know me but solely would want a good grade. The only reason why this was relevant is because people would make it seem as if they were just being friendly but I could always read between the lines as to why they would talk to me. \n\nAlso it\u2019s not as if I had no friends. I just never had a \u201creal\u201d friend and one that I was truly comfortable around. Usually just people that I would associate with. I gradually started getting lonelier and lonelier. I don\u2019t even think I\u2019ve ever even been out with someone just to hang out or whatever. \n\nCurrently in my first year of college everything has gotten worse. Overthinking even more, feeling sadder everyday and the whole 9 yard. \n\nWhat makes everything even worse is that I\u2019ve never really been intimate with a girl. It feels weird saying it as to why I feel even worse but it has really effected me because I felt like to the average girl I\u2019m unattractive and I shouldn\u2019t even try to get to know them. Back in high school, there was this one girl that I would always make laugh. Like crying laughing every day we would have class together. I thought that since  I didn\u2019t have much going for me i definitely needed to be funny. And I naturally was. It was hard to even look at people because I felt like if I did they would judge me or subconsciously Judge me and they would perceive me in a different way or not want to talk to me anymore. But when I kinda opened up, I could kinda tell she was feeling me. But I had no idea because I didn\u2019t even know that was even possible and I never took it further. \n\nI\u2019m also a virgin and you know the societal stigma against virgins so it made matters worse too. But not In a way where I feel pressured to lose my virginity because of others, but because of myself. Because I feel the need to be comfortable, shown that I\u2019m actually accepted, or that I\u2019m not too ugly or bad of a person that a girl can actually like me to the point where we would have sex. I\u2019ve recently realized this and it made me feel weird and stupid for feeling this way, but truly it is because i just want to know if it\u2019s possible that a girl can actually like me.\n\nI usually try to find things to do and master them, so lately I\u2019ve been trying to learn how to produce music. Also I\u2019ve spent so much time on the daily listening to music. Like I\u2019d just pace back and forth for an 1+ just listening to music, half appreciating the musicality of it and half thinking for imaginary scenarios and brainstorming. I\u2019ve recently realized that it was a way for me to cope. \n\nUsually after classes are done. I would just go back home and do the usual, like every other day trying to improve my talents. But the feeling of loneliness keeps gnawing at me. I feel like no one understands me. Like I\u2019m always by myself, doing things by myself, and just everything by myself. I\u2019ve thought about my current friends and realized that most of them really see me as expendable and don\u2019t see me a friend but more like a person they happen to know. \n\nI strongly dislike being a burden on people because I feel like if I just handled it myself like I\u2019ve always done both parties would be okay. But not asking for help has just made things worse for me personally. That\u2019s why I\u2019ve come to this sub Reddit. I really want to stop feeling this way.\n\nSorry if this was a long read, but I really needed to get this off of my chest because I hate living like this.\n\nEdit: God bless anyone that was able to read this whole thing.", "subreddit": "lonely"}

I\u2019m 18 years old, and I\u2019m stranded hours from home at college. I don\u2019t have a car so I can\u2019t travel, best I can do is walk or take shuttles. My college is quite small with less than 500 students (my high school had double that amount). I\u2019m autistic with Tourette syndrome and despite all my efforts to be outgoing, it seems like no one wants to be friendly with me, let alone be in a relationship with me. It\u2019s also worth mentioning that I\u2019m not very good looking.\n\nIn other words, I\u2019m stuck in a small community that doesn\u2019t want to associate with me. I\u2019ve never had a girlfriend, and I almost certainly won\u2019t have one in college.\n\nGrowing up, I was just as isolated. I was bullied in high school to the point of having to transfer (where I still couldn\u2019t make friends but at least I wasn\u2019t bullied). In elementary school, I had a few friends but didn\u2019t talk much, and I was kind of shunned and made fun of for having Tourette syndrome.\n\nWithout any friends or anything to do outside of school, I played a lot of video games, mainly Nintendo - I had an N64 in elementary school, I ended up getting a DS and Wii later on. I loved the Mario franchise.  (This has to do with the story.)\n\nOnce I hit my teenage years I started listening to music. I didn\u2019t like popular music like what was on the radio, I never did and I still don\u2019t. So most of what I listened to was video game music, soundtracks from all my favorite games over the years.\n\nI really liked listening to the songs from games I used to play, they really bring back memories from being at home before college. \n\nOne day I was on a swing on the college campus with headphones on, as I always did at home where I had a swing in my backyard. I was listening to music from Super Mario Galaxy, one of the most popular games in the Mario series from 2007, with a great story and great music. \n\nAnyway, now to the titular part of this sad story. I was listening to the \u201cComet Observatory theme\u201d (the overworld theme), which is a beautiful, elegant waltz. I decided to look at comments just for fun. The FIRST ONE was from a guy who said he had his first dance with his girlfriend to that song. And with that, my heart sank. It took all the wind out of my sails (not that there was much wind to begin with). I couldn\u2019t cry because I was outside with people walking around, and I couldn\u2019t have people thinking \u201cwhat\u2019s wrong with that guy\u201d. \n\nThe thought of something so wholesome and so great but something I\u2019ll never get to experience is just too much for me.

There was a panel there that was called \"Level up your cosplay\" that turned out to be about what competitions are like but that's fine. Not really my thing but it is put on by the fans and I sure don't want to do any public speaking. Big props to them is what I'm trying to say, they are clearly very passionate about what they are doing and the video they showed us was actually pretty cool and funny. Introducing stage theatrics is a genius idea.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo anyway I'm sitting in this panel after arriving before it started and about halfway through I see that the whole row I'm in is empty and the rest of the place is jammed pack. In my experience the cosplay community tends to be a little cliquey but sweet biscuits. I could understand not wanting to sit point blank next to a stranger but usually rows fill like a few seats down then so on. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nReally knocked the wind out of me at the time I remember sitting there and wondering if I could just sneak out of the room and go cry somewhere. To be fair to the two putting on the talk it was full of interesting stuff if being on stage is your thing but personally I'm a hard pass on that one. I skip the parade as well which the event organisers are happy with as they don't want to have someone spew from nerves on the stage I'm picking. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI would go hang out with other people in cosplay from the same franchise but I was in my Luke Skywalker robes which generally means hanging out with the 501st and they are kind of elitist jerks. I just want to shake the whole packing lot of them and yell \"movie accuracy isn't the gold standard of cosplay and fandom, having fun is\". I don't know anyone in the same boat but I can't even go into the Star Wars subs and forums anymore for all the agro constantly being spewed in there. Don't want to have to enjoy Star Wars alone anymore but I guess this is the world we live in.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nJust wondering if anyone else has had a similar experience?

I've just never met any of them. I did have about 3 different Rey's come up to me and get a picture which was awesome and the lightsaber I bought online is a big hit with the kids. When they get to hold it their little eyes just light up (bright green literally but you know what I mean) that is my favourite part of cosplaying.

Now if you really think about it objectively, and decide you are a good person who can make the other party happy, you do yourselves both a dis-service telling them you are KHV. Especially after you are an older man and that red flag becomes a red banner.\n\nFirst of all black and white thinking is terrible, the world is in shades of grey, and so you can do the wrong thing for the right reasons, the right thing for the wrong reasons, and the other combinations as well. In fact they are all subjective. If you think a lie is always bad, then when people ask you how you are while you are depressed. I bet the results of the truth were bad. While the results of the lie were likely neutral to good. If a woman asks you how her clothes look, and you think they make her look like the koolaide man. Well the truth isn't the best here either is it? Even if you tell her that you don't think it's flattering, you didn't tell the whole truth did you?\n\nSecond of all, many of you need to grow up and check your expectations. No relationship is perfect, most of them end poorly, and they are a shit load of work. If you want to go around saying lying always ends badly. Well the previous example showed no it doesn't, in fact the world is filled with example of where a properly placed lie is extremely beneficial to the individual. Just take politics as an example. Lying is pretty much the most important skill a person can learn. If you've ever seen the show boondocks a fine example is the grandfather smacking Huey. \"Boy what did I say about telling white folks the truth.\" Basically the world is filled with lies, perception is everything. If you expect everything anyone, your friends, family, lover, teacher, politician, or employee has told you to be true. Then you need to check that. Cause it's a high grade delusion.\n\nThird we hear people say things like \"if you had to lie, then they didn't like you to begin with.\" This one is frankly the most insulting. I am not the sum of my rejections. I am actions, and motives. If they laugh with me, feel safe with me, and have affection for me, then a small lie in order to get in the door; obviously was a positive for both of us. I'm still me regardless of how many relationships I've had. People aren't perfect and you expecting them to be is bad. They are going to have preconceived notions and prejudices. If you actually find someone who doesn't and is open to dating someone with zero experience and get it, congrats you found a unicorn. But there aren't enough unicorns to go around. Part of the \"lowering your standards\" thing that goes around here often, is that maybe your standard of what others would have to tolerate is unrealistic. I'm not talking about looks here. I'm talking about their own wariness or prejeludices. No one can be perfect, and none of us deserve it anyways. Physical attraction, sure that's a good standard. Enjoyable personality and company. Sure that's a good standard. So emotionally pure that they are willing to give a man who's never been in a relationship by 30 a shot? Why would you test them like that? It's frankly cruel to both of you.\n\nNow we aren't in highschool anymore but I remember being in highschool. How many young men do you think lied about their first time, before their first time? The number is not insignificant because even as teenagers they were mature enough to be realistic about what matters, and that is perception. You don't want to lie? Too bad cause I can gaurentee you, that those of us who never lie. Are the ones that will end up in the less than 1.2% of men who die virgins after the age of 45.", "subreddit": "ForeverAlone"}

I'm like no worries, are you still down to go out? She said unfortunately tonight is no good and suggested we go out another time (didn't give me a date).

FA's constantly say it's about their looks, depression, bad personality, anxiety, boring persona etc. when I guarantee 95% of the 122k subscribers of this sub aren't. I know people who have those traits yet never have had trouble with romance and bet you know a lot of people who are the same. I even know people who are very attractive in typical societal standards yet they have had less relationships/FWB's etc. It's not just Chads and Stacey's. You don't have to have an amazing personality.\n\nIt is annoying when the people who say 'work on yourself' are those who never had to do such a thing anyway and still get ahead with romance. I think it is the case of being perceived 'normal' is what increases your chances. Self-improvement is not what the average person engages in. If you are 'normal', as in you follow social norms, trends, don't have esoteric interests, act like your peers, reach social milestones etc., then you have an increased chance of being in a relationship because nobody wants to date the 'wierdo'. Most 'average' people that I know have never heard of self-improvement, yet they do well in ALL corners of life from career to love.\n\nThis is what gets me so much. I have more hobbies, interests and willingness/open-mind to try new things than most people I know who are 'sexed up'.

Mere probability; luck of the draw; right time and place; sheer randomness.

Put it this way: having been employed two jobs over 8 years, started new hobbies, been to college and two different universities, I haven't made a female friend since I was 16. I am now 24.

Our interests included art of various forms. making music, making short shitty videos. In 2014 of August 2 of my friends lets call them Noah and Tom came upon my journal stored in a usb flash drive and leaked it to pretty much anyone who wanted to see it. Their initial reaction was to call my father and tell him what I has written, they misconstrued entries that I was \"planning to kill my best friend\" who we will call James. Noah, Tom and James picked me up at my house as if were just hanging out smoking weed. As it became apparent that they read my journal I attempted to show that I wasn't exactly what I wrote in my journal. Backing up a little I had gone through a mental break down via drug overdose on cough medicine. The breakdown changed my thinking process so drastically for a period of time it seemed as if I could do anything if I wanted to for the better. After the blow of people losing trust in me and sensationalizing my writing I got back into drug addiction after being 3 months sober cold turkey. Every time I tried to make new friends there was definitely the former circle discouraging people to befriend me or at the very least trust me. The thoughts in my journal fucked my best friends mind up so bad he quit his job at the time, he told me he cried reading my journal. I wish I could say sorry and I wish he would accept it. Noah and Tom popped back in my life as I finally got a new job as a janitor. They said sorry for reading it but they \"couldn't put it down\" which I suppose is flattering but they seemed to only pop into my life so we could buy DVDs(our slang for coke) I tried to talk to Noah one day he stopped talking to me again and there was only Tom left. Tom and I were good friends we helped and hurt each other plenty of times. He seemed to be over the whole thing but Tom and I despite being good friends only seemed to drink together. I missed the creative side of the circle James injected, Tom was more of the partier. I'd make videos for him to remind him of the old days and having a creative drive but he never really seemed motivated to help me most of the time although he had good intentions for the most part I knew we would just continue drinking together. Making friends as an adult is hard and all my friends are attached to James more than me so I was cast out. \n\nTLDR: Friends read my journal and abandoned me with no clousure.", "subreddit": "lonely"}

{"post_id": "dp61s2", "created_utc": 1572438546, "title": "What gets people to like others, but not me?", "author": "MagnesiumH", "self_text": "I've been thinking about this for a few days and here are some of my reflections. I am FA to the bone, never been in any relationship and I can't even make male friends either, I've been bullied and ostracised at every stage of my education so far. The best-case scenario for an attempt at making friends would be me approaching them, we start talking, alright, I think we're doing good, but then they seem to lose all interest and never go out of their way to talk to me or meet me again.\n\nThe most common answer is that personality and confidence is what matters to people. Let's be real here, the fact that this needs to be said means it is not true. Confidence obviously increases your chances of meeting people and, consequently finding someone you like. But once you've already met someone, I don't think it makes any difference. I don't care how confident the other person is as long as we are talking. If anything, confidence may make me not like you, because I am more likely to find you obnoxious. \"Confidence is sexy\" my ass. For hundreds of thousands of years it was your genes that were sexy, but only three decades or so ago it became confidence?\n\nMaybe I am not confident ENOUGH? Then how confident is confident enough? Statistically speaking, the vast majority of people have or will have a romantic partner and/or same-sex friends. If there was an objective and quantifiable metric by which you could determine someone's confidence, it would tend to a Gaussian distribution. So there's plenty of people with low confidence who have success with meeting people. Not to mention, confidence comes from positive responses to your actions from other people. That alone means it can not be the cause for people liking you, because it is the RESULT of people liking you.\n\nPersonality? Interests? Yeah, if we like similar things, we are more likely to like each other, if only for the fact that we have something to talk about. But I think it's bullshit that even if the other person doesn't share your interest they can find it cool to talk about it. In my experience, women don't care about your passions unless: they share them, they make you money, or they make you look better (excercise.) I've heard girls say they like dudes who excercise not because it makes them look better, but because it shows their dedication. If that was the case, why do they not find it attractive to play hardcore tabletop RPGs or do speedrunning of video games? Similar level of dedication, just one makes you look better.\n\n*Self-improvement?* What does that even mean? People always say: Maybe you should focus on improving yourself before looking for a relationship and in the same breath they say it's something you do for yourself, not to find others. Again, self-improvement can mean many different things and depending on what it means for you, it will likely not improve your chances of meeting people, unless it is excercise (which improves your looks.) To me, self-improving would mean studying more and wasting less time on the internet. Not something that will get chicks to flock over me. Not to mention, the vast majority of people do not spend time self-improving, they just exist. I wonder if the people who give out this advice have themselves applied it, or if they just stumbled upon a relationship. I think this alone is enough to discredit what they say.\n\nCould it be all about looks? Maybe, but I can also promise you that they will not guarantee you anything. I have been told by multiple non-relatives that I am handsome and I myself think I look about average, yet I've had incel-level success with meeting people, maybe even worse since some incels have real-life male friends. I can't really say much more about the topic.\n\nLast week, I was feeling different. I think, for the first time ever, I've felt like a normal person. I can't tell you why that was, I just did. I felt like I could do anything, meet anyone. I spoke to a lot of people that week and wasn't bothered when it didn't work out. I didn't take any substances, I really don't know what happened to me. I had the confidence, the positivity, I had interests and personality, I had the optimism and (allegedly) the looks, how could I POSSIBLY NOT get someone to like me? The reason this high only lasted a week is because I realised everything was playing out the exact same way as always.\n\nWith every passing year, I am more and more leaning towards thinking it's just a fucking curse, because how else can you explain all this bullshit?", "subreddit": "ForeverAlone"}

The scenario changes, the cast is always me and the only girl I\u2019ve ever asked out. Sometimes I relive the only date we had, sometimes with a \u201cbetter\u201d ending, sometimes not. Only once did I dream of having sex with her, and it wasn\u2019t exactly consensual. Boy did that one sting.\n\nMost of them, though, are about me seeing her again and apologizing. In the real world, before I asked her out, we were best friends. I have had \u201cmood problems\u201d since third grade. I was bullied a lot for being fat and I\u2019m very timid, so I never fought back, verbally or otherwise. So I dealt with it by crying. It seemed like any school staff were wracking their brains to figure out how to deal with me, nevermind the bullies, so I guess I\u2019m the problem. Anyway, mood problems turned into depression. In and out of therapy and medicated, my depression was at its worst during freshman year in high school. \n\nOne day She says that she likes my shirt. I was wearing a Monty Python killer rabbit shirt that my dad got me, so thanks dad, and that got us talking. She was really into Pirates of the Caribbean and Lord of the Rings, like, she could write elvish and had the longest blond hair. I\u2019m more of a Star Trek type, but we nerded out a lot throughout the year. \n\nI was getting a handle on my Depression and gaining some confidence, so I asked her out. We went on a date and at the end she said she didn\u2019t want to change our relationship. Hindsight is 20/20, I was a nervous wreck on that date and not charming at all, but at the time I had less empathy. I didn\u2019t blow up or cry, I just wrapped things up, did a few more friendly activities and that was that.\n\nThat was really that. I didn\u2019t let her know that I was molten inside. I simply started pushing her away. Because I was hurt. Because I didn\u2019t know how to handle this precision rejection. I talked to her less and less throughout high school and then we went our separate ways (worlds apart)\n\nI feel pathetic still dreaming about her. I think my brain is using her as a default romance partner, the best screen to project my loneliness on to. After that dream, I went on Facebook for the first time in years, still friends. She\u2019s married and has short hair now. \n\nI sure like girls with short hair, but she looks nothing like she does in my dreams. I\u2019m not dreaming about her anymore.

One is technically a former coworker but it doesn't matter to this story. They come in, see me first, then see my chad coworker. They walk past me without even acknowledging I exist and walk up to him then start flirty talking to him. They aren't friends and he was not comfortable with their flirting due to him already having a girlfriend and him not finding either of them attractive. He finally said to them, I have to get back to work and he walked away.

I really want to find someone else, but at the same time. Even though I don't love my girlfriend, I still do care about her feelings and her as a person. I would like to keep a friendship with her if anything....but I don't see the point in staying together if I'm still lonely, and feel like I'm constantly searching for the right person.

So here are some tips.\n\n1. Be absolutely obnoxious and irritating. The more shitty you are the more people gravitate towards you for some reason\n\n2. Spend lots of time with people you like, but not too often or else they\u2019ll get annoyed. If that happens then give them space, but not too much space or else they\u2019ll forget about you.\n\n3. Get blackout drunk every weekend. If you aren\u2019t vomiting in an Arby\u2019s parking lot at 3am you\u2019re not worth anyone\u2019s time.\n\n4. Be happy, but not too happy or else they\u2019ll think you\u2019re fake. If you aren\u2019t happy enough then you are too depressing to be around.\n\n5. Be funny, but not too funny or else they\u2019ll think you\u2019re compensating for depression. If you\u2019re not funny enough then you\u2019re considered too serious.\n\n6. Talk, but don\u2019t talk too much or else they\u2019ll get annoyed. Talk too little and they\u2019ll forget about you.\n\n7. Dress nice, but not too nice or else they\u2019ll feel inadequate. Don\u2019t dress nice enough and they\u2019ll ditch you because you\u2019re a slob.\n\n8. Be absolutely 100% perfect in appearance, behavior, and intelligence. If not you\u2019re too big of a loser for anyone to hang out with.\n\n9. Never ever be yourself. Be a replica of a person you\u2019re trying to befriend, but not too similar because you\u2019ll creep them out. In a friend group? Be an amalgamation of every personality in that group. Soon enough you\u2019ll forget who you are and people love that because they\u2019re all leeches that feed off of insecurity.\n\nHope this helps uwu", "subreddit": "lonely"}

The thing is, they aren't available to someone like me. When you know you aren't specially ugly. When you know you have a couple of disorders. When you know you have tried everything to fix yourself. When, no matter what you do, your circumstances don't change (and they even get worse). That's when you know there's something wrong with yourself that you simply can't correct. \n\nI can enter any room and make people laugh. Like I said, I'm not specially ugly, and I see guys much, much uglier than me with friends and girlfriends. I'm quite extroverted and I know how to hold a conversation despite having AVPD, anxiety and past trauma, because I taught myself to do it. I have good hygiene and a decent enough sense of style. I have proven  that \"confidence\" is nothing but a meme. I have hobbies and interests, although they are quite unconventional. For the past 3 years I have self improved to a ridiculous extent, but nothing ever changes. I never had many friends and recently I was ghosted by the only people I knew. I was rejected by every girl I liked, and was never liked by anyone for that matter. I don't know what's wrong with me. \n\nThese are probably my last two months. I refuse to spend another year completely alone, lying on my bed, thinking about what I could be doing with another set of circumstances. No medication or therapy will fix whatever the hell is wrong with me. I don't know who will be reading this, but I just needed to vent.", "subreddit": "ForeverAlone"}

She has been divorced almost a year. Funny thing is that she has been dating since she was divorced but I didn't feel the need to bring that up.  At 39 I just let these sort of things some women say go in one ear and out the other.  I remember when I was in my early 20's a lady told me that if it wasn't for the fact that she had just gotten out of a long relationship she would totally be into me (had a boyfriend a week and a half later).  I have a very low \"dating IQ\" so it took me a while to understand the lesson of \"if she ain't saying yes, consider it a no\"  I remember I had a light bulb moment in my late 20's when I realized that it was pretty odd that every woman I tried to talk to was always too busy for a relationship, wasn't looking to date, or wanted to \"focus on herself\" while all my male friends and cousins seemed to meet women who weren't too busy to date and it was then I finally had to accept that I am just not that attractive to a lot of women.  Now at age 39 I feel that there has to be someone out there.  As much as I hate the \"soft rejection\" or the qualifiers (if it wasn't for ..... I'd date you) I understand that some guys are jerks and don't handle rejection well so I can understand why a woman would say those things.  Still sucks, but I've learned to just keep my mouth shut and move on.  I would say to any younger FAs reading this that if a woman tells you that the timing isn't right or something along those lines, don't waste your time.

I thought he was FA but apparently he has a girlfriend now. This guy literally just sits around and smokes weed all day. He doesn't even have good social skills. He dresses like a homeless dude. He looks like he's never been to a gym in his life. He has no job or any successes in life. His room is a complete fucking mess and his only hobbies are to drink and smoke weed yet he has an SO.\n\nTbh this should be some sort of motivation to me. To see someone like him get a gf. Part of me says I should be happy for him but it shows how shitty and unfair reality is.\n\n I'm always trying to constantly improve myself.

So many good people out there who deserve to be loved and they get nothing. \n\nI won't stop improving myself but ik it wont get me an SO. It may increase my chances but it could still not happen.

Where to begin...born with a stroke I had a quiet childhood.  There were children/teenagers who made fun of me and  I never could make friends.  I always felt out of place with others, while they could dance, swim, skateboard..etc I could not do any of those things.  Really I thought I was or would be a 5th wheel so I just stayed out of the way.  Looking back I see that it is just an excuse because being around people made me nerves and trying things out scared me.\n\n(14-18)High school felt empty to me.  While for the most part I was not made fun of, I also still did not make any friends.  Yes, I really was that guy that sat at the table in the corner all by himself.  I did ok in school C-B avg. and even went to a Homecoming because I girl asked me to it.  However, because I had very little interaction with others that I felt like I gave her a bad time and passed at going to Prom with her.  Funny (not really) thing is I did marry her years down the road.\n\n(27-31)The marriage did not turn out so great.  I should have been more engaged in it (Guessing lack of a social up bring hurt the marriage) and so she found lovers elsewhere.  I did catch her cheating and I did get a divorce....\n\n(34-Present)I did work before and during the marriage but as I have gotten older the affects from the stroke at birth was catching up and I had to stop working.  I live with my parents (disability income does not pay enough for me to live on my own) and we had lived in one state but moved across the country (United States) into another state.  We live in a community for 55+ (I can live with them because of my disability) but being so young here, there is no one of my age to talk to or hang out with.\n\nDuring the day I am normally fine.  I go to the gym and have lost 50+ pounds (from 229 down to 175ish) and I play so video games.  However at night time I start to lose it.  It becomes so much quieter and my mind start to wander.  Questions start to appear in my mind and I do not know how to answer them.  I start to cry silently so I do not wake anyone up because all anyone says is \"You need to fix it.\"  If I know how to fix it I would not be in this position.\n\nI am getting older and as I get older I get more and more scared.  I dont want to be alone.  I want the pain I feel to go away.

I guess you could say that my entire being is average.\n\nBut that's not why I'm here, not that necessarily. I apologize for the lengthy intro. \n\nMy last, fully committed relationship was back in 2016, a long distance one at that. At the time I was happy, I had dreams, I was healthy, needless to say I was going places. However, one thing lead to another and I feel into a pit of anxiety and depression, all the while my Gf at the time was there for me. \n\nGoing onto my Senior year of highschool, I was having trouble studying, or even trying to keep the facade of 'I'm always happy no matter what.' But while I was tha way around everyone close to me, those not within distance slowly crumbled away. One evening, I broke up with my Gf of 2 years. I was cowardly and did it through a text on KiK, muted her, then deleted the app. Even to this day I never saw what final words she sent to me, but for some odd reason, a small fraction of me keeps on telling me that I did the right thing. \n\nWhich brings me to now. 3 years later, and I believe myself to have fully recovered. Hopdfully going to start my dream job of sailing the world by early next year. I survived almost dying due to various health issues, and here I am, healthier than ever, and possibly the happiest person around me, but there lies one issue, how do I fill that hole that has been empty for almost 3 years. \n\nI'm happy, not lonely by society's terms, but even though I have friends and family, the thing i miss the most and makes me completely isolated, is the feeling that I have someone who loves me for the kind of terrible person that I keep on the inside.\n\nIn the end, I don't know what to do. Do I Look for a romantic partner? which I could care less for bodily things, I'm living my life, not looking for carnal pleasures. Do I keep on going the way I currently am? I might have a yellow brick road that I laid out myself, but why does it feel that I'm more lost than ever?\n\nAny help would be appreciated Reddit users. \n-Seth", "subreddit": "lonely"}

More than this, I dont know why it makes me feel so bad. We have no relationship, we just talk. I have no reason to assume she wouldnt be talking to other guys, but for some reason it makes me feel so bad. Im trying to tell myself that its not actually bad. Were adults and not in a relationship and not even really close to one tbh and for all i know she doesnt like that person she slept with but... idk it hurts. i still think i like her too. also i saw that she was still active on tinder which makes sense but idk i guess it confirms to me that she is talking to other people.\n\ntl;dr: girl i have feelings for but have not met fucked some other guy and now im sad\n\nanyway please tell me to stop being a little bitch and getting my feelings upset over this because its so stupid. this is kinda my first experience of \"heartbreak\" too albeit probably minor compared to everybody else", "subreddit": "lonely"}

I was there bcs I wanted to appear on one of his videos, even if it's just my name on the chat.\nThere, I found a player who was being lynched for something I don't remember. I didn't know how to help them, but I thought maybe I can become their friend. So I searched their username on skype and for my luck, I found it. It was actually a 9 yo girl.\nWe became friends since them. I made a minecraft server that we used to play everyday. We build houses, bars, farms etc. Some other people joined us, but they left after some time. It was like that till mid 2013, when we stopped talking to each other. Not that we fight, but bcs of school.\nIn August 2016 I managed to gather her and another friend to play for at least one day together. Like a long time friends meeting. I was 15 and she was 13. The other friend(also 15yo) was a little different: more grumpy and retarded, so it wasn't all that great, but it was cool anyways. After this day, we stopped talking again.\nTill ~20 jan of thus year (2019). She reached to me on Facebook with \"do you still remember me?\" and I answered \"How could I. I tell our stories to every new friend I make.\" and till today(31/10/2019) we still talk everyday. Now I'm 18 and she is 16. We played Minecraft sometimes for the nostalgia on our Aternos server. We made a very cool medirval village, a coliseum and other stuff.\nI forgot to make it clear: it was a web friendship.\nWe never met each other irl... till early this month (5/10/2019).\nI am living in Portugal now, and she was on vacation in Europe, so we agreed to meet each other in Porto. And we did it.\nIt was f*cking amazing. Better than when I met my ex girlfriend. We hanged out with her parents in the city, I could sleep with them in their hotel room so I could be gone (to the city I live, close to college) by the next day, and we even made friendship bracelets! Adorable.\nSince then, I think I like her. I'm almost sure I do. But I don't want to tell her because of her history of \"friend that liked her and their friendship got messy\", so I kept it to myself.\nYesterday I wake up and the first thing she messages me is \"I'm dating a friend\". That's when my world fell. I know I wasn't going ask her to date me or anything, but I have the right to feel sad, right? I just couldn't answer nothing but \"congrats\" and wish her the best of everything.\nYou see, for now on I don't think I'll find anyone I really like as I like her. I'm on a different country from where I'm from, so I don't really feel like that here.\nEveryday it passes, the idea of the future me being an alone gamedev with my house full of cats just gets bigger.\nI have to move on, but it's hard.

Scroll past it if you don't have time and/or desire to go through all of it.   \n\n\nSo the topic will be my loneliness (duh) and how I don't know what to do with it anymore. I will tell a short story of my life, just because I can't keep it in any longer, and Reddit is the last place I have. So here goes nothing.  \nI was a bad friend. A very bad friend. I didn't listen to those who were around me, always put certain people above those who needed me the most. One of my friends once left for 3 months to another country and I didn't write to her once. For years I had this group of friends I was happy with. But then it all changed. One of them (the one I knew for the longest time) left to go to collage about 300 km from the rest of us (he is 2 years older). Only then I realized how different we were, and only one topic kept us tied. Then his brother (3 years younger then me) also left, though here I understand- the difference in mindsets was too big for our relationship to work out. I lost one of my friends to drugs (no, he didn't die, he just started using them and it was so far from the guys me and the rest were, we just couldn't keep in touch) and for this I blame my self even after 6 years. He called me after one of his \"adventures\" and I promised to help, but nothing came out of it. Then the one I was closest with, someone I considered a true brother, with whom I had so much in common, decided to cease speaking to me (we were in the same school, so our contact did not completely cease to exist). And for over a year I did not know why. Only after I learned how bad of a friend I was to him I understood his decision. And that is when my depression really started.   \nNow we come to the last person to be truly close to me, the friend that I mentioned earlier, the one who left for months and I did not contact her. At the prom she kissed me and we started dating. It was a strange situation for me, because the prom happened about 4 months before the exams, and I was terrified of the possibility that one of us could end up on the other side of the country. But I thought \"I don't care, I want to live know, not in the future\". But my worst nightmare came after the results and she had to move over 600 km to study. And when the holidays ended it also was a horrific experience. She needed me, she always was a people's person, she always had a lot of energy and there she had no one. No friends, no me, no parents, not even her cats. And the thing she was studying was rough (medicine). But I was so focused on my own studies that I did not see how much she needed me (I'm studying law). But she ended her adventure there after the first semester and came back home. She was to study to retake her finals and study in our home city. She failed. I did not blame her. So she decided to study about 60 km from me. A huge improvement, right?   \nIn the meantime I also changed my studies to languages. New people, new potential friends. At this point I had suicidal thoughts, I still do, and my depression became the only stable thing in my life.   \nSo we both started from scratch. And she met a guy. (From this point on I'm heartbroken, so buckle up). You know the story- \"He's just a friend.\" Yeah, well, after two weeks he walked her to her apartment, she invited him in, they watched movies and danced until 5 am. After that they went to sleep (separately as I was told) and in the morning she cooked him breakfast and he took a shower. He was so grateful, he thanked her and told her how \"no one ever did that for him, no girl. He did have girls for the night, but none of them stayed for breakfest\". And she believed him.   \nI realize how not about being lonely this is getting so tl:dr- she broke up with me to be with him when I decide to leave my studies to have more time for us and my life in general. She is still with him. And she can't understand why we can't be friends anymore. As the quote says \"First they rip your guts out, and then they want to be friends.\" (- Starship Troopers)  \nWhe loneliness? I have no one. Not a single soul to call, or text, or come over to. Everything I feel, joy, anger, sadness, every-bloody-thing I keep to myself. I did something good- great, I can tap myself on the shoulder. I did something wrong- I can tell that to myself. I miss hugs, and kisses, and someone hand on my head whispering that everything is going to be okay? I can to that myself. I made so many damned mistakes, I don't know how to cope with them. I did talk to the professionals. I did talk to my parents. I did try to stay friends with her. But I feel so frustrated when I see people around me, who were close to me, who cared about me, now not giving a shit because I did something, or didn't do, or said or didn't say something in the past happy with a pack of people when I can't even look into the mirror because I'm ashamed.   \nI don't know how to cope with being lonely. Though, to be honest, I don't even know what I want from this post. I really need to find someone to talk to.  \n\n\nTl;dr- I lost my friends because of my mistakes and my girlfriend left me for \"the guy, I was not supposed not to worry about\" and she was the only one I thought I needed in my life.", "subreddit": "lonely"}

{"post_id": "dpv52j", "created_utc": 1572560918, "title": "\"Those guys aren't jerks they're just 'confident'\"", "author": "ODB95", "self_text": "Ok so before anyone calls me a \"niceguyTM\" or some shit like that lemme just be clear. No I don't believe that every stud or athlete or whatever that is successful with women is a jerk or an asshole.\n\nHowever I just find it funny how quick people are to descredit you by saying you don't know what you're talking about when you call a particular person or group assholes. Confidence is one thing but cocky overconfidence is another which is what so many people get confused despite there being an obvious difference.\n\nIt's not just in the romantic world that this applies either so many people are so quick to defend cocky bastards in general just because \"oh they believe in themselves\" lmao. I know so many truly confident people that don't treat other people like shit and don't feel like they're above everyone else and I fucks with those people. It's the arrogant pieces of shit that feel like they're above everyone else that I have a problem with, but who cares? They're confident who am I to label them as dicks?  How dare I. News flash this is not \"confidence\" this is lack of confidence masked as it, there are plenty of truly confident people that don't act like this. Lmao it's funny how people have this supposed sixth sense to guys that fake niceness to get in girls pants but not sense when a guy is faking confidence.....interesting.\n\nThis world is so toxic that the large majority of people actually go out of their way to defend them. Those same people will shit on someone just because they have low self esteem but will deepthroat (sometimes literally) these pricks and will be the first in line to their defense when they get labeled a name they probably deserve in the first place. Having low self esteem in a society like this is straight hell because not only do people not give a damn about you because (to them) you don't give a damn about yourself so your chances of finding a romantic partner are next to fucked and if you dare complain people will not hesitate to dog on you and say \"well if you don't love yourself how can anyone else? Suck it up and stfu\". Except we can't stfu because we're human and when we're frustrated we tend to express it which in most cases these days is online. Don't \"confident people\" express what's on their mind and hearts not afraid to say what they think? Yet a large group of people here that do express it get labeled as sexists or god forbid incels and they don't even have to disrespect women in their posts. They just need to be loners complaining being lonely and to many people there you go, you got a nice hot steaming incel on your hands.\n\nDon't get me wrong there is at least some truth to that quote I mentioned about loving yourself because you don't wanna go into a relationship with that sad state of mind but I feel like there's a way you can convey that to someone without being a condescending shitbag basically telling someone \"lol you deserve to be alone because you hate yourself \ud83d\ude06\". Kinda counterproductive to tell to someone that already has self esteem issues don't you think?\n\nAnyways back to the original point. I find it both hypocritical and ironic that the same group of people that hate stereotypes towards atheletes or dare I say \"cHaDs\" are the same group of people that have no issue stereotyping people on this sub as being fat neckbearded slobs that just sit behind their computer and whack off to Lisa Ann or anime. The double standards in this one are real.\n\nAnyways there's my piece on this subject take it how you want and let me know your thoughts on this oh so controversial topic.", "subreddit": "ForeverAlone"}

I\u2019ve never had a girlfriend or experienced any kind of intimacy. I\u2019m extremely insecure due to this. I have no social skills but at least I have a good job but no college cause I can\u2019t afford it. I have no opportunity to socialize and meet people because of this.\n\nI feel so broken and undesirable and I know it\u2019s because of how I view myself and my lack of experience but I\u2019ve always viewed myself in a negative way and it\u2019s all I know it\u2019s a downward spiral that never stops. I was bullied in school and mostly ignored and I have anxiety issues. I\u2019ve had suicidal thoughts constantly throughout my late teens up to now. What\u2019s the point in living when you\u2019re chronically lonely and stuck?\n\nI\u2019ve recently considered going to a prostitute because that\u2019s the only way I can see myself experiencing intimacy and I can at least have the illusion of being desirable if only for an hour. \n\nI\u2019ve also been thinking about finding a plug to get Xanax to help with my anxiety I don\u2019t care if I get addicted I\u2019m desperate to escape this feeling by any means. I already drink on bad days and everyday I\u2019m pretty much high cause weed and alcohol helps me escape (it\u2019s hard to wallow in self pity when you\u2019re so fucked up you can\u2019t think)\n\nI\u2019m at a point where I can\u2019t take it anymore there\u2019s so much self hate and I don\u2019t know how to stop it. I\u2019ve tried Therepy. I\u2019m tired of realizing I\u2019m laying in bed alone and that this will most likely be the case for rest of my life especially as I get older and still lack experience in intimacy and connections with other people...I then proceed to cry myself to sleep some nights I feel so much pain inside.", "subreddit": "lonely"}
