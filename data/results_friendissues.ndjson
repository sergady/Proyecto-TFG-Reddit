Not sure how to move forward", "author": "cbhawks50", "self_text": "Hi y'all, I think I'm (22F) getting ghosted by my best friend (21F). \n\nI just moved to another major city, about 2 hours away from where I grew up, went to college, etc. Not having the greatest time per say, and part of that is because I really miss my friends and family, and I don't have a car to go back and forth easily. I've especially been missing my best friend, who is a year younger than I am,and finishing college. We've been friends for about 8 years now, and our friendship has always been kind of effortless, we'd snap each other, text each other, tag each other in facebook memes- she hasn't responded to anything I've sent her in the past week. I sent her this nice, cute good luck message on Sunday. Nothing. I sent her our daily snap to keep up our streak. Nothing back. I sent her snaps again Tuesday and Wednesday. But nothing back from her. Sent a meme Thursday night, and I haven't heard back. So I just stopped.\n\nShe did start classes on Monday, which makes things hell of a lot busier, I get that. But she's out there posting on her snap story, and she's out there watching my story. Like couldn't she at least shoot me a message like \"hey I'm sorry it's been busy\"? Couldn't she have sent me a quick snap? I've explicitly told her what a shit time I'm having with the move, and part of that was because I miss her. I don't expect her to coddle me or be my emotional support animal, but her presence, if not a little support would be nice. \n\nI think this is making me second-guess a lot of the friendship because I've been pretty tolerant of how selfish she's been in the past year. I will admit, I do feel bad because I've had patches of time when I was pretty flaky during our friendship (my dad was in the hospital for a year, another close friend of mine took her life, so very emotionally nitty gritty shit), but I've really worked on fixing this in the past two years. In the past year, I've really sacrificed a lot for her. Whenever she wants I make time for her (and follow through), we always hang out by her apartment, I'm cool with her boyfriend hanging out with us,  etc. But she never does the same thing for me; its always \"Oh I'm busy that night!\", or \"Oh I don't really want to come out by you\". She's been pretty invalidating of the fact that I've been having a shit time moving because \"I'm so close\", hasn't even attempted to arrange anything to come out to visit me. On my graduation day, I wanted to get a meal with her, but she said she was \"tight on cash\" and then later posted snaps of her partying with another mutual friend of ours. Like the fuck? You couldn't have invited me or been straight up? This was shortly after I was the only person to show up to a free happy hour that she won... I've just kind of had it with the bullshit and insensitivity.\n\nI think part of it has to do with the fact that she's moved in with her boyfriend in the past year and she's extremely emotionally dependent on him and she feels no need to nourish other friendships, but yeah.\n\nSo for now. I'm leaving things. She can reach out when she's ready, but I deserve better than waiting on edge for a reply, worrying about a friendship that doesn't even pay me back.\n\nWhat do you guys think? Am I overreacting? Should I give in and contact her at some point?\n\nTLDR; my best friend hasn't responded to me in the past week, she's been pretty selfish in the past year, what do I do?", "subreddit": "FriendshipAdvice"}

She has been a nice change in pace for our group being a girl so we accepted her as one of the boys. She is especially close to my best friend (C). Like a little to close, she has a bf in the marines and they act a little to close for comfort. All 4 of us get along well until the night this story is about.\n\nSo all 4 of us are in band at our highschool, and usually during football season we have no fridays to ourselves due to football games, but this year one of the schools in our conference absorbed another highschool and moved out of our conference which led to us having 1 week during the season with no game. \n\nSo about 3 weeks before the game I text (C) on insta and ask if he would like to go to a different football game that week so we could hang out and watch football without the pressure of a halftime performance and relax for once. When I asked him i asked for a boys night, excluding (R) and including a few guys that we dont hang out with often. He agreed. So we text (E) (the other guy in our group) and he is on board. Somehow (R) hears about this and guilt trips her way into our night. Which honestly is fine with me, I enjoy her company, but originally I wouldve liked to mingle with other females while at the game and not seem disrespectful for not talking to her.\n\nSo fast forward to the night of the game. (E) is no longer going due to his grandfather being in town. And it's just me, (C) and (R). We watch the game until halftime and watch the bands and I say if the game is not close after the 3rd quarter we should leave to avoid traffic, and to extend our night to a different location. Then another girl from our school asked to be taken to her car which is all the way across the county. So being polite we leave about 3 minutes into the 3rd quarter. \n\nWe get to my friends car and all hell breaks loose. These girls were blasting music, slapping my friends hand from the radio and screaming at the top of their lungs in the car. So I take to my snap and post a joke \"send prayers my way. I left a football game for this\" on my story. Then the girl sees it on my snap and calls me out and I say \"yea it's a joke\" and she starts asking both me and my friend why we are mad at (R) and her. For 30 minutes we had to ride in a car with these two girls singing \"hoes mad\" mockingly while blasting cardi b. ( (R) is a really good friend and she never acts like this until tonight and even when we hang out with her and that girl she starts to be bitchy). So we drop the girl off at her car and my friend drops me off at my house. Then in a gc (R) calls us both out for toxic masculinity. And not wanting to start a fight, I just drop it. Then the next day i said \"why did you act like a bitch to us\" and she says that she is allowed to have multiple personalities and if I dont like it I can go away. \n\nWhat the hell do I do?", "subreddit": "FriendshipAdvice"}

My only requirement is that you are around my age, so anywhere from 16-19.\n\nMy hobbies and what I like:\n\n.Listening to music (Fave artists, clairo and the 1975)\n\n.Drawing (I keep a journal of drawings and could show you some of them if you're interested)\n\n.Creative writing or just writing away\n\n.Watching Netflix (maybe too much)\n\n.Cooking\n\n.Nature (makes me feel at home)\n\n.Playing video games like Minecraft\n\n.Reading books\n\n.Space related things (I just like learning stuff about space for fun)\n\n.I'm a big foodie\n\n.Giving presents\n\n.Finding meaning for things\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\nI recently developed the passion for creative writing and have been searching for ways of expressing myself. If you are interested in knowing this, I can speak English and Persian fluently and I'm currently learning French too. I love learning about different cultures and I'd love to travel around the world when I'm older.\n\nHope you got know me better and thanks for reading. You don't have to like all the same things as me btw I thought I'd just say that. Byeeee :D\n\nAlso if anyone sends me a message saying 'hey', I'm not going to answer. I'm sorry but from experience people who start a conversation like that aren't going to stay.", "subreddit": "Needafriend"}

Before he became a mod we talked in Xbox parties and on discord daily for hours at a time, but about a month passes of him being a mod and all of a sudden we start talking maybe once a week, and it isn't like he didn't get my messages because it shows whether he's online or not, he's actively choosing to ignore my messages. Whenever I send him something relating to what I enjoy he either outright ignores it or sends 1 or 2 letter responses and than changes the topic to his fucking Minecraft server, and he became an admin today so it's definitely gonna start getting worse. I just feel like me and my interests arent being respected. I went to his house maybe 3 times since he became mod and we barely did anything, he just sat on his server talking to some randoms and told me to be quiet when I tried to initiate a conversation. It's either he's legitimately addicted to Minecraft because he's clocked hundreds of hours into the game since becoming a mod or he's starting to hate me.", "subreddit": "FriendshipAdvice"}

Ive posted a few times on here but never had much luck. I keep it kind of vague on these posts. But ill try to put in a little more detail. I live on the east coast of the USA. I work full time, 5 or 6 days a week. When im not working im typically playing video games. I play on Pc and Xbox. I play CSGO, Overwatch, Risk of Rain 2, Minecraft (occassionally), Rocket Leauge, Forza, and a lot of other games. I am a huge music junkie. I listen to all genres besides country. I pretty much just rotate what i listen to. Some of my favorites are Mutemath, Muse, Glass Animals, NF, The Unlikely Candidates  and Cold War Kids. Family life is shit and now that my sister is married and living with her husband (very happy for them. Just sucks that one of the people i could always talk to is working two jobs and lives a few hours away). Dont have many friends since i dropped out of college since. I work in a field where people are typically older. They are all cool and all but they all have their family lives to live. Lifes just kind of  rough in general right now.

It does no good to get 1 million messages that all fizzle out after a week and no friendships are made. I'm okay with getting fewer responses as long as the responses I get are meaningful.**\n\nLooking to create a funny group chat &amp; close friendships. I have made a post similar to this in another sub a while ago and actually managed to find 2 people who I have kept up a real friendship with. So, taking another swing at it and hoping to replicate the results with a few more people.\n\nNot looking for too many people, as the goal is to really get to know each other and form genuine, lasting friendships and that's harder with more people. Really want it to be about 10 or less.\n\nLooking for people who will eventually want to start video chatting, texting, watching movies together (virtually), playing video games together (console, PC, or party type games like Jackbox), sending each other cards, adding each other on social media, or whatever else. Possibly even meeting up one day, depending on where people are located. Not really looking for people who want to remain anonymous or just keep the friendship on reddit.\n\nIdeally looking for people who will be active in the chat pretty much every day (obviously life happens and sometimes you can't be, but you get my meaning). Ideally looking for people who have some shared interests with me, but also with each other as well. Ideally looking for people at least somewhat near to my age (around 20 - around 30). I am not all that picky about gender in this case. I have had both male and female friends over the years.\n\nLocation isn't the most important thing on earth, but, in order to keep things active, I prefer people whose timezone is at least not the complete opposite of mine (I am in the U.S.A.). For example, if the group wanted to watch a movie together tonight on Rabbit at 8pm eastern time, would your time zone permit this? If it would not, this may not be the group for you.\n\n**About Me:**\n\n26 / F. African American. Finished grad school last year. Working in the psychology field and the education field currently.\u00a0 Unmarried (so far). No kids. As far as my personality, I'm generally a pretty calm and easygoing person.\n\nThese are the types of stupid things I find funny, just to give you a feel for my sense of humor:  \n[https://youtu.be/ZHfuB-\\_pAQA](https://youtu.be/ZHfuB-_pAQA)\n\n[https://youtu.be/mHOxHtRcJPw](https://youtu.be/mHOxHtRcJPw)\n\n**Favorite Subreddits Include:**\n\n[/r/ChoosingBeggars](https://www.reddit.com/r/ChoosingBeggars)\n\n[/r/FloridaMan](https://www.reddit.com/r/FloridaMan)\n\n[/r/OldPeopleFacebook](https://www.reddit.com/r/OldPeopleFacebook)\n\n[/r/90DayFiance](https://www.reddit.com/r/90DayFiance/)\n\n[/r/IAmTheAsshole](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmTheAsshole/)\n\n**My General Interests:**\n\n**Languages:** I speak English and some Italian. Planning to learn other languages in the future.\n\n**Books:** Mostly fiction. Some children's books. If I read nonfiction, it's usually some kind of true crime.\n\n**TV:** I watch a fair amount of tv. I like American &amp; British dramas (This Is Us, Breaking Bad, The Wire, Insecure, Luther, Sherlock, Desperate Housewives) / comedies (Black-ish, Shameless, Atlanta). I also like comedy-news shows (The Daily Show / Last Week Tonight) and love trashy reality shows (90 Day Fiance / Love After Lockup). I also like trashy dramas as well (Pose, Claws). Currently watching Black Mirror.\n\n**Movies:** Mostly like Dramas, Thrillers, and Comedies. I also enjoy Horror movies that are genuinely scary or so bad that they make me laugh.\n\n**Video Games:**\u00a0Used to have a PS4. Now play mostly on the computer. Sims is what I play most often.\u00a0I have played and enjoyed Detroit: Become Human, GTA V, SpiderMan, Fallout 4, Life Is Strange, Firewatch, and other games like that. \u00a0\n\n**Travel:** I have been to a few different countries and have lived in several states. Hoping to travel around more in the future.\n\n**Music:** I like Adele, Bruno Mars, Beyonce, Carrie Underwood, Ed Sheeran, Florence &amp; The Machine, Imagine Dragons, Hamilton Soundtrack, The Lonely Island, etc. Those are just the artists who I seem to have a lot of songs by on my phone.\n\nSo, if it sounds like we have things in common and might make good friends, feel free to shoot me a message. And again, I know this is a lot of information, but I am really looking for compatibility here and not something that fizzles out after a week because we have nothing to talk about and nothing in common.", "subreddit": "Needafriend"}

I\u2019m currently sitting and crying. I\u2019m a very happy person and when I cry I\u2019m truly heartbroken. \nA person I used to want to call my best friend had finally made me reach my breaking point. \nI\u2019m so genuinely hurt because I used to think that I\u2019m spending the rest of my life with this person. I\u2019ve been abandoned so many times before by my friends, and I though that she would be my best friend for life. \nI don\u2019t even have the capacity to fit in here just how many times she\u2019s made me cry or feel anxious. And I loved and supported her every day. Every time she would come crying to me, I put her above all. I supported her every step, was her shoulder to cry on every time she was sad. I poured all of my loving heart to help her feel better yet she would never be satisfied with what I did to help her. \nEvery time I was sad and told her how I felt, her reply would be \u2018what can I do\u2019. \nI HELPED HER EVERY TIME, EVERY GODDAMN TIME SHE WAS SAD. I literally cannot type right now I\u2019m shaking and I\u2019m hurt. \nEvery time she would get sad or angry over something, I felt bad for her because I know her relationship with her parents is unfortunately really bad. I know this and I am always there to talk to her about it. \nI just can\u2019t help it. I am always there to support her, always, always and every time. \nRight now I feel terrible because my mom came in to ask me if I\u2019m okay, but I had to lie to her because I don\u2019t want her to see that I\u2019m crying over this. I love my mother, I love her so much. I love her more than anything in this world and I hate remembering the times where I would put this girl over my mom. \nShe would force me into talking with her even when I myself was in a bad situation. I\u2019d have to leave a dinner table to go talk to her if she was upset, and if I wouldn\u2019t, she\u2019d call me all types of mean things. Then I would cry not understanding what I did wrong when I can\u2019t rip myself apart. \nEven literally now we were talking about me balancing homework with watching TV series and she started suspecting that I wasn\u2019t really busy and was purposefully ignoring her. I am a grade 11 DP student and currently have homework for every subject. She told me that she wanted to talk to me because she had anxiety over family issues. I told her that I am willing to talk right now and want to listen. Her reply was that she wouldn\u2019t want to talk to me anymore as I am busy. I never replied, but I screenshotted it. She recently deleted what she sent. \nI\u2019m not writing this to seek attention. I\u2019ve been subjected to long term mental abuse and manipulation from a person who I though was the true friend that life had given to me. I\u2019m coming from a place of hurt and desperation and I really, really, really want someone\u2019s help. Please help me, I can\u2019t do this anymore.

{"post_id": "cyimzo", "created_utc": 1567388657, "title": "Am I a bad friend or is my good friend a little codependent?", "author": "mere_jorg", "self_text": " \n\nI'm looking for validation, advice, or those who can relate to what I'm experiencing. Don't think my situation is that unique, so I'm sure someone could give some feedback (which would be greatly appreciated).\n\nMy main situation and issue has to do with one of my best friends who I met in college. I am currently 29 (female) and married for the last three years. My good friend is female, 30 and living with a serious significant other. My husband and I run our own independent illustration business (which is very time consuming) and are on a tight budget. Despite working primarily from home, our time isn't as flexible as you would think. Due to this and having to maintain other relations, my friend and I see each other anywhere from once/twice every 1-2 months or once every 3-4 months, depending on how particularly busy we each are. We also live 50 minutes to 1.5 hours away from each other (depending on traffic).\n\nFor about the past year, my friend has been very dissatisfied with this arrangement. Every time we talk (via phone, text, fb etc) , 99% of the time she says she misses me, and we need to see each other more, and asks when can we hang out, says she will pay for things (which I don't want her to do too much) etc. She has been doing it to the point that I find myself avoiding contact with her (even just for fun). I've told her that when we can't see each other, I'd love to connect through other means (like phone calls, online games etc), which we used to do a lot (so it doesn't seem that far from what we'd normally do anyway). She initially agreed to that, but she has gone back to saying how much she misses hanging out. Just the other day she sent me a drunk text saying she misses hanging out so much and how much she misses me.\n\nI think friends should want to make each other happy but not be reliant on each for their happiness (if that makes sense), or to complete each other which is what she seems to expect from me to an extent.\n\nI don't feel I am in the wrong. I am genuinely giving what I feel I can give under my particular circumstances. But I still care for her as a friend and want to make her happy, but it seems she doesn't really appreciate what I give to her. For instance, the last time we got together we went shopping together for 3-4 hours (well, I couldn't really buy anything, but shopping was something she said she wanted to do together again so I made it happen). When I mentioned the time that I would likely head on back home (which was partially based on her bedtime for work the next day) she seemed disappointed and annoyed. And she made a comment along the lines of \"I didn't think you cared so little about me\" as a response to something else in our conversation (almost like she was on the ready to say or assume something emotional or negative in relation to me).\n\nI know that two of her other good friends have been sort of MIA, so I understand if she is having anxieties over losing friends, but I have not done anything to indicate that I want to \"leave.\"\n\nI would love to continue doing what we are doing except have more in between communication, but she seems to want more then what I can give right now.\n\nI've thought of other solutions, but based on experience I know they ultimately wouldn't work out. One solution is based on my friend saying she should come over to our house after her work to wait through the rush hour traffic. I thought about that possibility but quickly realized that neither myself nor my husband would want a regular house guest when we should otherwise be working. And the dynamic between the three of us (her, myself and my husband) is not the most fun. For one thing, if she did come over to our house, she would say passive-aggressive and guilt-inducing things to my husband to make him feel bad for not inviting her over more often, or \"letting\" me see her more. This sort of thing has happened multiple times in the past (which is actually one of the reasons I also don't really want to invite her over. And those times happened when I was able to see her more often, so I can only imagine how much she would do that now). When she makes her weird remarks, I am ALWAYS nice and understanding. I have literally never gotten upset or mad with her.\n\nI've also thought about the possibility of inviting her to go grocery shopping with me, or grab coffee or lunch (if budget permits), but as mentioned before, I feel she would insist on staying together longer, invite herself over, or be upset that it is only a quick get together. And not to mention, the guilt-tripping.\n\nIt seems that as long as we aren't spending days and days or hours upon hours together, she is not satisfied, which makes my efforts seem unappreciated.\n\nBut maybe I'm wrong. Most people I speak to seem to think she's being dramatic. But I don't want to be oblivious of myself either.\n\nSo I am curious. What do you think? Any advice? Any relatable stories and outcomes of your own? I'd really appreciate the feedback.", "subreddit": "FriendshipAdvice"}

And this is a ridiculous amount of backstory but idk it feels important? Skip to the end if anything\n      This morning I got two texts from my friend. One at 5 saying that she got home, one at 10 saying that she loves me. Nothing out of the ordinary honestly. Last night she got into a minor car accident, the car is messed up but she was totally fine. She called me, she had a safe way home w a mutual friend (20m) , I told her to lmk she got home as I had work this morning, and I went to bed. \nSo when I woke up to a text saying \u201cI love you\u201d I didn\u2019t think anything of it. I knew she had to be up this morning to meet AAA about the car and I knew she was sad about it. When we\u2019re sad about stuff, sometimes we just shoot a text or a quick call, all we say is \u201cI love you\u201d maybe everything will be okay, but it\u2019s typically just something we do cause it makes us feel better in the moment. I texted her back saying, \u201ci love you too mama.\u201d And then I asked her about the car and AAA and what happened. She didn\u2019t respond, but I figured given how late she was out and how early I thought she woke up to meet AAA that she would be asleep until late after noon, also something not uncommon. I called her once, didn\u2019t get an answer, saw that her location was at her house and just went to work figuring she\u2019d call me later. \n   I went about my day normally, checking my phone occasionally to see if she\u2019d texted me back. She never did. \n    Around 2pm I get a text from her dad who works out of state. He can\u2019t get in touch w her. I tell him exactly what I think is happening. She\u2019s likely  tired from a long night, I\u2019ll ask a mutual friend if they\u2019ve heard from her, if anything, I\u2019ll go and check on her as soon as I get off work.\n    I text mutual friend (L), he seems concerned as soon as he sees it - about 40 minutes later- , within 5 minutes he\u2019s on his way to check on her. This is where I get nervous.\n     He tells me when he gets there, neighbors tell him Z was taken by an ambulance earlier that day. I call the closest hospital to Z\u2019s house and thankfully she\u2019s there, I leave work and head straight there. I ask my mom what to do, Mom tells me to wait till I know Z\u2019s condition before telling her father since I don\u2019t want to scare him if it\u2019s just a migraine or something. But friend L is already there and has already told him what\u2019s going on. Z\u2019s dad asks me to keep him posted tells me that he\u2019ll be ok the first flight he can get home. He also tells me part of what happened.\nZ took a fuck ton of Tylenol, some muscle relaxer and another pill.\n    I get to the hospital and I\u2019m trying to prepare myself. I know what the aftermath of an OD looks like, i\u2019ve seen it on my dad more than my fair share of times. But just seeing Z like that, I couldn\u2019t breath, I started crying immediately, L was trying to talk to me but I just couldn\u2019t process anything in that moment. She was lifeless. Tubes everywhere, wrapped in an aluminum blanket and head piece. I don\u2019t think I said anything for the first 20 minutes, I just starred. A nurse came in for the second time before I got myself together enough to start getting it together and asking questions, filling in blank spaces explaining Z\u2019s abusive side of the family that is absolutely under no circumstances to be allowed to make medical decisions for her. They show me where Z slit her wrists, ask me if that was what was common for her, just information that her dad only had part of. And once I do this I start to see L just crumble. He\u2019s just shaking his head covering his eyes and I\u2019ve never been so thankful for someone being able to keep it together for a few minutes. Even if he needed someone else to take over, he let me get out what I needed to to be able to help in the small ways I could in the moment.\n    L tells me that Z can hear us and feel us, she just can\u2019t react. So we start making small bad jokes, Z loves those. She was wildly into the trash meme that took over tumblr in 2015 and a fly lands on her head so I make a joke about her being a trash princess - an inside joke from highschool- another joke about how metallics are not the color of the future cause the blanket is just not flattering under these lights. And L and I take turns holding Z\u2019s hand. \n     We keep Z\u2019s dad updated, where she\u2019s being moved, her condition, what they\u2019re giving her. A nurse is also doing this, but he was asking and I think he just felt better having someone he knew and trusted confirm this.\n    One of her aunts on her dads side gets to the hospital around 945, I\u2019d been there for about 4 1/2 hours at this point and they were supposed to kick us out at 930, but this wonderful nurse let us stay w her in the ICU cause she\u2019s an angel.  And I just start unfolding stuff to this woman. Nothing that could get my friend in trouble or anything, even if she may not want them to know exactly. But I just felt like I needed to. A real adult needs to know whatMs happening and what\u2019s causing this kind of sadness and desperation and lack of will to live. Someone with enough power to help it. And I tell this woman about how terribly Z\u2019s mom is to her - was? Her mom disowned her about a week ago or so and said the most disgusting things- and her ex boyfriend and how he was just like Z\u2019s mother to her, and just, how Z accepts this controlling aggressive form of \u2018love\u2019 from suitors because they grew up w that kind of love from their mother and even tho Z\u2019s father was nice he never stopper Z\u2019s mother either. And how she needs her family to actually support her and not just blow up and pretend it didn\u2019t happen and to make sure that she\u2019s actually okay and not just used to treatment. And we basically just talked about how all of us need to come together to help Z and get her the therapy she needs along w the support system from all of us to be unified and unwavering and shit like that.  \n     I guess the real question is, what do I say to Z.  I know what needs to be done as a whole. But idk how to look at her and just talk right now. She\u2019s going to be sedated for another day or so most likely, but I plan to be there for her when she wakes up and I just don\u2019t know where to go from here. I love her to pieces, it kills me that I could \u2018t help her with this and that I couldn\u2019t tell something was wrong and that it had to come to this and idk what to say to her individually rn. \n\nTLDR; my best friend tried to kill herself and idk what to say to her when she wakes up", "subreddit": "FriendshipAdvice"}

I have no idea where to post this so please forgive me if this isn\u2019t an appropriate subreddit.Maybe this is just me getting things off my chest more than anything. I don\u2019t mind if no one helps or says anything. Everyone has their own baggage to deal with. To anyone who is crazy enough to read this, my sincerest thank you to you. I do hope you enjoy my story and possibly learn something from it. Apologies for formatting on mobile, any bad grammar or spelling and for a rather long post. Feel free to ask any questions or critisize me as you see fit. There can never be progress without critisizm I guess. \n\nI\u2019m a 24 year old Asian male and I live in South East Asia. I\u2019ve rather recently graduated from private university. I got my final results back around late March or early April and took about 2 months break before properly looking for a job. I have a diploma in Aerospace Engineering and a degree in Mechanical Engineering (2nd upper) by the way. Up to this day, I\u2019ve sent near 110 job applications and I\u2019ve only gotten 1 interview. I know it hasn\u2019t been too long since I\u2019ve graduated but having only gotten 1 interview out of 110 is a pretty bad record. I\u2019m quite overweight. I\u2019m not ugly(I don\u2019t think) but my face definitely doesn\u2019t warrant the word \u2018attractive\u2019 so I guess I\u2019d describe my face as average-looking at best. I used to have alot of friends but now, that number has dwindled down to numbers I can only count with my fingers, not that it\u2019s a bad thing. I can\u2019t even grow a proper beard. At best I look like I glued armpit hair to my face. I have no hobbies. I have no motivation for anything. I have no dream. I daydream(very regularly) about me dying in impossible situations although I\u2019m not suicidal in anyway. Although I have thought about it. I don\u2019t contribute anything. I have almost no useful skills. I have no self-confidence. I feel like I\u2019m just a plague. I want to disappear. \n\nI guess the first major thing I regret about my life was my behaviour back in secondary school. I wasn\u2019t a bad kid. I was just very playful. I believe because of that, I inadvertently became a bit of a dick to my classmates. As long as I had fun I didn\u2019t really care too much about my surroundings. If I could meet myself from then, I would give him a hard kiss with my fist and tell him to have empathy for the people around him. I was so immature for my age. I remember a certain incident, among other things where I purposely unhooked a female friend\u2019s bra with 1 hand in the middle of class because I watched Charlie Sheen\u2019s character do it in 2 and a half men. Damn I hate myself for doing that I really do. At the end of my secondary school days, I somehow managed to do relatively well. I got into. Polytechnic whose engineering department offered aerospace engineering, which at the time was quite popular. This now leads to my second major regret in my life. \n\nConsidering my obnoxious behaviour in secondary school and doing rather well at the end of it, I thought I could just do it again in polytechnic. Oh if only I knew. Those 2 institutions are  totally different ball games. In poly I prioritised having friends and hanging out with them more than studying. I was throwing away my future and I couldn\u2019t see it. I joined school camps to spend more time with my friends and make new ones and that I did. All at the cost of my education. From the first semester I never had a good GPA. That should have been it. That should have been the sign that told me to get my shit together but I just ignored it, telling myself everything\u2019s going to work out in the end. I did all my studying a week before the examination period. It went as well as anyone could guess. On my second year, I failed a subject. For the first time in my life, I failed a subject. That hit me kind of hard. In order to take the semester\u2019s subject, I had to pass the one I failed. Due to my failure, all the following subjects were pushed ahead and I had to take an extra semester while all my classmates graduated. I felt like shit. I could only blame my incompetence. I wallowed in self-pity. Funny thing to do when I got exactly what I deserved. I guess from the point of that subject failure onwards, things just started to kind of snowball. I gave myself a form of depression that\u2019s been going on until this very day. I had a friend, let\u2019s called him Z(we\u2019re still very good friends and live 5 minutes apart) in the same course who always pestered me to study hard and apply for all the universities I could. All I did was scoff at the idea of university and told myself I\u2019ll get a job. A diploma is more than enough to get me through. If there was a time machine I\u2019d go back to that moment and push my past self down the stairway for doing that. All in all, I graduated from polytechnic with a meager 2.1 GPA. Who\u2019s going to hire me with such a GPA anyway. I know it\u2019s not everything but shit I wish I was better than that. \n\nAfter polytechnic I was enlisted and trained as a firefighter. My country has a conscription law and all able bodied males above the age of 18 must serve the nation in either the military, police or civil defence. I was overweight before enlistment and so I was put in the physical training phase for 2 months before actually undergoing proper recruit trianing which was a month long. I enlisted with the weight of 99.9kg and at the end of 3 months, I was around 89kg. I went on to train as a section commander(sargeant rank) for another six months and by the time I graduated from that I was probably around 75-80kg. I forgot to weigh myself at the time so I didn\u2019t how much I weigh then. I was fit and healthy and was 9 months into my 2 years of service. I regained my confidence and once again let it go to my head. I let loose and slowly gained back all the weight I lost for the next 15 months after I was placed into my unit. In fact I\u2019m fatter now that when I enlisted. At the end of my service, I once again lost my self-confidence and slipped back into the negative state of mind I was in. Another one of my big regrets. Working long and hard to better myself only to lose it all in a shitty way. \n\nNear the end of my enlistment I was asked the one thing everyone of us had to decide once we were done with serving. \u201cWhat are you going to do once you\u2019re done?\u201d I was lost for a bit on that question. One of my close friends, which I\u2019ll call S suggested going to university. Z, S and I have been close friends for a long time. Z and I have been friends for 9 years while S and I for 11. I thought about what Z said back then in polytechnic and decided to apply for a private university. It was the best I could get considering my polytechnic results. I kept an especially low profile in uni. By this time I knew how much I fucked up so far. I didn\u2019t want to mess things up so I actually tried. All in all, a 2nd upper degree in Mechanical Engineering with honors. It sounds nice and all. Though there is a kind of stigma that exists in my country that employers would rather hire local university graduates than private ones. I guess it does make sense. Local universities are much more well suited to teach and are mostly government funded compared to private universities. I just feel like I swept myself inder the rug, eliminating myself good opportunities. \n\nAnd here I am. I think this is the lowest I\u2019ve ever been. I feel second to an amoeba. I\u2019ve never really had any dreams or aspirations. The closest thing to that I could say is probably wanting to start a family. Get married and have 3 kids. Have twin daughters and an older son to take care and protect the twins. Though I do realise I\u2019m going to need to accomplish some thing before that can happen. Like I said early on. I\u2019m only average looking, I can\u2019t grow a proper beard, I have no self-confidence, no dreams, no hobbies, I\u2019m overweight, I have no motivation, I have almost zero useful real life skills. I want to change all of that. I want to better myself but I don\u2019t know how. I don\u2019t know where to start. I don\u2019t want to tell anyone I know because I\u2019ve tried telling part of this to my close friends Z and S and they just said it\u2019s okay everyone goes through things like what I told them. They didn\u2019t give me a solution/s of any kind or form. I don\u2019t want to trouble my parents any further. I want to be the best person I can but I just don\u2019t know how to even begin. Mayble I may jusy become that person in the forseeabke future. Or maybe I\u2019ll just fade into oblivion, not amounting to anything and just being a stain in people\u2019s lives. \n\nThank you very much for reading my attempt at calling for help if you made it this far.

He always complained about not having friends but he didn't even thank the whole group for the birthday cake we made him and refused to eat lunch with our group. Which led to them being pissed and me feeling bad for him. But I felt more and more violated and also isolated from others because of his actions.

He was one of my best friends since high school and even going to separate colleges, we remained close. I'm going to call him Mike but that's obviously not his real name for privacy reasons.\n\nI haven't seen Mike in almost a year and ever since college we haven't gotten to see each other much. I'm used to us having hung out every single day, and it isn't the same sending memes or whatever in texts compared to actually hanging out and doing things together.\n\nI see some of my other friends once a month or we do sleepovers every few months. I'm a girl and he's a guy, but for me anyway I'd be totally cool with a sleepover twice a year or so if that was easier.\n\nI just don't feel important to him or as a priority in his life. I've been really low and wanted my best friend, and he couldn't make the time for me. Other things are always more important.\n\nHe works kind of close to my house sometimes, so I try to get him to come over here. But I've also mentioned the possibility of me going to his place even though I know it can be kind of rude to invite myself over. He says he wants to hang out, but thing always seem to come up.\n\nHe recently got a girlfriend and I feel like since then it has been even harder for him to make time for me. He didn't even tell me about her for months, but when my boyfriend told me he wanted to marry me, I let Mike and some of my other friends know immediately.\n\nHe does work a lot, but he lives at home with his parents and his only bills are car payments/insurance and student loans. I've got those too, plus rent, utilities, food, etc. And I make less money but still have enough time outside of work. \n\nRecently, things that have been more important thank keeping plans with me are:\n\n1. going to the fair with his parents and sibling (they go every year as a tradition. I had already canceled a tradition of mine in HOPES that we could hang out that day, because if he was able to come over on a day off from work I'd want to be free to spend time together.) \n\n2. Having to be home before nine because of his parents rules and not liking to drive at dark. I mentioned earlier he's welcome to sleep over.\n\n3. His grandparent's 38th wedding anniversary. He didn't want them to be alone, despite all of the other family going. If it was 50, 40, even 35, okay. But 38...\n\n4. His girlfriend's dog is sick. I actually understand this, but she is a LDR and he can Skype her from here while I make dinner or whatever. And he was never there for me as a friend when I was sad, so I do feel a little hurt that he hasn't been there for me lately even though I've known him for almost 40x as long. \n\n\nTLDR: Friend of 20 yrs can't hang out with me after I already cleared my schedule for this because he forgot his grandparents' 38th anniversary was today. I don't feel very important.", "subreddit": "FriendshipAdvice"}

Maybe not all encounters last, but whether we're still talking or parted ways, thank you. We all have learnt something more about ourselves and that's good. \n\nI don't know if this belongs in a journal or nah. But we are in a oversharing society so... I'm just sitting on my full size bed, my hair in two braided buns for sleep, and... of course I'm restless. I need to get some things off my boobs.\n\nToxic. Friendships. That's right this content is exactly what the title says, no click bait (though I did use the word boobs... twice now before said content, so... I don't know, all boobs are beautiful, including you man boobs, we see you \u2661).\n\nOkay here goes. For one thing, toxic friendships can be hard to get out of, especially if you hadn't pick up on the toxicity for YEARS. If you're like me and your friends have made you too insecure to walk away, because they have you believing no one else will accept you, F*CK. THAT. NOISE. \n\nYou deserve to feel equal. You deserve to feel heard. You deserve to be supported, period!\n\nIt's not normal to feel minimized. It's not normal to feel like you're walking on eggshells when you want to express yourself. No, in a healthy friendship you're each other's sound board in a judgement free zone. Granted not all friends are deep, not every one is a 'ride or die', but you get the idea. You should feel good approaching each other not unease and insecure. \n\nI guess I just hope you can feel more strength and resolve from my post when discerning friendships. You know what you need and you learned what you won't tolerate. No more people who use you. \n\nAnd an add on... for people who feel rejected on here or in life, as someone who's been rejected or just sort of forgotten, things drifted if you will- don't take it personally. They weren't right for you. And you don't need extra empty baggages. \n\nAnother add on... This subreddit is called r/NeedaFriend, NOT r/NeedaFriendWithBenefits, or r/NeedaDate. Even as someone who's fallen for these traps, I just want to call out the people who butter you up for sexual stuff. Just stop. So inappropriate.\n\nAnyway, maybe you're feeling low or anxious right now. It's hard to believe in yourself, but if you're doing your best that's all any of us can do. It's going to be okay. Good things are coming \u2661\n\nI don't know how to end this...\n\nHappy Friendship Hunting...? \n\nThat just sounds awkward, but I'm going to leave it, so you can snort/laugh or whatever at my expense.\n\nXOXO,\n\nPoetry Girl", "subreddit": "Needafriend"}

Secondly, I'd love to start a friendship with a Muslim person, as a recent convert and living in a country with one of the lowest amount of followers of Islam in the world - I'm struggling to practise my religion in a proper way and I believe that having someone to talk about faith with, would be very much beneficial. I like to mix both long and deep discussions about certain topics with rather casual, daily talk. I'm up to messaging apps, Reddit DMs, e-mails and even traditional letters - whatever suits you best. If the second person is willing to, we could even send each other some packages with traditional snacks/postcards or hand-made things, that sounds exciting. From my personal experience I tend to have better connections with women as they mostly are more patient and up for longer and more engaging talks, but I accept everyone no matter the gender/age or ethnicity.\n\nFew more things about me:\n\n\\- I'm a rather calm person that doesn't like to party and is free of alcohol or any drugs\n\n\\- I love nature, going for a walk in a forest, walk by a lake or visiting parks\n\n\\- Riding a bike alongside with listed above long walks are my favourite forms of spending time outside\n\n\\- For a good year I've been massively struggling health-wise, but now getting better\n\n\\- I'm free from prejudices and stay off from politics\n\n\\- I don't like memes much and not find most of them particularly funny\n\n\\- I used to listen to metal music, but lately I almost completely switched to Psymbient/Psychill/Chillstep and Nasheeds\n\n\\- I follow football a lot, but mainly fixtures of my national league\n\n\\- I'm very interested into games and I'd be willing to play some online ones with you\n\n\\- I like to make some photos and videos of my daily life and would like to share it with you\n\n\\- I try to eat healthy\n\n\\- I stay away from the NSFW content\n\n\\- Recently I've started to learn Arabic\n\n\\- I don't have any pet, but I love watching various videos about them and play with ones that belong to my family\n\n\\- I'm a person that is willing to listen, support and give honest opinions on different matters", "subreddit": "Needafriend"}

So I sent her a message telling that and that me, she and the other friend could go together with my parents but her boyfriend probably could go with us. And that\u2019s when everything started. She got mad at me and suddenly said she\u2019d go alone with him and that she couldn\u2019t cancel anything with him. I got angry too cause we always went together to that event and the she suddenly say she couldn\u2019t cancel it with him but me. I sent one message arguing about it and then she blocked me. We haven\u2019t talked for a week.\nMaybe I acted a little bit wrong when I said he could join us, but we could still rent a car and everything but she didn\u2019t even think about it. Then I started thinking if she\u2019d like to go only because of him, and he doesn\u2019t even like books (it was a book event).\nWhat should I do?\nI\u2019m getting sick about that friendship because every time we have a fight I\u2019m always the one who apologizes even if I\u2019m the right one.

I am a social person and have a vast array of hobbies yet, it never feels like anybody has the slightest bit interest while the people who generally are rude and deemed cool cause they party and such are like a magnet. A good example for me is that I was a great ice hockey goalie and had the privilege to play varsity all four years of high school. My sophomore year i had played every game and my junior year I helped my team go to our first championship since the 80s.  I am not saying this to boast, but to merely get my point across. No one ever acknowledged me about it. Instead after games, girls would flock to the guys that were nothing more than a \"cool and popular\" kid. and aside from hockey, i perform music and write and produce music. Anytime I promote it, no one gives a shit. Anytime chad the privileged rich drops his mumble rap tape, everyones on it like flys on horse shit.\n\nI am not saying this bash these people or writing this to get attention. I am putting this out there for people who just feel like they are invisible. I would have many days in my youth and teens feeling like something is wrong with me.

The backstory is long and complex, so I\u2019ll do my best to convey the situation without typing a novel. The main point: I\u2019m asking for advice to help me figure out whether or not I should continue to be his friend.\n\nWe\u2019ve been friends for a few years now, and throughout that time I\u2019ve learned that he\u2019s just the type of person that doesn\u2019t make plans with other people. He likes to hang out with people, and has fun doing so, but from what I\u2019ve experienced and heard from mutual friends is that he VERY rarely is the one to try to make plans with someone. This has put some emotional stress on me, I think mainly because I\u2019m at a point in my life where I\u2019m really trying to figure out who is worth my time and care, and who to leave behind because they\u2019re just not good for me. I almost always feel like I\u2019m annoying him when I try to make plans or text in general. A few weeks ago I felt like I was reaching a breaking point of just wanting to give up and not even try to be his friend, so I pretty much asked for affirmation from him. He made it clear that he does want to be friends with me.\n\nI guess my main problem comes from always feeling like I\u2019m being annoying, or being \u201ctoo much\u201d. He\u2019s a very logical person, isn\u2019t really in tune to his or anyone else\u2019s emotions, and to top it off has never had a strong friendship with a girl, which I think makes him uncomfortable because he\u2019s not really sure how platonic relationships work. So to get to the point of this, should I continue to be his friend even though it tends to bring a lot of negative emotions out in me? I care about him a lot, and would hate to not be friends with him. I just can\u2019t tell if this is one those times that I need to put myself first or not.", "subreddit": "friendship"}

I\u2019ve always felt I never really had any friends from about 5th grade to the present.(with some exceptions that I\u2019ll mention later) I can\u2019t remember exactly when but at some point in elementary school I had a mental breakdown, after just getting fed up with people and not understanding why they would be mean to me and do what they did; I stared crying and was screaming f*ck my life, f*ck the world and people I try to be friends with. A teacher comes over and gets me to calm down and at some point I decided to forget that memory and try something different. I would always eat alone at the lunch tables or eat in the library by myself and never go out with everyone else because most of the time I would just stand around and look at the other kids. And I\u2019m like 10 at the time.  Anyways I started middle school and things were pretty much the same; I ate alone at lunch and never went to the gym or outside during lunch when we had the chance. I was what you could call a loner, with some few people that I would talk to occasionally. I get through middle school with good grades. My freshman year of high school I joined the xc running team, and this was one of the first times that I felt I had friends because they also did xc and we all sat together in the lunch room. However as the year went on I noticed that I would always be there for my \u201cfriends\u201c if they needed anything and I mean anything, but they could never return the favor in the slightest. At this point I was just glad to be around a group of people who shared common interests with me. But this is enough rambling. If I\u2019m willing to help my friends and they can\u2019t even try to do the same for me, then are they a good friend? And why do I never get invited to go camping, or on hiking trips or adventures with them? I don\u2019t think that I\u2019m doing anything wrong am I? \n\nBut I did have one real friend I know for sure, she graduated last year and was always willing to go do stuff with me and possibly the most understanding, caring, and loving person I\u2019ve met.

An elven-like digital painting of a man that she claimed took her 15 hours.

These are the people that have known me for years and know most of my secrets, but at the end of the day, they blow with the breeze, sometimes even making me feel bad about decisions. \n\nDon't get me wrong, we've had some good times together. These are the people I usually head to the bar with, check out new restaurants with, and other casual social hoopla. I've even gone on vacation with them. But most of the time they don't energize me, they drain me. They'll sometimes make me feel bizarre for doing things a certain way or even put me down for it in front of people. \n\nSome background: I work with these guys. That's how we all met some 11 years ago. But one of them puts me down \"jokingly\" even at work in from of subordinates. \n\nAnother one lied to me last week re: one of our clients. They worked on something I pitched to the client behind my back. I only found out because it didn't perform well and one of my other \"friends\" wanted to get my opinion of what can be fixed. I feel like they all use me in one way or another.\n\nI should also mention that I suffer from chronic depression. It's a battle I fight every couple of years or and it's hard for me to find people to trust, people who I can be me with without judgement during this time. I've mentioned in other posts how great it feels for me when a friend just comes over and sits with me, watching tv or whatever, when I'm feeling like this. These are not the friends that do that. They are the friends that break plans a half hour before we're supposed to meet (on a holiday no less) because it's raining and I \"live too far\". Let's put it this way, when I bought my house (a pretty big accomplishment for me) and it was time to move, these guys were no where to be found. They were all too busy.\n\nSo, my question is, do I keep these friends and just call it what it is fair-weather acquaintances or cut them loose? Are these friends necessary to keep balance in our social circles or do they just end up doing more harm to your well-being than good?", "subreddit": "friendship"}

I need some help! I have a friend who had a bit of an outburst the other day. She's 31, I'm 25, we live together. We had a grill day at our apartment over the weekend. I had the idea to have some people over for some grilled food and didn't put much thought into it. Apparently, she thought about it all week and was super excited, despite not mentioning it once. \n\nThe meal was on Saturday and we ended up having a big night on Friday night with my boyfriend, her and another friend. We were out drinking and dancing until 4 am and having fun.  I slept at my boyfriend's place on Friday into Saturday. He suggested that we go to the pool to try and work off our hangover. We were there and realized we didn't want to leave. We said, \"fuck it. we'll be late.\" I texted my friend and said so, even suggesting maybe we should cancel. Her response was \"I already bought stuff and people are coming.\" I also told anyone who I mentioned the party to that I wouldn't be there until a later time and to maybe adjust their plans so that she wouldn't have to entertain anyone on my behalf.  \n\nMy boyfriend and I showed up 2 hours later - exactly like we said we would - with food, he brought his instrument to play some music (which everyone loved), he even ran out to get some fire starter to get the grill going. We did everything we said we would even if we were late.  (Side note - I'm typically punctual to a fault, this is the only time in the last like 6 months that I can remember being late). Everyone had a lot of fun, we played games, drank, ate, etc. \n\n Anyway, the group dwindled down to the four of us who had gone out on Friday. She decided to say to me across a fun conversation between my boyfriend and other friend that if I wanted to cancel I should have just said so (I did, but came anyway because she insisted) and that I \"don't care\". When I responded with a \"Well I do care...\" she said \"If you say so.\" to which I responded with an \"Ok...\". I tried to get the two guys out as quick as possible because she obviously wasn't happy and needed some time. When one of the guys said to her, \"Ok, we're out.\" she came in from the balcony, threw a lighter on the table, and mumbled something to the tune of \"I'm going for a walk or something I can't fucking be here right now.\" and literally stormed out. We left and went home.\n\nShe texted the next day (Sunday) and apologized for the outburst and said that even though it was a bad time to say it, that she's been thinking about it for a while and we can talk about it another time. I was still pretty pissed so I said, \"Ok. I'll be by to drop off rent later.\" She texted again today (Tuesday) and said she was home and able to talk if I wanted to - I don't - regardless, I was asleep. \n\nBasically, my problem is that she and I have had a difficult situation in the past which was caused by her. Her way of fixing it was basically guilting me into having these long conversations about our relationship. I hate it. You can only sit across the table while eating pad thai and watching someone cry so many times before you begin to wonder if it's worth it. She's moving home in a few weeks anyway, and I'm not really interested in spending the rest of the time she's here trying to convince her I care. \n\nAm I terrible?? What do I do?

Of course that isn't my real name but it makes things less formal and a  little more comfortable. I'm here to look for someone to talk to.\n\nBut before we start, I want to tell you a little bit about myself. I don't want anyone getting the wrong idea that this is something light and airy because it isn't. I also do things in a weird way. You'll see.\n\nMy story begins being born as all of ours does. Before I could remember though, my family would split and go through something I could never hope to understand. The divorce was apparently very messy but until this day I don't know the actual story. It involved my apparent kidnapping.\n\nMy father tells me my mother gave me up to him and says she was just being a bitter woman for no other apparent reason than to be that way. My mother claims abuse both emotional and physical and rape of which I'm also apparently the product of.\n\nFor the most part I wouldn't know the past and I existed in blissful servitude to my mother. Yes you read that right. A servant. Ironic how I excel at being a server as a profession in real life. Feels like a slap in the face really. An ironic mocking of an event in my life. Regardless, things would change. I would meet my father for longer than a weekend or summer vacation.\n\nSuddenly something happened. Violence. Enough to back up my mother. I always claimed it wasn't true. Always wanted to believe that but I knew now what cowardice looked like. Whatever was eating up at my dad continues to do so to this day. He did once admit to slapping her once. A little progress and a bit of the puzzle. He left me behind with a monster. I would learn later that my mother was abused by her  own family. And though the matriarch of the abuse is dead, my mother continues to live in that disillusion. She believes herself to be a being of endless power trapped in a mortal coil as a test before being reincarnated as a god. A stark change from the woman that studied at university to become a crime scene investigator.\n\nShe had an unusual fascination with death and even delighted in the minds of serial killers taking joy in how similar she was to them and even exclaiming how easy it would be to get away with murder. She married again to my step father. A man I thought loved me but a simple betrayal of the heart would get him in the end. While he was PCSed in Korea, my mother found another lover.\n\nShe claims abuse but I fear she doesn't recognize abuse and craves power. My stepfather came home and put the pieces together. I tried to console him but all he wanted to do was beat me to a pulp. 2 pieces of my heart shattered. My father and now the faux father I clinged to wanted nothing more to do with me because of this woman.\n\nHate began to stir in my heart as the inevitable happened. She became convinced that I was just like my father despite never being raised by him. The violence grew from slaps to belts to wires to close fist punches. I  never fought back no matter how I bled because her and I both knew she would win if the cops got involved. She was good like that. Able to persuade or sleep her way through any situation.\n\nI remember the agony of it all. Months and once an entire year locked in my room as a punishment. 24/7 only let out for the restroom and to clean as ordered. Control became the name of the game and she even pit siblings against one another just to watch it fight. What's weird is that it wasn't always bad. I love my mother and my father and my stepfather and everyone. I  love them all so much but I always get burned.\n\nI don't want to hurt anymore and I want to grow but try as I might, the flashbacks hold me back. I need someone to be able to really look at this broken toy and want to fix it. I honestly don't know if I can last much longer. I don't want some faux pick me up \"you are worthy\" bullshit. I want to talk to someone who can take me in for the undeveloped weird dude I am and help me heal. I'm frail and I'm weak and this isn't anywhere close to everything I  want to talk about and it's hard but I'm reaching out my hand for a friend.", "subreddit": "Needafriend"}

I go to the main area of the school to look for her, no sign of her. Eventually, I give up and go to the library. Within maybe 5-10 minutes, I see her and her other friends walking together when I look out the library window. Oof. Looking back at it now, it\u2019s possible that she may have gone back to that specific area of the school to look for me and when she saw I was no longer there (probably bc I was searching for her), she chose to go with her friends. However, I did text her to ask her where she is and the text wasn\u2019t read. I\u2019m kind of a flakey person, especially with her because our schedules never line up, I\u2019m a busy person with strict parents, and sometimes I don\u2019t even read the texts for plans that she sends me because I don\u2019t see the notifications. However, whenever I have to cancel, I always make sure to notify her, apologize and reschedule. I\u2019m kind of blaming myself here because she might just be tired of me or something and decided to go with her own friends, but I still can\u2019t help but think that what she did was pretty...crappy.

I was engaged at the time to my high-school sweetheart (now married) in the navy. My new friend knew I was engaged but still put on the moves, light flirting and hugging me, not too bad at first. Eventually I became uncomfortable and felt like I was being unfaithful to my fianc\u00e9, so I told my friend to take it down a notch. \n\nWhen I asked him to do this, he became extremely upset and jealous. He guilted me into continuing doing these things again, and the situation was unresolved. I wanted to just be friends, but this was too much. \n\nSuddenly, I got accepted to my dream university and I would be starting in January of that year. I would be moving about 2 hours from where I lived now. I told my friend, and he wasn\u2019t happy for me at all, whenever I brought it up he would say how sad it was and how I was leaving him. He made me promise to visit him whenever I got the chance, I agreed because our college was close to my family and I would want to visit them as well. \n\nAt my new university I kept in contact with him, texting mostly. He asked me time and time again when I was going to come see him, and I told him I was really busy with my classes (I was, between work and school I had no time for myself). For a while we stopped talking. \n\nA mutual friend of ours contacted me and told me that he was suicidal and was telling people it was my fault. I was so upset that I texted him and told him I\u2019d make it up, I was coming home in a few weeks, why don\u2019t we go get lunch? \n\nNo reply. \n\nHe texted back saying that he would give me another chance (for what?) but he wanted me to know that he can\u2019t trust me because I abandoned him. \n\nMaybe this is where I should\u2019ve thought to myself that it\u2019s toxic but I was really na\u00efve. I called my best friend from highschool and she told me that I need to stop being friends with him, that this was unhealthy. I was used to going months without seeing my friends, but we would always be close no matter what. \n\nInstead of telling him I didn\u2019t want to be friends anymore, I cut contact. Maybe not the smartest decision, looking back on it. \n\nThis was about half a year ago, and I thought I had blocked him on everything. A recent Instagram hack made me dm all the people that follow me a link that gives them a virus. I messaged him telling him not to open it, end of story.\n\nBut earlier this week he messaged me again saying:\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know how to say this to you, I gave you so many chances and you ruined them all. I was never good enough for you, was I? Goodbye (my name), do not contact me again.\u201d \n\nThis situation it a shitshow, and I realize that I made some mistakes, and cutting him off wasn\u2019t a good idea.

My friends are sophomores. I have one more year left (2 years as a senior) as I transferred in from a different school.\n\nI've struggled to create a \"group\" of friends since 8th grad.e. I haven't had a core gang that really hung out often ever. \n\nFinally I transfer in to this new school after failing at my previous university to do so and failing to make any lasting connections when I did a semester working in Florida. Hell, I was outcasted when I did a short study abroad in a group of 8. No one ever *disliked* me I just didn't generate really close connections. I see most of them meeting to hang out all the time which proves I just wasn't seen as a friend. The same thing in Florida, they *liked* me, but not enough to invite me to much. And the themed has continued for much of my life. For the most part, they don't seem bothered by me or think my presence is annoying or that I'm too quiet I just tend to be \"the nice one\" in most social scenarios.\n\nIt wasn't until I decided I should transfer schools that I made a group of friends. Ones that would go out and do fun things on the weekend, that liked board games and movies. Ones that would make sure I went downstairs to dinner with them (As I decided I should live in the dorms to meet people). It was my little friend utopia.  I kept very good grades and maintained a very healthy social life whereas previously I spent my waking hours  doing homework from dawn till dusk.\n\nThey were all freshmen, I was a junior who had transferred in and was taking sophomore or lower-level courses so granted the workload was low in comparison. \n\nI loved them, I told them a few times I had struggled making friends in the past and that they really made some of the heartbreak and depression I went through in the past easier to overcome.  Granted I don't think they ever totally acknowledged that when I said I had *No one*  I talked to regularly senior year  (aside from my three Low maintence friends that were all elsewhere at a different school, with early release or busy with work and theatre) and that is was so bad I didn't host a graduation party. I don't think they fully took into account how much they meant to me.\n\nI was also recovering from my first heartbreak. One that completely tore me into shreds as throughout  my first university he was most literally the person I talked to my last semester there. He was all I had and I put alot of emotional dependence on him because of that. I should have never done that, but I didn't know better he was my first. But when he broke up and then finally ghosted me. I was alone. I had no friend, including the low maintence ones I called for their help  understood my pain. None had been in a serious relationship. So after the first night of love and support they were gone. Gone because they didn't realize how painful a breakup can be. (8 months later one went through her first breakup that tore her friendgroup apart and she apologized for not realizing how shitty a first breakup is and not being there)\n\nSo yes I have maintained three 3 friends. They're low maintence I don't see them often. We talk in sporatic bursts. I don't mean to demean their friendship. Or to put them below any other significance as they have still been there for me. But they all live n different towns and 2 went to different schools. But they never have been the type that I spent a great deal of time with and so that generally means, I'm alone to my own thoughts which after awhile becomes unhealthy on my end.  \n\nSo I transfer schools. And I was gonna hide in my room as I had done in the past. But I decided to say yes when anxiety said \"no\" and I had a blast and I made a fantastic group of 3 friends that have sense become 5. (6 total)  It was great as said above. Friday nights we go to the free movies. We'd eat dinner and lunch together. We'd hang out on saturdays and play board games. We'd go to the coffee shop and study. We'd just do shit so often together and I loved it. I felt included and I felt valued and I felt connected.\n\nNow coming this semester new schedules, right? YEP.\n\nI have 2 things on my plate my 4 classes and my club that meets once a week after dinner. (where luckily I've made friends aswell but its new to me and I'm not a knot in the ball of yard yet)\n\nThey have 4-5 things on their plates.\n\nOne has student-teacher- type thing and a job on Saturdays , an ambassador program and her classes.\n\nOne works every dinner shift now (The only meals I can attend) orchestra right after. She's signed up for clubs ... many of them too. Essentially she goes class-dinner shift-orchestra or club.\n\nOne is an engineer and has a job and often stresses over homework she must attended this job 6-9 hours a week after class. She also wants to start swimming again which would be 2-3 times a week.\n\nAnother is in photography and has long studios as I and has decided she wanted to join tennis which meats two times a week and another club with the orchestra girl.\n\nAnd there's one other girl who's major is so notorious draining and difficult she was a rare commodity last semester aswell.\n\n3 of the 5 live together. I live in a single person dorm due to traumatizingly bad roommates at my old school.\n\nAnd I understand college is get your prepped for life. I understand that the girl needs here research job, I understand the girl needs to work enough hours for money. *I understand*. I'm not mad at them.  But when they go on and they  decide to join these clubs when they're schedule is already packed I feel disheartened. While I know I should be happy for them to do stuff, I notice how it will eat in our normal routine of hanging out after dinner. I notice how it'll eat into our weekend routine of chill time together. I notice how it'll eat into our mealtimes together.  I already can't attend lunches. So I never get to see one of the girls. because she works dinner.\n\nI'm just scared, and I've expressed my fears before. I've made it clear that I want us to make time together and that I would like to try to carry on what we had last year to our best ability even if it won't be the same. But they always blow me off in a sense of \"it won't be that bad.\" OR just jokingly saying \"I'mma die this semester anyways.\"\n\nAnd maybe I'm being selfish for wanting their time. Maybe I'm being to clingy because I don't feel secure about being able to make more/new friends. BUt half of me says... they just don't care enough. I put in the sacrifices this semester to stay with them I'm spending money to be the dorms *again* as a senior. I refused to get a job over the school because I knew it'd conflict with everyone's schedule. I plan accordingly to ensure I can do my homework and have time to hang out.\n\nAnd again.\n\nThey just don't care.\n\nThey don't see the problem I see. Which is I want to maintain a strong friendship. I don't want more low maintence friends and more time to wallow in my mind.  The social distractions of last semester helped my emotional state so much.\n\nI'm just worried that by next fall, we won't be close enough and they'll get a house without me, or that I'll have to get a house without them. Or that we'd never meet and they'd just become apart of my past in a heartbeat. I just want to maintain our closeness and with three of them in a room together (I moved in at semester and they had pre-decided they were gonna live together before they knew me) I just can't help but feel or believe that unless I fight to keep something consistent going that we're gonna crumble. Because thats how it's always been for me... I make a group and generally it was never stable or crumbles within weeks and this is the first thing that hasn't fallen apart fully yet.   \n\n\nI'm sorry to seem selfish or entitled to my friends time. But ... I've never had this before. I've never ever had this before and I just really don't think I could lose this too after so many years of trying to get to this point where I could point to a group of people and say they're my friends. And I'm afraid to come across clingy or demanding if i tell them straight up how I'm feeling cause I believe it'd just make them try less as I'm \"toxic\" like my ex somewhat described me. I don't want to be toxic again either... but I can't help but want to keep something good going that I don't feel like they're even trying to see my point of view.

It may seem immature that I'm coming to Reddit of all places for help, but I really wanted opinions that didn't come from people who directly know the friend in question and therefore would get a tainted image of her.\n\nBasically, my best friend doesn't really do a lot to check up on me without me suggesting something is wrong. I never really get a \"how are you?\" as either a starter or a return in a conversation on typical days, and I'll only get some kind of inquiry if I've made it clear that something is seriously wrong on my end.\n\nFor some context, her and I go to separate schools, and she's a year behind me. We live about 30 minutes away, but see each other very often (in fact, I just came back from hanging with her for the last two days).\n\nI started noticing the issue in the middle of last week. The entire reason I even noticed her lack of checking in is because of an incident that occurred a few days ago. \n\nFor a while now, I've had a crush on one of my good friends at school, and I had my best friend and two other friends helping me try to sort out my feelings about her. Part of that assistance was creating a group chat where those three would teach me their ways of how to catch my crush's attention and see if she possibly liked me back. In doing this, I got very wrapped up in the whole romance bullshit that I wasn't acting normal or like a good friend to my best friend, who eventually snapped after a few days of me trying to change myself for the girl I liked.\n\nShe broke down in the chat and said she missed me a lot, she missed how I checked in on her every day and her entire week has been terrible because she's felt like something huge was missing- and that missing piece was me.\n\nAt first, I felt touched that she felt that way about me and actually cared about my efforts to be a good friend. I apologized for getting caught up in my feelings and trying to change myself, and immediately went to her privately and asked how she was and let her vent. I felt good. I felt appreciated.\n\nThen, the next day I resumed my activity of checking in on her, and I noticed that after she said how she was doing that day, she didn't return the question. I thought to myself, \"she's just stressed from the bad week she's having, give her some time.\" and went on with my day.\n\nBut then the same thing happened the next day. and the next day. and the next day. you get it, it even happened today.\n\nAnd it's not like I'm doing terribly, it's just I find it odd and a bit rude that she cherishes me doing that enough to tell me so honestly during a breakdown, but not enough to return the gesture?\n\nSo I want your guys' opinions. Should I try and get over this and stop thinking about it? Should I try and tell her myself that I'd appreciate her checking on me like I do her? and if so, how should I approach the subject? Am I a bad friend for wanting to be checked on from time to time like my best friend does?", "subreddit": "friendship"}

{"post_id": "czgc81", "created_utc": 1567573228, "title": "28m Ever since I was a kid I have gone most days without speaking to anyone", "author": "[deleted]", "self_text": "I'm 28 going to be 29 soon. I had been overweight my whole life until I was 27. 27 was when I got down to a healthy weight for the first time I lost 100 lbs since high school I'm now 170 lbs and I'm 6'1. But it was my whole life even when I was a kid - I don't ever remember being thin - I was always overweight. I was embarrassed by the way I looked. I knew how I looked. I knew I was repulsive. It was like having to go out in public with the most embarrassing horrible shirt on imaginable...and it's worse because it takes a year at least to get that shirt off. As a kid, I was bullied heavily heavily like you have no idea. Always ridiculed about my weight. And my dad would make me take my shirt off in front of the mirror and start to yell at me: \"You're fat you're fucking fat!\" He was an MP in the army before I was born. And that's the other thing I didn't have many friends in school and then at home I had to endure my dad and his anger issues. Very big anger issues. He was court ordered to take anger management classes. One of my first memories he put me on an ironing board and started to spank me I was in a crib, I was a baby, I couldn't even talk. I don't know he didn't hit me though but he did spank and it did hurt I was quite frightened of him and he could yell like you have no idea. And he was himself 300 lbs and 6'1 very intimidating for a kid. And it was always over something arbitrary. Years later I realize he was taking his frustrations out on me.\n\n\nSo I always just kept to myself. Never said much to anyone. I knew they wouldn't want to talk to me. That was ingrained in me since I was a kid. In high school, because I was taller and bigger, no one messed with me, they were quite intimidated by me. Everyone just left me alone. I made people uncomfortable. I felt like a monster. Kids would run away from me. I developed agoraphobia. My dad kicked me out. I was getting over my agoraphobia I was working but he still kicked me out. I had no place else to go besides this boarding house. I had a room to myself shared bathroom and kitchen with 13 drug addicts. A guy from the Aryan brotherhood used to knock on my door a lot wanting to recruit me. He scared the living shit out of me. I've been shot at. Had knives pulled on me. A 50 year old woman got me drunk for the first time when I was 20 and she took my virginity without me being aware of it. She started kissing me and it was so gross I told her to stop she gave me more beer and I realized eventually I was naked she was naked she was on top of me...she was a widow. I thought she was just really sad and I was naive when she invited me to her room. Terrible. Terrible. Anyways and the people I used to hang out with the first friends I made in years smoking weed and drinking and doing lsd the first friends I made since I was 13 - they were all drug addicts and low lifes. After one stole $600 from me, I stopped hanging out with them. I was humiliating myself for their amusement. Just because at the time I really wanted friends. I wanted to go to parties. Talk to people. People call my phone. I remember in high school always wanting to go places go to concerts but there'd be no one to go with. I was desperate at the time. Now I know better. I mean I saw a therapist for the first time when I was 22. She was the one who made me realize they were laughing at me, not with me. That I didn't deserve to be treated that way. It didn't even occur to me. I stopped talking to everyone again. I secluded myself for 3-4 years, doing nothing but drinking. Going weeks without speaking to a single person. Was becoming less desperate - I didn't want to be in a relationship after what happened with that 50 year old woman and I didn't want friends after I'd been betrayed like that. But I quit drinking. I lost the weight. Finished my degree. Moved states. Thought I'd make a new start. And I put myself out there again. And got myself even more hurt this time, more burned alive I am still shaken by what's happened to me out here. I want to leave. Now I'm working 5-6 days a week. 11 hour shifts. I'm so tired. I'm again going weeks without speaking to anyone. I haven't been drinking. I have been smoking weed since it's legal here. But I just want to disappear. Go away. Be far away from everyone else. I'm so disgusted by this species. I want to become nothing. I resent my parents sometimes for giving birth to me if I had a say in the matter I would not have been born. All I ever wanted was like a friend you know and like more supportive people but I have always been the only one there for me to push me through the difficult times, to push me through losing weight and getting sober and studying hard to get my degree. I was the only one there for me. I don't know. I'm so overwhelmed. This is what my life turned out to be. I am looking back on it, how little friends I had in school, no friends in high school middle school and then how I lived my 20s, I have gone most days without talking to a single person. I mean I'm still reticent especially meeting people in real life. I have such horrible suspicions, I can't trust anyone really. At that boarding house I've met murderers, rapists, pedophiles, you name it. And then out here where I am currently it's all awful the people are terrible. It's very difficult for me to trust because people have been quite awful to me there hasn't been much in terms of kindness.\n\n\nMy interests are philosophy (especially existential phenomenology like Heidegger and Michel Henry and also Lev Shestov, Unamuno, Cioran, etc), literature (Kafka, Anna Kavan, Clarice Lispector, Alejandra Pizarnik, Antonio Porchia, Kobo Abe, Yasunari Kawabata, Osamu Dazai, Comte de Lautreamont, Alberto Moravia, Rene Daumal, Roger Gilbert Lecomte, Dostoevsky, Andrei Platonov, Gellu Naum, Benjamin Fondane, Knut Hamsun, Giacomo Leopardi, Cesare Pavese, Blaise Cendrars, Georg Trakl, Thomas Bernhard, Raymond Roussel, Proust, Alfred Jarry, Henri Michaux, Baudelaire, Rimbaud, Victor Hugo, Edgar Allen Poe, Mallarme, Paul Valery - off the top of my head, there's so many I'm forgetting), musique concrete (Luigi Nono, Pierre Schaeffer, Pierre Henry, Stockhausen, Eliane Radigue, Bernard Parmegiani), other composers like Giacinto Scelsi, Sofia Gubaidulina, Penderecki, bands like Current 93, Death in June, Nurse with Wound, medieval heretical mysticism, Zen and Jodo Shinshu Buddhism, David Lynch, Jean Cocteau, and Ingmar Bergman films, and surrealism and expressionism in general.", "subreddit": "Needafriend"}

What makes a guy who stands head and shoulders taller then most people, the most unlovable man out there when assholes, liars, abusers, cheaters, narcissistic guys can get all the love they could want?\n\nDoes being old school, where having rules and standards, being chivalrous, helping others when they ask for help, or unconditionally accepting make you a weirdo. \nDoes being taller and stronger then others automatically make you a threat to be avoided because others see someone dangerous.\nDoes not having an ulterior motive, automatically make you suspicious and untrustworthy.\n\nSeems that with everything being online and digital, the idea of getting to know someone before making any assumptions has died. Since if someone who has courage being anonymous can bully or hurt someone just imagine what someone who knows themselves can do.\n\nSorry if this turned into a rant but I'm tired of the prejudice that everyone seems to place upon others because someone somewhere completely different did or said something that offended/hurt them. That person was that person, there is no other person like them on the planet. There are similar people or people who might look the same, act the same, but they are all different individuals.

I am not sensitive to any subject or dark humour so we can talk about pretty much anything, although I may not have much to say depending on topic.\n\n\u2022 I'm a big fan of rpgs like Skyrim, Witcher 3, Dark Souls, etc so if you wanna talk about lore and headcanon and stuff, always up for that although I am kinda burned out from gaming in general ( except for PUBG and some Skyrim).\n\n\u2022 I mostly watch action/thriller/horror/Marvel/DC movies. Mainly interested in movies made by Tarantino, David Fincher, Nolan, Guy Ritchie, etc. Also a fan of Game of Thrones, Breaking Bad, The Walking Dead, Vikings and Stranger things.\n\n\u2022 My other hobbies include reading, travelling and listening to music ( pop,metal,rap ) but not really feeling to do any of those thesedays... I also love nature, history and science.\n\nThat's all I can think of atm.. It would be nice if you are rather honest if we don't click instead of ghosting but hey, it happens.

{"post_id": "czq0zo", "created_utc": 1567627680, "title": "Are clingy friends equally toxic?", "author": "VegetableVacation", "self_text": "Sooooo... I haven't had the best experience in the friendship game in like the last 5 years. For some reason, I've always attracted people who have turned out to be so toxic and clingy towards me, it's mentally exhausting. At least that's the way I feel. I always grew up around friends. Since middle school, I was in a strict boarding school where I would spend almost the whole year with my friends there without any source of a technological device or social media, and only see my family once or twice a year (I guess that's why  I experienced people a little differently than others). I was used to being around friends, and was always an extrovert when it came to making new friends. Until high school, everything was well and good and I made some of my life long best friends through boarding school over the years. So close, that I consider them family at this point. Going into college, I wasn't too concerned about making friends because I've always found good people around me. Until I came to college, I realized that I was living in a completely different world free of technology, social media, and outside noise, and people, are not the same on the outside world. \n\nComing into college I made some great group of friends my freshman year, but particularly one girl got really close to me. She was from a poor financial background, and the only child of a single mom in Russia. I felt sorry for her, and maybe as an empath, I sometimes give too much of myself to make a person feel comfortable and cater to their needs, especially when they're in such a shit situation. Slowly, her complaints about her financial burdens and issues became toxic. Like, I totally understood where she came from and it's a stressful situation, but her complaints and constant nagging started bringing out a negative side to me (I've always been an easygoing, bubbly person). Don't want to get too much into her backstory, but there were some things that she lied about, and when she did have the money she never put it towards a good use, and so my sympathy for her started turning into some sort of resentment. This lasted all of freshman and sophomore year. She also borrowed a lot of money from me, and never paid me back (which IDC if it's my own money, but I didn't have a job so my parents were paying for everything). I didn't like that and when it got to a point where it was affecting my mental stability about life and relationships, I had to cut her off my life for a while. As much as I hate doing that - because in the past I've never experienced something like this, I had to do it. For myself, as selfish as it sounds. I found out she got into some trouble and left the country soon after to go to Canada, and we got in touch again and now we're long-distance \"friends who communicate enough to maintain a friendship\" kinda friends.\n\nCome summer before junior year, I lost my dad to a sudden stroke. Coming back to school was tough enough for me, but my dad had already paid for my tuition for that semester, and I had to come back for him. I struggled emotionally that entire semester, and was in a vulnerable place. I lived alone in a studio apartment and adopted a kitten as emotional support. I did have friends, but I slowly started distancing myself because all I wanted to do was cry and felt like an emotional wreck. I couldn't imagine being part of a happy occasion anymore, not for a very long time, and didn't wanna be a party-pooper. My friends kept checking in on me, but many just wanted to small-talk, and I wasn't too tolerable for that kind of conversation. I needed someone who would have deeper conversations and a different outlook on life, as mine had certainly changed after I lost my dad. Don't get me wrong, I still publicly did a very good job of acting normal when I had to. This freshman girl reaches out to me and asks to hang out for dinner with one of her other friends (I'd hung out with her previously at multiple occasions, but we weren't as close). She slowly started coming into my life more often, saying she didn't have any friends her age that understood her as I did. We started hanging out more, and she started liking one of the guys from my friends' circle, and they were hooking up for a while. Throughout this time, I also met the love of my life (also part of my friends' circle) and he's been my constant rock ever since. She really wanted a relationship from my friend, and he didn't give her that and their \"breakup\" was pretty ugly. Although, he warned me about her and said she wasn't a good person, which was the prime reason he didn't want anything to do with her. My boyfriend also felt a negative vibe from her, and asked me to keep my distance with her. I was an empath,  and just felt some kind of guilt since she'd been there for me at times, and couldn't let go of the good parts. Personally, it took me a while until I started seeing the red flags. Soon, I realized she had no friends because she was a manipulative narcissist, and someone who likes to control another person or in other words, feed on a host (in this situation, it was me). She knew when to be nice, and when not to, and it was too late because I was already rooming with her at this point. My mental health completely took a toll when I started living with her. There was no sense of personal space, constant negativity towards me and my boyfriend (she was also jealous because her's didn't work out), constant nagging about irrelevant things, and she'd also fed me a lot of bullshit about her parents saying they abused her as a kid (which was a complete lie, and quite frankly such a shitty thing to do to your parents unless you're a psychopath with no guilt or remorse). I'm quite certain she was a psychopath, and over the years had managed to push my friends away from me so she can have me all to herself. I somehow made it out alive only because of my boyfriend, who no matter what was by my side to keep me sane. It didn't end well for her and I and towards the end of our lease (we lived together for two years), we weren't even on talking terms. I think she's been the worst experience I've come across so far.\n\nI graduated from college, and when I was going through this shitty time with my roommate, I also befriended another girl (who was previously friends with my roommate but turned out to be closer to me, as it turned out she hated her too). She's still my friend, but to me, she just seems really clingy. She's a really nice person (or so I think) but at times, I have felt like she's selfish. The reason I say that is because she also is similar to my roommate, wherein she wants me to all to herself. She isn't a narc, but she is selfish. When I started looking for jobs after graduation, she insisted on living together. Which, at first - I wasn't opposed to that. As time went by, and I was temporarily living with her (just for the company, and her lease wasn't over), I realized, she was a little too clingy and it would only make it worse for our friendship. She wasn't happy for me when I told her I was looking for jobs all over the country. She felt alone, and she needed someone to constantly be with her. It was weird. However, over the summer, she met someone and when she realized I wasn't the one to be dependent upon, she became emotionally dependent on him. Which, if he was a nice guy I wouldn't even care, but he's a narcissist, and very controlling, possessive, and manipulative. As a friend, I care, and I warned her but she obviously needed someone to validate her existence, so she chose him. Now, I don't like to meddle in relationships because it usually backfires, but this one I am still concerned about. But my part was over. She's still my friend, but after many subtle hints that I cant be available for her 24/7, she has stopped becoming too clingy and is focusing that energy towards (maybe, quite likely) her man.\n\nThese are just examples of the people I have dealt with so far. Is this weird? Has this happened to anyone else? Can someone else relate and maybe provide some tips on why exactly I attract these kinds of people?", "subreddit": "FriendshipAdvice"}

My eldest, 8 years old, doesn\u2019t live with me and I have him every weekend. Something that I should be so excited for, but my wife, she isn\u2019t a fan. This makes it difficult and the levels of anxiety start shooting up as I am going to pick him up for the weekend. This is because their always seems to be an issue, whether it be his behaviour, his manners or something else. Now his manners aren\u2019t bad, but he has a limited attention span, normally while the tv is on. It\u2019s a rod that me and my ex partner made a long time ago and it hasn\u2019t been fixed. The rest of his behaviour that is so bad according to her is that sometimes he doesn\u2019t say please or thank you... He\u2019s 8... it happens. Now this is all fine, but her child, her oldest is a few years older, early teens. But he speaks to us like shit... standard teenage stuff. But this is fine and if it is brought up, all hell breaks loose.\nAnd then there\u2019s my youngest. Toddler age. He\u2019s amazing.\nA few days ago, he fell and cut his eyebrow. All good, all fine now. He\u2019s a trooper.\nBut I kept thinking that I was so glad my youngest wasn\u2019t there... because if he was, somehow the blame would be put towards him... shitty I know. But the truth. I raised this with the wife, and it became an argument.\nI now have 2 days to find a place to live as she wants me gone as she is sick of the arguments... the majority of our arguments revolve around how she speaks to my son. \nI have asked family for help, but they won\u2019t (even though my younger brother is living there and there\u2019s a room free) this would have only been for 2 weeks as I am starting my masters degree and student loans would have rolled in. \nI don\u2019t really have friends as I have concentrated on my work, I am well respected and know my industry inside out, but all friends now are work colleagues that I manage to a certain extent.\nSo I have nowhere. \nI feel like a failure as a father, as a husband, as a son and generally as a person... I don\u2019t know what to do and I can\u2019t see myself wanting to go on... I have to drive over a pretty decent sized bridge most days and I have started to get anxious when I get to it... is today going to be the day?

So my question is, should I be hiding this side of me? How should I keep this up?", "subreddit": "Needafriend"}

I'm a 21-year-old male looking for someone interested in being friends. As the title states, I'd prefer if the person had different opinions than me in matters of politics, religion, culture, or anything else. Lately, I've been getting really disillusioned by the way we talk about hot-button issues online. It seems that the different sides are living in their own worlds, and any contact between these worlds leads to a lot of anger and screaming. Or we just assume that anyone who disagrees with us is irredeemably evil, and refuse to speak to them.\n\nI don't like that. Beneath all these different opinions, we're all human, and can still make a human connection. If two people with different worldviews can become friends, we can explain to each other where we're coming from. It can clear up our misunderstandings, and hopefully we can gain a good friend along the way.\n\nMy views are pretty common on reddit. I'm progressive politically, and an atheist. I'm one of those people who enjoys talking about deep topics, so if you don't mind talking about philosophy, religion, politics, literature, psychology, and such, that would be really cool. Of course we can talk about lighter topics, but I'm mainly looking for someone to explore current events and the deep questions of life with me. And of course, I'd prefer if you disagreed with me in some way. Whether you're conservative, or communist, or Christian, or Muslim, or anything else, I'd like to hear from you. There's no opinion so extreme that I don't want to hear from it, trust me.\n\nAnd our disagreement doesn't have to be in matters of politics or religion. I happen to hate conspiracy theories, and I see a lot of conspiracy buffs on here, so maybe there's something I'm missing that you could tell me about. As for more nerdy opinions, I'm anti-Star Wars-prequels, pro-Star Wars-sequels, pro-anime, and anti-Disney-remakes. My opinion on the \"milk before or after cereal\" debate may be my most controversial of all. My stance: no milk. I eat cereal dry. I don't want to ruin my cereal by submerging it in cow juice until it turns into a soggy, bland mush, thank you very much.\n\nBut in all seriousness, I'm not really looking for a debate. I'd rather talk openly about our disagreements and our misunderstandings about the other side, and hopefully become friends in spite of our different opinions. I know the odds are stacked against me here. But I hope I can find someone who believes in communication between different sides as much as I do!

His tone changed and he started to ask if I recalled some stories about a guy he knew from his town, like them hanging out and going to parties. Now, my friend has been openly gay since we started college, but dated a girl for a few years in high school and told me this dude was a close friend of hers. Then he told the guy made advances on him a few times, and once even felt my friend up when they were right beside his girlfriend.  He told me how it was confusing and of course, a harassment, and that besides me, just his brother, sister-in-law and ex-boyfriend knew, and he didn't know why he told me that.

I always understand a bit too much about people and their emotions. This is sometimes detrimental because it seems to be a trait I can't turn off, so it's difficult to live in the moment and turn my brain off unless I go through extremes to simulate an environment where I can. On the bright side, it means I get along with a lot of people, because I understand and can empathize constantly. In short, I'm an INFJ.\n\nI enjoy video games and writing in my spare time these days, but I've been known to go on the occasional deep dive into other forms of entertainment like anime, books, or TV shows. My favorite genres are typically sci-fi and fantasy, with darker themes. \n\nI like to travel, but have been tethered to one place for a few months now and I'm not sure when I can be free again. I've visited friends and attended conventions hundreds of miles away, and really enjoy camping or going \"up north\" for little vacations. \n\nI'm soft spoken and reserved in a lot of cases, preferring to listen and learn more about people I'm talking to, but I can be quite the talker if the topic is something I'm passionate about. Sometimes I can go on odd tangents about this or that, usually later into the night. \n\nCurrently I'm tethered to Florida, but have goals of moving elsewhere when I've acquired my degree in Technical Writing and made a name for myself as a writer in the tabletop industry.  \n\n\nLastly, if you made it this far and are considering reaching out, I am definitely not as stiff as typing all this out felt.

If you're just passing through, this discord won't be ideal for you. We cannot promise you will meet girls/guys here who you will click with if that's also what you're looking for. Hopefully you're somebody who wants to make real friends, eventually meet up, talk everyday, etc. all that stuff.\n\nThe current members of the discord are from another discord, we know each other very well. What does this mean for you? Well, it means not only do we have this type of experience, but we will also do our best to connect with you. This means if you're a shy type, we don't care. Extrovert? Great, you'll fit right in. Some of us play games, some do not, this is definitely not that type of discord.\n\nSince we're talking about creating connections with people, we do expect you to be not only real, honest, but we hope that you are willing to voice as well. Why? Real connections occur when real effort is put out. Text is great, and often times we can only text, but we want to get to know you. Talking over voice is a good way to do this, and I believe that it's the only way to get really close to somebody.\n\n This discord is very small currently, you will be here at the beginning (and hopefully) for a long time. If you're looking for a very active discord, this is not that currently, though eventually it will be. If you're looking for good friends, chattin shit, banter and finding people long term to talk to, meet, etc, this is for you.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSome things about the people in here: We banter, a lot. We make dark jokes, we typically don't view things as sacred bar certain topics, we definitely expect you not to bully people, and we expect you to put actual effort in to creating connections as it's the whole point of this discord.\n\nIdeally you are: Genuine, can banter, will not disappear (if we see a lack of effort we will simply remove you.), would like to voice, not an internet personality, etc. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nplease PM me if you're interested, thanks.", "subreddit": "Needafriend"}

For context as my post was a while ago he was constantly giving me abuse (Not physical), it was always the same rinse and repeat, he'd get pissy, scream shout and swear at me. Not speak for a while then he'd apologize saying he's changed and it won't happen again. He's just text me and said he's sorry and feels stupid for driving me away and getting carried away over a video game. Bare in mind this isn't the first message like this I've gotten saying the exact same things. Now he's saying that he feels sorry for what he said and he was angry at the game not me. Now personally I think this is bullsh*t because he was fine until what I said. Which for context was 'I can't be that back' after I died. I just don't wanna forgive him immediately, but then look like a complete petty jack*ss to everyone else in college, because eventually people are gonna find out and I would not be surprised if he spreads bullsh*t over the story to make me look bad. \n\nSo long story short do I forgive someone who has frequently asked for forgiveness said they'd change then not long after started again and repeated the cycle?", "subreddit": "friendship"}

Sorry for the long read. \n\nHey everyone I'm 23m it's my birthday today im looking for some long term friends. In public I sadly don't have many friends and most of my friends are on here from Reddit. They have been so awesome and nice and I can't thank them enough.  I was hoping I can make friends with more people like that. Don't worry about those I'm already talking with I will still talk with you. Just trying to expand my friends list. \n\nI graduated from college with a degree in film mostly focusing on editing. I suffer from both anxiety and depression. It effects me a lot on day to day basis mostly depression. Some days I'm fine Some I'm not. So if I complain about being depressed please understand I can't control it and at least be sympathetic towards it.\n\nI'm somewhere on the autism spectrum. Its not as severe as other people probably. Like you wouldn't think i have It because I'm on the high functioning side of the spectrum. However my social skills are really bad which makes it difficult to make friends in real life. \n\nI can be very shy, lonely and boring person. I have a hard time making conversation so I might be boring to talk to at times. I will try my best not to. I don't have much in my life but I just recently found work sort of. The good news Is that I'm getting better but, still have tough time making conversation.\n\nIn terms of Hobbies. My favorite stuff to do is watch movies or tv shows. Some of my favorite movies are The Dark Knight, Goodfellas, Taxi Driver, Pulp Fiction, and Apocalypse Now. Some of my favorite tv shows currently are Big Little Lies, The Handmaid's Tale, Black Mirror, Stranger Things, Westworld, Rick and Morty, American Horror Story, Barry and The Marvelous Mrs Maisel. However I watch a lot of other movies and shows as well. I'm also big Fan of Star Wars, Game of Thrones, and Marvel. So feel free to give me suggestions on movies or shows to watch\n\nI love animals particularly Dogs and hamsters. Huskies are my favorite breed but I also love bulldogs. Sadly I don't have a dog or any pet but, would love one in the future. \n\nI'm a big WWE fan or at least try to watch what I can. Been watching since 2006. So if you like WWE that would be awesome. \n\nI love rock music from the 70s-90. My favorite bands are (AC/DC, Aerosmith, Bon Jovi, Def Leppard, Guns N Roses, Kiss, Metallica, and Queen). \n\nOther things I like are to learn about history, conspiracy theories/mysteries even though I don't believe most of them, Memes, and Sports (particular baseball/American football) \n\nSo yeah feel free to message me if any of these things interest you \ud83d\ude03. If you going to message me I recommend you being around my age at least 19-27. Nobody younger or older to chat with cause I feel it would be awkward lol. I can make some exceptions. \n\nImportant, don't bother sending me a message if your just going to ghost. It really hurts and I don't like doing that either to others unless we don't connect or something. Also I  don't like when a conversation fizzles out and I don't ever hear from you again. It's fine if your forgot to respond but, I usually think if it fizzles out and you never get back to me. That you don't care to talk again. \n\nDon't care what gender just want friends who share interests to talk. I have a Kik, Snapchat and, Discord but I want to keep the conversation on Reddit for now. Until we get to know each other more. I prefer the pm message box and not the chat but whatever works for you. So yeah just msg me your age, gender, and a little bit about yourself so I know you read all this lol.", "subreddit": "Needafriend"}

I've been friends with the same girl (we'll call her Beth) since I moved here. That's probably like 4/5 years or so. She's a couple years older than me and at the start we clicked almost right away, to my surprise. Over those 5 years or something, we always said a simple greeting and occasionally hung out, but it was never to the point where I'd consider her a best friend. \n\nBeth and I were never best friends during those years and we only grew close recently because *I had gone on a trip with her about a year ago*. It was spontaneous on my part and I should've known better than to just say yes. I didn't really know her well back then. During this trip was my first realization she was a **control freak**. The trip was fun and what not BUT what I didn't realize what the whole ass itinerary Beth planned out which catered to everything SHE WANTED TO DO. Mind you, we had other friends with us. The entire trip, we did everything she wanted to do and she hardly ever asked the other friends if we wanted to do something on the trip. She also got mad during the trip because she had the wrong address for a place she wanted to go and ended up storming off and leaving her other friends behind. I did my best to be patient with her because this was her first time traveling. It was tough, I gotta f-----g say. \n\nFast forward when we return home. Some months pass and I noticed there is always a weird vibe between us. One day, one sweet old day, I tell her I go to therapy for trauma I've experience which was sexual assault (putting it nicely) . I have PTSD, seasonal affective disorder, and anxiety to name some. She says, \"I'm being a *baby* about sexual assault.\" Okay. Oh. All right.  Screw me then. She also mentions she goes through a lot in her life. Like how she knows she needs therapy but doesn't go. She says she works to much and she says she's insecure. She says she has NO GOOD OR REAL FRIENDS. AHEM. Me? NO? Ok. Me telling her one of my secrets turns into her telling me about her apparently terrible life. None of her problems were that serious, it seemed like something everyone else was going through. (I'm not trying to downplay it. Having a mean customer at work is normal-- not that serious.) Whatever, not about me anymore-- about her. I comforted her and told her it was okay and that life kicks everyone's butt. \n\nA few months pass. She wants to talk to me about stuff that's been bothering her. She tells me she feels like I brag because I go to the gym and that my body is nice (her opinion). So, essentially, she said me going to the gym and taking care of myself **made her feel insecure and somehow I was doing it on purpose**? I mean, I don't go to the gym for you... I go for myself but uh ok. So, I told I wasn't going to stop doing what I love because she wouldn't do it for herself. She then tells me **I ruined the holiday because my PTSD**\\-- I got triggered one day and started crying, so I ruined her holiday. She told me to **\"suck it up\"**. Again, okay. She then says, \"You know you're pretty and sometimes that makes me feel really bad about myself.\" Most of the things she said, I wasn't sure how I was going to fix them. I couldn't change my body or face. She also said I bragged about my mom because my mom and I are close. Sometimes I tell my friends, me and my mom had a good day together because we weren't always close and it sucked, so hearing Beth say that really hurt because that wasn't my intention. She goes on to say, \"me and my mom don't communicate and you're doing it to rub it in my face.\" Okay, no? I didn't know you guys weren't close. \n\nMore was said but I couldn't remember it all. Most of the issues seemed like they were a Beth problem and it wasn't anything I could fix. I wasn't going to stop going to the gym because she didn't like it and I wasn't going to stop being close to my mom because she wasn't close to hers. \n\nI don't even think this friendship is worth keeping anymore. Any problem I have is never bad in her book, but any problem she has is so horrible that it has to overshadow mine. Should I keep her as a friend? The whole sexual assault comment was a low blow and I don't know if I can forgive that. What do you guys think?", "subreddit": "FriendshipAdvice"}

Someone with an ideal they were willing to strive for; a part of themselves they held-firm for someone special. Not because it was ordained by any external creed, internal insecurity, or lack of option, but because it was their informed-choice to do so; their way of demonstrating that future devotion. I still believe in such a person. \n\nHowever, it seems the only other people who follow a similar-model to myself are those who do so due to religious-practice (I'm agnostic), those who have issues with intimacy (been to therapists; they say that isn't the case) or those simply haven't had the opportunity to get intimate with another (I've had offers). \n\nI'm here to see if there is some sort of community for people like me, or others who might feel the same way I do (i.e. reserving physical intimacy due to non-religious values). \n\nNot really here to get into a debate; just trying to find other people like myself.

{"post_id": "d092hq", "created_utc": 1567728845, "title": "For those going through a break-up with a friend", "author": "Friendswithurmom", "self_text": "Hello world,\n\nI thought I'd share this with you all in hopes that maybe there will be some positive vibes taken from this post. Ten months ago, I ended a friendship of over 28 years with my childhood best friend. She was my rock and my sister. We met in middle school, went to high school, and even went to the same college. We spent years living in different states but when we finally lived in the same state again, I was so happy to have my best friend again. After 28 years of adventures, laughs, cries, and growing up, our friendship came to a tumultuous end when 10 months ago, something happened that shattered our friendship for good. As a result of our friendship ending, my former best friend took all of the friends that I had made and had introduced her to during our friendship with her and began doing things that we used to do. No more girls night out, movie/wine nights, group texts, or tags on social media. Instead, I had to see stories on Instagram of my former best friend going out with my other friends and tagging them in posts or photos about how they are all having such a great time and that they \"love their girl group.\" Yeah...I was that petty. \n\nThe first couple of months, I tried to just keep it to myself but my husband knew that I was butt hurt because he could see it in my face. I will admit it, it hurt like hell at first. There was a moment that I had sat in the car and just thought to myself, I could either do two things: I could continue being mopey, trolling on these girls social media to see what they are doing...or, I can just move forward with my life and be happy with what I have. I chose happiness. I chose happiness because I have so many things to look forward to in my life that were happening right before my eyes. I also took the time to realize what kind of friends I wanted in my life. While I was sad that our friendship ended, I understood and accepted that it had to end. She and I grew completely different. We were the same at one point but as we got older, we had different goals, different lifestyles, and our opinions became more different than it was similar. As I had accepted that, my ability to move forward was much easier. Life is not about to end for me and just because one friendship ended does not mean that you will never had friendships. I also realized that people will come in and out of your life and it is out of your control. What you do have control is your very own happiness. \n\nIn the last 10 months, I have been a lot happier...seriously! I think of my former bff less nowadays (occasionally, I get the dreams where she pops in my head and all I do is just cuss her ass out but maybe that's what Trazadone does to my sleep!) Everything happens for a reason and I know that my life has been a lot better since my friendship with her and the friendships I had with our social group was out of the picture. I ended up going on Bumble BFF where I met some cool girls and developed friendships with them...one of them has been really close to me and even married my husband and I a few months ago. I could have dwelled on what happened and be completely salty AF about what she's doing or where she's going with my former friends but I chose to focus on making myself better and have control over my life. I don't regret the friendship ending because had it not ended, I would not have taken the risk of interviewing and nailing an interview for the career I have always wanted, I would have never been able to pay off some of my car loans or save extra money because I no longer have to go to weekly bougie nights at restaurants just so I can be seen by people, and I would have never been able to meet the girlfriends that I have in my life now because I was so stuck on having what I had with my former social circle. \n\nTake time to heal, cry, yell, be bitter....it hurts, no lie....but be strong and get back up. Move forward and grow from what happened. Trust me, it will be better. \n\nHope this helps!", "subreddit": "Needafriend"}

Just like Art, I don\u2018t have a background in music, but I have a huge desire to create beats, which indirectly has been my passion for a long time, but I didn\u2018t realize it. For me the best part about music are beats. I have picked up a piano few months ago but havent been very serious about anything. However, I would love to express myself through music and make some bonkers songs.\n\nESPA\u00d1OL! I have been practising spanish on duolingo since the beginning of this year, but I don\u2018t have anyone to study/talk with. And since you learn best by doing, I would appreciate any se\u00f1or or se\u00f1orita to talk to. Also, hit me up if you wanna learn a new language together!\n\nSome other interests I have are cooking, spirituality and fitness. I\u2018m a guy, 21 and from germany.

She was never mean to me or making unreasonable demands, but her depression really got me down. \nShe regularly confided in me about her parents, thoughts of suicide and her physical presence would instantly drain my mood, her depression was like a physical thing in the room. It became an unequal friendship, with her venting to me and not being able to give me anything back, and as she was one of my only friends I didn\u2019t have other people to get my \u2018friend fix\u2019 from.\n\nIt\u2019s mostly due to the way I handled it and not setting boundaries, but even though she hasn\u2019t really done anything I find myself going into panic whenever she texts me, I think as a reaction to the emotional stress her depression caused me. Now even when it\u2019s a completely benign text I can sometimes take an hour or more to get back to normal.\n\nI know how ridiculous it is, but no matter how hard I try I can\u2019t seem to return my feelings to normal within a reasonable timespan. I have this urge to \u2018do something\u2019 when there\u2019s really nothing to be done.\n\nI really miss the time when seeing her and thinking of her was something that made me happy, and I want to fix it, even if it\u2019s just so I can carry on my day without being interrupted by anxiety.\nI feel like to fix this and return my feelings to normal I need an extended break from her and also to get her to see a therapist (and also probably see one myself), but I\u2019m not sure how she\u2019d take it or how to start the conversation as she only contacts me intermittently. She\u2019s seen therapists but thinks they\u2019re \u2018full of shit\u2019 and seems convinced that she\u2019s not going to get better.\nI know it\u2019s probably something we should talk about in person but I\u2019m 90% sure I\u2019d break down immediately as I have social anxiety on top of this and don\u2019t know how to confront people.

I have tried telling them not to let him in when he shows up uninvited, but they never listen. He is extremely rude, manipulative and overall an unpleasant person, but he acts all nice and charming in front of my parents so they don't suspect anything. It has gotten to the point where every time the doorbell rings, it triggers my anxiety and I'm scared of being home sometimes because I never know when he might show up.\n\nI'm very uncomfortable with confrontation, but I have tried to give him hints that I don't want him in my life anymore.

My gf of about a year comes from an extremely wealthy family and good family and is studying to be a doctor! When we first started dating she told me she liked how we both were from the same religion and we did activities. That\u2019s how I met my current gf .\n\nAnyway I met my friend Aaron at college and we hit it off right away! He helped me financially and helped me get over my bad breakup. After my lease was up with my roommates who my current gf likes I decided to move in with Aaron and his best friend joe.\n\nJoe is extremely trashy in my gf eyes because one he has necktats, high school dropout, is 35 and works at Burger King, and is abusive towards my gf and had threatened and hit her. He also threw her dog and broke his leg . So I can understand why she hates him.\n\nMy other friend Aaron isn\u2019t bad at all maybe just isn\u2019t motivated and is 30 without a degree yet. Aaron has helped me a lot\n\nMy lease is coming to an end with joe and Aaron and I decided to move in with my gf\n\nJoe moved out of state and both my gf and i are glad but The reason why I\u2019m writing this is because my gf and I just moved in together and i just found out that Aaron had a prior eviction and owes $6000 to a previous landlord and because of this doesn\u2019t qualify for his own place. He has asked me if he could stay with my gf and I for a couple months and my gf is upset!\n\nShe is upset because she feels it isn\u2019t our responsibility to help my friend Aaron because it\u2019s his fault he got evicted and she doesn\u2019t want someone who she thinks is a liability living with us.\n\nAaron is a nice guy and has helped me a lot but i can see why my gf thinks he is a loser. She told me it\u2019s because 1. He is 30 without a real job 2. Brags about getting c\u2019s and d\u2019s in classes 3. Hangs out and is associated with trashy people his friend joe and he also had a friend stay with us at our apartment for 5 months who ended up doing crack in the bathroom 4. Has two kids he can barley pay child support to 5. Spends all his free time watching anime and movies and playing video games 6. And has 6 cats\n\nBut I feel obligated to help him because he helped my financially but my gf says if he moves in she\u2019ll move out she feels me associating with people like that lowers my potential. She also said that by me hanging out with him and people like him will make me a loser by association and will ruin my reputation. She also doesn't feel safe with the idea of him living with us because of the fact he is friends with scary people.\n\nI am deeply in love with my gf and the only time we Have ever fought is now about my friend having nowhere to go because of his eviction but I also care about my friend.\n\nMy parents And other friends agree with my gf that they think Aaron is trashy but he is still my friend She told me she doesn't really care if I\u2019m still friends with with him but she Just thinks I shouldn\u2019t enable him by letting him live with us.\n\nI don\u2019t want to drop and abandon my friend but I can see why my gf wants nothing to do with him and it\u2019s killing me!\n\nIs she wrong for not wanting him to live with us? What should I do? Thanks\n\nEven my parents don\u2019t like my roommates or my other friends Don\u2019t like them either!\n\nShe never told me I can\u2019t be friends with him just that he can\u2019t move in with us!\n\nHELP", "subreddit": "FriendshipAdvice"}

There are tiny brown spots on the penis shaft now.\n\nI honestly hope to god that there's no std in me, but I wouldn't dare to assume without having a proper diagnosis first.

Anyway, hey there! I'm a Hungarian dude who's looking for some company on a boring saturday afternoon, and who's hoping that said company will evolve into a friendship! During the summer, I was finally able to step out of my shell for a bit, and attend a local rock festival - and boy oh boy did I enjoy it! Listened to some awesome bands, ate some overpriced food, made lots and lots of memories, and even got a kind of close friend circle that I haven't been of part of until now - and I love it! Made me change some of my worldview and just generally how I look at others, and now I'm writing this post exactly because of that!\n\nHere are some of my interests, hopefully you'll find some common points with us:\n\n* I'm a HUGE video game nerd, games are basically my life - I play a lot of different genres, and although I'm PC-only for now, I'd love to get my hands on a console in the very near future. My current most-played game is Rainbow 6: Siege for multiplayer and Slay the Spire for singleplayer, but I'm about to go through the Assassin's Creed games from Rogue onward in the coming days!\n* I really love anime, manga, and books! Although I haven't really watched any anime during the summer, I'm gonna start up again this semester, starting with finally finishing Golden Wind of JoJo's Bizarre Adventure, and I'm looking forward to the 4th season of My Hero Academia! Manga-wise I'm reading One Piece, Boku no Hero Academia, Nanatsu no Taizai, Enen no Shouboutai and Shingeki no Kyojin, and while I'm really only beginning to read books as a hobby, I've finished the Metro 2033 series, and the first book of the Three-Body Problem trilogy - all of which are really big favourites of mine, can't wait to continue the latter.\n* Couldn't function without listening to music for at least hours daily - my main interests are rock and metal, but I usually enjoy anything non-dubstep-or-techno. Favourite bands as of now are Gloryhammer, Beast in Black, Sabaton, Powerwolf and M\u00f6tley Cr\u00fce.\n* I'm a uni student, studying Computer Science for my 3rd year now! I'm really interested in robotics and AI, and I love anything connected to space. I love building and destroying stuff - to learn how the stuff around me works.\n\nI think this is enough for starters, if I list any more we won't have anything to talk about, hahah! Well then, I hope I caught your interest, if I did then just send me a PM/DM, and we can continue there! I'm also open to Discord and Kik, if you don't like to message on reddit. Hope to talk to you soon!", "subreddit": "Needafriend"}

We\u2019re getting annoyed.", "author": "ladypepperell", "self_text": "Preface: my friend, hubby and I have known each other since grade school. She was a bridesmaid at our wedding.  I must also tell you a bit about this friend for context. \n\nMy friend is the type who is unmotivated in life. She\u2019s the type who doesn\u2019t do the work to go after the things she wants. Her long term boyfriend dumped her for this reason. \n\nMy sister (also her friend) and I have gotten her lots of career making jobs over the years and she\u2019s botched them all. She works the same jobs recent grads work and they are 10-15 years younger than her.  She\u2019s a great gal whose had bad luck in relationships and work, not that great self esteem, and we all feel this weird need to help her. My hubby and I even paid for her vacation when in our late 20s cuz we felt bad that she couldn\u2019t afford it. \n\nShe was unemployed this summer and instead of hustling to find work (how else would she pay her rent??) she decided to \u201cchill\u201d. Her version of chilling is to act like a 20 year old. Pub crawling, drinking in excess, concerts etc. My husband and I work, and own a house with a pool. She\u2019d often ask to come over swimming during the week, even when I was extremely sick. I don\u2019t mind sharing with friends, but when it\u2019s appropriate. She has also wanted me to act like I\u2019m in my 20s with her this summer, and it comes from a good place, but I\u2019m 35, work and I\u2019m pregnant, so my mindset isn\u2019t really there. \n\nAnyway, my husband works in the music industry and as such gets free concert tickets anywhere in the city. He likes to treat my friends and will get them tickets to any concert they request\u2014doesn\u2019t matter the artist. He\u2019ll get them 1st, 2nd or 3rd row seats for free. \n\nSome of my friends (the ones who work serious jobs \u201ccoincidentally\u201d) occasionally ask him for tickets \u2014 if it\u2019s an absolutely favourite artist, or as a gift for their spouse, or to treat a family member who is visiting overseas. My own sister who is close with my husband never asks. Some of my friends don\u2019t want to bother him and buy tickets themselves. Heck I even buy tickets myself!\n\nNow this one friend, keeps asking him for tickets. She IS grateful, but we feel like it\u2019s getting to the point where it\u2019s a lot. Just this summer alone she asked for 3 tickets to Backstreet Boys, Taylor Swift, Fleetwood Mac, Elton John, and this other artist (can\u2019t remember) on top of that. The annoying part is the asking, it\u2019s that she doesn\u2019t bother to attempt to buy tickets. Just a quick text to my hubby. \n\nWe feel bad for her because she has a lot less economically than the rest of our group, but that\u2019s also her own doing.

It doesn't matter what it is, be it love, friendship, or a discord community .\"Sic Parvis Magna\" - Greatness from small beginnings. This discord intends to stay smaller (think: 30-40 people) with an emphasis on building long lasting relationships with people who are not only like-minded, but share an interest in genuinely connecting over time. If you're just passing through, this discord won't be ideal for you. We cannot promise you will meet girls/guys here who you will click with if that's also what you're looking for. Hopefully you're somebody who wants to make real friends, eventually meet up, talk everyday, etc. all that stuff. \n\nThe current members of the discord are from another discord, we know each other very well. What does this mean for you? Well, it means not only do we have this type of experience, but we will also do our best to connect with you. This means if you're a shy type, we don't care. Extrovert? Great, you'll fit right in. Some of us play games, some do not, this is definitely not that type of discord. Since we're talking about creating connections with people, we do expect you to be not only real, honest, but we hope that you are willing to voice as well. Why? Real connections occur when real effort is put out. Text is great, and often times we can only text, but we want to get to know you. Talking over voice is a good way to do this, and I believe that it's the only way to get really close to somebody.  \n\n\nThis discord is very small currently, you will be here at the beginning (and hopefully) for a long time. If you're looking for a very active discord, this is not that currently, though eventually it will be. If you're looking for good friends, chattin shit, banter and finding people long term to talk to, meet, etc, this is for you.  Some things about the people in here: We banter, a lot. We make dark jokes, we typically don't view things as sacred bar certain topics, we definitely expect you not to bully people, and we expect you to put actual effort in to creating connections as it's the whole point of this discord. Ideally you are: Genuine, can banter, will not disappear (if we see a lack of effort we will simply remove you.), would like to voice, not an internet personality, etc. \n\n  please PM me if you're interested, thanks.", "subreddit": "Needafriend"}

We've always been in consistent contact, there were barely few days we wouldn't at least talk. We've joked we're like a good old marriage.\n\nAlmost half a year ago she met a guy, two months ago they started dating. I won't go into details, as I tend to say too much, but in a nutshell - I simply felt abandoned. And it's normal to feel angry and maybe depressed for some time if your friend kicks you where it hurts most, if they make you lose all your trust. \n\nThe thing is I can't stop thinking about it and there were times so tough I thought I was going crazy, straight up mental. Every time I think it's okay, I see that her guy posted photos of them having fun together or I get to know about their great times in other ways, and I feel like screaming, the river of tears won't stop. I try concentrating on doing some activities, I meet with two other best friends, but I just can't get her out of my head. I keep asking myself whether they're together right now, having even more fun, what she's up to, I think where could we go or what could we do, even though I know it's pointless and just hurting in the end.  I'm either extremely mad or crying my eyes out, thinking I'm the worst for being this pathetic. \n\nI don't even know if it's normal to \"grieve\" over a friendship to this extent, I feel the same as people who go through break ups, but I don't get the same understanding, just receive the look of \"Are you serious? Come on...\" as if friendship wasn't as important as love. I'm kind of a person that has trouble expressing familiarity and keeping relationships, so these few I have I value like nothing else and get strongly attached. \n\nRight now I have no idea what to do. I don't want to lose this friendship because of me not being able to accept her renewed life, but each time I try I just can't control my frustration, discomfort, can't forget how she basically treated me like someone she doesn't need anymore, even though she obviously claimed that's not it. What does it matter that she says one thing, if she does something opposing it. \n\nI could reach out, but find myself miserable after. I don't reach out and feel miserable also... if not advice about what to do with that relationship, I'd still appreciate advice about how to get over it :(", "subreddit": "FriendshipAdvice"}

So my friend\u2019s friend who i got close with has been talking to me in such a rude tone. First she was super super rude to my bf and made a scene in public where she started fake crying (i know because she told me she started fake crying). Then when she wasn\u2019t getting good photos taken she latched out and said she spend so much money to go out and deserves to get good photos takes \ud83d\ude44 like ya all of us dint spend any money ofcourse.. then the other day i went out after such a long time thought it will be a nice night out with my girls and she had to make a bitchy comment how i don\u2019t know how to text and something else.. oh where her souvenir was.. since i forgot to bring it . I went home pretty mad but stayed calm and still was sweet to her and msged her sweetly and said hey did u reach home. She replied again in her bitchy tone. Recently now her birthday is literally 3 months away and i get msg ya i am booked\nup for all these weeks so i am only free this weekend and another weekend. I replied saying hey i am working the first weekend but i can switch my shift maybe. But let me check my schedule orginally i had keot the second weekend free. But i did say let me check my schedule what does that mean? that means let me get back to you. In the mean time other friends reply and say they are free on the second weekend. N i saw\nlater n said i can do first weekend bcz i checked my school schedule and i have an assignment and presentation n day later\nand my group members will probably\nwant to meet up day before presentation. Then i get bitchy response in the group first u said u were free now that everyone else is free you are not. I guess i will just celebrate my birthday with them. Thanks everyone. The most bitchiest reply. So i wanted to put her in her place and said first i said let me\ncheck my school schedule what does that mean it means i will get back\nto u. I am\nworking full time, in school, and planning my\nwedding. This person does not care n only\nabout her birthday that comes every year. Instead of my school if i fail i will be kicked out of the program. No fucks given about anything. So i told her please don\u2019t be rude here is my schedule so i am not making shit up. As soon as u said the first weekend i posted on my work group if someone can take my shift. And i was going to suggest we can do something alone and u can do something with others the other weekend. no need to be rude or impolite thanks. And then she read it and left the group chat. I honestly think that\u2019s so bitchy and after being bitchy and rude you leave the group don\u2019t even message saying hey sorry i msged rudely thing. And i can see her crying to others now and not even apologizing. But i don\u2019t want to apologize when i was the one willing to change my shift and obv can\u2019t change my school schedule", "subreddit": "friendship"}

We were casual acquaintances for a few months but became really close after some time. Things happened in our lives so we didn't chat as much but I still saw her as a close friend. Eventually we got back to chatting every day and became even closer than before. \n\nIn July she gave her notice to quit her job which she hated and wanted a fresh new start in life which also involved taking care of her mental health. I was really happy she took that decision even if it meant we were chatting less. \n\nShe never wanted to exchange any social media and I only really have one way of contacting her which makes me feel like I was just a good distraction when she needed one. \n\nAt some point during August, it became clear that chatting with me wasn't her priority anymore so I just sent something once a week to check in on her. I sent her a text just asking how she was and she replied a week later saying she was well and asked about me.

A big hugger by nature. I am going through loneliness and depression for quite some time now and would like to have someone to be friendly with and get the same in return. I dont know how they create those posts with 100s of upvotes. I can barely get 5 if thats my lucky day. But back to the situation, I feel very lonely even if surrounded by people who care or say they care. What I exactly want is just plain pure friendliness and care. I dont have many hobbies. Just reading, movies and beginner guitar. I have posted a lot and have gotten replies too. But they vanish after 1 or 2 messages. Lately I have been spiralling into depression and I guess the only cure of depression is genuine human company. I dont ghost people, unless they start to hurt.

I was in a really dark place when we became friends, and i genuinely feel i owe her my life. I'm not that affectionate of a person so i don't feel i've ever really gotten extremely close with her which i really regret. she was never really happy at school, so about a month ago, she announced she would be dropping out (which i supported of course, and she does have plans for the future), but things have changed, so now it's estimates she only has about a week left. what do i do? i just have no idea where to start or what to feel or what to even say. Is it easier to just not think about it and let it pass? I have dealt with friends leaving before, but none this close, and she isnt very active on any social media, and honestly, neither am I, so i've kinda already accepted that i'll loose touch with her.", "subreddit": "FriendshipAdvice"}

The 5 of them hang out constantly. \n\nI then expressed how I felt in the group the past couple years and she was open to listen but said it felt like I didn\u2019t consistently put in effort to hang - also true but I also live a different lifestyle than everyone.\n\nIn the end, we were on the same page. She apologized for how I found out and was going to tell me one on one. I apologized for leaving and blocking her calls and saying I wasn\u2019t going to the stag. \n\nAs well, it turned into this thing where I need to sit everyone down and have an open conversation about how the friendship has changed in the few years. Be honest, kind and open. \n\nI am nervous to tell friends how they\u2019ve hurt me. It\u2019s a vulnerable conversation. I still feel after this I will still show up but also not make any extra effort because this situation is going to happen again - I\u2019m not going to be a bridesmaid in the group so I\u2019m not going to try to be part of the group that I\u2019ll just never fully be a core member of. \nThank you everyone who took the time to respond.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nWe\u2019ve all been friends since we were five. \nThere are 7 of us in the group. \n\nI\u2019ve always been the odd duck in the group but I felt I was loved nonetheless up until a few years ago.\n\nEveryone settled down in their early 20\u2019s except me. I\u2019m just doing my own thing and doing my own adventures but I\u2019ve always been incredibly supportive of their lives.\n\nOne of the girls was my go-to girl from ages 12-20. She got married a few years ago. I wasn\u2019t a bridesmaid and she never told me why. At the time I didn\u2019t want to be dramatic so I never asked why I wasn\u2019t one. People would come up to me at the wedding and say \u2018I\u2019m surprised you\u2019re not a bridesmaid\u2019. Ouch. \n\nA few years ago, I found out that 5 of the girls have a smaller group chat that excludes me and another girl. I found out That they go for brunch together during their birthdays. And they always make big deals of each other\u2019s birthdays. \n\nThere\u2019s another girl in the group who is an outcast like me. She\u2019s angry and is pushing herself away from everyone because she feels she doesn\u2019t fit in. \n\nIve always loved my friends. I\u2019ve always considered my friends my family because I\u2019m not close with mine. For the past 3 years, though, I\u2019ve been noticing how I\u2019m an after thought. \n\nI went through a hard 2 years recently and I felt they weren\u2019t around for support like I would\u2019ve been for them.\n\n9 months ago a separate friend of mine died and I was not ok. They didn\u2019t check in. One of the girls said something rude in group chat and I left group chat after that. \n\nI started to avoid social hang outs because I felt so lonely in a group of people. I did write them all love letters not as a goodbye but I knew I was drifting away and I wanted them to know I cared about them all a lot.\n\nI put a lot of work into those friend love letters and heard back from 1 about it. \n\nIt\u2019s been hard. I always thought I was an important friend. I always thought I was a part of the group.\n\nThe last 9 months I\u2019ve distanced myself because I feel alone when I\u2019m with them. \n\nA month ago I felt sad by this distance and reached out to a friend saying how I feel I\u2019m an outcast. She was good about it and assured me everyone loves me and no one thinks I\u2019m an outcast. \n\nI told her I\u2019m going to make an effort to hang out more because I missed everyone. \n\nRecently, 2 of them are engaged. I always considered myself close with those 2 but it turns out all the girls are a bridesmaid except me. \n\nThey didn\u2019t want to tell me I wasn\u2019t a bridesmaid and avoided it and I had to bring it up at a party to find out. \n\nI put on a happy face but I think it was obvious I felt hurt. \n\nLater in the party I was chatting with one of them about her wedding. I then told her I felt sad that I never got an explanation why I wasn\u2019t a bridesmaid for our other friends wedding a few years ago. \n\nThen I asked her why she picked everyone but me and she avoided answering the question when she\u2019s usually honest. After that I left and cried.\n\nI feel I lost a family. I was never considered important. I was always an after thought when they were always my main thought. \n\nI left our Instagram chat, I deleted fb, I deleted Instagram. \n\nI know it sounds dramatic but I always push my feelings down for others and I don\u2019t want to say something is ok when I\u2019m actually really hurt by it. \n\nI\u2019m hurt. There is a bachelorette party in the states in April. More like a bridesmaids party and I\u2019m invited. I don\u2019t want to go. I\u2019m just speeding up the process of me not being part of that group anymore. \n\nTD;LR\nI realized Ive been the black sheep for 25 years. Now everyone\u2019s getting married and I\u2019m constantly not a bridesmaid.", "subreddit": "FriendshipAdvice"}

Primarily on line. Read a chapter (or the whole thing if you can't put it down lol) or watch an episode and then chat about it later. The few friends I have don't like a lot of the same things  and so I have no one to talk about them with. \n\nWith books I like what I like and stick with what I know. I used to read all the time but over the past couple years I've stopped. I still keep buying books to try and motivate myself but now I just have a bunch of books that I haven't finished, and that's if I even manage to start them at all. I read mostly paranormal/ supernatural books usually in the teen/ young adult genre. And I prefer series over stand alone books. City of bones, morganville vampires, woman of the otherworld, etc are series I have started but haven't gotten around to finish. I don't mind rereading from the start if someone is interested in reading together. \n\nWhile most of the Netflix I watch are similar to the books I read, I will and do watch a lot of other stuff too. But I'm more into fiction and don't really watch documentaries, game shows (there is wiggle room), or forensic files type shows (but I'm cool with criminal minds type shows). Other than that I'll give most shows a chance if I have someone to watch with and be able to talk about it with. (Also willing to rewatch anything I've seen before.)\n\nI'm also open to watching YouTube videos or if you can walk me through Xbox gaming online I'm willing to try (even though I kind of suck, but I might get better if I have someone to play with).\n\nThis is longer than I intended but if anyone is interested just pm me. Or if you're alone in your own interests or have other ideas that we can bond over online, I'm open to suggestions. Thank you and have a great day", "subreddit": "friendship"}

We both wanted them to get the social experience and just learn in a school setting before pre-k next year. \nHowever, we both wanted to send them on a part time schedule of Tues-Wed-Thurs 9-3. We just felt like fulltime was a drastic change and we also want to be able to spend some time with them on weekdays still, and also the cost. \nI talked to the daycare director and he said, sorry no they only do a part time schedule of mon-fri 9-12. Which to us, didn\u2019t really make sense because they are still going everyday and we just need to come right back to pick them up after only a few hours. \nI told my friend this news, and she said that she would get her husband to talk to the director. The director is my friend and also had advised me that he does not recommend part time because it just confuses the kids and fulltime is better for them to get adjusted quicker. I trust him fully, so I just let it be and enrolled him in fulltime. This was a few months ago in the summer. \n\nSo fall season started and my friend and I are talking and I said, okay I will see you next Monday. She replies, no actually we will see you Tuesday. And I ask huh? Why Tuesday? And she reveals that she is sending her son parttime tues-thurs.\nSo I am shocked. Why did she not tell me previously if she had gotten this special circumstance just for herself? If the tables were turned, I would have definitely told her. \n\nI asked the director, who is my friend, what happened I thought they didn\u2019t do that. And he said he had talked to my friend\u2019s husband and he was told that I had talked to my friend already and everything was settled and we were all aware. \n\nSo someone is lying, or a lot of miscommunication definitely happened. But in the end, I am pissed that my friend didn\u2019t mention anything to me. \n\nSo I confront her and ask her why she didn\u2019t tell me, and she is super defensive saying why does it matter. Because they are both still starting school for the first time so she thought it was the same situation. But she knew all of my reservations and I had considered her a close friend of mine; she was even my bridesmaid! She is actually known for being super obsessive about her kids and pretty controlling, to the  extent that several other friends have come to me asking me why she is like that. I always defended her. \n\nNow I just feel like she has been dishonest/inconsiderate of me, but the worst fact is that she doesn\u2019t think she did anything wrong. \n\nAm I overreacting?

She's more of a soul-sucking demon. I also think she reads threads like this so I'm a little on edge at posting this because I'm going to get very detailed and she'll know for sure this is her. This story probably gets weirder as it goes on. In advance, I'm sorry for any bad syntax or typos that I miss over. I also apologize for the length but I think the picture it paints is more clear this way.* \n\nSo she's more like a girl I met on the internet when I was 21. I was in a relationship that luckily I barely remember, but left me pretty unhappy and depressed because of how unfulfilled I was. I was premed at the time and wanted to go to medical school and admired this girl who was already in med school, who I found on a blogging site and I can't remember exactly how we connected, but we did. Fast forward, I sort of met her in person at a conference that we both went to. I can't really remember much of our early interactions because it was so long ago and depression can fog your brain but things went along well. \n\nAt some point me and the guy broke up, but I can't remember how much I shared of that experience with her. I imagine it was quite a bit because she was older than me and had experienced heartache before. She and I connected over shared sadness because of past relationships that didn't work out. Sometimes we'd talk one another out of panic attacks and extreme psychological distress. Looking back, I think this was really weird but I was young. At some point, we had a falling out over a difference of opinion on the internet. She thought I was personally attacking her because of my opinion on a subject that was generally being discussed on Twitter. Whatever, I blocked her. We didn't talk for about a year.\n\nAt some point, I felt like I was in a really good space emotionally in my life. At this time I was about 25. I was in a pretty good relationship at the time and he was big on having me reconcile with friends and even exes, to practice forgiveness. So I reconnected with her. I remember her mentioning to me that she had seen the ex I was dating when I first met her and asked about me when he saw her. I thought that was so weird because she doesn't know him and he doesn't know her either. We never had any discussions about her, as she was just some girl online. \n\nAnyway, I moved past it and was glad to have my penpal back. The only difference this time was that I realized how emotionally and spiritually draining she was. For the first time in maybe five or six years, I felt good about myself as a person. My self-esteem was so high. I was involved in so many wonderful things that I never imagined I'd be involved in. Yet every time she called me she was in a crisis. These weren't even life or death things. It was mostly involving men. I would tell her to stop talking to these men. That she was smart, pretty, too valuable to be worried about them, and other platitudes. But no matter how much I tried to encourage her to move on and focus on her own emotional health, she never listened. My boyfriend at the time told me that I had many friends who seemed to drain my spirit at the time, but I ignored him. It wasn't because it was some \"bros before hos\" type logic. I just thought that she needed my help, as well as many other friends I had at the time, and that I was the only one who could provide it.\n\nI know and recognize now that I tend to be a \"giver\" to anyone and everyone. I have recognized this pattern in myself recently (thank goodness) and I've started to work to stop doing this because it doesn't make me feel good. In hindsight, she was draining me. There were days where I had good dates, great work promotions, happy moments with friends--and her number would pop up on the phone and I'd feel absolutely drained. I felt guilty about this at the time. Very selfish that I couldn't meet her needs but she wasn't getting any better and she always had another crisis in the works. It was almost like misery followed her. Or she chased it down. I wasn't able to tell at the time.\n\nAt some point, she got fired from her residency and she claimed it was because she was depressed. But she also mentioned that one of her supervisors said she marginally passed boards and that she was underperforming. She complained about work a lot and always talked about how everyone there was evil and she hated it there. She complained about some GroupMe that she was in and how no one smart lived in the city she currently lived in. I thought that was a strange opinion because the city has four or five universities in it and three are considered prestigious. I thought it was wild that she got fired from being a physician. People kill people on the operating table and go to work the next day. Again, I ignored these things. I ignored the fact that she always seemed to be the victim in all of her stories and that the world was out to get her. I don't like questioning a Black woman's experience in the world. I know that very often, we endure a lot of abuse. But I found it strange that she never took any accountability in any of her stories. I guess, not strange enough to ask questions.\n\nShe was looking for a job at one point and I was rooting for her. She didn't want to look for more positions in medicine so she started using her MBA (she was in a dual degree program). No luck. She was on her last dime and had to move back home. I remember her saying that she needed help moving. Well, I had a friend who lived in that city who I could ask to help her and I did. I think this is when my red flags finally started to go off. My friend told me that the whole time he was helping her move, she was crying about some boy (and honestly, I can't keep up with which is which because she never gave me names). He said it was strange but clearly she's hurting and needs to vent. He said she whined and complained the entire trip and it was soul-crushing and draining. I didn't comment on it to him because I didn't want to make it seem like I knew I put him in the line of fire, or to even talk badly about her. But after that conversation, I started to be more in-tune with her behavioral patterns.\n\nWell, that boyfriend that made us reconnect and I didn't work out (good riddance) and I was single again. I was going through a breakup with someone I thought I was going to marry at the time so I wasn't feeling good about it but I wasn't distraught. I was proud of how I handled the situation, and this friend even commented on my growth which made me feel good, and made me forget about the moving situation as well. Maybe it was just a thing because after all she was having a bad time too. So I brushed it off. But later on, I noticed she continued calling me to talk about men who weren't even interested in taking a relationship with her serious at all, and it was becoming annoying. \n\nHer behavior kind of made me feel better about the way I was handling that breakup so I think that part of me kept her around because she made me feel helpful when I could have felt useless at the time. I had answers to the problems she couldn't seem to solve. I felt pity for her because I'm younger than her and she was acting like a child. I frequently forgot she was not \"my age\" or younger. She was nearing 30 at the time and I accepted she was never going to change and thought it was really sad. No matter how many times I recited affirmations to her, or gave her advice on what to do, she would always do the opposite and call me in yet another crisis. Even when my grandfather died, and when I found out that my aunt had cancer, she still called me crying about boys. Even when she called me to tell me about her friend's suicide, or when she told her her godmother died, the phone calls were always about boys. I started to find all the dumping on me bizarre and laborious but I wanted to be \"a good friend\" so I never complained out loud.\n\nI think things between us began to devolve when she found out that another guy had been interested in me. My ex and I used to travel a lot, and this guy and I traveled even more. He was a long-time friend prior to our relationship and he was the sweetest ever. I would share stories with her about the cute things he did for me. She seemed happy for me. But I also felt like her sad stories doubled down. It could have been the same consistent whining and complaining, but it just seemed so much more laborious to help her at that point. I was 28 at this point, really focused on my mental health, in a relationship where I truly felt wanted and appreciated, I had an amazing job that I enjoyed and my life was completely fine. I started to wonder if she called with her sad stories to intentionally be a killjoy. Again, this boyfriend noticed this behavior and told me I always felt so distant when I got off the phone with her. But what else am I supposed to feel when someone calls me and says that they want to crash their car into the highway but they're worried about whether or not they'll hurt anyone else. Or that they want to hang themselves but they're afraid of when someone will find their body? It was all so grim and depressing and she dumped it all on me. \n\nA story that began as a man who was in a hotel that she begged for closure to and had sex with started developing into a story of sexual assault. I'm not sure if it was the same guy really because she talked about so many of them and the stories all bled together but I was so confused about when she was assaulted. As these stories usually go, no one believed her and sided with the man. Yet for some reason, she was adamant about going on a ski trip where he and all his friends who don't like them would be. I, and another friend she met online, tried to talk her out of putting herself in this situation. I truly feel like she intentionally puts herself in situations like this to continue to be in more crises at this point. But it was just strange. \n\nShe moved to another city where I had a friend and I tried to get them to connect. I really regret this. I would ask him frequently if he texted her or called her to make sure she was alright. I told him she was very unhappy and had no friends and moved to the city for a fresh start. He had also recently moved there so I thought them forming a friendship would be perfect. He was excited off the strength that she was *my* friend. We would all be friends! I later heard that she was telling everyone that he was creepy and stalking her. I didn't realize this after our falling out though.\n\nFinally, I can talk about how we fell out and I don't think the story is going to get any closer to ending after this. So last year, we were both visiting the same city around the same time, we met up at a museum. We chatted a bit. I'm not going to lie, I was kind of nervous and talking too much about nothing. Rambling. Forgetting where I was going. Because I was excited to go on a date later that day. (Oh, by the way, I'm in a poly relationship now and it's working wonderfully. Hence the date.) She and I went to a museum (maybe two, I can't remember) and then I walked her to dinner to meet with her friend. I got stood up by that date that day (stupid idiot)! Which hurt my feelings, naturally, but I ended up connecting with another friend and my day went well anyway. I remember sharing the story of getting ditched to my ex-friend and this is where it gets weird.\n\nThe coming weeks after, she flip-flopped between tweeting about how happy she was that I was in a relationship that was working well for me, and subtweeting me about comments about how my wig was on my head like a hat (which, to be fair, it was too big for my head! I feel like she should have told me that because I told her she had lipstick on her teeth but I digress). And I started to feel like she resented me for some reason but I wasn't sure why. She constantly talked about how happy she was for me and my boyfriend on and off Twitter. She called me a few days before our falling out and asked me how I got over the previous date so quickly. I think I told her it was because I ended it at the right time. I didn't try to negotiate or continue the relationship. It just made no sense. She continued telling me about this saga with a guy I continuously told her to stop talking to. Some days she was done, some days she wasn't. I was honestly getting tired of it at this point and considered not wanting to answer the phone for her sometimes, but again, I thought she would want to hurt herself again so I continued. Because I thought revoking my advice and attention would make her spiral.\n\nI still don't understand exactly what happened, but my boyfriend tweeted me one day and told me that this friend unfollowed her. It wasn't intended to be a private conversation or anything so I don't know what the big deal was. I responded \"LMAO\" because I could see how some of his tweets can be annoying to her, or anyone. It was more a laugh that he was unfollowed by my friend than anything. He responded by asking if she was alright. From her tweets, he and anybody can easily see that she has a lot of emotional issues, so to be clear, it was a genuine question I'm sure. As I said, at this point, I was emotionally exhausted from her. And I knew she would call me to tell me that she unfollowed him, why, and that she doesn't like him. So my response was, \"I just hope this is the last I hear about it.\"\n\nNext thing I know, this becomes a screenshot on my timeline, and she tries to \"call me out\" in front of a bunch of people. She has 8 times more followers than me (nearly 1000) and tries hard to fit in with the \"popular\" tweeters. I block everybody, often, because I don't like the online attention from strangers. And I thought it was weird that she went to twitter to address me and not my phone like she does every other time under the sun. So I responded, \"Did you do this for attention?\" And added a tomato emoji to let her know it was no hard feelings but she was being irrational but I wasn't entirely upset. Then I started to get angry because I felt like she was holding that in, thinking back to the tweets I suspected were subs. I said, \"I felt like she was sitting on that for a long time\" and others agreed. \n\nI ended up calling her and asking her what was going on. She sounded so \"confused\" about what was happening or why I was upset at her behavior. I asked her why she did it, why she didn't call me if it was such an issue. Why she didn't try went to twitter to display that to everyone. I told her it was obvious she did it to get everyone's attention because she addressed me online for all to see. I didn't want to yell at her or end our friendship but I felt myself getting angry so I told her I'd call her back later. Well, not too long after, she tweeted my ex on the timeline. I felt like she was doing it to intentionally piss me off. So I blocked her.\n\nShe sent me a long essay I didn't even read, but began with calling me \"childish.\" Backtrack, she had just done this same thing to another one of her friends a few weeks ago. And for some reason, everything about her clicked. The whole being a victim all the time thing made sense. She starts things, walks into drama on purpose, then cries about it. So I was very angry and furiously called her through the night but she didn't pick up. I suspect she was even afraid to pick up. She rage tweeted about me and \"my nigga\" were \"throwing shade\" at her. She refers to my now husband as my \"nigga\" every time she brings him up. The next day, she texted me and asked if I was calling to yell at her because if so she doesn't want to talk because \"it's bad for her mental health.\" Of course, it is. Her mental health is clearly terrible. So I didn't reply to the text. I didn't ever plan to call or text her back. I just accepted that the friendship is over. Besides, that same day, I found out I was expecting. So I just let it go. Even though I could feel the anger in my body for days after.\n\nMy pregnancy was so horrible. I had the worst nerve pain for reasons the doctors still can't explain. I woke up with numb arms and numb legs daily. I was in and out of the hospital. I ended up getting a call from a girl I barely know telling me that someone else I don't know at all told her that this friend said that I was talking crap about her and I wasn't really her friend. Strange, because I never even tried to be her friend. This is the friend I said she had a falling out with before me. The strange thing is that I never tried to be that person's friend. I only interacted with her to try and reconcile the situation between her and the friend at one point. And only through DM online. We didn't call or text at all. And stranger, why was she still talking about it? For what? \n\nSo, I texted her. She started going off about how I'm a \"mean girl\" and a bully. I was so confused about this development because I have no idea what she was talking about. But I reminded her that she talks about everybody who doesn't want to be her friend anymore like this and she creates relationships with people like this repeatedly and not to add me to her delusional stories. She said that other people unfollowed her on Twitter and it was my fault and that my \"nigga\" and I were talking shit about her. I thought that was weird? Because I never told anyone to unfollow her. We never talk about her, nor did I even remember she existed because I was worried about other things. We were moving overseas, we were having a baby, we were not concerned about her. It was so strange to me.\n\nOver the months, people would send me screenshots of DMs where she was announcing to other people I only know on the internet that we weren't friends anymore like it was top news and everyone should know. I thought it was so weird. People went on about how she was trying to mimic certain things I did. Like she was trying to be in a secret competition with me. She was picking up my hobbies, copying certain selfies I'd taken and so on. These are things other people said. They could be false or true, I don't know. So I went to my timeline and started to discuss some of the strange things she's done, but I wasn't good at conveying the full message. She ended up saying I was a \"habitual liar\" and some jabs at my appearance followed by, \"if you're so happy and successful why are you bothering me?\" I thought this was WEIRD because I once again forgot she existed! This is what other people were bringing to me that she was spreading about me!\n\nI still periodically hear about her still spreading rumors. Most recently, I saw her tweeting with another friend of a friend who was discussing me and \"my nigga\" and the other girl was being weird too. I blocked her on twitter for a completely unrelated and honestly benign reason. But she was telling the ex-friend that I did it because I was so jealous of her and thought my boyfriend wanted her. First of all, he didn't even like her and unfollowed her way before I did. I blocked her because I was tired of her subject matter. We weren't sitting in bed arguing about whether or not she had a crush on someone two states away. It was just... weird. Because the ex-friend continued by saying that I \"went batshit,\" and that I'm \"psycho.\" This is what she's saying about me behind my back! That I'm \"psycho\" and \"crazy\" and I'm not sure why.\n\nHer behavior has made me delete my old social media because I constantly hear how she's still cyberstalking me through others. It's caused me to visit her timeline, where she tends to go to subtweet me behind my back. I don't really know all of the things she says about me, which is why I am so frightened of the kind of backlash I could get when I say or do anything with my life. There are also weird things like she applied to work at a Japanese pharmaceutical company when I said I was moving to Japan. It's weird and obsessive. \n\n**mid-tl;dr** (before the advice I need): An internet penpal turned on me after years of emotionally draining me and now she's spreading rumors about my character to strangers online. \n\nI have tried to mitigate all of this my blocking her entire following list so none of her followers can access my timeline. I've since learned (from former mutual followers) that she tends to message everyone in an apparent crisis, even people she has spoken to less often than me. She was even recently called out by a very popular tweeter, because she called her a bunch of negative names and she saw it. The tweeter posted screenshots of her dumping her \"situation\" on her! Similar miserable crap. And I realized that I was right to end our friendship at that moment. She does this to everyone!\n\nA year and a half later I am worried about how this will affect my future online. She is not the type to move on from things so I know she's going to continue to spread rumors about me until the day I die and it drives me crazy. I am planning on starting a YouTube channel about my passion for languages and I am so afraid that she will pop up out of nowhere trying to ruin my reputation and I have no idea how to mitigate that. How do I explain all of this? What if I make a LinkedIn and she reports me to my job? I know she is capable of doing this because she has reported her own therapist for saying things that she doesn't like before. She is a vicious person and lacks all self-awareness. She manipulates and lies to others and it's so hard to avoid her and others. It is so hard to tell who is truly my \"friend\" online anymore because of all of the seeds she's planed and it's so hard to even argue with someone who is telling everyone you are \"psycho\" to people who want to believe it. \n\nWhat am I supposed to do?", "subreddit": "FriendshipAdvice"}

They are amazing a huge part of my life.\n\nI am a Democrat. Although I had to step back from politics for awhile because I couldn't handle all the confrontation. I'm slowly trying to get back into it. Where I live I have no other friends that share my beliefs. That is very hard. I really think it played a big part in losing my friends. It was hard seeing people's true colors come out during last election.\n\nI'm an atheist. I have no problem being friends with people who aren't. I just want them to be loving nonjudgmental people. Unlike the Christians that I'm surrounded with. I'm also an ex Jehovah Witness so I'm disfellowshiped and can't have a relationship with my family like I should deserve.\n\nI'm married and I love my husband very much. He is my best friend but you still just need that friend that's not a spouse too. We love to get into TV shows. I'm a huge Days of Our Lives fan also.\n\nLove music!! Right now I'm really into new alternative. Lana del Rey,  Twenty One Pilots, Bleachers, Red Hearse, Young the Giant ,The XX and Chvrches. Love Lady Gaga. I love a variety of music.\n\nIf you are familiar with Queer Eye I'm in love with Jonathan Van Ness from the show. He's done Gay of Thrones it's hilarious. He has a podcast Getting Curious. It might sound cheesy but he's been helping me get out of my depression. I  love everything about him and I have nobody like that in the area I live.\n\nI can be a very loyal loving friend. I was just giving it to the wrong people. I would just love for someone to be a friend like I would to them.\n\nI do get down and depressed I have children with special needs and its hard. \n\nI'm also really goofy love joking around funny things so I'd like to be able to vent sometimes and you to me also. As long as we have a good balance of fun stuff too.\n\nThanks for reading DM if you'd like to chat. I have discord downloaded but idk how to use it.", "subreddit": "Needafriend"}

Basically we go to school together and we have every class together (we are in uni and in the same small program) and it seems like she only texts me when she needs something related to school, because whenever I text her she literally takes one whole ass week to reply to me. I know she's not that busy to take one whole ass week to reply to me. basically one day I mentioned to her that i'm kinda mad at her bc every time our other friend bullies me she never stands up for me or defends me etc. and how i just feel really bullied by our other friend who I will call (Regina). when i told her that she apologized to me and she said that in class when she would hang with me and regina she would ignore us on purpose so she would never really hear. whatever ....we made up we both apologized to each other and she told me she promised me she'll work towards becoming a better friend. I also mentioned to her how i tried to be there for her this summer but every time I would come try to hang with her or be there for her she would push me away ignore my texts or tell me not to come. anyways that day we made up, all was fine. that same day she reaches out to me and tells me \"hey lets make plans to do something after our finals\" I obviously said yes and so we had plans to go  to disneyland after our finals, we had already chosen the date and i venmoed paid her. for the sake of this story im going to call my friend amber.\n\nthat same weekend amber, regina and other friends  all go out to the bars and hang and I look at regina's post on snap chat and instagram, obviously im sad because amber my supposedly bestfriend didnt even invite me to go out with them. then that entire weekend amber is with our other friends which i get because they are leaving, since they already graduated and we won't see them for an entire year. again i had texted her and she doesnt reply. then that week comes up and we have 3 exams back to back. Friday comes and I tell her \"i'm so stressed because I really need to do well in this class since im not doing too great in that other class\". I get really bad anxiety and I stress out a lot, that's my personality, but anyways i thought she would tell me \"hey you got this\" or some encouraging words to make me feel more calm, but instead she texts me and said \"hey keep it down because regina and vinny are barely trying to pass the class\".\n\n\"I text her back saying vinny doesnt really care how other people are doing, he worries about himself but im sorry I wont say it out loud next time\" and now that im thinking back  at this... I was never telling my grades to the entire class i was telling my grades to her, looking for support or for someone to say hey you got this but instead shes telling me to be quiet be so and so is worried about not passing the class. i told her that in confidence because i considered her my bestfriend and i wanted support. and i get that must be stressful, but my friend amber isnt even being a friend to me. that right there is when she just really starts ticking me off. because then i start to notice little things that i thought were okay are not. so that friday i talk to her in person, keep in mind, im very emotional, having not slept because of our exams, im stressed and fueled with caffeine. I talk to her that friday night in hopes to have a heart to heart and i tell her \"i feel like our friendship has only been one sided and i feel like im the one that's giving and not receiving, i mentioned to her how im always there for her in a heartbeat but when i need her she takes a week to respond, i mention to her the regina thing again and how she bullies me and how i dont like how she just grouped me and regina into one, because regina makes me feel like she doesnt want me to hang out with them, i mentioned to her how i also always help her in school with studyguides, etc etc and how when i need help for something she tells me she doesn't know it, but yet gets an A, im just like i thought we were friends where we help eachother out. then im just trying to make plans with her and talk, basically i pour out my whole heart and feelings to her and how i care about our friendship and how i would wish she would tell me what she feels but instead she kinda just starred at me with a blank face the entire time i was talking to her, then i kinda raised my voice and said do you just not want us to be friends anymore and that's when she started crying.... she didnt really say anything to me or addressed anything about how i feel. i told her i will let you go because i know your assignment is due at 10 and it was 8, so i just wanted her to finish her assignment. then i left and she has not talked to me or texted me anything about what happened on friday.  she told me to text her that night when i got home, so i did and i said \"im home and im glad we talked. i really care about our friendship and wish you would communicate with me\". then she replies the next day saying \"good luck studying for \\_\\_\\_ class\".   basically im really confused because that friday night i told her how i feel and how i feel our friendship is not a priority to her when it is for me and its just frustrating for me because it nots fair that im giving my all when shes not, its not fair to me that it kinda feels like shes taking advantage of me because she kinda knows i'll always be there for her\"\n\nher reply really threw me off because she didn't address my feelings or anything. then i saw her the following week in person and i asked her if we are okay and she said we are good. that same day i texted her and i asked\"hey are we still going to disneyland this sunday since we already purchased the tickets?\" and she hasn't replied to me since she has not talked to me really ever since that friday other than seeing her in person the following week. now it is monday and no we didnt go to disneyland. now i just feel like shes avoiding me and ignoring my texts on purpose. what should i do? I FEEL VERY DEPRESSED and i feel like i'm losing a friend and she wont even let me talk to her to make anything better. again i just feel like i care so much when she just doesnt give a fuck about me and it really fucking sucks.... help!!!!", "subreddit": "FriendshipAdvice"}

Should I cut my bestfriend off?", "author": "psychoticsunshine", "self_text": "So I have been bestfriends with this girl (same age as me, 19F) for 4 years now. We didn't go to the same high school but we were neighbors, so we were really really close. We'd go to each other's houses at odd timings, sneak out and just do everything together. We'd tell each other everything and she even would tell me about issues she had with her childhood bff and other bestfriends of hers. \n\nThen we go off to college in different countries. Her parents force her to go to this college she doesn't want to (she drops out after a year and joins a college in a different city), so her being the free spirit she is (she has the type of personality where she tends to care about her happiness a lot and ways she can have fun in life, and she can be very spontaneous on that matter) she would date around for fun. In the beginning she'd keep me updated and we'd text regularly and stuff. \n\nThis is where it kind of gets complicated. She has another bestfriend of hers from highschool in the same city as her (lets call her T). So the one year she was in that college, she'd hang with T.\n\nMy bestfriend is also very pretty and has quite a following on instagram. We'd once done a photoshoot together and both of us posted the same photo on out instagram. One day, while randomly going through her profile because I missed her so much, I notices that the post of us was gone from her feed, meanwhile she had multiple photos on her feed with T. This really hurt me but I decided to let it go. On friendship day, she posted a bestfriend appreciation only with T and for me she posted a group picture with her other friends. \n\nThen comes in her odd behaviour. She stopped texting and we wouldn't talk unless I had to start the conversation. I would always be the one to call her first and even then she would be the one to hang up first. It got to a point where I told her about what I was feeling about her (excluding deleting our post together, i thought that would be too petty) and she replied saying that college has been hard because she's forced to go to that place by her parents etc etc and that her dorm conditions are bad and she has adjustment issues and stuff. Fine, I understood and we were normal. A week or so after my confrontation, she called me for the first time in 2 years to ask me about me. \n\nNow this year, she's joined a college she likes and I feel like she's completely forgotten about me. She didn't even tell me about her boyfriend herself, I had to ask. She got into drama in her current college and I called to ask if she's okay and we talked for a while but it felt awkward because i kept trying to force the conversation. She ended the call. Days later I texted her if she's fine and how everything is, she ignored me. I sent another message jokingly asking her to reply and she ignored that as well. She's turned off all her read receipts and last seen but on whatsapp the online status still shows. On snapchat, we have a streak of 300+ days and she only ever sends blank snaps everyday. \n\nI don't want to be too clingy so I've stopped texting her first. Maybe because all my messages on all her social media are ignored. Whenever I post a story she is among the first ones to see it. I know she's online and on her phone 24/7 but she chooses to ignore me. When we met in the summer before she went off to her new college, she'd be texting T 24/7 even when we were together.

It's me! a youngish female living abroad full of dreams and a wistful pain that only seems to show it's ugly face late at night when I have too much time to think. I have no idea where this path I am on is going, but every day it seems to matter less and less. Is this what they call being jaded? Perhaps I'm just numb. I don't think that's true though, otherwise, I would not care so much. But the moment my head hits the pillow and all the lights are dimmed I am hit by a wave of fear. I remember that I will, in fact, die one day and so will everyone I love. I think of how nothing I do matters in the end because along with the rest of this planet I will soon enough become a distant memory. But something inside tells me it does matter, is that just wishful thinking. I have no idea what happens when you die. Will I simply blink out of existence, as if I was never here at all. Or will some part of me remain. But I suppose if I'm here, I may as well try to make the best of the time I do have. Because who knows, this could be it. Speaking of which, time seems to be dragging lately. Yet it feels like there's never enough time to do anything anymore. I wake up and think that maybe today is the day things will change for me, but once again I look at the clock only to realize it's already midnight and I have done nothing but the necessary things to survive. Despite it all, I approach things with a sense of optimism and hope. At least I tell myself that I do, and for the most part, that's true. But always lurking beneath the surface is a sense of dread. Regret for all the things I didn't do. Apprehension for what tomorrow may or may not bring. I am not perfect by any stretch of the imagination and I have hurt others and have been hurt, but still, I feel like crying when I think of the people I have wronged. Does everyone beat themselves up about things like this. Will I ever find the atonement I seek. Well, it's been another quiet day, ruminating over my past and wondering what the next few months have in store for me. Will I continue to exist in this comfortable sadness, trying to keep this ember of hope alive. Will I betray my own heart for the sake of comfort. Will the ember ever grow into a flame. All I can do is hope. \n\nI fear that I may come across as bleak and serious but I baby talk my dogs like everyone else, trip over flat surfaces, and I'm usually quite silly when I'm out and about. I just love to make others smile. Especially for those who need it most.\n\nAnyways, if you got this far I applaud you. In my spare time, I like to read, usually fantasy or the classics. Reading is a wonderful escape and when I read classics I feel like I am peeking into the past. If books are any indicator it seems we have been suffering in similar ways for a long time. I'm very much into gardening, it's a good way to feel accomplished and it's a peaceful way to pass the time. Plus being out and around nature is a good way to recharge and feel inspired. I'm still in University but I'm taking a brief hiatus to travel. I enjoy anime, dancing, yoga, camping, stargazing, researching mythology, and gaming. I write almost every single day. It's mostly junk but it feels good to let it all out on paper, small stories, poems and such. I love to listen to music. I much prefer books and music over the company of others, though it can get lonely. I will listen to film scores, classical, metal, shoegaze, grunge, and jazz. I have a preference for older music but I love discovering new music. Lastly, I am a huge history buff, so if that's something you are interested in, you're in the right place. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI like long conversations, so if you want to exchange two-word replies I may not be the person for you. Now that doesn't mean I demand paragraph-long replies. But a little effort is very much appreciated. Otherwise, both my time and yours will be squandered away with a conversation that neither of us will enjoy.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf you wish to talk you can send me a message. Here are a few questions if you need an idea on what to write:\n\nIf you were an ancient deity, who would you be and why?\n\nYou're on a train and you see someone who is inexplicably fascinating to you, do you talk to them? What do you say?\n\nYou have just stumbled across a mysterious cave, from the entrance you can see a glowing light. These caves are rumored to be full of fae, but it's just a myth, right? Do you run away or go inside? \n\nWhich book has impacted you the most and why? \n\nYou have the chance to travel into a wormhole. On one hand, you could discover a new world full of many possibilities, on the other hand, you could die. What will you do? What do you think is on the other side? \n\nWhich era in history are you most fascinated by and why?\n\nThanks for reading this much too long post and I look forward to your replies.

We rotated in and out of leases as roommates depending on what jobs and school allowed, but my bestie and I were always a package deal. Time passes and most of our group went fairly traditional: graduation, \u201cgrownup jobs,\u201d marriage, kids, Golden retriever...you get the picture.\nWith the exception of myself and my most steadfast friend, our group began to dissolve as most of us blended into suburban life. Eventually, a good job pulled my best friend and her fianc\u00e9 across the state, although we made a point of having a weekend away once a month together.\nSo I met someone, though he\u2019s significantly older, and while he has kids, they\u2019re on their way out of the house, so while love has caught me at last, we aren\u2019t exactly a cookie cutter domestic pair. We love to travel, attend tons of sports and concerts, just have fun.\nWhile this relationship is developing, my bestie gets pregnant, so our weekends away taper off and eventually stop. I feel like not getting a babyshower invite should have been my first clue that things were off, but after I saw the pictures on Facebook, the date lined up with one of my vacations, so I didn\u2019t put much thought into it. Only recently did I realize that I\u2019d never gotten an invite.\nOutside of a hospital pic and name announcement, she\u2019s kept her kid off social media, so while I know it\u2019s two, and what it\u2019s called, that\u2019s about it. Gradually, since the baby\u2019s birth, the phone calls and daily texts have dried up. It used to be days between responses from her, now there\u2019s been nothing for several months.\nThis sucks, and I miss her like crazy, but having been through this several times before, I know how once real life starts, you fall off from people from your past. But recently my SO and I have decided to make things legal, so I called her, actually talked to her, and asked if she\u2019d be my maid of honor. I don\u2019t know exactly what I said, but something about how I don\u2019t want a bachelorette party, just want her to stand with me, and I also suggested that if she were open to it, her little one could be in the wedding party. She flat out shut me down, on all fronts, pretty much said they\u2019d be too busy (uh, okay...we haven\u2019t set a date yet..) the convo ended pretty quick after that, I was upset and just needed to clear my head.\nHere\u2019s the thing though. She\u2019s active as hell on Facebook. Like I see her posts more than the constant ads, lol.\nFinally I actually paid attention to what she\u2019s posting, and most of the time it\u2019s inspirational mommy stuff, where she\u2019s tagging her mommy friends, so that kind of explains why my eyes glaze over when I\u2019m seeing so much of something that doesn\u2019t pertain to my life. One post caught my eye, as she\u2019d tagged a group, not another mom, so I ventured into the group, and find it\u2019s a support group for parents of children who have a very specific and generally fatal disability. And in this group I finally see pictures of her child, and finally learn that it\u2019ll probably not live to make it to kindergarten, and I\u2019m just in shock.\nI want to be supportive, and present, and tell her that I know what her situation is, but I also feel like it\u2019s blatantly clear that while I haven\u2019t been cut out of her life, I\u2019ve definitely been moved to the perimeter.\nI don\u2019t know, is really the crux of this post. I miss my friend, but knowing now what she endures on a daily basis, I don\u2019t feel I have the right to even burden her with that. Not even sure what I\u2019m asking here.

And the day we were meeting up I just didn't eat anything, because I feel like when I eat I look disgustingly bloated, so I just didn't. We met at a bar and I was nervous so I took 2 shots before I went in. While there, I had 5 more drinks within 2 hours. I blacked out. I rarely do this, but the no eating mixed with the alcohol and quick succession got me. We hooked up that night, I stayed at his place, barely remember any of it. Well he texts me today that I got him in trouble with his roommate. I apparently walked into his roommates room at 2 am butt ass naked and woke him up. I have seriously no recollection of this. I feel so fucking embarrassed, so fucking ashamed, like such a dumbass. This guy isn't talking to me anymore, obviously. So if my self esteem wasn't low enough before, it definitely is now.

Sorry i\u2019m super sad... bummer \ud83d\ude10\n\n\nEdit: and i forgot to put a reason for my posting. Hoping to hear own words from others who have had similar experiences - how it felt for them.\nWould love to find a way to make sense of all this. Also low key wondering how to spend the entire month of October. My main two ideas are: 1. Having a party every weekend that month &amp; 2. Moving to Far North Queensland (Australia) and burying my head in a hole for the month. No current survival strategies post October have occurred to me yet so those welcome too\n\nOh god this has gotten so long. Sorry. It was an intricately woven support net, now it is a tangled web \ud83d\ude14\n \nSo my nearest and dearest pal and my other very dear pal are getting married next month. I\u2019m not invited. \n\n\u201cSo so\u201d, you may say, but the gal is a friend i\u2019ve known since i was 5. We\u2019ve been friends for years. Became best friends when we travelled europe together for 7 months which was like... 6 years ago now. We gave speeches at each others 21sts. Called each other best friends, even sisters. We\u2019re 26 now and i apparently don\u2019t cut it as close friends or family, despite her and i saying and behaving in a way that would indicate otherwise up until very recently (even then, only just curious silence and formality on her part in the last 6 months or so.)\n\nThe guy and i were in a band together. He is just a really lovely person and i consider(ed\ud83d\ude14) him a close friend too. Just one that i\u2019ve not known as long as her. He and i became good mates and i introduced the two of them. They hit it off. Shebang - they are now engaged. \n\nIt honestly never ever crossed my mind that they would get married without me there. Up until i found out about the wedding, I still considered them really close friends and could have genuinely looked my chick friend in the face and still called her my best friend in the whole world.\n\nWe\u2019re all in our mid to late twenties now and living on opposite sides of a busy expensive city. We all now work our tits and asses off to get by and for those reasons alone (i thought) we hadn\u2019t seen all that much of each other in the last couple of years. \n\nTo make matters worse, i found out about the wedding through a mutual friend who we\u2019ve only known for a couple of years. This person similarly never considered that I wouldn\u2019t be invited and just gaged the conversation like: \u201cso are you going to stay down there for the wedding?\u201d \n\nShe also literally said that she was surprised to be invited at all and wasn\u2019t really sure why she has been, which throws out the window the only explanation they\u2019ve given me for not inviting me: \u201cI\u2019m sorry we couldn\u2019t extend an invitation. It\u2019s just for close friends and family.\u201d\n\nWedding aside, it\u2019s not the wedding i\u2019m grieving for: it\u2019s the friendship. I don\u2019t know what i\u2019ve done. I don\u2019t know why they\u2019re gaslighting me and i\u2019m heartbroken that we\u2019re all of a sudden not part of each others\u2019 lives\u2019. \nI always pictured them as the friends i\u2019d be drinking wine and having barbecues with on the weekends when we were a bit older and who would have kids that called me aunty. \n\nI\u2019m confused and i wrote to them both just saying that i wanted to know what i\u2019ve done for them to not want me. They basically refused to answer. Said that I was \u201cmaking things worse for myself\u201d and should \u201cjust stop for all our sakes\u201d. I honestly was so hurt that they couldn\u2019t even acknowledge the pain that this has caused and that i\u2019m not even important enough to give a phone call or a message to, even if it was just to say \u201clook we don\u2019t enjoy your company as much as we used to. You have your thing and we have ours and it\u2019s no ones fault but we don\u2019t want to keep in touch with you anymore. Sorry.\u201d\n\nThey\u2019ve invited another friend i introduced them to (and her partner of a couple of years as well) despite the fact that they aren\u2019t nearly as close.\n\nBut wait there\u2019s more (god this is fucking pathetic)\nHer mum married my uncle. I was living with him when i got back from overseas and they were over at my/my uncles place all the time to hang out. Her mum and my uncle got together at my 21st and married a couple of years later (they\u2019ve since separated and it was nasty between my uncle and her mum but i wasn\u2019t involved and haven\u2019t discussed it with them so I can\u2019t see how it could be that.)\n\nWhile they were married though, my friends whole family moved into the house (i\u2019d moved out by then). So... it was my best girlfriend living in my old house with her mum and my uncle + her two brothers and my two cousins. Things started getting foggy then and I wondered if they\u2019d decided they didn\u2019t want to be friends anymore. This was some years ago now and I was sad thinking that but i just kept trucking along with my life then all of a sudden i got a 9 page letter in the mail from her saying \u201ci thought our friendship was more important to you than this and why have you shut me out of your life?\u201d. I was really shocked and we caught up and discussed and said we really loved each other and wanted to stay friends so we have (or did i suppose). From then on i considered that she similarly felt our friendship was really special and that we loved each other and so i basically reinvested in it and had this false sense that everything was fine... Now this.\n\nI just can\u2019t come to terms with the fact that i may have done something awful that i can\u2019t possibly think of. What if i do it again to other friends? or that i made such a huge mistake by overestimating our friendship to this extent. \n\nIt\u2019s been a really horrible, lonely mind fuck. \n\nAs that mutual friend said to me the night she asked if i was going to their wedding: \u201ci know what it feels like to think your friends are there one minute and then realise they\u2019re not.\u201d\n\nAnd now im crying again. Fuck. \n\nAnd while i\u2019m writing this, the friend i introduced them to literally sent me a message that included \u201ci was quite surprised that we were invited to be honest\u201d \ud83d\ude16\n\nMaybe one day this will be funny.

It doesn't matter what it is, be it love, friendship, or a discord community .\"Sic Parvis Magna\" - Greatness from small beginnings. This discord intends to stay smaller (think: 30-40 people) with an emphasis on building long lasting relationships with people who are not only like-minded, but share an interest in genuinely connecting over time. If you're just passing through, this discord won't be ideal for you. We cannot promise you will meet girls/guys here who you will click with if that's also what you're looking for. Hopefully you're somebody who wants to make real friends, eventually meet up, talk everyday, etc. all that stuff.\n\nThe current members of the discord are from another discord, we know each other very well. What does this mean for you? Well, it means not only do we have this type of experience, but we will also do our best to connect with you. This means if you're a shy type, we don't care. Extrovert? Great, you'll fit right in. Some of us play games, some do not, this is definitely not that type of discord.\n\nSince we're talking about creating connections with people, we do expect you to be not only real, honest, but we hope that you are willing to voice as well. Why? Real connections occur when real effort is put out. Text is great, and often times we can only text, but we want to get to know you. Talking over voice is a good way to do this, and I believe that it's the only way to get really close to somebody.\n\nThis discord is very small currently, you will be here at the beginning (and hopefully) for a long time. If you're looking for a very active discord, this is not that currently, though eventually it will be. If you're looking for good friends, chattin shit, banter and finding people long term to talk to, meet, etc, this is for you.\n\nSome things about the people in here: We banter, a lot. We make dark jokes, we typically don't view things as sacred bar certain topics, we definitely expect you not to bully people, and we expect you to put actual effort in to creating connections as it's the whole point of this discord.\n\nIdeally you are: Genuine, can banter, will not disappear (if we see a lack of effort we will simply remove you.), would like to voice, not an internet personality, etc.\n\nplease PM me if you're interested, thanks.", "subreddit": "Needafriend"}

Not the other one.\n\nThings I like doing:\n- binge watching TV shows (faves are Lucifer, brooklynn99, Sherlock, friends, CAOS, IT crowd)\n- listening to music (I listen to all genres except for mumble rap) (fave artists are Linkin Park, Gabrielle Aplin, Aquilo, Before you Exit, nothing but thieves, Faouzia, and Imagine Dragons)\n\nI'd just like to warn y'all that I can be pretty boring at times with no banter cause I'm always sad af but if you're cool with that feel fee to PM me \ud83d\ude02", "subreddit": "Needafriend"}

I am fine people to go places, or ask people if they have interest in going to a place for a meal. But no one seems to reciprocate. No one seems interested, and I'm not invited to any events, only finding out about them at the last minute on Slack. Today I went with a group on a tour, and when I wrapped, I asked them to hold on for a minute so I could run over and take a picture of a statue. The group said okay oh, so I ran over and got the snap, then looked back where I had last seen them and they were gone. Maybe just a coincidence, but once again I had to Uber by myself to have lunch by myself. I have created a couple channels on Slack to try to generate interest, but doesn't seem to be any of there. I'm very lonely, because I usually work from home anyhow. If this keeps up for the next week, I may travel throughout the area even though I paid for co-living and co-working here.

I'm writing from a phone so sorry for any spelling errors, I'll try to make this quick.\n\nSo, my bestfriend since birth (our mothers were pregnant at the same time) has always had my back, and I think she's a fantastic person. We're both 19 now, and I'm starting to become more of an adult and do things like getting my own apartment, getting a job, and going to college full time.\n\nThis time last year, we were both in the same boat starting college and moving in on our own, and we both are in long term relationships with our boyfriends. But halfway through the school year last year, she dropped out of school saying it was too much for her mentally. I wouldn't ever have a problem with this alone, but she's not working, and not spending her time doing anything else. She was only taking 3 classes, too.\n\nI get that college is not for everyone, and on top of that she has some serious mental issues, PTSD and depression, along with some serious back problems that prevent her from doing things like driving a car. However, I know for a fact that when she's not at school, all she does is lay on her couch and watch TV or play video games. Right now she's living with her boyfriend, and her mom is paying for her half of the rent. She is not earning any kind of money and not making any effort to. This causes all sorts of problems with her boyfriend, but in the end, he loves her and would do anything for her, so he doesn't mind paying for her food, etc.\n\nOn top of all of this, they have just moved into a brand new apartment about a month ago, and every time I have visited them, it has looked like a horder house. Not just boxes everywhere, but trash, all over the floors. You cannot use the kitchen, or bathrooms, or bedroom, because there is so much mess, and nobody makes an effort to clean it up. They currently have two puppies who live in the mess, though they are giving 1 away due to not being able to care for it.\n\nThough she is my best friend, for the past 2 years I have been trying to treat it as not my own problem, and to not think too much about it. But every time I think about it, it hurts me. I want to help her, and I know that her life style choices and her situation is altogether getting out of hand, and it's going to come to a head sooner or later. Also, all of this makes her depression so unbearable she doesn't get out of bed most mornings. I absolutely hate that she's having such a hard time with this while I seem to be thriving away from her, and I don't want to distance myself from her, because I love her and I always want to be there for her... But every time I try to talk to her about how to maybe get a job that doesn't require too much physical work, or anything of the sort, she always shuts the ideas down. \n\nHow can I talk to her and try to help her get out of this situation and make her life a little better? I don't want to hurt her getting or make her feel worse, I just want to get her out of the place she's in right now. I want her to be as happy as I am right now. Please help!\n\n\nTL,DR: My friend went from happy in high school to a depressed college drop out last year, can't get out of her bed.

I\u2019m always here for you, and I\u2019m always willing to watch a movie or a show or read something or listen to something, but whenever it\u2019s me asking you to do something, there\u2019s an excuse, and I can only accept \u201coh haha i cant focus\u201d so many times.\n\nI\u2019m always there if you need advice, but you never really accept my advice, and you never really return the favor when I need something.\n\nYou don\u2019t take me or my interests seriously, you dismiss my opinions and views, and it\u2019s started to hurt my feelings.\n\nThe playful insults started to sting, and it confused me a lot at first. Because \u201cBest friends are supposed to be able to insult each other\u201d, right? But then I started thinking, maybe that isn\u2019t the sort of friendship I want? Or maybe I just don\u2019t consider us close enough anymore?\n\nI\u2019m not 100% sure I\u2019ll ever know what happened.\n\nIf I changed, if you changed, if we both just grew up and grew differently.\n\n\nBut...I guess I\u2019m just trying to rip the Band-Aid off?\n\nI don\u2019t want any hard feelings or bad blood, though maybe that\u2019s inevitable with this sort of thing, I dunno.\n\nBut I guess, I\u2019ve been putting a lot of distance between the two of us, in the hope that maybe this would hurt you a little less. Or maybe I just don\u2019t want to have to send this, because it hurts me to have to say this. I\u2019ve never had to say this to anyone before, and it\u2019s really uncomfortable.\n\nBut nonetheless...I hope it doesn\u2019t hurt, because I don\u2019t wanna hurt you. You\u2019re a great person a great friend when you\u2019re with the right people.\n\nI just think that maybe you\u2019re not the right friend for me right now? Does that make sense? This is probably confusing and ramble-y and all that but...I dunno.\n\nI guess I felt I should say it, before my silent treatment goes to far. It was some sort of silly way to prevent myself from feeling the pain of...ending things? I guess?\n\nI\u2019m here if there\u2019s ever an emergency, or if you really, really need me.\n\nBut I guess for now, this is a bit of a: \u201cHey! We can still chat if there\u2019s an emergency or anything, but I\u2019d rather not hang out or talk on a regular basis!\u201d which sounds super bitchy and cruel.

TLDR will be at the end. Any and all help/advice would be appreciated, so thank you in advance!\n\nI've  been friends with this person for several years, and we still kept in  touch despite me being in different cities for school and this friend  living at home with their family. Over the years, this friendship has  evolved into a toxic relationship, one that I'm struggling to stay  involved in. This friend is struggling with depression and has been  having suicidal thoughts. For the first few years, I helped this friend  by compiling numbers of counselors, sending mental wellness lists,  suggesting seeing a doctor, long video chats, and many other things. I  told them about my own experience with mental health, hoping that even  though I'm not in their particular position, that knowing that someone  around them has been through it and made it out will be positive. A  fairly large group of friends ended up helping this person through the  ups and downs of life, which was dealing out a pretty ugly hand for this  friend.\n\nIt has been several years  and the situation has not changed - in fact, it's worse. Despite  everyone attempting to help them, the help was consistently turned down.  They went to see a counselor once, didn't like it, and refused to  attend another session despite me telling them that it may take a while  to not only get comfortable with a counselor, but also to find a  counselor that you click with. They found a job and promptly quit when  they didn't want to get out of bed. (I get that having a job with  depression is difficult, and we had advised them that getting a job  would be difficult so to maybe hold off a bit until they were more  stable). The large group of friends supporting them - myself included -  made a chatroom so that we could let each other know when said friend  was having a breakdown in order to balance out our own mental stability,  as many of us are going to school and/or have jobs. It became a sort of  hot potato. We've had to call the police on multiple occasions, a few  times due to threats of suicide (which were unfounded) and once due to  them being physically violent. They were taken to the hospital for an  overnight stay, where they pleaded to be released saying that they were  fine and they feel worse staying in the hospital. The hospital released  them in the morning, stating that there was nothing else to be done, but  with a strong recommendation that they consult their personal doctor.  They never did.\n\nThis past summer, I  set down very specific boundaries in order to protect myself. I told  them that I may take several hours to respond, depending on how busy I  am. I asked them to message me first before calling/videoing me so that I  could let them know if I was in a mental state to help them. I told  them that I was having a difficult time and couldn't immediately help  with anything immediately, and that I would need some time. I was met  with initial understanding, followed in the next few days by verbal  attacks including statements such as \"You want to see me dead\" and \"You  don't care about me. A real friend wouldn't leave me.\" I tried to keep  my boundaries as best as I could, but being verbally attacked constantly  didn't help with my own mental state. I tried telling them gently that  treating friends this way was abusive and that we (other members of the  group who were trying to help him but also set boundaries received  similar messages) didn't deserve to be treated like garbage when we've  invested so much energy into helping him. Once again, initial  understanding followed by verbal attacks.\n\nIt  had gotten to the point where I asked them to stop contacting me for a  while, as my own mental health was deteriorating for a number of reasons  (this friend along with a pile of my own problems that I've been  working through). Despite being told that they understood, I had in one  day about five missed text messages and over forty missed video calls.  They threatened to show up to my family's place and yell at me for being  a terrible friend. I told them politely but sternly that not only was I  not at my family's place, deeming that useless, but that the number of  calls I had missed was excessive and if there was an emergency to please  call 911. I explained to them that I had been busy and not looking at  my phone at all (it was on silent). I reminded them of a discussion we  had had years ago about the boy who cried wolf, and I had warned them  that if they were threatening suicide at every turn, unfortunately  people would grow to be numb to it and ignore it, as sad as that it.\n\nThey apologized and told me that it was my fault for not catering to their every need.\n\nAt  this point, I don't know how else to help them, if I even can. I worry  about them a lot, and although they barely message me anymore, I did  receive a concerning message today. I talked with members of the group  of friends and we had all received the exact same message today about  the same time. This friend also continually posts Facebook posts and  deletes them hours later, mostly about things such as \"having no  friends\" and being \"let down\".\n\nHas  anyone else had to support a friend similar to this? Is there anything  else I can do? I don't want to cut them out of my life because I really  do want them to get better and I know how it feels to be isolated, but I  also need to look after myself. I can't help someone who can't help  themselves..... any thoughts? I apologize for the length of this post,  but I wanted things to be clear. Advice would be appreciated!!! Thank  you!\n\nTLDR:  toxic friend is mentally ill, refuses to help themselves; myself and  other friends don't know how else to help and I'm seeking advice.", "subreddit": "FriendshipAdvice"}

She cancelled on me and her reason for cancelling was subpar and not really justified. I have a feeling she actually cancelled on me so that she could go to another, bigger party being held by her other friend. I was pretty crushed by this and don't know if I should still go to the homecoming dance. Basically the main reason for not going would be to make her feel bad for cancelling (sorry I know that sounds petty). And the other reason is because the idea of going to homecoming does not seem fun because it has a bad reputation for being filled with drunk sweaty kids dancing. I was mainly looking forward to hanging out with my friend before the dance, and now that I can't do that, and don't really have anyone else to be with before the dance, should I still go?", "subreddit": "FriendshipAdvice"}

I don't talk shit about anyone, I really don't like doing that, but I guess a lot of my recent social interactions leave me feeling a bit judgemental? My best friends are my boyfriend, sister, and my mother, and I do feel happy and good about myself when I socialize with my other friends. I wouldn't go as far as to say that this is a personal issue because I only judge when I sense something feels wrong. \n\nBut I think I really point out the flaws in other people\u2013\u00a0not everyone, but when I sense something is off, I really can't shake the feeling. For example, I noticed a more distant friend of mine is always trying to one-up me in conversation and I get a competitive vibe from her. Turns out she's pretty insecure about herself and looks up to me but would never say that to my face. I enjoy being with her in person so it shouldn't bother me as much as it does, but it really does piss me off? I know they say jealousy is the biggest compliment anyone can pay me but it really irks me. \n\nDo things like this matter? Not really! Do similar situations show up as patterns in my life and bother me in almost a cyclical way? Yes, there's always something similar that is bothering me. Either so-and-so is being sketchy, or a childhood friend is ignoring all my texts and efforts to keep the friendship alive... people always manage to get the best of me and my mind, which can't happen. Can anyone relate? \n\nPeople with healthy, non-judgemental friendships: How do you avoid being overly critical of others and not judging them based on their flaws?

I'm very bored of the crushing loneliness threatening to kill my soul, or worsen my writer's block. I live in California, but long-distance communication is fine.\n\n**Fascinating Facts for Future Friends:**\n\n1. I am very shy and awkward in social situations, and am a diagnosed Highly Sensitive Person. In addition, I may or may not be autistic. My psychologist says she is unable to tell. If I were, I would be around a Level 0.5 Aspie. I sometimes have trouble distinguishing humor and sarcasm from seriousness, but I understand human interaction. It's simply that I'm mortified by it, for whatever reason. **Generally, I like to be prompted in conversations, and not do the leading myself.**\n2. I'm a **very sensitive**, easily hurt **optimist**. I don't handle criticism well at all, never critique anyone else, and expect the same in return. **Part (most) of me never really grew up.**\n3. **I have an IQ of 150, but despise the sciences.** However, I do not care if *you* have the IQ of a fish. As Hemingway said, there is nothing noble in being superior to your fellow man. I don't understand why some people are convinced that the inner workings of two human minds can erect impenetrable barriers to effective companionship. Isn't diversity the reason why any of us want friends in the first place? That said...\n4. My interests are varied but relatively atypical for a 20-something Millennial in the land of wine and Kardashians. **I love animation (Japanese and Western) and Classic Hollywood**, and will only bother with modern cinema if the movie has something to do with **magic or aliens**. No wonder my acquaintances tend to be middle-aged. (There's nothing quite like being at a party discussing Errol Flynn movies with a Vietnam vet while the people your own age look at you like you're from Mars.)\n5. The level at which I cannot comprehend modern culture is almost surreal. I feel like I was born in the wrong world at the wrong time. I'm **extremely old-fashioned**. As in, I wanted to be married at 18 with a great husband and kids old-fashioned. (Alas.) I'm in love with a wonderful man, but am waiting for him to be in the right place for a relationship. **I have the patience of a saint, and can literally wait forever.** I bolded this because it also applies to any friendships I make on Reddit. I can say with confidence **I'd literally be your friend for life if we hit it off**.\n6. I am a lazily observant **Pagan**. I also follow **self-invented private religions**. I like to think the answers to life, the afterlife, etc. are things humans aren't yet clever enough to discover.\n7. **Writing** is my main passion, though I'm also an **actor and singer** trying to break in. I'm the poster girl for starving artists.\n8. My favorite authors are **Tolkien and Shakespeare, the gods of English prose.**\n9. **I like video games, but have no money** for them or their respective consoles. I just watch demos on YouTube and sigh.\n10. **Internet culture scares me in general**, which is why I'm questioning the fact that I'm clandestinely looking for friends on Reddit at 10:30 at night.\n\nThank you for reading, and if you actually made it to the end of this, I commend your spirit. Everything turns into a novel with me, and I love phrasing my internet posts with carefully-crafted narration; something that sadly doesn't work in life.\n\nFriend me, maybe?", "subreddit": "Needafriend"}

I initially went to just study as 16 year old, but after spending a few years in the States, some part of my family decided they wanted to get citizenship, which turned into a huge legal and ethical mess.  I really wanted to stay and make it work, but I really despised the means we were going through, so I decided to just leave. At that point I haven't really seen my actual parents and grand parents for good 5 years, which is a big part of my short life. So now I'm back home, been reunited with everyone, really happy to see my family being healthy and doing well. A bit depressed being in Russia, as I'm used and prefer completely different life style, but I know I can make it work here. \n\nI'm a very self content person, and really grateful for the life I have. Finally was able to afford health checks here in Russia, as they are not expensive at all, and even less so if you have some friends. Any medical stuff was completely out reach in the US, last couple of years our financial situation went downhill really fast, could barely afford to pay for food and bills, no way to cover insurance and medical expenses. So after doing those health checks, I seem to be a completely healthy young person, just a little bit overweight and lazy.\n\nI've been on a road trip already and saw about 2000km of the country, and it's such a massive and beautiful place nature wise.

Biggest advantage here is probably food and internet, both are very cheap and decent. I pay exactly 4 euro a month for my 300/300 internet.

If a friend does something for me, I always make sure to say thank you and show I\u2019m grateful for what they did. I also make sure to say please when I\u2019m asking them for something and show that I respect them. \n\nFor example, my roommate/friend messaged me and said that they needed to go to the store for something. They said \u201cif you want to drive me or let me take your car\u201d. So first of all, they know they can\u2019t drive my car, second, didn\u2019t say \u201ccan you\u201d or \u201ccould you\u201d or \u201cplease\u201d. I said yeah I can drive you.

It doesn't matter what it is, be it love, friendship, or a discord community .\"Sic Parvis Magna\" - Greatness from small beginnings. This discord intends to stay smaller (think: 30-40 people) with an emphasis on building long lasting relationships with people who are not only like-minded, but share an interest in genuinely connecting over time. If you're just passing through, this discord won't be ideal for you. We cannot promise you will meet girls/guys here who you will click with if that's also what you're looking for. Hopefully you're somebody who wants to make real friends, eventually meet up, talk everyday, etc. all that stuff.\n\nThe current members of the discord are from another discord, we know each other very well. What does this mean for you? Well, it means not only do we have this type of experience, but we will also do our best to connect with you. This means if you're a shy type, we don't care. Extrovert? Great, you'll fit right in. Some of us play games, some do not, this is definitely not that type of discord. Since we're talking about creating connections with people, we do expect you to be not only real, honest, but we hope that you are willing to voice as well. Why? Real connections occur when real effort is put out. Text is great, and often times we can only text, but we want to get to know you. Talking over voice is a good way to do this, and I believe that it's the only way to get really close to somebody.\n\nThis discord is very small currently, you will be here at the beginning (and hopefully) for a long time. If you're looking for a very active discord, this is not that currently, though eventually it will be. If you're looking for good friends, chattin shit, banter and finding people long term to talk to, meet, etc, this is for you. Some things about the people in here: We banter, a lot. We make dark jokes, we typically don't view things as sacred bar certain topics, we definitely expect you not to bully people, and we expect you to put actual effort in to creating connections as it's the whole point of this discord. Ideally you are: Genuine, can banter, will not disappear (if we see a lack of effort we will simply remove you.), would like to voice, not an internet personality, etc.\n\nplease PM me if you're interested, thanks.", "subreddit": "Needafriend"}

I'd really like to send her something for her birthday, like a package with some funny / interesting gifts (since we live in different countries) but there's a problem..\n\nSo, she never really told me her exact address. The thing is, I've never asked her, there has never been any situation that required me to know her address, so it's not like she wouldn't want to tell me, it just wasn't necessary until now.\n\nHere comes the reason why I'm posting this: I actually do know her address, because she once sent me a picture that had the street sign on it, and it literally took 20 seconds to look at street view and find the house.. I feel shitty because I'm really afraid this makes me seem like some creep, I'm really not. Honestly, she must have known that the pic shows the street name, I actually feel like it was a sign of her trusting me? I don't know.\n\nSo now I'm wondering if it's a bad idea to send her something for her birthday as a surprise. I really don't know if I should do it or not, I don't have much time left :( Again, I'm not some creep, I just want to do something creative for her birthday because of what an awesome friend she is.

Weve always had a drama free relationship, weve never even had an argument, we may disagree sometimes or be hostile but weve never had an actual argument where we didnt talk or anything of the sorts. I feel like shes always had kind of a drinking problem but I always dismissed it because were so young and people our age like to party and go out. However she drinks really heavily, in a night it's not 2-3 drinks like most people, it's a bottle of wine, several shots, mixed drinks, it's the whole 9 yards, she always gets excessively drunk and sloppy and I'm always the one she comes to when shes done something stupid and regrettable, regardless, I always do my best to support her. However she recently moved to a different town, a tourist town to be specific, which means LOTS of partying. She texts me almost every single day telling me about the night before, complaining about her job, bragging about where she lives, telling me she wnats to hook up with so and so, telling me how much she regrets fucking someone, but does it again anyways. Its seriously almost daily, she rarely asks me what's new with me, shes always talking about herself. Shes been drinking pretty much every single night since she moved (which was over a month ago) \"because that's all there is to do\" and it's just getting exhausting listening to that. I will try and change the subject and she just keeps going on and on, completely disregarding what I just said. She just finished telling me that her and her new friend were so drunk they could barely walk but they ended up driving drunk last night so they could get home \"but its okay because we were careful and we did blow so it sobered us up\" I love her but i just feel like were on completely different wave lengths, I'm just not about that life, I do drugs but like weed and mushrooms, I don't drink nearly as much as she does and everytime we hang out she wants to drink. I wanna be her friend cause I love her and all and tbh if I stop talking to her I wont have many friends left unless they're from work, and I work full time with the same people almost everyday, so quite honestly I dont wanna hang out with them on my days off. I honestly dont know if I should confront her about being an alcoholic, I feel like she wont handle that very well, or if I should just leave it.

He pretty much said that he didn't feel that he could stay in the relationship right now because he is very confused and is trying to figure out what he wants to do with his life. He also said that our plans in life don't align so he thinks it's for the best that we not be a couple anymore.\n\nHowever, we didn't really cleanly end the relationship. He kept saying he didn't want to actually break up because he sees that as not talking to each other or not seeing each other and he said that he didn't completely want me out of his life. So basically the conversation never really came to a complete close. I told him he had to make a decision and he ended up saying then maybe we should break up, but also he said he would want to talk about things again later.\n\nAt this point, I do see that it is probably for the best that we not be together as if what he said is really how he feels, that he can't see himself marrying me and he doesn't know if he even wants a relationship right now, then it is probably better that he have some time to himself. I didn't exactly say everything that I wanted to him and I feel that now that I have had time to contemplate and think about the situation I just want to be able to fully close this chapter with him and feel that talking to him one more time might be helpful.\n\nI am not looking to beg for him back; I just want to sit down with him, tell him that I support whatever decision he wants to make and most importantly, if he still wants to have a friendship or some sort of relationship that I would be open because I don't think that came across when we first talked. He said he still wanted me in his life and so do I but I was so taken by surprise that I think I went a little more on the defense than I should have.\n\nBasically what i'm asking is, should I talk to him one more time just to hash everything out and fully close this chapter?

As it is going to take some time to set up the background situation it will be a somewhat long read, fair warning.  Names used will either be changed messed around to save some face. \n\n**Background**:   So I am friends with people named A, F, and B. Some time ago A dated a girl named C, and it was going fairly well. They continued to date for roughly two years, then for some reason C cheated on A with a mutual acquaintance of theirs named K.  A found out and was rightfully  angry about the situation, but wanted to give C a second chance. They made up but  C went behind A and cheated on him again with K .  A was devastated, and completely broken over that. During A's heartache, K and C were dating   \n\n Sometime later K and C broke up, and C went to F. Now for some deeper background. Ever since C and F met they had some pretty good chemistry. It was pretty obvious that was  the case since even *I* noticed that, and I hardly notice much.  \n\nAll this happened when A was still in undergrad and in a different city. Whenever A would visit his parents in the city that he grew up in he always invite F, B, and myself.  Of the three, I was the only one that showed up, F would generally give a flimsy reason to not come and B didn't feel like playing card games unless F showed up.  That happened for some time, until F and I where in the car and I asked him why he didn't like hanging out with A.  F gave me a reason that didn't really add up ,( I didnt felt like it added up because later  I was shocked to see F and B talking to A on discord  but never wanting to hang out with him.)   but I promised that I wouldn't tell anyone because he was afraid it could  start a lot more drama and the resulting fallout would ruin a lot of friendships.  I didn't realize it at the time, but looking back,  I've grown really attracted to F, and was practically his little puppy dog.  So I felt trapped. A was still  in a really dark place, and I was afraid that telling him that F didn't to want to hang out with A anymore; might have sent him even further down a darker path since A really liked, and respected F, and B much more so than me.   A couple of years later A bounced back got hitched, and since all three were on talking terms I figured I'd let the dead bury the dead.    Meanwhile F moved in with another friend of ours named Mi. F, soon after, got official with C, and has been dating ever since.   That pretty much concludes the background info, if you've been reading this far I appreciate your extreme patience. \n\nA couple months ago when B, A, and myself were in Vegas, B slips out that F and C were dating. A gives a brief moment of shock and betrayal on his face but hides his pain quickly after.  Im really not sure what was talked about, or if they talked in further detail about  the situation but I was not involved since I left that night.  I would be very surprised if B knew very little about the situation since B and F are extremely close friends, but if I were A, and saw this post I would look at B discord' chat history with F, and have a frank discussion with Mi since he lived with F for a about a year.  I feel like in a couple days A and B are going to replace me with a different friend.  I cant exactly explain the reason but ever since that trip from Vegas A hasn't been his happier self, and has been rather professional with me instead of friendly, and I've always got the impression with B that he saw me as more of a back up friend and when other people came by I was quickly sidelined. \n\nI really appreciate any help that you can give. Thank you for you patience.\n\n**TLDR:**  I guess I'm afraid of getting replaced as a friend because of my own lack of transparency., and I was afraid of further hurting A when he was in a dark place. How should I proceed? Am overthinking this? Thank you again.", "subreddit": "FriendshipAdvice"}

I try to open up to them a lot, because in the past I have the tendency to hold back and isolate myself.

They interact with one another on social media, but when it's me posting, I get ignored. That's my main problem, I guess - I mostly get ignored.

I have been her best friend for a year and I have never thought about breaking it up neither recoiled from her feelings because I really care about her. She's still wary that I may one day leave but I assure her that it's never going to happen, ever. \n\nBut now, onto the big issue. \n\nLately, I've been occupied with studying for AS level retakes as well as taking the SAT since its my final year of school. I told her this and I said that it would not change anything in our relationship in the slightest and she can always still come to me for help. However, she has started to withdraw things from me in an effort to help me concentrate and no matter how many times I tell her that I am okay with her asking me for help and that this is only for now but she insisted that it would last for s long time. While I appreciate her concern and acknowledge the fact that I need to be a bit more independent, the last thing I want is to become worried because she's not telling me anything.\n\nShe has professional help, which I encouraged her to get, and said that she would tell her therapist and anybody else when she's experiencing troubles but never tell me in order to make me not worry (When it's the other way around). Basically, she'll still be there to support me right now but I can't support her, which really hurts me and my feelings. \n\nWhat should I do? Should I really just go all in and focus on myself or try to convince her otherwise, even if my situation is a bit stressful?\n\nTL;DR: In order to support me during my exams, my best friend is pushing me away from knowing her feelings and I'm conflicted on what to do.\n\nAny input is greatly appreciated.", "subreddit": "FriendshipAdvice"}

I made friends with a certain girl recently and shes like if you cloned me but made me smaller. We have so much in common and we have great chats. But due to me recently finding out some kind of worrying stuff (nothing too intense but enough to make me nervous)  i felt bad and told her about it and the basis of it is that she reassured me everything was fine and i kept going but she just bluntly told me it didn\u2019t matter right now and also how (because shes quite empathetic) my stress is stressing her out too.

My confusion with myself is why even though i prefer this honesty and bluntness over my past fear of people finding me annoying, i still feel bad/conflicted about how she reacted. \n\nDo any of you guys possibly know why i could be conflicted?

Growing up I either had one close friend who would come and go or no friends at all. I have a great girlfriend I've dated and known for years. I met a new pal a few years ago at work and recently he got a new job. For those 4 years we pretty much only had each other and our girlfriends. He always made comments about me being the only one that matters and how I was his best pal. We go on group dates with our girlfriends often. I guess now that he has a new job and he's meeting new people and I feel stagnant and find it hard to make close bonds with other friends I feel like our friendship won't be as close as he branches out. Anytime I had a super close friend I felt like I didn't need anybody else and I'd depend solely on that person. I know it's unhealthy but that's the way I feel. I feel like making new friends devalues my old ones. I don't want to continue to feel this way as I know it's wrong. I don't know how to change my way of thinking as alot of these feelings come from past traumas. I don't want to push my pal away or he overbearing and I don't want to distance myself either like I have before due to jealously. Does anybody else ever feel like this especially other dudes.

Just to be clear I'm not a Japanese media elitist. Now that's out of the way. A few Japanese artists I like are: The Pillows, Zutomayo, Yorushika, and King Gnu. The Pillows are my favorite. Thank You, My Twilight by The Pillows is my favorite album of all time and the song of the same name is my favorite song of all time. In English music I mostly like only a few songs from a given artist. There are some exceptions of course. I like Breakbot, Carpenter Brut, plus the first two Weezer albums. But it's mostly assorted music.\n\n**Shows**\n\nI watch English TV shows, movies, and anime. I just finished rewatching Breaking Bad for the first time since it aired and god damn. Excited for the movie. Favorite shows are Fargo S2, Mindhunter, and Westworld. I'm thinking of including Breaking Bad S4 in there. Favorite movies are Blade Runner 2049, Spider-Verse, Back to the Future (trilogy), Scott Pilgrim, The Disaster Artist and by extension The Room. The one by Tommy Wiseau, not that other one someone for some reason thought I meant that one time. Amazing theater experience. Moving on, I have quite a few favorite anime. I've seen more English TV+movies than anime but I tend to like the anime I like more than their counterparts on the other side. Some of my favorites are JoJo, Monster, FLCL, and LotGH. My absolute favorite of *any* medium would be FLCL. Not shows but I also read some manga. Favorites are Naoki Urasawa's works, JoJo, AoT, and Houseki. Plus for anyone curious, part 8 is my favorite JoJo part.\n\n**Games**\n\nI have a self-built PC, a Switch, and a 3DS. I don't have one game I play a ton every day. I pick something out of a pool of games I like whenever I'm in the mood. To state the obvious from that I'm a complete casual and shit at games. I don't have many favorite games either. I'd put Dishonored (both) and Prey up there. I love Arkane Studios. Danganronpa (main three but V3 best) and maybe VA-11 on the VN side of things. Generally I dislike sports games, MOBAs, and MMOs. Most recently I\u2019ve played Divinity: Original Sin 2. Great mechanics and side content, so-so main story. To my Switch and 3DS, I honestly forget I have them most of the time. Which is a shame because I want to play them more. I\u2019ve wanted to finish The World Ends With You. I love the music and the visuals. Especially the music. I do play Smash too but remember I\u2019m a casual and bad at games. On the 3DS I've wanted to finish Majora's Mask. I loved OoT and MM seems right up my alley. I just need to make time for it. I also enjoy pen and paper games despite that I rarely get to play them. Scheduling and all that. When I do, I\u2019m usually the game master. I've played Cyberpunk 2020 and DnD 5e. Plus Pathfinder once as a player. Even though I didn't get to fully grasp it before the campaign went on infinite hiatus, 2020 is my favorite. I had lots of fun working on a location for my campaign to take place in that.\n\n**Other**\n\nI enjoy keeping up with the news and politics, specifically American. I also like learning history.\n\nI listen to some podcasts. Beautiful Anonymous, VORW, and If I Were You currently.\n\nI\u2019m into tech hardware. Mostly PCs, but phones and servers too. I\u2019ve been trying to learn more on how hardware works as well as keep up with any new developments.\n\nI like mechanical keyboards. I have a board with Cherry MX Blues which I love. Except that the numpad is dead because I split soda on it. But besides that, my board and /r/mechanicalkeyboards are my exposure to mechs since I don\u2019t have the money to get multiple boards.\n\nI occasionally write reviews, 98% for anime. \n\n**Looking For**\n\nI don\u2019t want someone to use me just to vent their issues. I don\u2019t care about age, gender, location, or other such things. Direct message or chat me to get my Discord username, or just use chat to talk to me. I haven\u2019t been getting notifications properly for chat though, so I can\u2019t guarantee anything on responses. Primarily text chat either way. I don\u2019t and will not use any other messaging platforms. Hope to talk to you soon.\n\nP.S: I'm gonna be watching the American Democratic debate tonight so I may not respond for a few hours.", "subreddit": "Needafriend"}

She tells him he\u2019s worthless, has punched him and broken up his belongings. Accuses all his female friends of having designs on him. \n\nI told him from the start I had a bad feeling about her, she threatened to beat up someone for talking to him once. He thought it was romantic, I thought it was crazy. It\u2019s only gotten worse. \n\nI stayed out of it mostly. Unless he asked and then I gave my opinion.

Faith has always clanged to Ashly and really it\u2019s no big surprise I\u2019m not her \u201cbest\u201d friend. Which never bugged me because whatever. And faith was always an ok friend to me I have no beef. Me and Ashly are tight and super close what\u2019s there to hate. \n\nUntil faith started to say things to me and do things that started to raise some red flags. For example she\u2019d say like \u201cuh when I\u2019m Ashly maid of honor and she\u2019s mine where gonna ha e United weddings\u201d or like \u201c when me and Ashly have kids where gonna name them after each other and be there aunts\u201d. You see what I\u2019m saying? Like purposely excluding me. And if that\u2019s not enough they set up there class schedule exact (excluding me) so there together 24/7 which ok I\u2019ll make new friends in class whatever. \n\nFaith said she wanted to room with me because well Ashly couldn\u2019t. But frankly I didn\u2019t want to. Mainly because I like my own space and friend roommates can be a lot. She got super hurt. Even though I apologized a lot and explained it was not personal. But she\u2019s been after me since. She has slumber parties with Ashly without me and the one class we do have together they had a study session together even after they promised they\u2019d let me know so I could join. Then they went to the carnival without me and when I called her out she told me \u201cyou and Ashly went without me\u201d. Which back story \n\nMe and Ashly did go with another friend. However she was invited she knew the time we had a call about it but she was saying she didn\u2019t want to go. And Ashly called me saying she was picking me up because I didn\u2019t have a car. Like either way She ended up partying with her other friend. And how do plans that I never made and just showed up to signify me excluding her. \n\nAnyways all I said was \u201cyou bitches went without me ok\u201d sarcastic banter. I was like 15% hurt. But then she flipped it on me and then posted something about getting rid of toxic friends on her insta. Like! I\u2019m excluded all the time!

This has been a source of such pain for me over the years as I see my sisters, or people around me have friendships so easily. I've lost count over the times I've cried over being lonely. But I never seem to want to actually hang out with some of the potential friends, I like my own company, but feel so loney and like I need friends. catch-22. Either I had best friends growing up that I completely drifted apart from. Or in Uni I made some friends but either feel like deep down they don't like me or I actually don't even feel the want to hang out with them as I always feel I have to impress them etc.\n\nI'm 25 now and would say I have about 2-3 close friends here in the UK. I recently started a new job where I made a good friend, however the friendship deteriorated quickly and I ended up quitting my job and moving home because I felt out of place in the office and decided just to give up the job and go travelling/teach abroad.\n\nThat was 4 months ago and fast forward to now and I've saved \u00a34,000 and completed my TEFL course, ready to go travelling with my boyfriend and then settle in Taiwan to teach for a year, maybe more.\n\nHowever, yesterday I had this pang of fear. That going away for such an extended time would mean I lost any of the connections I have here in the UK. I know there is one person I could pick up where I left off with in the UK but the others will probably drop off so when I do come back to the UK again, I will be even more lonely. And as it's getting harder and harder to make close friends as I age, this may result in me being more depressed and lonely.\n\nHowever I don't know if I should just do the travelling 3 months and not teach abroad but come back to the UK so I can get back to a job and cultivate my friendships a bit more. Obviously travelling is incredible, and living abroad, but if it's going to result in me feeling even worse when I do return, is it a smart move?\n\nI know you could say I could meet even more amazing people abroad/when I'm teaching. However when I'm with m boyfriend we are very just a 1 on 1 kind of couple and don't really get a friendship group around us. I would probably have to go out of my way to spend less time with him to make the connections and would find myself just hanging out with him as it's easier. And as I've said, it's getting harder and harder to make friends as I grow up.\n\nAnyone got any advice or been in a similar position?", "subreddit": "FriendshipAdvice"}

Let\u2019s call her A. We understood each other so damn well, we always hung out and had overall an amazing time. Her family background is a little rough, with her living with her uncle and aunt due to her drug addicted mother. But this was sich an amazing friendship. \nShe started talking to another \u201eclassmates\u201c during our apprenticeship, their names are F and N. These girls were kinda quite passive aggressive towards me. A said she never liked them, but started to hang out with them and have little road trips. When I asked, she stated that she only hangs out with them because they have a car. Overall out friendship was the best. Like two pieces meant to be! \n\nBefore our final exams three years later her dog died. I called her several times and stated how I will come to her and help her etc. She refused, told me she was fine. Turns out she hung around with F and N. Two weeks before our finals we had a field trip, 5 days at Rome. We shared a room and had so much fun! Until one day when we got super drunk she snuck out and cried about her dog and life to N and F. The girls she apparently hated so much. N started to tell her, how ashamed everyone should be when they\u2019re overweight and not going to the gym. N was really mean towards other people. A started to believe her. After the field trip A started to write me less and less. It was like she was slipping away under my fingers. When she got a new dog I decided to visit her. Our finals were over and I was around town. I thought it would be amazing to hang out again! \nI turn up with some beer, she seems cold. Like really really cold towards me. We walked around with her dog and I had to hold the entire conversation. She didn\u2019t laugh one bit. She seemed so off... After two hours she tells me to leave before her uncle finds out I\u2019m here. Dunno why but her aunt and uncle loved everyone except me (according to what she told me and how many times N and F went to her house). I was devastated... I cried a lot. \n\nShe stopped talking to me altogether. Changed into a person I don\u2019t recognize at all! But damn I miss her so damn much. She hurt me a few times, but I don\u2019t care. I just want to see her again and talk to her and to be friends again! I miss her so much... It\u2019s been a year now and I still want a friendship just as we had! I don\u2019t know if I should write her again or not. I still got her number. But what if my emotions will get the best of me? What if she\u2019s mad? What if she\u2019s just not interested anymore? Should I write her?\n\nI\u2019m sorry for that mess. I\u2019m just really emotional right now, I don\u2019t know what to do.

Probably...\n\nAs you can imagine that line of work makes escapism one of my favorite pass-times. One only has to check my profile to notice I'm pretty active member of the /r/worldbuilding community. Which is where I spend a lot of time trying to develop a fantasyworld for a novel I am writing.\n\nLike almost every nerdy teenager I once had the dream to write a novel. Several months ago I stopped developing a story and started writing it.\n\nIt has been a harrowing experience and I constantly have to remind myself that first drafts are usually shit. Which in my case definitely is true.\n\nI'm seeking someone who has an interest in writing and storytelling as well. Someone who I won't bore or annoy when I go on a rant about story ideas I have, but will be honest when they are shit. Of course the quid-pro-quo is that I'd do the same for any works you may be developing.\n\nI've got a thing where I'm not really sharing my writing until it is finished, and it probably won't be finished until half my brain rots away from the stress. That being said, don't expect me to sen you huge chunks of text to review. I'm looking for someone to chat with not an editor.\n\nOther than that I'm just looking for a person who enjoys writing, the nerdy side of things whether it's Dungeons and Dragons, Doctor Who or what latest discovery NASA made.\n\nSo now let's go back to the mid-nineties and ask the age-old-question of chatrooms from a bygone era: ASL?\n\nAge? Doesn't really matter. I'm 29 which means I'm inevitably stuck in the pergatory between being young and an old bag. So I can relate to quite a bit of people.\n\nSex? I'm a straight male guy, but this isn't a search for a partner. So whatever gender or orientation you identify with: I'm open to chatting.\n\nLocation? I'm Euro based.

He ended up getting emails from all over the world!! It was very unexpected and very cool! THANK YOU SO MUCH!!! \nIt was a great time had by all. \n\nA few of you sent Amazon cards- THANK YOU! That was a big surprise. He did a Prime trial so he got free shipping; I believe he has ordered a wallet, a book, some PJs for our son, and I think a bracelet with the remnant change. He is very excited. \n\nI asked if he wanted to reply to the emails or have me say something on his behalf but he said he would reply to the emails as time allowd but he wanted me to say a quick shout out of appreciation. He's working a manual labor job and currently in a fitness contest so he's pretty tired most of the time. If you don't get a reply please know it isn't personal he's just exhausted. \n\nIt was the first time I've seen him genuinely smile in a long time. Those who shared music, THANK YOU. He was listening to so many new metal bands for hours and hours. Definitely enjoyed that. He laughed at the jokes. He was very, very impressed with everyone and we are both so grateful. \n\nThank you to everyone. You are all wonderful people and I hope you know how much joy you brought this family.

{"post_id": "d41wt4", "created_utc": 1568444397, "title": "A Stupid Crush", "author": "lamesandgigs", "self_text": "At first, I didn't consider going on Reddit to ask for advice about my current problem; but here we are.\n\nMe and my friend, who I will be calling \"Jane\", have known each other for almost 5 years, and throughout those 5 years, we've been there for each other through thick and thin. We've dealt with toxic friends together, we've dealt with familial issues together. We're always there for each other, and I'm willing to do anything for them (with some limitations.)\n\nRecently we became freshmen (and just a side-note, I apologize for the Class of 2023, as being someone who is part of that group), and began our 4-year journey to adulthood. How the system operates is that the 8th graders, from my middle school and the other middle-school, that is in the vicinity of the area, would merge to form the freshman class in the high-school I now go to.\n\nI must add that Jane and I are embarrassingly \"boy-crazy\" so, for the past few days, all our conversations had been about how attractive the boys from the other middle-school were; we were practically \"thirsting\" over them. But, eventually, we would come to crushing over one specific boy. So, me and Jane unfortunately only have Social Studies together; it is about an hour-long period, and it is the last class we have for our B-day schedule. At first, when it was freshman orientation and we were going through our A-Day and B-Day schedule, I wasn't particularly interested in any of the boys in our S.S. class, but Jane had found one of the boys from the other middle-school, cute and was gushing all over him. Being the douchebag I knew I was, I was constantly teasing her about it and also criticizing her for finding someone that quickly. But, on the other hand, I was also helping her find opportunities to be able to get acquainted with him even though classes were only about 15 minutes during orientation days.\n\nFreshman orientation only lasted for two days, Thursday and Friday. We had needed to familiarise ourselves with our schedules, the classes, and the most efficient route to get to them. Once Monday rolled in, school had officially begun. Now, fast-forward to Thursday (it is currently Saturday, as I am typing this out) which was a B-day. I went through all my classes but as time progressed, I gradually became more excited about S.S. so I could see Jane. What the teacher had planned for the class was for us to do stations, where she would place a document in several areas and we had to rotate in groups; taking turns with reading the document and answering specific questions related to it. So Jane and I were placed in different groups and this is where the boy I mentioned before, who Jane was interested in, comes into play. To make this easier for myself, I will be referring to him as \"John.\" This other student, John and I were assigned to be in Group 1 while Jane was in Group 5. As we began to work, I didn't pay much attention to both of them and rather, from across the room, I teased Jane continuously\u2014like smiling at her and nodding my head towards his direction. But after a while, when we had transitioned between three stations already and it was getting repetitious and boring, I started exchanging words between John and the other person. Initially, we shared answers to questions we had difficulty with but eventually, we started joking around and laughed at how horrible John's handwriting was. Maybe I am someone who gets \"infatuated\" too easily but I knew damn well I was catching feelings. His contagious laugh and smile\u2014everything about him just made me feel \"weird\" inside, and \"weird\" in a good way. Plus he was hilarious with his jokes and understood the fact that I was more interested offensive/dark humor. When it was the end of the class, I already knew I had a crush on him; but of course, I took into consideration of Jane and her feelings. As we left the school and made our way toward the buses, she touched upon the fact that \"John and I hit it off\", since she had seen me and him laughing. I cannot explain why I did this, but my guilty conscience had kicked in and I immediately shut down anything she was implying. After that situation, I try my best to avoid him at all costs and I currently aid Jane with gaining his attention.\n\nNow, this is where the question comes in: Was that right to do? Jane is one of my closest friends and as I stated before, I am willing to do anything for her. But is it right to give up my feelings, just for her? I understand that I might be over-thinking the dilemma but she seems to genuinely like John as well since yesterday, she wanted to have a proper conversation with him and get-to-know him; which she successfully did.  A similar predicament occurred back in 8th Grade, where one of my friends and I were interested in the same boy. And rather than being upfront with her, I kept denying my emotions until my infatuation with him had retired. I know this entire thing seems idiotic and that we're only juvenile 14-year olds but all I need is some assistance and maybe assurance. I have the desire to become closer with John and even, if the opening arises, confess my feelings for him. But what if I hurt her feelings?", "subreddit": "FriendshipAdvice"}

I\u2019m going through a lot of mixed emotions and I\u2019m feeling betrayed. \n\nI grew up in a small town, high school class of 115. Everyone knew everyone. Junior and senior year I had a girlfriend. It didn\u2019t work out but we had on and off relations in college. Then we parted ways eventually, most people and particularly close friends knew how I felt about her, she was my girl. I was hurt, and I couldn\u2019t get her back. \n\nFast forward to today, I met up with  a few of my hometown friends for drinks. In particular my best friend who I recently asked to be my best man at my wedding next year. He\u2019s always been there for me. Good dude, a great friend, good family and never did me wrong. A bit of a ball buster because he would like to put me in uncomfortable situations. Particularly with my X-girlfriend, who over the years dated other people and eventually got married and is now getting separated. So over a span of say, 16 years he always tried to \u201creignite the spark,\u201d we did grow up together so it was nice to see the gang back together, in some sense. She and I are now much more mature and very cordial with each other. No ill-will to each other at this point. \n\nSo tonight, we caught up and after the pleasantries and a little catching up, we got into relationships and how my engagement is going. We also got into my friends relationship, because he is living with someone. She drops a bomb on me that, she slept with him back in the day. It almost went over my head, as drinks were involved, but I\u2019m like wait a sec... you two... She described it as nothing, a night after us, but before she was married. Something that happened and meant nothing. I was taken by surprise because I knew a majority of my friend\u2019s conquests, but this was new information. She saw I was visibly upset. I want to say it didn\u2019t surprise me on her part because I knew 6 or 7 of her partners but to find out my Best Man kept this and hid this from me really hurt.\n\nBy the time the night was over, he was asking what\u2019s wrong, so I told him. He immediately owned up to it and said it was something he regretted. Also that it wasn\u2019t what I think it was. It meant nothing and happened years ago. \n\nNow I\u2019m 35 and getting married next year, I don\u2019t care for her. But at the time when they dabbled with each other she  held a special place in my heart, and he knew that, hence all the ballbusting over the years, but she\u2019s not the person I fell in love with. That person is long gone. I accept that. \n\nHe was extremely apologetic. But I feel very betrayed by my friend and someone who I have chosen for my best man. I\u2019m not sure what to do. Part of me wants to say, we\u2019re done. Another part is trying to understand who\u2019s at fault here. Another part is trying to forgive, because I shouldn\u2019t care at this point, but hindsight is 20/20. When I think back at the time period, he knew how I felt and put himself in a situation where you two found themselves... lonely.\n\nI\u2019m angry at her but I don\u2019t know if I can blame her, she was going through a slut phase. He on the other hand, maybe it was something that happened, but he decided to omit the truth over the years and proceeded as if we were all just casual friends while toying with the idea of reigniting the spark. All the meanwhile, keeping it hidden from me that something happened. Oh and I never asked but had my suspicions, but I continually thought he wouldn\u2019t do that to me. \n\nOverall, I\u2019m angry with him. I feel betrayed. I know it happened long ago, but knowing the mixed feelings I had at the time when their incident happened says that he knew how I felt and put himself in that situation. \n\nI\u2019m really not sure how to feel.", "subreddit": "FriendshipAdvice"}

Sam and I used to be really good friends from sophomore to senior year. We did a lot of the same extra curriculars and were in the same classes. I was always there to support them whether it was a performance or award ceremony. I helped Sam ask their crush to prom. I thought we had a good friendship. The summer after senior year however, they ghosted me. They would always make up excuses to no attend a hang out. The biggest punch in the face was when I planned a big camping trip and they wouldn\u2019t come (18th bday). \n\nSo I confronted Sam and they said that they didn\u2019t like when I teased them like calling them names and making jokes. I apologized and said that I didn\u2019t know they hadn\u2019t liked the joking around (our friend group was know for calling each other stupid names and teasing a lot). She said she still wanted to be friends after hs and I said ok.\n\nOne year into college I ask Sam to hang and they say yes and I go up to their college (college in the same state) for the weekend. Sam is nice and we talk. I thought we had repaired the relationship. We both agree to \u201cdo this again\u201d. 2 years and I don\u2019t hear a thing except when I ask about meeting up during Xmas break (Sam couldn\u2019t because they were going to another state to visit their new SO). Then this past summer I get a book of faces invite to a party at their house with people from our old friend group saying that we should all get together and meet everyone\u2019s new SOs (a bunch of us got into relationships in college). \n\nSo basically I am confused. Does Sam want a friendship with me or are we friends out of convenience. I don\u2019t really want to throw a 4 years friendship away but idk if it is worth pursuing. I understand I should have notice Sam\u2019s uncomfortableness with the teasing earlier but idk why Sam would throw away 3 years of solid friendship over that. And why would they ghost me but then hang out with me then ghost me then invite me to a party? Idk guys I\u2019m at a loss.\n\nTLDR: high school friend cut ties after high school but then we hung out once but now they are ghosting me again. But then they invited me to a party at their house to meet their SO. Should I continue to try to have a friendship with this person.", "subreddit": "FriendshipAdvice"}

So if u want read my story or don\u2019t but contact me either way :) \n\n\nSo where do I start I\u2019m 15f for reference. So let\u2019s start back when I was in grade 6 so elementary was really good for me but then when middle school hit it kind of all went to shit. Me and My \u201cbest friend\u201d at them time (and on and off after that)  made a little friend group in our class as you do. Anyways everything was alright but about at the end of the year is where I got rough. She basically turned my whole friend group against me it was 4 girls. Which ok sounds shitty but that\u2019s not even the worst part. \n\nI don\u2019t know if any of you know what a sports day is but it\u2019s something we have in Canada, anyways so at the sports day our whole class went anyways so she then turned almost my whole class again me. It was just me and this one girl (she was part of our friend group).  Anyways so the whole class was on one side of the bleachers and me and this one girl where on the other (I can\u2019t remember if there was anyone else I think there was but idk). Anyways so the whole class was just laughing and snickering at me the whole day. And I didn\u2019t do anything to this girl I was just her \u201cfriend and that was it\u201d. So after that year I went into home schooling it was full time except for 2 hr classes twice a week. And so over that year I developed major what I think is social anxiety or something like it. It almost came to the point where I couldn\u2019t even walk by a group of girls or anyone who looked like they where in there teens. And in grade 8 I entered this program in the school where it was 2 full school days a week and I was ok at that but it was just kind of like grade 7  but the 2 days a week thing helped my anxiety cause I was with kids my age. oh and I also lost my Athletic ability in that time. But I started to go to the gym and now I can go 45 min on the elliptical now. But that\u2019s besides the point. Oh and in grade 8 and 9 my grades when from almost straight A\u2019s to cs and bs.\n\nWe didn\u2019t reconnect until grade 9 where we were actually really good (just one on one) no drama or anything like that because it was just us so what could really happen. But she told me that this program (that I was still in) was lame and that I shouldn\u2019t care and to Judy come to here school. (Or that\u2019s how I felt like I had to act around her) but I realized that it was a really good thing for me and grade 9 even tho my grades where bad it was still an ok year. And my anxiety was doing better to as I made myself go out and be with people so I forced myself to get exposure. \n\n  But then grade 10 hit when my mom sent me to the high school that she was at.  She made me think that I would just be part of her friend group without any trouble at all. And so I believed her. But then not 2 days into me going there she started to act distant and then I asked her if we where ok and she said yea we where bit that I should basically fuck off and find a new friend group. So I went back to home schooling not 1 week after entering my school. So now I\u2019m here trying to get my grades back up. I feel like I\u2019m at square one again.\n\nI work at a McDonald\u2019s and it\u2019s good cause I\u2019m with people my own age and stuff but there\u2019s this really nice girl and I think that we can be friends but I always feel like I\u2019m so Awkward  around her. I am always quit and I feel like she is just taking pity on me. I got her snap and he just started talking. It\u2019s frustrating because I know it\u2019s not true but still. I\u2019m just trying to get myself out of this pit and I was doing really good in grade 9 but then she had to come back and screw it up. So basically I\u2019m just gonna work on getting my grades back up this year and then maybe go back to fusion in grade 11 but I would like to go to this really cool sounding high school is kind of musical, but I really do love to sing and all that and that girl from McDonald\u2019s goes there but I think she\u2019s a grade higher than me but it\u2019s small than the other high school was and I think that it would help a lot. But I think I need to get my confidence back in myself. Can anyone just get any thoght from this and if u have made it all the way to the end I thank you really.", "subreddit": "Needafriend"}

Some time before this, my sister had broken up as well after engagement so I knew what it's like for a girl to get through this and I genuinely wanted to help my friend get through this phase. I even went to the extent that I would stay up every night as long as she needed to talk or share things some nights right upto dawn, I bought her chocolates to make her feel a bit better, treated her to various lunches, helped her in doing her college work staying up all night and even went to meet her whenever she asked. We became really good friends and she always says this that out of nowhere I became her best friend and is like you helped me soo much I will always be there for you when you need me. She's almost over the breakup and seems to be normal and happy now but recently I feel like she's ignoring me, like I see her online and uploading stories but no reply to me. I get replies say like after about 8-10 hours or sometimes not at all or when she has to talk but when she was depressed and needed my help the replies were like real quick even some time after she recovered but now they're not. I'm almost certain that I don't have any romantic feelings for her or that I'm in love with her but I feel I deserve better in this friendship and that I'm not just a person used whenever she's in a problem.

All three being similar through their representation of very popular artists/bands.  I said my order of favorites went *1. Yesterday, 2. Rocketman 3. Born to Run*. My only justification for my order was simply I grew up with the Beatles and that I felt a deeper connection with the main character because of it. Then,   after some conversation I continue with a conterpoint to Yesterday: \"However, I'm getting tired of the middle-eastern, Pakistani, Indian trope with parents ...\"  and I'm cut off for her to exclaim that \"it's true and it's their lifestyle and belief.\"\n\nWhat I was gonna say was \"... where its represents the family pressure on their kids. Not that this is inaccurate, but I get frustrated with it because it's perpetuating that stereotype further when plenty of those family will support their child through anything.\" I was gonna continue with my belief that *Born to Run* had done it better as it played an integral part to the story and was representative of WHY the main character fell in love with Bruce Springsteen.  While in *Yesterday* it felt played up for jokes and just kinda took and ran with the stereotype because fits the race of the main character, not that it developed the movie further. It justed rubbed me the wrong way in *Yesterday.* I love movies like the *Big Sick* and *Meet the Patels*. It's not the trope I don't like, its when the trope is done for the sake of being done. Like a gay guy being extravagant and girly because that's the stereotype and not because it develops the plot further or adds to his character. It's just enforcing those narrow beliefs and I guess I just saw *Yesterda*y as a good opportunity to represent it differently. But hey, at least the parents exclaiming \"you can't ever make music,\"  which I acknowledge, but you clearly tell they didn't care until he made music by the Beatles and became famous for it.\n\nBut she didn't let me finish that. She just assumed I was being narrowed minded because I'm more moderate politically and sometimes my beliefs do contradict her uber-left ones. However, anymore I'll say something and she won't let me finish or explain without saying 'YEAH.\" Or \"No.\" And it's gotten to the point I don't want to be around her anymore because I can't safely express myself or my opinions. I know my views aren't perfect and I know they aren't her democratic social power ones. I have issues with the left because of that. I feel like whenever I observe something or see something a different way I get shut down. And I don't know what to say or do because I'm so pissed she won't listen. I listen to her when she goes on about her's I don't shut her down because I understand her POV. I don't shut anyone down because I believe both sides of an argument have justified reasonings to their beliefs if you just listen to them. It's why I listen to so many storytelling podcasts, it's taught be the value of hearing a story. Understanding someone's decisions and accepting how their morals and values have changed because of said experience.\n\nSo how am I  to approach her when I'm livid that she cuts me off? I already talked over her when she cut me off and said: \"Will you let me finish what I'm going to say before you cut me off?\" But I was so mad I grabbed my tray and stormed off; otherwise, I knew I was going to shout as this has been building up.  I tried to give her the benefit of the doubt for so long, that this would wear off and go back to as before.  I shouldn't have let it build up, I know.  No one has said anything since I left.", "subreddit": "FriendshipAdvice"}

Mostly because I am able to make friends, from the here and now (physically, rather). I guess I am the problem though. This is no pity party, but the truth. Let me elaborate.\n\nI am 19. Still in high school. Swear, I am not stupid (not entirely), just success wasn\u2019t in the hand of cards I received...maybe next round. I finally got a job near where I live, excited, but at the same time, very exhausted on thinking of the social up keep and such with it.

Maybe just want to lay in bed and talk about nothing on the phone? Always there on standby.

Including your name, personality, gender, age, whatever you think I should know about! I mostly use Snapchat and texting, but Discord is always an option. Valero is ready to become one of your closest friends. All she awaits now is your command. So don\u2019t wait! Call now!?!?\n\nEdit : Thank you for so many replies!

I will say that I had issues with depression in the past, but was able to work through it (without medication) and for close to a decade now my life has been mostly positive. I work out regularly (didn't use to) game occasionally (less than I used to), eat healthy (meal prep weekly) and have gotten pretty seriously into board gaming (great for socializing and meeting people).\n\nWhat I find lacking in my life however, is close friends. Maybe just friends in general. Someone who'll call you just to talk about random stuff or to see how you're doing. I definitely have friends, but honestly, if I get a text or my phone starts ringing, it's probably bad news or someone wants/needs something.\n\nThat's probably the main challenge with friendships; they require effort from both parties. You can only reach out to someone so many times without a response back, before you just become exhausted. A healthy friendship needs to go both ways, and when it's not I think a lot of people just resort to ghosting, since it's easier and less confrontational.\n\nI won't be offended if you ghost me, but you should be warned I always respond! I'm always the last to leave the party and last to log off. I'm also very direct and honest about my thoughts/feelings so you'll always know where I stand.\n\nWe can talk about specific topics like board games, D&amp;D, fitness, health/nutrition, dogs, etc, or we can just talk. Some topics I won't be able to contribute much on however are (video) games, anime, sports, or politics (except for a few issues that I'm pretty passionate about). While I do still play games, I'm not sure I've every really had an interesting conversation ABOUT games, same for Anime. As for sports, well I don't follow sports at all (I'd rather play them than watch them).\n\nTell me about what brings you here? What kind of friend are you looking for?

One of my friend suggested that i step out of my comfort zone and actually reach out to people and here i am. \n\nPart of the reason why i am doing this is because i am slowly starting to become distanced from my friends that i used to be close with and now finding myself feeling rather lonely.

When it comes to music i am not really a fan of mainstream songs that you listen to on the radio however there are exceptions of course.

I've been working hard to turn my life around whilst battling mental health problems and homelessness. In my early twenties I started using art as a tool for self therapy which helped tremendously to reduce stress and to process things deep in my subconscious through the paintings I create. A couple of years ago I started sharing my work online on Instagram and talking openly about my mental health. The support I received on there convinced me to pursue art full time. Fast forward to today and I am selling my artworks, I had my first international exhibition in New York earlier this year (which I attended and was the first time I had travelled outside of my city in 14 years due to generalised anxiety and panic attacks), I gave my first public talk in London to a crowd of 40+ and am for the first time in 15 years feeling satisfied and happy and more importantly back in control of my mind. I still suffer from panic attacks but I cope and no longer avoid things from fear. Anyway, I had a meeting this weekend with a potential investor and secured the funding I've been trying to raise which will allow me the kick start I really need to make this dream a reality and finally stand on my own two feet. I couldn't be more thrilled but I've not got anyone to celebrate with hence sharing the news on here.\n\nEdit: I hope this is okay, I am receiving a lot of messages about seeing my artwork.

I moved away about 10 years ago after University but we remained close and in touch, seeing each other every time I went back home to visit my parents. She would come over to our house for Christmas dinner, random BBQs, essentially anything family-related she was invited to. We always bought Christmas presents and birthday gifts for each other, and she went above an beyond that, sending me cards for EVERY occasion (Valentines, Halloween, sympathy cards for death of pets, etc).  My friend knew my mom well, as she has always spent so much time at my place over the years. I found it strange that throughout her entire illness, my friend not once asked me how my mom was doing. She knew my mom was sick but never asked about her. She even came over to my house a few times during my mom's illness when I was home for a visit, and she never asked my mom how she was doing at all. She just walked past her like it was any other day.   \n\n\nMy mom lost her 1.5 year battle with cancer recently. I flew home to see my mom as she was not doing well. My friend picked me up at the airport and drove me directly to the hospital. She did not text or call for days after that to see how we were doing. I texted her a few days later an hour after my mom passed - she was one of the first people I notified. She said she was sending her love. In the days following, I never heard from her after that. I made a few posts on Facebook about my mom and posted her obituary. She did not react to or comment on any of the posts, although she was commenting on other people's posts about unrelated things during that time, so I know she was active on Facebook. I reached out and let her know when the visitation/funeral times were. She did come to those and a small family gathering the next day. Following the funeral, I have not heard from her since. I have had so many family and other friends reach out to me and ask how my family is doing. I have even had several old friends who I have not seen in years messaging me to ask how I am doing and making plans to come visit me. My friend has just ghosted me and it has been well over a week since I spoke to her at the funeral/gathering - she gave no sympathy card, did not speak to my dad at the funeral to offer condolences, and only came to things or spoke to me when I reached out to her first. \n\nFor background: In general, she is a high maintenance friend, which I have always accepted about her and would have never considered cutting ties with her or anything. She tends to get into silent fights with her friends without her friends knowing they are in a fight (based on how I have observed her interactions with her other friends). These \"silent fights\" are usually based on her need for constant communication/affirmation from her friends. Essentially, if you aren't in constant communication with her everyday, then she takes a disproportionate amount of offense to that and will suddenly give you the silent treatment and will interact with you only if you reach out to her first. So it is this constant game she plays in her head where she is mad at you without you knowing it. I live 5000km away and work 6-7 days per week, so I am not able to be in constant contact with all of my friends everyday. For all of my other friends, I know they will be there when I do reach out and I will be there for them, no questions asked. We just pick up where we left off.   \n\n\nWith this friend in question, though, I am wondering if it is worth it now. She has vanished during the worst time of my life and has not reached out to me to see if I am ok. Am I right in feeling that I should not be the one reaching out to her to get together and have her support me during this terrible time? Should she be the one reaching out to me and asking me how I am doing, saying \"hey let's go get coffee\", etc? I shouldn't have to seek out support from my friend. That's what literally everyone else I know is doing for me. They are reaching out to me and offering their condolences, assistance, and inviting me to do things with them to try and lift my spirits a little.

I still keep in contact with 3-4 friends that I've known since high school or earlier. We usually all hangout together everyday when I visit. One of my other friends (friend A) and I have noticed that no matter what we do one of our friends (friend B) will find something to complain about and has to have their way all the time with no compromises.\n\nFor example, last time I was down visiting, we were looking at Magic sets because we were all thinking of getting into MtG. During this, friend B insisted that we could not go into the store because he thought that someone he worked with that he didn't like was playing D&amp;D just from the sound of a voice at a table. Friend A and I tried to reason with him that we just wanted to talk to the guys behind the counter to get some binders and maybe some packs and play mats, and that if that person was there, we could just leave, something that he had initially said that he wanted to do. We also tried to reason with him that it probably wasn't the person he thought it was, and even if it was, they were busy with their game and likely wouldn't bother him.  About five minutes into going into the store after 15 or so minutes of convincing, friend B started complaining that he wanted to leave and that we \"needed to hurry up and get our shit together because he didn't want to be there anymore\", so we left. After this, we ended up going to friend A's house to play MtG for a little bit. The first game was friend A vs. friend B. Friend A was trying to go slow with him and teach him how to play and friend B played a couple of cards that had effects. friend A of course wanted to see what they were and read them for himself so he could figure out his next moves and to help explain mechanics as needed. After asking to read the second card's effect friend B said, in a completely serious tone, \"Dude, f\\*ck off. I'm not over there reading your cards.\"\n\nI'm at a loss for how to deal with this guy. It's like this about 75% of the time we all hang out, and I kind of want to just end this relationship.\n\nTL:DR - My friend acts like a giant toddler and I don't know how to deal with it.", "subreddit": "FriendshipAdvice"}

Exploring the canvas of another person's mind - is such a refreshing take on a genre oversaturated with horny men/women salivating over some random hot person they know nothing about. \n\nI like the first more than the second and third, which are a lot more realistic - but I think that just says something more about me than the actual quality of the films. I prefer the idealized sappy naivete, \n\nI do want to meet another rambler here, **I'd like to see it in your message**. I've met two or three people who I can really talk to through this reddit, and I'm blessed for that - but they're both asleep. One is on the other side of the world, another is just a couple neighborhoods north, but they really value anonymity, so I respect it too. I've found that people who send progressively smaller messages until they wink out of existence, are just doomed to fail - I just can't see it lasting at all. It's a personal preference, **I'll most likely only respond to messages at least as long as this post**. Put some effort into it, let me invest in you, because I really, really, want to. I just hate putting twice as much effort into someone who won't even put in half\n\nWell what do you fill it with? Weirdly, after watching Before Midnight, I feel conscious about telling another person what to do, but paint me a picture of your mind. \n\nTell me what's on your bucket list, if you don't have one, make one. What do you look forward to in the world. What do you look for in this weird decrepit place where half the messages are just penises without preamble, what makes you stop looking, what makes you keep going, what have you found? What is your worst and best experience on here? I was really lucky finding my, currently sleeping, 6 month penpal, who I still text back and forth every day. \n\nWhat's something you're proud of, or ashamed of? Do you think people have a harder time finding good things in their past? I think most people will have an easier time picking something they're ashamed of, but I'm also equally sure it'll be untruthful - :P i've done this before, and the answer always changes months later. But I love that, i love that sense of evolution, of change, of trust where you can tell someone the truth months later when it might have felt odd initially. \n\nI also love horrors, if you're nearby, maybe we can catch one! Or not if you need anonymity, I won't push, promise. I've had plenty of weird aggressive assholes on this site, some of them literally trying to find out where I live against my repeated discomfort.", "subreddit": "friendship"}

He kept telling me that he also felt that since he is trying to figure out his own life he didn't feel like he would be able to give me enough or be a good enough boyfriend.\n\nI'm not mad at him at all and I understand but it kind of got me questioning my own thinking when it comes to dating. I never knew that he was so focused on marriage or anything like that and if I would have I 100% would have had more conversations with him about it. However, it has started making me question my own opinions and outlooks on dating.\n\nSince I am so young, i'm only 19 and a sophomore in college, I have always had the mentality that I don't necessarily date with the future in mind. I do think about it and I do want to get married and have kids someday so I do generally bring it up but in very casual terms and I don't stress too much about it because I know that things can change so fast and nobody really knows where they are going to be in 3-5 years. My outlook was always, if you're happy now then why not stay and see what happens, it doesn't really seem like wasting time to me. I guess i've just never really seen the logic in breaking up with somebody just because you don't know what's going to happen because honestly, nobody knows what's going to happen and relationships are always going to be somewhat of a risk.\n\nI guess what i'm asking is, should I date being more future minded? I feel like i'm almost being too laid back about dating.\n\nEdit: He's 20 and a junior, so only a year older than me. Forgot to mention that", "subreddit": "Needafriend"}

There is my husband and myself, then 5 others. Sometimes up to 10 others.\nOne person has 3 kids, and a couple, N&amp;H have 1. The rest are child free. The kids have always been welcomed during our gatherings.\nOver the past year we've been hosting the majority of the get togethers. (We have ample seating for all, we have AC, we are located centrally to this group) \nAbout 5 months ago married friends N &amp; H bought their first home. My husband and I backed off offering to host the get togethers so everyone could enjoy their new home (mainly N&amp;H)\nSince then, we haven't hosted once. I'm not sore about this. I've been patient, and there is the benefit of not having to tidy the house after (lol). \n\nEvery time I've brought up to my husband \"maybe this week we could invite people over for games or a movie, etc\" . His response was \"you know H won't go for that. Don't even suggest it. I'm sick of hearing her bitch about it\"\nTaking half of his advice, I try a new approach. I message H telling her \"I'm cleaning my house for a couple friends that are staying with us\" (these two friends are a part of the group of ten. They recently moved to FL) H comes back with \"oh, well your husband said maybe we could have a bonfire at our place\" \nI said \"yeah, he put out an idea.\"\n( I told him the next morning about my interest in hosting this gathering.) \"It's been a while since we've hosted, and I thought it might be a nice. And they're staying with us anyway\". \n  Her response is literally \"that's silly, \nWe can't hang out past like 8:30 if it's at yours because our kid will have school in the morning.\"\n  My response was \"I remember. I'd still love to have you guys over to hang out. However, in a completely non confrontational way, I also want to be able to invite friends (including you) over to my house. If I never invite people over, it'll never happen.\"\n\n   H said \"I'm just stating the facts. It's fine if you want to disclude us, but I'd appreciate a heads up next time\"\n  ( This confused the hell out of me as I  had literally just said we love  to have her over.)\n\n   H says \"yeah, but because of our obligation to our kid, you're basically discluding us\"\n   I say \"I know and respect your life  But at the same time, my life doesn't have that obligation. If you want to take it like I'm attacking you personally, then that's your business. It is NOT intended that way. I'm just trying to invite friends over. This shouldn't be the storm you seem to have brewing. Just stop by, hang out with friends, and leave when obligated. Please don't be so edgy about my simple invitation.\" \n  H: \"Well have fun then. Tell them I said hi, and they should come see our new place sometime\"\nI respond \"Oh come on H. Stop letting this upset you. I've stated that ommitting you is not my intention, and I've  even stated our collective desire to spend time with you. \nLike I  also said, if I don't invite people to my house at some point, it won't happen. I mean, just cuz I'm inviting you, shouldn't mean I also have to change up my plan. The other friend who has 3 kids doesn't demand we all come to her house. \"\n      H: \"I just don't understand. You could be planning it at our place, and there wouldn't be an issue. So sure, keep being stubborn for no real reason\". \nMy response: \"I gather that you're just gonna keep being passive aggressive. \nYou can't fault me for planning something in my life. That's not fair\nI will tell you again....\n We welcome you. We want you to come visit. We are hosting a game night for friends while they visit. Please join us.\n Everyone has obligations in life, H.\"\n\nAt this point of the messages, my husband tells me , \"I'm poking the hornets nest\". And \"I don't understand why you keep doing this to yourself. She's too stubborn. Never really been known to say 'it's okay, next time' \"\n\nAs this was a few days ago, I have since caved in. \nBut I'd love some ideas on how best to handle this sort of thing for next time.\nI don't want to be demanding, but I also don't want to feel like my social invitations/ decisions are bound by a kid. Especially one that isn't mine. \n\nThank you guys in advance. \n\nAlso, I've been told by my husband i was in the wrong. I don't see it that way.

We did everything together for years until she met her boyfriend (now her husband) and basically forgot I existed. I would have to call her to hang out and even when we did he would have to be with us all the time. I didn't want to lose my friend so I stuck with the new normal. One day she called me crying saying he cheated on her with a girl at work. I told her I support her in whatever she wanted to do she convinced herself to stay with him and stick it out. She ended up giving him a ultimatum of marrying her or leave. They got engaged and started planning her wedding. She wasn't a bridezilla but wanted everything to be focused around her special day. She didn't make a lot of money so I bought her a wedding cake since I worked at a bakery at the time and that would be her gift from me. The cake was around $500 with fresh flowers on it which were another $150. She was totally cool with that and to be nice I also chipped in with the bridal party to send them somewhere nice for a weekend honeymoon which was another $100. I missed her bachelorette party because it was far away and I didnt want to drive back home alone and I had to work the next day so I kindly said I couldn't come which made her have a attitude towards me. I shrugged it off and eventually here wedding was here. It was a great time and I was so happy for her. Fast forward 1 year later I was ready to walk down the isle and wanted a simple wedding. I didnt ask her to be a bridesmaid because she ended up getting pregnant and I knew she couldn't afford a dress and all that which comes with being in the bridal party so I only made my sister and cousin stand up. Around this time we texted once in awhile I worked all the time and she was too busy with her new husband and planning for her baby. I didnt see much of her until the day of my wedding she came upstairs to see me before the ceremony and we cried together hugged and said how much we missed each other. My wedding passed and the next day my husband and I were opening all our gifts we received as we were making all of the people down who gave a gift I noticed her and her parents whom I invited to my wedding didnt give me a gift or even a card with a congratulations. I was pretty hurt because her dad always said I was like a second daughter to him and we were close as can be. He also got pretty tanked at my wedding because it was a open bar. I wanted to make sure it wasn't a mistake or someone may have stole a couple cards so I wrote her the next day. Before I could ask her she said \"oh by the way my pregnant self forgot to bring the card with me\" \"should I just mail it to you since your going on ur honeymoon?\" I told her yes that's fine and was relieved she didnt forget about me. 4 months later I'm still waiting for that card and haven't talked to her since that day. When she had her baby I told her congratulations on Facebook and that's it. My husband was furious at her because he saw all the hard work I did to make her day perfect for her and she couldn't even give me a card. He told me to never speak to her again and I actually agreed with him. I would never do that to my friend or embarrass myself like that. I would of been ok if she would of said I dont have it I'm broke and I need to save but instead lying about mailing me a card is just ridiculous. Should I just cut ties with her and move on? Or am I overreacting? I have always been a great friend to her, me and her have been through a lot together and it kills me she did this. I'm so hurt.", "subreddit": "FriendshipAdvice"}

At the time, I only knew 2 people - Anna and Jack. I grew up with Anna and considered her my closest friend at the time. I am an independent young women, I had a previous business from 20-27, I've travelled alone, often. I am a free spirit. Moving to a new city by myself to do something big is right up my alley.\n\nMy friend runs a clothing boutique and at the time had no employees so she hired me PT while I worked on a business plan. I felt we had a good relationship, a lot of helping each other out. She was always gifting me gifts for helping her out with her store and I was always gifting her gifts because I was alone in the city and sometimes needed help. I hate asking for help and only asked when I really needed it. \n\nI started my business 6 months later and it became an instant hit within a few weeks. I was so busy. I loved it at the time but the pressure and over-whelming amount of work turned into 13 hour days 5 days a week. I like to think I'm tough so I didn't consider making any changes and decided to ride this out so the business could be successful. \n\nDuring this time I was still working PT at my friends work while working every Saturday to help her out. After a month, I started to have panic attacks, I stopped eating and I became extremely stressed that I was going to fail. The success just seemed to good to be true. I was working nonstop and doing this business all alone, I felt the pressure. \n\nI was also in a LDR, I didn't have a lot of money, I saw friends and family once every 4 months for a couple hours, I lived in a dark bachelor suite with no windows or kitchen. Honestly, it was the hardest time in my life while doing the coolest thing ever.\n\nMeanwhile, my friend was living the life - her business was booming, her boyfriend paid for her rent, she had plenty of staff and weekends off. Her and her bf went on many trips with her family. She was doing great and I was glad to support her.\n\nA part of me did start to resent her when she came in on a Saturday I was working and told me I looked depressed and I responded with '..well, I think I am. I am incredibly burnt out' - she said 'awe' and then went off to the beach. It made me realize that she has never offered to help me with my business despite how spread thin I was even though I was taking every Saturday off to work at her store. After that I told her that I needed Saturdays to myself, I said sorry, but I needed to take care of myself. She seemed okay about that.\n\nA month later, I was still pretty burnt out and stressed. I had a breakdown one day and I texted her saying 'I am crying at my pop-up right now, I am so tired and so overwhelmed, I feel like such a failure'. Which is something I do not do with friends. I do not admit when I feel like a failure, so the fact I reached out means I hit a breaking point. I did not hear back from her that day and she never brought it up to me, EVER.\n\nAfter that I slowly stopped hanging out with her, stopped helping her out with her store, I put my business on a seasonal hold and became a hermit during the winter.\n\nDuring that winter, a lot of people I know passed away, including a good friend of mine. I decided to move back home after all of that. I loved my business and what I built but it wasn't sustainable for me at this time in my life. I had to make better decisions if I was going to be happy and grow as a human. \n\nI was well known in the city and had a lot of loyal customers. Everyone was extremely supportive of my decision to move and I had a great last season celebrating the business I built and saying goodbye to my favourite customers.\n\nAfter I moved back home, I got word that this friend is upset I quit my business and moved away. Her and her boyfriend feel that they invested so much into me and my business, supported me through and through and I just ended up throwing it away. Her aunty often bought my product and I was always so incredibly thankful for her Auntys business. Before I moved away I gave her a free product and wrote a letter saying thank you for the support.\n\nI am baffled and angry that this \"friend\" thinks I am ungrateful and that I disrespected her and her family by quitting my business. She helped me buy my truck because I have never bought a vehicle before and sometimes I had customers pick up my product at her store when I was away. That is it. Whereas I worked at her store so she could have days off/weekends off, I took product photos for her store, I trained employees, I promoted her business on my businesses instagram, I told everyone about her store. I spent $1000 in a year at her store on clothing. I was loyal to a fault.\n\nWhen I lived in that city, I felt alone, I have never felt so isolated before. It was the first time in my life I did not want to be independent. I became numb. I don't know if I was depressed but I just stopped feeling things, gained a bunch of weight, got acne, got sick. I created an amazing business all on my own, worked too much, got burnt out and decided there is a new path for me. I realized amazing life lessons while I was there.\n\nSomehow this friend has the audacity to say that she built me up and I am ungrateful for ''throwing it all away''. Not to mention, she has been saying this to all our friends and has not once said anything to me. So not only does she think I am an ungrateful ho - she doesn't respect me enough to have a talk with me about any of this, I had to find out through the grapevine.\n\nI am not sure what her deal is. I wonder if she is jealous because she loves that city, she moved there to do an exciting thing and then 6 months later I moved there and became an instant hit in her city? Maybe she always resented that I put creative effort into growing my business and not hers? I have no idea.\n\nI know I am a good friend. I know I was grateful and expressed that to her when it was appropriate. I also know I am loyal to a fault, naive and too nice sometimes. I was a dead soul my last 8 months in that city, anyone who knew me knew I was making the healthiest decision to leave it behind. I can't believe this friend is calling me ungrateful and claiming she helped build me up. She did not.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTL;DR - My friend thinks she helped make my business successful and thinks she invested too much time into me. I quit the business to have a healthier life and she thinks I am selfish and ungrateful for doing so because of the \"time\" she put in to support me.", "subreddit": "FriendshipAdvice"}

When we first became first  she would tell me things like \u201cyour my only friend\u201d \u201cI only have you to rely on\u201d and things like that that made me uncomfortable cause I didn\u2019t how to react and often felt stuck in that relationship. We were about 14-15 at the time. And she was also super depressed and told me she had tried to kill herself before which made me feel like I couldn\u2019t say anything to her about how I felt because she was going through a lot and her home life was not the best she was experiencing panic attacks.  So I kinda just ignored my feelings of wanting to end the friendship and continued on.

I promise we're not serial killers, it's just the media phase we're going through. We did the whole Marvel thing earlier this year, and it was Resident Evil before that.

I love exploring new tech ideas and building cool shit - I love the Indie Hacker community. Looking into game dev on the side for fun. If anyone's down to build something cool, I'm always down! Also, if someone wants to chat career + personal growth, that's a side hobby of mine too.\n* This is an extension of #1, but I'm pretty fucking into video games. Like, I love chatting about everything from the state of the industry to game design + mechanics to esports (e.g. LCS), etc. I tend to get attached to a handful of games at a time (been on a Celeste kick), in addition to being chronically stuck on League (permanently tilted).  Always down to play new things, but I'm even more interested in your favorite games *and why*.\n* I  love rock climbing and running - currently (thinking) of trying an ultra. We'll see lmao.\n* Depression and anxiety has been a huge part of my life, so if you wanna chat about shit, I'm all ears. Personally, I'm a huge believer that people are all lovable, they just need a fucking hand because life is a bitch.\n* Next steps for us \\~&gt; planning on building a van and just traveling the US for a few years. I want to rock climb, trail run, and meet cool folks all over. Be my friend so I have places to visit when we make it happen plz?\n\nAnyway, long post. Ty for reading my Tinder-friend-profile.

We are both working professionals, but we seem to have both gotten disgusted trying to develop a sense of community where we live now. It's possible that has taken a toll on both of us over the past few years. People just seem to be full of drama and that is something I don't tolerate at all anymore.\n\nRecently, I have begun to feel somewhat isolated from my partner. I've questioned whether or not he has lost interest in me. The physical intimacy and closeness doesn't feel like it used to. I've become more irritable lately, and am unsure whether I'm just going crazy, or whether I'm responding as a rational being to the whirlwind of the world around me.

Like I\u2019ve literally found and organized the flowers, makeup, hair and venue for her ! \nAnyway flash forward to now !  On September 1st her mother in law to be messages that\u2019s she\u2019s having a bridal shower for her today (sept 15) , I look at the date, talk to my manager etc about the switching shifts etc because I have a mid shift the day of ! ( my schedule gets mad 1 3 weeks out, so any changes would have to made at least 2 weeks ago)! No one can do anything, and I let her know ASAP.  She understandably annoyed and slightly mad that I can\u2019t go, I could have moved my shift back to a later shift but she would have been my ride since the shower is further up north (1.5 hrs with no traces to the area etc). We talk 3 more times about it, only for a fianc\u00e9 to send me an aggressive messages , telling me that\u2019s I\u2019m making her stressed etc because I\u2019m not going, yet only 11/22 people are going.  I thought it was resolved and surprised at the messages. The next time I see her, I talked to her about it and she\u2019s like I\u2019m being selfish because I can\u2019t go, choosing work before people because apparently I value money more. Anyway, my  birthday comes up and we\u2019re all supposed to go to dinner then clubbing the next night because I start at 5:30, they come a hour late to dinner. I get a message the next night saying that\u2019s she too sick from sushi to go? Yet she was hiking with other friends hours earlier! She then messages me saying that\u2019s she needs to reconsider having us a bridesmaids as we aren\u2019t putting enough time and effort into the wedding and I shouldn\u2019t have missed the shower !  \n \nThere are other issues between us based on behaviour, but she can\u2019t accept that people have things outside of her wedding and there\u2019s been some issues with her bachelorette party because her sister and sister in law to be won\u2019t agree to pay for anything toward it and keep dragging her into blaming me and the other last minute bridesmaid ! \nI want to quit as her braidsmaid should I ?

So, this is about my internet-friend that I've been talking to for almost a year now. She is the most amazing friend I could have ever imagined, I just love spending time with her, we talk to each other multiple times a week, playing games or watching movies together, or just taking about various topics. I've never really had such a good friend before, which makes this friendship incredibly special for me.\n\nSome time a month ago we almost hung out every day, spending hours together having a ton of fun, it was great. At that time I didn't have to work or go to school, which is why I was able to spend so much time with her. Unfortunately, this isn't possible anymore now because I've started working full time. The different timezones don't really help either.. So right now, we still hang out at weekends and every other day or so at weekdays which is great. So even though I do have way less time I'm still talking to her pretty often. And that's the thing, I don't even understand how I deserve to be such a good friend of her, she's \"devoting\" so much time to me, I can't say how much I appreciate that.\n\nDespite all of that, there is something that's really messing with my head right now. I generally don't have much self-confidence and I always feel like everything I say or do is stupid / wrong, that's just how I am. Being like that leads to something that's giving me these crazy fears lately. Basically, I'm just scared of  \"losing her\", that sound's weird, but what I mean is I'm scared that we will get more distant over time and eventually just end up being aquaintances rather than such close friends as we are currently.\n\nThese fears always hit me in specific situations, some of them being the following:\n\n* First of all, when I have to leave for work / **when I'm at work**. Because of the different time zones it's evening / night for her when I get up and work, so I guess I'm just constantly thinking something like \"I could spend time with her right now, but I can't\". I just feel like I'm \"wasting\" that time at work while she's probably hanging out with other friends, or making new friends. I know this sucks and there's no right for me to feel like that but it's just how it is..\n* When she's **mentioning other friends**. I know it's dumb, but every time she mentions another friend or someone that she's talking to it makes me sad, even though this may sound like I'm jealous - I wouldn't call it that. It's rather a fear that the other friend is more fun to hang out with. I always wonder \"Why does she even hang out with me in the first place, I'm boring as fuck\"  - so when she's spending time with someone else it instantly makes me think that that other person is more fun or something. Lately she's been playing a game that I just cant play with her for various reasons, that also makes me worry that she might get friends with someone while playing that game who's more fun than I am. Even when she just adds someone on Steam or so, I immediately start thinking \"this person would probably be a way better friend than I am\". I know, it's completely idiotic, totally aware of that. But despite knowing that I still can't stop those feelings..\n* When we stop hanging out. Sometimes after we're \"done\" hanging out I get so sad because I know that it'll be at least a day or a few until I'll talk to her again, and I start thinking who she might hang out with during that time. Again, I know there is no reason for me to feel like that. Just because we're such good friends doesn't mean she can't have any other friends, like wtf. But yeah - like I say, these dumb fears are just there and I can't turn them off or get rid of them, which is incredibly frustrating.\n\nThis whole post probably sounds like I'm some overly clingy, jealous idiot who doesn't accept that his friend has other friends. But trust me that's not who I am, I don't know what's wrong. I'm really trying to be as good of a friend as I can, be understanding, give her time, etc.. The last thing I would want to be is some possessive / jealous jerk. Here's the problem, everything I just said makes it seem as if I am exactly that, I can't lie... I don't have the right to feel like this, and I'm 100% aware of that.. So I really feel like I have to get rid of these fears, but how? Maybe it's because she's my first real friend and I'm just insanely scared of this friendship falling apart? Probably, I don't know..\n\nLately I've been thinking about simply telling her about all of this, but then I wonder what difference that would make, I also don't want to make her deal with this negative stuff.  Like what do I expect as a result, maybe she'll just be weirded out - which I'd honestly understand.\n\nI just wonder if anyone has been in a similar situation, dealing with these fears, worrying about losing their friend.

I mean some good things came out of it, but overall it was just bad. I became more aware of my neediness, people pleasing tendencies, and low self esteem. I spent the whole semester falling for casual hookups and letting my grades tank in the meantime. \n\nanyways, this year I moved into a suite with my 3 friends. my roommate and I didn\u2019t really know each other too well, but we both came from similar situations and we had similar interests. my suite mates are cool, but one of them has alienated me in the past and the other one just follows whatever her roommate does. \n\nso this weekend my friend comes to visit, is a terrible guest, blah blah blah. come sunday night, i\u2019m alone in my room, and my roommate is in the other room laughing obnoxiously loud until 2 am. that\u2019s when I realize she\u2019s sleeping in there tonight. \n\nthey\u2019ve officially formed an alliance, so i\u2019m screwed. next year you have to move off campus, and I know for almost sure they\u2019re not going to want me to live with them. on top of that, i\u2019m currently being ghosted by a guy I had genuine feelings for. I only realize now that he\u2019s not the person I want/made him out to be, and it hurts. \n\ni come from an abusive household, both parents suffering from bipolar disorder, multiple personality disorder, depression, and schizophrenia. so I guess you can say I have no support from home. I came to college to save my mental health but I feel as though it\u2019s only getting worse. \n\nI use the dwindling supply of benzos I have to get through the day, and adderall to complete any task. my gpa is too low to transfer at the moment. I go to therapy but that barely helps. \n\nI feel so fucking suicidal, but I have a brother and sister at home so I could never actually do it. I just want to be loved so badly. I feel like no matter what I do I can\u2019t hold a friendship. I feel like i\u2019m suffocating every time I walk into my dorm. I tried apologizing, but it got me no where. I can\u2019t stop thinking about this guy and about how I\u2019d feel so much better if he wanted a relationship or was just there for me in general. \n\nIf you got this far I really really appreciate it.

It doesn't matter what it is, be it love, friendship, or a discord community .\"Sic Parvis Magna\" - Greatness from small beginnings. This discord intends to stay smaller (think: 30-40 people) with an emphasis on building long lasting relationships with people who are not only like-minded, but share an interest in genuinely connecting over time. If you're just passing through, this discord won't be ideal for you. We cannot promise you will meet girls/guys here who you will click with if that's also what you're looking for. Hopefully you're somebody who wants to make real friends, eventually meet up, talk everyday, etc. all that stuff.\n\nThe current members of the discord are from another discord, we know each other very well. What does this mean for you? Well, it means not only do we have this type of experience, but we will also do our best to connect with you. This means if you're a shy type, we don't care. Extrovert? Great, you'll fit right in. Some of us play games, some do not, this is definitely not that type of discord.\n\nSince we're talking about creating connections with people, we do expect you to be not only real, honest, but we hope that you are willing to voice as well. Why? Real connections occur when real effort is put out. Text is great, and often times we can only text, but we want to get to know you. Talking over voice is a good way to do this, and I believe that it's the only way to get really close to somebody.\n\nThis discord is very small currently, you will be here at the beginning (and hopefully) for a long time. If you're looking for a very active discord, this is not that currently, though eventually it will be. If you're looking for good friends, chattin shit, banter and finding people long term to talk to, meet, etc, this is for you.\n\nSome things about the people in here: We banter, a lot. We make dark jokes, we typically don't view things as sacred bar certain topics, we definitely expect you not to bully people, and we expect you to put actual effort in to creating connections as it's the whole point of this discord.\n\nIdeally you are: Genuine, can banter, will not disappear (if we see a lack of effort we will simply remove you.), would like to voice, not an internet personality, etc.\n\nplease PM me if you're interested, thanks.", "subreddit": "Needafriend"}

This is my first time on this subreddit, and I was wondering for any friendship help. I apologize if the post is rather long.  When I started my junior year in a new city, I met this girl (who I will use her alias name) named Jane, and we became pretty great friends from the start.  A short description of Jane; Jane is a sweet and funny girl that has a troublesome life. Ever since Jane was a child, she has been a victim of bullying while struggling to come to school, due to health problems with her back and above-average weight size (my Jsorta subtle way to say obese) added on to her health problems. Which made her be held back to be a sophomore from all the lack of attendance. Jane and I talked so much about our common interests, as well as being a bit nerdy; it was great, and other times we talk about our home lives to vent out if what was happening at home bothering us. Jane mentioned a few times how her mother is a bit on the BPD (borderline personality disorder) line and is rather verbally and mentally abusive to Jane. I reassured Jane that I can always lend a shoulder to cry on, and to give my ears for Jane to vent out at school; in the mornings before school and during lunch.    \nOther times I wasn't mentally intelligent enough for another level of mentally screwed-up mess. I would suggest that she and her mom would see either a psychiatrist or a family counselor, her answer would always be \"we've tried, and they don't want to talk to us.\" I reassured her again and told her that they had not met the right person to help them. As time lead on, I was becoming busy and getting ready for graduation and college while Jane was occupied with trying to move onto the next grade level (something went wrong on the computer she was on for summer school. That initially made her still a sophomore when she is actually supposed to be a 2019 HS (high school) graduate). During my times during lunch, either from missing a test or needing to catch up on an assignment, Jane would ask me if I'm available to hang out during lunch. I tell her we could reschedule to hang out another day, and it was the usual conversation.     \nOther days on a school night or school holiday break, Jane would call me to come and get her to get away from her verbally and mentally abusive mother. Most of her calls would happen at the wrong timings (either my mom would be at work, or I would be on my way home from an appointment. I don't have a license and a car of my own, and we are financially tight) and I would say back to her \"I'm sorry Jane, I don't think we can help you at the moment.\". Always makes me feel guilty; I can only talk to her about it and find helplines for her situation, but not be able to help her. Other times during a friend group chat, we would be talking about something (i.e., food, careers, hobbies) Jane would then turn it around and say how our (a friend of ours and me) home lives are better than her home life. My friend and I would reassure her how things will get better with time, and she would always reply, \"yea right.\". I full-heartedly understand about needing to vent about her problems, but being said out of nowhere, it just threw me off a little. But if it were to be a problem either a friend of ours or I would have (i.e., how to resolve an argument with a friend or loved one), Jane would help minorly. However, she would then say, \"be lucky your mother is not my mother.\". As for relationships, oh my Atlantis, it's a mess. Jane has told me numerous times \"how I can get a guy\" (at the time and as for now, relationships are not my forte, and I don't have the time for one) and \"how she can't.\" I always reassured her that it would take time to find love, yet Jane would the tables will be turned as she says, \"I'll die alone and never find love. My mom always scares them off! Tell me OP, what's wrong with me?!?\"       \nAround Mother's Day 2019; Jane called me on the phone to ask me to see if I can come and get her, I remembered just crying and telling her that I'm sorry and I can't. All I can hear was her crying too, and her mom said to get out of the house (attempted to kick her out) for not doing her housework. (Just for clarification, Jane does most of the chores than her mother, Jane has no outside family, and she is an only child)  To be done at a specific time. There was so much yelling happening on the other line; I was shaking in fear while I heard everything on the other side of the phone. I had tried to search on my phone for the local helplines and convincing Jane to relocate herself to a women's shelter and remove herself from the toxic environment. After the phone call ended, I waited for what happened. Jane informed me over text that the helpline suggested calling the police to do a check-in and to see if they can take her to the women's shelter. All that happened was that her mom went back to her sweet mother-dearest facade, and to make up with Jane before the police came. After all that, the whole situation made me emotionally and mentally tired all for nothing.     \nAfter the phone conversation happened, and whenever I get a message from Jane, I get a feeling of dread and guilt, knowing how the routine will go:   \n\\-Ask to be picked up and stay over/live with me   \n\\-Feel guilty as I told her sorry and we can't   \n\\-Jane telling me over the phone that it is okay and don't worry about   \n\\-More guilt floods in.   \nIf it's not about the four things mentioned, she would then tell me about how in her words: \"(ex-friend) is such a blockhead for (insert dumb life decision), she even asked how you are too. Idk what to say, so I said Idk.\" Jane is a great person overall, but I still feel conflicted about our friendship. I talked to some of my friends, and my mom about it, the most common thing said was: \"you shouldn't let her make you feel fear and guilt, the same goes for her bringing someone up who you have no desire of knowing what on God's green earth they are doing in their waking life.\".   \nAgain, I apologize if the post is long, I've meant to post it, but there were (and possibly still) some details I didn't or did miss, or there were grammar errors.", "subreddit": "FriendshipAdvice"}

I can't make friends out of severe (social) anxiety, an extreme disinterest in myself, and some niche hobbies.  I would like to meet some people to talk to and hopefully make friends with.  I'm listing some of the traits that I think make me unable to make friends normally.\n\nAs an aside, all I ask of you is that you aren't too much younger than me (like, at least be 21). It would just be too odd for me and we wouldn't have any similar experiences. I can chat on Discord, on Reddit's chat, or through PM for now.\n\nWithout further ado, here is the aforementioned bullet point list! And this is anonymous, so I don't even have to pretend like I'm normal!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* I actively pretend that I have no interests and I am completely agreeable with everything at work.  I also apparently look like this as well. This kind of works as coworkers seem to really like me, find me friendly, and I fit everywhere. This is bad!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* I do really like video games, anime, and fantasy, but I do like to criticize and dissect what I like. I like discussing themes, flaws, strengths, what-ifs, you name it. A lot of the people I've met seem to think that finding flaws in things that you like means that you dislike it - to me, it means that you like it enough to actually analyze it and care enough to discuss it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* I tend to have somewhat niche tastes in these interests - for instance, Type-Moon is my major anime fandom, which isn't that niche, but sure feels like it. Similarly, I've been a Souls fan since Demon's Souls, but that too seems to be niche. Maybe not on the internet, but sure as heck is niche in real life. My favorite games other than the above are Valkyrie Profile, Etrian Odyssey, Final Fantasy Tactics, a love-hate relationship with Fate/Grand Order, and Shin Megami Tensei games.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* I'm a nontraditional Asian person from a very traditional Asian family, so there's a bit of feeling trapped. I'm only now coming to terms with the fact that my family really just sees me as an possession and not as a human being.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* Other hobbies include archery, cuisine, reading, rudimentary writing, anthropology, mythology, psychotherapy, and hiking. I would like to play D&amp;D someday!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* I'm Chicago-based, so CST! Originally from the east coast.", "subreddit": "Needafriend"}

The only reason I got into engineering was to work in the automotive industry, particularly to be a car designer ( it was a kid's dream, so in hindsight, laughable and naive) . However, that option isn't available in my country. I tried applying abroad but nothing is working.\n\nThe only work available for me is construction work, which I can't stand. To me, having a job as a site engineer is a nightmare. I tried it, and fell into depression and had my anxiety levels turned up to 11.\n\nI'm hoping for some advice, because I feel lost. I hate my major, and I hate the fact that my friends are doing great at their jobs while I'm running away from mine.\n\nand the thing is that I love writing. I love writing fictional stories and be creative. But I can't find time for that when I have a job in mechanical engineering. I want to be a screenwriter. I believe I have what it takes but I just need time to write. That's all I ask. But I'm afraid it's a pipe dream and that I'm deluding myself.\n\nThe idea that I'm 26 years old and dont have my life figured out by now makes me anxious and depressed. I can't get out of bed because I don't want to and I can't sleep because my thoughts are always on repeat telling me I'm wasting my life away. Im being a burden on my parents by staying like this.\n\nI am not looking for pity. I just need an objective ,reasonable, voice.\n\nSo far my plans are either:\n\n1- continue doing the work until I find another work which gives me time to write\n\n2- change majors: either in journalism, english literature, psychology , or computer science( and enter the video game industry)\n\n3- apply abraod and do a masters in automotive engineering and hopefully get a job in the car industry.\n\n4- give up on writing and just find a way to love my work.\n\n5- find an easy going job while I write ( but currently there isn't any and I'm afraid I'm risking my career as an engineer)", "subreddit": "Needafriend"}

I'm very aware everyone has their own life to lead, that you don't always need to talk and that we all operate with different lengths of silence. If it was a concern, I'd've voiced it to them. But it just makes me think, because they all have best friends that they talk to however many times a day. Whereas I've never had a best friend and I don't quite know why.\n\nWhat it boils down to is that it seems like I'm a background character in most all groups I'm in.

I have sensed that he has always wanted more out of the friendship in some ways (if not a committed relationship, then at least some flirting and physical affection), but aside from that, we've shared in a strong emotional bond and relate to one another extremely well even in a platonic sense. Over the years, we have discussed our own individual relationships and dating lives with one another and have shared in an intimate emotional closeness, as we truly are kindred spirits and share in a lot of the same struggles.\n\nI got out of a relationship several months ago, and as such, I've made it clear to him that, even though we do some things like kiss, cuddle, etc, I don't want another relationship and am unwilling to go further sexually, but that those things are perhaps something we can explore in the future when I'm in a healthier place. He had also shared that he did not want a committed relationship and wanted to explore his options.\n\nRecently, however, he stated that he is wanting to date me. He also shared that he feels that he has invested emotionally in several women outside of a relationship over the years (myself included), and though it's something he enjoys, he finds that it drains him emotionally, doesn't progress sexually in a way that meets his needs, and ultimately, fails to yield in the type of romantic relationship he is seeking. I should add that he's an extremely physical person both in a sexual and non-sexual sense, and physical closeness and sexuality hold a great deal of importance in his life. \n\nThe following are quotes directly taken from his texts. So, basically, he expressed that, when it comes to physical/emotional affection, it's painful for him to have limits, and he said that \"seeing you physically is too tempting and too difficult for me\" and that he \"can't invest himself emotionally without the physicality and reciprocation of that.\" He additionally stated that it's \"naive to think that we can have some mid-level of physicality, but full emotional vulnerability.\" Also, he expressed that, \"If you want to see this as an ultimatum, instead of me trying to be true about what I need, then that's your prerogative. You keep saying that I should do what's best for me, but now that I'm trying to do that, you're lashing out and saying nothing will even continue between us because I'm stepping away.\"\n\nI understand that he's just trying to stay true to his needs, and I encourage him to not compromise his desires or exhaust himself emotionally. But I feel offended that he's unwilling to see me or further our emotional connection unless we progress in physical ways. Also, however, I don't want to be selfish or make him feel like I'm using him only for what he can offer me emotionally, all the while disregarding other needs he has.\n\nBasically, it's heading in the direction of taking a break from the friendship, which saddens me deeply and seems pointless to me. I feel like it's a shame, especially because I never asked for exclusivity - emotional or otherwise. He is free to do with me exactly what he plans to do without me, only now, we will both have lost a companion.\n\nI've tried to paint an accurate and objective picture of the friendship.

He was really nice and considerate. He talked about his life and what he went through. I was shocked at first due to his sudden openness but he said it was because he was comfortable with me. I listened to the stories he told about his life.\n\nI've never had an online friend before and I was happy to have made one, he was kind plus I really like talking to him. \n\nWe've also talked about various stuff we don't usually say to others. It was a big step from me because I'm not usually open to others.\n\nA month later, after getting to know one another, he confessed that he liked me more than a friend (he used the word love the next day). I was shocked again at the suddenness of it. \n\nI told him, it's too soon. It could be just a burst of emotion or something and he could've met someone else later. He assured me that he won't otherwise he won't confess that soon.\n\nI told him let's be friends for now and let's see how it goes because the future is changing and who knows what will happen and being in a relationship is from my mind. He agreed on it and he assured that he won't give up on me.I was a bit hesitant about it but he said it was okay. \n\nHe also mentioned that he was terrified losing me and he thought I would block him after the confession. \nI replied that he won't lose me and I don't want to lose him too and I won't block him because of that.\n\nGoing back from before wasn't difficult for us, it was different because he was quite affectionate now but it hasn't strained us yet. He was asking for calls but I don't want to because I usually don't like talking verbally. He was a bit annoyed at that and I later complied weeks later.\n\nHe responds fast to message, never forgets to wish me luck and such. It was sweet.\n\nBut these past few days, I feel like he's ignoring me. He keeps replying to my messages really late and I was worried if he's okay because it was a bit odd of him to do but he said he's fine.\n\nI thought he must've been busy and all but I could see him being online in the game. \n\nI asked him if I did something wrong but he just said \"why are you asking that\" and \"where did you come up with that\"\n\nI'm really worried about it, I don't want to lose him and it hurts thinking about it. I don't even know why the sudden change of attitude.\n\nI think he's mad at me but I don't know the reason and it feels like he's saying goodbye. It feels horrible.\n\nI tried confronting him again but he hasn't responded yet. \n\nI don't know what to do. \n\nShould I just stop asking about it, respect his decision and let the situation be which could result to our friendship fading\n\nor\n\nShould I just confront him again until he gives me the reason.

The hours are perfect (15:00-23:30) so I can still focus expanding my home improvement business. \n\nIt's a pretty boring job, so I'm looking for someone to exchange messages or maybe voice call some nights. \n\n   I'm a into diy. I'm not sure it counts as diy if you do it professionally though. \n   I'm a huge nerd. LOTR, GoT, comics, dnd. I run a Pathfinder campaign.  \n   I like to drink and party. 420 and drug friendly (when done responsibly)\n  I'm into all kinds of music. Rock; indie, alternative, classic, experimental, whatever really. Country; manly the older stuff.  R&amp;B mostly 90s. Rap. Hell, I even enjoy mainstream pop. I'm not afraid to get down on some Taylor swift. \n   I love being outdoors. Even at home most of my time is spent outside. I actually sleep in my hammock some nights. \n  I have two non-career related goals. I really want to do an open mic stand up. I'm not funny, but I can dream. I have a notebook for writing jokes, but I haven't touched it in a while tbh. I also really want to thru-hike the Appalachian trail. \n\nWell, you should give me a shout if you want to talk. I am definitely looking to move to a better messaging platform after a few messages though.", "subreddit": "Needafriend"}

I want someone who's just as interested in talking to me as I am to them. \n\n\nAnyway here we go\n\nHi everyone. Thanks for reading. I really just want someone I can talk to often and who is responsive and open. I know a lot of people here are depressed, well so am I, and I do my best to take care of myself but that means I'm not in a place where I feel I can help someone who needs that support. I'm looking for someone who is in a good place for the most part and is willing to be more of a rock. \n\nI guess I should say a little about me. I'm 27 and live in upstate NY. (Guys in the us Canada and UK are a plus to chat with due to timezones and such) I always feel like I'm younger... Like I want to get along with college age people and feel like everyone else is an adult who I'm still not comfortable talking to or admitting I'm one too. Growing up is weird. \n\nI have a bachelor's degree, but haven't done anything with it. I work retail right now and it sucks bit I'm not really doing enough to change that. I hope to find something better someday. I've considered going back to school for a master's but the prospect is still scary. \n\nI like nerdy things. Magic the gathering, board games, d and d, general fantasy. I like going to Renaissance festival but don't think I'll make it this year.\n\nI enjoy anime but haven't watched any lately. I spend a lot of time watching shows like NCIS and criminal minds, as well as North woods law and bar rescue. Although all that comes in waves. Stargate sg1 is my all time favorite though.\n\nI use to work at a movie theatre and don't go often anymore. They are just so expensive and someone always disrupts it in some way. I prefer watching stuff at home just don't do it often. If I had a home movie theatre that would probably be different. \n\nAs far as video games I don't really play any. I do like watching some play who gets excited about it, I just find it endearing.  I like the idea of playing, but in reality I eventually just feel like I'm trying to avoid life to an unhealthy extent and that gets to me. \n\nThis is probably the most Ive written about myself in a long time and if you've read this much wow I'm impressed. \n\nAnyone who's interested in chatting (here or Kik are preferred maybe text or discord after a while) should shoot me a message. I wouldn't mind if you look at my history just to get a better idea of who I am. (I'll probably look through yours first thing lol) \n\nAnyways thanks for reading and hopefully I'll make a friend.", "subreddit": "Needafriend"}

I (28f) have been friends with Kate (32f) for just over 4 years. We first met when she moved into an apartment in my building and had a baby girl 18mo (Evie). She\u2019s a single mum and has been since day one.\r\n\nI noticed early on in our friendship that she was messy and disorganised, like really really messy and disorganised! I\u2019d see her pretty much every day as my daughter was young and the girls got on, and when I went to hers there would be cereal on the floor from the days before, mouldy dishes piled up over the kitchen counters, clean and dirty laundry mixed up together and chucked all over the flat etc. and I would end up cleaning and tidying for her at least once a week, although it would be trashed again pretty quickly! Evie also had no rules in place whatsoever and was pretty much allowed to do what she wanted. If she cried, screamed or had a tantrum then Kate would just give her what she wanted or stop what she was doing immediately to tend to her. Now I know some people have a more laid-back approach to parenting and I\u2019m not usually one to judge. At first, I didn\u2019t judge Kate much either. It was her first child, completely unexpected, she was alone and trying to find her feet. I did help her to try Time Out and other effective parenting methods but she\u2019d give up pretty much straight away claiming it wasn\u2019t working. We slowly stopped seeing each other as much cus we had so much going on in our lives but kept in touch on &amp; off. \r\n\nWe both got on with our lives , I had another baby and moved out of town. She had a pretty disastrous relationship, then moved too but stayed in the same town. She ended up making some enemies through some stupid decisions she had made. They started making death threats and telling Evie that \u201cif mummy isn\u2019t careful then you won\u2019t have one for much longer\u201d. They were breaking into her garden at night, trashing it and throwing food, excrement etc. at her house. But she was too scared to report it as they\u2019d threatened her with \u201cdisappearing\u201d if she did. Frankly, I was too scared too, she\u2019d begged me not too and I didn\u2019t want to potentially put Kate or Evie in any danger. \r\n\nAfter several months of this Kate ended up having a nervous breakdown and got sent to a psychiatric hospital. At this point we hadn\u2019t spoken for a while and I didn\u2019t find out until she\u2019d been there for about a month. When she came out she was assigned a Family Support Worker (FSW). Initially I thought this would be great for her to get her life back on track and get some professional help. But no. She does or says things then worries the FSW will find out and warns Evie not to mention it, instead of keeping on top of housework she just continues to live in squalor then blitz cleans the day before (sometimes roping me into it). She\u2019s so busy hiding things from her FSW she\u2019s not actually doing any of the things she should be that will essentially make her life better! This has been going on since last November!\r\n\nJumping forward to the summer holidays this year and they both came to stay. I noticed Evie had head lice, but not like most kids get them. They were crawling visibly over her forehead and ears, down her back, if she lay down then sat up they\u2019d be all over the sheets. I\u2019ve never seen anything like it, it took 3 hours of Kate and I doing her hair before I had to take them home cus we just weren\u2019t making a dent and it was late! I could only compare it to something you\u2019d see on a refugees hair! Kate told me she has checked for head lice not 3 weeks before which clearly wasn\u2019t true. Since then, Evie has had them constantly, Kate keeps saying she\u2019s checked her and she\u2019s fine but every time they come to stay my kids end up getting head lice. \r\n\nOn top of this, I have noticed more than ever before how the lack of rules and discipline are impacting Evie. She has no manners and is very spiteful, rude and selfish. She lives off an appalling diet mainly consisting of take away pizza, sausage rolls and white bread, she drinks fizzy and high caffeine drinks frequently.\r\nKate\u2019s house is no better than her old place, but I now get her to come to mine as it makes me physically uncomfortable to be there. I get some people are messy but it\u2019s so much worse than that.\r\n\nAnyway, during the school holidays they spent a lot of time at ours and these issues have come more and more obvious. I\u2019ve always given her the benefit of the doubt knowing she has been through a lot and everyone has their preferred ways of parenting, maybe her way was just more laid back than mine. But I\u2019m now starting to realise that it is really a mixture of laziness and ignorance. I have no doubt that she loves Evie and wants what is best for her, but can\u2019t seem to be bothered with the effort it takes to bring up a child properly. Maybe she\u2019s worried Evie will grow up to resent her or something? But no matter how much I try to suggest things or talk to her about the importance of X, Y and Z, she just doesn\u2019t listen and I\u2019m starting to worry that Evie will not grow up with appropriate social skills or any life skills at all other than school influences. Also, Kate could end up destroying her own relationship with her if she doesn\u2019t end up losing her in the meantime. \r\n\nThe other issues that worry me is her attitude towards men and her drinking. She spends a lot of time on dating apps and has no issues with inviting strangers to stay over hers and obviously then meeting Evie the next morning. This is on top of the high levels of alcohol she consumes. When we are together we tend to have a few drinks and a laugh but that is once a month if that (school holidays being the exception) but I know she is drinking equal to that amount on her own quite regularly. She has mental health issues anyway and I worry she is heading towards a black hole again. Also having grown up myself with an alcoholic mother I don\u2019t want to see Evie go through that. Kate already has enough to sort out with Evie without dealing with an addiction and a resentful daughter. \r\n\nI care about them both very much, Kate is the friend I go to about everything and unload, my first port of call for hanging out and I really value our friendship. I don\u2019t want to make anything worse for them or to lose them, but I can\u2019t just sit back and do nothing. Do I try talking to her again, call Social Services or Evie\u2019s school? Or something entirely different? And if I do go to Social Services or the school, do I tell her I\u2019m going to or have done it? Or am I just being dramatic and should just stay out of it? \r\n\nI also want to point out that I work in a high school and have plenty of safeguarding training and this is all starting to scream neglect at me, but I genuinely don\u2019t think this is out of malice or lack of love. But then I\u2019m also emotionally involved so I need an unbiased and outside perspective.\r\n\nThank you if you\u2019ve read to the end and have any advice", "subreddit": "FriendshipAdvice"}

I'm an animal lover since forever, I love all of them, really, but my favorites are rats. Concerning games, I own a PS4 and a Switch but also a lot of older consoles, for collection purpose mainly. My favorites games of all time are the Red Dead serie. I love everything about those games. I'll probably speak about it a lot bc none of my friends have played it sadly ... We could play game on pc or switch.\n\nMy favorite band ever is Red Hot Chilli Peppers.

I'm planning to study there.\n\nI'm a loner, always have been, always will be I think. I don't have many friends, but the one I have are great ones and I'm really lucky to have them.

You know, that kind of person you just met but you end up talking for hours because you're getting along so well you just want to know everything about them! I'm okay at making conversation, I guess, but please it's really hard to maintain a conversation when the other person is only anwsering with two or three words ...\n\nI think it'll be best for both of us if we're in the same age range (around 17-23 maybe) so we'll have more in common. Aside from that, I don't mind your gender, sexual orientation, where you're coming from, what you look like, what you've been through ... as long as you're nice and friendly. I'll always be here if you need me, and I like to some random messages thourought the day. I think it's nice to know someone is caring about you. Don't worry about talking too much, venting too much, I'm always willing to listen.\n\nBy the way ... You've problably guessed it by my broken English, this is not my first language. I'm French. I'll make mistakes, but I'm really trying to improve. I'll understand nonetheless that it can be quite annoying to talk with a non native, and sometime it's hard for me to express myself when it come to more in deep subjects. But at least you could laught about my strong accent and embarassing misunderstanding. I'm up for voice chatting because it's really helpful for me, but I prefer to start with text messages first.

Looking for some advice on how to talk to my friend. She, we will call her M (30F), and I (30F) have been best friends for a while now. When she turned 30 I went and got her BF and sister together and told them how much she wanted this huge party to celebrate. Well I was able to coordinate it and even make it a surprise! She had no idea and thought no one was doing anything! Rented a house up by a ski lodge (it was winter and she snow boards) had like 20 people chip in on the cost of the rental.\n\nThe night of her party she kept finding me and hugging me and saying how great it was and that I pulled it off and she had no idea for 2 months what we had planned for her. I told her (I thought) jokingly well my 30th better be AMAZING after what this took! and I would laugh. I am the type of person I love doing things for other people seeing their faces light up. If I had to choice between making my self happy and making someone else happy I will usually pick making someone else happy.\n\nA lil background on me. I have not had a birthday party since I was like 7. I hated people fussing over me and being the center of attention so I asked my mom if instead of a party if I could just have the money she would have spent on the party and then just go on a shopping spree. I get cool stuff I want and my mom doesn't have spend her one day off setting up and hosting a party. Win Win! Fast forward  22 years and a few months. M texts me a link to a rented an house on the beach. Asking if I Love it. It was like yeah it looks amazing! What for? She tells me its for my 30th bday and she already booked it!  (The Party is actually for me and her bf who turns 30 a weekish after me. I had told her before that a joint party for me and him was fine with me as they are so close and like 99% of our friends over lap)\n\nI see the price is like 450 a night. I was like well 75 bucks each for a weekend (75 per person for like 18 ppl that RSVP) isn't bad for 3 night on a beach front house. Then she says she wants to charge people only based on the day's they are staying because people are complaining it cost so much. I try to tell her to tell people its for two birthday days. Her airbnb was like 45/person so 75/person for a 2 for one birthday isn't bad. She won't she wants to only charge them for the days they stay. Most people are only staying 2 nights a couple only 1. So the third night she has to cover out of pocket. She doesn't make a lot of money so this hurts her.\n\nThe last week I get daily text from her that she is depressed, sad, and struggling with money. How wishes she never would have done this or committed to it. I tell her I'm sorry for this I never said it had to be this kind party. She is admit the I said multiple times to her how I love beaches house (true, we both do and use ride along the lake shore looking at them) and that i wanted a house like the one another friend had for my party (DON't REMEMBER SAYING THIS AT ALL). I tell her I'm sorry I never met to make her feel like she had to do this for me.\n\nSo the Party is this coming Friday - Sunday and she is talking about how she just might not go, not worth it, she will just be a downer, she could have bought me two tickets to my favorite festival next year for the price she spending out a pocket. She is upset at all the food she is buying. (Doing a seafood boil for Saturday night. That's for her BF I don't care for seafood boils) I try to spin things to make she see the bright side and apologized  IDK how many times now for what ever I did to make her think she had to dig her self into a money hole to put on a party for me.\n\nIf she would have asked me before she had booked the place I would have told her well it's going to be like $75/ person and most of our friends won't pay that. So lets keep looking. But she had booked it and would lose half if she canceled now. (SO still out money).\n\nOver the last few days I fell worse and worse about this whole thing. This whole party is my fault, she is spending money she doesn't have because of me, she is depressed because of me. I just want to explain to her in a way that she will understand that I didn't ask her to put herself out money for me. That over all the years we have been friends and talked about finances that I thought we both understood the fact of not putting yourself out of house and home just to please someone. I told her the other day she could have come to me with a \"surprise I am taking you out camping for the night\" kind of thing and that would have meant everything to me. I am not the person that needs grand gestures. I think she got her wish for a huge 30th birthday mixed up with my love of the beach and just wanted to make it amazing for me. I love her for that but I just don't know what else to say. I am just saying Sorry over and over at this point.", "subreddit": "FriendshipAdvice"}

I'm writing this after a year of feeling awful with myself, my life and I hope I don\u00b4t make it too long for you guys. \n\nSo first, I want to introduce myself, I won't give any names in the little chance that somebody I know read this. I'm a 23 years old computer science student currently enrolled in one of the most prestigious colleges in my country but also the most expensive one. Since I was in middle school I got the idea to get into this college but I knew I had to work really hard to get a scholarship because my family wouldn't be able to pay for it and thankfully I did even though it was only 50%. \n\nSo, I made it into this college, but I never thought that I would feel so out of place. There were so many rich and good-looking people that were able to be in this university without the need of a scholarship and because they were locals, they had already big group of friends while I'm here, a foreign student without much money.\n\nI made some friends and one day I meet this other guy from my hometown that was in the same major and he was almost the total opposite of me, his family had a lot of money so he didn't need a scholarship, he had a nice car, his apartment was way nicer than mine and was taller and overall more good-looking than me. I started to chat with him and tried to become friends but I think we just didn't get along, every time that I saw him walking in college I would try to say hi to him but he always ignored me even though I'm pretty sure he saw me (I always felt it was because he thought he would be the only guy from my state and was shocked to see somebody else from there in this college).\n\nSo we took some classes together and I remember him getting really bad grades while I was getting good grades but I didn't think too much about it, I just wanted to maintain my scholarship and make it into a big tech company like Microsoft, Google or Facebook in the US so that I could finally be able to pay my own bills and even be able to help my family, I wanted to be the first person from my hometown in one of these companies.\n\nAfter 2 years my dad was fired from his job and things started to go south really bad. I had to get a part time job to be able to at least pay for my own food, but it is so hard to exercise, hang out with friends or do anything when you must study and work at the same time. So, because of the stress and lack of exercise I started to gain weight and suddenly I felt so bad in my own skin, I just hated looking at my fat self in the mirror. The hope I had was that if I got an internship in a tech company I would get pay a lot and I could focus on other things and not only in having enough money to survive.\n\nSo I came up with the idea to make a mobile game with ads that could at least help me get some food and would make my resume look somewhat nicer and I sacrificed my free time working on it but it just wasn't enough, even after 6 months I felt the game wasn't ready to be launched so I still haven't been able to release it.\n\nTime passed and Microsoft came to my college and I was able to land an interview for their internship and I honestly thought I did a good job, I had good communication with the interviewer and managed to finish the problem the gave me within time. I started to feel so happy, I thought that things were finally going my way for once, I was finally going to be able to do other things than studying and working, I was finally going to be able to lose weight and have enough money to pay my own stuff and not having to worry my family about it.\n\nBut then yesterday I got an email, Microsoft thanked me for trying but told me they didn't had a place for me with them. And in that moment, for some wicked destiny reason, the guy from my hometown passed by with some friends and they were congratulating him about getting the internship in Microsoft. \n\nIn that moment I went blank but after a minute I felt something I had never felt in my whole life, so much hatred towards myself, so much angriness, so much desperation, I felt stupid, inadequate, like such a loser, I felt like jumping from the building and just stop everything in my life. And then I started to wonder what went wrong, how even though I did better than him in classes he was able to get the internship and not me. And I remembered how last year I've been working my ass off while studying and working to get the internship, to finally make my family relaxed about the future and how last year I barely had time for myself. Seeing all my efforts go to shit, all my hope gone just like that, I just wanted to disappear from this world.\n\nI was able to withstand the hardships because I had a hope, I felt that if I worked hard and keep trying I could get the internship but losing that I realized how for the past year I've felt like I'm just dying slowly, living to study and work, working to survive but not living my own life. Right now, I'm just thinking how fucked up destiny can be and that no matter the hard work and the sacrifices, sometimes life is really unfair and the fortunate keep being fortunate.\n\nIf you made it this far, thank you. Writing things down helped me somewhat but I'm still feeling like shit, I feel like I'm done living like this, but I just can't give up. I don't want to make my family sad, honestly all I want in life is for them to be happy and I hope someday God can give that to us.", "subreddit": "Needafriend"}

{"post_id": "d6clq8", "created_utc": 1568892087, "title": "Should I end my friendship with my best friend?", "author": "Trojannx", "self_text": "Let's start at the beginning of this year when it all started. Me (20F) and my best friend (18F) have been friends for three years and were close enough to be sisters but for some reason, this year things were different between us and I didn't know why. In January I met my boyfriend(now ex), and she did not want to hear anything got to do with him because he was someone I met online, she had this huge issue with me having online friends and doing online things which I found really unfair because it is one of the hobbies I really love to talk about, and it was one thing out of our conversations because it freaked her out. Though she soon warmed up to that fact and didn't mind it anymore.\n\nShe met a boy as well and she kept talking about him which was fine, but I didn't get to meet the guy or know who he actually is to know if he isn't some manipulative creep that will use her since she can be quite naive. She began to talk to me less and hang out with me less since she met him, and that made me quite annoyed because she was pretty much putting all of his attention on him and ignoring her friends. In March my boyfriend left me out of nowhere and she only came over to my place because I needed her comfort, though she looked like didn't even want to be there and she was several hours late. I didn't say anything about that, but it still annoyed me.\n\nMonths continue on until the end of April where I asked if she'd be able to come to my birthday in May, she says she might not be able to because of her mom not letting her go somewhere during exams, meanwhile, she said that she is at her boyfriend's house. I got angry like \"Your mom won't let you visit your best friend you've had for 3 years but she'd let you be with a boy you met just this year?\". She had other excuses, but I got hold of her mom and her mom said that it was actually no problem for her to visit me for my birthday. So she basically lied to me about her mom not letting her come. Skip some weeks into May and it is my birthday, she is late again with a last-minute birthday gift that had no effort onto it at all, I mean I still accepted it and was grateful but the fact she didn't care that much for my birthday hurt, said nothing of it though because I didn't want my birthday to have an argument. She then promises to see me more often in June and July.\n\nNow then, June, she asks when I am available so I get excited and say this and that before I go on a little holiday. We organise the day and she is bringing her boyfriend for me to meet. Seems well yeah? Not really. She cancels a few days earlier because \"I actually made a plan that day to go to a concert with a friend\". Either she made a new plan to avoid ours or maybe she just forgot, but her avoiding me throughout the year made me think she made a new plan to avoid me some more. I got sick with bronchitis in June that went on into July, and when I was better she messaged me to hang out, I was thrilled that she was finally able to see me. She suggested to sleepover at my place which was no problem. But then she got \"sick\" so she kept cancelling and rescheduling for the next day. I was getting angry because she was avoiding it again, until she finally came over.... several hours late.\n\nHer being over was fine with no arguments or anything, she told me things about what has been happening in her life, but then she said something that really annoyed me. During that time she wasn't together with her boyfriend yet, they were just talking and seeing if they'd be good for each other. He dropped the love card on her and apparently they had sex because she felt the same way. She was a virgin, and to hear that she did this several months ago made me mad because I was the last of her friends to know about this and the fact they weren't even dating yet, unprotected sex may I add and she isn't on birth control. Sometime later her boyfriend calls her to ask her to come over, of course I get angry at this because she was there for me and that I did not want him to take more of her attention and drag her away from me. He had her enough already and it was time for me to hang out with her.\n\nDays later I decide to have my last confrontation. This time she tells me the truth that she hasn't felt like we were that connected anymore and that I wasn't that interesting in her life, that I'm not making it that exciting for her and so on. She also told me she was scared to tell me because I'd get angry. Yes I did get angry because she told me SEVEN MONTHS LATER. It was something I could have easily changed with myself to be more \"exciting\" but unfortunately I can seem emotionless because I suppress my feelings too much. Not just that but what kept her from inviting me out or suggesting places to go when making a plan? It is not always up to me to make the plan on what we can do, I'm totally open to do anything. I did ask her to take me out more to help me out of my social anxiety and social awkwardness.\n\nSo, I told her that I won't talk to her until sometime in September. I plan tomorrow to message her and to discuss on what to do with our friendship. But throughout the days without her in my life I began to realise that she was taking me for granted and was using my friendship with her to her own needs, she always treated me like I was some time bomb or as if I was some fragile child, she never listened to me about not doing stupid things when she just did them anyway, gave her advice she never took, and she just had excuses after excuses. I always did what I could in a friendship, and getting attached to someone and trusting someone is really hard for me because of abandonment issues.\n\nI spoke to my therapist and my new boyfriend who have been there for me through this because having that fight with her and not talking made me go into a depression, it also got me sick because of all the stress that she caused me. They both agree on me that she is the issue here and not me, they also agree that I should maybe not do anything got to do with her at all. But it feels too hard to let go of her because of how close we were and how strong our bond was. I'm not sure what I should do. Should I end it or try and fix it?", "subreddit": "FriendshipAdvice"}

But if a stranger accidentally did that she\u2019d be offended. \n\nI don\u2019t want to end a friendship because of this, but I don\u2019t want her to be mean to people just because somebody doesn\u2019t know what gender the person was.

Unfortunately I got very disappointed by my university lately for many reasons, but now I'm not that far from the end and I really want to finish. One of the main problems in my school is they make you work in groups for design studios (which are the most important courses) and trust me this can be an advantage but more likely a big disadvantage in most of cases.\n\nI have a roomate who's also a very nice friend, we attended the same school since the beginning, he fall behind but now he's about to start a new Design Studio the next week, the same I have to attend as well. The problem is, honestly, he sucks at working, he's not good at all and I cannot trust him to work with me for a project, I will struggle a lot because of him if he'll be my group mate. I'm a humble person, but the truth has to be said: I graduated for the bachelor one year and half before him and I got a far better mark than him. Then I toke a break, worked for some time and now we're somehow almost at the same \"stage\" again. Strange that we've never worked together in previous courses, we always ended in different courses or different groups. But now it seems like we will attend the same design studio and I will be the only person he knows among all the others\u2026 How can I tell him that I don't want to work with him?\n\nHe's a very controversial person: I consider him to be clever, we have many common interests and he has a superb sense of humor, he just makes me laugh like anyone else. But he's also kind of lazy and immature. I'm disgusted by the idea of making him feel bad and rejecting him. But I already struggle myself in going on with studies, I need to work with someone at my same level, really, even if I'll choose someone randombly, very likely he/she still would be a better student than him. We also never talked before about that, since we never got in this situation, of course I never wanted to tell him about how he's a bad student and he should work way more hardly than he does.

I finally made amazing new friends that I truly trust and love, not like the ones that come and go like before, and a serious amazing boyfriend.\nShe always struggled with so much and I\u2019ve always been there for her. Her parents never accepted her and school was tough. I helped her in school, I helped her through her moods, and it\u2019s still always the same. She\u2019s a great person but once in a while she breaks. I\u2019m used to getting out of the blue texts like \u201cI want to die\u201d or \u201cI reallyyyyy need your help right now\u201d. I taught myself not to answer when I\u2019m busy, which is a huge progress, but it still sits in the back of my mind and prevents me from doing what I intended to do. My other friends say nothing but I can imagine what it\u2019s like when all of a sudden I say \u201csorry, X needs me, I need to make a long phone call\u201d.

I\u2019m not going to have kids and still have hours long phone calls. But I can\u2019t say that because that\u2019s what she\u2019s crying about. I can\u2019t set boundaries because when I do she freaks out, and even if I let a text go unanswered, it\u2019s constantly in the back of my head, so that doesn\u2019t help. And I could never ditch her, she truly is amazing person and we\u2019ve been through so much together, and she\u2019ll be alone without me. She doesn\u2019t even have her parents.

My former boss is reasonably well-established. For the 6 yrs. we were in the same company, we had an amazing professional/personal relationship. We had lunch together daily, regularly went out, and talked intimately about our personal lives. Even back then, however, we had some tension including disagreements that got too heated, misunderstandings, and a perception on my end that he treated others more favorably. Sometimes this just led to passive aggressiveness but at times included yelling or hurtful insinuations. Usually this resulted in us being annoyed at each other but getting over it or me initiating a conversation about how I don\u2019t understand why we get into these arguments. (He usually blame it on me or say we should just forget it.)\n\nFast forward a couple of years after I naturally left my job, on good terms, due to my contract expiring. At a gathering, we got into an argument which did not cool down because I refused to admit I\u2019d said anything wrong. The day of, he intimated that he cared a lot about me and that part of the reason we got into these arguments was because of how much he cares about me. The next day, I wrote to him about how I found the way he treated me at times to be unacceptable. We tried to set up a time to talk but it did not happen. I wrote him a very long letter because I felt he was avoiding me (&gt; 1 month). In it, I detailed what I thought was wrong with our relationship (e.g., he often think I am criticizing him and is always trying to correct me). I also said he infrequently apologized and when he does apologize he often takes it back. He responded that he agreed with my letter and realizes that he needs to treat me better. Now, my response to his e-mail was a little flippant which caused him to take back his apology and tell me that he wanted to \u201ctake a break\u201d from our friendship. \n\nWe had no communication for 2 months (vs. talking weekly) until he reached out to tell me he would not attend an event if I was attending it. I got him on the phone for us to talk but he did not give me any new info. and said if he ever mistreated/disrespected me that \u201cit must have been\u201d that I \u201cdeserved it.\u201d I said if he had nothing to apologize for then it\u2019d be best we don\u2019t talk personally and only interact professionally and if needed. \n\nNow, I\u2019ve left out an important part of the story, that I only found out how bad it was months after the fact. His wife has a neurodegenerative disease and when our argument was happening they were figuring things related to the disorder. He has tried reaching out to me and we\u2019ve had a couple of communications recently but I\u2019m semi-over him/it. The compassionate person in me tells me that most of this had to do with his wife being ill but I think about how nasty it got (e.g., he told me he thought I was going to hit me) and it just hurts.

I'm thinking of including Breaking Bad S4 in there. My favorite movies are Blade Runner 2049, Spider-Verse, Back to the Future (trilogy), The Disaster Artist and by extension The Room. The one by Tommy Wiseau, not that other one someone for some reason thought I meant that one time. Amazing theater experience. Moving on, I have quite a few favorite anime. I've seen more non-anime shows and movies than anime but I tend to like a given anime more than a given non-anime show. Some of my favorites are JoJo, Monster, FLCL, and LotGH. My absolute favorite of *any* medium would be FLCL. I saw Promare yesterday and holy FUCK it was so good. It's gonna go into my favorites somewhere. Would love to talk about it. I also read some manga. My favorites are Naoki Urasawa's works, JoJo again, AoT, and Houseki.\n\n**Games**\n\nI have a self-built PC, a Switch, and a 3DS. I don't have one game I play a ton every day. I pick something out of a pool of games I like whenever I'm in the mood. As then you might expect I'm a complete casual and shit at games. I don't have many favorite games either. I'd put Dishonored (both) and Prey up there. I love Arkane Studios. Danganronpa (main three but V3 best) and maybe VA-11 on the VN side of things. Generally I dislike sports games, MOBAs, and MMOs. Most recently I\u2019ve played Divinity: Original Sin 2. Great mechanics and side content, so-so main story. To my Switch and 3DS, I honestly forget I have them most of the time. Which is a shame because I want to play them more. I\u2019ve wanted to finish The World Ends With You. I love the music and the visuals. Especially the music. I do play Smash too but don\u2019t forget I\u2019m a casual and bad at games. On the 3DS I've wanted to finish Majora's Mask. I loved OoT and MM seems right up my alley. I just need to make time for it. I also enjoy pen and paper games despite that I rarely get to play them. Scheduling and all that. When I do, I\u2019m usually the game master. I've played Cyberpunk 2020 and DnD 5e. Plus Pathfinder once as a player. Even though I didn't get to fully grasp it before the campaign went on infinite hiatus, 2020 is my favorite. I had lots of fun working on a location for my campaign to take place in that. I hope to get into Cyberpunk RED eventually.\n\n**Misc.**\n\nI enjoy keeping up with the news and politics, specifically American. I also like learning history.\n\nI\u2019m into tech hardware. Mostly PCs, but phones and servers too. I\u2019ve been trying to learn more on how hardware works as well as keep up with any new developments.\n\nI like mechanical keyboards. I have a board with Cherry MX Blues which I love. Except that the numpad is dead because I split soda on it. But besides that, my board and /r/mechanicalkeyboards are my exposure to mechs since I don\u2019t have the money to get multiple boards.\n\nI occasionally write reviews, 98% for anime.\n\n**Looking For**\n\nI don\u2019t want someone to use me just to use me to vent. I don\u2019t care about age, gender, location, or other such things. Direct message or chat me to get my Discord username. You can also just use chat to talk to me. I haven\u2019t been getting notifications properly for chat though so I can\u2019t guarantee anything on responses. Primarily text chat either way. I don\u2019t and will not use any other messaging platforms. Hope to talk to you soon.", "subreddit": "Needafriend"}

I really live for birds and getting to learn more about and observe them, and I think I've gotten too good at using long walks with my thoughts to shepherd myself into depressed evenings.

I'm a big weenie and don't use substances because the crime dog told me not to. I'm a vegetarian and would love the company of another to rant about how gelatin sneaks into everything imaginable.\n\nIf you have a hunch that we might get along well and are within a year or two of my age, nothing would make me feel less alone right now than a little orange envelope, or your favorite riddle, song you can't stop listening to, or whatever's on your mind.

If you like what you see, consider giving me a message on discord: DynamiteKitty#9241\nI\u2019m not big on voice calls with people until i\u2019m comfortable, just for those of you that like that sort of stuff. I\u2019m not a big talker - my other half can testify to that as we have half of our days conversations over messages. I\u2019m a really open person, but please if you\u2019re under 18 don\u2019t message, it\u2019s just a little weird for me.\n\nI\u2019m a bit of an odd ball and I\u2019m not sure what I want - someone to talk to, a friend, to meet someone with similar interests, I\u2019m not sure? I just thought I\u2019d chuck my hat in this ring, which I haven\u2019t done for many, many months.\n\nJust a disclaimer, I\u2019m going through a rough time right now. I\u2019m not really looking to bog anyone down with the details or to vent to someone at all, just I like to go off the grid when things are going south. It\u2019s nothing personal, and I do often come back in a day or two. But at the moment I am going to hospital for a mental health assessment, so maybe there will be times when things are out of my control. Plus days were I actually leave the house, or have to go into the office, I more or less wake up, do the outside thing, come back and sleep.\n\nSo, I\u2019m Katie, 24, from the UK, in full time employment and with a long-term partner. Here\u2019s my mind dribble of what I\u2019m interested in if any of you are:\n\n- Computers (I work in IT anyway)\n- Tech in general\n- Games, pretty much soley PC now. The only multiplayer game i\u2019m playing at the moment is Final Fantasy 14 online and I\u2019m nearly at Shadowbringers, yay! But I did use to play a lot of Overwatch, and will consider multiplayer games if I like the sound of it and you can coax me into it. Other than that I like RPG\u2019s and the likes. I\u2019m still playing through Assassin\u2019s Creed Odessy and I have Vampyr to play\n- I quite like anime, my favourites at the minute are My Hero Academia and Seven Deadly Sins, both of which I\u2019m reading the manga for too. I also really like Tokyo Ghoul, Full Metal Alchemist, Yuri on Ice, Drifters the list goes on really. I\u2019m pretty open to trying most anime out, but fan service and mecha\u2019s put me off\n(Bonus round, I will read manga as well, I\u2019m just in really long serilizations but I have a list of stuff I want to read that I\u2019m not sure are just stand alone or are anime\u2019s too etc)\n- I\u2019m a huge studio ghib fan and almost have a full collection\n\n- As you can probably tell by now there is a trend; I try to go to London Comic Con at least once a year - I\u2019ve missed this year though :(\n- I really enjoy art and have just got back into the hobby with my ipad Pro\n- I love tattoos, so feel free to send tattoo pics! I only have the one but I really want more when I sort my finances out\n- I also really like Warhammer Age of Sigmar, and pretty much have my saturday as\n hobby to either build/paint/play games\n- I really like to study, so I try to spend my time after work studying for my CCNA if any of you get what that is, and I\u2019m trying to learn Japaense and failing pretty badly, because my \nstudy time is pretty much just CCNA at the moment.\n\nI virtually don\u2019t have an outside life - I even work from home most of the time. So I\u2019m not against having friends or talking to people that are out doorsey but I can go a bit shell-shy because I\u2019m not sure how to relate\n\nSorry if this feels like a job posting, I just find it easier to \u2018put the menu of Katie on table\u2019 and see what others do or think of it. I\u2019m a really open and honest person, there is very little you can say / do to offend me other than just being a jerk for no apparent cause. Do what you will and happy Saturday (early Saturday at least for the night owls out there)!", "subreddit": "Needafriend"}

It's super easy when you're not physically in the state where your demons caught you. \n\nLong story short, I was abused as a child (sexually) by an older cousin. Grew up in poverty. We are talking no heat in Michigan winters poverty. Abusive parents. Alcoholic parents. Both disengaged. Teased all to hell. Almost dropped out of high school. Tried to get pregnant with anyone when I was 14-16. \n\nGot my shit straight. An extra semester of high school, got my diploma. Figured I'd try college. Completed in 4 years. Worked horrible jobs, climbed up little by little. \n\nFast forward 10 years since college graduation. In a different state. Got married (happily), two children (girl and boy), received a promotion to executive level. Make over 200k/yr (combined), but a lot goes to child care. Live in a house with heat. And granite. And landscaping. And all these little touches. Never thought I'd live in this type of house, let alone OWN it. \n\nFor the first time, I have a solid family, job, marriage, LIFE. And I fight every day, the voice that says I don't deserve it and it will go away soon.\n\nMy dad gets sick. Stroke during quad bypass. Five years later cancer. Pretty much everywhere. Pancreas, lungs, glads. He's cancered up. Now I come back home for a final goodbye. He's not met my daughter. She needs to come. For a first hi and final goodbye.\n\nBack home, 10 miles from the shack I lived in, with mold and bugs and no heat. Got the fancy hotel and luxury car. Not for anyone else, just to make my daughter comfortable. But, it struck me. Holy shit. \n\nDemons are still there. I'm dreading facing the person who did it to me. And his mom. And the fucking tangled ball of mess that is family. I need to focus on clarity. This is a task. Hello, goodbye. \n\nDemons say drink, show off, talk yourself up. \n\nJust my daughter and me, missing my husband and son. Alone again in this place. But it's a bit different this time. So why do I still feel like that girl. Vulnerable. Ignorant. Worthless. It's just a moment in time, Monday morning I'll be back at work, directing operations of my team. For now, I'm that lonely girl who ate lunch along in the bathroom stall and knew she was destined to drop out of high school to have babies.", "subreddit": "Needafriend"}

He is on a lot of medication, has lost a lot of weight and is suffering terribly from depression and anxiety. The family are in a sort of denial about it and trying to pretend he will get better. However in the background we have noticed that his wife is starting to display very clear signs of Alzheimer\u2019s and no one is picking this up (we think because the attention has been on her husband). She is clearly struggling and is showing personality changes, serious memory loss and disorientation. Her mother died from Alzheimer\u2019s and it has always been her greatest fear. The question is - do we speak to someone in her family to get her some help? And if we did, should we speak to her husband (clearly struggling himself) or her grown up daughter (who we don\u2019t know so well and who is busy raising kids)?

But it's at least nice to have someone to talk to at least once a year, so you don't feel alone, even if you don't tell people it's your birthday.\n\nI don't like any kind of fuss being made over me, esp. over something as fleeting as a birthday and presents are wasted on me. Anything I want, I buy myself. So instead, I just like to spend quality time with people I care about, especially since it's a gift that grows in value the more time I spend with them throughout the year, and not just on the one day western culture requires us to be the center of unnecessary and arbitrary attention. \n\nBut the past few years, having moved to a different state away from people I knew who I could've spent time with, it just gets more sad that I don't even have that anymore to give me a reason to care about anything, so nothing I experience or feel anymore matters, bc I have no one to share it with. If a tree falls in the forest, and no one hears it, did it even fall?\n\nIt's be nice to have someone to talk to outside of my birthday, life feels a lot less like it's slipping by with no significance or meaning when there's someone else to share those moments with. Everything then becomes that much more worth doing and experiencing if there's someone to experience it with or just share the small, insignificant day-to-day things that we enjoy or dislike.

When I first told her I was pregnant I expected her to be happy for me, but in my eyes she couldn\u2019t have been further from that. She didn\u2019t speak to me for a while and I wondered if perhaps I had done something wrong, I tried to speak to her but she was just blunt with me. After a week or two of not being spoken to, she finally decided to message me and tell me she was sorry for not speaking, she was just trying to process the fact that I was pregnant. Throughout the rest of my pregnancy she seemed much more excited, she bought him baby grows and toys, and helped me out a little with things I needed. Since he has been born, she has been over a couple times, the last time I saw her was around two weeks ago. Since she came over, she has barely spoken to me, hasn\u2019t bothered texting me at all, I have been trying to make an effort to speak to her and call her and try and find out what is going on, but I just feel so stupid because I\u2019m the one with a baby, yet I\u2019m making all the effort to try and speak to her.

I didn't really try to communicate too much with them because I was absorbed with other matters but I did acknowledge her for sure.\nThen one day I had decided, \"well maybe I should try to catch up with her\" and I wasn't sure how to go about it. \nFor some reaally weird reason I was nervous to approach them after the initial contact. \nSo I was playing some random music on mic in the background, wasn't too late I was just kind of getting myself comfortable I guess? \nAnd she flipped out on me.

{"post_id": "d7ddpj", "created_utc": 1569086592, "title": "Should I end the friendship?", "author": "Aublz", "self_text": "(I apologize for this being so lengthy, I have a lot to get off of my chest) I have a friend that I met at Uni a couple of years ago. She was quite pleasant at first as we simply started out with just meeting up for lunch and dinner after classes and occasionally hanging out on weekends, but that soon turned into a need to hang out every single day. I've explained to her numerous times that I'm a senior now (she's a sophomore) so my workload is much heavier. On top of that, I'm VERY introverted (which I've also tried to explain to her numerous times) and will get burned out after a while if I'm around the same person on a daily basis. Her idea of \"hanging out\" has also changed. Whenever she wants to hang out, she will never really ask. It comes across in the form of a strong suggestion. For example, when she texts me, instead of asking she'll just straight up say \"I have to type this paper, so we can do that.\" or \"I need to take pictures of my dog, so we'll do that.\" It could just be me being an asshole but, I don't really consider that hanging out. I consider it to be her wanting me to tag along while she does something.\n\nShe's also not the best with handling money. 9 times out of 10 I end up having to pay for her meals or for something she wanted to buy because she spent all of her money on thousands of dog toys and treats for her dog who already has a mountain of toys, to begin with. I've kindly suggested to her that she should save her money for groceries and other necessities but she never listens. She always wants to eat at the most expensive places in town and get's upset when I don't want to order anything because I'm trying to make the $300 that I have left, last.\n\nShe constantly asks me to give her rides. Our campus is very small and finding a parking spot is an honest blessing. We're only allowed to park in the residence hall lots and mine only has maybe 50 spots for 100+ students. Campus security is ticket-happy so people will literally circle the campus or wait in visitor parking to find a spot. For this reason, I only leave if I truly need to or just wait until Friday because everyone tends to go home for the weekend. I've explained this to her several times but it doesn't seem like she cares all that much. I don't mind offering her rides every now and then but she treats me as if I'm a personal driver. She's admitted to me being the only person she asks even though she knows a lot of people on campus and has several other friends. She'll often ask me to drive her down the street (usually during the weekday) to the pharmacy to pick up her medication. If I reply with \"I'm busy right now, is there someone else who can take you?\", she'll just reply with \"No, but that's okay. I'll just wait and we can go tomorrow. I really need it because my therapist will be pissed if I don't have them by tomorrow's appointment.\" If I don't take her, she just won't get her medication at all. Mind you, the pharmacy is a literal five-minute walk down the street and she's always offering to walk to the store which is next-door to said pharmacy. I don't know, maybe I'm being an asshole about that as well but I already have to do enough driving as is as I have to drive two hours and twelve minutes down a mountain to get to my weekend job and two hours back up to get back to campus.\n\nI also recently found out that she shares my texts messages with other people. I just recently got over a minor cold. When I went to the infirmary, I was told that it was allergy related and was asked by the physician what type of allergies I had. I told her mostly seasonal and a cat allergy. I mentioned that there were two people in my residence hall with cats but told her that it was most likely seasonal allergies as my allergic reactions to cats are much more severe and usually go away within hours after taking Benadryl. A little while later, my friend texts me to ask if I was okay. I told her everything that I told the physician and she exploded, going on this massive rant about how she was sure that it was the RA's cat and how she hated the RA and her cat because the cat hissed at her dog. I tried to calm her down and assure her that I was fine but she insisted that I go to our student ResLife to \"raise hell\". When I refused, because I didn't want to jump down anyone's throat for something that was most likely just a common cold, she took screenshots of me mentioning the cat bit to her and posted it in an email attached to a very angry rant that consisted of her basically just bad mouthing the RA, and sent it to another RA in our building, and some of the faculty on campus without my consent. I was livid and embarrassed because my name was visible so the chances of someone finding out who I was were very great (I also have an oddly spelled name so that was another giveaway) and the bit that she sent, could've have been easily taken out of context or interpreted in a way that makes me seem like I'm against the RA or something which could put a taste in the mouth of school faculty since she has a bit of a bad reputation, or even get me in trouble. She's sent me screenshots of things that she's clipped from our conversations and sent to her other friends, usually just little jokes that I've told but it still weirds me out because it's never with my consent.\n\nConversations are difficult with her as she often just makes herself the subject of every conversation. I should mention if I haven't already, that she's been through a few traumatic experiences in her past and has a few mental disorders as a result. She often reminds me of that literally every time we talk. It's either she tells her life story, talks about what a \"sassy badass bitch\" she is, her words not mine, how she outsmarted her therapist or just rants about one particular faculty member whom she strongly dislikes. If I try to suggest another topic or just change it, she'll literally interrupt me to direct the conversation back to her or will just start talking about the same things all over again. At first, I made sure to listen as best as I could because I thought that this was a coping or venting method but now it's almost as if she's talking just to hear herself talk, mostly because she just brags now.\n\nLastly, I feel like I'm slowly becoming her caregiver or guardian or something. Despite her talking about wanting to come off as more independent to her family, she's extremely dependent on me. She's always wanting me to somehow come up with a solution to her problems because she just wants me to tell her what she wants to hear. She doesn't listen to her therapist's advice because she doesn't like being lectured or told what to do. Recently she approached me with several forms that listed me as a contact for her safety plan. I'll note that I have no problem with doing this, but at the same time, it stresses me out because A. I didn't give my consent to being added onto her safety plan as she never asked me to begin with, B. I'm not a medical professional and furthermore would have absolutely no idea what to do should an emergency take place. (Obviously, common sense is to call 911, but there was a situation last semester when she supposedly skipped out on her meds and had a panic attack. She texted me telling me she wanted me to take her to the hospital but when I asked her to call the chaplain who was basically her therapist on campus and knew exactly how to help her, she didn't want to, however. Every resource that I tried to give her, she denied, saying that she was too \"delusional\" to call anyone but could text me in a perfect sentence just fine. I ended up asking campus security to go check on her because I was off-campus and couldn't get to her right away. I told them everything that she told me and mentioned that she said she needed to be transported to the hospital. I asked her if she was going to be transported to the hospital and she said \"no, I told them I'm fine and that they could leave. But I'm still super scared.\" So I told her that I would go pop my head in to make sure she was okay. The minute I arrived she did a complete 180 and was acting as if nothing ever happened. Even laughed and talked with me for 2 whole hours. Because of that, it's difficult for me to determine what's a real situation and what isn't)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo after all of that, I'm finally at my whitts end. I feel bad for wanting to end the friendship knowing where she's coming from and what all she's gone through, but this friendship is honestly starting to stress me out. I've tried talking to her, but it often just goes through one ear and out the other. I've tried being supportive but she never does anything to help herself. Any help that is given to her, even by professionals is ultimately ignored because she thinks that she knows best. I've tried talking to my parents and family about this but everyone's so focused on the fact that I managed to make a friend, that they don't really listen to anything else. (As I said, I'm very introverted so when I do manage to make a friend, it's usually a big deal to my family...for some reason.)\n\nMy main concerns about breaking away from the friendship are that 1. I see her on a regular basis. As mentioned, our campus is small and we're literally across the hall from each other, so the chances of me seeing her are very high. 2. I'm not sure how she will take it. She holds massive grudges against people she dislikes and will go out of her way to make sure they're miserable in some way, shape, or form. I really don't want to have to deal with that. What should I do?", "subreddit": "FriendshipAdvice"}

And I don\u2019t necessarily NOT believe him, but the way he acts is not like he looks up to me and wants to learn from me.

Ideally I would love to meet someone where we can talk on a regular or at least semi-regular basis. \n\nA little bit about me:\n\nTL;DR I'm really into video games, kpop, and crafting/artsy stuff and I'm hoping to maybe find people that have the same interests, although that isn't vital. \n\nI make and sell resin keychains and have my own Etsy store. I also very recently got into doll repainting and I'm currently in the process of repainting my first doll! Once in awhile I like to draw/paint as well\\~\n\nI'm mostly into BTS (they are the most popular kpop group right now.) It seems like everyone knows who they are these days and it still shocks me, haha. I have been listening to them since 2015 and I've seen them live three times so far, hopefully more in the future\\~ I'm really passionate about them and their music so I'll most likely talk about them a lot. I also enjoy listening to other groups like TXT, Seventeen, Monsta X, NCT, Red Velvet, TWICE, and more. I like listening to R&amp;B and Pop too, especially female artists. I'm pretty much always listening to Spotify and trying to find new music. \n\nAlthough I do own consoles like xbone, ps4, switch, etc. I mostly play on PC. I'm currently playing Gears 5 (online) and the Spyro Reignited Trilogy. I've also been trying to get into FFXIV but I'm a pretty big noob when it comes to MMOs tbh. I have Overwatch too but I haven't been into it that much lately. \n\nI'm a huge cat lover and I have three furbabies! I'm always down to exchange pet pics!! I would love to see your pets or at least show off mine, heh. \n\nAlso love me some memes, I will totally send you memes once I'm familiar with your sense of humor lol.\n\nIf any of these interests match yours then feel free to DM me! \u2661 I'm not the type to always respond quickly, sometimes I'm too busy or I get overwhelmed with socializing.

I'm feeling good and feel like getting to know some new people. I've just put in as much not-too-personal information about myself as I could think of for now. I added numbers in front of each section where I talk about different things. Technically you only really need to read 1 &amp; 7, but I would also recommend that you read 2 &amp; 3 as they might be comforting to you. 4, 5 &amp; 6 are just meant to be there so that maybe you can find something in common with me. Also, you should probably read the introduction.\n\nIntroduction: My name's El\u00eds. I'm originally from Iceland, but I currently live in Sweden. I moved to Sweden early 2016, along with my parents and 2 baby brothers. Me and my family love it here. I had a pretty rough start when we first moved here, but I feel fantastic now. I play video games, listen to music, watch movies and series all the time, but more about that later.\n\n1. Discord: This feels like a bit of a harsh start, but I won't add you unless you have Discord. I'm looking for someone who's willing to chat at least every once in a while. I'll send you my Discord name through PM's. Hopefully we'll become friends and maybe even eventually get to introduce each other to each others friends :)\n2. You &amp; I: I'm a very patient person, so if you're a shy person then don't worry, just take all the time you need before we talk through VC. I expect that we'll eventually talk through VC, hopefully regularly. You don't have to play video games, I'm totally down to just talk and not play anything. No need to worry about the different time zones if you live on the other side of the world from me, I play with some people all the way on the West Coast and we're great friends and talk all the time.\n3. Your Gender &amp; Age: I felt like I had to make a section where I just talk about gender, because first of all, it's quite complicated today and also because females often have a hard time finding guys that aren't *just* looking for a friend. I don't really care what gender you are, but if there are any \"complications\" with your gender then please let me know, I don't want to offend anyone. If you're a female then you should know that -- despite my age, I'll *never* ask for a picture of you, it's just not the kind of person I am. And if it comforts any guys, then don't worry, I won't ask for pictures of any guys either.About your age. I couldn't care less about how old you are. At first I was going to say that I didn't want to talk to anyone over the age of 21, but honestly, as long as you're cool, I'm down to become friends, even if you're 65 (or older, I don't want any 66 year olds going \"Dammit! It was almost perfect).\n4. Video Games: I've played through a whole bunch of single player games. I've played Detroit: Become Human, Red Dead Redemption 2, Fallout 4, The Arkham Knight, South Park: The Stick of Truth and South Park: The Fractured But Whole, a whole bunch of Telltale Games and a whole bunch more after that. My favourite game of all time is The Witcher 3. I of course also play multiplayer games. Some of my most played are Rainbow Six Siege, GTA V, Hearts of Iron and Minecraft. Note: Me and my friends don't take games very seriously, we'll rage, but we're not exactly good at the games we play.\n5. Movies &amp; Series: I've watched a whole bunch of movies and series. I can watch any genre, but horror is probably my favourite. I really like superhero movies and series too. Some of my favourite movies are Fight Club, V For Vendetta, Inception, Interstellar &amp; The Dark Knight trilogy (Yeah, I love Christopher Nolan). Don't worry, I absolutely love Marvel, but there are just so many movies in the MCU that I didn't want to mention one if I wasn't going to mention all of them. Some of my favourite series are The Haunting of Hill House, Daredevil, Dexter, Better Call Saul and my favourite series of all time is Breaking Bad, so you better believe that I'm excited for El Camino.\n6. Music: I'll listen to literally *any* music genre. For me, it depends on the song itself. Though I absolutely love Muse &amp; Radiohead, so I've listened to a lot of Alternative- &amp; Art Rock lately. Don't worry though, I also listen to the classics, like Queen, The Beatles and Pink Floyd. I have a huge passion for music and I'm always interested in what others listen to. Maybe we could share some music with each other in the future :)\n7. Adding Me: If you're interested in becoming friends, then just send me a PM telling me a little about yourself. The message doesn't have to be nearly as long as this thread, but if you want to write an entire paragraph then feel free to, I'll read your message either way. If you just write \"Hello\" or \"Hey, what's up?\" I won't respond, as I've written over 1000 words, so I expect to get at least a little bit of information about you. Just tell me what time zone or country you're in. Only add your age and gender if you want to. Just write a little bit about yourself, some of your interests and maybe let me know if you share any interests with me based on what you've read. It's only so that I get an idea of your personality, but don't worry, I get along with most people. I might take a while to respond, because I don't want to write through my phone while I'm in school, because I prefer to take my time, writing a proper response instead of some mess that I put together in 2 minutes. I'll almost definitely respond. The only reason I wouldn't respond is if you're messaging me some months too late, but I might even respond to a message that late, so if you're interested, then just try messaging me and I might respond.\n8. End of This Thread: Hopefully this is a good enough introduction for you to get a gist of what I'm like. If you have any other questions then just ask me through a PM. Thanks so much for reading (especially if you read the entire thing). I hope I get to know you and that we become good friends in the future.\n\n\\-El\u00eds", "subreddit": "Needafriend"}

I believe this thing that I feel started to develop from way back when I was in middle school. I was that kind of kid who does not have a great body or the ideal height (I was really short, even now I still am) or a good look. I got bullied a lot, I only had several friends that I hung out with, I didn't have any 'close friends' that I can rely on nor someone who would rely or look for me if I went missing for weeks. A couple of years later I made several good friends but that did not last very long because I am the kind of person who always takes the blame even if it has nothing to do with me just because I was really lonely and I felt like I want to be a part of something that matter. I wanted people to know who I am, that I exist in this huge world. That is why I joined several groups of people whom I called my best friends. But then things started to turn ugly real quick. Those whom I called friends started a rumor that I was into their girlfriends and stuff which I never denied, people booed at me for the things I have never done, people called me names, I got punched, pushed and stuff just because I wanted to be a part of their group so badly, because sometimes, just sometimes, they made me feel like they acknowledge me, they made me feel like I do exist; like I am part of something big. This issue led to depression, I felt lonelier than before. But at that time, I can't really do anything, I can't feel better because I have no one to talk to, I do not have enough resources to go to a psychologist nor could I talk to my parents about it, because well, I was that 'stupid', 'ungrateful' and basically useless kid. So talking to my parents would lead to more thoughts about jumping out a building or jumping in front of a bus or maybe cutting myself. By this time, to battle with my own loneliness and depression, I started a business with several of whom I called my close friends to kind of clear my mind of my issues, but then again, things turned ugly real quick. Long story short, I ended up ordering $1000 worth of goods (convinced my mom that my friends would chip in) without any experience in whatsoever related to running a business, got yelled and stuff, because apparently, my close friends were only joking about a deal the 4 of us made of chipping in $250 each. But 3-4 months into running my own business, I got really attached to the business because I successfully turned $1000 into $5000 in less 2 months (real story, I honestly can't believe it myself when my mom told me I made that much because I used my mom's bank account). Since I was really into the business, I started to detach myself from other people, I left my friends texts on purpose, I ghosted my friends for weeks, because well, my own mindset was kind of destroyed. I had that \"I'm not good at friendship, I'm good at running a business, why should I maintain my friendships because everyone is the same, they will use you, then they will leave you when you are no longer useful to them, so why don't I just make money instead of focusing myself to people who will definitely disappoint me?\" mindset. Years later, I realized that kind of mindset was fucked up, but it was rather too late because I have moved to a different school. I left all my friends in middle school without saying goodbye, I ghosted them and never return their text or calls.  I was stuck in my own mindset of 'every single one of them is an asshole and I just need to accept that I will always be lonely'. This keeps on going in my first year of high school even if I tried getting back to being social, but I felt like I know nothing about how to make friends, how to be a good listener, how to be there for someone. My feelings about everyone being an asshole kept on growing because apparently I never got invited to a party, I never got invited to a study group, I was that kid who my classmate always forgot to invite to hang out, I was the kid who always stood at the back of everyone when we were hanging out and had no one to talk too, I was the kid whose birthday they totally forgot about even though one of my classmates has the same exact birth date. This stuff then led to more lonely feelings, depressed and more suicide thoughts. By the age of 15 to 16, I decided that social life is just not my thing, it's something that I would never have, a friend. That decision led to another idea of starting my own business. Long story short, made $10,000 in revenue on the first 6 months. That was when people started coming to me for business advice or just something that would position themselves on an advantage. Which made me feel really used, I felt really angry and sad, and all that mixed feelings about everyone is the same, everyone is an asshole, and I will always be lonely because I have no one to tell stuff to or am I a part of someone's life.\n\nI am now 21, well almost 21, I only have one friend that I would really call my best friend but always have the doubt from the 'everyone is an asshole' mindset that I'm pretty convinced of because its been growing inside of me for 7 years. I always feel like I need assurance, I always ask for assurance that he won't leave me, I always ask myself and him as well 'am I an important part of his life?'. I always feel paranoid and insecure about myself and our friendship. I'll feel down or panic if he does not reply my text for hours, I'll always feel like I did something wrong that pisses him off even if I do realize that I did nothing wrong. I'll be pissed as fuck when he does not look for me when we have not been texting for several weeks or months because he said that I am an important part of his life and when I went and ask why did not he look for me or did he think about me, he would go and say that he did think about looking for me but did nothing in reality. He would go and say something like I am the only one he could talk about anything to but he rarely talks about anything other than stocks. Is it normal to feel this way, to feel like you are so close yet it feels like I don't know him at all? Is it normal to feel like I am something special yet feel lonelier than before when he is around? Am I asking for too much of him or he is just not a good friend? Trust me, he could be really sweet, he would come and visit me on my birthday even though we live in a different city, he would be really good to me at times, he would be there when I need him, but most of the times he would just be like a regular guy or he would not even be here. This is fucking my mind up. I honestly do not know what to do. Do you call someone your close friend if most of the time he just does not give a fuck about your existence and would actually make you feel worse about yourself when he is around?\n\nAnyways, if you have any suggestion or any advice on how do I deal with my loneliness, depression, or friendship, please do reply or send me a message (I'll figure it out later). If you don't that is totally fine and thank you very much for reading everything. This is very hard for me because I have no one to talk to.", "subreddit": "FriendshipAdvice"}

She's been very sick (I don't mean to sound heartless, but it's self-inflicted. Woman has been an alcoholic for nearly 30 years, as well as being into sniffing bleach, gasoline and other, lovely fumes/substances) So, out of the goodness of her heart, Z let her mother move in. Her other children cut those ties a while ago, Z is the only child around, so because of this fact, the mother has been guilt-tripping Z and manipulating her, every time something happens or Z airs a grievance or gets tired of her mother's shit attitude. E.g \"you can't do this to me, I'm your mother.\" Or, \"If you leave me I'll die all alone, and that will be on your conscience that you caused my death.\"  \n\n\nEver since her daughters came of an age and had their 16th birthdays, the mother has been weirdly jealous of them and the male attention they would get. Apparently, any boys that her girls were interested in, were fair game, and it was not uncommon to find her on social media looking up the boyfriends, or even, if they were around, to be flirting up a storm with them. One of the boyfriends, the mother was caught kissing and making out with them.   \n\n\nThe mother has also been known to try and catfish her children from time to time, as well as drain all funds to spend on herself and her alcohol/substance habits. The children had a rough upbringing because of this, with a mother who had no maternal love to give. Z's siblings cut ties with her a while ago, as they got sick of the shit and the turmoil they were living in.   \n\n\nZ let her mother move back in when she needed a place to stay. She got evicted (again) and needed looking after, after her stint in the hospital. The thing is, she's not as helpless as she's making out to be, she's just milking this so she can live somewhere rent-free, eat all the food in the house and fuck around on the internet all day, buying things and draining what meager funds Z does have.   \n\n\nI care for Z, she and I are great friends, and I have seen the effects of the mother's behaviour on her before. How can I support my friend, while also trying to tell her to distance herself from her mother? Z suffers from anxiety and quite severe stress as it is, I don't want it to get worse, especially as she is in her last year of study, which is hard enough. Do I go the 'tough love' route and tell her that her mother is bleeding her dry and milking everything? Or should I just sit back and let her find it out for herself, even though she stands to get hurt worse?  \n\n\nThanks.", "subreddit": "FriendshipAdvice"}

Also, I don't meet nearly enough people who share my taste in music, so if you're into acts like Metric, Chvrches, Efflo, and Aurora, I definitely want to hear from you!\n\nWhile I'd like to talk a bit on reddit at first, I am hoping to find people I can hang out with in person, so I prefer to connect with people who are local to Toronto. Other than that, open to pretty much anyone. Age/gender identity/sexual orientation/ethnicity not relevant. Also accepting of anyone struggling with mental illness; it's something I deal with myself.\n\nSome ideas for things I might enjoy doing:\n\n* Long walks or hikes anywhere there's trees are always good. I love nature.\n\n* Checking out new food/restaurants. Love spicy food, but open to try most anything that has vegan options.\n\n* I enjoy taking photos of nature or architecture, even if my camera is crap. A day out taking pictures with someone would be nice.\n\n* Would love to have more people to play games with over voice chat, especially at nights. Anthem and StarCraft II co-op are games I'm especially interested in playing with others, but I play a lot of games, so there are lots of other options (though I'm not that into PvP).\n\n* I already have a regular D&amp;D group, but I'd open to joining another if it's a small group of chill people. I have sooooo many character concepts I haven't used yet.\n\n* I don't go to concerts that often, but it'd be nice to have some company next time Metric or Chvrches are in town.", "subreddit": "Needafriend"}

My ex-girlfriend and I moved here together and while we\u2019re still inseparable best friends, I really only have one other friend than her who I knew before we moved here and it\u2019s getting me down. I used to have quite a few friends, but most of them turned out to be really shitty people. I honestly have a significant amount of trauma because things Went Down.\n\nI love nature (especially flowers), animals, astrology, art, historical fashion, religion, divination, and numerology.

I\u2019m into social justice. I listen to a variety of music including but not limited to symphonic metal, goth, folk-rock, 80\u2019s, musicals, and whatever you\u2019d consider Florence + The Machine and Hozier. I hesitate to call myself a bonafide anime fan, I\u2019m not a weeb but I like it, I like horror and gorey ones and classics like FMA and Cowboy Bebop. I am learning how to cook better, it\u2019s gradually becoming a hobby. I love reading fiction but especially fantasy (I\u2019m really loving Holly Black lately). I like fantasy and horror movies. I appreciate a good meme.

I am a little bit weird and tiny bit of a nerd. \n\nTbh, I don't have many friends. There are couple of very close ones, that's it. This goes without saying that I feel quite alone frequently. Which sometimes lead me into a little bit of a depressive state. Those are the hardest days. I am fighting this since my Dad's passing when I was in 2nd year of my university, four years ago. I am the only child, so my Mom is pretty much all that I have left. \n\nMy Dad and I were very close, to the point where we were like best friends. So as long as I had him I was able to deal with the fact that I had very little friends. But since then it has been really hard for me. I missed him the most on my Graduation day when I was called on stage as I finished top of my class, as he wasn't there anymore to see his boy.\n\nSo, I am hoping that if I find someone here, I might be able to keep my depression at bay.\n\nSo, if anyone seem interested please hit me up on PM.

I dont want to meet her.", "author": "Queenixy", "self_text": "Hi, So my Friend lets say Sam whom I knew since high school, WAS my best friend until second year of college. We had a strained relationship, due to some misunderstandings on her part. She had a cool family, everyone was chill, on the other hand my parents are strict and conservative. She was constantly judge our bond and friendship for not going out with from time to time. I have strict parents and I don't get permission so easily. She would constantly tell me how I am the one who cancels every time and how because of me she is missing out on so much.\n\nShe is an introvert. So I was one of her closest friend. However it felt like I was always being tested by her. So I did a lot for her. Made sure she had the best birthdays ever, I would get her good gifts, etc. I was as nice as I could be. My family says that I go out of my comfort zone to help my friends, so they were even more strict when it are to her.\n\nEverything changed when we had a fight. She said that I neglect her. OUT OF ALL THE REASONS SHE COULD COME UP WITH. She said that I am never there for her. I took this one on my heart.\n\nLying to my parents to go meet her. Taking care of her when she was not mentally well. Being there for her in her bad days. et. ALL GOES DOWN THE DRAIN, because I was not there for her when she needed a volunteer for her exam (I had exams too that time, btw) also, because she couldn't go to a concert (my mom refused to let me go, I hate lying to my mom too) also that I don't care ENOUGH for her. I am her friend, not her boyfriend. I can't be there 24\\*7. Look I would call her whenever I felt sad, however she never did the same and expected me to call her when she is sad. HOW THE FUCK AM I SUPPOSED TO KNOW ?\n\nI was really sad, but I told her that I needed a break from this relationship, and stopped talking to her, there was minimal convo between us. then one day, Her mom died.\n\nI was the first person she called, I cried with her, I wanted to go to meet her because she was in hospital with her grandfather, her father was out of town. But my parents refused to send me, they were like her family needs to be there for her, dont go now, her family will take care. I had to stay home, this is the only thing I regret the most. I should've been there for her that day. In India usually the body is taken to their home town for cremation so I understood why my parents didn't let me go, but still.\n\nShe came back from her home town after a week. It was her birthday in next few weeks and I didn't want to abandon her now. So again, I took care of her. Took her to a movie, that day I fought with my father for her, another day I took her to a Korean restaurant she loves.On her birthday she had college, so the next weekend we went out to eat.  \n\nEverything was going smoothly, until one day, out of no were SHE BLOCKED ME ON WHATSAPP, WASN'T REPLYING TO MY TEXT, BROKE MY SNAPCHAT STREAK,ETC. I didn't think of it that much, I thought she might want some time off social media. This was during January-February. My family was going through some tough times, my small apartment was filled with patients, 2 heart patients who had surgeries and one brain cancer patient. It was so depressing to be at home, I had no choice tho. after that some other personal issues were also there. My parents were stressed, my brother who is in high school now didn't do well. So more fights, more tears, more pain. Sam was sidelined because of that, But I was still in touch, still sent her memes, still sent her all the love I could. Still she stopped replying.\n\nThis was my threshold, I decided that I won't message her first now. That we are not friends from now on.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nbut here I am, after 8 months, she messaged me that something was bothering her, and that she wants to talk face to face. I dont want to talk to her. I dont want to see her. But I AM SO ANGRY WITH MYSELF FOR THIS, BUT I STILL CARE. I WANT TO SEE IF SHE IS FINE, IF SHE IS OKAY NOW. I dont know what to do. help me please.", "subreddit": "FriendshipAdvice"}

But I didn't know what to do. There was too much going through my head to make any decisions so I just kept on going with where my focus had already been.\n\nEvery moment I couldn't stop thinking about that poor cat, but I couldn't come to a decision. I thought about going back and trying to rescue it from the middle of the street, at least, but that would mean I would have to run out into the road and the traffic looked pretty busy, and what could I do anyway? Surely I couldn't pay it's vet bills even if I could rescue it. And what if I went back and it was already dead, or worse, what if I had to wait for traffic to clear and I watched it get run over? All these thoughts ran through my head and I couldn't come to any decision.\n\nSo when I finally came to a place where I could stop in a parking lot I stayed there for a while and cried and now I'm in a coffee shop trying to not break down again and trying to convince myself that there was nothing I could do and I need to let it go.

I need to let this go, but it's so hard.\n\nI just really needed to tell someone about this. I need to get this out of my system, it's really messing me up.

It\u2019s weird though. During the football game she was acting like my best friend, which I just played along with, and that afternoon she became infuriated with me. I didn\u2019t think and I lied to her face about it. After talking to my mom, I decided to text her and tell her the truth about it. She blocked me on Snapchat though, so the message didn\u2019t go through. I tried to have a normal night and succeeded fairly well. Sunday, when I woke up, my best friend texted me screenshots of a junior and her twin talking about why they didn\u2019t come. Basically, this ex friend is talking about me behind my back and giving the wrong story. I say this because in her description, she is the victim and I started acting like a bitch out of nowhere. From what I and my friends see, this isn\u2019t correct. \n\nSo really my issue is how do I confront her about talking about me behind my back? I don\u2019t want rumors to spread about me, especially being a freshman. But it\u2019s kinda frustrating that when all I want to do is branch out to other kids in the marching band, I can\u2019t do that because someone\u2019s given them a false impression of me.\n\nTL;DR: ex friend going back and fourth between liking me and hating me, talking about me behind my back  and spreading false accusations.", "subreddit": "FriendshipAdvice"}

This is a nasty habit I obtained from all of the females in my family (both sides)+ I'm a stubborn ass.\nI have a very negative outlook on life and people in general, a problem opening up and forming new friendships. \nOnce I do form these rare friendships, they usually last about a year or two and then disperse.\nI finally figured out why- I am a toxic advice giver. I have no tact and if I really care about someone I am brutally honest and pushy like my life depends on it. \nI met this girl last year (we'vebeen friends for a year and a half), and she is the most amazing person in the world with the best personality ever. She makes friends easily,  she is lovable to the point where people fall for her energy and aura and her genuine smile instantaneously. I did. I trust this girl immensely,  but I've noticed that I've changed my attitude towards her and became more pushy. She started telling me when I'm  being a bit too much ( and I appreciate this a lot). But it is very difficult for me to change these attitudes (strong ego, and fear of change). I will try my best in future to change this...\n\nNow, she started finding new friends ( she's new in town and had few ppl besides her bf) and having fun.  Also started to fade me out. And I get it . I really do. \n\nWhat I am considering is just breaking off contact completely.  \nI don't want to smother her. And don't think she deserves a toxic friend like me- I honestly think that she should shine and have the world at her feet.\nI look st myself as a dark cloud behind her that smothers her energy.\nI tried going to a specialist and talking about it- but non seem to be able or willing to help me. \nI am going to try and consciously fix these issues, but  I am pretty sure that this will take a very long time and a lot of work.

I am writing this late at night as I feel sad and can't sleep.\n\nSo a few months ago, I made this post on another subreddit: https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/b8jlij/aita_in_this_situation_with_a_formerly_close\n\nThe details of the situation are in that post, but to summarise, I (30F) had a close online friendship with a woman in another country (32F) for over ten years. We never met in person, but I considered her one of my best friends and possibly my closest confidant, and believed this to be mutual (although I am unsure now whether this was ever the case). Just over 6 months ago, my former friend lost a close family member. She told me about this, and I wanted to balance being there for her with giving her space to process such a huge loss. However, my attempts to reach out to her were met with silence. Finally, I tried to reach out to one of her friends with whom I had previously interacted. Following this, my friend messaged me demanding that I stop messaging her friends. My gut reaction to this was horror that I had made things worse despite having the best of intentions, and I apologised. However, I received no reply. Later, my sadness turned to anger and I temporarily blocked her on some platforms (but nowhere permanent or noticeable, and I later unblocked her on most of them). I also blocked all her close friends whose social media IDs I know (I wasn't friends with any of them, but I blocked them anyway out of anger since my friend had told me that I shouldn't message her friends. I doubt any of them cared or noticed this, but it made me feel good at the time.)\n\nIt's been months since I made that AITA post, and the only interaction I've had with my former friend since then was me wishing her a happy birthday, for which she thanked me. I said I hoped she'd been well and that she had a lovely day, and she didn't reply to that or initiate any further conversation. When my birthday came around (which she must have remembered, because her brother's is a day or so after mine), I got nothing from her (and it was the big 3-0, so like, even the bare minimum would have been nice...).\n\nIt's obvious to anyone looking at this situation from the outside that this friendship is over. She has not unfollowed or blocked me anywhere (something I find infuriating, because why leave channels of communication open with someone when you clearly want nothing to do with them?), but it's brutally clear from her behaviour that she has completely washed her hands of me. However, I find myself unable to move on. It's been months since we have had any kind of conversation, yet I am not able to bring myself to block her, and I am still not able to give up hope that we will someday be able to rekindle the friendship we once had. It's the friendship equivalent of carrying a torch for someone who doesn't give a toss. I am also wracked with guilt that all this must have happened because I wasn't understanding enough or somehow messed up majorly in a way that I can't even conceptualise. I feel like I must be a terrible person without realising it. The heartbreak I feel over this situation follows me wherever I go, and I haven't been able to shake it. I don't really know who to turn to with these emotions. My boyfriend is super-supportive, but I try not to bother him too much with these feelings, because we've spoken about it a lot and it's just repetitive if I keep bringing it up. And obviously my closest confidant apart from my boyfriend was, well, the friend who no longer speaks to me. I've talked to a couple of other friends about the situation briefly, but I don't like being too vulnerable (I find it embarrassing), and I also don't think they understand what I'm going through on a fundamental level (they can't conceive of having a bond with someone online for so many years without ever meeting them in person). I don't really want to open up to people only for them to tell me that I'm overreacting because we never actually met, or that I should just let go and move on because it was \"just an online friendship\".\n\nMy question is - how do I actually let go of this friendship? We had such a long history together - a third of my lifespan. I keep clicking on her social media to check whether I'm blocked yet or not and to see what she's up to (even though she hardly posts). In a way, it's worse that she hasn't blocked me because at least hatred means that there was something meaningful there in the first place? This is just indifference, which is the most hurtful thing. Also, since we were friends for so many years, so many random things remind me of her. Sometimes I'm having a good day and I come across or think of something that reminds me of her and that instantly dampens my mood. I'm trying to create new associations for the things that remind me of her, but so far, nothing's been particularly effective. I keep thinking I'm moving on, and there are some days where I feel like I'm reaching a point of no longer caring about her, but I'm always forced to confront the fact that I actually still do care. Last night, I had a dream in which I reached out to her and she told me that she'd been depressed and couldn't bring herself to converse with me, and we managed to rekindle some sort of friendship, and my dream self was so relieved. I remember realising in the dream that I've felt a sense of heartbreak in the back of my mind every day since the friendship had ended, and that heartbreak stopped in the dream because we were finally friends again. I woke up feeling so happy, and then I realised that it was all just a dream, and since then, I've felt worse than ever.\n\nI just want to know how to move on from this situation. What can I do? I don't feel like I have any other friends around me to whom I feel as close as I did to this friend. She and my boyfriend are the only people with whom I've felt able to be fully open and myself. I have many friends I meet up with whose company I enjoy, and my boyfriend is absolutely wonderful, but I feel a hole in my heart where the deep female friendship I shared with this woman used to be, and I don't know how to fill it, or if it ever can be filled. I really don't know what to do.\n\nThank you if you read this far. Any advice would be appreciated.", "subreddit": "FriendshipAdvice"}

I am not afraid to talk to new people (which will come up soon), but I always like to maintain a slow and stable \"hi, bye\" friendship before getting too involed. My only problem is that i've never actually had to outwardly \"end\" a friendship, since any distance in relationships was always caused by other external reasons (moved to a new country, for instance).\n\nNow, very recently I had met a gentleman while having lunch alone. We were sitting reletively close together in the food court and he admired my drawings (was sketching). Eventually we had a nice, casual, and generally satisfying convo about the arts that led to an exchange of email. (FYI he, an older gentleman, mentioned he was also an artist).\n\nWe've only been in touch for about 10 days now, but over that bit of time he himself had opened up a lot to me; not to get into the personal specifics, but he had mentioned battling depression, drug abuse (now clean), and trauma. \n\nHere, I dig my hole. I offered to be a listening ear if he ever felt down, because I hate to see people suffer alone. The last time I failed to be there, the story didn't end in a positive way and it haunts.\n\nThe problem now is that I began to realize my mental and emotional capacity for the first time ever. The ambush of emotional messages everyday and the overabundance of personal addresses (which you would expect to hear between Bf and Gf after a month of dating, like, \"My Dear\"/\"My Sweet\"/\"My Darling\") makes me extremely uncomfortable and regret talking to this person in the first place. Thing is is that I'm basically the only person he talks to other than his counsellor.\n\nConcern is, I don't want to be an ass and just ghost him. This person is obviously lonely and in dire need of someone to talk to. The over attatchment obviously a result of that. If I did cut him out, I'm a little nervous how he may handle that. But if I stay, I don't know how to emotionally cope: I'm still young (ish) and still figuring out life. I no longer feeling comfortable having this gent message me.\n\nHow can I slowly show a need for distance, without just ghosting? How do I detatch without making someone feel like they 'don't deserve friendship'? \n\nThis is the wrong subreddit to ask, but am I being an asshole?\n\nAlso, we had only ever communicated digitally since we first met that day. He wants to meet up again, but I don't feel ready/comfortable enough to do such a thing.\n\nNo expectation for a solid answer, but any small piece of advice would help...Thank you.\n\nBtw, I learned my lesson, don't talk to strangers.", "subreddit": "FriendshipAdvice"}

Pretty much the story is that my girlfriend and I had just started dating and we planned the trip before I started dating her. Last minute one of the people who was driving half of us up got sick so my girlfriend offered to take us. My best friend at the time seemed  upset and was weird the entire trip. My bestfriend and I were sort of on rocky territory. We were friends that hung out all the time but the power dynamic was weird and I  definitely realize she was toxic and emotionally abusive. We had been friends again for a year after having a huge fall out where she also didn't talk to me for a whole year before that. Allowing her to be my friend again was hard the first time and building that trust was not easy at all but somehow I thought we were managing (dysfunctionally), I think I just really wanted to believe we could have a friendship. So after the trip, I reached out to her to see if everything was okay and if she would let me know if there was something wrong, she said yes. So I left it at that. A whole year later and nothing from her. I did not want to make the same mistake so I have cut all ties with her. Some of my friend's still hang out with her which is awkward considering they know all of this, but I guess I try to not pay attention to it  It's just sucky because I can't hang out with my usual group of friends since she's always going out with them and they don't invite me because of this whole situation. I think when they invite they just expect I could at least be cordial with her but it literally feels like being in the same room as an abuser. I feel stupid for missing her sometimes but I also know it was a bad relationship. We just did a lot together and I honestly am still getting over it. I didn't always get why people stay with their abusive partners but I get it now even though it happened with a friend. I just stuck around her even though she always put me down and hurt me. I guess I let the brief nice moments make me believe it would be okay.", "subreddit": "friendship"}

Been on Reddit 5+ years but some of my friends know my main account) \n\nHey Friends! I'm Nick. I recently have been going through some troubling experiences and I could really use some people to talk to. I actually met a friend on Reddit and felt betrayed by something that happened. She didnt say or do anything except leave and not even say if she was angry or what not. Same shit happened with me and my Ex-girlfriend. Seems like I have a pattern of being friends with girls who aren't cool with who I am, and I'm kinda sick of it. Reason I'm posting here is  to kinda ease my loneliness a bit. Many of my friends have left for college and the friends that are still here I havent talked to much because we've been super busy and havent been able to make time. Now I'm the one whose got all this free time, so if you care to learn about me and what I value in friends, then keep reading and I'll see you at the bottom and hopefully in PM!\n\nA bit of background information, \nI like to establish friendships very quickly. I'm generally one to trust pretty easily if I dont have a reason to believe otherwise. Many have abused this unfortunately. I'd love to talk with a girl preferably my age (17-21) that is cool with honest communication. If for whatever reason I fight with a friend I want to know that we can trust each other and have each others backs to rebuild and make it stronger. I'm a maker of many mistakes, but I am also quick to forgive and forget. I feel like I couldn't ask for anything easier, yet so many women I've ever talked with in my life dont ever wanna speak their mind. Sorry if that sounds off putting to anyone reading this but I have no issue in establishing a friendship boundary and telling people how I want things run. I'm tired of people thinking that they have a place in telling me my mistakes when they're no better. I try and live a good life but I never claimed to be perfect. Last thing before actual interesting things about my life; what goes around comes around. I'll try not to be a dick so long as I'm not treated as such. You mess with the bear cub, you're gonna get mauled by a bear 5x stronger than what you did to its cub.\n\nIf you managed to read that essay and still think you might be interested, here's some things about me:\n\nI love video games, PC and a bit of PS4, though J havent had much time to grind any PS4 games. \n\nI am studying music at my university. Its about the only thing I feel like I understood better than anything else like Math, Science, or English. \n\nI weightlift from time to time (not super consistently) but I'd love to talk exercise and fitness! On a similar foot, I'm about 5'9, so not a tall guy. \n\nJust like any other privileged white person I like movies and Hulu and Netflix. I've watched a couple of popular anime all the way through so I'm down to talk about that too.\n\nI would be okay if a friendship ended up turning into a relationship down the line. I would prefer to be good friends first though to be able to get past any hidden barriers that may manifest into an early relationship. I dont mind talking about NSFW/sexual things but please only bring that up in PM. \n\nMany people have told me that after they get through the super hard shell that is my personality and method of life, that I'm pretty easy to talk to and give solid advice when asked for it. I probably overthink life more than I should, so I delve a little bit into life philosophy, but nothing too extreme. \n\nSend me a PM if you'd like to chat! Thanks! :) please properly introduce yourself. I would love a first name and age included in that and maybe some hobbies or similar interests.", "subreddit": "Needafriend"}

We didn\u2019t have an argument. I have been busy and packing for my new job and moved only about 30 minutes away from where I used to live. A day before I moved I asked her if we were still friends bc she has been very distant. She got a boyfriend over the summer and spends most of her time with him or working or with a few other close friends. I didn\u2019t reply back to her text immediately bc I felt I needed to think through a reply. She said we would always be friends and I didn\u2019t know what to say really bc I don\u2019t really believe it to be earnest but I didn\u2019t want to be heartless either. That was a few days ago. I check my socials and found she unfollowed me on Instagram from her fake account where she posts everything super personal. I was confused and kinda annoyed bc instead of her being happy for me about me finally moving to this new city she pulled some petty crap like that. I have other friends who care about me but I just am disappointed. She and I used to be very close up until 5 months ago or so and then things just went sideways. Idk I think I put faith into the wrong person. She can and is very childish, as I can be too, but I generally try to talk about my feelings instead of ignoring a situation. She did something similar about a month ago bc I was upset about her cancelling on me after a couple weeks without hanging out and then proceeding to go out a day later with a mutual friend of ours without a thought about me. It just hurt bc it was physical proof of what I knew: she didn\u2019t care enough or want hang. Obviously I can see now she doesn\u2019t care about me for whatever reason like she used to. It\u2019s just hard for me to understand why. I\u2019m very much over the whole situation. I know she and I are very different people. She is very beautiful and knows this and cares a lot about her looks and guys, all those kinds of things. I\u2019m more of a tomboy, don\u2019t wear a lot of makeup, and dress kinda androgynously. I care a lot about my schooling and going to law school while she is figuring out her major at our local\ncc. I wonder now what ever bonded us at all. Idk the more I think the more I realize she isn\u2019t who I thought her up to be. She has a lot of potential but she doesn\u2019t like school enough to get where she could go bc she is bright. She cares so much about material things and male approval. I often saw her limit herself bc she was so enamored with the newest person or heartbroken over it inevitably not working out. Idk I don\u2019t care anymore I guess but it just sucks bc I did care and idk why she decided to just stop talking. She still follows and checks my other socials but I will probably unadd her bc I don\u2019t want to give space to someone like her in my life anymore.", "subreddit": "friendship"}

I basically abandoned potential long term friends for him that time because I believed he was right (he wasn't but it be like that most of the time). Soon after, I started to realize his tendencies to make friends and cut them off like it was normal. \n\nEven in our friendship, there were times when he would ignore me for days just because I didn't accompany him or just for not answering him while I was doing something else important. I understand that me not answering when I clearly heard him was rude and inexcusable  but I have warned him and told him the signs when I could possibly be tired of socializing. He gets angry when I don't answer him when I already told him before hand not to interrupt me.\n\nHe confides into anyone that he thinks will open up if he does, too (obviously no one did). I have friends from my previous school in my current school so I can chat and hang out with them during breaks but I'm starting to regret introducing him to them. I don't want to deprive him of new friends but he tends to push me out of conversations when both us are with my friends, he interrupts me and teases me with my insecurities in front of them that makes me visibly uncomfortable. My friends told me that he was too clingy with them and inserts himself in situations that did not require his presence and opinion. As his friend, I have told him many times that most of his actions are inappropriate and annoyingly clingy and that he was reckless. He said many times that he was not reckless only extroverted and eager to make friends.\n\nMy friend, sadly, cannot keep friends very long, when he feels that a person or friend is talking about him badly or thinking about it. He will say bad things about them.  \nIf he gets grouped with people he doesn't like he would blame them for unmotivating  him from doing school work. I have put up with his attitude and behaviour for 4 months now but the last straw was when he talked behind my friend's back and was not taking me seriously when I clearly asked him to take what I was saying seriously. I stopped talking to him because he was making me too uncomfortable and unsure of myself with his jokes.\n\nI haven't talked to him for almost a week. \n\nWhat should I do? Should I confront him? Did I do the right thing? Can I do anything to help him realize his problems and mine? \nWas there any better way to make things turn out? \n\nPlease do share your thoughts and give me advise, this is the first time I've experienced this.

She opened up a lot to me about her psychological issues and she liked spending time with me. The thing is that while I was there for her during her difficult times , because I wanted to support her , I was never really comfortable with sharing my problems and family affairs with her even though she wanted me to open up to her as well. Nor do I love spending time with her because the things she wants to talk about and do are very different to what I want to discuss and do. She loves fashion , clubbing , shopping , cooking , make-up , edm music , the beach , islands and boys/love and I'm not interested in any of that. She's not interested in what I like either. And we are both university students now so we go to different schools. So , I've started growing apart from her . Declining invitations to go out clubbing or to travel in the summer. I don't mind it but I feel kind of guilty and bad because when she regresses and is going through difficult times , I won't be able to be there for her and I don't want her to be alone. But I just don't really feel like we are on the same page or have things in common and it's tiring to be her friend. But not during the difficult times , I don't mind being there for her , but during the good times , in everyday life. And I guess , I'm not as committed in our friendship as she is. Or rather I don't trust her as much as she trusts me. What should I do ? Should I just break away like I've been thinking of?", "subreddit": "FriendshipAdvice"}

We have spent the majority of our time together this summer and we're really close. I opened about to her about really personal things and she was always there to listen. From the start of our friendship I had feelings for her but never said anything because a) she expressed that she wasn't into me/girls and b) i knew if she ever developed feelings she wouldn't want them because of her religious background. So jump forward to last sunday we are hanging out and I'm telling her a somewhat personal story out of the blue and she says to me, \"what if I told you I liked you more than a friend?\" and after she said that i went into shock... she kinda got up and said \"i'll let you think about it for a couple days\" and then left. the next day i texted her and apologized for my reaction and told her i really want to talk to her. she seemed really open to a conversation. we planned on talking wednesday, 3 days after our initial conversation and she cancelled on me because she was so stressed with work and what was happening with us. I was like okay I understand.... a day or so later I called her and sent her a text and she didn't reply.... something changed...finally saturday she called me, but hung up immediately after it rung. i texted her and told her i was concerned and she told me that she meant what she said, she has feelings for me but she knows nothing can go past her simply expressing her feelings. she told me she needs to take a step back for a while and then she blocked my number. i messaged her on facebook and told her that i won't bother her anymore, but i wanted her to know that i'd had feelings for her for months and that if she ever changed her mind i would be here. a couple hours later she unfriended me on everything. just a week before this she was asking me if one day when she gets married and has kids if i'll come and visit, we talked about my issue with thinking all my friends are going to leave me, we talked about concerts we wanted to go to together. this all feels like it happened super suddenly and i'm having a really hard time coming to terms with the fact we may never talk again, that despite the fact she told me she could see us being friends for a really long time, she doesn't want me in her life. and i get that she doesn't want to have feelings for a girl, and that's stressful, i do.... but i just don't know how to cope. i haven't been in love like this, i haven't had somebody i felt so comfortable with before. i don't really know what i'm looking for here but i really needed to tell people. am i allowed to contact her down the road? do i just have to hope one day she reaches out to me? do i just have to forget how important she is/was to me? even just as a friend.... i just want our friendship back again.\n\n\nTD;LR My best friend tells me she needs to step back for a while after confessing she has feelings for me and now she blocked/removed me on everything.

The story usually goes like this : We meet in some way, hit it off with casual banter, and then often being freakily similar/having common interests etc., we have what is almost a 'honeymoon period' where we are inseparable, enjoying each others company and just getting each other on another level  - and so much so that people comment on it. Then it might settle but it's still going strong and we are still in contact if not living close and seeing eachother often (a lot of my friendships sometimes become long distance bc of uni/having lived abroad, but this happens with besties who have lived close by too). \n\nBut afterwards comes the dreaded separations, the ghosting, severing of ties.  \n\nAnd it seems no matter what effort I continuously put in, they eventually push away. There's always push back.\n\nNow I know that friendships aren't eternal and often this is a common, natural cycle but this happens to me SO often, and SO regularly and I'm only 22 (F) that I feel like it must be something I'm doing? Like I have lost count of the amount of close one on one as well as group friendships that have gone from 100 - 0.\n\nI did have a reputation at uni as a bit of a liability on a night out and yes I have made dumb mistakes, but nothing I would consider anything major or unforgivable, so I am just trying to understand and hopefully stop this cycle.\n\nSometimes I have a theory that maybe I'm like a fun person to be around, especially on social occasions, but when it gets serious people don't consider me as the confidant, but the fun one so they look elsewhere and get bored of me. I would understand that except I try my best to be open and a good friend, I obviously have more qualities than being 'fun' and I am almost religious about my friendships and maintaining them and when they're good, they're amazing! \n\nBut the inevitable always happens...\n\nI'm just really down about it lately, as I recently graduated and I'm missing my old friends, 70%* of which I don't regularly speak to or not at all anymore. I have 2 really good friends that I speak to every day rn (long distance atm cos after uni), and god only knows my biggest fear is losing them too. \n\nWhen I go to bed I can't help but mourn all the wonderful friendships that slipped away somehow and this sounds so silly but it aches :(\n\nI am sorry if this was a bit long and depressing, but if anyone has any advice on why this always happens to me and how I can stop it, or even rekindle one of my lost friendship soulmates I would be grateful.\n\nDon't hold back, I welcome criticism!\n\n*EDIT: and when I say 70% I really mean 90% lmao", "subreddit": "friendship"}

This depression is real.... \ud83d\ude22", "author": "JustMe282019", "self_text": "Get ready for a long read... \n\nWhere do I even start.... This is so hard for me to write down. I just needed to get this off my chest, I have noone to talk to so this sort of feels like I am confiding in someone. Let me start with how things are right now, at the moment I have never been this depressed in my life. Each day is a real REAL struggle for me. I am currently unable to work due to lack of will power, the heart break I face everyday, waking up and dreading the day ahead. I have recently stopped leaving the house,  I have nothing or nobody in my life to spur me on, to back me up, to be there for me when I need them the most which is right now. I literally *and I mean LITERALLY* have no friends what so ever. I need that girl, my girl, the girl I pick the phone up to everyday and want to talk to about everything. My best friend. I don't have that. Not 1 single girl friend. I need that so much in my life.  The only people in my life right now are my son and my partner, who is impossible to talk to. Even though I have a partner and a child, I still feel trapped and alone. So alone. If you scroll through my messages on my phone, every single one of them if from some rubbish advertisement crap. Lol I know that's weird to say but things like that just remind me of how hard life is for me to do. I sound like a complete melt, a moany, needy idiot who is needing attention. But I have recently realised its OK to say I'm NOT ok. I shouldn't feel ashamed of that. I have had a really difficult upbringing, I was raised as one of Jehovah's Witnesses, a cult that controls your whole life. Hides you away from the world, brainwashes you with complete and utter lies. I wasn't allowed to make friends outside the cult, I was quickly shunned from my whole intire family when I said I don't want to be a JW anymore. My best friends dropped me without a few hours. Friends from babies, my own cousins, glued to the hip best friend. Gone.... and never heard about ever since. I was kept out of school from my parents, I was home schooled through all my high school years until the last year, tensions grew so high between me and my parents. My dad was a Bully. He controlled me mentally and physically. He beat me when we argued, my mum let him. Things were awful, they didn't give me 1 single birthday, not one single Christmas, Easter, Halloween, no GCSE's, no degrees, to qualification. I missed out SO much of my childhood. I feel robbed of that. It hurts alot. The whole high school / college/ uni I missed out on and I could of made life long friends, but I was robbed of that. Since leaving the cult I went off the rails, I did the opposite to everything my parents told me to do. I went OFF. Until I met Steve. He changed my life. He is hilarious, he made me smile. He picked me up when I could of ended up dead.... Until THAT day. The day that changed my whole life once again. The day I got attacked. I don't really want to go into that but let's just say I ended up pregnant without my concent ..... It felt like time stood still for 9 months, my life was upside down. Noone knew except Steve and my sister. This could of been Steve's baby, I was so against abortions at the time and after alot, ALOT of stress I decided to keep him. We had to cross our fingers and hope for the best. Until the day I gave birth. They put my baby on my chest..... My baby wasn't white like me and Steve. I looked up at Steve and saw the world hit him in the face. My baby was gorgeous and I loved him so much but I realised at that moment my life was changed forever. I had to tell the world what happened. I had to explained over and over again why my baby wasn't white. Reminding myself of the worst night of my life on repeat. A very very small amount of people believed me. They all thought because of my past that I was definitely lying. I can never explain the pain of how it feels to go through what I went through and for everyone to look down on me and think I'm spinning a Web of lies. It's the most heart breaking thing I have ever been through. Most days I wanted to end my life there and then. Noone cared about me. Noone believed me. Everyone talked about me. I really needed that one person to hold me and tell me that everything would be OK.... But that's never happened. Since I gave birth I was put on alot of painkillers to help with the pretty dramatic birth of my baby boy. I got addicted. I got relief for just a few hours whilst the pills had kicked in. It helped at the beginning. I started to take them to get rid of the pain I was going through. 7 years later and I'm slowly coming off them. Weaning myself off and I'm nearly done, but I'm so scared to let go. Addiction is really hard. Ever since Leo, I have hidden myself away from the world. I stopped leaving the house. I am constantly angry,  the medication has been in control for the past 7 yrs and I am now a completely different person. I feel rage in my chest. I feel anger towards anything. But the only thing keeping me from not ending everything is my son. My son is my world. My life, my everything. He's such a happy little boy. I adore the bones off of him. But I still feel like the loneliest I have ever felt before. The advise that I have been given is to get out more and go to events and play groups etc. But that type or stuff is my complete worst nightmare. So I literally don't know what to do. I feel like I could write a book about my life. I haven't even scratched the suffice. I guess the post is a cry for help. I know I have to do it all myself but I'm missing that back bone, I'm exhausted all the time, I'm falling apart physically and mentally. I'm scared I'm going to have a nervous breakdown. I guess I'm just asking for help right now and to get this all off my chest and hopefully feel a little better for it.", "subreddit": "Needafriend"}

I like games like minecraft, 7 days to die,  h1zi br, pubg (im really bad at pubg), and some cod games, i just got mw remastered so ive been playing that. I got a ps4 so maybe we can play together. I also really like movies and cartoons, some of my favs are Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas, paranoid park, and the warriors. As for cartoons i love invader zim, spongebob, rockos modern life and king of the hill. I also like drawing and making music. Im kinda quite and it might be awhile before i start having a sense of humor since im kinda shy and have really bad anxeity tbh. I dont have a discord or anything so wed have to chat here, skype or on playstation. Thanks for reading my dumb post, hopefully well be friends.

I can't pour it into my ex because it feels unfair. It feels unfair that I put so much energy into our relationship at the beginning and it wasn't matched back. I wasn't feeling any love from him, which then made me stop showing love and it was hard. Feeling so empty.

It's not that I want him back exactly, although if we could somehow work it out it would be great, it's just I wish he'd put in the effort for me or tell me something..... I legit get no emotional anything from him.\n\nI don't know what I'm doing, but I know I'm hurting myself, I'm giving a man my energy who probably doesn't deserve it all because I want some affection and to give it.\n\nI wish things were different, I wish I wasn't selling myself short for some fake love :(", "subreddit": "Needafriend"}

So in my school, you don\u2019t spend the whole day doing class lessons, sometimes you have these sessions called \u2018independent study\u2019 (basically free periods) where you have to go into one of the schools study rooms to study. Now out of me and my best friends, I am the \u2018social butterfly\u2019 I like talking to everyone and I have quite a few other friends. Now in these independent study sessions, I like to talk to the other friends I have, HOWEVER I can\u2019t even talk to them because BFF2 always bloody wants to sit next to me and it pisses me off. She already sits next to me in lessons and hangs out with me at break time and lunch time so it\u2019s annoying when she follows me even in independent study (sometimes I have to sit with her for 4 hours in independent study and still spend break and lunch with her. I just feel as if I like being friends with BFF1 more, besides the fact that we have consolidated our friendship for so long, she\u2019s also not clingy. If I don\u2019t sit with her sometimes, she just goes her own way and vice versa. However it\u2019s like BFF2 needs to be babysat 24/7 (by the way it\u2019s not like we\u2019re kids we are all 18). I realised how annoyed I was at BFF2 on the day that she didn\u2019t come into school because she was sick. On that glorious day I was able to hang out with all my other friends and make new ones. It made me quite sad because I loved hanging out with them and I knew that as soon as BFF2 came back it would all go away. The thing is that at least BFF1 sometimes wants to socialise with my other friends too which is nice. However BFF2 says \u2018I don\u2019t like them I think they\u2019re bitches\u2019 (she\u2019s never even spoken to them before). I honestly think she\u2019s clingy because she literally has no friends besides me and BFF1 (not even any aquatints she can talk to) but that\u2019s her own fault as she chooses to be unfriendly and act all high and mighty. She even tries to drag me down with her, she telling me to reject my potential boyfriend just because she got rejected by her crush. Even people I don\u2019t talk to tell me that they\u2019ve noticed her clinginess and ask if I\u2019m okay. The thing is that she does cling to BFF1 too but she\u2019s on me like a conjoined twin. \n  \nI know I just bitched about her so hard but overall I think she is a good friend and I wouldn\u2019t want to end out friendship (besides the clinginess she\u2019s one of the bestest friends you could ask for), it\u2019s just that she sticks to me like glue. I can\u2019t even tell her because she\u2019s so emotional. She wouldn\u2019t cry if I called her clingy but she would 110% have watery eyes.", "subreddit": "FriendshipAdvice"}

It got lost or somebody kept it. Not sure. Anyway, we want to do it again!\n\nThis time, we are going about a different approach because of security issues.\n\nSo we thought of something different but still the same idea.\nWe are going to sent around a postcard with a link and password to a google drive file. (Which will be in a sealed envelop)\nIf you want to participate we'll put you on the list and the postcard will eventually be sent to you.\nYou can upload anything you want, a song, your favorite book, a picture, whatever you want.\nGoogle drive has a built in virus scanner. It won't download or share the file if it's infected with malware, so no worries there ;) and the fun thing is, you'll be able to view what other people around the world have been posting, even after you sent the postcard on to the next person (if you write down the password ofcourse)\n\nAnybody who wants in, and find out what other people around the globe are up to, leave us a message!!\n\nEdit: I accidently declined someones chat instead of accepted, if I didn't respond to you within 12 hours it was probably you. Really sorry, please sent me a message again.", "subreddit": "Needafriend"}

But for today, I want to try making friends. \n\nI live in the Triangle, North Carolina. Been watching a fair amount of sadder anime like Clannad and Plastic Memories lately.

Health issues, disabilities, but I've got to learn to start off with things that someone is potentially going to have in common with me or common with what's being experienced now. And starting off with my differences only helps to alienate me further. This is a frustrating mistake i've made over and over in my life, and people get afraid of it. I'm wondering how I can push beyond that. \n\nI'm just sitting here, reflecting a lot. My dreams, where my head's at, what I'm trying to be. and there's this crazy thing I have called Musical Ear Syndrome (MES). I hear music in my head all the time as a result of going deaf earlier in my life. I have CI's now (Cochlear Implants). I've learned though that not everybody with MES experiences as much pleasure and meaning from it as I do. So it feels weird to hear so much varied profound music flowing through my brain constantly and it being so awesome and matching what I experience in life. And other people don't have near as much control over it as I do. So I'm always immersing myself in instrumental stuff. Predominantly, classical jazz, and video game stuff. \n\nSo I hope you're doing great. Let's be friends. I need some good people in my life.", "subreddit": "Needafriend"}

Gemini and INFJ if those help, as well. I can be a bit shy but am working on being better about it - hence this post :D; \n\n\\- I'm an avid foodie and love trying and seeing new things. I love going to farmer's markets, fairs and museums to check things out. I also have a thing for tea blends &lt;3\n\n\\- Watching shows and movies something I really enjoy. I love a lot of animated series' such as Steven Universe, She-Ra., Bojack Horseman and many others but also enjoy a lot of other series' on Netflix. Recently started watching Killing Eve and The Expanse and am pretty open to watching anything really. Also used to be a big weeb but haven't watched anything recently. Fav anime of all time is still FMA: Brotherhood and want to start watching a couple of new shows Ive been seeing around like Demon Slayer, Promised Neverland and Made in Abyss...and I need to eventually finally finish Magus Bride. \n\n\\- I also love video games and currently work on a Fallout 4 fan comic. Currently, I'm playing Sea of Thieves and Monster Hunter and whatever else I can grab on Game Pass. I've also been raising hell playing the Untitled Goose Game that recently came out; it's been kind of cathartic. \n\n\\- I love drawing and doodling and am trying to get back on it. Probably will be taking a class in Illustrator to get a bit better with creating designs for t-shirts and etc. Im hoping I can also eventually get the hang of animation and 3D work.\n\n\\- I love animals and own 3 cats, one of which is currently in NY. I also have a german shepherd. \n\n\\- I met Tommy Wiseau once and it was just as magical as you could imagine it to be.\n\nPlease feel free to hit me up if you'd like to chat.

I lost my mind that day and we had our very first fight that day. Then I stayed at her place and I thought she was angry at me, but then she invited me to her room and while she was on the phone with him, she was making love to me. I thought for sure she left him. The day after she tells me she will not stop talking to him. \n\nShe keeps telling me everything they do together because \"I was always honest with you and I never wanna stop\". She told me we should be close friends and be happy as that. But Everytime she tells me that she met him, she tells me that he kissed her. He lives in the same dormitory as me, so I once listened through the door knob and I even heard it.\n\nI've been losing my mind.

She can't hold down a job for more than two weeks and always blames her inability to afford gas or car payments (refuses to take a bus, or a bike, or walk) blames everyone else in her life for it (her ex, her children, etc.)\n\nWe were great friends once. But now, the only reason she messages me anymore is to ask for money. She never wants to get together, never sends any friendly 'hi how are you's', nothing. I have done my best to reach out to her in a friendly way that doesn't involve the exchange of money. In the last half year, her only reason to talk to me has been to ask for money. It's started to feel quite insulting and I've been more on edge about it the last couple months.\n\nThe most recent time she did this (a couple weeks ago), I didn't reply. I saw her message, but didn't reply.\n\nThen yesterday, out of nowhere, I get a text asking about - what are some great \"insert expensive brand name item here\"? Like... wasn't she just desperate for $20, and $45? and in debt with her whole social network? How can someone with zero money, no job, and a whole lot of debt, children to feed, suddenly want this expensive thing? We're talking like $800 - $2,000.\n\nI replied by giving her a list of less expensive options that are just as good as the expensive brand, based on my own experience with cutting back spending and budgeting.\n\nAnd her reply? \"Lol I mean \\_\\_\\_\\_ brand\". In other words, she isn't willing to spend less, to realize that her financial limitations come with experiential limitations, that responsibility sometimes has to take precedence over fun.\n\nThen I told her I don't know anything about X brand names and she'd be better off looking at consignment sites.\n\nAll she said was a quick: k thanks.\n\nAnd the conversation ended there.\n\nHow can she ask me for grocery and gas money, and then turn around and express interest in spending thousands of dollars on something frivolous, the obtaining of which would cause her even more trouble than she's already in? Does she think that getting encouragement from me to spend lots of money will justify her asking me for more money in the future? Because I encouraged her into even more debt?\n\nI can't be friends with her anymore! I am so done with this bullshit.", "subreddit": "friendship"}

(Hes 33, she\u2019s 26, I\u2019m 29)\n\nI\u2019m single and they know it. Yet most of the time around me they had to hold hands, kiss, touch each other romantically and more. We would be at the beach, I look over and she\u2019s just feeling up his arm, trying to kiss him. Other times I look over and they\u2019re just being all lovey-dovey and shit. \n\nI would mention the PDA bothered me but they would say \u201cit\u2019s not my fault\u201d and she would laugh. That alone would\u2019ve normally caused me to excuse myself from being the 3rd wheel and hanging out with other people. But I can\u2019t do that since they\u2019re riding and staying with me. Ugh! \n\nI spent everyday for 7 days driving them around LA. Sure my best friend payed for gas and some of my food; but his gf had to \u201crun the show\u201d. Both myself and her boyfriend knew she had to see Hollywood because it\u2019s iconic. \n\nI drive out to Hollywood through all the fu**ing traffic and I say to my friend, \u201clet\u2019s park the car and walk by the Chinese theater and soak in the environment.\u201d \n\nSHE, sitting in the backseat of my car while on her phone says \u201cugh. I don\u2019t want to walk\u201d ... I look back (frustrated and hiding it as best I can) and ask her \u201cwhy don\u2019t you want to walk?\u201d She kept looking down at her phone, avoiding eye contact and says \u201cI don\u2019t like walking through crowds\u201d - at that moment I was sooooo upset. Trying to keep my cool, I say \u201cif you don\u2019t want to be around crowds, then go visit Idaho\u201d \n\nShe knew damn well that LA is a God damn crowded city. It\u2019s the 2nd most populated in the United States!! Her boyfriend, my best friend, this was his 3rd time visiting LA and he loves it. \n\nI stopped listening to her complain. She would try to argue and bicker with me, but I would stop myself because it\u2019s their vacation and I know I could ruin it by EASILY saying the wrong thing or by being extremely confrontational like mentioning... they literally do not have the funds to stay at a hotel, so they stayed in the living room of my 1 bedroom apartment. Completely free. I even took off from work for them. \n\nShe keeps mentioning \u201cnext time\u201d she visits LA and if/when that happens she sure as hell ain\u2019t staying at my place, even if she\u2019s with my best friend.

It doesn't matter what it is, be it love, friendship, or a discord community .\"Sic Parvis Magna\" - Greatness from small beginnings. This discord intends to stay smaller (think: 30-40 people) with an emphasis on building long lasting relationships with people who are not only like-minded, but share an interest in genuinely connecting over time. If you're just passing through, this discord won't be ideal for you. We cannot promise you will meet girls/guys here who you will click with if that's also what you're looking for. Hopefully you're somebody who wants to make real friends, eventually meet up, talk everyday, etc. all that stuff.\n\nThe current members of the discord are from another discord, we know each other very well. What does this mean for you? Well, it means not only do we have this type of experience, but we will also do our best to connect with you. This means if you're a shy type, we don't care. Extrovert? Great, you'll fit right in. Some of us play games, some do not, this is definitely not that type of discord.\n\nSince we're talking about creating connections with people, we do expect you to be not only real, honest, but we hope that you are willing to voice as well. Why? Real connections occur when real effort is put out. Text is great, and often times we can only text, but we want to get to know you. Talking over voice is a good way to do this, and I believe that it's the only way to get really close to somebody.\n\nThis discord is very small currently, you will be here at the beginning (and hopefully) for a long time. If you're looking for a very active discord, this is not that currently, though eventually it will be. If you're looking for good friends, chattin shit, banter and finding people long term to talk to, meet, etc, this is for you.\n\nSome things about the people in here: We banter, a lot. We make dark jokes, we typically don't view things as sacred bar certain topics, we definitely expect you not to bully people, and we expect you to put actual effort in to creating connections as it's the whole point of this discord.\n\nIdeally you are: Genuine, can banter, will not disappear (if we see a lack of effort we will simply remove you.), would like to voice, not an internet personality, etc.\n\nplease PM me if you're interested, thanks.", "subreddit": "Needafriend"}

I only agreed to them moving it in because my ex-bestfriend said they would make a great roommate and help with bills. Drove 3 states over (never doing that again) to move all their stuff in and I did bought all the food and amenities they couldn't bring. They stayed in their room a lot, only coming out to eat and that was fine I thought they were getting used to it here. I noticed my ex-bestfriend and them talked a lot with discord, we all hung out in a server and I knew how they called eachother and such. I then noticed my he hadn't messaged me nearly as much as normal, I thought he was busy with work or something of the like.  \n\nA week goes by then on the 4th of july roommate tells me they are moving in with my ex-bestfriend, tommorow. I was furious, I asked him what he was doing. I used a fair amount of language, this whole moving in cost me quite a lot and the rent had to increase, but I never got a response. Next day he came and helped them move their stuff out, he never once looked at me. Now ex-roommate tells me not to be mad at him, because \"hes hurting too\" and that they would chat me up when they arrived. I was then banned from our mutual servers and blocked on all mutual games we ever played, though I did not know that until about a week after. Later that day I had a mild heart attack because of how terrible I was feeling and he knew but never once asked if I was okay. It's been over 2 months of silence now, and I don't know what to do here. He was my best friend for almost 13 years, we talked in voice chats near daily but now I just have no clue what to do. His lack of response to me makes me think he wanted me to go through the trouble of moving them in so he could have them as a girlfriend, and the exroommate has show zero remorse and still tries talking to me every few days telling me \"how bad he feels\". \n\ntldr: I feel like I was used and discarded by a best friend.", "subreddit": "FriendshipAdvice"}

Before the guy who was apologising to me there was other. My other best friend was kissed by her, and you know the rest.\n\nThis time I didn't feel anything. I just told her it's ok, she hugged me and it felt good. Right now I miss her. My ex tells me she still loves me, I love her too, it's hard not to since we've been dating for 3 years.

I have 2 kitties and 2 super cute pups &amp; I'm a big animal lover. I'm into PC gaming, being a hermit and nomming food while watching junk on TV, chillin' with a PHAT glass of wine, dressing up my animals even tho they despise it, and hitting that juul bro. I have a dark sense of humor so it's pretty hard to offend me. I'm 3 months into a weight-loss journey and always looking for an accountability buddy! Tattoos are rad and I'm wanting a ton more, same with piercings. I'm atheist but the religion of others is no concern of mine, to each their own.

I love watching movies with others if my heckin awful internet allows it. Bonus points if you live close and want to hangout (no car atm tho \ud83d\ude2d) I'm always down for a smoke sesh, mixed drinks, and a movie night. I love fun co-op games such as Human Fall Flat, or mmos like FFXIV (which my current net can't handle atm so on hiatus). Still hoping for an FFXI Classic. \n\nI love period pieces, and learning about history through research or historical drama shows i.e Versailles, Tudors, Victoria, Mary Queen of Scots. I love the amazing architecture of those ages and I was ENTHRALLED when I got to visit the Biltmore house in Asheville, NC. Visiting the Palace of Versailles is on my bucket list for sure. \n\nI binge watch a ton of Twitch, Netflix, Hulu, etc and always down to binge something with a new pal.

I have no enemies or problems with people because I keep to myself. There is this one person and she was cool at the beginning. But as time went by it seems like work has gotten to her and her whole attitude change. Kinda like when you work too much and you stress. Or have lots of things on your plate. I don\u2019t know but now I feel like a negative vibe coming from her. The way she talks and looks. One time I left my keys at home. She was outside my apartment building and she told me she don\u2019t have the key to my building. I mean I found that odd because it\u2019s her job to have keys for the building she works and cleans in it. But I never made it a big deal. I didn\u2019t care really. Then the other time I would say good morning and she would respond with good morning back and just walk away rudely. So a few days later I asked her what was wrong she looks tired and exhausted and I noticed something was wrong and she apologized and said she was having a bad day and she apologized and said she appreciate me asking how she\u2019s doing because that brightens her day. Something to that affect.  Then today she seemed like she had a attitude and that\u2019s when I finally realized I need to stop being so nice to people. The only thing me and her were discussing in the past was someone who I know and that person was taking advantage of her and being dishonest and I wanted to warn her from looking dumb and being taken advantage of. I feel like even if you do the right things nothing will come out of it. At this point I don\u2019t even care to ask her what\u2019s her problem but I do feel like we are both adults and we should discuss the real reasons why she\u2019s been having a attitude with me. The truth is vibes don\u2019t lie. And when you feel bad vibes coming from someone then it\u2019s a bad thing.

My idea of friendship has always seemed different from other people (as though more in line with the concept of a Best Friend, I suppose), which has lead to me having a hard time feeling like I connect with people a lot of the time. I understand that friendships aren't easy, and that \"best friends\" don't happen over night. \n\nI'm naturally shy, I got bullied a lot a child for numerous reasons, don't think much of myself, and am generally just very reserved and personal (though how much of that is natural and how much is a result of being shy/getting bullied I can't really know). These things all make it very difficult for me to open up to people, and it usually takes a few months to get comfortable enough around new people to do so. It's usually right around, or shortly after, I start opening up that it feels like people start to disappear. \n\nFor example: I can spend 5 or 6 months getting comfortable around someone, talking frequently (sometimes every day) with them about interests, hobbies, music preferences, and so on. Sometimes conversations get even more personal, but then it just seems to hit a brick wall at some point. They'll slow down on, or outright stop, initiating conversations with me. I start getting shorter and shorter replies from them when I initiate conversation, leaving it feeling like they just don't want to talk to me any more - like they're replying out of courtesy or obligation, rather than any real desire to, and are just hoping I'll \"take the hint\" and stop. Asking to see if anything is wrong, or whether I've done anything to anger or annoy them, are met with \"I'm fine\", \"No, you're fine\", or similar style responses with no follow up. Trying to press the issue further, since I still end up feeling like something is wrong, usually just turns in to them getting angry at me, telling me they don't want to talk about it, etc. If I try to express my feelings about the situation, I get brushed off with things like \"We'll deal with that later\". \n\nI've always had the idea/belief that friends were people that you felt comfortable talking to, or sharing with. That you could talk about anything with. That the above scenario, and others like it, seem to keep happening time and time again just leave me wondering if I really understand friendship at all, though.  \n\n\nTo be clear: I understand that problems or changes can come up in the other person's life, which might be stressing them out or causing them other issues that they need to deal with, and that it might not actually be me. It still makes me question things though, because again - there's that idea/belief that friends were people that you felt comfortable talking to, or sharing with, and they just don't seem to be able to do that with me.\n\nThanks for taking the time to read this, whether or not you have any insight or desire to reply.", "subreddit": "FriendshipAdvice"}

Turns out hes married and they decided to continue the relationship when they got home. He lives in a totally different state but they still see each other (they fly out to see each other every month). Well not only is he married hes older than her and has kids. This past time he showed up at her door unannounced and stayed for 2 weeks. I thought this was a little odd but she is so in love with this guy she doesnt see the harm. \n\nI thought this wasnt going anywhere at first because of the distance and the fact that hes married but this last time he told her he told his wife everything and that he is leaving her. I see red flags and feel like this just wont end well. I really dont see how hes going to move to another state away from his kids just to be with her. She wont move because she just bought a house 2 years ago. At first he told her he didnt believe in divorce so i really didnt think it was going anywhere but now who knows. \n\nAnyway, my boyfriend knows because I couldnt keep this a secret from him. We are supposed to be going over tonight for game night but hes saying he doesnt want to see her because she is a home wrecker and lost all respect for her. I agree but weve been friends for so long and I really enjoy hanging out with her and I dont have many friends left in the area as they have all moved to different states all except her. I just dont know what to do because I feel the same way he does but I dont want to stop hanging out with her as I said before.

I had trash piled up and was getting a trash route turned on but needed the excess bags hauled off. We came up with a plan to burn it but after a few weeks of complaining and her being at my home everyday she kept offering to help because she had a truck. We was going to take it a half a mile down the road and I was giving her 20 in gas. I didn't want to be a bother and she had been offering for weeks to help me but being stubborn and not wanting to owe her I kept refusing. Finally I took her up on the offer so she and her family came up. As soon as her son hops out of the truck he asks if my husband was fired which I thought was weird and she excused him saying they had noticed my husband had been off a few days in a row. I told them no and we commenced to loading the trash and taking it to her place. As we were unloading to burn she tells me they have loved at her place for 6 months and haven't ever used their route so they had trash in several trucks on their lot that had to be hauled off and to just throw mine in. I said no but she insisted it was easier than burning it since her mother already paid to have it hauled off. I asked if she was sure and if it was ok and she said yes I agreed to give her the twenty the next day and I left. 2 hours later her mother calls me and says I should have asked her although her 27 year old daughter said it was fine and since she was laying to have it hauled off I owed half for two truckloads. 1 they had a ton of trash and my two loads was not half of 100 and 2 I told her I didn't have it as I explained for weeks to her daughter and that I would come to pick it back up or help them burn it all even theirs. She refused saying she already payed and I was going to give her half and hung up my friend later calls me to tell me how messed up I am for not helping her mom who is footing the bill. I feel deceived because I was clear on my part and my situation and feel if she offered for me to load the trash there she should have made sure it was ok first exp since I asked.

When were younger she had drama then too, but a lot of us did at the time. Now we\u2019re grown and I noticed that she was doing the SAME things and inviting all this drama into her life, but also mine. Initially I just told her I needed space and would go weeks without hanging out. I enjoyed that time away so much but of course I missed her and would always want to meet or catch up. The more time I spent away the more I noticed she had a problem with it. She always made little jabs here and there saying things like \u201cyou wouldn\u2019t understand how funny it was because you weren\u2019t there,\u201d or \u201cnah we didn\u2019t miss you at the dinner last week haha.\u201d Another friend of mine would tell me that she would drone on and on about me about how absent I was and that she can\u2019t go to me for advice anymore. I would ask her about this and she\u2019d deny it and say we were on good terms. \nThe funny thing is, I explained to her that I was tired of being around our big friend group because it\u2019s just a lot of energy all the time and all we did is drink and go out. I was really just trying to set some boundaries for myself because I got to a point where I was so uncomfortable whenever we hung out. I started noticing my toxic traits and wanted to work on them as well. I thought things were good until New Year\u2019s Day. \nShe got really hysterical and told me she had been keeping a secret from me. The secret ended up being super dumb but I hated that she kept it from me because I\u2019m always so loud about just being honest even if it hurts. She had all of our other friends keep the secret for her. I felt so stupid. I guess you could say I hate being the last to know things. But I told her that day that I\u2019m so over this drama and this is one of the reasons I haven\u2019t been hanging out as much. All of this is silly and then I left. We didn\u2019t speak for a few days but when we did I told her ALL the reasons I was staying away. I said she always had drama, she was manipulative, passive aggressive, made a lot of situations about her....the list goes on. She kept saying she felt the same way about me and how much she\u2019s hurting and so on. Then she asks me what she specifically did to me. I name a few things like how she didn\u2019t care about my feelings  (a past issue) and the whole unnecessary secret thing and making everyone agree to it ( I was upset at everyone else too.) Anyway this is where I\u2019m not sure if I made the right decision sort of...because she hasn\u2019t done anything reoccurring to me really but she has with others and it bothers me. I really do question her character. Obviously this was mooonnths ago and we rarely talk..like only thru text and we\u2019ve attempted to meet up and hash things out but she blows me off every time even if she initiates the convo. Recently, I\u2019ve deleted/unfollowed her off of social media I guess to make it official. \nI often doubt how I\u2019m feeling at times and don\u2019t ever want to make impulsive decisions which Is why I guess I wrote all of this. Do y\u2019all think I made the right choice?? If so/if not what would you do/have done? \n\nTL:DR: I broke up with my best friend who has a lot of drama but hasn\u2019t done much specifically to me but I question her character often.

She has had more jobs then me I'm still struggling to get one, They get more support then I do honestly with finding jobs cause if they don't like something they get a new one right away. It's not right but anyways moving on so she tends to bring up when I first meet you I didn't really like you at first what did you think about us? I said I liked you guys, is that weird to say? I think so, and then recently not to long ago a few months ago we had our stupid first argument over money she said her treat for lunch and she treated her husband and me to a big pizza, and I said I'll pay you back she said no your fine my treat, and then I said okay that was nice of you.\n\nLater on that she decided to call my sister since both my parents are no longer alive, and she is my legal attorney and she gets along with her to, cause we all did stuff together also my sister has took us places and them and invited them along and so on and she called and said we really like her but we can't be spending our money on her all the time, she owes us $7.00 and I had money but she said my treat and my sister did get on them for saying my treat cause you don't have to pay someone back if they say that and or holler for it a later time.\n\nSo I had to say what I had to say and my sister did good to, she knows them well also, and then later on she texted me the friend and said we can't hang out all the time once a month is good, and when we do bring your own money, and get stuff which I do anyhow lol and also I'm the type to get my own stuff anyways so my sister didn't like at all what she said after she got off the phone with her.  So apparently we both apologized I paid her stupid seven bucks back, and then she goes I don't wanna argue no more, that was stupid and so on and so on that was our first argument but look what it was over money.\n\nSo we still hang out till this day and all but then she wants me to hang out with her for her own sake cause is this right to do? Well tomorrow she wants me to hang out with her so she can get her nails done so I usually do and wait and wait and till they get there things done, and that's not hanging out is it? Someone she just wants being there, and also like when we went to the mall the other day it was cause of her she had to pay her bills off I just go cause of kindness? Is this really a friend even with what she has done in the past? and like tonight the group we go to had a pizza and a movie and free and we where planning to walk to it, and she goes I'm tired I work all day, and her husband called me earlier in the day and to talk about his movies that he got in the mail, big deal and he also likes to pick on me but yeah so I don't answer half the time and then she calls later on and said when are you going to answer him never? she gets pissed like also before when I said I'll get you something for your birthday I treat you to lunch or something treat him to I only have money for you not him also.", "subreddit": "friendship"}

I\u2019m a 25 year old girl (woman? Idk) with social anxiety, generalized anxiety, major depression and borderline personality disorder (BPD). If you know anything about bpd, you know that we can\u2019t hold down relationships for jack shit. My old friends all ended up in me blowing up on the person over something small and me refusing to talk to them over anger. Behind the anger is a lot of hurt ... a lot of low self esteem and low self worth, and a lot of ideology that I am worth very little to anyone in the world .... It\u2019s been a few years since I\u2019ve had friends, but I was in therapy long term (until my therapist went on maternity leave) and i\u2019ve been on new meds to help. I\u2019m trying my best to work on myself as a person, to make sure that I am a better person before I try to get friends again ... I don\u2019t want to blow up on people anymore, but sometimes I feel like I get out of control and really mean ... A big part of the reason that I\u2019ve isolated myself over the years (I never go out except for work, I work two jobs to keep myself busy and productive, I always make up excuses for when co workers invite me out, I don\u2019t actually have any friends ....) is because i\u2019m so afraid of what I will do to someone that is unfortunate enough to become my friend .... I don\u2019t know. I\u2019m not doing a good job of selling myself as a friend right now, but i\u2019ve just been so lonely for so long, it just physically aches in my chest.

Sometimes she would criticize something i enjoyed, whether it be a show or video game (i tend to hyperfixate on various things, so i understand how it can seem annoying, but it really brings me comfort due to my anxiety). i also felt like i shouldn\u2019t be her personal therapist, because she would vent to me but in return make me feel like shit if i ever opened up to her. but i tend to gloss over all our fun times as friends. we both loved marvel, and as kids we would pretend we were superheroes. we also loved vintage shows and i remember one time when we stayed up all night watching the old batman episodes on halloween. as a scared kid, she was always there for me when something was too much, but she also helped me gain confidence. she was the first one i came out to when i started to think i was gay. she was super nice about it and i think that was really something i needed when i was getting increasingly depressed. looking back, i definitely could\u2019ve been nicer, as sometimes i would snap at her or just be clearly angry when it wasn\u2019t her fault that i was really stressed. Since there\u2019s a ton of pros and cons, i just need to let it settle once and for all. should i try and reach out and make things right, or should i just \u201clet sleeping dogs lie?\u201d \nTLDR: I really want to make things right with a friend who wronged me (but I also wronged in return), but i\u2019m not sure if it\u2019s the best thing to do.", "subreddit": "FriendshipAdvice"}

We\u2019re both girls.  Anyway, one time we stayed the weekend at some guys house and got super drunk one night. I\u2019ll call my friend Ally  (not her real name), the guy Jason and his cousin Allen. Anyway, I remember I didn\u2019t eat much that day but was drinking a lot because I was sad over a failed relationship. It was the day after Christmas and there was a lot of family drama. Anyway, I\u2019m almost certain Jason drugged me. Possibly my friend too. Probably. There\u2019s stuff she doesn\u2019t remember unless she\u2019s just lying. Anyway, after he gave me a  beer, which he opened up himself and offered me after ally told me to stop drinking the moonshine bc I was drinking it like juice and not sipping like she said,  and I was already plastered \u2026 I then passed out and kept waking up to throw up. I was projectile vomiting. She cleaned me up.  Anyway, I remember waking up and ally was whispering stuff to Jason. I\u2019m not sure what. She told me she told Jason that I was a Virgin so Allen wouldn\u2019t suspect sex. I did have a situation where I was drunk and things did get pretty bad but could have gotten  worse because some guy was expecting sex. Anyway, it didn\u2019t appear she was talking about anything of concern. I remember after waking up we were both totally sobered out. She kept asking me to join her In Bed with Jason (her fuckbuddy). I felt uneasy but eventually just went in. It was weird because he touched my leg then she got mad and just left and slept in her car. It\u2019s possible she was mad at me but idk she invited me there and Knew he was super into me being a Virgin and that he was flirting with me. She said she was mad at him for trying to have sex with me bc she told him not to. He told me she wanted a threesome. I told her and she said she didn\u2019t but that he was pressuring her. Anyway, one day Allen told me how Jason was telling him to do stuff to me while I was passed out. I asked my friend ally because I didn\u2019t trust him and she said he didn\u2019t. After I was done hanging out with Jason she finally told me Jason was talking about doing stuff to me since I was passed out and that he was telling Allen to as well. She insisted she didn\u2019t remember and didn\u2019t want to accuse and that she barely remembered it. She looked out for me so many times in the past so I\u2019m super confused. Do you think maybe she felt to blame for saying stuff ? Or maybe did something and doesn\u2019t wanna tell me and felt like maybe she turned him on ? And that\u2019s why she didn\u2019t take it seriously? Also if she did do something \u2026 think it was anything graphic? Her groping  me while I\u2019m passed out is creepy but it\u2019s different than like fingering me or doing something oral. She has acted weird towards me in the past but idk if it\u2019s anything. What do you guys think happened \u2026 ? Also if she was drugged too it can make you more promiscuous. Also I think it\u2019s important to note that after that ally never talked to Jason \u2026 ever again", "subreddit": "FriendshipAdvice"}

She was really sweet, and we got along really well. All through Freshman and Sophomore year things were great, until that summer. We are both artists, and we both create original characters. She started to...subtly accuse me of copying her. Keep in mind that this girl had at least 400 oc\u2019s at the time, and I\u2019m okay familiar with 3. And she\u2019s constantly adding to the pile. She would accuse me over the smallest trait on a character, and at that point it was near impossible to give your character a trait that one of hers did not have. And it\u2019s all just fiction, right? No harm done. But she would get so heated about this. She would go into these quiet angry phases while we were in the same room. But things really came to a head when I invited her on my annual vacation to Florida. This year we were going to universal studios, which was a special occasion, I hadn\u2019t been since I was 12. \nShe got angry because I dyed my hair burgundy, which she already was upset about. I made an off comment about wanting a more purple tone next time around. That pissed her off. Just so happens her most prized oc has purple hair. Not the purple I wanted, even. A very bright, vibrant one, while I wanted a color much darker. She threw a fit, two fits, actually, about this. \nShe twisted things around when we fought and told my mother only the things I had down, and not that she was the one that caused it. After my mom threatened to ground me for one of these twisted events did I take her out onto the porch of the hotel room and closed the door so I could tell her about everything that\u2019s happened and that I don\u2019t know where it went wrong. She picked fights with me the entire time we were in universal. We eventually just passed it off as it just being us both on our times of the month and we were just angry.\nBut then she did it again. \nThere was another event I will not get into because it is very personal, but she essentially tried to say my father wasn\u2019t a bad person because he buys me things and I shouldn\u2019t be upset he won\u2019t let me get properly medicated for the anxiety I\u2019ve been diagnosed with or diagnosed for the bipolar disorder I\u2019m sure I have, because he doesn\u2019t think it\u2019s real and that it\u2019s a scam. \nBut that\u2019s all I\u2019ll say on that.\nFirst day of school, junior year, my current year. I bought converse for the new year, her shoe choice was converse. Not even the same color. She threw a fit at me, because I was trying to replace her. She \u201ccaught\u201d me listening to a song she associates with her holy purple haired oc that everyone seems to want to steal from her. I told her \u201cdude I love this song it\u2019s been in my library for years.\u201d But she didn\u2019t believe me because I was drawing purple oc for her, and asked for a list of songs, like a playlist for that character, and that song was on her list. \nShe got pissed at me for wearing leggings. \nAnother time, just conversing about characters and guess what? Turns out both of our stories have a very similar trope for world building! One that\u2019s even used in the Bible! She got pissed, told me, and I quote \u201cyou know, our stories are very similar, but don\u2019t say I think you\u2019re copying me because I know you just love to put words in my mouth\u201d\nI tried to restart with her, because she loves to preach forgive and forget. Asked her \u201cwhy not we just start over and see how we end up?\u201d\nShe doesn\u2019t even give a proper response, instantly jumps into \u201cso now you wanna forgive and forget?\u201d\nBecause I always did, that\u2019s why I\u2019m still friends with her, because every single time she\u2019s just \u201cgoing through some stuff.\u201d Apparently I made her this way, by making her feel so horrible because I simply told her she was being rude when she obviously was. \nSo, I\u2019m not exactly sure what to do. \nMy parents see her as a third child, except my mom, who I told about the shit she\u2019s pulled. She\u2019s like a sister to me, but I\u2019m not sure I can take this anymore. She\u2019s resorted to avoiding me, and makes a very dramatic point of stopping in her tracks when I\u2019m on my way to lunch and hatefully glaring at me until I go into the building. \nSome advice would be appreciated, do I drop her or do I keep her?", "subreddit": "FriendshipAdvice"}

I\u2019d prefer a female buddy, since I\u2019m in a relationship and don\u2019t want my boyfriend feeling insecure. I know he\u2019d most likely be totally fine if it was a guy, but deep down I\u2019m sure he\u2019d feel a little jealousy too, which I don\u2019t want him to ever have to feel. \n\nDue to mental health and some dark times/ situations getting in the way during my early 20s, I lost lot of people I thought were good friends. I have two friends now, we catch up sometimes. But I haven\u2019t felt I could truly vent and be open about things that go on in my life to them until I met my boyfriend. He deals with it, but I can tell he just wishes I had a friend to talk to about certain things sometimes haha. My friends are poles apart with things I\u2019m interested in too, I\u2019m a homebody, introverted, and rather stay home playing video games or watching anime. One friend is a party animal and the other enjoys everything outdoors, but they\u2019re amazing girls so I still enjoy their company and friendship. My boyfriend on the other hand has the same interests, so he\u2019s like my best friend and lover in that regard. \n\nSome things about me: \n\n- I love me some Pewds. I\u2019m a massive anime fan, I have a huge embarrassing collection of figurines. I\u2019m obsessed with Japan, and studying a degree in Japanese, so I have a lot of childish kawaii things all over the place. But the biggest thing for me is my intense love for the Legend of Zelda franchise. I. Am. Obsessed. I have been since I was a kid.\n\n- I\u2019m definitely a left-winger in how I think about the world. I grew up in a Catholic household so I still hold some religious views and respect the teachings of Jesus, but damn do I love me some Jesus memes. I wholeheartedly believe in science, so I can\u2019t deal with the beliefs of anti-vaxxers, climate change-deniers or flat-earthers, to name a few. But I do love a good conspiracy discussion.\n\n- [Trigger Warning] I grew up with two very mentally-ill parents. With one of them being abusive and causing me to lose a lot of my childhood years due to having to grow up early and try be a good role model for my younger siblings. I had intense therapy for major depressive disorder, PTSD and anxiety. I\u2019m still on medication and have bad days every so often, but I\u2019m doing a lot better. I was bullied a lot in my life, even after I graduated school. During my early 20s, I was raped, and was a heavy drug user. I was very depressed and self harmed relentlessly. I also used to smoke weed everyday, but can now have a joint every so often without getting addicted, which is awesome. \n\nSo, if you have similar interests, pasts, world-views - give me a message or comment :) I\u2019m coming to Reddit for this, since I\u2019m so addicted to this place I\u2019m hopeful I\u2019d meet some like-minded Redditors.", "subreddit": "Needafriend"}

It doesn't matter what it is, be it love, friendship, or a discord community .\"Sic Parvis Magna\" - Greatness from small beginnings. This discord intends to stay smaller (think: 30-40 people) with an emphasis on building long lasting relationships with people who are not only like-minded, but share an interest in genuinely connecting over time. If you're just passing through, this discord won't be ideal for you. We cannot promise you will meet girls/guys here who you will click with if that's also what you're looking for. Hopefully you're somebody who wants to make real friends, eventually meet up, talk everyday, etc. all that stuff.\n\nThe current members of the discord are from another discord, we know each other very well. What does this mean for you? Well, it means not only do we have this type of experience, but we will also do our best to connect with you. This means if you're a shy type, we don't care. Extrovert? Great, you'll fit right in. Some of us play games, some do not, this is definitely not that type of discord. Since we're talking about creating connections with people, we do expect you to be not only real, honest, but we hope that you are willing to voice as well. Why? Real connections occur when real effort is put out. Text is great, and often times we can only text, but we want to get to know you. Talking over voice is a good way to do this, and I believe that it's the only way to get really close to somebody.\n\nThis discord is very small currently, you will be here at the beginning (and hopefully) for a long time. If you're looking for a very active discord, this is not that currently, though eventually it will be. If you're looking for good friends, chattin shit, banter and finding people long term to talk to, meet, etc, this is for you. Some things about the people in here: We banter, a lot. We make dark jokes, we typically don't view things as sacred bar certain topics, we definitely expect you not to bully people, and we expect you to put actual effort in to creating connections as it's the whole point of this discord. Ideally you are: Genuine, can banter, will not disappear (if we see a lack of effort we will simply remove you.), would like to voice, not an internet personality, etc.\n\nplease PM me if you're interested, thanks.", "subreddit": "Needafriend"}

In public I sadly don't have many friends and most of my friends are on here from Reddit. They have been so awesome and nice and I can't thank them enough.  I was hoping I can make friends with more people like that. Don't worry about those I'm already talking with I will still talk with you. Just trying to expand my friends list. \n\nI graduated from college with a degree in film mostly focusing on editing. I suffer from both anxiety and depression. It effects me a lot on day to day basis mostly depression. Some days I'm fine Some I'm not. So if I complain about being depressed please understand I can't control it and at least be sympathetic towards it.\n\nI'm somewhere on the autism spectrum. Its not as severe as other people probably. Like you wouldn't think i have It because I'm on the high functioning side of the spectrum. However my social skills are really bad which makes it difficult to make friends in real life. \n\nI can be very shy, lonely and boring person. I have a hard time making conversation so I might be boring to talk to at times. I will try my best not to. I don't have much in my life. The good news Is that I'm getting better but, still have tough time making conversation.\n\nIn terms of Hobbies. My favorite stuff to do is watch movies or tv shows. Some of my favorite movies are The Dark Knight, Goodfellas, Taxi Driver, Pulp Fiction, and Apocalypse Now. Some of my favorite tv shows currently are Big Little Lies, The Handmaid's Tale, Black Mirror, Stranger Things, Westworld, Rick and Morty, American Horror Story, Barry and The Marvelous Mrs Maisel. However I watch a lot of other movies and shows as well. I'm also big Fan of Star Wars, Game of Thrones, and Marvel. So feel free to give me suggestions on movies or shows to watch\n\nI love animals particularly Dogs and hamsters. Huskies are my favorite breed but I also love bulldogs. Sadly I don't have a dog or any pet but, would love one in the future. \n\nI'm a big WWE fan or at least try to watch what I can. Been watching since 2006. So if you like WWE that would be awesome. \n\nI love rock music from the 70s-90. My favorite bands are (AC/DC, Aerosmith, Bon Jovi, Def Leppard, Guns N Roses, Kiss, Metallica, and Queen). \n\nOther things I like are to learn about history, conspiracy theories/mysteries even though I don't believe most of them, Memes, and Sports (particular baseball/American football) \n\nSo yeah feel free to message me if any of these things interest you \ud83d\ude03. If you going to message me I recommend you being around my age at least 19-27. Nobody younger or older to chat with cause I feel it would be awkward lol. I can make some exceptions. \n\nImportant, don't bother sending me a message if your just going to ghost. It really hurts and I don't like doing that either to others unless we don't connect or something. Also I  don't like when a conversation fizzles out and I don't ever hear from you again. It's fine if your forgot to respond but, I usually think if it fizzles out and you never get back to me. That you don't care to talk again. \n\nDon't care what gender just want friends who share interests to talk. I have Whatsapp, Snapchat and, Discord but I want to keep the conversation on Reddit for now. Until we get to know each other more. I prefer the pm message box and not the chat but whatever works for you. So yeah just msg me your age, gender, and a little bit about yourself so I know you read all this lol.", "subreddit": "Needafriend"}

I don't do this all the time, though, I do generally help my friends, it just seems like when it doesn't suit me or 'I can't be bothered' i'll blow them off.\n\nAn example of this happened today. A friend of mine needed help finding her cat, who has been missing for two days, and although I knew fully well how much she loves her cats I didn't find the urge to help her at all; I knew I should help, and I felt guilty that I didn't want too, that I shouldn't ignore her or give an excuse just because I didn't want too ( I was also in some pain but it's definitely something I could have had some painkillers for and been fine), and that I only didn't want to help her because otherwise I knew my whole day was free to do ... well ... nothing; and yet I didn't help her.\n\nTo add to this, I know I'm a lazy person. I often don't do things because I'm lazy, and I know that part of the reason I didn't help her was because I was being lazy; but now, it's really starting to bother me. I can see how it's negatively affecting my friendships, and I can see how people are becoming annoyed and angry at me, which they have full rights to be, but I just have no idea where to start on fixing this?\n\nOtherwise, I am usually a very empathetic person; but I just can't help but feel like something is wrong with me in the way that sometimes I just honestly don't care, I've even caught myself in my head saying 'I don't care' to situations, and how it's leaning on being borderline apathetic? It's like sometimes I don't understand why I should care?\n\nDoes anyone have any thoughts on how I could fix this? do I need to see a therapist or something?

She manically tries to change her appearance and goals in order to feel more worthy of these unavailable men wanting her. \n\nShe is all over the place. \nSometimes she says she is going to forget about him and focus on her goals. \nOther days she\u2019s obsessed about if he\u2019s having sex with his girlfriend and it controls her for 24 hours strait . \nOther days she\u2019s saying she is going to work on her goals and send her female energy towards him so he likes her. \nShe will read books and YouTube videos  on breakups. As if she\u2019s truly going through one or like she\u2019s having a rough patch with a boyfriend\ud83d\ude33\ud83d\ude33\ud83d\ude33\ud83d\ude33\n\nshe is 100% convinced he likes her and he just doesn\u2019t have the guts to tell her \ud83d\ude44 she is dead set on finding a way to get him alone (as he won\u2019t meet with her outside work lol) and convince him she\u2019s a catch and he\u2019s missing out. \n\nShe has a bogus life coach who tells her to kiss him. And she actually did kiss him recently. And now he ignores her and is being mean. I assume this is to make her back off. She thinks he\u2019s playing hard to get....\n\nWhen she does this with men, I can\u2019t really talk to her at all. She\u2019s delusional. But she will attack me and say that she knows who she is and she\u2019s got goals and her shit together and blah blah. One time I blocked her for 2 years lol. \n\nI\u2019m concerned not because she probably has a slim chance of getting pregnant which is a huge goal of hers BUT BECAUSE SHES OVER 40 and living in fantasy!!!\n\nAll I can tell her is the truth and the cold hard facts. Nothin works. \nGlad I\u2019m not her I guess", "subreddit": "FriendshipAdvice"}

I\u2019m a very cool adventurous person that likes to make money and travel. Although she\u2019s friends with my DH exes and girls I had confrontation with, I said sure we can see if we bond. We\u2019ve went a couple places together, took the kids out and even joined family functions together. She lost a relationship with her best friend, my cousin was cheating on her and her mom passed a few months back. I haven\u2019t heard anything from her in a couple weeks but she hit me Friday asking was my job hiring. I gave her the info she claim she was coming to apply but never showed the next morning. She texted later that day saying they\u2019re going to Kentucky October 12 how should she wear her hair. I replied. She texted me Sunday morning asking what I was doing and then explained how she was depressed about my cousin and she don\u2019t have a job etc so I offered to call her. She claim she was at work and asked if I wanted to come over at 9:40 am i replied what time at 9:44 am I didn\u2019t receive a response still. I was strolling on Facebook and see she\u2019s not working and she\u2019s with my cousin. Should I call her out for lying? I don\u2019t understand her purpose for lying to me.", "subreddit": "FriendshipAdvice"}
