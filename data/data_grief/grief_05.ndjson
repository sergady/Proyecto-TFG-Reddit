I'm really, really struggling.", "author": "expectinggarbanzo", "self_text": "All of my life I've known that I have a sister in Heaven. We always had a picture of her hung somewhere in the home - she looks out from the image with brown eyes as deep as the ocean, curly brown hair tucked under a white hat, hands held politely in front of her, looking wise beyond her years. Her name was Shandra, and she was tiny for her age, that much I knew. In this picture she is around 2 years old. My mom would talk about her every so often, and my sisters and I would listen eagerly to stories about our big sister that was no longer there. As we got older we'd learn more about her. She died when she was 2 years and 8 months old from lymphoma. I always knew that it was a cancer that was extremely rare in small children that stole my sister from us. I always knew that my sister was sick most of her life and they struggled for a long time to find out what exactly was wrong, I always knew she went through so many MRI's, cat scans, etc. and that my mom blamed her cancer on that.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nGrowing up, the hole in our lives that Shandra left behind was normal. It took me a long time to realize that not every family has a monumental loss like this. The normalcy that I felt around the loss caused me to not ask as many questions as I now wish I would have. We lost my mom a year ago to pancreatic cancer. A few times I thought the grief would kill me. Over the last year, as I've reflected on my life and relationship with my mom and my regrets, I linger on the loss of my sister. I feel so much guilt for not talking about her with my mom more, for not asking more questions, for not hugging my mom and telling her I'm so sorry for what she went through.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis last weekend we had the difficult task of clearing out my mom's house to be sold. While going through her office, I found a grief journal she wrote in 2009. She recounted, in vivid detail, the life and death of my sister. Some things I knew, a lot of things I didn't. I'd like to recount Shandra's story for you all, mostly transcribed directly from my mom's grief journal (with some things reworded, and shifted to third-person perspective). I know it is long - a quick TLDR...Shandra was born tiny and frail, struggling to gain weight - undergoing dozens of scans throughout her short life to find the cause. At 2 and a half years old, she had lymphoma and little chance of surviving the cancer or the chemo. My parents tried the first round of chemo and Shandra nearly died. They decided against the next round, opting to take her home and pray for a miracle. CPS was granted emergency custody on grounds of 'medical neglect' due to this, and forced Shandra to get another dose of chemo, which ultimately killed her.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;My mom was 22 when she had Shandra in 1984. She was tiny, especially for a full-term baby, weighing only 4 pounds. For the first 3 months of her life she struggled to gain any weight. The doctors were baffled, and that was when they began all of the testing. MRI's, CAT scans, injecting her with dye and x-raying her, blood tests, and so on and so on. She was put on a feeding tube and every ounce of nourishment was measured - she was getting sufficient amounts that she should have been gaining weight. But she wasn't. The doctors thought that she may have a tumor, and that was where her calories was getting expended. They finally decided to open her up to see if there was a tumor - after the operation the doctor came out and said that her small intestine \"looked as if a bomb had gone off in it\". It was shredded to pieces, they didn't know what to make of it. They sent her case out for consultation, and a doctor in California responded that he had a similar case - the problem turned out to be a lack of enzymes in the intestine to break down food into a form that nutrients could be extracted. Because it wasn't broken down by the time it reached the intestine, the effect it had on her intestines was like acid. They tested Shandra and sure enough - she had no digestive enzymes. The doctor in California had been able to make a special formula for the other child by introducing synthetic enzymes into the formula so that the nourishment entered the child's body already in a form that could be utilized. By the time the California child had reached age 3 his body had begun to produce the enzymes normally. Years later my mom learned that such problems had become fairly common in babies, but at the time Shandra was diagnosed it was very, very rare.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;She had to be fed with a tube and could eat nothing by mouth - when she was about eleven months old they were finally able to take her home from the hospital. She was still tiny for her age - at a year old she weighed just over 12 pounds. It was a battle - gain two ounces, lose one, gain one, lose three - every ounce she gained and held onto was a victory. Until she was about 20 months she was constantly in and out of the hospital frequently, going through many, many CAT scans, MRI's, etc. to see how her intestine was healing and always to be watching for tumors - they kept thinking she must have a tumor as she struggled so hard to maintain weight, and they couldn't think of any other possibility that could be draining so many calories from her.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;When she was about 18 months, her intestine had healed enough so that she could begin to take food by mouth. However, without having done so she had no clue what to do with a bite of food. she would hold it in her cheek like a chipmunk and refuse to swallow. For one thing, her mouth muscles hadn't developed as she hadn't exercised them through eating by mouth since birth. A second problem was that she had a tube down her throat and it was uncomfortable to swallow. But until she could eat on her own, she also had to have the tube.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;It took about six months to overcome that problem. By the time she was two years old she was eating by mouth, she had begun to produce enzymes and they could slowly introduce different types of food. They were able to find enough foods that she could begin to digest and eventually were able to wean her off the tube.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;She was a normal two year old child for about six or seven months - playing, talking, dancing, laughing. It was the best time. She loved airplanes. She could hear an airplane outside long before anyone else noticed it and run to the window searching frantically until it came into view. She would point and excitedly exclaim, \"plane! plane!\" One of her favorite things to do was to go to the airport and watch planes take off and land. For some reason, she was fascinated by them.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;One day she was eating a cookie. she heard a plane and ran to the window and was craning her neck to look for the plane. With her neck stretched, she swallowed a bite of cookie and as she did so my mom noticed a lump on her throat. She felt it and it was small and hard, about the size of a pea. My mom called the pediatrician and took her in - he thought it was just an infected lymph node from a recent cold. He said it should go away in a few weeks. Over the next few weeks the lump grew quickly until it was very noticeable. At the same time she lost energy quickly, wanting to sleep more and more. After a couple more visits to the pediatrician, they decided to send her to the Children's Hospital.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Quite quickly they diagnosed her with non-Hodgkin's, non-lymphoblastic T-cell lymphoma. It wasn't good. The oncologist said that typically this kind of cancer was only seen in men, over age 50, in urban cities with significant radiation exposure. The doctor said that if she were given chemo in the recommended protocol (set for the typical patient - a 50+ year old male) it would likely kill her. Yet without chemo and radiation the cancer would kill her. Did they want to try the chemo? What a choice. They knew she would die without it - yet she was given 6+ months to live. If they opted for the chemo her chance of surviving was very slim and would likely hasten her death. They decided they had to try.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;The oncologist gave her the first dose. She nearly died - she had to be put on a respirator and barely survived. It was quite clear that she wasn't strong enough to survive the full protocol. They asked to take her home when she recovered enough. The doctors agreed - giving them enough medical equipment, medication for pain, etc. to take her home.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;As my mom was leaving the hospital the oncologist said \"I want to know that you know that she will die. You do know and accept that?\" My mom replies, \"no, I don't know that. I believe in God - I believe in miracles. I don't know that. You have all done everything you can do but I don't know that God as done everything He can. We are praying for a miracle.\"  \n&gt;  \n&gt;They were home for about three days - it was the middle of December. One night, there was a terrific cold front and it was snowing. My mom was on the sofa holding Shandra while she played with a toy airplane. There was a knock at the door and my dad opened it. Three police officers and some CPS workers came into the house stating they had a court order to remove Shandra from my parent's care for medical neglect. Medical neglect? The child had spent more of her life in hospitals than out - she had been under medical care every day of her life. My mom said, \"you are mistaken, what are you talking about? Call her pediatrician right now. He will tell you there has never been medical neglect or any other kind of neglect.\" The CPS worker ignored my mom's pleas and began to unplug Shandra's machines and ordered the cops to start carrying them out to the squad car. One of the officers intervened - told her \"I think you made a mistake here\" and told her not to do anything until his sergeant arrived. The sergeant arrived and ended up calling Shandra's pediatrician. My mom could hear the pediatrician on the other end screaming \"I'm coming over - don't any of you do anything until I get there, don't touch that child.\" After a few minutes the officer handed the phone to my mom, and the pediatrician told her\" I'm 5 minutes away - she cannot go out in this weather, her health is too precarious.\"  \n&gt;  \n&gt;The CPS worker was livid, and my mom began pleading for answers and information, asking where they would take Shandra. She found out they planned to take her to a children's shelter for foster kids. My mom grew furious, saying \"she can't be around other children, even a cold could kill her. She can't go there.\" By this time, more cops and EMT's showed up and one of the EMT's said \"her condition is too precarious and she has too much medication and life-support machines to go anywhere except with someone trained to operate them.\" The CPS worker leaned over to the feeding pump and said, \"well? How do you work this?\" My mom was absolutely gobsmacked, she had to go through weeks of training to operate the machines.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;The pediatrician finally arrived and it was decided that Shandra would go to the hospital. Just the coming in and out and the cold air had started to cause her respiratory problems. She was admitted to the hospital and already had a collapsed lung. The pediatrician called a lawyer for my parents - he said there would be an emergency appeal the next morning. Apparently, what had happened was that the hospital had a legal department that reviewed all dismissals - namely those that were 'sent home to die'. If patients are sent home - and then die - it leaves the hospital vulnerable to families later suing and saying the hospital didn't do all that it could. It was legal protocol for the attending physician to elicit a statement from the individual or family stating they were aware that death was unavoidable. My mom hadn't given them the statement they'd wanted - so the hospital legal department's claim made to CPS was that 'with a chemo protocol survival rate of 60%' (not based upon Shandra specifically but based on the typical patient) and my mom's statement of 'praying for a miracle,' the claim was that they'd taken Shandra out of the hospital to pray for her rather than seek a medical solution.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;At the emergency appeal the next morning, no one was allowed to appear in the courtroom. They could not call witnesses or present evidence. The attorney could appear on my parent's behalf but could not call witnesses or present evidence to argue against CPS's findings. CPS had been contacted by the hospital, they took the claim as fact and asked for an emergency injunction to remove her that had been granted by the judge. My parent showed up to the courthouse that morning to try and appeal that judge's decision - but it was almost unprecedented to have something like this overturned. After about 45 minutes, the lawyer came out and said the judge had ruled that custody would remain with CPS and the court ordered her to return to Children's and resume chemotherapy. But that will kill her, my parents argued. But regardless that was the court order - the only concession he'd been able to get was the judge offered that my parents could take her back themselves rather than having CPS transport her. If my parents refused the offer - if they chose to fight the order - they'd be barred from contact with her and Shandra would likely die without them ever seeing her again.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;What kind of choice is that? My parents were absolutely devastated, but what choice did they have? They conceded and said they'd take her back themselves. They went home and got a few clothes and things for her - my mom recounts standing in the door as they were preparing to leave. Shandra's toy airplane was still on the sofa, she had been playing with it when everyone showed up. Her bib was hanging on the back of her high chair and a bowl of soup was still on the tray. My mom couldn't bear to move it to the sink and clean it. She didn't know when they'd be back but she knew it would be without Shandra and couldn't bear to wash that bowl. She couldn't bear the thought that it would be the last time she'd clean her high chair, that that was her last meal at home. She looked at it and had the most absurd argument with herself - 'you should wash it before you go' vs. 'I can't bear to wash it'. The unfathomable predicament they had been forced into - they couldn't fight the order without being barred from seeing her ever again, if they fought she would have to die without my mom there to hold her and comfort her. My mom must have stood in that door vexing over whether to wash the bowl for almost half an hour. She finally left it.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;They loaded Shandra into her car seat, hanging her feeding bag from the hook for clotheshangers, and headed toward the hospital. They pulled off the interstate at the next exit and thought about their options - they could run for Mexico. But they had no money, and how would they get pain medication for Shandra? Or nutrition for her feeding tube? And they'd already been told the State Patrol would be watching for them in case they tried to flee. They had no choice - they had to take her. They pulled off at the next exit and debated it all over again, and came to the same conclusion- they had no choice. They did that at every exit, always coming to the same conclusion. It took them almost seven hours to get to the hospital, a drive that normally took two and a half. They met up with her oncologist at the hospital, he was very distressed. My parents asked - I thought you said another dose would kill her? Why would they do this? The oncologist didn't say much.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;The next morning a doctor my parents didn't recognize came in and said it was time for her to go for chemo. They asked where the usual oncologist was, and he wouldn't say. The nurse later said the doctor had refused to give the chemo and said, \"I became a doctor to save children's lives, not kill them.' So the hospital had brought someone else to do it.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;They gave Shandra the chemo and she stopped breathing during the treatment. She was put on a ventilator and when my parents saw her in the ICU some hours later she was barely clinging to life. She had so many tubes running in and out of her body that they couldn't even hold her. Machines surrounded her - it was difficult to even get close to her. By late that day, the catheter tube began to turn pink, showing blood in her urine. By the next morning it was running completely red. They asked my mom's permission to remove the feeding tube. Then to remove the platelet and blood transfusions which were not keeping up with the blood she was losing. Finally on the third day they asked to remove the ventilator. My mom cried and pleaded 'no, no no. I can't bear to lose her. I can't let her go.' They said, 'we have to do it soon, but you tell us when you are ready.'  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Shandra was barely ever conscious - hazily opening her eyes and searching until she found mom. My mom prayed and prayed that she wouldn't die - thinking her heart would burst through her chest it hurt so much to think of losing Shandra. Every cell in her body ached at the thought. She describes the pain as all of your skin suddenly being gone and every nerve ending in your body exposed to air and cold. Once again, Shandra opened her eyes and this time she looked intently into a space above her. She looked at my mom and as if my mom could actually hear her speak - she said - I'm going now.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;My mom recounts the same look in Shandra's eyes weeks before. She was walking Shandra around the hospital in a little wagon painted like an ambulance. As mom was pulling the wagon, she looked back at Shandra. Shandra had that intent 'listening' look and my mom felt a presence so real. She knelt down beside Shandra, she couldn't speak and hadn't been able to for two months. A tube had to be put down quickly and it and damaged her throat. My mom heard that same plea then as she did now - ' please let me go, I need to go now. Please let me go. 'My mom sobbed and pleaded \"No, no, no, keep fighting baby - we will beat this, just don't give up\" Shandra sat back and dropped her eyes.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;This time, my mom went to her and said, \"I'll find you again.

And she took Shandra's respirator off. Shandra closed her eyes and took one long breath in, and as she breathed out - her soul left her body.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI had no idea that my parents were forced to give Shandra that second dose of chemo. I always knew that there was an incident with CPS - and we learned a few years ago that my mom's aunt \"corroborated\" CPS' medical neglect claims (she was an evil witch). My mom never fully accepted the loss of Shandra, and my dad was not supportive of my mom's grief. My mom did all sorts of things to memorialize Shandra, including constructing 'Shandra's Playhouse', a playground outside the Children's Hospital where she died. We recently learned that it was unceremoniously demolished to make room for something new and shiny. This aspect of the story has absolutely devastated me and I just wish I could hug my mom and tell her how sorry I am that she had to lose her first baby like that.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy only solace is knowing that in some way, my mom and Shandra's souls are together again. I think my mom was taken away early from us because their souls could just not bear being apart anymore. I miss and love you both so, so, so much. Please give each other a big hug and kiss from me. I can't wait to see you again, mom and I can't wait to finally meet you, Shandra. My son has your eyes.", "subreddit": "GriefSupport"}

Anne. it was Anne. i don\u2019t remember what i said back to her but she made me give the phone back to my cousin, and i went into the tv room. the morning news was just starting. ill never forget what happened. there on the national news was a picture of Anne, and the headline read \u201cJogger Found Dead\u201d. so we stared at the tv, not saying anything, listening to a news anchor tell us our cousin and granddaughter was murdered.\nok, after this, i don\u2019t remember anything. i remember fainting in my room and being unconscious for 1 hour. i remember packing up my cousins car with my grandpas oxygen tank and i remember the drive back to new york feeling like it was 5 minutes long. one thing i know is the entire car ride i didnt believe it. i knew it wasnt Anne, she was always traveling or working or at school, she\u2019s probably there, in 5 minutes theyre gonna find her alive in France or Spain or at home and this is gonna all just be a small blunder.\nbut then we pulled up to my aunt and uncles block. and the entire thing was taped off and cop cars, squad vans, CSIs, and 100 different news outlets sat in front if the house. thats when i knew - there was no mistake. my cousin was murdered.\n\nim 18 now and starting college soon. the trial just ended for her killer, and he\u2019ll be spending the rest of his life in prison. but every day im still sad. im still not okay. when i let myself think about it i cry for hours. my family isn\u2019t necessarily broken now; we came together and are stronger as a family. but at the same time, Anne\u2019s parents cant be in the same room together. her sister is no longer the person she was. every family function it is glaringly and painfully obvious that we are missing someone. my family is forever incomplete. \nAnne was only 30 years old, and only 30 for less than a month before she was taken from us due to a random attack. i feel like at this point i should be okay. we weren\u2019t close we were 15 years apart. but i still cant get over it. \n\nwhat happened to your family when it happened? how did you guys get through it?\n\ni just want to be happy again.\n\nedit: i should also mention that i dont have friends at this point. when it first happened no one in my school would talk to me because they had no idea what to say. so no one talked to me about anything. my boyfriend is my only friend. when i say i have no friends i mean it. i dont snapchat anyone or talk to anyone in school, when my boyfriend is not around i just sit alone at home and either think about Anne or smoke weed. oh yeah, the trauma also pushed me into a marijuana addiction. i cant be sober and i cant be alone. i go to therapy and im on meds but thats all because i was depressed anyway before all of this.", "subreddit": "GriefSupport"}

I can\u2019t remember how it started, but it was physical during my high school years. Hair pulling, screaming, face slapping, back hitting (when I\u2019d curl up in a defensive ball). Didn\u2019t clean my room to perfection? Whole closet\u2019s on the floor now. Consistently got compared to my biological father whom she hated with the passion flames of a thousand suns. She stopped being physical when I fought back, but the verbal and mental abuse and gaslighting never stopped.\n\nI still loved her. Whether this was some form of Stockholm Syndrome or because I was naive enough to continuously fall for the semblance of affection she gave me, who knows. People always said we were her world and she was so proud of us. Sometimes I believed it. Most of the time I didn\u2019t.\n\nShe was diagnosed with Stage IV Ovarian Cancer in 2016 and passed in January 2018. I cried for a week straight. She was my mother.

She was always so secretive and so uncompromising, but she still was mother at times.\n\nOne of the very first emotions I could identify during this whole grief process was relief. And it scares me to think about, and it scares me to voice it out loud. I\u2019ve only told my therapist, who seems understanding given all that she knows. It\u2019s relieving not to be consistently screamed at for not cleaning the dishes right. It\u2019s relieving not to be constantly told I should be doing X instead of Y.

{"post_id": "bjjfri", "created_utc": 1556729461, "title": "26 - Lost My Mom While Working Abroad", "author": "5UBLIME-", "self_text": "Hi, I'm new to using reddit and looking to connect with people who have shared experiences of grief. I'd like to share my story with people, because it's something I was ashamed of for most of my life. My mom passed away at the end of February and I wasn't in the country, I didn't get to see her or hold her hand, to say goodbye.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm a 26 year old female and I was recently living in Shenzhen, China and teaching abroad. I've spent the last three years teaching in Europe. I graduated university in 2015 and I went abroad immediately. I had intended to return to my city and do an M.Ed, but there was a job fair with positions abroad and I was drawn to that. I had spent five years away at school and I tried to maintain a comfortable distance between family and I. I was raised by a single parent, my mom never worked a day in my life. She was on social assistance and her days revolved around smoking cigarettes, watching TV, and eating. No one in my family had graduated high school, my oldest brother was very successful and owned our house, but I was the first in my family to go to university. I kind of feel like the black sheep of the family.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy mom had several cancer scares, which terrified my family as she had smoked for over 40 years. In my last year of undergrad she underwent a 6 hour surgery where they removed 20% of her right lung. Subsequently, she had the lung collapse and spent a lot of time in ICU. The following year she had surgery to remove her thyroid which was cancerous, but not related to the lung cancer (it hadn't spread, the thyroid cancer was localised) and her doctors were monitoring the other lung. All of this happened over the span of finishing my B.A, finishing my B.Ed and moving to Sweden for my first teaching job.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSweden was a tough year, I flew for the first time in my life. It was my first time leaving Canada. I felt lonely not having a support system at home, I was 22 and out in the world - paying back my student loans, travelling. I made some great friends, but the job sucked. Especially for someone right out of university and I just felt grateful to be away from my life in Canada. So, flash forward. I got a 2 year contract to teach in Italy, which felt like a smooth transition already living in Europe. Needless to say, life was not 'la dolce vita'. I struggled to connect with people because unlike my experience in Sweden, people were not receptive. The work environment had a very cliquey feel among the English staff and connecting with local Italians felt impossible without a knowledge of the language. I tried to learn Italian, but I had just moved to a new country. I was working out the paperwork and legal stuff (banking, work permit, etc.), I was teaching full time (adjusting to a new school, curriculum, etc.)  and I lived with a roommate who made me feel terrible. I relied on school provided housing because it seemed easiest, I hadn't made any Italian friends early on to help me find an alternative option. In retrospect, I was really young and helpless.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIn my first year of the contract, my mom had congestive heart failure. I got a call around Christmas saying that my mom had either had a stroke or a heart attack. I was gutted. I didn't fly home right away, because she had many occurrences of hospital stays and health issues. Not to diminish the fact, but living in another country I couldn't just drive home every time something happened. I had to wait (considering the time difference) and talk to my brothers (who, by the way are 20 years older than I am... I am 26 and they are respectively 44 and 46). My mom ending up pulling through, per usual. She maintained her lifestyle, though she had quit smoking after the lung surgery. She was morbidly obese, close to the point of immobility. She relied on my 'youngest' older brother to take care of her. Throughout all of her hospital stays, surgeries, treatments, and so on, she was mean to family, alienated friends, and was pretty terrible towards hospital staff and doctors and times.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIn the second year of my contract (September 2017) I got a call saying my nephew had a brain tumour. He was 17, closer in age than my brothers. I remember going to his doctor appointments when my sister in law was pregnant, he felt like my baby brother. He was a healthy guy, played hockey, went for a routine eye appointment and it turned out he had a massive brain tumour pressing on his optic nerve. Within 24 hours we were told he was dying because his brain was swelling. This was a Friday, so I flew out and arrived Sunday. On Monday he had an 11 hour brain surgery. His recovery has been miraculous, because he has his sight, his memory, proper function. Nonetheless, it was devastating. He turned 18 in the hospital. One day I was rubbing oil in his remaining hair (they had shaved half of his head as the incision was from ear to ear across the top of his head) and he said he wanted me to move home. He said all he had ever wanted for me was to be home. For myself, someone who hadn't felt much self worth, I was gutted. I spent one week in Canada and I flew back to Italy, right back to work.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNone of my coworkers reached out. I had swapped roommates with coworkers, living with my 'best friend' at the time who was diagnosed with bi-polar disorder. So, lots of ups and downs. I was already struggling with my mental health, my mom was ill and now my nephew was sick. That experienced wasn't validated, some Italian coworkers didn't even know I had left the country. The English staff while aware, weren't really supportive. No one asked me to grab a coffee, or if I ever needed to chat. I felt like absolutely, 100% transparent. And that's a really bad feeling. I felt like people saw right through me, like I didn't matter. My job was tough, the living situation was worsening. By mid October I was close to a breakdown. The new director at the school had offered me an out from the two year position. I could leave at Christmas in good standing and return to Canada.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTo avoid further rambling, I met my current boyfriend 1-2 weeks after giving my resignation. Again, absolutely gutted. I had no plan in Canada, little savings. I left the one person I had really loved and connected with (especially in such a short time). I had dated one Italian guy for 8 months or so prior, being accused of being 'mysterious' (never quite 'secretive' but I had the feeling he wasn't happy with had closed off I was). I was terrified to let myself be seen, to say that living in Italy wasn't wonderful and filled with expats, food, travel, learning a new language, etc. It was all of those things and it wasn't, it felt like something it should have been. When I returned to Canada in January, my Airbnb fell through because the furnace blew. I squatted with my best friend at her home, dodging my family as a whole and limiting my interactions with my mom.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy January - June consisted of daily radiation appointments for my nephew (who was staying with my mom in the city for treatments) and hospital appointments for my mom. While working a crappy minimum wage job, not related to teaching at all. One of my last big memories of my mom and I is a hospital trip which I had to push her wheel chair and her oxygen tank to the bathroom. I lifted her on to the toilet (by this time she was around 400 pounds) and I wiped her. This was something I never wanted to do, it wasn't a complication of the heart failure or the cancer, it was a result of her obesity. A lot of her health was circumstantial, due to lifestyle.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAt the time I had applied for the original M.Ed again, I got in (again) to the same fully funded program. I was scared of staying in the city, in Canada in general. My life felt empty and hopeless, somehow even more so than it did while living abroad. I found a job with a Canadian school board in China and I left for Shenzhen at the end of August. My nephew's radiation finished (the tumour was non-cancerous, a benign growth - with no history of the condition in our family by the way, this is still something pretty shocking to us) and the remaining tumour was considered inactive. My mom's health had stabilised, she understood my decision to go to China and supported me in the end. For someone who was as sick as she was and for so long, I felt like I couldn't wait here any longer and wait for something to worsen. It was like a rollercoaster, up and down and so often. Every single hospital stay, I grieved her loss. Every procedure, surgery, diagnosis, medication, assistive device (oxygen tanks, wheel chairs, walkers, all of it) just hurt. My mom made no effort to eat better, or exercise, or try at all. Watching that self-destructive decline was awful.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, in China I faced a number of issues. Unlike anything before, no surprise. Cockroaches, rats in the office (never seen, confirmed with poop presents on the desks), humidity, bugs, over crowding of people, internet restrictions (I don't miss the VPN...), etc. It was an incredibly developed city, with air quality better than other places (as a reference, I was about 30 minutes from Hong Kong). Regardless, I had a class of 37 students as I worked in a public school. In October I had hand foot and mouth disease, which was an awful experience. I relied on teaching with a microphone after, as the illness caused ulcers in my throat. Unlike Italy, I had very supportive coworkers. Kind of a mixed bag of people, some odd personalities but very kind and and present people. I took this job because of the unbeatable salary by the way - I paid off $4,800 in LASIK surgery, $5000 in student debt. Over Chinese New Year I went to Vietnam and Thailand. In September I survived a typhoon and regardless of being sick and it all being messy, I committed myself mentally to a second year. I wanted to get a good reference, pay my student debt, and return to Canada with savings. I could finally afford to pay my bills, eat, and live reasonably. I was doing 'online therapy' due to limited access to resources in China, I was focusing on my mental health (working through issues I had in Italy, in life in general).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAt the end of February my mom went into the hospital and within days she died. She was undergoing dialysis and because of her size, they sedated her to lay her flat (she couldn't lay flat by the way, normally). She had a breathing tube, a feeding tube. My oldest brother face timed me one morning (it's a 12 hour time difference) and I could see how sick my mom was. I talked to her, I told her I loved her, but she was unconscious. My brother said she squeezed his hand, but she seemed unresponsive. Situations similar to this had arisen before, she would go into the hospital for a few weeks (tell everyone to fuck off, literally) and then would go home and resume life. The doctors said she was stable. She had acquired some kind of infection, but they were treating her symptoms. No one expected it to happen suddenly. After explaining this to the best of my ability, the gradual decline over the last five years or so, it might seem like we were naive in thinking it would be okay... but we always got through these things trying to hope for the best.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI can't even tell you the day she died, I know it was a Sunday night for me and a morning there. Her heart just stopped beating. They tried CPR and my brother had to call it, as the designated family member. The doctors said she was suffering. I found out through iMessage, because why not... My brother's mistress texted me her condolences. Why not add on some family drama and emotional trauma?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI took three weeks off from work, I paid nearly $2000 to fly home (which is a 15 hour flight at best, not considering possible layovers). I paid for my boyfriend to come to Canada (he offered immediately, but wasn't in a position in that moment to just pay for that). As a side note, my boyfriend and I have been dating since Italy. He's visited Canada and China, my mom absolutely adored him. He was the first person in a long time who I let meet my family and spend time with my mom. He's been an absolute rock in my life.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, I guess the last reference point is my mom's funeral. It was a traumatic experience for me, which caused nightmares for several weeks. My aunt passed away 13 days after my mom, her older sister was also unwell and the timing just gutted my family. I couldn't even bring myself to go to her funeral, because of the experience at my mom's just weeks before. I was a mess.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI struggled with the time difference, I caught a cold, I wasn't sleeping or eating properly. I kept dreaming of my mom in her casket. For someone who was so ill and died in such circumstances, she didn't look like herself. I hadn't seen her since August in person, we hadn't spoken since the New Year. I was distancing myself to set boundaries, I was focusing on my self care and not letting myself become absorbed in family drama. So the last time I saw my mom was when she was dead. My sister in law said I could hold her hand (I had never touched a dead body, I barely had experienced a funeral as I had been really young at the time and didn't comprehend the experience as significantly as I could being an adult) and when I reached in, I was shocked. She was cold, hard. Her face had bruising, she was swollen. The funeral home did the best that they could, but it didn't look like my mom. I didn't get to say goodbye, I thought I'd say something to her but I couldn't bring myself to. I cried a lot. I kissed my mom's cheek and left a single rose and a cigarette in her coffin, both of those things she loved (despite my disapproval of smoking, I had to leave her with something).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI returned to China and got really sick. Apparently black mould is bad for you, I had been living with it since I moved into my school provided apartment and it had blossomed in my absence. I spent a few days at home with a fever, intestinal problems, cognitive disfunction. I finally asked another coworker who told me to get out of my place. I was in China, emotionally devastated, sick, totally beside myself in the situation. I just wanted to come home. My family promised me change, support, and safety. I felt like I couldn't continue working in that environment, even though I could have changed apartments I would have had issues with mould and cockroaches regardless (yay southern China). So I breached contract, I flew 15 hours for a third time to return home. I lost my financial stability, my mental stability is fragile. I'm adjusting to a reverse culture shock. I'm trying to maintain boundaries with my family, while living in their house. In many ways, I feel like a feral street cat someone took in.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMost recently I cry randomly, if something reminds me of my mom (which isn't hard, living in her old house and staying in my childhood bedroom). My older brother and his family live out of the city, my other brother lives downstairs. They are looking to fill the other rooms with roommates. I feel disconnected from people, like I have nothing to offer. Teaching jobs are difficult to find here (another incentive for staying abroad..) So I'm currently unemployed, I have two good friends. My boyfriend is in Italy, hoping to move to Canada in a few months. I'm trying my best to get into a routine, to be social, to be kind to myself. I went to a job fair, an employment service, I'm on a waitlist for a grief support group and I got a referral to a psychiatrist from my doctor. It just takes time, it takes effort. Some days I feel like bolting, I browse international jobs. Here doesn't feel like home, the moment doesn't feel right.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf you've managed to read this whole thing, I'm surprised and grateful. I've shared more in a post than I have with many of the people in my life. I'm hoping to connect with others who have experienced grief. Due to circumstances, it feels hard to connect to people in day to day life. As a euphemism, family and friends have said my mom wasn't an easy person to get along with. Our relationship was hard, the ending feels tragic. I have remorse, anger, regret. Mostly, I feel isolated and lonely, pretty hopeless.", "subreddit": "GriefSupport"}

Reasoning being, if I hurt this much for my friend how much more for their sibling? Their sibling also died a tragic death. \nBut now they are the only one left. And they just had a baby and their parents will never get to see that baby. And they had been trying for a baby for so very long. And their parents nor sibling can ever get to meet their kid they tried to meet themselves for years. They were going to visit their parent this summer with the kiddo. And it\u2019s all just a cluster cuss. \nAnd I\u2019m on the other side of the country so I can\u2019t even be there for them. \nAnd they have their spouse and their beautiful baby. But they\u2019re cussing alone and I can\u2019t even be there for them and I feel so guilty because I just had a baby my first try. \nAnd my husband isn\u2019t here for me in this. \nHe just went to the gym and didn\u2019t even consider staying behind to comfort me because he gave me a hug earlier and listened to a more detailed story than what I posted here. He is clueless when I really need him doesn\u2019t believe me when I say that I do. \nSo how do I stop crying? How do I cope with this sad sad story that I can do nothing about? And pleeeeeease don\u2019t say pray. I grew up in the church and I don\u2019t need that right now. Feel free to pray for me, but Thst isn\u2019t an option for me rn.\nPlease and thank you \nAnd buddy if you\u2019re reading this I\u2019m so so so sorry and I hope I didn\u2019t betray any trust by posting your story on here", "subreddit": "GriefSupport"}

Anyways I don\u2019t know where to begin but give some backstory. 2 weeks ago on April 18th 2019 my dad died. He was in the ICU for 2 weeks and in a regular patient room awaiting surgery for 1 week before he was transferred to the ICU. I am 16 my sister is 18 and my brother is 14. My dad has been sick and unhealthy my entire life and he was older, he was 72 when he died. He was overweight, diabetic, diagnosed with Parkinson\u2019s disease, suffered a heart attack, a stroke, had multiple surgery\u2019s, etc. all throughout my childhood/ teenage years. He wasn\u2019t active or very mobile so it was hard for me and my siblings because he tried his best to be as present in our lives as he could but it was hard for him. He struggled with his weight his entire life, he was very poor growing up and sometimes didn\u2019t have enough to eat. He started in the restaurant business when he got older and was super passionate and opened a few restaurants, but with his childhood traumas and stress he began eating and never stopped. I loved him so much he was my inspiration and my best friend. I miss him so much and I feel so empty and numb sometimes I feel sad but other times I feel nothing I feel like I\u2019m in a dream like this ain\u2019t happening this isn\u2019t real this is a joke it doesn\u2019t feel like he is dead like he is gone but he is some days I cry some I don\u2019t. Sometimes for a split second it feels real like he isn\u2019t anymore but then it just doesn\u2019t. I hate not feeling it makes me feel so guilty I hate that I feel nothing and I feel numb I want to feel and I keep telling myself \u201cmy dad is dead\u201d over and over again but I don\u2019t feel anything I cry when I see my mom cry or my sister or my brother but not because I\u2019m sad I\u2019m only sad sometimes at night when I look at pictures or the last voicemail he sent me a cry a little but then I fell numb again all I want is too feel so I can move on but I can\u2019t I don\u2019t know why. I literally saw him die before my eyes in the ICU I saw his heart stop them preforming CPR and shocking his heart to try and revive him I saw everything I held his dead hand and stand with his lifeless body talking to him and crying and then after that I felt nothing I shut down I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s a coping mechanism because if I did truly feel all my feelings I wouldn\u2019t survive but I feel horrible feeling nothing and I don\u2019t know what to do I miss him but I feel nothing how is that even possible he\u2019s my dad why don\u2019t I feel like my mom or my sister I don\u2019t understand. I don\u2019t understand how I\u2019m 16 and I\u2019m never going to see my dad again, I\u2019m never going to talk with him, laugh with him, play cards with him, drive around with him, sing with him. I wish I spent more time with him played more cards with him asked him more questions gave him more hugs tell him I loved him more there are still so many things I want to do with him and ask him and talk about with him but I can\u2019t and I just don\u2019t understand. Every moment and everything I experienced before April 18th my dad was alive but everything I experience after he isn\u2019t and that just doesn\u2019t feel real at all this doesn\u2019t feel real but at the same time it does I have pain but it\u2019s numb, numb pain. Sorry this is so long I just have never felt anything like this before and I honestly don\u2019t even know what I\u2019m feeling so thanks for reading", "subreddit": "GriefSupport"}

My daughter and I traveled to visit my parents for spring break, and the day after we arrived she died.  When we were visiting the evening that we arrived, my mom said that she thought she had a UTI.  I took her to the doctor's office the next morning.  They took all of her vital signs, did a UA, poked and prodded all of her major organs, confirmed the diagnosis of a UTI, called in an antibiotic and sent us on our way.  My mom only got to take one dose of her antibiotic, then...\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe were watching TV in the living room, and all of the sudden my mom started talking about things that didn't make sense for the current situation, and getting angry that we didn't understand what she wanted.  I called my sister that lives nearby to help me take her to the ER since I don't know the area very well.  A few minutes later, she starts having trouble breathing.  I call 911 and ambulance is en route.  My mom says she can't see, and then I can tell that she's trying to breathe but not really taking any air in.  I keep asking the 911 operator what to do, and she keeps saying just wait.  I'm first aid and CPR certified, but in that moment my instincts just couldn't kick in.  I didn't try CPR; I didn't even take her pulse.  The ambulance finally arrives in what seems like an eternity (in reality, it was less than 10 minutes).  My sister arrives at the same time as the ambulance.  They load my mom up and my sister and I follow the ambulance to the hospital.  I leave my daughter with my dad (who I haven't mentioned yet, but I'll get there).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy other sister meets us at the hospital, and we wait, ask front desk, wait more, ask front desk, waiting again, and are finally brought into a room where we are told that she had no pulse when EMS arrived.  They did everything they could.  It was likely septic shock.  She was 72 years old - one week shy of her 73rd birthday.  My mom was my guiding light and moral compass, and my family's matriarch.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy dad has debilitating depression and anxiety - and has been this way since he retired nearly 10 years ago.  My mom did everything for him, accommodated all of his needs, and took care of all of their finances for the past 10 years.  My mom's death is incredibly hard for him - they were high school sweethearts.  He can still do a lot of things for himself (shower himself, feed himself, etc.) but refuses to do other tasks for himself such as laundry and cook (they already had someone come weekly to clean).  He hasn't driven in at least 5 years.  My sisters check on him daily, but he is growing weaker and being alone so much is not good for his mental health.  I have tried to get him to come live with me and my family, but he says it is too far away (it's less than 300 miles).  I am the only one that is willing to take on his needs.  I am the baby of the family and my dad and I are especially close.  I don't understand how my siblings could turn their own father away, but in reality he probably wouldn't feel comfortable living with them anyway.  My sisters have found an assisted living facility for my dad, and he is on the wait list.  I went and toured the place, and I'm not totally against it, but my dad won't clearly say this is what he wants (one of my sisters has POA over my dad, so he doesn't really have to) - he won't say that it isn't what he wants either.  Both he and I understand that with his depression he probably won't be happy anywhere, but at least he would be taken care of.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOn top of all of this, my daughter saw her grandma die right in front of her.  My daughter and my mom were so close - like two peas in a pod.  I know this is hard for my daughter, but she really doesn't say much about it.  This is the first death in our family since she was born.  I asked the school counselor to check in with my daughter - my daughter said the counselor never reached out to her.  My daughter says she is ok.  I'm trying to be there for my daughter, but I am also gone every other weekend visiting my dad.  I call my dad twice a day.  My dad is always on my mind.  I'm tired.  I'm sad.  I know that I'm not being the best mom that I can be.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy husband is a good husband, but he doesn't understand how hard all of this is for me.  It was my mom, and she died in my arms.  He doesn't pretend to understand though - which is good for me.  He listens, he takes care of things while I am gone, he loves me.  But, again, I know I'm not being the best wife I can be right now.  I'm difficult to be around.  I'm always the planner and decision maker - and I just don't have the mental capacity to make any decisions right now.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnyway, if you've made it through all this, I'm willing to hear your advice.

I can\u2019t afford the $500 to even send in her tissue samples.", "author": "LinearEquation", "self_text": "In my lifetime I\u2019ve lost 3 classmates, my own maternal grandmother who raised me, and my paternal aunt who thought of me as her son. But their deaths had nowhere near as heavily an effect on me as my dog\u2019s death. In my life this is the first inside dog of mine that I actually saw the dead body of and buried myself. It hit me like a giant truck. I haven\u2019t cried like that in so long and it hurt so much. Yesterday was the most emotionally taxing day of my whole life. I never let myself be too sad over death because I knew it was always there. But this was so sudden and I feel like it was my fault. If I let her back inside or was more mindful to check on her she\u2019d still be here. I had gotten too comfortable in the idea of her always sitting on the porch or only being in the backyard. It was pretty evident that she had grown away from going into the road. I\u2019ve let her outside to potty on her own so many times now that I had completely forgotten the possibility of this even happening she was practically immortal in my eyes. But it all came crashing down yesterday. The only thing different about yesterday was that she wasn\u2019t wearing her collar. She was my baby brother\u2019s best friend. They took a shine to each other as soon as she showed up on our doorstep 4 years ago. And I think what is hurting me the most is the guilt I feel for being the one whose fault it was for putting her in the position to be in danger. I destroyed a part of my family, I killed my brother\u2019s best friend, I broke my family\u2019s hearts. I\u2019m so scared of how this is going to affect my brother, because he was already traumatized from my hospitalization and near death back in December. And one of the biggest things he took solace in was our chihuahua. He told me so many times that he wouldn\u2019t know what to do if he ever lost her. And I was the one responsible. I killed her. If I let her back inside sooner she\u2019d be here and everyone would still be happy. My body feels so heavy and weak. If I wasn\u2019t here she still would be. I didn\u2019t deserve the second chance at life I was given. All I ended up doing was damaging my family.\n\nI felt like there was some sort of ray of hope because I looked into pet cloning. I know the result won\u2019t be the same dog, but basically a twin that was born later. But the company only accepts samples within 5 days post mortem and the fee is $1,600, but the express fee is $500 and with being out of work and worrying about hospital bills I can\u2019t afford either option in time. I don\u2019t want to get rid of the sample and give up because this felt like a light at the end of an endless black void. I promised my brother that I would make it up to him one day and this is what I hoped to pursue. Even if I could send in the sample it would still take forever for me to afford to pay for the actual cloning itself. But it was a goal that I am willing to pursue. But I had to make the hard decision to give up earlier today and got rid of the sample.\n\nI don\u2019t know how to accept this as reality and move on. It hurts so much and I can\u2019t even imagine how the rest of my family feels. I\u2019ve never felt this before, and it is so awful.", "subreddit": "GriefSupport"}

When I was starting out my career in India, I made a good friend - A. He was ambitious, had the passion to make his own rags to riches story and he even did it. When my then boyfriend and me broke up, A became a part of his friend circle, ex-bf even stayed with him for a while. We lost what we had, but we kept in touch...keeping tabs on each other. I moved on, got married and left the country.  Sporadic phone calls became messages and got fewer with every passing year.\n\nI messaged him the other day and his wife (I didn't even know he got married) replied to me and said that he died. I  immediately reprimanded 'him' for being silly and then messaged a couple of common friends - who I have also lost touch with.  They confirmed it. He died because his liver gave up, he had become an alcoholic.\n\nI'm sitting here, in another continent, thinking how did this even happen. How did this ambitious person come to choose alcohol for support. Did he keep bad company? Was alcoholism in his family? The few messages I didn't respond to, were those a cry for help? Does it matter? Why did he get married? Did the Indian society and expectations that it set burden him with too much? Where did he go off the track that he had made for himself? \n\nIn a way what has hit me the most is how I have lost touch with people of my past. How moving away from my country, getting busy making my life has taken me away from the people who were a part of making me who I am today. I know its inevitable, it happens and it is partly my fault - I should have put in more effort but it still bothers me. \n\nAnd then I think that I am being selfish and thinking of myself at a time when I should be thinking about A's family and wife and his friends who were there when he chose the path to destruction and couldn't help him. \n\nThat's it I guess.

He was 27 and the light of my mother's life.  She always said that she didn't have favorites but he was the first born, way smarter and better looking than me, and like her in a lot of ways.  Right after we found out, she quit her job right away.  She keeps telling me that God hates her and she must not have been meant to be happy.  It's extremely heartbreaking to hear all of this.  When I am leaving to go out with my friends, she will say stuff like ,\"please come home alive because I already have one kid dead and I don't need another one.\" She can't even go to the grocery store because she fears that someone is going to say something to her about him or someone who doesn't know what happened will ask.  We chose to have a private church service and small lunch afterwards for close family and his friends.  She could barely keep it together during that.  I try to get her out and do things but everything reminds her of him.  We took a yoga class together a week ago and the girl in front of us was wearing his a t-shirt that had his university's name on it and she started crying then had to leave the room.  We are going on a vacation soon and she said that we aren't allowed to take family pictures on the trip because we will never be a whole family again. She has never had any lost anyone close to her in her life, except her dad to cancer but he was in his 70's and that was almost 30 years ago.  She told me this morning that she will never be happy ever again and will cry each day when she wakes up.  I'm not really sure if there is anything I can do to help her.  \n\nPart of me is really angry at my brother and I keep thinking wondering why he did this to us but the other part of me is thinking that this is what he wanted and he was in so much pain to the point where he couldn't move on.

She has been stage 4 and officially terminal for over 5.  She has tried a lot of experimental treatments that have extended her life expectancy, but she is at the end of the line.\n\nAlthough she's had some upticks, overall things have gradually gone downhill.  Updates I've given other people have evolved from, \"She is in good spirits and still working...\" to \"and still working part time,\" to \"but not able to work anymore, but having fun training her dog,\" to \"she is eligible for hospice care.\"\n\nI feel like with her age and the length of her illness, people expect her to recover, and honestly she isn't going to.  We are past the medical miracle possibility and into needing Jesus to come down from heaven.  I feel like I'm expected to give good news when people ask how she is doing, because that's what they want to hear.  Of course, some people have special cures that I'm supposed to make her take that will solve everything.  My favorite is a person who thinks her mom's well water cures cancer, because her mom got better while drinking the water...after starting chemo to treat a form of breast cancer that was highly likely to respond to chemo.\n\nI told my boss at the beginning of the school year that I would probably lose her this year.  They were thinking before Christmas.  I arranged emergency child care with friends.  And we are lucky that she is still around.  I'm glad - we all just want a little more time, right?\n\nBut as a result, I feel like people have already either moved on or are still in denial.  That my support system is just tired of hearing about it.  They probably would be happy to listen...but you get a long, boring post here as a result of me not feeling like reaching out to a friend.\n\nMy sister is my only sibling, and due to some other stuff going on, my family has gotten smaller.  I feel like I'm going to be all alone to deal with everything, and then just pile it on my son when I die.  I was hoping to have more children, but am not sure if that is going to work out.  I really, really liked having a sister.  I always wanted to marry someone from a huge family to have more.  (Married an only child.)  I feel like I'm setting up my child to be alone.  He is 2, and loves babies and his \"friends.\"  Yes, I know he's going to be okay...just need to adjust my view.  I had a lot of extended family that was close growing up and was very close to my sister even though we fought a lot.\n\nI've had some other really, really bad stuff happen in the last few months plus a lot of normal bad stuff, like needing to replace expensive appliances the same month my car breaks down.  Yes, I'm in therapy - I'm trying to stay not messed up so I can be a good parent.  My therapist has diagnosed me with a bad case of \"your life sucks right now.\"  (Okay, she phrased it a little differently.  She has no sense of humor.)\n\nAnyway, I think my sister had just had a mini-stroke when I called her today.  (She's had them before and more are expected.)  She wasn't making sense, but didn't seem aware that she was using the wrong words.  I called my parents to get in touch with the nurse that visits her (she's still in her own home...long story) and when they contacted her a few minutes later, she was very coherent.  \n\nSo nothing new (it's never anything new - just a little worse each day forever,) but just a reminder that soon I'm not going to have a sister anymore.  Soon I'm going to have to talk and talk and talk to people about her being gone.  I'm going to have to explain to my toddler son who loves his aunt that he won't see her again, that he has no aunts, uncles, cousins, siblings...\n\nShort version: I'm sad and feel like no one cares (even though I know they do.)", "subreddit": "GriefSupport"}

I have been writing a lot about my mother who past away some years ago, and I want to dedicate some time explaining how I feel about losing a great friend, not physically, but perhaps emotionally, for since he has gotten married, I have lost our six hour walks that scoured the landscape of the city in order to mend the emotional landscapes that pain procures.\n\nI remember how I met him, the same way we always form our conversations: half argument, full consideration, and part tough love but always with emotion and care. He made me cry and made me feel like I had a real brother; and we both chased the same lady, which left both of us. He once called me his guardian angel as I feel my mother is to me now.\n\nBecause I am dealing with marital strife now, and am alone, I guess I am in a different emotional-reflective mode, one that goes in and out of clarity and rationalism only to succumb the torrents of repressed and revealed emotions that make me feel as if I am going in and out of bright and sharp colors.\n\nWith this close friend, I could speak in different tropes, those that were ethical and those that were not, make those mistakes and feel safe, guided into a better vision to understand the world and all its suffering, but I think now I feel some of that old solace here, in this space, where I feel in this black field many are joining their emotional hands to connect.\n\nWhy did my mother have to go and not my father? Oh, that is dark thought, and I am sorry; oh, why does my wife deserve a lovingful mother, great career, and support while I have to figure it all out? I am okay with this fate now, for reading the many stories here has shown me that I have been alone for too long. \n\nDavid. No last name. Let's call him David. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nDavid: You are obsessed. You never loved her. \n\nEude: Ah. Okay. But, you too; eh, what was it then, for you?\n\nDavid: \\[No answer\\]\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI remember we talked about her, let's call her Dionysus, the girl we both chased like Quixote to Dulcinea. We were walking along the onyx paved suburb streets in Austin that hugged an untouched forrest. \n\n  \nDavid: Man. You remember Lawn Mower man?\n\nEude: Yeah. He was cool. \n\nDavid: Man. I saw him, the last time, dead and on the floor next to the street sign.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI had went to college for too long, wasting away learning things that only kept me at bay from the real things that mattered, like understanding love and mortality, two themes that every soul will spend the better part of their life understanding.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe best memory that night was walking on the esplanade, noticing a few cars hug the curb slowly in the middle of the night as we carried our camera equipment and talked about Europe and his experiences, which were always plenty and lively.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nDavid: So, I visited Dionysus in Spain, but I couldn't kiss her though the chance was there: I realized that I didn't have those feelings for her.\n\nEude: \\[Man, such a tease\\] Damn. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhat are these feelings? They swim around us quickly and fiercely till they eventually, thank God, tire and hibernate perhaps till waken. They are like muses and teases. They are like spectres and angels, leaving us confused as to whether if they are helping or distracting. But, it seems that they are telling us something beyond the evolutionary, that love is all that is needed.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI think I have some more time, energy, so I'll permit myself a bit more so I can understand through writing what is going on with me. It was my birthday today, but unfortunately I wasn't able to celebrate and my wife left me. I know it seems hard to fathom, perhaps unpleasant to hear, and all I have been doing lately was reading theories and fiction because I felt that was my calling to something I hope to lead me to where I need to be, perhaps here. Lately, this has been a safe space, though I have been writing more cryptic, for as of late, I have been scared of life. I am scared of so many things my friend, and if I take a Raslonikov edge, I am sorry, because I don't feel too much like me anymore.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI too like Balzac, perhaps, get caught up in fits, like Turner and his rabid water-coloring, like Giacometti and his spear like statues, something in the visceral provides that immediacy that fools me into control, fleeting power, a rush. Oh to be twenty again, I think for I am thirty-five year, past my mother and grandmother's sixty. I was an idealist telling myself that I would be on the top of the world when I hit one-hundred years, perhaps a decade past, when the two matriarchs of love from life passed so shortly, so harshly to make me a nihilist, cynic, deplorable person. I felt like an infant ripped from his mother, violently by death, disease, pain, suffering, confusion, change, laughter, paranoia, fear, sex, appearances of love, similitudes, gestures of knowledge, prototypes and models of supposed care, etc.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMother: \\[Looks intently at the wall papered wall\\] Why would you let someone into this world of pure suffering?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy mom told me this once. Her mother was nearly killed by her father's loaded revolver pointed at her mother's temple while he came home, once again, drunk and enraged.

I feel like this is an important forum to a lot of people. I have posted on the cancer forum and received some ways to support a close loved one several months ago. Thankfully, this person is still with us. Then someone else who was close to both of us passed away. I knew this person for my entire life, and lived with them for a few years only half a decade ago. However, we were not very close, and she did not even like me for about half of my life.\n\nThe thing is, I have developed a depression worse than I have had in two and a half years (it is recurring), despite life being increasingly better. Because we were not close, I am not certain why my depression would be this bad. Do you think it could be her passing away, depression by itself, or maybe both? I am trying to make sure this does not happen again by finding out why I am depressed.\n\nIt is odd though, because despite behaving depressed, I do not feel so. Mostly it is a feeling of not really being able to identify my feelings, as thought I have none. Although, I feel happy at times and maintain principles and consideration. One thought that continues to come to mind is that it seems like with one person having cancer and the other dying, that everything leaves and what is left is an absence that is the return of reality. Maybe I am missing something. \n\nAnyways, thanks for reading.", "subreddit": "GriefSupport"}

We were very close friends for seven years but in the year before he died I resented him for some things he did. I had just forgiven him literally 4 days before he died and our last interaction was me giving him an Oreo cookie in physics class three days before his death.\n\nWhen he died my friend called me to tell me he was dead and I was shocked but I did not cry until later that night (and the next night) I broke down but I was ok after a couple minutes. For the most part after that I was ok and I didn't cry often about it except maybe once every 1.5 months. Now recently if I see things that remind me of him I try everything to focus on something else but if I am alone I lose it and start crying and it happens more often now. I miss the dude so much and sometimes I think he will just walk in to the physics class like normal and we will learn about electromagnetism or I will see him in the hallway and wave like it used to be or he will go to the robotics meeting with his lanyard hanging out of his pocket but then I realized that it's impossible because he is dead. Or we will hang around in the machine shop like we used to sometimes but that can't happen because he is dead. I have these thoughts momentarily but then I remember he is dead but I still don't quite fully understand why he won't be in the halls. It's like I get it but I don't really believe it, you know?\n\nEveryone else has moved on from his death though, they were all crying in the first week but now they're ok. I'm pretty sure I'm supposed to be ok now too but I read somewhere that if you had mixed feelings to the person who died then your grief will be different for some reason. I did have some mixed feelings before he died but before that we were best friends and he used to sit at my lunch table every day. He still thought we were good friends and we were though not as good as he thought but I forgave him before he died anyhow.\n\nI have lost plenty of loved ones like all but 1 grandparent and many uncles and aunts and usually when you hear about it you cry and then after up to 2 months you are mostly back to normal. But it has been 6 months and I miss him more and more and I miss the good times we had in classes and stuff over the years. He hasn't been online in steam in 8 months and sometimes I hope I will see a little notification saying he is playing Skyrim or something. He loved Skyrim.\n\nI want some help from my friends but I can't ask them because they all moved on now. I don't know who else is still upset.\n\nI miss him", "subreddit": "GriefSupport"}

A year after my mom.", "author": "Enigmasystem", "self_text": "Sorry if this is so long, I need to get this off my chest I feel like exploding. Today I lost my dad. Almost exactly a year after I lost my mom to leukemia. \n\n\nI can\u2019t deal with it. I was joking with him on the phone and planning to go to a market together the next weekend. Making plans to visit that icecream shop with his favourite flavour together. He was doing active sport, tennis, cycling. Was eating healthy. He renovated his backgarden into a beautiful, blooming place to rest. Sure after my moms dead we all had a tough time. Especially my dad. They had just retired from their jobs and were looking forward to a lot of traveling and enjoying life. If anyone was to survive anything it was my dad. When he hugged me everything was alright. He gave me such a sense of security and home. He was always joking with us. When we played games he would take it easy on us and not taking it easy if that makes sense. And now he is gone forever. I got a call from a friend of his. Said he didn\u2019t show up for their tennis match and when he drove by his home and knocked on the door there was no answer. Had a bad feeling then. So I called my sister and asked if she knew something, maybe he was out, going for a walk or in the garden and didn\u2019t hear the phone. My sister also thought it was weird so she decided to drive to him. Said she would contact me as soon as  when she got there. My feeling got worse when I looked at the time ticking away and thinking she\u2019s got to be there already. And she would have called if everything was ok to calm me down. Then the phone rang and I knew it when my partner answered it. The colour of his face faded away. I knew it. I knew it. I knew it. \u201aYour dad.. is dead.\u2018 Was all he could say. Since then I\u2018ve been zoning out. I can\u2019t come to terms with it. He was lying on the couch in the living room like he was only taking a nap as he often did. He looked like he was sleeping. I wanted to shake him awake and when I touched his shoulder he was so cold. So so cold. The police think he was gone in his sleep. I really hope so. I hope he had no pain. I hope he didn\u2019t feel alone. I wish I could have said goodbye. Tell him how much I love him. How grateful I am for everything he has done for me. Us. The only thing that kind of gives my thoughts some rest is that hopefully if there is something like an afterlife that he and my mom are happy together again. The house, our home where we grew up feels so empty. Everything is looking like time has stopped. There are the leftovers from his lunch still sitting on the table. His tennis bag was packed. I\u2018ll never know if he\u2019d just gotten up from bed or if he was preparing to go to sleep. I miss him. So much. It hurts so much and I don\u2019t feel anything at the same time. I had so many wishes and imagined him to be there at so many events taking place in our lives. Making photos and making mischief. Playing with his grandchildren and being a awesome grandfather. It would have suited him so well. How can anyone be prepared for something like this. I stayed at the deathbed of my mom and had to decide to turn off the machines. I kind of knew it then and tried to prepare myself. It\u2019s impossible. This huge hole after my moms passing just got wider. And I don\u2019t feel like it will ever heal. It hurts. It hurts. It hurts. I feel so sad but I can\u2019t cry. I feel numbed and torn. Please give your parents a hug from me and let them know you care about them. I love you dad.", "subreddit": "GriefSupport"}

I found it pretty incredible that she was willing to mimic different art styles, since it doesn\u2019t seem like a common thing, as someone following over 300 artists. She was pretty friendly and finished my commission pretty quickly.\n\nWe kept exchanging a lot of notes between that time and after. Enough to where she told me some personal stuff about her life, and to come to me the last couple of months to tell me how a Deviantart user I know, was getting impatient. Ignoring how she had constantly kept her watchers up to date, and that she would be busy trying to juggle with commissions while trying to finish her dissertation.\n\nThe same guy who complained eventually did get his work done, and disgustingly started complimenting her, even though he pmed her awful things. Besides him, I had to made up most of her clientele, caring enough about this whole artist to client relationship of ours to help her get settled in as much as possible on Deviantart.\n\nI can tell just from being on this site just how hard it is for an artist to get some kind of following and I did manage to get her a small one. It was a really nice back and forth communication, and she appreciated my efforts enough to follow some of the advice I gave her in trying to cater to certain audiences and also seeing me as a \u2018godfather\u2019 in her life. Never really had something that personal with an artist, so our relationship really meant a lot to me.\n\nI was the only client she had to finish commissions for, and I\u2019m a pretty patient enough person. There\u2019s tons of other artists around to wait on as well, so however long she wanted to take didn\u2019t matter much to me. I hadn\u2019t really been able to talk to her through notes since sometime last year since she stopped replying, but I knew she read what support I did try and offer here and there.\n\nShe finished her school enough some months back to return from a hiatus, and I regret that I didn\u2019t really try and talk to her around that time, having read a note today from a relative of hers, informing me that she recently died on Tuesday from a heart attack. I\u2019m supposed to graduate university a week from today, and I was hoping that when I had gotten a better job, I would have been able to commission her more. So it was really sad to hear the news.\n\nShe was a really kind person and quite possibly the best artist and client relationship I\u2019ve ever had while commissioning art.

Then last October, my grandmother. All of these have hit me and with little coping time in between. My first real experience with death happened a year prior when one of my best high school friends past suddenly. So again little time in between to fully understand and process.\nHowever, the one that has hit me the most is the loss of my grandma who was also my best friend since I was a child. \n\n(I want to note that I have never been one to deal with my feelings. And to be honest I have no idea how.)\n\nAll I have inside me is anger, at least that is the only emotion I recognize. I am either happy (maybe fake happy) or short with people I love. I have little tolerance over my loved ones annoyances and when I drink I get filled with rage. I hate coming home because I do not want to deal with my personal life. My work life is great because I can be someone distracted and distant from the reality of it all. \n\nI don't want to continue to be this way but I have no idea how. I want to be able to process my feelings but I can't seem to reach anything except anger. There is nothing deeper than that. False. I do know there is more than that but I can't find it or I don't want to find it. \n\nAny advice or of anyone would share their experiences would be nice.

I made a few calls of help.My friends picked up and gave me advice and tried to calm me. It didn't matter.No one was there for me in that moment other than myself.

Starting seeing a psychologist. Going to see a psychiatrist on May 21. My PCP prescribed Buspar. I haven\u2019t taken it yet. I probably will try my first dose tonight. She warned me it\u2019s only 50/50 if it works. She wants to start Lexapro but I\u2019m terrified of the side effects. At this point, I\u2019m not sure if I\u2019ll have a choice. I am so incredibly sad all the time now. My thoughts don\u2019t turn off. I downloaded the Calm app and have tried some guided meditation. It does help a bit. I started attending GriefShare weekly. \n\nI just need to vent. From a girl who is so happy usually with a bubbly personality \u2014 i don\u2019t know this person and why this is happening now.

I was sad and I cried but I felt generally okay with it.\n\nNow, two weeks later, today has been awful. I saw something that reminded me of her this morning. Her before the dementia, the person I grew up around. And it has just seemed to unlock a new level of grief within me today, one I've never felt. I am just so fucking sad that she's gone. I know she needed to go, but today is the first day I've really felt the impact of the fact that it's happened. My heart is breaking. I've just been hit with intense waves of grief and pain all day and it aches so much deep within me.\n\nIt all happened so fast and slow at the same time. Her dementia had began to develop for years, but up until about two months ago, her health was relatively fine. My grandpa, her husband of 60 years, died about a year and a half ago.

And that's impossible to accept. \n\nI know I just have to accept the feeling and go through it and that eventually I'll fall asleep and tomorrow will be a new day and soon enough, those days will have occurred enough times that it becomes less totally crushing to acknowledge to myself.

I regressed into myself after she died, never really grieved properly or processed it completely. I was already a quiet kid, but I spent  most of my teen and young adult  years being angry or forelorn. It took a long time to  finally accept our mother /daughter relationship, (or lack there of) and it got to a point where I  felt I was finally moving on and forward.13 years later I meet my fiance, he had two lovely little girls already by another woman. They shared custody for a long time, she had valiantly fought cancer for six years, and finally last year in July she succumbed to it. She was the exact opposite of my mother; FEIRCEly loved her children, caring, and kind. My fiance and I took full custody of the kids, and I love them with all my heart, I accept them as my own, I will most likely never have children of my own. They are 5 and seven. Due to their mother's health, she had prepared them well for the time where she might die, and because of that they are very well adjusted and amazing little girls.

He had been pretty sick for a long time, but not the kind of sick where he was stuck in a bed. He had diabetes, and was struggling through heart failure. He had many medications, and was not good at taking care of himself. He even lost his toes on one foot to diabetes. I stayed close. I didn't want to move out, I wanted to stay and be with him. There were times when he WAS stuck in bed. He'd spend a month or two at the hospital during the nice summer. He was so miserable during those times.. and he DESERVED this summer. HE DESERVED IT.\n\nMy partner and I had been cooking for him, cleaning for him, and helping him with his medication pretty frequently these last four years.. although he had been sick and had medication to take most of my life, so I was used to helping him test his sugars, and take his insulin etc. We knew he wasn't healthy, but no one saw this coming. He had a heart attack and his arteries clogged in his heart. I didn't know it, but he confessed that he hadn't been taking one of his medications that keeps water off his heart for maybe 2 weeks. He passed away at the hospital.  He said the pharmacy lines were too long.\n\nI'm so hurt. I'm devastated. Beyond devastated. There's nothing I can type to describe what is going on inside my heart and my mind. I would have gone to the pharmacy and waited as long as it took if I knew. It hurts so much more, knowing we were caring for him.. living with him.. we were so close and I didn't know, and I couldn't help him because he didn't communicate things clearly. I feel guilt over this, I feel like I could have done something, or like it's my fault because I didn't make sure...because I wasn't paying enough attention.\n\nMy dad and I were VERY close! He was literally my BEST FRIEND! We saw each other every day. We ate together frequently ! I cooked for him when I could! (We live upstairs, he lived downstairs.)  He gave me advice! He drove me around places when he didn't have to (I don't drive, and I've been perfectly fine with the bus. I was never pushy about asking for rides.) Since he was retired, he loved being useful and driving us around.\n\nHe loved to ride motorcycles, and go boating. He loved being outside, and starting new projects. He loved classic rock, and blues! We played guitar together! He bought me my amazing electric ukulele!! We would laugh and sing and play board games and drink tea in the sun!! We were fixing up his boat so we could go out on it on my birthday next month!\n\nOh my birthday next month.... ohh my birthday.. next month.. I just.. I don't know what to do or think.. I was SO excited to spend it just me, my partner, and my dad. A quiet family birthday! Out on the boat... Have a nice dinner. Eat some frozen yogurt. I can't believe this is happening.\n\nI'm home alone today for the first time since he passed. It's still raw. It's still fresh. I'm in too much pain. I loved my dead immeasurably. Everyone did. He was just a hilarious loving person. He was even joking on his way to the hospital. The doctors that were working on him knew him and loved him for his outgoing personality. \n\nEverything is gripping me so tight. I've been going to therapy for about 2 years now for anxiety and other mental health issues. I've been practicing mindfulness in all my sessions, so I know breathing exorcises. I know grounding techniques, and all that jazz. But this is too much. \n\nYesterday I was numb, and it hit my partner. I was able to smile with a friend. I was able to have some good thoughts. Today is just the opposite. I'm howling, screaming, crying. I'm on my knees. I can't breathe. The fact that I'll never be able to see my dad again. I'll never be able to hug him again. I'll never be able to laugh with him, hold his hand, play guitar together, or go on that boat. We never got to go on that new boat we were fixing. My head is pounding, my throat is dry and hurting, my chest feels like it's going to explode.\n\nHow do I go on? How do I get through this? I've never lost a parent before, or anyone this close to me.  \nI'm so scared I'm terrified of the future. I don't know where I'll have to go, or if I'll be able to keep his house.

She ended up becoming our dog when he could no longer give her the care she needed. She lived to be 17 years old and was the best little wiener dog I ever knew! She would literally act like she was on her death bed, and the next week, she\u2019d be bouncing around like a puppy. She was so resilient. I said my goodbyes to her probably around 5 times since she was 12, or so. And it always made me feel like she\u2019s live forever because each time, she\u2019d bounce back. Anyways, when she was declining, she would have seizures, she never had any traction on the floors, she would cry out in pain, and couldn\u2019t see. It was really really tough to witness all of that. I\u2019m tearing up right now thinking about it. She lost a lot of weight and couldn\u2019t hear, also. I hated it. When it was time to put her down, I remember saying goodbye and she wouldn\u2019t even kiss me or look at me (because she couldn\u2019t see me or hear me), and it about broke my heart. My parents took her to the vet and came back 30 minutes later with a large cardboard box with her inside. I remember going down in the basement as my dad was transferring her body into a plastic container, and I just saw her limp body and it freaked me out... I could also tell it was really difficult for my dad. He brought the box up moments later, and I remember touching her body and it was still a little warm. It was so unreal and really fucked with me. I\u2019ve had her my entire life (I\u2019m 22) and to know that she was just gone, absolutely broke me. She was also my last connection to my papaw, who had died years before. I mourned her death, almost crying every day for at least 6 months. For me, it seemed like everyone else got over her death pretty quickly, which made me angry and I didn\u2019t know how they did that. I miss her so much. \n\nAnyways, fast forward to tonight, i was getting ribbon out of the guest room closet and saw this felt birthday hat/headband. I immediately had a flashback of the time we put it on Maddie\u2019s back on her 15th birthday. I grabbed it out of the closet and examined it. I saw it covered in her hair and I just lost it. I bawled. It was so emotional because it\u2019s literally the only thing I\u2019ve found in such a long time that still has her hair on it.Toys, brushes, beds are gone). I had flashbacks of her walking in our kitchen and doing things only she would do. It was like I just lost her. And I kept thinking, \u201cwe forgot about her\u201d. It really weighed on me. I\u2019m having a hard time right now. Most people I talk to say that this isn\u2019t normal, but I feel lost without her presence.\n\nAny advice or relatable stories to help me? \n\nAlso sorry for typos or things that may have not made sense.", "subreddit": "GriefSupport"}

Growing up was hard and my bio dad left when I was 6 - I never heard from him again, and my mom had some reservations with me throughout my childhood because I think I reminded her of him. Her relationships were dysfunctional and there was a lot of fear at home - but my grandpa was my safe place. The only one who I didn\u2019t doubt loved me. \nHe had the hardest life growing up in an orphanage in Russia during the USSR, he brought my mom and family here as refugees - not even knowing where they would go when the plan landed, not knowing any English. He was brave. My life here is only because of his bravery. But he was tormented and an intense alcoholic from his teenage years. He could be a mean drunk but his natural state was the most beautiful and selfless soul. The past 4 or 5 years he really started to deteriorate so my mom, sister and I would go to him ever 11 days or so (2.5 hr trip each way or we would have gone more) and spend time cleaning his apartment, buying him groceries, laundry etc. \nHe had so many close calls (the alcohol didn\u2019t help) and he hates phones so he didn\u2019t like to use the cell we got him so every time we went we were fearful that he would be gone(idk it is so hard for me to use the word dead now) and this Thursday it happened... we went back   In just 7 days this time because he wasn\u2019t feeling well last week &amp; we found him. His body was already decomposing so they wouldn\u2019t let us say goodbye. \nI am so so lost, and I do t know how to handle this pain. I keep it together around me family for them but I can\u2019t stop thinking of it. \nMy worst nightmare was that he would fall and not be able to get help and we found him on the floor. I keep thinking of what his last moments must of been. If he was drunk. If it was fast, if it was slow. If he was in pain. \nI feel so much anger that this beautiful man that I loved more than anything died on the ground alone. I am so angry with whatever higher power would let such an amazing person have such a hard life and then not even let him have compassion or dignity in his death. \nI have so much more I want to say but I don\u2019t know how to put the words together.\nI just want to know where you are grandpa.

It was horrible, honestly. The first year wasn\u2019t so bad because even though she was on very intense chemo her body still handled it well and she had the strength/energy to do a lot of things still. But the second year was tough. Over time, I think the chemo weakens your body more and the cancer kept spreading albeit slowly. She was extremely lethargic and we had trips planned that she enjoyed a lot but if she wasn\u2019t on a trip she mostly just sat around all day and even developed bed sores from sitting. I think her own mortality was getting to her as well and she was very depressed. Having that warning that she was going to die was kind of nice though because in those two years I got to visit her a lot and everything both of us needed to say was said before her passing.\n\nWhen it actually happened I was devastated. It was a very dark day for me. My fianc\u00e9 and I had moved up our wedding two years to June so that she would be able to be there. Obviously she won\u2019t be there anymore but she did a lot of the planning and we\u2019re still going through with the wedding because it\u2019ll still be very special. The first few days it was hard to think about this though. My fianc\u00e9 asked if I was okay and still wanted to go through with the wedding and I almost felt annoyed that he could be thinking about something so happy when I was feeling so sad. \n\nI flew up to my mom\u2019s house with all my siblings that I am very close with. It was nice to be all together, put our phones away for the weekend, and cry together. We told stories, went through my mom\u2019s jewelry and clothing to keep things for ourself. It was an extremely emotional time and the grief I felt took a toll on my body, I had body aches and pains and just felt very weak.\n\nNow I\u2019m home and back to work and I feel kind of....okay? But I feel bad about feeling okay! I mean, I\u2019m not perfect but I\u2019m able to get dressed for work and have fun with my coworkers and humor is a big way for me to cope so I tell jokes about my mom\u2019s death. I worry that everyone thinks with the jokes and my normal (not super sad) attitude that I wanted her to die or that I\u2019m just not sad enough, I guess? \n\nI do feel relief, which I know is normal, because she\u2019s finally out of her suffering. In a perfect world she never would have got cancer but even from the time she diagnosed it was very advanced so I am relieved that she finally getting some rest. I do feel sad but not as sad as I did initially or as sad as I think I should be? I just feel...okay. Not super happy but not super sad either. I\u2019m able to think about the wedding and I feel excited for it but also feel guilty for feeling happy. \n\nIs this all normal? Why don\u2019t I feel so sad anymore?

I know she wants to celebrate being a mom with her kids after all that is what today is about.

However, I politely responded that my husband was on his normal sleep schedule (he works nights) and we wouldn\u2019t be able to make but to \u201cEnjoy the cookout\u201d. The response, \u201cOk. We\u2019ll miss visiting with you.\u201d I keep trying to tell myself that it's not up to her to acknowledge my mother's death or my grief but I just can't help feeling so angry at what feels a like a blatant disregard for what today might feel like for me.\n\nSo now I'm just sad that my mom isn't here, angry that there was no consideration/acknowledgement about what today might mean for me, relieved that my husband isn't awake which means we don't have to go, and guilty that I'm angry and relieved.\n\nI really just wanted a quiet day where I got to pretend I didn\u2019t know what today was.

{"post_id": "boc8xu", "created_utc": 1557797053, "title": "I was not a good daughter.", "author": "coelacanth-fins", "self_text": "My momma died from cancer on April 27th of this year.\n\nI am 22 years old, and these past few years I was not a good daughter. \n\nI didn't make enough trips home, I didn't send her enough texts, and I didn't make enough calls to hear her voice. \n\nI needed to get these words down to try and make sense of how I am feeling. For a little context--my mother was gone during most of my early childhood. She battled with an opiate addiction, and left me to be raised by my abusive father. To her credit, no one knew the abuse was happening except me. It wasn't until she died that I was able to let go of the negative feelings that I had toward her for leaving me with him--these should have been let go a long time ago.\n\nShe was able to overcome her battle with addiction and came back into my life during high school. We were able to have what I believe was a good relationship. It was never nurturing as mother-daughter relationships should be, but it was good. We became the closest we had ever been during this time, until she was diagnosed with two brain tumors and underwent several surgeries to remove them. Her personality changed as a result of the surgeries, and I felt like I had to start all over again rebuilding our relationship. This was so incredibly difficult for me, as it took a long time to cultivate the relationship that we had built after she came back into my life.\n\nAs expected, our relationship never returned to what it was. I was not angry with her, but there was distance between us that wasn't there before. I moved an hour and a half away to start my undergraduate degree. She began working and going to school to fulfill her dream of becoming a certified peer support specialist to help others battling with addiction. It seemed as though we continued to drift farther apart--her not wanting to intrude on my new life and me not caring enough to make it better.\n\nDuring my last year of undergrad she was diagnosed with gastrointestinal stromal tumors. This is a relatively rare form of cancer, and she required several surgeries to remove the rapidly growing tumors from her stomach and intestines. I was not focused on the magnitude of the severity of this diagnosis, as I was about to begin graduate school, and I was too worried about passing the GRE and getting a graduate assistant position. \n\nThe surgeries were a relative success, and she began one of the only two forms of chemo used for this type of cancer. At the same time, I went head first into graduate school. For two years, I focused on nothing but working two jobs, being a graduate assistant, and keeping up with my classes. My entire life was graduate school. I only came home on holidays and birthdays, never staying long enough. I neglected to even send my momma text messages of support--one of the simplest, quickest things I could have done to show her that I loved her. \n\nThe day after I passed my master's thesis defense on March 21st, she found out the chemo was no longer slowing the progression of the cancer. I went home to be with her for the follow-up doctor's visit. She began the other form of chemotherapy in the hopes that it would work as long as the previous chemo. I thought everything would be like it was, and I went back to school to finish out the semester. I did not support her enough during this time.\n\nUnfortunately, a few days later she had to be admitted to the hospital for severe vomiting and confusion. We found out that the chemo was causing a condition called PRES, which is swelling in the brain. This swelling caused her to be very confused and affected her vision greatly. She made the decision to stop taking chemo. She progressed from the cancer wing of the hospital to hospice one week later, and she died after being in hospice for two weeks. \n\nI graduated with my master's degree on May 4th. My momma was not there to see me walk, and to see the accomplishment that kept me from supporting her when she needed it the most. I have had to learn in one of the worst ways possible that you cannot get back lost time. Sure, this is something everyone talks about in a cliched way. But it isn't until you feel sick when thinking about the time you cannot get back with someone you love, someone that needed you that it really resonates with you.

My gran and grandpa had an incredible relationship, and I have so many stories to treasure.\n\nBut there aren\u2019t any for my mom and dad. I don\u2019t know about before I came along (though I learnt from my uncle there were plenty instances of my mom lashing out at family members and causing difficult situations after they were married). \n\nMy uncle (dad\u2019s brother) is close and I\u2019m very lucky. We get on well, and I grew up with lots of dads side of the family around (moms side of the family are great, but we lived geographically very near to dads side).\n\nI had a lot in common with dad - in particular sporting interests (he was sport mad) and I shared that with him and my uncle too. We are all positive people really and very loving. My dad was an incredibly gentle soul.\n\nWhen being cared for, my mom would still shout and lose her rag. She told me recently that she always went in to apologise but I don\u2019t believe her.... I\u2019ve never once heard her apologise, only act overly nice or give the silent treatment after a blow up.\n\nWhen we were both my his side in the hospital, a little while before the end she brought up the fact that she knows she is a \u201cranter and raver, but it\u2019s just me, it\u2019s just my way of coping\u201d.\n\nI\u2019m still processing this. I don\u2019t know what to do with the information.\n\nI\u2019m so sad that I\u2019ve lost my lovely dad - but am so grateful for just how many people ah e been in touch with such kind words, all sayings what a gentleman he was, you have to go far to find a nicer guy, and lots of funny stories.\n\nIt makes me sad that my mom never seems to have any of these.\n\nShe is different with other people around. My boyfriend was her for a night. Mom has a tendency to interrupt people, and that doesn\u2019t change, but she\u2019s less argumentative when he\u2019s around. She would only shout at my dad (while he\u2019s hooked up to an oxygen tank barely able to breath) while I was there.\n\nShe admired herself that she would \u201ccajole\u201d him whatever that means. On his last holiday a number of years ago, I joined them for a few nights. He had a buggy then, and a part briefly stopped working. It wasn\u2019t his fault. She said \u201che\u2019s bloody useless\u201d. I said not to shout, he said \u201cyes she\u2019s always shouting\u201d. :-(\n\nAll of these memories swirling in my head.\n\nI\u2019ve been home with mom since it happened early Saturday. As mentioned it\u2019s just me and her in the house now. We were watching a crap news programme about Brexit today, and we add half hearted comments to the debate. I won\u2019t go into detail but our political differences came out and I knew it was a bad path. I just said I don\u2019t really want to get into it (in a nice way). \n\nThen she started telling a story about a certain politician (ok it\u2019s obvious it\u2019s Jeremy Corbyn but politics is so irrelevant here so please pleas keep politics out of replies if you can I\u2019d be so grateful)... all I said was it\u2019s a mistake to think I\u2019m his biggest fan (because of my age she thinks I am) but that a lot of stuff said about him isn\u2019t true. She then raised. Her voice \u201cI\u2019m sorry but I was there, you weren\u2019t around when he was marching trough the streets wearing a mask!\u201d \n\n\u201cAh? I wasn\u2019t where?\u201d\n\n\u201cAll those fascist Marxist matches he went on wearing those masks!\u201d\n\nI literally don\u2019t know what she means but the problem is the shouting at me not what she said. And the timing of it. I then went to another room and got really upset.... reminding me of my childhood basically.\n\nI\u2019m trying to deal with dad dying but also the difficulties in understanding my moms temperament.\n\nI know she\u2019s hurting too and I\u2019m trying really hard to be a good daughter.

I usually cry a little when it happens, then the moment is gone.\n\nToday, it was an old Facebook post that was brought back in \"On this day\".\n\nMay 13th, 2013. \n\nWe're in the car, driving past a Liquor Store.\n\nDad: People...they go to the liquor store...They drink too much and they get Sclerosis\n\nMe: It's cirrhosis dad.\n\nDad: They drink and they get Kirosize.\n\nMe: Cirrhosis, dad...\n\nDad, thinking for a second: They drink and they get cancer, for fuck's sake!\n\n\\---\n\nThis helps a lot. It helps seeing him as he was for 75 years and 6 months. Alive. Funny. Opiniated. Not dead, getting cold, cheeks caving in, eyes closed, on his hospital bed. Not with over-the-top make up, kind of peaceful, in his casket. No...interacting with me. Smiling, laughing, crying (as I'm doing right now). Alive.\n\nI'm at peace with him passing. I'm still sad, and I will be for a long time. But i,m getting better. I'm feeling better.\n\nTold my shrink the other day that I've never felt better in a long time. That I felt that I needed for him to pass away to finally start feeling better about myself, about my place in the world. \n\nI told her that I knew that he'd always have my back, and that in a way, it robbed me of some confidence. That I needed him to make sure that everything was going to be okay, even though I just turned 43 years old. \n\nShe smiled, got up to get a sheet of paper, that she handed to me. \"read point 4 and 5\".\n\nIt was about acceptance and seeing the silver lining in the situation. About reconciling the immense sadness of losing someone with the fact that life can be good, and even in some aspects, better without them.\n\n\\---\n\nI'm an only child. My dad loved my mom with all his heart, and from what I understood, she didn't love him that way. She had found a good, reliable guy and that was okay for her.  \n\nMy dad told me that when I was 2, he had packed our stuff and was about to leave her. But he ultimately stayed and they had a long, almost uneventful marriage. I was the glue that kept them together. Their sole reason to keep being a couple. \n\nWe had a special and strong bond, dad and I. \n\nA year or so before he died, I called him. I was lost and distressed. I had just learned that the IVF treatments we were doing didn't work. I, his only son, wouldn't have a kid of my own. Having a grandkid was something that had him hanging on, even though he was sick. \"I'm going to be there on my grandkid's first school day, standing up proud!\"\n\nThat phone call was tough for both of us. He didn't really know what to say, I was crying my eyes out. I knew he was sad too. \n\nA week later, he was admitted and would spend almost the rest of the year in the hospital, with a few days breaks here and there. \n\n\\--\n\nWe had the chance to talk, alone, for four hours, 6 weeks before he passed. He was in the ICU because the doctors thought he had an infection or something. We spoke about a lot of stuff, we laughed. We cried too. He told me about his bucket list: I want to see your house, and I want to clean out the garage, so you don't have to...Neither one of us mentioned that it could be \"THE TALK\", but in a way it was.  It was the last significant conversation I had with him.\n\nThat time, and the last time I saw him. \n\nMom and I went to visit him at the hospital on january second. He was at the dialysis room, so we squeezed in there. While my mom was speaking to him, he moved his head so that he could see me, sitting behind her. He did a kissing motion with his lips, along with a head nod, asking for me to come close. I kissed him on the cheek. \n\nWe spoke of sweet nothings. I showed him pictures and videos of our new cat, of the renovated house that he so wanted to see, of my huge year-end bonus at work. He was getting tired so after 15 minutes, we decided to leave. I tucked him in, because he was cold. I kissed him goodbye, caressed his head and walked away. \n\nAfter a few feet, I stopped and looked back at him. He smiled. I came back, gave him another kiss and left. \n\nI think we both knew this was the real last time\n\nAnd he was ready, he knew I'd be ok without him.\n\n\\----\n\nA week and a half later, I was about to drive to my hometown to spend the day with my mom and visit my dad. It's a 2 hour drive.\n\nMom called early in the morning and told me \"it's time. It's going to be in a few hours\".\n\nI hopped in the shower, cried, tried to find the right words I'd say to him. \n\nWe arrived in room 421 a mere 10 minutes after he took his last breath.\n\n\\--\n\nToday, I'm feeling better. More confident. \n\nBut I miss him. And I'm sure he would be so proud of the man I am today, even more than before.", "subreddit": "GriefSupport"}

My first dads anniversary of his passing is tomorrow, gone from his physical form for 22 years, and the pain still resides within me, just more distant even though I do see it come up very often these days. \n\nWe all know, myself more than many, that life is fleeting and unexpected but I forget that truth a lot. I forget that most things don\u2019t really matter and let them get to my head more than I\u2019d like to admit.

Our journeys are two-fold; there\u2019s one we do by ourselves and one that we take others along for the ride.\n* Take things one day at a time: there\u2019s no need to carry things that are heavy with you all the time.\n* Everything does happen for a reason, even if we can\u2019t see it immediately. \n* Try to see the light among the darkness. It might be really hard but I promise if you open your eyes enough, there\u2019s some light there. \n* Be grateful for each moment you have, because you don\u2019t know how many more you will get. \n* Be kind to yourself, and be kind to others - you don\u2019t know what someone else is going through. \n* If you can, help someone in need (but you must help yourself first.\n* Forgive. Forgive yourself, forgive others. There\u2019s nothing worth holding onto because in the end, it doesn\u2019t matter. \n* Death doesn\u2019t end a relationship, it\u2019s just a transition to a new journey. \n* Love is the best thing we will ever do.

I try to remember him that way. \n\nMy dad passed away from a Glioblastoma 1/19/19. He was diagnosed 6/25/18. He went through oral chemo and radiation. He lost his ability to walk. He tried so hard to work with physical therapy to be able to walk me down the aisle on my wedding day. He was never able to regain his strength and coordination. However, he was able to be wheeled down the aisle at my side by one of my brothers. I\u2019ve never seen him so happy in my life. After my wedding his health took a turn for the worse. He was completely dependent of care now. I recently moved 12 hours away and decided I was going to move back to help my brothers take care of him so he could remain at home as he wished. He wanted to do one more round of chemo, a battle I knew I would lose. I didn\u2019t want him to have side effects from the chemo. But looking back I\u2019m happy he tried once more. He told my aunt and I he \u201cdidn\u2019t want to go out without a fight\u201d. He was a true warrior, and he held on. \n\nWe were lucky enough to enjoy one more Thanksgiving and Christmas with him. I truly believe it was his gift to us. I returned home with my husband right before New Years. As I said goodbye to my dad, he thanked me for everything I had done. As I lay there with my head on his chest I tried not to think this was the last time I would talk to him. It really seemed like he was in a good place. My brothers called me a week later to tell me that he was doing worse and we decided to call hospice. Three days later I flew back home to be with him as he was actively dying. I was the one medicating him with morphine, every hour to lower his respiratory rate. I am a nurse and have cared for many dying patients. But seeing the man who I always considered to be my hero, mentor, and biggest support lay unresponsive in bed where a couple weeks prior he was joking and laughing with me breaks my heart. I knew he could still hear me and told him I was there with him, that my brothers were there, and that we loved him and it was okay to let go.

Needless to say, I hate Spring. \n\nA little back story: mom was my lighthouse in our toxic and abusive family. When she died, it was as if my whole world shattered. Ultimately, I cut my branch off the family tree and planted it by itself. Breaking ties with the rest of my family was easily the best decision I made for myself and my mental health. \n\nAfter her death, I got married and had a wonderful little boy who I wish she had gotten to meet. My husband, son, and in-laws became my family. My only family. They are wonderful, caring people who took me in and gave me the support and space I needed to grieve and recover. I will forever be grateful for that. \n\nEarlier this year, I asked my husband for a divorce. We still love and care for each other but it\u2019s just time to let go. The friendship was successful but the marriage was not. We are processing the divorce as well as can be hoped for but his family is not taking it well, especially his dad. I know they still love me but something, understandably, has been lost with the divorce. \n\nThe reason I bring this up is because this is the first time I have been completely with out family support my whole life.

I had a lovely Mother\u2019s Day with my son but once his dad picked him up and I was alone, the weight of my loneliness really set in. All week, my grief and depression have taken over and I have barely been functional. I have been eating and taking care of basic needs but I haven\u2019t been able to talk to anyone or go to work. I cry all the time and just lay in bed. \n\nGrief ebbs and flows, so I know I just need to ride it out. I know I\u2019m ok.

My dad was hospitalized about 60 days ago he had a hemorrhagic stroke, almost 2 weeks in the ICU and then rehab. I stayed back home for about a month since I live across the country. I did everything I can in my power to comfort him and be there for him. I tried my best to persuade him to move out of NYC and live with me in sunny and retirement friendly Vegas...but nothing worked. I am disappointed because after I flew back home my half siblings did not take him for a followup appointment with the neurologist...because you know a stroke is a neurological issue...and when I spoke to the doctor when we was in the ICU and they pretty much said they were trying to figure out if the stroke affected the frontal lobe of the brain that affects emotions....till this day I don't know.\n\nAfter rehab, he got out but went back again to the hospital about 2 weeks ago. He was under observation and was sent back to rehab again. He's not himself anymore, he used to be positive and cheerful but ever since the stroke left him wheelchair bound he hasn't been same since losing his independence. From what my friend has told me, my dad is going through his own grieving process. It was kinda hard to see other people in his situation or other people that are way worse off wanting to be able to go downstairs at the activity room in the rehab center or outside.  He's losing the will to live no matter how many times I try to sugarcoat hope in this situation. Its no longer a matter if but when because of the mountain of health issues pertaining to his heart and genetic issues that is going against his recovery on top of him being diagnosed with major depression. No matter what I say I do not have any power over this situation at all and to make matters worse my family situation is super complicated to the point  where I don't want to be associated with them even when I do reach out to them its just super vague answers.\n\nLiving with the anticipatory grief makes me already feel like I am going through the grieving process already, like any day now I am gonna get that very same phone call that I have to get the next flight out. I tried to have closure with him before I left and told my dad that no matter what happens I will be okay.\n\nI've been feeling so empty and withdrawn from all the happy people around me, I just can't force pretending to be happy anymore and pretend that everything is gonna be okay when its not. I am mentally exhausted now that the tears aren't coming out, its just that heavy feeling of sadness and emptiness that the inevitable is going to happen.  My work is being affected because I have a big mental fog right now that I just can't snap out of it. Even when I try to distract myself I just feel numb and empty. I thought I accepted things for what it is that he declined again after getting out to hospital to live with my half siblings and then he went back to the hospital again 2 weeks ago....My husband and I knew that was gonna happen and I am afraid about the same fate again once he gets out of rehab again.\n\nA year ago my dad and I had this conversation about his final wishes and I am living with the guilt every since day this is not what he wants. I was already distraught and grieving since then....\n\nSo that's why I am going home memorial weekend to see what's going on with him 5 hour flight back to go back home. I am not sure what else can I do being 2000 miles away aside from sending cards and talking to him for a few minutes when my mom aka his ex wife visits him. \n\nI saw a lot of suffering and pain in his face with him being in the ICU. That's why I already feel like I am going through the grieving process. \n\nWhat am I supposed to do in this situation? Am I going through what is normal with the anticipatory grief?", "subreddit": "GriefSupport"}

Its difficult to try and protect yourself from abuse and discomfort while also realizing that you risk loosing the chance for a change when that person passes on.

I still have both of my parents and my two brothers. Everyone is healthy, there are no family drama. I haven\u2019t lost any close friend in my entire life. I think sometimes that I have a little angel watching on me. But the longer I felt spared, the most I feared the tragedy of loss coming to me. I know it might sound stupid but I feel like I might not be prepared for loss. \n\nPeople around me often told me I could overcome any hard times as they see me as a strong person as I used to never show how affected I am. I just really think that I had been spared by life.\n\nI made of list of things I lost since last summer. Some might look trivial but if they are on this list they all had an impact on my mental:\n\n* September 2018: lost my first cat while on vacation. He left from where he was petsitted. Never heard of it since. (I must precise that I really, really am a cat lover, I can\u2019t picture to live without one)\n* November 2018: lost my love. My girlfriend of 5 years left me. I won\u2019t go about the explanations here but I took it really hard. It felt like the darkest time of my life. (and I can't thank r/breakups enough)\n* December 2018: lost my car due to lack of maintenance (my fault). Blamed myself and it caused some financial stress. I was kind of numb by the breakup at that time so I can\u2019t tell I was really sad because of it.\n* Early 2019: lost my main loved activity (not my job): my music band. I always considered them as family (I have been doing this for 10+ years). I know I can find a way to recreate something around music and I still do but it feel like another pillar of my life gone.\n* May 2019: lost my second cat a few days ago. He was kind of my best friend when I was in the dark time of the breakup. I can\u2019t tell how much I love him. It\u2019s only been a few days he is gone but I already lost hope of seeing him again. Let me explain: I live in a small village, everyone know my cat and everyone love him, he is very friendly and very affectionate with everyone. Everyone love cats except this one person who my neighbours heard saying he would get rid of all the cat in the village. (A second one have been missing since a few days). I haven\u2019t lived here for long so I don\u2019t know him at all (we came here with my girlfriend for peace and tranquility a year ago). \n\nThis particular last loss hit me pretty bad right now. I know you can lose a cat to the road, to the disease, or even to the wilderness but I can\u2019t begin to understand how one people living 50m from me would kill my best friend. As an introvert I always liked being alone but right now I really fear loneliness and I even fear living close to such people. \n\nI decided to move out of the house. I feel that I need a fresh start but I fear that I will lost something else or that I somehow brought all this on myself or maybe I could have seen it coming.

I loved her so much. She was a great lady, worked in public health, was basically a single mother. She was diagnosed 2 years before she died and a year before she died she found out that it was something that couldn\u2019t be beat.  She kept all this a secret from her family (besides our dad who told his friends and random people we barely knew). She continued to work up until about a month before she died. She never gave anyone any reason to be worried about her, she always was positive, she always listened to me and was always genuinely interested in what was going on in my life. I didn\u2019t appreciate her enough when she was alive because she put up with our dad who hurt us all so much but I\u2019ve come to understand that it wasn\u2019t wrong to be mad at the adults in our family for knowing how our dad was and essentially doing nothing to stop it.\n\nMy dad has a bunch of mental health issues in conjunction with an extremely fucked up child hood. which led him to have a drinking problem and be emotionally abusive. He left to go drill oil when I was in fourth grade so I only saw him for a few weeks every couple of months. During that time he cheated on my mom a lot. I saw him kiss a woman in front of me and my mom. My mom during that time had a friend that was a guy (I doubt she was cheating on him) but after days of him screaming at her in \u201cprivate\u201d we had a family meeting (me, my little sister, mom, dad) in which he basically just screamed at mom in front of us. I have a lot of really weird almost surreal memories from that period of my life. When he came back from oil drilling and got a job in our city  it was worse, like walking on eggshells constantly unsure what was gonna make him freak out. Senior year things really started to click for me, I came to understand how fucking bad all the stuff he did was. Ever since then he would freak out on me and I would leave home and stay somewhere else for a couple weeks. This cycle was happening while my mom was sick too, I was avoiding him at all costs up until a few months before my mom went into palliative care. \n\nWhile my mom was in Palliative care he was still a dirtbag, our drinking at the bars leaving me and my little sister to administer her medication. He got a girlfriend or was seeing other women while my mom was in palliative care and then started bringing them around a few Months after she died. My little sister was still living at home and it was a terrible time for her. She would have no idea where he was most of the time he would show up randomly drunk and yell at her to clean. She asked him several times not to bring his girlfriends around but he did. Then about 3 months ago we found out he was stealing my sister\u2019s social security money and when we asked him simple questions about it he freaked out about it and accused us of various things. My sister lives with me and my wife now. I haven\u2019t seen or talked to my dad since February. He pays my phone bill and he texted me randomly on the 23rd saying he wasn\u2019t paying for my phone bill anymore and I just fucking laid into him with a list of all this stuff he\u2019s done to me and his family so I think he blocked me but my phone is still on. \n\nIt\u2019s been a real hard time, I\u2019m glad my sister lives with me now. I get really sad randomly (like right now), I get really paranoid when my wife or sister have health problems because I\u2019m afraid they might actually be seriously ill (my mom initially had a bacterial infection in her colon), when my wife goes to see her doctor on the reservation (she is native so gets free healthcare) I make her text me updates about her drive because I\u2019m always paranoid she will wreck and die. When my wife wakes up and is walking to the bathroom or getting ready I get almost like flashbacks to my mom when she was sick. She just looked so tired all the time and hobbled around a lot (kinda like you do when you are really tired). I am worried that I am a marked person now, destined to have tragedy stalk me through life. Despite all this I think I\u2019m doing good sometimes like now I get like acute debilitating sadness and I just lay in bed for awhile. \n\nTL;DR : My mom died 7 months from cancer, we had a complicated relationship because of my dad who is an abusive alcoholic. My sister lives with me and I think we are doing ok now.", "subreddit": "GriefSupport"}

No one understands, and I have no idea how to continue living. She\u2019s just gone. It\u2019s so unfair to her that we\u2019re still here and she isn\u2019t. Every single breath that enters my body furthers this injustice. She didn\u2019t do anything to deserve her death. She was always so kind and good, but had such a hard and sad life. And then she left too early with a painful, painful death. I still can\u2019t even bring myself to say the word. She came into existence, lived a pretty sad life, and then went out of it in one of the most painful ways imaginable. So, from the bottom of my heart, and with all due respect, fuck anyone inexperienced with real grief and sorrow who spews \u201coptimism\u201d and \u201cpositivity\u201d bullshit. Fuck you. Every ounce of hope and positivity that exists your mouth is a direct insult to the irreconcilably terrible lives that some people have. It\u2019s great that your life is easy, and even easier to preach \u201cglass half full\u201d bullshit when your greatest struggles are caused by self inflicted boredom and dissatisfaction in things. But there are people whose lives embody the starkly grave and intense capacities of human suffering, and people seem all too eager to overlook them when generalizing to the overall value and goodness of human life. Like, no. Shit sucks, and if it has the capacity to suck so much for some people, then the entire endeavor is fucked up, even if the quantity of serious sufferers is, for the most part, less. I\u2019m sorry if I\u2019m putting salt into the wounds of anyone, and also sorry if I come off as delegitimizing less intense forms of suffering (which I guess I am doing)... I just can\u2019t contain my anger.

At the end\n\n\nSo here it is, me (33F) and my boyfriend (32m) come from 2 different countries and live in a 3rd one. We met one year ago and immediately clicked. He came to live with me withing a few days and we moved together to a very nice flat in December. \n\n\nHe was very depressed, had medication and managed to stay stable smoking a lot of weed. He has a long story of seeing psychiatrists, trying a lot of treatments since his childhood. He thought about it like an experiment they did on him because he was a turbulent child and his mom put him in a mental facility, which he thought was unfair. If I get it right, she had a lot to deal with. \nAnyway, I don't know much about his past. Just that he was ok when smoking and had very hard days when he had no weed. \n\n\nYesterday was a dry day. He was down, slept all day and could barely wake up. It's not unusual but I' m extra careful with him these days, trying to make things look better than usual. \nWe started a movie, but I didn't like it, we laughed, he even talked with some friends from his country about funny stuffs. He was ok. He hugged me, told me nice things, we said each other I love you and I went to bed. Nothing unusual. \n\n\nI found him hanged in the bathroom in the morning. I screamed, untangled him, slapped him, he was cold. The rest of the story is police coming, etc. \n\n\nI have few friends here, but they came through. Spent the day with me, took care of me awesomely. I'm ok with it, he was talking a lot about suicide, but I didn't expect him to do it for real, now that we were so happy. Not one fight in a year, we were independent and also very close. Supportive with each other, but never putting the weight of mental state on the other. He was incredibly patient and lovely. Everybody loves him. But still I'm not surprised really. I'm not angry at him and I don't feel guilty. I know it had nothing to do with us, he was sick and at a point he couldn't stand it I guess. \n\n\nMy question is, how do I cope? I have a lot of love and support, but I can't be with ppl all the time. I can't stay alone, I'm terrified. And I usually enjoy A LOT being alone with myself. Family and close friends are far, but their help through messages is awesome. Therapy is complicated because I don't speak the language here, and even in English it would be tough to find the words to communicate about such deep topic. And they give medicine like candy and I don't want that, I saw the effect it can have on someone fragile. Do you have tips that could help with the coming days?

I watched her strength diminish and her ability to walk vanish, being left in her hospital bed we had at home.

He killed himself a week or so ago from said problems. Even though they broke up, I continued to talk to him every month or two. I would just check in with him, ask him how he's doing or make a joke to him. The last thing we ever talked about, was him telling me to keep alcohol under control, because it just isn't worth it in any way.

When they first told me on the phone, I asked what happened and they vaguely told me her heart stopped beating. I had to wait four days before I could come back home and I thought I would just ask them what exactly had happened then because I wasn't able to go through a conversation on the phone without crying uncontrolably anyways.\n\nWhen I got home, my mom talked to me about how my sister had a really rough year and how it probably weakened her too much until she couldn't take it anymore. She specifically told me that they were worried that my sister had something to hide because they couldn't find her phone at first but they ended up finding it in a random place. My mom also told me about the fact that my sister was excited about going to vacation and adoptig a new pet. I thought by that she meant that she didn't commit suicide, I'm having trouble remembering exacty what she said rn but I'm 100% positive she was heavily implying that her body just gave up.\n\nThe thing is, today I had my mom's phone while she was driving and she told me to answer to my sister's boyfriend's text.  I did and since apparently I have no respect, I also read some previous texts from their convo. I thought it was very weird that they kept talking about suicide, her boyfriend seemed to be persuaded that my sister commited suicide while my mom was pretty elusive about it. I got worried so I checked her others texts to people, I wanted to see how she told them the news. So I found out my sister actually commited suicide by reading a text send to my family's doctor.\n\nI talked to my dad when I got home and he explained everything to me, apparently they were waiting for me to ask before telling me. I don't know what to do, I just feel like it just set my grieving process back to the start and I can't stop crying. This changes everything about how I approached the situation. I was finally able to keep myself from crying in public most of the time and I was hoping to make some more progresses until her burrial in two days so I could go through it without crying too much but I dont think I'll be able to anymore.\n\nI don't understand why they're lying by omission to almost everyone, including her closest friends, by implying her heart just stopped. I also hate that they made me complicit of their lie, one of her friends reached out to me and earlier today she asked me if I knew if she had any heart problems to begin with.

I got the call from my sister. A little backstory, Way back 70\u2019s or 80\u2019s according to my mother, the guy used to viscously abuse his ex wife (my grandmother.. deceased as well) and was a terror to live with. Crazy alcoholic, I\u2019m talking Russian roulette games on her for fun, urinating on her, really fucked up stuff. His violent and unpredictable behavior and the overall state of the household also led to my mother being molested by her brother (my uncle) he was 12 or 13, she was 7 or 8. \n\nFast forward a few years, my grandmother and my mother apparently jumped him, beat the shit out of him with cast iron skillets and made him leave, grandmother divorced him, etc etc. \n\nHe remarried and over the course of like 1980, to late 90\u2019s, went through a dramatic change, stopped drinking, went to church, really and truly transformed. I was born in 95, and I only have fond memories of him. He owned a door company, huge warehouse, very wealthy guy.. I remember being small, playing in the warehouse, going fishing, camping, beach trips with him, playing hockey, woodworking, awesome christmases. Everything. \n\nHowever, due to some animosity on my mothers side, these visits were few and far between when I was little. It wasn\u2019t until her mother died that she truly forgave her father and sought a relationship with him, and by that time, I was already 16 or so, and naturally I was too concerned with chasing girls or smoking pot or whatever, and had no interest in visiting him much anymore other than obligatory holidays and phone calls periodically. \n\nFast forward to earlier this year. I\u2019m 24, established, engaged, and doing well. I take my fianc\u00e9e to meet him, we spend a day together. It was really nice. We made plans to go fishing again, he hugged my fianc\u00e9e, said she was truly beautiful, told me I\u2019ve grown into a fine man. Really nice stuff. However, our plans for the summer are cut short. Two weeks later, he has a stroke. He never really came back from it, over the course of the last few months, he suffered another one, which pretty much turned him to a vegetable. The last time I saw him was on Mother\u2019s Day. He was completely immobile, bed ridden and mostly paralyzed. I held his hand, told him I love him. He told me he loved me, although, I could barely understand him. I left, pretty down about it, but glad I saw him.\n\nYesterday my mother told me I should come see him, as it wouldn\u2019t be long now, he had worsened, but I just started a new job coaching martial arts (my dream job) last week and I didn\u2019t want to mess anything up, so I declined. \n\nTonight, I got the call. He\u2019s gone. Passed in his sleep. I don\u2019t feel anything. I\u2019m angry at myself. I could have held his hand one last time. I could have felt him, warm. Maybe not talked to him, but at least felt his presence. He\u2019s gone now, and I don\u2019t feel anything. Is this normal? We weren\u2019t incredibly close, but we definitely loved each other. We never had one disagreement, we always were pals. Now he\u2019s dead. What the fuck? Why can\u2019t I feel anything? Am I fucked in the head? I\u2019m sorry this post is so long, My fianc\u00e9e is asleep, and I\u2019m wired, no one to talk to. \n\nAnyways, if this even gets any responses, thanks in advance for taking the time to read.", "subreddit": "GriefSupport"}

You were slowly walking around my bedroom looking at things, touching some things, then you looked at me and sat down beside me on the bed, just staring into space. You put your hand on my leg and I could feel it. When I woke up, I was still just numb. Lifelessly stumbled to the bathroom and just sat there. My leg was itchy and so I pulled up my leggings to scratch, and when I did, a dime fell out and onto the floor. Right where you\u2019d put your hand on me in my dream. When I had absolutely no coins left in my house after the day before. \n\nI\u2019ve felt you around me since then from time to time and usually it\u2019s on bad days, then I find dimes in strange places almost like it\u2019s you telling me to smile. \n\nI hadn\u2019t seen you in my dreams.

I could feel you when you hugged me, I could hear your voice and hear you laugh and it was like you were standing right next to me. I was so happy.. my heart was so happy. The dream repeated itself. It was weird, like almost when I play it back in my head it\u2019s like a recording and parts of the dream are weird, like my parents are sitting there talking to us like they suddenly care about the way I feel about you.

I ask him if i can do anything or if he wants me to support him in another way, he always says im a good support already. I'm making his favorite meals so he gets good calories when he's hungry.

He was a very healthy man, he would take our dog out for a walk almost every morning without fail after he fell in love with her. He loved walking too. At 72 he walked the alps with his friends who would travel all over to venture together. There really wasn't anything he couldn't do until he started getting ill a couple of years a go.\n He had a kidney failure that was so bad he should have died, but he was walking around as if nothing had happened until my grandma realised something was wrong. He had a catheter for a while and the doctors thought he might have had a stroke because his mental ability and eyesight began quickly declining from there on. As time passed the dementia got slowly worse and we found out he had prostate cancer that also spread to his bones. At his age there was only so much doctors could do, and eventually he mostly stopped treatment because getting him to hospital was too difficult. He then became bed bound and was being cared for by my mom and grandma.\nIn February of this year his health declined very quickly, so I took 2 weeks out of university to visit home. It completely broke me the first time I saw him laying there- I've never seen a person dying before and the last time I'd seen him he was sat up in bed, just very vaguely understanding what I was saying as we listened to \"what a beautiful world\". It was such a shock. He was also still experiencing pain in his legs from the bone cancer prior to being given proper pain relief, so often his eyes would widen in  pain and fear with his whole body shaking. You could tell from his expression that he was asking for help, but he couldn't speak. Once things had calmed we knew we would only have a few days left. We took it in turns to sit with his, holding his hand so he didn't feel alone.\nOne night i sat with him for a few hours, very quietly reading. Me and my mom realised how quiet his breath had become so gathered my sister into the room. Just as he took his last breath, my grandma managed to come in and tell him that it was okay to let go. It was painful but almost relieving in that we knew his suffering was over.\nWe held his funeral the week after and I travelled back to university the following day as there was so much to catch up on- but looking back I feel like I needed time to really grieve. One of the things I'm struggling with the most is that because he was ill for so long I'm finding it so hard to remember who my grandad was when he was well. I obviously have memories but they are so faded that it's hard to bring them back. I feel like I lost my connection with him when he forgot who I was, because sometimes he felt like a complete stranger when his dementia was bad. I feel really guilty as well that I've been away at university and couldn't spend more time with him over the past year- even though I know that's what he would have wanted.\nAs a counselling student I know that the grief doesn't really pass with time, you just feel the pain less frequently and learn to cope with that pain. It's just hard because I can't find that connection - the thing to really hold on to his memory.\nI had a dream about him not long a go and I like to think that it was him visiting me. We were happy and laughing in the dream and I think that's how he would have wanted to be remembered. As the man who lit up every room with his silly jokes and big BFG ears.\nI just wanted to share because it would be nice to hear from people who are or have been coping with grief after experiencing some form of anticipatory grief/the death of a loved one that was quite traumatic.", "subreddit": "GriefSupport"}

He was supposed to pick me up from work one night but didn't respond to my texts, so I ended up walking home. It was the night after we had this crazy snowstorm in Minnesota with a shit ton of snow and negative temps. Anyways I walked home and I found him laying facedown in the snow, dead. It was pretty gruesome, I suppose the cold temperatures didn't help either. Anyways that was horribly traumatizing, I didn't know how or why this happened. when the police came we went inside my home (we had been living together for the past two years) and they saw some kind of drugs on tin foil. I had never used drugs and I had never seen my late boyfriend use any either, before I met him he told me he used to use drugs (heroin) but he said he was sober for a year. And I belived him, throughout the relationship I never saw any drug use or signs. After the mortician looked at his body he found out that he had indeed been clean, (he could tell from his organs). So it's not like I could've prevented this from happening.  But for whatever reason he chose to try it again when I was away at work, and it had fetanyl in it and he died. And although I had given him rent money and he said he had paid it, it turns out he didn't and I had to leave my home within four days of his passing. I couldn't afford the bills on my own, so I had to leave behind my home my friends my job his family. To move back with my parents. (Side story) my parents were physically and mentally abusive really bad towards themselves and me when I was living there, that's part of the reason I moved out of home so early with my late boyfriend. And although there's no physical violence anymore it's still not an ideal situation. So that's stressful as well, and it seems I have no one to talk to about this. My friends leave me on read and cancel plans, I've been left on read from my boyfriends family members, even a girl who I knew whose boyfriend died asked me how I was doing, and when I replied was just left on read. I have a job interview on Wednesday so I'm hoping I'll make friends at work but it's so discouraging. I'm so freaking lonely, I feel ashamed to talk about my grief because people diminish it as his fault or less worthy of mourning as compared to a car accident or similar death. Like because he died that way I shouldn't talk about it is the vibe I'm getting from most everyone. Either they ignore me and brush it off with a yeah drugs are bad or with assuming he was a druggy the whole time ugh. Like you wouldn't say oh yeah shit happens to someone who's loved one died of cancer why be so insensitive to me??.  I had no doubt in my soul that I was going to marry him, he made me so happy and it truly was a perfect relationship. Respectful and caring in every way. I'm afraid no one will want anything to do with me now. like will people not want to become involved with me because of the stigma that's associated with the drug, will they think I knew and it's my fault, will a guy see me as too much emotional baggage because of my grief? I don't want to bother any of my few friends anymore (I've been left on read a couple times in a row now) so I'm asking strangers for guidance. Oh and I have severe depression and anxiety, it was nearly gone before the accident happened but now it's pretty bad. but I'm not like moody and sad all the time, I can be very happy and carefree when in public as to not be a buzzkill or worry friends, and I am happy most of the time now. It's just social rejection and pressure from others to move on is getting to me. I pray that things will get better but when your mind is clouded with grief and despair it's pretty hard to imagine a way to improve your life. So if anyone has any tips to become more social or anyways to help cope with these feelings it would be much appreciated. Thank you for your time.", "subreddit": "GriefSupport"}

He was shot MULTIPLE MULTIPLE MULTIPLE TIMES....by his \"friend\". It is still under investigation so I can't give many details. The story from the only witness keeps changing. My s.o. was unarmed, and shot in point blank range, until the investigation is over I won't be giving exact numbers, but he was shot several times, a large amount of gunshot wounds, the more the paramedics and doctors and nurses looked the more they found. He had no pulse by the time paramedics arrived..the man who murdered my life partner, our 4 year old sons \"superman\", is only facing 2nd degree murder charges. He stood next to his body until the police arrived. He took his life from him, from me, from our son, from his parents and sisters and other family..BECAUSE OF A CELLPHONE. The story has changed several times from the only witness ( 3 of them were \"friends\") but it is for sure it was over my s.o. cellphone. \n\nI was in complete denial the first week, by the time the hospital called me (he came in as an unidentified John doe) the medical examiner had already taken his body to the morgue. I had no idea until 4 hours after he was shot and died on the scene. He was 1 1/2 away, so 6 hours after he died I got to the hospital, for some reason they gave me no information over the phone about his condition. I was on the emergency contact list and had his permission in his paperwork on file to be able to call about records, appointments, etc.\n\nThey told me he was shot and killed. I asked where, their faces let me know it wasnt just \"where he was shot\" so I asked how many times, they were hesitant to give a number and just kept saying multiple times I cant remember much conversation between them but I remember one of them finally looking at the chart and the look on their face before the number was spoken was told me it was an insane #...then I was told and I dont remember anything else except for the only witness calling and asking if I could get his phone off his dead body, his phone, wallet, clothes, and jewelry had already been taken in as evidence. \n\nI was in denial truly and honestly believed it wasnt MY person they were talking about. I called his phone and the hospital and the morgue 100s and 100s of times. I was mad at him for not showing up I was mad at all these friends and family and people who kept telling me they were so sorry. I was mad that I was planning a funeral for someone I truly thought was no one we knew and mad at people for being so dramatic. I never showed my anger out loud, people knew though.  Our son was sitting with me when I got the phone call he knew something was wrong and I told him as soon as I was told. I read online, talked to several different funeral directors, and preachers, and people who have gone through what we were going through to get advice on what to tell our son, if he should or shouldn't go etc..after we had the conversation he took a day or so before he said anything and told me he wanted to help make sure daddy knows how much he was loved. He wanted to help with the arrangements and I made sure he understood and everyone else understood that HE is in charge of his comfort zone right now if he says no do not try to convince or push him anyway. No is no. He did very well, when he had enough he simply said okay mama I'm done and that was it. I prepared him but didnt prepare myself for it to really be him\n\n I thought the funeral (Sunday may 19th) would help. I opened the door  and could see his hat and forehead and couldn't breath I closed the door to the church and went outside to gather myself and still was like he is not the only person with that fucking hat how rude of them to put one on this guy so i walked inside and when i was able to see his face and his hands and him I couldn't breathe  I couldn't stand up I think I screamed not like scared kinda scream but like holy fuck my heart is being ripped out kinda scream and all I could say is fuck and then I got light headed and threw up from the pain there was literal pain all over my body. When I made it up to the casket my heart was in pieces I was shaking so much I fixed his eyebrows he woulda killed me if I didnt and I stood there for 2 hours not crying just standing and holding his hand trying to make sure I remembered every detail about him. And i cried when they told me i needed to let his hand go that they needed to close the casket it was time to take him to the cemetery. I watched our son help lower his casket into the plot I bought that wasnt for a stranger. And I went numb after that. I haven't felt shit.\n\nI cant sleep on a normal schedule or more than a few hours, I cant eat. And I cant cry..my brain knows I'm sad and knows im angry. I cant handle a lot of people around me or a lot of talking or anything really.

We wanted more babies, we were in love, he was my best friend, my support, my go to, my number one fan, my encourager, my other half, the father to our son.

I can go into unpacking that if anyone has questions but I\u2019m posting here for support. I feel like her death is the icing on the shit show cake for my life. She committed suicide, no one has been officially told but the funeral was today and there was no casket or any viewing of any kind. At the alter was a table with her picture, an Xbox controller, collectible figure and a few other items. The funeral is one of the many things that hurts me and the rest of us who knew who \u201cJared\u201d really was. Jared, as I mentioned before came out as transgender in high school after we dated. That\u2019s when \u201cJared\u201d became Jocelyn and she made it clear he was now she. She was only out to people close to her but I know she eventually wanted to fully transition. After high school life got to Jocelyn and she was struggling with mental illness and in school. I know at some point she also went to a psych hospital to get help, and was doing better we thought. We weren\u2019t as close as we used to be but when I started working at the mall in our hometown, I ran into her also working at the mall. We\u2019d talk whenever I\u2019d go on break but I kept my distance because I knew she had a bit of a drug problem. Not addiction but I knew she could get really irresponsible when it came to dangerous drugs. I\u2019m upset at myself because the last time we talked i didn\u2019t think to ask if she was doing okay and needed anything. I know her parents weren\u2019t very accepting of her being transgender. So much that at her funeral, Jocelyn didn\u2019t exist. The funeral service was held in a chapel. Led by a preacher, and gospels were played. I understand that there are traditions and customs but not much of the funeral really reflected who We really lost. Her best friend spoke but stayed clear of mentioning anything too personal out of respect for the family but her parents did not speak. Her sister cried the entire funeral, and not just tears, she had two people helping her walk she was so devastated. The songs that were played were country gospels, even though Jocelyn was openly against Christianity and organized religion.

My aunt is my sun and moon. I stupidly thought she\u2019d be the last to go and I would have her to help me navigate the death of one or both of my parents. She told me today that her cancer is back and she chooses not to fight it this time (round three). I respect her decision, but  my brain broke. I had a plan. I had an approach arranged. My plan? She\u2019d be there for me as my parents fell apart. I got complacent. I\u2019ve been so busy grieving my dad I forgot to spend good time with my aunt. Now she\u2019s going to go, my dad is almost gone. My mom is remains. I love her, but she is by far my most complicated relationship I have. I played it all wrong. I laid bets on who would go when, I set myself up for a plan that isn\u2019t going to happen. It all just hurts. \n\nThe boyfriend responded to all this with \u201cI may be dying too, like your aunt, everyone is.\u201d I just wanted to scream at him. We currently aren\u2019t talking because he couldn\u2019t agree to disagree. I thought he what he said was insensitive, but I didn\u2019t ask for an apology and I let it go. But he couldn\u2019t accept the fact that I found it kinda abrasive, what he said. We\u2019d almost reached a truce and then I stupidly said I was sad we hadn\u2019t spend more time with my aunt. He took that as criticism (again making it about himself) and stomped off, firmly on the moral high ground. So my whole world is on fire. And the one guy I have as support is kinda a jerk. I\u2019d never treat his grief like that. I know because our roles have been reversed. I believe in listening to the grieving. So now I\u2019ll have no one. \n\nMy mom will likely outlive my aunt and dad and my relationship. I won\u2019t have a \u201cnormal\u201d life for another decade. I\u2019ll be tangled up in wondering why I didn\u2019t do xyz with my aunt, dad, mom. I\u2019ll be forever second guessing myself. I\u2019ll be forever missing them. I moved states thinking they\u2019d all be gone in six months after I got here. That\u2019s why I moved. I\u2019ve been a care taker for three years, with a small life. Keeping it small and still didn\u2019t spend time with the one who will go first. I got complacent. But I\u2019ve also realized I stopped living because I\u2019ve been bracing for their deaths. Now it will begin. And it won\u2019t play out at all as I thought.  So now I have no life, haven\u2019t lived for years, and I\u2019ll still have to lose all of them. The one tiny investment I\u2019ve made in something like a future is the boyfriend, but I don\u2019t have hope there. He doesn\u2019t see a future for us. Why should I quarrel? I have no one.

Once while I was scrying trying to talk to you, you told me \u201cbreathe deep and hesitate\u201d while I was on about my sister, I wish I\u2019d had listened to you, because it was good advice.\n\nI\u2019ve missed you every day, but it\u2019s been getting easier to miss you. When I tell dark jokes about my dead mom, it\u2019s not underlined with pain, it\u2019s not followed by tears, because I know that you\u2019re laughing at it with me.\n\nToday I made my fianc\u00e9 listen to trapped in the closet by r kelly (not monetized cause he\u2019s a bad bloke) and roses by OutKast. He hates your taste in music, and I\u2019m sure you\u2019d have liked to torture him just as much as I do. Oh yeah, I\u2019m engaged, but I\u2019ve said that already in a lot of prayers.\n\nI wish you\u2019d have let yourself live long enough to see me in a wedding dress.\n\nI know you were hurting, I know you were suffering, but it was so selfish of you to take those pills. You turned your suffering into suffering for the rest of your family and that\u2019s not fucking fair mom. I love you and that\u2019s why I took care of you but I\u2019m not going to glorify your struggle or your decision. It is what it is, and you took yourself away from your family, and I hope someday I can forgive you for it, but I know I can\u2019t yet.\n\nI love you, I miss you, I\u2019m still thinking about you, but I\u2019m not kissing a dead woman\u2019s ass anymore, and I think that\u2019s okay.

I lashed out at someone because they hurt me and their response after I told them I was in a bad place was....  \"I know that's why I am still here\" they went on to say how I hurt them after they hurt me... I know 2 wrongs don't make a right.... and they basically came back because they felt sorry for me and felt like I needed them. I don't want pity. I want someone who says they will be there actually be there. I am so tired of the pity looks and empty promises. How do you all cope with that?

One of my friends took his own life at the end of April.  It was our first year of college, and i don\u2019t want to get too specific on details because of privacy, but he had transferred out around March to go back home (states away) to get a job.  I was so sad the morning he told me he was leaving I was just bawling and he had asked me \u201cwhy are you crying?\u201d And I said \u201cbecause I\u2019m going to miss you\u201d I was going to go to class (ended up not going because I couldn\u2019t stop crying) so I was trying to stop crying. He explained why he was leaving and all that but I felt like I couldn\u2019t even say anything without crying so I just gave him one last hug before I had to leave for breakfast.  I had no idea that would be the last time I saw him in person.  A few days before he took his own life I had texted him to see how he was doing and he told me everything was good.  I told him how my friends and I missed him here but he didn\u2019t really seem to acknowledge it so I had thought he just didn\u2019t want to be reminded.  I felt relieved when he said he was doing good because I had always comforted myself with the thought \u201che\u2019s not dead he\u2019s not sick he\u2019s just going back to get a job\u201d. But now he really is dead :(. 3 days later I got a call from my friend saying that he had killed himself and there was no note or anything. His family thought we would have the answers but we thought they would.  It was so surreal to me and strange being at the wake because it was like everyone there was connected by him but it was all just one big question mark.  My friends and I met his family and they were so amazingly kind just like he was.  Idk I thought I was doing better but I haven\u2019t been able to stop thinking about him even though, thankfully, I was able to say my goodbyes at the wake and funeral.  I think the biggest part that messes with me is that he had future plans, he was so excited to come visit my friends and I this summer, and most suicidal people don\u2019t talk about future plans.  And i know it\u2019s not my fault but I still wonder like \u201cwhat if I had just kept that conversation going for a few more days?\u201d \u201cwhat if I had sat down and called him on the phone to see if he was actually good like he said was\u201d? He was genuinely one of the nicest people I\u2019ve ever met in my life.  He NEVER had a problem with anyone, never spoke bad about anyone, LOVED his family and friends, super humble and kind to anyone he met.  At the wake, his lovely mother had asked his friends and I what was our favorite and least favorite thing about him and I genuinely could not even think of something I disliked about him.  And now he\u2019s just gone and I still find myself crying wondering about him.  Some of my other friends who were close to him don\u2019t seem as emotional about it anymore so I guess I\u2019ve had trouble getting these feelings out to people who understand. And by the way, I luckily do have a therapist who I love and I talked to her about it.  This experience has made me so much more aware of how I treat people and in his honor I try to treat everyone with the upmost kindness that he radiated while he was here.

His age, coupled with his grief, have made him irritable, stressed out and depressed.\n\nMy mom has been in the process of downsizing from our family home and things have really been changing for Nigel. This hasn\u2019t been easy on any of us, but for fur babies it\u2019s especially hard because there is no way to explain what\u2019s happening to them. \n\nWe had to take Nigel in to the vet for a bout of intestinal distress that he has been experiencing. He is a large dog, and absolutely hates car rides so it is very difficult taking him anywhere without medication. We got to the vet and had him examined without issues, but when it was time to take him home he started having severe breathing difficulties in the back of the car. It went from normal bulldog panting (if any of you are familiar - bulldogs are notorious for breathing issues due to their short snouts) to full-on gasping for air in a matter of minutes. We rushed him to the nearest pet hospital and they were able to get him intubated before it was too late, but the damage to his airway from the trauma of his labored breathing was already extensive. The emergency vet gave us a list of options, but let us know that at this late stage of collapse in the lower airway, this would be a salvage operation. \n\nWe only had a few hours to make a decision, and unfortunately we made the tough call to put him to sleep. It all happened so fast, and I\u2019m absolutely heartbroken. My mom and I were able to be by his side and love on him through the final minutes of his life.

I wanted nothing than to make him as happy as we could after my dad died, but instead we made the end of his life scary and painful. I was hopeful for more time with him. He was more than an animal to me, he was my brother. I hope he knew how much we loved him.", "subreddit": "GriefSupport"}

I'm really, really struggling.", "author": "expectinggarbanzo", "self_text": "All of my life I've known that I have a sister in Heaven. We always had a picture of her hung somewhere in the home - she looks out from the image with brown eyes as deep as the ocean, curly brown hair tucked under a white hat, hands held politely in front of her, looking wise beyond her years. Her name was Shandra, and she was tiny for her age, that much I knew. In this picture she is around 2 years old. My mom would talk about her every so often, and my sisters and I would listen eagerly to stories about our big sister that was no longer there. As we got older we'd learn more about her. She died when she was 2 years and 8 months old from lymphoma. I always knew that it was a cancer that was extremely rare in small children that stole my sister from us. I always knew that my sister was sick most of her life and they struggled for a long time to find out what exactly was wrong, I always knew she went through so many MRI's, cat scans, etc. and that my mom blamed her cancer on that.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nGrowing up, the hole in our lives that Shandra left behind was normal. It took me a long time to realize that not every family has a monumental loss like this. The normalcy that I felt around the loss caused me to not ask as many questions as I now wish I would have. We lost my mom a year ago to pancreatic cancer. A few times I thought the grief would kill me. Over the last year, as I've reflected on my life and relationship with my mom and my regrets, I linger on the loss of my sister. I feel so much guilt for not talking about her with my mom more, for not asking more questions, for not hugging my mom and telling her I'm so sorry for what she went through.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis last weekend we had the difficult task of clearing out my mom's house to be sold. While going through her office, I found a grief journal she wrote in 2009. She recounted, in vivid detail, the life and death of my sister. Some things I knew, a lot of things I didn't. I'd like to recount Shandra's story for you all, mostly transcribed directly from my mom's grief journal (with some things reworded, and shifted to third-person perspective). I know it is long - a quick TLDR...Shandra was born tiny and frail, struggling to gain weight - undergoing dozens of scans throughout her short life to find the cause. At 2 and a half years old, she had lymphoma and little chance of surviving the cancer or the chemo. My parents tried the first round of chemo and Shandra nearly died. They decided against the next round, opting to take her home and pray for a miracle. CPS was granted emergency custody on grounds of 'medical neglect' due to this, and forced Shandra to get another dose of chemo, which ultimately killed her.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;My mom was 22 when she had Shandra in 1984. She was tiny, especially for a full-term baby, weighing only 4 pounds. For the first 3 months of her life she struggled to gain any weight. The doctors were baffled, and that was when they began all of the testing. MRI's, CAT scans, injecting her with dye and x-raying her, blood tests, and so on and so on. She was put on a feeding tube and every ounce of nourishment was measured - she was getting sufficient amounts that she should have been gaining weight. But she wasn't. The doctors thought that she may have a tumor, and that was where her calories was getting expended. They finally decided to open her up to see if there was a tumor - after the operation the doctor came out and said that her small intestine \"looked as if a bomb had gone off in it\". It was shredded to pieces, they didn't know what to make of it. They sent her case out for consultation, and a doctor in California responded that he had a similar case - the problem turned out to be a lack of enzymes in the intestine to break down food into a form that nutrients could be extracted. Because it wasn't broken down by the time it reached the intestine, the effect it had on her intestines was like acid. They tested Shandra and sure enough - she had no digestive enzymes. The doctor in California had been able to make a special formula for the other child by introducing synthetic enzymes into the formula so that the nourishment entered the child's body already in a form that could be utilized. By the time the California child had reached age 3 his body had begun to produce the enzymes normally. Years later my mom learned that such problems had become fairly common in babies, but at the time Shandra was diagnosed it was very, very rare.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;She had to be fed with a tube and could eat nothing by mouth - when she was about eleven months old they were finally able to take her home from the hospital. She was still tiny for her age - at a year old she weighed just over 12 pounds. It was a battle - gain two ounces, lose one, gain one, lose three - every ounce she gained and held onto was a victory. Until she was about 20 months she was constantly in and out of the hospital frequently, going through many, many CAT scans, MRI's, etc. to see how her intestine was healing and always to be watching for tumors - they kept thinking she must have a tumor as she struggled so hard to maintain weight, and they couldn't think of any other possibility that could be draining so many calories from her.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;When she was about 18 months, her intestine had healed enough so that she could begin to take food by mouth. However, without having done so she had no clue what to do with a bite of food. she would hold it in her cheek like a chipmunk and refuse to swallow. For one thing, her mouth muscles hadn't developed as she hadn't exercised them through eating by mouth since birth. A second problem was that she had a tube down her throat and it was uncomfortable to swallow. But until she could eat on her own, she also had to have the tube.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;It took about six months to overcome that problem. By the time she was two years old she was eating by mouth, she had begun to produce enzymes and they could slowly introduce different types of food. They were able to find enough foods that she could begin to digest and eventually were able to wean her off the tube.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;She was a normal two year old child for about six or seven months - playing, talking, dancing, laughing. It was the best time. She loved airplanes. She could hear an airplane outside long before anyone else noticed it and run to the window searching frantically until it came into view. She would point and excitedly exclaim, \"plane! plane!\" One of her favorite things to do was to go to the airport and watch planes take off and land. For some reason, she was fascinated by them.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;One day she was eating a cookie. she heard a plane and ran to the window and was craning her neck to look for the plane. With her neck stretched, she swallowed a bite of cookie and as she did so my mom noticed a lump on her throat. She felt it and it was small and hard, about the size of a pea. My mom called the pediatrician and took her in - he thought it was just an infected lymph node from a recent cold. He said it should go away in a few weeks. Over the next few weeks the lump grew quickly until it was very noticeable. At the same time she lost energy quickly, wanting to sleep more and more. After a couple more visits to the pediatrician, they decided to send her to the Children's Hospital.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Quite quickly they diagnosed her with non-Hodgkin's, non-lymphoblastic T-cell lymphoma. It wasn't good. The oncologist said that typically this kind of cancer was only seen in men, over age 50, in urban cities with significant radiation exposure. The doctor said that if she were given chemo in the recommended protocol (set for the typical patient - a 50+ year old male) it would likely kill her. Yet without chemo and radiation the cancer would kill her. Did they want to try the chemo? What a choice. They knew she would die without it - yet she was given 6+ months to live. If they opted for the chemo her chance of surviving was very slim and would likely hasten her death. They decided they had to try.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;The oncologist gave her the first dose. She nearly died - she had to be put on a respirator and barely survived. It was quite clear that she wasn't strong enough to survive the full protocol. They asked to take her home when she recovered enough. The doctors agreed - giving them enough medical equipment, medication for pain, etc. to take her home.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;As my mom was leaving the hospital the oncologist said \"I want to know that you know that she will die. You do know and accept that?\" My mom replies, \"no, I don't know that. I believe in God - I believe in miracles. I don't know that. You have all done everything you can do but I don't know that God as done everything He can. We are praying for a miracle.\"  \n&gt;  \n&gt;They were home for about three days - it was the middle of December. One night, there was a terrific cold front and it was snowing. My mom was on the sofa holding Shandra while she played with a toy airplane. There was a knock at the door and my dad opened it. Three police officers and some CPS workers came into the house stating they had a court order to remove Shandra from my parent's care for medical neglect. Medical neglect? The child had spent more of her life in hospitals than out - she had been under medical care every day of her life. My mom said, \"you are mistaken, what are you talking about? Call her pediatrician right now. He will tell you there has never been medical neglect or any other kind of neglect.\" The CPS worker ignored my mom's pleas and began to unplug Shandra's machines and ordered the cops to start carrying them out to the squad car. One of the officers intervened - told her \"I think you made a mistake here\" and told her not to do anything until his sergeant arrived. The sergeant arrived and ended up calling Shandra's pediatrician. My mom could hear the pediatrician on the other end screaming \"I'm coming over - don't any of you do anything until I get there, don't touch that child.\" After a few minutes the officer handed the phone to my mom, and the pediatrician told her\" I'm 5 minutes away - she cannot go out in this weather, her health is too precarious.\"  \n&gt;  \n&gt;The CPS worker was livid, and my mom began pleading for answers and information, asking where they would take Shandra. She found out they planned to take her to a children's shelter for foster kids. My mom grew furious, saying \"she can't be around other children, even a cold could kill her. She can't go there.\" By this time, more cops and EMT's showed up and one of the EMT's said \"her condition is too precarious and she has too much medication and life-support machines to go anywhere except with someone trained to operate them.\" The CPS worker leaned over to the feeding pump and said, \"well? How do you work this?\" My mom was absolutely gobsmacked, she had to go through weeks of training to operate the machines.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;The pediatrician finally arrived and it was decided that Shandra would go to the hospital. Just the coming in and out and the cold air had started to cause her respiratory problems. She was admitted to the hospital and already had a collapsed lung. The pediatrician called a lawyer for my parents - he said there would be an emergency appeal the next morning. Apparently, what had happened was that the hospital had a legal department that reviewed all dismissals - namely those that were 'sent home to die'. If patients are sent home - and then die - it leaves the hospital vulnerable to families later suing and saying the hospital didn't do all that it could. It was legal protocol for the attending physician to elicit a statement from the individual or family stating they were aware that death was unavoidable. My mom hadn't given them the statement they'd wanted - so the hospital legal department's claim made to CPS was that 'with a chemo protocol survival rate of 60%' (not based upon Shandra specifically but based on the typical patient) and my mom's statement of 'praying for a miracle,' the claim was that they'd taken Shandra out of the hospital to pray for her rather than seek a medical solution.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;At the emergency appeal the next morning, no one was allowed to appear in the courtroom. They could not call witnesses or present evidence. The attorney could appear on my parent's behalf but could not call witnesses or present evidence to argue against CPS's findings. CPS had been contacted by the hospital, they took the claim as fact and asked for an emergency injunction to remove her that had been granted by the judge. My parent showed up to the courthouse that morning to try and appeal that judge's decision - but it was almost unprecedented to have something like this overturned. After about 45 minutes, the lawyer came out and said the judge had ruled that custody would remain with CPS and the court ordered her to return to Children's and resume chemotherapy. But that will kill her, my parents argued. But regardless that was the court order - the only concession he'd been able to get was the judge offered that my parents could take her back themselves rather than having CPS transport her. If my parents refused the offer - if they chose to fight the order - they'd be barred from contact with her and Shandra would likely die without them ever seeing her again.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;What kind of choice is that? My parents were absolutely devastated, but what choice did they have? They conceded and said they'd take her back themselves. They went home and got a few clothes and things for her - my mom recounts standing in the door as they were preparing to leave. Shandra's toy airplane was still on the sofa, she had been playing with it when everyone showed up. Her bib was hanging on the back of her high chair and a bowl of soup was still on the tray. My mom couldn't bear to move it to the sink and clean it. She didn't know when they'd be back but she knew it would be without Shandra and couldn't bear to wash that bowl. She couldn't bear the thought that it would be the last time she'd clean her high chair, that that was her last meal at home. She looked at it and had the most absurd argument with herself - 'you should wash it before you go' vs. 'I can't bear to wash it'. The unfathomable predicament they had been forced into - they couldn't fight the order without being barred from seeing her ever again, if they fought she would have to die without my mom there to hold her and comfort her. My mom must have stood in that door vexing over whether to wash the bowl for almost half an hour. She finally left it.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;They loaded Shandra into her car seat, hanging her feeding bag from the hook for clotheshangers, and headed toward the hospital. They pulled off the interstate at the next exit and thought about their options - they could run for Mexico. But they had no money, and how would they get pain medication for Shandra? Or nutrition for her feeding tube? And they'd already been told the State Patrol would be watching for them in case they tried to flee. They had no choice - they had to take her. They pulled off at the next exit and debated it all over again, and came to the same conclusion- they had no choice. They did that at every exit, always coming to the same conclusion. It took them almost seven hours to get to the hospital, a drive that normally took two and a half. They met up with her oncologist at the hospital, he was very distressed. My parents asked - I thought you said another dose would kill her? Why would they do this? The oncologist didn't say much.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;The next morning a doctor my parents didn't recognize came in and said it was time for her to go for chemo. They asked where the usual oncologist was, and he wouldn't say. The nurse later said the doctor had refused to give the chemo and said, \"I became a doctor to save children's lives, not kill them.' So the hospital had brought someone else to do it.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;They gave Shandra the chemo and she stopped breathing during the treatment. She was put on a ventilator and when my parents saw her in the ICU some hours later she was barely clinging to life. She had so many tubes running in and out of her body that they couldn't even hold her. Machines surrounded her - it was difficult to even get close to her. By late that day, the catheter tube began to turn pink, showing blood in her urine. By the next morning it was running completely red. They asked my mom's permission to remove the feeding tube. Then to remove the platelet and blood transfusions which were not keeping up with the blood she was losing. Finally on the third day they asked to remove the ventilator. My mom cried and pleaded 'no, no no. I can't bear to lose her. I can't let her go.' They said, 'we have to do it soon, but you tell us when you are ready.'  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Shandra was barely ever conscious - hazily opening her eyes and searching until she found mom. My mom prayed and prayed that she wouldn't die - thinking her heart would burst through her chest it hurt so much to think of losing Shandra. Every cell in her body ached at the thought. She describes the pain as all of your skin suddenly being gone and every nerve ending in your body exposed to air and cold. Once again, Shandra opened her eyes and this time she looked intently into a space above her. She looked at my mom and as if my mom could actually hear her speak - she said - I'm going now.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;My mom recounts the same look in Shandra's eyes weeks before. She was walking Shandra around the hospital in a little wagon painted like an ambulance. As mom was pulling the wagon, she looked back at Shandra. Shandra had that intent 'listening' look and my mom felt a presence so real. She knelt down beside Shandra, she couldn't speak and hadn't been able to for two months. A tube had to be put down quickly and it and damaged her throat. My mom heard that same plea then as she did now - ' please let me go, I need to go now. Please let me go. 'My mom sobbed and pleaded \"No, no, no, keep fighting baby - we will beat this, just don't give up\" Shandra sat back and dropped her eyes.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;This time, my mom went to her and said, \"I'll find you again. I'll never let you go in my heart, I will find you again and I won't forget you - I love you more than anything and more than I'll ever love anyone or anything again, please forgive me for letting this happen\". And she took Shandra's respirator off. Shandra closed her eyes and took one long breath in, and as she breathed out - her soul left her body.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI had no idea that my parents were forced to give Shandra that second dose of chemo. I always knew that there was an incident with CPS - and we learned a few years ago that my mom's aunt \"corroborated\" CPS' medical neglect claims (she was an evil witch). My mom never fully accepted the loss of Shandra, and my dad was not supportive of my mom's grief. My mom did all sorts of things to memorialize Shandra, including constructing 'Shandra's Playhouse', a playground outside the Children's Hospital where she died. We recently learned that it was unceremoniously demolished to make room for something new and shiny. This aspect of the story has absolutely devastated me and I just wish I could hug my mom and tell her how sorry I am that she had to lose her first baby like that.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy only solace is knowing that in some way, my mom and Shandra's souls are together again. I think my mom was taken away early from us because their souls could just not bear being apart anymore. I miss and love you both so, so, so much. Please give each other a big hug and kiss from me. I can't wait to see you again, mom and I can't wait to finally meet you, Shandra. My son has your eyes.", "subreddit": "GriefSupport"}

Anne. it was Anne. i don\u2019t remember what i said back to her but she made me give the phone back to my cousin, and i went into the tv room. the morning news was just starting. ill never forget what happened. there on the national news was a picture of Anne, and the headline read \u201cJogger Found Dead\u201d. so we stared at the tv, not saying anything, listening to a news anchor tell us our cousin and granddaughter was murdered.\nok, after this, i don\u2019t remember anything. i remember fainting in my room and being unconscious for 1 hour. i remember packing up my cousins car with my grandpas oxygen tank and i remember the drive back to new york feeling like it was 5 minutes long. one thing i know is the entire car ride i didnt believe it. i knew it wasnt Anne, she was always traveling or working or at school, she\u2019s probably there, in 5 minutes theyre gonna find her alive in France or Spain or at home and this is gonna all just be a small blunder.\nbut then we pulled up to my aunt and uncles block. and the entire thing was taped off and cop cars, squad vans, CSIs, and 100 different news outlets sat in front if the house. thats when i knew - there was no mistake. my cousin was murdered.\n\nim 18 now and starting college soon. the trial just ended for her killer, and he\u2019ll be spending the rest of his life in prison. but every day im still sad. im still not okay. when i let myself think about it i cry for hours. my family isn\u2019t necessarily broken now; we came together and are stronger as a family. but at the same time, Anne\u2019s parents cant be in the same room together. her sister is no longer the person she was. every family function it is glaringly and painfully obvious that we are missing someone. my family is forever incomplete. \nAnne was only 30 years old, and only 30 for less than a month before she was taken from us due to a random attack. i feel like at this point i should be okay. we weren\u2019t close we were 15 years apart. but i still cant get over it. \n\nwhat happened to your family when it happened? how did you guys get through it?\n\ni just want to be happy again.\n\nedit: i should also mention that i dont have friends at this point. when it first happened no one in my school would talk to me because they had no idea what to say. so no one talked to me about anything. my boyfriend is my only friend. when i say i have no friends i mean it. i dont snapchat anyone or talk to anyone in school, when my boyfriend is not around i just sit alone at home and either think about Anne or smoke weed. oh yeah, the trauma also pushed me into a marijuana addiction. i cant be sober and i cant be alone. i go to therapy and im on meds but thats all because i was depressed anyway before all of this.", "subreddit": "GriefSupport"}

Didn\u2019t clean my room to perfection? Whole closet\u2019s on the floor now. Consistently got compared to my biological father whom she hated with the passion flames of a thousand suns.

I'd like to share my story with people, because it's something I was ashamed of for most of my life. My mom passed away at the end of February and I wasn't in the country, I didn't get to see her or hold her hand, to say goodbye.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm a 26 year old female and I was recently living in Shenzhen, China and teaching abroad. I've spent the last three years teaching in Europe. I graduated university in 2015 and I went abroad immediately. I had intended to return to my city and do an M.Ed, but there was a job fair with positions abroad and I was drawn to that. I had spent five years away at school and I tried to maintain a comfortable distance between family and I. I was raised by a single parent, my mom never worked a day in my life. She was on social assistance and her days revolved around smoking cigarettes, watching TV, and eating. No one in my family had graduated high school, my oldest brother was very successful and owned our house, but I was the first in my family to go to university. I kind of feel like the black sheep of the family.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy mom had several cancer scares, which terrified my family as she had smoked for over 40 years. In my last year of undergrad she underwent a 6 hour surgery where they removed 20% of her right lung. Subsequently, she had the lung collapse and spent a lot of time in ICU. The following year she had surgery to remove her thyroid which was cancerous, but not related to the lung cancer (it hadn't spread, the thyroid cancer was localised) and her doctors were monitoring the other lung. All of this happened over the span of finishing my B.A, finishing my B.Ed and moving to Sweden for my first teaching job.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSweden was a tough year, I flew for the first time in my life. It was my first time leaving Canada. I felt lonely not having a support system at home, I was 22 and out in the world - paying back my student loans, travelling. I made some great friends, but the job sucked. Especially for someone right out of university and I just felt grateful to be away from my life in Canada. So, flash forward. I got a 2 year contract to teach in Italy, which felt like a smooth transition already living in Europe. Needless to say, life was not 'la dolce vita'. I struggled to connect with people because unlike my experience in Sweden, people were not receptive. The work environment had a very cliquey feel among the English staff and connecting with local Italians felt impossible without a knowledge of the language. I tried to learn Italian, but I had just moved to a new country. I was working out the paperwork and legal stuff (banking, work permit, etc.), I was teaching full time (adjusting to a new school, curriculum, etc.)  and I lived with a roommate who made me feel terrible. I relied on school provided housing because it seemed easiest, I hadn't made any Italian friends early on to help me find an alternative option. In retrospect, I was really young and helpless.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIn my first year of the contract, my mom had congestive heart failure. I got a call around Christmas saying that my mom had either had a stroke or a heart attack. I was gutted. I didn't fly home right away, because she had many occurrences of hospital stays and health issues. Not to diminish the fact, but living in another country I couldn't just drive home every time something happened. I had to wait (considering the time difference) and talk to my brothers (who, by the way are 20 years older than I am... I am 26 and they are respectively 44 and 46). My mom ending up pulling through, per usual. She maintained her lifestyle, though she had quit smoking after the lung surgery. She was morbidly obese, close to the point of immobility. She relied on my 'youngest' older brother to take care of her. Throughout all of her hospital stays, surgeries, treatments, and so on, she was mean to family, alienated friends, and was pretty terrible towards hospital staff and doctors and times.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIn the second year of my contract (September 2017) I got a call saying my nephew had a brain tumour. He was 17, closer in age than my brothers. I remember going to his doctor appointments when my sister in law was pregnant, he felt like my baby brother. He was a healthy guy, played hockey, went for a routine eye appointment and it turned out he had a massive brain tumour pressing on his optic nerve. Within 24 hours we were told he was dying because his brain was swelling. This was a Friday, so I flew out and arrived Sunday. On Monday he had an 11 hour brain surgery. His recovery has been miraculous, because he has his sight, his memory, proper function. Nonetheless, it was devastating. He turned 18 in the hospital. One day I was rubbing oil in his remaining hair (they had shaved half of his head as the incision was from ear to ear across the top of his head) and he said he wanted me to move home. He said all he had ever wanted for me was to be home. For myself, someone who hadn't felt much self worth, I was gutted. I spent one week in Canada and I flew back to Italy, right back to work.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNone of my coworkers reached out. I had swapped roommates with coworkers, living with my 'best friend' at the time who was diagnosed with bi-polar disorder. So, lots of ups and downs. I was already struggling with my mental health, my mom was ill and now my nephew was sick. That experienced wasn't validated, some Italian coworkers didn't even know I had left the country. The English staff while aware, weren't really supportive. No one asked me to grab a coffee, or if I ever needed to chat. I felt like absolutely, 100% transparent. And that's a really bad feeling. I felt like people saw right through me, like I didn't matter. My job was tough, the living situation was worsening. By mid October I was close to a breakdown. The new director at the school had offered me an out from the two year position. I could leave at Christmas in good standing and return to Canada.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTo avoid further rambling, I met my current boyfriend 1-2 weeks after giving my resignation. Again, absolutely gutted. I had no plan in Canada, little savings. I left the one person I had really loved and connected with (especially in such a short time). I had dated one Italian guy for 8 months or so prior, being accused of being 'mysterious' (never quite 'secretive' but I had the feeling he wasn't happy with had closed off I was). I was terrified to let myself be seen, to say that living in Italy wasn't wonderful and filled with expats, food, travel, learning a new language, etc. It was all of those things and it wasn't, it felt like something it should have been. When I returned to Canada in January, my Airbnb fell through because the furnace blew. I squatted with my best friend at her home, dodging my family as a whole and limiting my interactions with my mom.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy January - June consisted of daily radiation appointments for my nephew (who was staying with my mom in the city for treatments) and hospital appointments for my mom. While working a crappy minimum wage job, not related to teaching at all. One of my last big memories of my mom and I is a hospital trip which I had to push her wheel chair and her oxygen tank to the bathroom. I lifted her on to the toilet (by this time she was around 400 pounds) and I wiped her. This was something I never wanted to do, it wasn't a complication of the heart failure or the cancer, it was a result of her obesity. A lot of her health was circumstantial, due to lifestyle.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAt the time I had applied for the original M.Ed again, I got in (again) to the same fully funded program. I was scared of staying in the city, in Canada in general. My life felt empty and hopeless, somehow even more so than it did while living abroad. I found a job with a Canadian school board in China and I left for Shenzhen at the end of August. My nephew's radiation finished (the tumour was non-cancerous, a benign growth - with no history of the condition in our family by the way, this is still something pretty shocking to us) and the remaining tumour was considered inactive. My mom's health had stabilised, she understood my decision to go to China and supported me in the end. For someone who was as sick as she was and for so long, I felt like I couldn't wait here any longer and wait for something to worsen. It was like a rollercoaster, up and down and so often. Every single hospital stay, I grieved her loss. Every procedure, surgery, diagnosis, medication, assistive device (oxygen tanks, wheel chairs, walkers, all of it) just hurt. My mom made no effort to eat better, or exercise, or try at all. Watching that self-destructive decline was awful.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, in China I faced a number of issues. Unlike anything before, no surprise. Cockroaches, rats in the office (never seen, confirmed with poop presents on the desks), humidity, bugs, over crowding of people, internet restrictions (I don't miss the VPN...), etc. It was an incredibly developed city, with air quality better than other places (as a reference, I was about 30 minutes from Hong Kong). Regardless, I had a class of 37 students as I worked in a public school. In October I had hand foot and mouth disease, which was an awful experience. I relied on teaching with a microphone after, as the illness caused ulcers in my throat. Unlike Italy, I had very supportive coworkers. Kind of a mixed bag of people, some odd personalities but very kind and and present people. I took this job because of the unbeatable salary by the way - I paid off $4,800 in LASIK surgery, $5000 in student debt. Over Chinese New Year I went to Vietnam and Thailand. In September I survived a typhoon and regardless of being sick and it all being messy, I committed myself mentally to a second year. I wanted to get a good reference, pay my student debt, and return to Canada with savings. I could finally afford to pay my bills, eat, and live reasonably. I was doing 'online therapy' due to limited access to resources in China, I was focusing on my mental health (working through issues I had in Italy, in life in general).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAt the end of February my mom went into the hospital and within days she died. She was undergoing dialysis and because of her size, they sedated her to lay her flat (she couldn't lay flat by the way, normally). She had a breathing tube, a feeding tube. My oldest brother face timed me one morning (it's a 12 hour time difference) and I could see how sick my mom was. I talked to her, I told her I loved her, but she was unconscious. My brother said she squeezed his hand, but she seemed unresponsive. Situations similar to this had arisen before, she would go into the hospital for a few weeks (tell everyone to fuck off, literally) and then would go home and resume life. The doctors said she was stable. She had acquired some kind of infection, but they were treating her symptoms. No one expected it to happen suddenly. After explaining this to the best of my ability, the gradual decline over the last five years or so, it might seem like we were naive in thinking it would be okay... but we always got through these things trying to hope for the best.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI can't even tell you the day she died, I know it was a Sunday night for me and a morning there. Her heart just stopped beating. They tried CPR and my brother had to call it, as the designated family member. The doctors said she was suffering. I found out through iMessage, because why not... My brother's mistress texted me her condolences. Why not add on some family drama and emotional trauma?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI took three weeks off from work, I paid nearly $2000 to fly home (which is a 15 hour flight at best, not considering possible layovers). I paid for my boyfriend to come to Canada (he offered immediately, but wasn't in a position in that moment to just pay for that). As a side note, my boyfriend and I have been dating since Italy. He's visited Canada and China, my mom absolutely adored him. He was the first person in a long time who I let meet my family and spend time with my mom. He's been an absolute rock in my life.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, I guess the last reference point is my mom's funeral. It was a traumatic experience for me, which caused nightmares for several weeks. My aunt passed away 13 days after my mom, her older sister was also unwell and the timing just gutted my family. I couldn't even bring myself to go to her funeral, because of the experience at my mom's just weeks before. I was a mess.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI struggled with the time difference, I caught a cold, I wasn't sleeping or eating properly. I kept dreaming of my mom in her casket. For someone who was so ill and died in such circumstances, she didn't look like herself. I hadn't seen her since August in person, we hadn't spoken since the New Year. I was distancing myself to set boundaries, I was focusing on my self care and not letting myself become absorbed in family drama. So the last time I saw my mom was when she was dead. My sister in law said I could hold her hand (I had never touched a dead body, I barely had experienced a funeral as I had been really young at the time and didn't comprehend the experience as significantly as I could being an adult) and when I reached in, I was shocked. She was cold, hard. Her face had bruising, she was swollen. The funeral home did the best that they could, but it didn't look like my mom. I didn't get to say goodbye, I thought I'd say something to her but I couldn't bring myself to. I cried a lot. I kissed my mom's cheek and left a single rose and a cigarette in her coffin, both of those things she loved (despite my disapproval of smoking, I had to leave her with something).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI returned to China and got really sick. Apparently black mould is bad for you, I had been living with it since I moved into my school provided apartment and it had blossomed in my absence. I spent a few days at home with a fever, intestinal problems, cognitive disfunction. I finally asked another coworker who told me to get out of my place. I was in China, emotionally devastated, sick, totally beside myself in the situation. I just wanted to come home. My family promised me change, support, and safety. I felt like I couldn't continue working in that environment, even though I could have changed apartments I would have had issues with mould and cockroaches regardless (yay southern China). So I breached contract, I flew 15 hours for a third time to return home. I lost my financial stability, my mental stability is fragile. I'm adjusting to a reverse culture shock. I'm trying to maintain boundaries with my family, while living in their house. In many ways, I feel like a feral street cat someone took in.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMost recently I cry randomly, if something reminds me of my mom (which isn't hard, living in her old house and staying in my childhood bedroom). My older brother and his family live out of the city, my other brother lives downstairs. They are looking to fill the other rooms with roommates. I feel disconnected from people, like I have nothing to offer. Teaching jobs are difficult to find here (another incentive for staying abroad..) So I'm currently unemployed, I have two good friends. My boyfriend is in Italy, hoping to move to Canada in a few months. I'm trying my best to get into a routine, to be social, to be kind to myself. I went to a job fair, an employment service, I'm on a waitlist for a grief support group and I got a referral to a psychiatrist from my doctor. It just takes time, it takes effort. Some days I feel like bolting, I browse international jobs. Here doesn't feel like home, the moment doesn't feel right.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf you've managed to read this whole thing, I'm surprised and grateful. I've shared more in a post than I have with many of the people in my life. I'm hoping to connect with others who have experienced grief. Due to circumstances, it feels hard to connect to people in day to day life. As a euphemism, family and friends have said my mom wasn't an easy person to get along with. Our relationship was hard, the ending feels tragic. I have remorse, anger, regret. Mostly, I feel isolated and lonely, pretty hopeless.", "subreddit": "GriefSupport"}

Anyways I don\u2019t know where to begin but give some backstory. 2 weeks ago on April 18th 2019 my dad died. He was in the ICU for 2 weeks and in a regular patient room awaiting surgery for 1 week before he was transferred to the ICU. I am 16 my sister is 18 and my brother is 14. My dad has been sick and unhealthy my entire life and he was older, he was 72 when he died. He was overweight, diabetic, diagnosed with Parkinson\u2019s disease, suffered a heart attack, a stroke, had multiple surgery\u2019s, etc. all throughout my childhood/ teenage years. He wasn\u2019t active or very mobile so it was hard for me and my siblings because he tried his best to be as present in our lives as he could but it was hard for him. He struggled with his weight his entire life, he was very poor growing up and sometimes didn\u2019t have enough to eat. He started in the restaurant business when he got older and was super passionate and opened a few restaurants, but with his childhood traumas and stress he began eating and never stopped. I loved him so much he was my inspiration and my best friend. I miss him so much and I feel so empty and numb sometimes I feel sad but other times I feel nothing I feel like I\u2019m in a dream like this ain\u2019t happening this isn\u2019t real this is a joke it doesn\u2019t feel like he is dead like he is gone but he is some days I cry some I don\u2019t. Sometimes for a split second it feels real like he isn\u2019t anymore but then it just doesn\u2019t. I hate not feeling it makes me feel so guilty I hate that I feel nothing and I feel numb I want to feel and I keep telling myself \u201cmy dad is dead\u201d over and over again but I don\u2019t feel anything I cry when I see my mom cry or my sister or my brother but not because I\u2019m sad I\u2019m only sad sometimes at night when I look at pictures or the last voicemail he sent me a cry a little but then I fell numb again all I want is too feel so I can move on but I can\u2019t I don\u2019t know why. I literally saw him die before my eyes in the ICU I saw his heart stop them preforming CPR and shocking his heart to try and revive him I saw everything I held his dead hand and stand with his lifeless body talking to him and crying and then after that I felt nothing I shut down I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s a coping mechanism because if I did truly feel all my feelings I wouldn\u2019t survive but I feel horrible feeling nothing and I don\u2019t know what to do I miss him but I feel nothing how is that even possible he\u2019s my dad why don\u2019t I feel like my mom or my sister I don\u2019t understand. I don\u2019t understand how I\u2019m 16 and I\u2019m never going to see my dad again, I\u2019m never going to talk with him, laugh with him, play cards with him, drive around with him, sing with him. I wish I spent more time with him played more cards with him asked him more questions gave him more hugs tell him I loved him more there are still so many things I want to do with him and ask him and talk about with him but I can\u2019t and I just don\u2019t understand. Every moment and everything I experienced before April 18th my dad was alive but everything I experience after he isn\u2019t and that just doesn\u2019t feel real at all this doesn\u2019t feel real but at the same time it does I have pain but it\u2019s numb, numb pain.

I call 911 and ambulance is en route.  My mom says she can't see, and then I can tell that she's trying to breathe but not really taking any air in.  I keep asking the 911 operator what to do, and she keeps saying just wait.  I'm first aid and CPR certified, but in that moment my instincts just couldn't kick in.

I leave my daughter with my dad (who I haven't mentioned yet, but I'll get there).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy other sister meets us at the hospital, and we wait, ask front desk, wait more, ask front desk, waiting again, and are finally brought into a room where we are told that she had no pulse when EMS arrived.  They did everything they could.  It was likely septic shock.  She was 72 years old - one week shy of her 73rd birthday.  My mom was my guiding light and moral compass, and my family's matriarch.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy dad has debilitating depression and anxiety - and has been this way since he retired nearly 10 years ago.  My mom did everything for him, accommodated all of his needs, and took care of all of their finances for the past 10 years.  My mom's death is incredibly hard for him - they were high school sweethearts.  He can still do a lot of things for himself (shower himself, feed himself, etc.) but refuses to do other tasks for himself such as laundry and cook (they already had someone come weekly to clean).  He hasn't driven in at least 5 years.  My sisters check on him daily, but he is growing weaker and being alone so much is not good for his mental health.  I have tried to get him to come live with me and my family, but he says it is too far away (it's less than 300 miles).  I am the only one that is willing to take on his needs.  I am the baby of the family and my dad and I are especially close.  I don't understand how my siblings could turn their own father away, but in reality he probably wouldn't feel comfortable living with them anyway.  My sisters have found an assisted living facility for my dad, and he is on the wait list.  I went and toured the place, and I'm not totally against it, but my dad won't clearly say this is what he wants (one of my sisters has POA over my dad, so he doesn't really have to) - he won't say that it isn't what he wants either.  Both he and I understand that with his depression he probably won't be happy anywhere, but at least he would be taken care of.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOn top of all of this, my daughter saw her grandma die right in front of her.  My daughter and my mom were so close - like two peas in a pod.  I know this is hard for my daughter, but she really doesn't say much about it.  This is the first death in our family since she was born.  I asked the school counselor to check in with my daughter - my daughter said the counselor never reached out to her.  My daughter says she is ok.  I'm trying to be there for my daughter, but I am also gone every other weekend visiting my dad.  I call my dad twice a day.  My dad is always on my mind.  I'm tired.  I'm sad.  I know that I'm not being the best mom that I can be.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy husband is a good husband, but he doesn't understand how hard all of this is for me.  It was my mom, and she died in my arms.  He doesn't pretend to understand though - which is good for me.  He listens, he takes care of things while I am gone, he loves me.  But, again, I know I'm not being the best wife I can be right now.  I'm difficult to be around.  I'm always the planner and decision maker - and I just don't have the mental capacity to make any decisions right now.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnyway, if you've made it through all this, I'm willing to hear your advice.  I'm just at a loss - with everything - and looking for support.", "subreddit": "GriefSupport"}

But their deaths had nowhere near as heavily an effect on me as my dog\u2019s death. In my life this is the first inside dog of mine that I actually saw the dead body of and buried myself. It hit me like a giant truck. I haven\u2019t cried like that in so long and it hurt so much. Yesterday was the most emotionally taxing day of my whole life. I never let myself be too sad over death because I knew it was always there. But this was so sudden and I feel like it was my fault. If I let her back inside or was more mindful to check on her she\u2019d still be here. I had gotten too comfortable in the idea of her always sitting on the porch or only being in the backyard. It was pretty evident that she had grown away from going into the road. I\u2019ve let her outside to potty on her own so many times now that I had completely forgotten the possibility of this even happening she was practically immortal in my eyes. But it all came crashing down yesterday. The only thing different about yesterday was that she wasn\u2019t wearing her collar. She was my baby brother\u2019s best friend. They took a shine to each other as soon as she showed up on our doorstep 4 years ago. And I think what is hurting me the most is the guilt I feel for being the one whose fault it was for putting her in the position to be in danger. I destroyed a part of my family, I killed my brother\u2019s best friend, I broke my family\u2019s hearts. I\u2019m so scared of how this is going to affect my brother, because he was already traumatized from my hospitalization and near death back in December. And one of the biggest things he took solace in was our chihuahua. He told me so many times that he wouldn\u2019t know what to do if he ever lost her. And I was the one responsible. I killed her. If I let her back inside sooner she\u2019d be here and everyone would still be happy. My body feels so heavy and weak. If I wasn\u2019t here she still would be. I didn\u2019t deserve the second chance at life I was given. All I ended up doing was damaging my family.\n\nI felt like there was some sort of ray of hope because I looked into pet cloning. I know the result won\u2019t be the same dog, but basically a twin that was born later. But the company only accepts samples within 5 days post mortem and the fee is $1,600, but the express fee is $500 and with being out of work and worrying about hospital bills I can\u2019t afford either option in time. I don\u2019t want to get rid of the sample and give up because this felt like a light at the end of an endless black void. I promised my brother that I would make it up to him one day and this is what I hoped to pursue. Even if I could send in the sample it would still take forever for me to afford to pay for the actual cloning itself. But it was a goal that I am willing to pursue. But I had to make the hard decision to give up earlier today and got rid of the sample.\n\nI don\u2019t know how to accept this as reality and move on.

When I was starting out my career in India, I made a good friend - A. He was ambitious, had the passion to make his own rags to riches story and he even did it. When my then boyfriend and me broke up, A became a part of his friend circle, ex-bf even stayed with him for a while. We lost what we had, but we kept in touch...keeping tabs on each other. I moved on, got married and left the country.  Sporadic phone calls became messages and got fewer with every passing year.\n\nI messaged him the other day and his wife (I didn't even know he got married) replied to me and said that he died. I  immediately reprimanded 'him' for being silly and then messaged a couple of common friends - who I have also lost touch with.  They confirmed it. He died because his liver gave up, he had become an alcoholic.\n\nI'm sitting here, in another continent, thinking how did this even happen. How did this ambitious person come to choose alcohol for support. Did he keep bad company? Was alcoholism in his family? The few messages I didn't respond to, were those a cry for help? Does it matter? Why did he get married? Did the Indian society and expectations that it set burden him with too much? Where did he go off the track that he had made for himself? \n\nIn a way what has hit me the most is how I have lost touch with people of my past. How moving away from my country, getting busy making my life has taken me away from the people who were a part of making me who I am today. I know its inevitable, it happens and it is partly my fault - I should have put in more effort but it still bothers me. \n\nAnd then I think that I am being selfish and thinking of myself at a time when I should be thinking about A's family and wife and his friends who were there when he chose the path to destruction and couldn't help him. \n\nThat's it I guess.

He was just about to leave work and come home for the day. I got a call minutes after school ended, telling me to rush to his work. I didn't really know what that call meant at the time. I got to his work and experienced true sadness.\n\nWhen he passed, I lost two of my close friends, graduated, and within 5 months left my entire support network to go to school. I never really felt like I could just stop and breath, so I kept throwing myself into school, work, and sports, feeling numb all along the way. At college, I felt completely isolated from others because I couldn't figure out how to open up people and feel vulnerable again. Now, back home for the summer, I finally recognize my unhappiness and the same feelings of isolation, even with familiar faces. I keep running into feelings of futility, anger, and sadness. There is a hole in my heart, like one third of me is gone. I'd never really felt anger until I lost him. \n\nI feel myself getting further and further away from the memories I have of my dad. It's hard for me to hold onto the sound of his voice and I forever compare his hugs to those I receive from others..nothing is ever quite the same. This is the furthest I have felt from him, but the closest I have felt to my grief. I return to go through the same pictures, listen to music he liked, just to feel close again. I had dreams of him for a while, some, I would wake up in tears, but others I would feel like I had one of his hugs again. Even the sad dreams gave me feelings of comfort and a closeness to him that I have not been able to feel in a while. But lately those dreams do not come.

It just hurts knowing he won't be able to be there with us along the way. He was so kind and I miss him and his love.

I really, really liked having a sister.  I always wanted to marry someone from a huge family to have more.  (Married an only child.)  I feel like I'm setting up my child to be alone.  He is 2, and loves babies and his \"friends.\"  Yes, I know he's going to be okay...just need to adjust my view.  I had a lot of extended family that was close growing up and was very close to my sister even though we fought a lot.\n\nI've had some other really, really bad stuff happen in the last few months plus a lot of normal bad stuff, like needing to replace expensive appliances the same month my car breaks down.  Yes, I'm in therapy - I'm trying to stay not messed up so I can be a good parent.  My therapist has diagnosed me with a bad case of \"your life sucks right now.\"  (Okay, she phrased it a little differently.  She has no sense of humor.)\n\nAnyway, I think my sister had just had a mini-stroke when I called her today.  (She's had them before and more are expected.)  She wasn't making sense, but didn't seem aware that she was using the wrong words.  I called my parents to get in touch with the nurse that visits her (she's still in her own home...long story) and when they contacted her a few minutes later, she was very coherent.  \n\nSo nothing new (it's never anything new - just a little worse each day forever,) but just a reminder that soon I'm not going to have a sister anymore.  Soon I'm going to have to talk and talk and talk to people about her being gone.  I'm going to have to explain to my toddler son who loves his aunt that he won't see her again, that he has no aunts, uncles, cousins, siblings...\n\nShort version: I'm sad and feel like no one cares (even though I know they do.)", "subreddit": "GriefSupport"}

I have been writing a lot about my mother who past away some years ago, and I want to dedicate some time explaining how I feel about losing a great friend, not physically, but perhaps emotionally, for since he has gotten married, I have lost our six hour walks that scoured the landscape of the city in order to mend the emotional landscapes that pain procures.\n\nI remember how I met him, the same way we always form our conversations: half argument, full consideration, and part tough love but always with emotion and care. He made me cry and made me feel like I had a real brother; and we both chased the same lady, which left both of us. He once called me his guardian angel as I feel my mother is to me now.\n\nBecause I am dealing with marital strife now, and am alone, I guess I am in a different emotional-reflective mode, one that goes in and out of clarity and rationalism only to succumb the torrents of repressed and revealed emotions that make me feel as if I am going in and out of bright and sharp colors.\n\nWith this close friend, I could speak in different tropes, those that were ethical and those that were not, make those mistakes and feel safe, guided into a better vision to understand the world and all its suffering, but I think now I feel some of that old solace here, in this space, where I feel in this black field many are joining their emotional hands to connect.\n\nWhy did my mother have to go and not my father? Oh, that is dark thought, and I am sorry; oh, why does my wife deserve a lovingful mother, great career, and support while I have to figure it all out? I am okay with this fate now, for reading the many stories here has shown me that I have been alone for too long. \n\nDavid. No last name. Let's call him David. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nDavid: You are obsessed. You never loved her. \n\nEude: Ah. Okay. But, you too; eh, what was it then, for you?\n\nDavid: \\[No answer\\]\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI remember we talked about her, let's call her Dionysus, the girl we both chased like Quixote to Dulcinea. We were walking along the onyx paved suburb streets in Austin that hugged an untouched forrest. \n\n  \nDavid: Man. You remember Lawn Mower man?\n\nEude: Yeah. He was cool. \n\nDavid: Man. I saw him, the last time, dead and on the floor next to the street sign.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI had went to college for too long, wasting away learning things that only kept me at bay from the real things that mattered, like understanding love and mortality, two themes that every soul will spend the better part of their life understanding.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe best memory that night was walking on the esplanade, noticing a few cars hug the curb slowly in the middle of the night as we carried our camera equipment and talked about Europe and his experiences, which were always plenty and lively.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nDavid: So, I visited Dionysus in Spain, but I couldn't kiss her though the chance was there: I realized that I didn't have those feelings for her.\n\nEude: \\[Man, such a tease\\] Damn. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhat are these feelings? They swim around us quickly and fiercely till they eventually, thank God, tire and hibernate perhaps till waken. They are like muses and teases. They are like spectres and angels, leaving us confused as to whether if they are helping or distracting. But, it seems that they are telling us something beyond the evolutionary, that love is all that is needed.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI think I have some more time, energy, so I'll permit myself a bit more so I can understand through writing what is going on with me. It was my birthday today, but unfortunately I wasn't able to celebrate and my wife left me. I know it seems hard to fathom, perhaps unpleasant to hear, and all I have been doing lately was reading theories and fiction because I felt that was my calling to something I hope to lead me to where I need to be, perhaps here. Lately, this has been a safe space, though I have been writing more cryptic, for as of late, I have been scared of life. I am scared of so many things my friend, and if I take a Raslonikov edge, I am sorry, because I don't feel too much like me anymore.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI too like Balzac, perhaps, get caught up in fits, like Turner and his rabid water-coloring, like Giacometti and his spear like statues, something in the visceral provides that immediacy that fools me into control, fleeting power, a rush. Oh to be twenty again, I think for I am thirty-five year, past my mother and grandmother's sixty. I was an idealist telling myself that I would be on the top of the world when I hit one-hundred years, perhaps a decade past, when the two matriarchs of love from life passed so shortly, so harshly to make me a nihilist, cynic, deplorable person. I felt like an infant ripped from his mother, violently by death, disease, pain, suffering, confusion, change, laughter, paranoia, fear, sex, appearances of love, similitudes, gestures of knowledge, prototypes and models of supposed care, etc.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMother: \\[Looks intently at the wall papered wall\\] Why would you let someone into this world of pure suffering?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy mom told me this once. Her mother was nearly killed by her father's loaded revolver pointed at her mother's temple while he came home, once again, drunk and enraged. Do I have my grandfather's rage? despite never being violent as him? Am I no different?", "subreddit": "GriefSupport"}

She was bed ridden for awhile because her bones started breaking as she would walk after doing some emergency radiation treatments. \n\nHer decline happened over the course of a week. She was delirious, shaking and would completely doze off while talking and making absolutely no sense.

I ended up making the decision with my older sister to take her off life support since she had asked us specifically to not let that happen. Although I felt like I was respecting my mothers wishes I still feel guilty. I held her hand through it and stayed with her until she flat lined and had to immediately leave and go to a funeral home to make arrangements. I watched my mom die and that will stick with me forever. \n\nThis all happened so fast. She was supposed to have more time. I\u2019m 22 and had to bury my momma right before Mother\u2019s Day.

I feel like this is an important forum to a lot of people. I have posted on the cancer forum and received some ways to support a close loved one several months ago.

However, we were not very close, and she did not even like me for about half of my life.\n\nThe thing is, I have developed a depression worse than I have had in two and a half years (it is recurring), despite life being increasingly better. Because we were not close, I am not certain why my depression would be this bad. Do you think it could be her passing away, depression by itself, or maybe both? I am trying to make sure this does not happen again by finding out why I am depressed.\n\nIt is odd though, because despite behaving depressed, I do not feel so. Mostly it is a feeling of not really being able to identify my feelings, as thought I have none. Although, I feel happy at times and maintain principles and consideration.

I had just forgiven him literally 4 days before he died and our last interaction was me giving him an Oreo cookie in physics class three days before his death.\n\nWhen he died my friend called me to tell me he was dead and I was shocked but I did not cry until later that night (and the next night) I broke down but I was ok after a couple minutes. For the most part after that I was ok and I didn't cry often about it except maybe once every 1.5 months. Now recently if I see things that remind me of him I try everything to focus on something else but if I am alone I lose it and start crying and it happens more often now. I miss the dude so much and sometimes I think he will just walk in to the physics class like normal and we will learn about electromagnetism or I will see him in the hallway and wave like it used to be or he will go to the robotics meeting with his lanyard hanging out of his pocket but then I realized that it's impossible because he is dead. Or we will hang around in the machine shop like we used to sometimes but that can't happen because he is dead. I have these thoughts momentarily but then I remember he is dead but I still don't quite fully understand why he won't be in the halls.

I'm pretty sure I'm supposed to be ok now too but I read somewhere that if you had mixed feelings to the person who died then your grief will be different for some reason. I did have some mixed feelings before he died but before that we were best friends and he used to sit at my lunch table every day.

Almost exactly a year after I lost my mom to leukemia. \n\n\nI can\u2019t deal with it. I was joking with him on the phone and planning to go to a market together the next weekend. Making plans to visit that icecream shop with his favourite flavour together. He was doing active sport, tennis, cycling. Was eating healthy. He renovated his backgarden into a beautiful, blooming place to rest. Sure after my moms dead we all had a tough time. Especially my dad. They had just retired from their jobs and were looking forward to a lot of traveling and enjoying life. If anyone was to survive anything it was my dad. When he hugged me everything was alright. He gave me such a sense of security and home. He was always joking with us. When we played games he would take it easy on us and not taking it easy if that makes sense. And now he is gone forever. I got a call from a friend of his. Said he didn\u2019t show up for their tennis match and when he drove by his home and knocked on the door there was no answer. Had a bad feeling then. So I called my sister and asked if she knew something, maybe he was out, going for a walk or in the garden and didn\u2019t hear the phone. My sister also thought it was weird so she decided to drive to him. Said she would contact me as soon as  when she got there. My feeling got worse when I looked at the time ticking away and thinking she\u2019s got to be there already. And she would have called if everything was ok to calm me down. Then the phone rang and I knew it when my partner answered it. The colour of his face faded away. I knew it. I knew it. I knew it. \u201aYour dad.. is dead.\u2018 Was all he could say. Since then I\u2018ve been zoning out. I can\u2019t come to terms with it. He was lying on the couch in the living room like he was only taking a nap as he often did. He looked like he was sleeping. I wanted to shake him awake and when I touched his shoulder he was so cold. So so cold. The police think he was gone in his sleep. I really hope so. I hope he had no pain. I hope he didn\u2019t feel alone. I wish I could have said goodbye. Tell him how much I love him. How grateful I am for everything he has done for me. Us. The only thing that kind of gives my thoughts some rest is that hopefully if there is something like an afterlife that he and my mom are happy together again. The house, our home where we grew up feels so empty. Everything is looking like time has stopped. There are the leftovers from his lunch still sitting on the table. His tennis bag was packed. I\u2018ll never know if he\u2019d just gotten up from bed or if he was preparing to go to sleep. I miss him. So much. It hurts so much and I don\u2019t feel anything at the same time. I had so many wishes and imagined him to be there at so many events taking place in our lives. Making photos and making mischief. Playing with his grandchildren and being a awesome grandfather. It would have suited him so well. How can anyone be prepared for something like this. I stayed at the deathbed of my mom and had to decide to turn off the machines. I kind of knew it then and tried to prepare myself. It\u2019s impossible. This huge hole after my moms passing just got wider. And I don\u2019t feel like it will ever heal. It hurts. It hurts. It hurts. I feel so sad but I can\u2019t cry. I feel numbed and torn. Please give your parents a hug from me and let them know you care about them. I love you dad.", "subreddit": "GriefSupport"}

Unfortunately with school - they haven\u2019t been so understanding - and finances, I haven\u2019t been able to visit any more than that. \n\nToday I was told that his biological children are coming home from Israel and New Zealand to visit him because it\u2019s really getting close, and I was asked to visit if I was able. \n\nI want to, so bad.

Never with someone this close and I don\u2019t know what to do with myself. \n\nI feel so lost and even though I know that everyone dies and with his medical history he would likely die sooner than I expected, I had always hoped he would walk me down the aisle and that he would be there for my potential first grandchild and it becomes one of those things where all these situations pop into my head and I don\u2019t know what I\u2019ll do without him. \n\nI know I\u2019m all over the place...

I found it pretty incredible that she was willing to mimic different art styles, since it doesn\u2019t seem like a common thing, as someone following over 300 artists. She was pretty friendly and finished my commission pretty quickly.\n\nWe kept exchanging a lot of notes between that time and after. Enough to where she told me some personal stuff about her life, and to come to me the last couple of months to tell me how a Deviantart user I know, was getting impatient. Ignoring how she had constantly kept her watchers up to date, and that she would be busy trying to juggle with commissions while trying to finish her dissertation.\n\nThe same guy who complained eventually did get his work done, and disgustingly started complimenting her, even though he pmed her awful things. Besides him, I had to made up most of her clientele, caring enough about this whole artist to client relationship of ours to help her get settled in as much as possible on Deviantart.\n\nI can tell just from being on this site just how hard it is for an artist to get some kind of following and I did manage to get her a small one. It was a really nice back and forth communication, and she appreciated my efforts enough to follow some of the advice I gave her in trying to cater to certain audiences and also seeing me as a \u2018godfather\u2019 in her life. Never really had something that personal with an artist, so our relationship really meant a lot to me.\n\nI was the only client she had to finish commissions for, and I\u2019m a pretty patient enough person. There\u2019s tons of other artists around to wait on as well, so however long she wanted to take didn\u2019t matter much to me. I hadn\u2019t really been able to talk to her through notes since sometime last year since she stopped replying, but I knew she read what support I did try and offer here and there.\n\nShe finished her school enough some months back to return from a hiatus, and I regret that I didn\u2019t really try and talk to her around that time, having read a note today from a relative of hers, informing me that she recently died on Tuesday from a heart attack. I\u2019m supposed to graduate university a week from today, and I was hoping that when I had gotten a better job, I would have been able to commission her more. So it was really sad to hear the news.\n\nShe was a really kind person and quite possibly the best artist and client relationship I\u2019ve ever had while commissioning art. I really wish we had been able to talk more, and that I could have done a lot more for her.

This man swept her off her feet at age 16, got married at 19, and was like a brother to my mom growing up.\n\nHe was strict on us but also somehow the cool uncle. He lived in India, essentially separated from my aunt for work and to take care of his own father for the last several years so when I did see him, it was the best treat. Granted he smoked a pack a day and drank most people under the table, losing him was still a shock. To this day, I break down when I think of him so much later. I\u2019ve had many deaths in my family and have been surrounded by the feeling of grief but for some reason this has been hitting me more than I could\u2019ve imagined. It\u2019s made me questioned how long my own parents have, realizing people from their generation are now passing on. It kills me to see what my uncle left behind and how my cousins are still dealing with the fallout of this death. \n\nI\u2019m still half grieving for my aunt, cousins, and mom but I feel like I am no where near grieving for myself. I feel his spirit all around me and find myself missing him and thinking of him more than when he was alive.

I cried my eyes out, screamed my lungs out and then I just stopped eating. All this didn't last for more than 5 days. After which I had a funeral service for my dog. I gave a eulogy after which I didn't feel guilty about my decisions leading up to his death. It was cathartic. I got his bark inked on my chest, I gave away almost all his belongings, made an urn for him, decorated my house with his pictures and finally started grieving him. I missed him everyday. Everything around me reminded me of him. I cried, but they were small tears and stopped quite easily. My mom got him in her dreams. My brother and dad seemed to move on very quickly. But, I was stuck in this void. I wasn't sad or happy, I was numb. I started punched the punching bag in my gym and became quite good at, in fact last night I was so filled with anger I went to gym just to punch it and I didn't stop. Just didn't stop. I bought a bottle of port wine and a packet of cigarettes. I played lovely by billie ellish and love of my life by queen on repeat. Drank away the alcohol and smoked around 8 cigarettes. I made a few calls of help.My friends picked up and gave me advice and tried to calm me. It didn't matter.No one was there for me in that moment other than myself. I puked a couple of times, came to my bed and slept. And it was good sleep. I woke up feeling refreshed. I didn't get the experience I wanted at all. I wanted to connect with my dog, tell him I am sorry and just have people all around me taking care of me. I wanted the attention,love and care so bad. So fucking bad.  I didn't get it. Not one bit. Instead I made quite a fool of myself. People in the gym think I have serious rage issues. My friends think I am nut case. Worst of all I didn't get the connect with my dog at all. The one I thought I was doing all of this for. Which isn't true. Not one bit. I did it for myself, I wanted to feel pain and suffer , I felt it and I suffered.  I really did however I got something more of out of it. I think I got closure. That sometimes death just means death. And nothing more. That he just isn't coming back no matter I do or say. I have to accept the situation and create a new world. A world that does not include him. And I know for a fact that I can do it. Cause last night I realized I was enough. I didn't need people to help me. I mean support it great. But worthless if you don't feel like you are enough.

She was my only sibling.\n\nI desperately want to talk and reach out and broadcast to every person who loves or cares about me that I need help, but I don't know what to say. Or what to feel, or even what to think. I feel like I'm standing in a glass box on a crowded street with everyone watching me, but I can't speak. \n\nMy husband has been doing his best to help me in whatever way he can...he keeps asking \"What can I do for you?\" But all I can say is \"I don't know.\" I don't understand myself how I can feel inside like I'm screaming \"Please, talk to me!\" But not have anything to say.\n\nI feel so much all at once and I want so bad to find the right thing, or anything, to say to my parents. Or my sister's children. I can't imagine what this feels like for them. I want to help, but I just feel awkward and out of place and like its...like their grief is so much more important- my mom and dad lost a child, and my niece and nephew lost their mom. I don't feel like I have a right to need so much when I wasn't even a good sister to her.\n\nI keep having all of these horribly selfish thoughts about what this means for me. How my life will be different. My sister lived back home to take care of my parents and now there's only me. My husband and I had been discussing moving out of state for his career and now I feel like I shouldn't go, not ever, because I can't let them feel alone... my sister was staying over at my parents that night, when she died, my dad had to experience trying to wake her up... how could I ever let them be alone?\n\nI'm the baby...the youngest sister...even though I was The Smart One, The Good One, the one that Got Out, all the day-to-day drudgery of being a real grown up fell on my sister. I have a house, a career, a husband, but I'm not as strong as her. She, at 20, was the one who helped my mom handle funeral arrangements and mourning for my grandma when I was 12. Now, at 29, I can't do the same for them... I can't bear to have my dad ask me to help find my sister a dress for the funeral. To have him tell me the funeral home suggested something with a high neck and sleeves because they can't be sure what might be visible from the autopsy. \n\nI'm still struggling with every single realization that my sister is gone. I think of her so often now, I wish I'd have thought of her this much before. Responded to every text, every call, every Facebook post. Now, there is no one on the other end of the phone or screen. I can't tell her anything. No second chances...\n\nI thought about getting a tattoo in her memory. She always bugged me about getting one with her and I always said no. I'm not sure if now it would be wrong...", "subreddit": "GriefSupport"}

I'm breaking down.", "author": "Izulio", "self_text": "My dad, who has been my very best friend, passed away just on the morning of the May 7th.\n\nI'm 27, and I've lived with my dad my whole life. He had been pretty sick for a long time, but not the kind of sick where he was stuck in a bed. He had diabetes, and was struggling through heart failure. He had many medications, and was not good at taking care of himself. He even lost his toes on one foot to diabetes. I stayed close. I didn't want to move out, I wanted to stay and be with him. There were times when he WAS stuck in bed. He'd spend a month or two at the hospital during the nice summer. He was so miserable during those times.. and he DESERVED this summer. HE DESERVED IT.\n\nMy partner and I had been cooking for him, cleaning for him, and helping him with his medication pretty frequently these last four years.. although he had been sick and had medication to take most of my life, so I was used to helping him test his sugars, and take his insulin etc. We knew he wasn't healthy, but no one saw this coming. He had a heart attack and his arteries clogged in his heart. I didn't know it, but he confessed that he hadn't been taking one of his medications that keeps water off his heart for maybe 2 weeks. He passed away at the hospital.  He said the pharmacy lines were too long.\n\nI'm so hurt. I'm devastated. Beyond devastated. There's nothing I can type to describe what is going on inside my heart and my mind. I would have gone to the pharmacy and waited as long as it took if I knew. It hurts so much more, knowing we were caring for him.. living with him.. we were so close and I didn't know, and I couldn't help him because he didn't communicate things clearly. I feel guilt over this, I feel like I could have done something, or like it's my fault because I didn't make sure...because I wasn't paying enough attention.\n\nMy dad and I were VERY close! He was literally my BEST FRIEND! We saw each other every day. We ate together frequently ! I cooked for him when I could! (We live upstairs, he lived downstairs.)  He gave me advice! He drove me around places when he didn't have to (I don't drive, and I've been perfectly fine with the bus. I was never pushy about asking for rides.) Since he was retired, he loved being useful and driving us around.\n\nHe loved to ride motorcycles, and go boating. He loved being outside, and starting new projects. He loved classic rock, and blues! We played guitar together! He bought me my amazing electric ukulele!! We would laugh and sing and play board games and drink tea in the sun!! We were fixing up his boat so we could go out on it on my birthday next month!\n\nOh my birthday next month.... ohh my birthday.. next month.. I just.. I don't know what to do or think.. I was SO excited to spend it just me, my partner, and my dad. A quiet family birthday! Out on the boat... Have a nice dinner. Eat some frozen yogurt. I can't believe this is happening.\n\nI'm home alone today for the first time since he passed. It's still raw. It's still fresh. I'm in too much pain. I loved my dead immeasurably. Everyone did. He was just a hilarious loving person. He was even joking on his way to the hospital. The doctors that were working on him knew him and loved him for his outgoing personality. \n\nEverything is gripping me so tight. I've been going to therapy for about 2 years now for anxiety and other mental health issues. I've been practicing mindfulness in all my sessions, so I know breathing exorcises. I know grounding techniques, and all that jazz. But this is too much. \n\nYesterday I was numb, and it hit my partner. I was able to smile with a friend. I was able to have some good thoughts. Today is just the opposite. I'm howling, screaming, crying. I'm on my knees. I can't breathe. The fact that I'll never be able to see my dad again. I'll never be able to hug him again. I'll never be able to laugh with him, hold his hand, play guitar together, or go on that boat. We never got to go on that new boat we were fixing. My head is pounding, my throat is dry and hurting, my chest feels like it's going to explode.\n\nHow do I go on? How do I get through this? I've never lost a parent before, or anyone this close to me.  \nI'm so scared I'm terrified of the future. I don't know where I'll have to go, or if I'll be able to keep his house. He left no will or beneficiaries (God why was he so bad at filling out paperwork.) I'm full of anxiety and grief.\n\nI need to clean, but I'm so heartbroken I can barely move. I'm sure this whole post is a mess, as I word-vomit my feelings.  \nI just needed to get it out. I can barely see through these wet eyes.", "subreddit": "GriefSupport"}

I didn\u2019t know what to do with myself or how to handle her death. I got her when I was 3/4 years old, and she was originally a present for my Papaw. She ended up becoming our dog when he could no longer give her the care she needed. She lived to be 17 years old and was the best little wiener dog I ever knew! She would literally act like she was on her death bed, and the next week, she\u2019d be bouncing around like a puppy. She was so resilient. I said my goodbyes to her probably around 5 times since she was 12, or so. And it always made me feel like she\u2019s live forever because each time, she\u2019d bounce back. Anyways, when she was declining, she would have seizures, she never had any traction on the floors, she would cry out in pain, and couldn\u2019t see. It was really really tough to witness all of that. I\u2019m tearing up right now thinking about it. She lost a lot of weight and couldn\u2019t hear, also. I hated it. When it was time to put her down, I remember saying goodbye and she wouldn\u2019t even kiss me or look at me (because she couldn\u2019t see me or hear me), and it about broke my heart. My parents took her to the vet and came back 30 minutes later with a large cardboard box with her inside. I remember going down in the basement as my dad was transferring her body into a plastic container, and I just saw her limp body and it freaked me out... I could also tell it was really difficult for my dad. He brought the box up moments later, and I remember touching her body and it was still a little warm. It was so unreal and really fucked with me. I\u2019ve had her my entire life (I\u2019m 22) and to know that she was just gone, absolutely broke me. She was also my last connection to my papaw, who had died years before. I mourned her death, almost crying every day for at least 6 months. For me, it seemed like everyone else got over her death pretty quickly, which made me angry and I didn\u2019t know how they did that. I miss her so much. \n\nAnyways, fast forward to tonight, i was getting ribbon out of the guest room closet and saw this felt birthday hat/headband. I immediately had a flashback of the time we put it on Maddie\u2019s back on her 15th birthday. I grabbed it out of the closet and examined it. I saw it covered in her hair and I just lost it. I bawled. It was so emotional because it\u2019s literally the only thing I\u2019ve found in such a long time that still has her hair on it.Toys, brushes, beds are gone). I had flashbacks of her walking in our kitchen and doing things only she would do. It was like I just lost her. And I kept thinking, \u201cwe forgot about her\u201d. It really weighed on me. I\u2019m having a hard time right now. Most people I talk to say that this isn\u2019t normal, but I feel lost without her presence.\n\nAny advice or relatable stories to help me? \n\nAlso sorry for typos or things that may have not made sense.", "subreddit": "GriefSupport"}

It was horrible, honestly. The first year wasn\u2019t so bad because even though she was on very intense chemo her body still handled it well and she had the strength/energy to do a lot of things still. But the second year was tough. Over time, I think the chemo weakens your body more and the cancer kept spreading albeit slowly. She was extremely lethargic and we had trips planned that she enjoyed a lot but if she wasn\u2019t on a trip she mostly just sat around all day and even developed bed sores from sitting. I think her own mortality was getting to her as well and she was very depressed. Having that warning that she was going to die was kind of nice though because in those two years I got to visit her a lot and everything both of us needed to say was said before her passing.\n\nWhen it actually happened I was devastated. It was a very dark day for me. My fianc\u00e9 and I had moved up our wedding two years to June so that she would be able to be there. Obviously she won\u2019t be there anymore but she did a lot of the planning and we\u2019re still going through with the wedding because it\u2019ll still be very special. The first few days it was hard to think about this though. My fianc\u00e9 asked if I was okay and still wanted to go through with the wedding and I almost felt annoyed that he could be thinking about something so happy when I was feeling so sad. \n\nI flew up to my mom\u2019s house with all my siblings that I am very close with. It was nice to be all together, put our phones away for the weekend, and cry together. We told stories, went through my mom\u2019s jewelry and clothing to keep things for ourself. It was an extremely emotional time and the grief I felt took a toll on my body, I had body aches and pains and just felt very weak.\n\nNow I\u2019m home and back to work and I feel kind of....okay? But I feel bad about feeling okay! I mean, I\u2019m not perfect but I\u2019m able to get dressed for work and have fun with my coworkers and humor is a big way for me to cope so I tell jokes about my mom\u2019s death.

I felt relieved (and guilty for feeling relieved) that I wouldn\u2019t have to acknowledge today or celebrate someone else\u2019s mom. We, my husband\u2019s mom and I, never had the \u201ccall me mom, you\u2019re part of the family now\u201d conversation and we never will-the family as a whole aren\u2019t my biggest fans. So, today I should have been able to maintain willful ignorance that today is mother\u2019s day and my mom isn\u2019t here for me to celebrate with. \n\nA little bit ago I received a text message from his mom \u201cHusband\u2019s Brother is hosting Mother\u2019s Day grilling at their house today after 2:00. Hope you can join us (smiley face)\u201d. I get it she is mom, her daughter is a mom, and her other DIL is a mom and they deserve enjoy their day together. \n\nI know it\u2019s not fair to her but I am mad and hurt and just bewildered by this invite. I know she wants to celebrate being a mom with her kids after all that is what today is about. I just can\u2019t fathom right now how someone who is a mom can completely ignore the fact that you just invited someone; whose mom is dead, who is spending their first mother\u2019s day without their mom, whom you\u2019ve never said anything to about wanting a mother/daughter like relationship with to a cookout celebrating mothers without a single word about how hard today might be, or how my mom isn\u2019t here to celebrate, or ANYTING at all acknowledge that today isn\u2019t just another normal Mother\u2019s day. I know it is not her responsibility to placate me or do anything for me and she is merely trying to celebrate this day with her kids while including me as the spouse of her son. None of that changes how I feel right now though. \n\nI took some time to mull over my response to this group text between the three of us; we won\u2019t make it husband is sleeping and I\u2019m mourning, we won\u2019t make husband is sleeping and my mom is dead, or husband is sleeping and I\u2019ll be celebrating my mom sitting on the couch crying now thanks to you and trying to forget today exists. However, I politely responded that my husband was on his normal sleep schedule (he works nights) and we wouldn\u2019t be able to make but to \u201cEnjoy the cookout\u201d. The response, \u201cOk. We\u2019ll miss visiting with you.\u201d I keep trying to tell myself that it's not up to her to acknowledge my mother's death or my grief but I just can't help feeling so angry at what feels a like a blatant disregard for what today might feel like for me.\n\nSo now I'm just sad that my mom isn't here, angry that there was no consideration/acknowledgement about what today might mean for me, relieved that my husband isn't awake which means we don't have to go, and guilty that I'm angry and relieved.\n\nI really just wanted a quiet day where I got to pretend I didn\u2019t know what today was. I was even staying off of Reddit knowing other people celebrating or grieving and I didn\u2019t want or need the reminder. I know today is hard for a lot of people so I hope that you get to spend today doing whatever you need to get through it.", "subreddit": "GriefSupport"}

He started the treatment in January 2019. The therapy made the cancer smaller, but his body got weaker every day. He could not eat or drink anymore. And he was constantly in pain.\n\nThen they brought him to a palliative care in another hospital.

He tried his best and at first it looked like he would get better.\n\nBut in the last 2 weeks his health declined extremely and in the last 3 days he could not speak anymore or move.\n\nYesterday i wanted to visit him.

I wanted to jump in the car and visit him. But i thought i don't habe to hurry and so i smoked a cigarette with my mum. Then i drove to the hospital.

I thought they just finished washing him, but she came to me and told me: \" he did it, he has finally come to peace\".\n\nI was in the hospital every day for the last months. Most of the time i was there 8 hours straight or even slept there.\n\nIf i had just left earlier, i would have seen him the last time alive and could have hold his hand.\n\nSome days before he died he told me that he is very proud of me.

For a little context--my mother was gone during most of my early childhood. She battled with an opiate addiction, and left me to be raised by my abusive father. To her credit, no one knew the abuse was happening except me. It wasn't until she died that I was able to let go of the negative feelings that I had toward her for leaving me with him--these should have been let go a long time ago.\n\nShe was able to overcome her battle with addiction and came back into my life during high school. We were able to have what I believe was a good relationship. It was never nurturing as mother-daughter relationships should be, but it was good. We became the closest we had ever been during this time, until she was diagnosed with two brain tumors and underwent several surgeries to remove them. Her personality changed as a result of the surgeries, and I felt like I had to start all over again rebuilding our relationship. This was so incredibly difficult for me, as it took a long time to cultivate the relationship that we had built after she came back into my life.\n\nAs expected, our relationship never returned to what it was. I was not angry with her, but there was distance between us that wasn't there before. I moved an hour and a half away to start my undergraduate degree. She began working and going to school to fulfill her dream of becoming a certified peer support specialist to help others battling with addiction. It seemed as though we continued to drift farther apart--her not wanting to intrude on my new life and me not caring enough to make it better.\n\nDuring my last year of undergrad she was diagnosed with gastrointestinal stromal tumors. This is a relatively rare form of cancer, and she required several surgeries to remove the rapidly growing tumors from her stomach and intestines. I was not focused on the magnitude of the severity of this diagnosis, as I was about to begin graduate school, and I was too worried about passing the GRE and getting a graduate assistant position. \n\nThe surgeries were a relative success, and she began one of the only two forms of chemo used for this type of cancer. At the same time, I went head first into graduate school. For two years, I focused on nothing but working two jobs, being a graduate assistant, and keeping up with my classes. My entire life was graduate school. I only came home on holidays and birthdays, never staying long enough. I neglected to even send my momma text messages of support--one of the simplest, quickest things I could have done to show her that I loved her. \n\nThe day after I passed my master's thesis defense on March 21st, she found out the chemo was no longer slowing the progression of the cancer. I went home to be with her for the follow-up doctor's visit. She began the other form of chemotherapy in the hopes that it would work as long as the previous chemo. I thought everything would be like it was, and I went back to school to finish out the semester. I did not support her enough during this time.\n\nUnfortunately, a few days later she had to be admitted to the hospital for severe vomiting and confusion. We found out that the chemo was causing a condition called PRES, which is swelling in the brain. This swelling caused her to be very confused and affected her vision greatly. She made the decision to stop taking chemo. She progressed from the cancer wing of the hospital to hospice one week later, and she died after being in hospice for two weeks. \n\nI graduated with my master's degree on May 4th. My momma was not there to see me walk, and to see the accomplishment that kept me from supporting her when she needed it the most. I have had to learn in one of the worst ways possible that you cannot get back lost time. Sure, this is something everyone talks about in a cliched way. But it isn't until you feel sick when thinking about the time you cannot get back with someone you love, someone that needed you that it really resonates with you.

It\u2019s tough.", "author": "me_approximately", "self_text": "Hello \n\nI\u2019m not sure I\u2019ll do a good job of summing this up, but here goes.\n\nI feel lost, and feel like no one truly understands.\n\nMy dad passed away a few days ago, peacefully, he had battled a horrible, rare genetic lung disease and was being looked after at home (by my mom, and the last few months, carers too).\n\nHe was housebound for pretty much the last two years, and the last year completely bed bound.\n\nMy mom looked after him which is amazing and not to be underestimated.\n\nMy mom shouted at me when I was little, she didn\u2019t swear really or call me names, but everything was shouty, I nearly always wondered what I had done wrong, and often ended up in my room crying.\n\nMy mom and dad have been together for a long time (Dad was in his 70s, Mom is 60s) and their relationship was not a straightforward one. My gran and grandpa had an incredible relationship, and I have so many stories to treasure.\n\nBut there aren\u2019t any for my mom and dad. I don\u2019t know about before I came along (though I learnt from my uncle there were plenty instances of my mom lashing out at family members and causing difficult situations after they were married). \n\nMy uncle (dad\u2019s brother) is close and I\u2019m very lucky. We get on well, and I grew up with lots of dads side of the family around (moms side of the family are great, but we lived geographically very near to dads side).\n\nI had a lot in common with dad - in particular sporting interests (he was sport mad) and I shared that with him and my uncle too. We are all positive people really and very loving. My dad was an incredibly gentle soul.\n\nWhen being cared for, my mom would still shout and lose her rag. She told me recently that she always went in to apologise but I don\u2019t believe her.... I\u2019ve never once heard her apologise, only act overly nice or give the silent treatment after a blow up.\n\nWhen we were both my his side in the hospital, a little while before the end she brought up the fact that she knows she is a \u201cranter and raver, but it\u2019s just me, it\u2019s just my way of coping\u201d.\n\nI\u2019m still processing this. I don\u2019t know what to do with the information.\n\nI\u2019m so sad that I\u2019ve lost my lovely dad - but am so grateful for just how many people ah e been in touch with such kind words, all sayings what a gentleman he was, you have to go far to find a nicer guy, and lots of funny stories.\n\nIt makes me sad that my mom never seems to have any of these.\n\nShe is different with other people around. My boyfriend was her for a night. Mom has a tendency to interrupt people, and that doesn\u2019t change, but she\u2019s less argumentative when he\u2019s around. She would only shout at my dad (while he\u2019s hooked up to an oxygen tank barely able to breath) while I was there.\n\nShe admired herself that she would \u201ccajole\u201d him whatever that means. On his last holiday a number of years ago, I joined them for a few nights. He had a buggy then, and a part briefly stopped working. It wasn\u2019t his fault. She said \u201che\u2019s bloody useless\u201d. I said not to shout, he said \u201cyes she\u2019s always shouting\u201d. :-(\n\nAll of these memories swirling in my head.\n\nI\u2019ve been home with mom since it happened early Saturday. As mentioned it\u2019s just me and her in the house now. We were watching a crap news programme about Brexit today, and we add half hearted comments to the debate. I won\u2019t go into detail but our political differences came out and I knew it was a bad path. I just said I don\u2019t really want to get into it (in a nice way). \n\nThen she started telling a story about a certain politician (ok it\u2019s obvious it\u2019s Jeremy Corbyn but politics is so irrelevant here so please pleas keep politics out of replies if you can I\u2019d be so grateful)... all I said was it\u2019s a mistake to think I\u2019m his biggest fan (because of my age she thinks I am) but that a lot of stuff said about him isn\u2019t true. She then raised. Her voice \u201cI\u2019m sorry but I was there, you weren\u2019t around when he was marching trough the streets wearing a mask!\u201d \n\n\u201cAh? I wasn\u2019t where?\u201d\n\n\u201cAll those fascist Marxist matches he went on wearing those masks!\u201d\n\nI literally don\u2019t know what she means but the problem is the shouting at me not what she said. And the timing of it. I then went to another room and got really upset.... reminding me of my childhood basically.\n\nI\u2019m trying to deal with dad dying but also the difficulties in understanding my moms temperament.\n\nI know she\u2019s hurting too and I\u2019m trying really hard to be a good daughter. But sometimes I feel like she actually resents the closeness I had with him and the things in common I shared with him and other family members.\n\nI don\u2019t even know what I\u2019m expecting in terms of replies and you can\u2019t really get the full breadth of a situation down in a post, but I guess it helps just to write words.", "subreddit": "GriefSupport"}

That I needed him to make sure that everything was going to be okay, even though I just turned 43 years old. \n\nShe smiled, got up to get a sheet of paper, that she handed to me. \"read point 4 and 5\".\n\nIt was about acceptance and seeing the silver lining in the situation. About reconciling the immense sadness of losing someone with the fact that life can be good, and even in some aspects, better without them.\n\n\\---\n\nI'm an only child. My dad loved my mom with all his heart, and from what I understood, she didn't love him that way. She had found a good, reliable guy and that was okay for her.  \n\nMy dad told me that when I was 2, he had packed our stuff and was about to leave her. But he ultimately stayed and they had a long, almost uneventful marriage. I was the glue that kept them together. Their sole reason to keep being a couple. \n\nWe had a special and strong bond, dad and I. \n\nA year or so before he died, I called him. I was lost and distressed. I had just learned that the IVF treatments we were doing didn't work. I, his only son, wouldn't have a kid of my own. Having a grandkid was something that had him hanging on, even though he was sick. \"I'm going to be there on my grandkid's first school day, standing up proud!\"\n\nThat phone call was tough for both of us. He didn't really know what to say, I was crying my eyes out. I knew he was sad too. \n\nA week later, he was admitted and would spend almost the rest of the year in the hospital, with a few days breaks here and there. \n\n\\--\n\nWe had the chance to talk, alone, for four hours, 6 weeks before he passed.

It was the last significant conversation I had with him.\n\nThat time, and the last time I saw him. \n\nMom and I went to visit him at the hospital on january second. He was at the dialysis room, so we squeezed in there. While my mom was speaking to him, he moved his head so that he could see me, sitting behind her. He did a kissing motion with his lips, along with a head nod, asking for me to come close. I kissed him on the cheek. \n\nWe spoke of sweet nothings. I showed him pictures and videos of our new cat, of the renovated house that he so wanted to see, of my huge year-end bonus at work. He was getting tired so after 15 minutes, we decided to leave. I tucked him in, because he was cold. I kissed him goodbye, caressed his head and walked away. \n\nAfter a few feet, I stopped and looked back at him. He smiled. I came back, gave him another kiss and left. \n\nI think we both knew this was the real last time\n\nAnd he was ready, he knew I'd be ok without him.\n\n\\----\n\nA week and a half later, I was about to drive to my hometown to spend the day with my mom and visit my dad.

I would\u2019ve preferred to have them presented to me differently, but sometimes we don\u2019t get to choose the way life unfolds. \n\nGrief has been a part of my life for as long as I can remember. My first dads anniversary of his passing is tomorrow, gone from his physical form for 22 years, and the pain still resides within me, just more distant even though I do see it come up very often these days. \n\nWe all know, myself more than many, that life is fleeting and unexpected but I forget that truth a lot. I forget that most things don\u2019t really matter and let them get to my head more than I\u2019d like to admit. But as his situation grows more serious by the day, it\u2019s easier to see that the little stresses that I\u2019ve let consumed me really won\u2019t amount to anything in the end. \n\nHere are some of the lessons I\u2019ve learned:\n\n* Sometimes I must walk the path alone. \n* It\u2019s okay to ask for help or lean on people, too: it seems contradictory to my first point but it\u2019s not. Our journeys are two-fold; there\u2019s one we do by ourselves and one that we take others along for the ride.\n* Take things one day at a time: there\u2019s no need to carry things that are heavy with you all the time.\n* Everything does happen for a reason, even if we can\u2019t see it immediately. \n* Try to see the light among the darkness. It might be really hard but I promise if you open your eyes enough, there\u2019s some light there. \n* Be grateful for each moment you have, because you don\u2019t know how many more you will get. \n* Be kind to yourself, and be kind to others - you don\u2019t know what someone else is going through. \n* If you can, help someone in need (but you must help yourself first.\n* Forgive. Forgive yourself, forgive others. There\u2019s nothing worth holding onto because in the end, it doesn\u2019t matter. \n* Death doesn\u2019t end a relationship, it\u2019s just a transition to a new journey. \n* Love is the best thing we will ever do. My dad doesn\u2019t recognize or respond to much, but he always recognizes me and reacts to my and my moms voice. He feels the love, even when he can\u2019t feel much else.", "subreddit": "GriefSupport"}

I try to remember him that way. \n\nMy dad passed away from a Glioblastoma 1/19/19. He was diagnosed 6/25/18. He went through oral chemo and radiation. He lost his ability to walk. He tried so hard to work with physical therapy to be able to walk me down the aisle on my wedding day. He was never able to regain his strength and coordination. However, he was able to be wheeled down the aisle at my side by one of my brothers. I\u2019ve never seen him so happy in my life. After my wedding his health took a turn for the worse. He was completely dependent of care now. I recently moved 12 hours away and decided I was going to move back to help my brothers take care of him so he could remain at home as he wished. He wanted to do one more round of chemo, a battle I knew I would lose. I didn\u2019t want him to have side effects from the chemo. But looking back I\u2019m happy he tried once more. He told my aunt and I he \u201cdidn\u2019t want to go out without a fight\u201d. He was a true warrior, and he held on. \n\nWe were lucky enough to enjoy one more Thanksgiving and Christmas with him. I truly believe it was his gift to us. I returned home with my husband right before New Years. As I said goodbye to my dad, he thanked me for everything I had done. As I lay there with my head on his chest I tried not to think this was the last time I would talk to him. It really seemed like he was in a good place. My brothers called me a week later to tell me that he was doing worse and we decided to call hospice. Three days later I flew back home to be with him as he was actively dying. I was the one medicating him with morphine, every hour to lower his respiratory rate. I am a nurse and have cared for many dying patients. But seeing the man who I always considered to be my hero, mentor, and biggest support lay unresponsive in bed where a couple weeks prior he was joking and laughing with me breaks my heart. I knew he could still hear me and told him I was there with him, that my brothers were there, and that we loved him and it was okay to let go.

Needless to say, I hate Spring. \n\nA little back story: mom was my lighthouse in our toxic and abusive family. When she died, it was as if my whole world shattered. Ultimately, I cut my branch off the family tree and planted it by itself. Breaking ties with the rest of my family was easily the best decision I made for myself and my mental health. \n\nAfter her death, I got married and had a wonderful little boy who I wish she had gotten to meet. My husband, son, and in-laws became my family. My only family. They are wonderful, caring people who took me in and gave me the support and space I needed to grieve and recover. I will forever be grateful for that. \n\nEarlier this year, I asked my husband for a divorce. We still love and care for each other but it\u2019s just time to let go. The friendship was successful but the marriage was not. We are processing the divorce as well as can be hoped for but his family is not taking it well, especially his dad. I know they still love me but something, understandably, has been lost with the divorce. \n\nThe reason I bring this up is because this is the first time I have been completely with out family support my whole life. And it\u2019s during the worst time of year. \n\nI have never needed/wanted my mom\u2019s love and support so much since her death as much as I need/want it now. I had a lovely Mother\u2019s Day with my son but once his dad picked him up and I was alone, the weight of my loneliness really set in. All week, my grief and depression have taken over and I have barely been functional. I have been eating and taking care of basic needs but I haven\u2019t been able to talk to anyone or go to work. I cry all the time and just lay in bed. \n\nGrief ebbs and flows, so I know I just need to ride it out. I know I\u2019m ok.

My dad was hospitalized about 60 days ago he had a hemorrhagic stroke, almost 2 weeks in the ICU and then rehab. I stayed back home for about a month since I live across the country. I did everything I can in my power to comfort him and be there for him. I tried my best to persuade him to move out of NYC and live with me in sunny and retirement friendly Vegas...but nothing worked. I am disappointed because after I flew back home my half siblings did not take him for a followup appointment with the neurologist...because you know a stroke is a neurological issue...and when I spoke to the doctor when we was in the ICU and they pretty much said they were trying to figure out if the stroke affected the frontal lobe of the brain that affects emotions....till this day I don't know.\n\nAfter rehab, he got out but went back again to the hospital about 2 weeks ago. He was under observation and was sent back to rehab again. He's not himself anymore, he used to be positive and cheerful but ever since the stroke left him wheelchair bound he hasn't been same since losing his independence. From what my friend has told me, my dad is going through his own grieving process. It was kinda hard to see other people in his situation or other people that are way worse off wanting to be able to go downstairs at the activity room in the rehab center or outside.  He's losing the will to live no matter how many times I try to sugarcoat hope in this situation. Its no longer a matter if but when because of the mountain of health issues pertaining to his heart and genetic issues that is going against his recovery on top of him being diagnosed with major depression. No matter what I say I do not have any power over this situation at all and to make matters worse my family situation is super complicated to the point  where I don't want to be associated with them even when I do reach out to them its just super vague answers.\n\nLiving with the anticipatory grief makes me already feel like I am going through the grieving process already, like any day now I am gonna get that very same phone call that I have to get the next flight out. I tried to have closure with him before I left and told my dad that no matter what happens I will be okay.\n\nI've been feeling so empty and withdrawn from all the happy people around me, I just can't force pretending to be happy anymore and pretend that everything is gonna be okay when its not. I am mentally exhausted now that the tears aren't coming out, its just that heavy feeling of sadness and emptiness that the inevitable is going to happen.  My work is being affected because I have a big mental fog right now that I just can't snap out of it. Even when I try to distract myself I just feel numb and empty. I thought I accepted things for what it is that he declined again after getting out to hospital to live with my half siblings and then he went back to the hospital again 2 weeks ago....My husband and I knew that was gonna happen and I am afraid about the same fate again once he gets out of rehab again.\n\nA year ago my dad and I had this conversation about his final wishes and I am living with the guilt every since day this is not what he wants. I was already distraught and grieving since then....\n\nSo that's why I am going home memorial weekend to see what's going on with him 5 hour flight back to go back home. I am not sure what else can I do being 2000 miles away aside from sending cards and talking to him for a few minutes when my mom aka his ex wife visits him. \n\nI saw a lot of suffering and pain in his face with him being in the ICU. That's why I already feel like I am going through the grieving process. \n\nWhat am I supposed to do in this situation?

I think sometimes that I have a little angel watching on me. But the longer I felt spared, the most I feared the tragedy of loss coming to me. I know it might sound stupid but I feel like I might not be prepared for loss. \n\nPeople around me often told me I could overcome any hard times as they see me as a strong person as I used to never show how affected I am. I just really think that I had been spared by life.\n\nI made of list of things I lost since last summer. Some might look trivial but if they are on this list they all had an impact on my mental:\n\n* September 2018: lost my first cat while on vacation. He left from where he was petsitted. Never heard of it since. (I must precise that I really, really am a cat lover, I can\u2019t picture to live without one)\n* November 2018: lost my love. My girlfriend of 5 years left me. I won\u2019t go about the explanations here but I took it really hard. It felt like the darkest time of my life. (and I can't thank r/breakups enough)\n* December 2018: lost my car due to lack of maintenance (my fault). Blamed myself and it caused some financial stress. I was kind of numb by the breakup at that time so I can\u2019t tell I was really sad because of it.\n* Early 2019: lost my main loved activity (not my job): my music band. I always considered them as family (I have been doing this for 10+ years). I know I can find a way to recreate something around music and I still do but it feel like another pillar of my life gone.\n* May 2019: lost my second cat a few days ago. He was kind of my best friend when I was in the dark time of the breakup. I can\u2019t tell how much I love him. It\u2019s only been a few days he is gone but I already lost hope of seeing him again. Let me explain: I live in a small village, everyone know my cat and everyone love him, he is very friendly and very affectionate with everyone. Everyone love cats except this one person who my neighbours heard saying he would get rid of all the cat in the village. (A second one have been missing since a few days). I haven\u2019t lived here for long so I don\u2019t know him at all (we came here with my girlfriend for peace and tranquility a year ago). \n\nThis particular last loss hit me pretty bad right now. I know you can lose a cat to the road, to the disease, or even to the wilderness but I can\u2019t begin to understand how one people living 50m from me would kill my best friend. As an introvert I always liked being alone but right now I really fear loneliness and I even fear living close to such people. \n\nI decided to move out of the house. I feel that I need a fresh start but I fear that I will lost something else or that I somehow brought all this on myself or maybe I could have seen it coming. I feel that a lot of things around me are falling apart and I just feel powerless.", "subreddit": "GriefSupport"}

I loved her so much. She was a great lady, worked in public health, was basically a single mother. She was diagnosed 2 years before she died and a year before she died she found out that it was something that couldn\u2019t be beat.  She kept all this a secret from her family (besides our dad who told his friends and random people we barely knew). She continued to work up until about a month before she died. She never gave anyone any reason to be worried about her, she always was positive, she always listened to me and was always genuinely interested in what was going on in my life. I didn\u2019t appreciate her enough when she was alive because she put up with our dad who hurt us all so much but I\u2019ve come to understand that it wasn\u2019t wrong to be mad at the adults in our family for knowing how our dad was and essentially doing nothing to stop it.\n\nMy dad has a bunch of mental health issues in conjunction with an extremely fucked up child hood. which led him to have a drinking problem and be emotionally abusive. He left to go drill oil when I was in fourth grade so I only saw him for a few weeks every couple of months. During that time he cheated on my mom a lot. I saw him kiss a woman in front of me and my mom. My mom during that time had a friend that was a guy (I doubt she was cheating on him) but after days of him screaming at her in \u201cprivate\u201d we had a family meeting (me, my little sister, mom, dad) in which he basically just screamed at mom in front of us. I have a lot of really weird almost surreal memories from that period of my life. When he came back from oil drilling and got a job in our city  it was worse, like walking on eggshells constantly unsure what was gonna make him freak out. Senior year things really started to click for me, I came to understand how fucking bad all the stuff he did was. Ever since then he would freak out on me and I would leave home and stay somewhere else for a couple weeks. This cycle was happening while my mom was sick too, I was avoiding him at all costs up until a few months before my mom went into palliative care. \n\nWhile my mom was in Palliative care he was still a dirtbag, our drinking at the bars leaving me and my little sister to administer her medication. He got a girlfriend or was seeing other women while my mom was in palliative care and then started bringing them around a few Months after she died. My little sister was still living at home and it was a terrible time for her. She would have no idea where he was most of the time he would show up randomly drunk and yell at her to clean. She asked him several times not to bring his girlfriends around but he did. Then about 3 months ago we found out he was stealing my sister\u2019s social security money and when we asked him simple questions about it he freaked out about it and accused us of various things. My sister lives with me and my wife now. I haven\u2019t seen or talked to my dad since February. He pays my phone bill and he texted me randomly on the 23rd saying he wasn\u2019t paying for my phone bill anymore and I just fucking laid into him with a list of all this stuff he\u2019s done to me and his family so I think he blocked me but my phone is still on. \n\nIt\u2019s been a real hard time, I\u2019m glad my sister lives with me now. I get really sad randomly (like right now), I get really paranoid when my wife or sister have health problems because I\u2019m afraid they might actually be seriously ill (my mom initially had a bacterial infection in her colon), when my wife goes to see her doctor on the reservation (she is native so gets free healthcare) I make her text me updates about her drive because I\u2019m always paranoid she will wreck and die. When my wife wakes up and is walking to the bathroom or getting ready I get almost like flashbacks to my mom when she was sick. She just looked so tired all the time and hobbled around a lot (kinda like you do when you are really tired). I am worried that I am a marked person now, destined to have tragedy stalk me through life. Despite all this I think I\u2019m doing good sometimes like now I get like acute debilitating sadness and I just lay in bed for awhile. \n\nTL;DR : My mom died 7 months from cancer, we had a complicated relationship because of my dad who is an abusive alcoholic.

At the end\n\n\nSo here it is, me (33F) and my boyfriend (32m) come from 2 different countries and live in a 3rd one. We met one year ago and immediately clicked. He came to live with me withing a few days and we moved together to a very nice flat in December. \n\n\nHe was very depressed, had medication and managed to stay stable smoking a lot of weed. He has a long story of seeing psychiatrists, trying a lot of treatments since his childhood. He thought about it like an experiment they did on him because he was a turbulent child and his mom put him in a mental facility, which he thought was unfair. If I get it right, she had a lot to deal with. \nAnyway, I don't know much about his past. Just that he was ok when smoking and had very hard days when he had no weed. \n\n\nYesterday was a dry day. He was down, slept all day and could barely wake up. It's not unusual but I' m extra careful with him these days, trying to make things look better than usual. \nWe started a movie, but I didn't like it, we laughed, he even talked with some friends from his country about funny stuffs. He was ok. He hugged me, told me nice things, we said each other I love you and I went to bed. Nothing unusual. \n\n\nI found him hanged in the bathroom in the morning. I screamed, untangled him, slapped him, he was cold. The rest of the story is police coming, etc. \n\n\nI have few friends here, but they came through. Spent the day with me, took care of me awesomely. I'm ok with it, he was talking a lot about suicide, but I didn't expect him to do it for real, now that we were so happy. Not one fight in a year, we were independent and also very close. Supportive with each other, but never putting the weight of mental state on the other. He was incredibly patient and lovely. Everybody loves him. But still I'm not surprised really. I'm not angry at him and I don't feel guilty. I know it had nothing to do with us, he was sick and at a point he couldn't stand it I guess. \n\n\nMy question is, how do I cope? I have a lot of love and support, but I can't be with ppl all the time. I can't stay alone, I'm terrified. And I usually enjoy A LOT being alone with myself. Family and close friends are far, but their help through messages is awesome. Therapy is complicated because I don't speak the language here, and even in English it would be tough to find the words to communicate about such deep topic. And they give medicine like candy and I don't want that, I saw the effect it can have on someone fragile. Do you have tips that could help with the coming days? I will try to keep busy, I have a lot of administrative shit to take care of anyway. I know I can ask for help, and I will without any shame. I have the feeling I'm doing everything right for me right now. But I close my eyes and I see his dead face, his dead body on the floor, I hear the noise of him falling, I see my scarf hanging there.

Everyone thought (and still do) that we made such a great couple, we own a house together and have two pets etc, but for a long time I'd not felt much affection towards him, and I'm thinking this sudden loss last summer may be what caused me to finally make the big decision to break up, but I'm not really sure why. Is it normal to make drastic decisions while grieving? I would have thought in such a time, I'd have felt closer to him, but it was very much the opposite. I'm just wondering if this is just what grief is like and it's the first time I've properly felt it, or if I'm struggling?", "subreddit": "GriefSupport"}

I lost my mom back in February to aggressive thyroid cancer. I don't think the pain of losing my biggest and sole supporter, especially emotionally, has decreased in the slightest in the months since. I can't say if it will. Back in November my mom and dad visited me in college for lunch and she told me they found tumors around her ovaries. She'd been in and out of the hospital from an ongoing case of pain when eating. She told me not to worry as it was early on. Truthfully, I didn't worry. And because of this I was very ill prepared for the swift news that it was a matter of time. I watched her strength diminish and her ability to walk vanish, being left in her hospital bed we had at home. I still have the image of her staring into space, struggling to breath on the day she passed away. I visited home that day, saw her like that, told her I loved her with hope that she heard, and went upstairs to gather myself. Came back downstairs and she was gone. Dad said she was in that state earlier in the week which makes me believe she waited for me to be there before leaving us. Not all the memories are bad though. One time my aunts were visiting and I tagged along without telling my parents. The look on Mom's face when she saw me was pure happiness and just the best thing ever. Even with these good memories, I don't know how I'm gonna cope, because I don't ever want to go a day without thinking of her.

Long story short, my sister and I are close siblings. Whenever we have the chance to see each other we take it. She started dating this guy when I was twelve. Got to know him pretty well, but I never do/did see either of them too often because she went off to live a few hours away from me with him for college. Basically, over the past six years whenever I saw my sister I saw this guy, I was skeptical at first but grew to like him, and realized he was one of the nicest and funniest people I'd ever met. They ended up breaking up this past September because he actually had been drinking a bit too much for my sister's liking, and he had clinical depression from another whole set of things, which I never knew, and wasn't allowing my sister to help, or professionals. He killed himself a week or so ago from said problems. Even though they broke up, I continued to talk to him every month or two. I would just check in with him, ask him how he's doing or make a joke to him. The last thing we ever talked about, was him telling me to keep alcohol under control, because it just isn't worth it in any way. (I don't have a problem he was giving personal advice) I just feel so terrible about all of this, because I wanted the chance to know him as a friend, as something more than my sister's boyfriend. And I just hate how we left off. There's a million other things I wish I could've said to him. God, if I knew about the depression I would have texted him every damn day. And it might (definitely) sound crazy, but for some reason I want to believe that he's heard my thoughts. But at the same time I can't be sure, I've been having quite the debacle with religion, higher ups, that stuff.

I remember being small, playing in the warehouse, going fishing, camping, beach trips with him, playing hockey, woodworking, awesome christmases. Everything. \n\nHowever, due to some animosity on my mothers side, these visits were few and far between when I was little. It wasn\u2019t until her mother died that she truly forgave her father and sought a relationship with him, and by that time, I was already 16 or so, and naturally I was too concerned with chasing girls or smoking pot or whatever, and had no interest in visiting him much anymore other than obligatory holidays and phone calls periodically. \n\nFast forward to earlier this year. I\u2019m 24, established, engaged, and doing well. I take my fianc\u00e9e to meet him, we spend a day together. It was really nice. We made plans to go fishing again, he hugged my fianc\u00e9e, said she was truly beautiful, told me I\u2019ve grown into a fine man. Really nice stuff. However, our plans for the summer are cut short. Two weeks later, he has a stroke. He never really came back from it, over the course of the last few months, he suffered another one, which pretty much turned him to a vegetable. The last time I saw him was on Mother\u2019s Day. He was completely immobile, bed ridden and mostly paralyzed. I held his hand, told him I love him. He told me he loved me, although, I could barely understand him. I left, pretty down about it, but glad I saw him.\n\nYesterday my mother told me I should come see him, as it wouldn\u2019t be long now, he had worsened, but I just started a new job coaching martial arts (my dream job) last week and I didn\u2019t want to mess anything up, so I declined. \n\nTonight, I got the call. He\u2019s gone. Passed in his sleep. I don\u2019t feel anything. I\u2019m angry at myself. I could have held his hand one last time. I could have felt him, warm. Maybe not talked to him, but at least felt his presence. He\u2019s gone now, and I don\u2019t feel anything. Is this normal? We weren\u2019t incredibly close, but we definitely loved each other. We never had one disagreement, we always were pals. Now he\u2019s dead. What the fuck? Why can\u2019t I feel anything? Am I fucked in the head? I\u2019m sorry this post is so long, My fianc\u00e9e is asleep, and I\u2019m wired, no one to talk to. \n\nAnyways, if this even gets any responses, thanks in advance for taking the time to read.", "subreddit": "GriefSupport"}

In the span between mother's day and the anniversary of her passing, he just loses it for a few weeks.  I don't know how to help him at all.  On the first anniversary, he broke up with me and shut everyone out.  This time around, he is just picking fights over everything, no matter how trivial (last night he yelled at me for being emotional about the way Game of Thrones ended, for one example).  He won't talk about her or anything that is really bothering him.  His father was a very alpha male type, extremely hard on him.  His mother was the ideal nurturing and supportive mother.  She had her demons though.  She was a serious alcoholic.  She had cancer three times, beat it the first two times, and it looked like she was going to beat it again, and then suddenly she was just gone.  He sometimes goes down the rabbit hole of drinking like she did, but always pulls himself out of that.  But, basically, he just isn't dealing with anything and I feel helpless watching him suffer.  Is there ANYTHING a SO in my position can do to help him in this time?  Do I just have to watch him flail?", "subreddit": "GriefSupport"}

(she was dying of multiple organ failure).\n\nso the hospital nurses where irritated and said if we wont let them do anything for her to keep her alive we HAD to go within like 2 hrs. a family member overheard some nurses talking trash about us because they weren't able to do anything. (yes they got a good talking too).\n\nso, soon hospice came, and arranged to take her over. (the hospitals hospice building was right behind the hospital.) mom was readied to be moved. she was only in the hospital for about 4.5 days. that is how quickly she deteriorated.\n\nthen in hospice, they put a super loud oxygen machine on her...which was NOT apart of the plan. the machine was so loud we couldnt hear anything. they seemed annoyed because we had them remove it so mom could pass peacefully.\n\nin about an hour, mom had passed. i was holding her hand, and had this desperate need to feel her heartbeat in her wrist. when she passed, i lost it....bad...my sister, threatened to have be put in a hold for my mental state. because before mom went into the hospital, we had a massive argument...BIG. i threatened suicide. but then she ended up in the ER, so i did not go through it, despite, taking an overdose, 10pills? maybe more i dunno of my prozac. apparently it takes a much larger dose to kill you.\n\nbut...now it is just me and my dad in this house...and he is 88 this july....and, we all know elders usually follow their mates within months, to a yr. and i know for a FACT, my brain, my mental state will be unable to handle to losing my dad too. i snapped when mom died, and was barely pulled out of it....i wont be able to be pulled from it when he goes. and i do not want to end up living in a psych ward on suicide watch. so ive decided to end my own life when he goes.\n\nthis, may seem horribly selfish to some. but, i have no one. i have spent the last almost 10 yrs, taking care of mom and dad, and had surrendered to the fact this was my earthly purpose. and when they are gone....i will have none. i even put off having my own family. im 38.f. my family has been my life. but, my sister, is married, and has her husband to hold her up. my niece, whos 2 yrs older than me, has her own husband and kids, and live in another state.  they had me on a home suicide watch. they would not even let me sleep with my door closed after mom passed that day. i just cried and cried then cried myself to sleep clutching my moms favorite blanket.\n\ni still feel, almost numb, and shock. like, at some times, i will be ok, then its this painful overflow, it literally makes my entire body hurt, especially my heart. i heard it be called broken heart syndrome. some have even passed from grief from it. my brother, died in 96. that was horrible to go through.painful, for years, yes. but, the pain from losing my mom, is quite literally the worst pain ever. and there is no remedy for it. and if one more person tells me, \"it gets better with time\"...im going to lose it!  because not everyone, gets better over time...i know persons who have had something horrible happen to cause loved children to die, or mates, and its been 10+yrs and they still are not over it.\n\nfor a while i had Medicaid, but it lapsed and i am having hard time getting it back. my then therapist, knew i had suicidal tendencies. i wonder what they would think of me now. i dont know.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\ni am sorry this is so long...this is the first time ive ever told anyone about my plans...i think...i have told someone but i cannot remember if was a dream or not. my days, my night have no end. they all run together.", "subreddit": "GriefSupport"}

I remember right after you died I was pretty fucked up. I was younger (maturity wise and terrible with money), broke and all I wanted to do was get drunk so I could numb the disbelief and pain I felt trying to accept it. I scoured my entire house searching for every last coin I could find so I could go to coinstar and buy a bottle of wine. I got my wine and pretty much just laid in bed all day, dead to the world. \n\nThat night I had a dream, or something, I don\u2019t know what else to call it. You were slowly walking around my bedroom looking at things, touching some things, then you looked at me and sat down beside me on the bed, just staring into space. You put your hand on my leg and I could feel it. When I woke up, I was still just numb. Lifelessly stumbled to the bathroom and just sat there. My leg was itchy and so I pulled up my leggings to scratch, and when I did, a dime fell out and onto the floor. Right where you\u2019d put your hand on me in my dream. When I had absolutely no coins left in my house after the day before. \n\nI\u2019ve felt you around me since then from time to time and usually it\u2019s on bad days, then I find dimes in strange places almost like it\u2019s you telling me to smile. \n\nI hadn\u2019t seen you in my dreams. Not since then. I\u2019ve looked for you, sometimes even call out for you, but nothing. \n\nLast night, seeing you was like the greatest surprise I\u2019ve ever been given. I could feel you when you hugged me, I could hear your voice and hear you laugh and it was like you were standing right next to me. I was so happy.. my heart was so happy. The dream repeated itself. It was weird, like almost when I play it back in my head it\u2019s like a recording and parts of the dream are weird, like my parents are sitting there talking to us like they suddenly care about the way I feel about you. But because it repeated, I got to hug you twice and feel everything all over again, so maybe that\u2019s why it played twice. I don\u2019t really remember the ending of the dream, just that part. Your eyes. Your smile. Lit up, like you were really there. \n\nI woke up and now my heart hurts because you\u2019re still gone. I can\u2019t bring you back. I feel like you\u2019re out there somewhere and I just don\u2019t know how to get to you. \n\nI wish I could just stay there in the dream or back somewhere before everything, before you died, and just stay frozen in time. I miss you so much. \n\nI\u2019m glad I got to see you again. Maybe I\u2019ll try to go back to sleep and see if you come back haha. I know you won\u2019t though.

But it was so much fun to leave work, pack quickly, and head out and then be on the beach....to get out of our town, with not a care in the world.\n\nNow, I'm crying at work because I just realized that I can't do it, because I have 3 dogs. My mom was always dependable and all it took was a call, and she never minded watching our dogs for my husband and I's impulse trips.

Always doing, oats for breakfast every morning, always taking care of his family. He was a very healthy man, he would take our dog out for a walk almost every morning without fail after he fell in love with her. He loved walking too. At 72 he walked the alps with his friends who would travel all over to venture together. There really wasn't anything he couldn't do until he started getting ill a couple of years a go.\n He had a kidney failure that was so bad he should have died, but he was walking around as if nothing had happened until my grandma realised something was wrong. He had a catheter for a while and the doctors thought he might have had a stroke because his mental ability and eyesight began quickly declining from there on. As time passed the dementia got slowly worse and we found out he had prostate cancer that also spread to his bones. At his age there was only so much doctors could do, and eventually he mostly stopped treatment because getting him to hospital was too difficult. He then became bed bound and was being cared for by my mom and grandma.\nIn February of this year his health declined very quickly, so I took 2 weeks out of university to visit home. It completely broke me the first time I saw him laying there- I've never seen a person dying before and the last time I'd seen him he was sat up in bed, just very vaguely understanding what I was saying as we listened to \"what a beautiful world\". It was such a shock. He was also still experiencing pain in his legs from the bone cancer prior to being given proper pain relief, so often his eyes would widen in  pain and fear with his whole body shaking. You could tell from his expression that he was asking for help, but he couldn't speak. Once things had calmed we knew we would only have a few days left. We took it in turns to sit with his, holding his hand so he didn't feel alone.\nOne night i sat with him for a few hours, very quietly reading. Me and my mom realised how quiet his breath had become so gathered my sister into the room. Just as he took his last breath, my grandma managed to come in and tell him that it was okay to let go. It was painful but almost relieving in that we knew his suffering was over.\nWe held his funeral the week after and I travelled back to university the following day as there was so much to catch up on- but looking back I feel like I needed time to really grieve. One of the things I'm struggling with the most is that because he was ill for so long I'm finding it so hard to remember who my grandad was when he was well. I obviously have memories but they are so faded that it's hard to bring them back. I feel like I lost my connection with him when he forgot who I was, because sometimes he felt like a complete stranger when his dementia was bad. I feel really guilty as well that I've been away at university and couldn't spend more time with him over the past year- even though I know that's what he would have wanted.\nAs a counselling student I know that the grief doesn't really pass with time, you just feel the pain less frequently and learn to cope with that pain. It's just hard because I can't find that connection - the thing to really hold on to his memory.\nI had a dream about him not long a go and I like to think that it was him visiting me. We were happy and laughing in the dream and I think that's how he would have wanted to be remembered. As the man who lit up every room with his silly jokes and big BFG ears.\nI just wanted to share because it would be nice to hear from people who are or have been coping with grief after experiencing some form of anticipatory grief/the death of a loved one that was quite traumatic.", "subreddit": "GriefSupport"}

{"post_id": "btha5b", "created_utc": 1558928971, "title": "help overcoming loneliness", "author": "[deleted]", "self_text": "Hello, I am a 21 year old girl and my boyfriend whom I had been with for four years just died three months ago. He was supposed to pick me up from work one night but didn't respond to my texts, so I ended up walking home. It was the night after we had this crazy snowstorm in Minnesota with a shit ton of snow and negative temps. Anyways I walked home and I found him laying facedown in the snow, dead. It was pretty gruesome, I suppose the cold temperatures didn't help either. Anyways that was horribly traumatizing, I didn't know how or why this happened. when the police came we went inside my home (we had been living together for the past two years) and they saw some kind of drugs on tin foil. I had never used drugs and I had never seen my late boyfriend use any either, before I met him he told me he used to use drugs (heroin) but he said he was sober for a year. And I belived him, throughout the relationship I never saw any drug use or signs. After the mortician looked at his body he found out that he had indeed been clean, (he could tell from his organs). So it's not like I could've prevented this from happening.  But for whatever reason he chose to try it again when I was away at work, and it had fetanyl in it and he died. And although I had given him rent money and he said he had paid it, it turns out he didn't and I had to leave my home within four days of his passing. I couldn't afford the bills on my own, so I had to leave behind my home my friends my job his family. To move back with my parents. (Side story) my parents were physically and mentally abusive really bad towards themselves and me when I was living there, that's part of the reason I moved out of home so early with my late boyfriend. And although there's no physical violence anymore it's still not an ideal situation. So that's stressful as well, and it seems I have no one to talk to about this. My friends leave me on read and cancel plans, I've been left on read from my boyfriends family members, even a girl who I knew whose boyfriend died asked me how I was doing, and when I replied was just left on read. I have a job interview on Wednesday so I'm hoping I'll make friends at work but it's so discouraging. I'm so freaking lonely, I feel ashamed to talk about my grief because people diminish it as his fault or less worthy of mourning as compared to a car accident or similar death. Like because he died that way I shouldn't talk about it is the vibe I'm getting from most everyone. Either they ignore me and brush it off with a yeah drugs are bad or with assuming he was a druggy the whole time ugh. Like you wouldn't say oh yeah shit happens to someone who's loved one died of cancer why be so insensitive to me??.  I had no doubt in my soul that I was going to marry him, he made me so happy and it truly was a perfect relationship. Respectful and caring in every way. I'm afraid no one will want anything to do with me now. like will people not want to become involved with me because of the stigma that's associated with the drug, will they think I knew and it's my fault, will a guy see me as too much emotional baggage because of my grief? I don't want to bother any of my few friends anymore (I've been left on read a couple times in a row now) so I'm asking strangers for guidance. Oh and I have severe depression and anxiety, it was nearly gone before the accident happened but now it's pretty bad. but I'm not like moody and sad all the time, I can be very happy and carefree when in public as to not be a buzzkill or worry friends, and I am happy most of the time now. It's just social rejection and pressure from others to move on is getting to me. I pray that things will get better but when your mind is clouded with grief and despair it's pretty hard to imagine a way to improve your life. So if anyone has any tips to become more social or anyways to help cope with these feelings it would be much appreciated. Thank you for your time.", "subreddit": "GriefSupport"}

He was shot MULTIPLE MULTIPLE MULTIPLE TIMES....by his \"friend\". It is still under investigation so I can't give many details. The story from the only witness keeps changing. My s.o. was unarmed, and shot in point blank range, until the investigation is over I won't be giving exact numbers, but he was shot several times, a large amount of gunshot wounds, the more the paramedics and doctors and nurses looked the more they found. He had no pulse by the time paramedics arrived..the man who murdered my life partner, our 4 year old sons \"superman\", is only facing 2nd degree murder charges. He stood next to his body until the police arrived. He took his life from him, from me, from our son, from his parents and sisters and other family..BECAUSE OF A CELLPHONE. The story has changed several times from the only witness ( 3 of them were \"friends\") but it is for sure it was over my s.o. cellphone. \n\nI was in complete denial the first week, by the time the hospital called me (he came in as an unidentified John doe) the medical examiner had already taken his body to the morgue. I had no idea until 4 hours after he was shot and died on the scene. He was 1 1/2 away, so 6 hours after he died I got to the hospital, for some reason they gave me no information over the phone about his condition. I was on the emergency contact list and had his permission in his paperwork on file to be able to call about records, appointments, etc.\n\nThey told me he was shot and killed. I asked where, their faces let me know it wasnt just \"where he was shot\" so I asked how many times, they were hesitant to give a number and just kept saying multiple times I cant remember much conversation between them but I remember one of them finally looking at the chart and the look on their face before the number was spoken was told me it was an insane #...then I was told and I dont remember anything else except for the only witness calling and asking if I could get his phone off his dead body, his phone, wallet, clothes, and jewelry had already been taken in as evidence. \n\nI was in denial truly and honestly believed it wasnt MY person they were talking about. I called his phone and the hospital and the morgue 100s and 100s of times. I was mad at him for not showing up I was mad at all these friends and family and people who kept telling me they were so sorry. I was mad that I was planning a funeral for someone I truly thought was no one we knew and mad at people for being so dramatic. I never showed my anger out loud, people knew though.  Our son was sitting with me when I got the phone call he knew something was wrong and I told him as soon as I was told. I read online, talked to several different funeral directors, and preachers, and people who have gone through what we were going through to get advice on what to tell our son, if he should or shouldn't go etc..after we had the conversation he took a day or so before he said anything and told me he wanted to help make sure daddy knows how much he was loved. He wanted to help with the arrangements and I made sure he understood and everyone else understood that HE is in charge of his comfort zone right now if he says no do not try to convince or push him anyway. No is no. He did very well, when he had enough he simply said okay mama I'm done and that was it. I prepared him but didnt prepare myself for it to really be him\n\n I thought the funeral (Sunday may 19th) would help. I opened the door  and could see his hat and forehead and couldn't breath I closed the door to the church and went outside to gather myself and still was like he is not the only person with that fucking hat how rude of them to put one on this guy so i walked inside and when i was able to see his face and his hands and him I couldn't breathe  I couldn't stand up I think I screamed not like scared kinda scream but like holy fuck my heart is being ripped out kinda scream and all I could say is fuck and then I got light headed and threw up from the pain there was literal pain all over my body. When I made it up to the casket my heart was in pieces I was shaking so much I fixed his eyebrows he woulda killed me if I didnt and I stood there for 2 hours not crying just standing and holding his hand trying to make sure I remembered every detail about him. And i cried when they told me i needed to let his hand go that they needed to close the casket it was time to take him to the cemetery. I watched our son help lower his casket into the plot I bought that wasnt for a stranger. And I went numb after that. I haven't felt shit.\n\nI cant sleep on a normal schedule or more than a few hours, I cant eat. And I cant cry..my brain knows I'm sad and knows im angry. I cant handle a lot of people around me or a lot of talking or anything really. My friends and family are trying their best to be supportive but have no idea how to help or how I feel they've never lost someone that played the role he did in my life, due to being murdered. He was 24, I'm 23. We have a 4 year old and planned to spend the rest of our life together. We wanted more babies, we were in love, he was my best friend, my support, my go to, my number one fan, my encourager, my other half, the father to our son. And it was all put to a sudden, abrupt, stop by the hands of someone else..over a cellphone.\n\nI need advice. Support. Anything. I'm lost and confused and currently readjusting to what my new life will be like. *I am asked by friends and family a lot after this so just to answer this now. I am not suicidal have no thoughts of hurting myself or others, just sad and confused and lost*", "subreddit": "GriefSupport"}

The other day I found out that a close friend from high school (who was also my first boyfriend, the first person I ever had sex with, and  after breaking up came out as transgender). I can go into unpacking that if anyone has questions but I\u2019m posting here for support. I feel like her death is the icing on the shit show cake for my life. She committed suicide, no one has been officially told but the funeral was today and there was no casket or any viewing of any kind. At the alter was a table with her picture, an Xbox controller, collectible figure and a few other items. The funeral is one of the many things that hurts me and the rest of us who knew who \u201cJared\u201d really was. Jared, as I mentioned before came out as transgender in high school after we dated. That\u2019s when \u201cJared\u201d became Jocelyn and she made it clear he was now she. She was only out to people close to her but I know she eventually wanted to fully transition. After high school life got to Jocelyn and she was struggling with mental illness and in school. I know at some point she also went to a psych hospital to get help, and was doing better we thought. We weren\u2019t as close as we used to be but when I started working at the mall in our hometown, I ran into her also working at the mall. We\u2019d talk whenever I\u2019d go on break but I kept my distance because I knew she had a bit of a drug problem. Not addiction but I knew she could get really irresponsible when it came to dangerous drugs. I\u2019m upset at myself because the last time we talked i didn\u2019t think to ask if she was doing okay and needed anything. I know her parents weren\u2019t very accepting of her being transgender. So much that at her funeral, Jocelyn didn\u2019t exist. The funeral service was held in a chapel. Led by a preacher, and gospels were played. I understand that there are traditions and customs but not much of the funeral really reflected who We really lost. Her best friend spoke but stayed clear of mentioning anything too personal out of respect for the family but her parents did not speak. Her sister cried the entire funeral, and not just tears, she had two people helping her walk she was so devastated. The songs that were played were country gospels, even though Jocelyn was openly against Christianity and organized religion.

My aunt is my sun and moon. I stupidly thought she\u2019d be the last to go and I would have her to help me navigate the death of one or both of my parents. She told me today that her cancer is back and she chooses not to fight it this time (round three). I respect her decision, but  my brain broke. I had a plan. I had an approach arranged. My plan? She\u2019d be there for me as my parents fell apart. I got complacent. I\u2019ve been so busy grieving my dad I forgot to spend good time with my aunt. Now she\u2019s going to go, my dad is almost gone. My mom is remains. I love her, but she is by far my most complicated relationship I have. I played it all wrong. I laid bets on who would go when, I set myself up for a plan that isn\u2019t going to happen. It all just hurts. \n\nThe boyfriend responded to all this with \u201cI may be dying too, like your aunt, everyone is.\u201d I just wanted to scream at him. We currently aren\u2019t talking because he couldn\u2019t agree to disagree. I thought he what he said was insensitive, but I didn\u2019t ask for an apology and I let it go. But he couldn\u2019t accept the fact that I found it kinda abrasive, what he said. We\u2019d almost reached a truce and then I stupidly said I was sad we hadn\u2019t spend more time with my aunt. He took that as criticism (again making it about himself) and stomped off, firmly on the moral high ground. So my whole world is on fire. And the one guy I have as support is kinda a jerk. I\u2019d never treat his grief like that. I know because our roles have been reversed. I believe in listening to the grieving.

I\u2019ll be tangled up in wondering why I didn\u2019t do xyz with my aunt, dad, mom. I\u2019ll be forever second guessing myself. I\u2019ll be forever missing them. I moved states thinking they\u2019d all be gone in six months after I got here. That\u2019s why I moved. I\u2019ve been a care taker for three years, with a small life. Keeping it small and still didn\u2019t spend time with the one who will go first. I got complacent. But I\u2019ve also realized I stopped living because I\u2019ve been bracing for their deaths.

All because he's gone. \n\nBecause I couldn't do more, because of my parents breaking up, because of his own hardheadedness He's gone.

I feel empty, incomplete and I haven't had time to rebuild myself, because its been a domino of shit storm after shit storm since he's been gone. \n\nif I could take everything I ever said mean months prior, if I could redo that morning over to give him a proper \"I love you\" before I left, I would. \n\nI would give anything in this world to have my father's hugs again, to hear his laugh and taste his cooking.

Now I can't even look at our favorite movies, songs or bands without wanting to break down and sob.\n\nAnd nothing is getting better, no matter how many times people say \"it'll get better\" it doesn't. It keeps hurting and aching and all I want is him. \n\nI wish I could say I did all I could but I feel guilty of failing him, I failed him, I could've done more but chose to rot in my own selfishness. \n\nAll I could ever wish for now, was him.

Upon arrival A essentially threatened that he wouldn\u2019t be my friend if i didn\u2019t do \u2018cool\u2019 things.

B wanted the two of us to get along but eventually A snapped and lashed out at him. He said he didnt care and i believed him. He seemed to still be optimistic and tenacious as he always was. But two months later I found out that on the night of January 30th b killed himself. I miss him so much and every day i think about him.

Fast forward to last Friday night. It was guys night and Ethan and his buddies went out for drinks. Having only been 21 for a few weeks this was a normal Friday. Go and find a bar and argue over who the DD was. Ethan was almost it but he argued his way out over the phone before he left... it could\u2019ve saved his life, because he would\u2019ve had to take the truck.

I felt relieved when he said he was doing good because I had always comforted myself with the thought \u201che\u2019s not dead he\u2019s not sick he\u2019s just going back to get a job\u201d. But now he really is dead :(. 3 days later I got a call from my friend saying that he had killed himself and there was no note or anything. His family thought we would have the answers but we thought they would.  It was so surreal to me and strange being at the wake because it was like everyone there was connected by him but it was all just one big question mark.  My friends and I met his family and they were so amazingly kind just like he was.  Idk I thought I was doing better but I haven\u2019t been able to stop thinking about him even though, thankfully, I was able to say my goodbyes at the wake and funeral.  I think the biggest part that messes with me is that he had future plans, he was so excited to come visit my friends and I this summer, and most suicidal people don\u2019t talk about future plans.  And i know it\u2019s not my fault but I still wonder like \u201cwhat if I had just kept that conversation going for a few more days?\u201d \u201cwhat if I had sat down and called him on the phone to see if he was actually good like he said was\u201d? He was genuinely one of the nicest people I\u2019ve ever met in my life.  He NEVER had a problem with anyone, never spoke bad about anyone, LOVED his family and friends, super humble and kind to anyone he met.  At the wake, his lovely mother had asked his friends and I what was our favorite and least favorite thing about him and I genuinely could not even think of something I disliked about him.  And now he\u2019s just gone and I still find myself crying wondering about him.  Some of my other friends who were close to him don\u2019t seem as emotional about it anymore so I guess I\u2019ve had trouble getting these feelings out to people who understand. And by the way, I luckily do have a therapist who I love and I talked to her about it.  This experience has made me so much more aware of how I treat people and in his honor I try to treat everyone with the upmost kindness that he radiated while he was here. But I guess I just feel lost.

I have dogs now, not cats, although my main squeeze kitty lives in my bedroom, because I have a pitbull and 2 boxers, and all are prey driven. My live is a mystery, even to myself.  I've lost quite a few friends and family members due to money. My life is a mess of my own making, and I'm losing it. With him, my life was own as well as his. Now, I dont know.
