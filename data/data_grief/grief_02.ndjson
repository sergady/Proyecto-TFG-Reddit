Ive done everything to make her comfortable through this sad process. In the comments, some girl told her similar story. Everything she said is happening to us. Pushing away her boyfriend, isolating herself, etc. Her story ended with them breaking up. Now I am so scared of that because she is truly the love of my life. \n\nThings are also complicated because she has been away for 3 weeks now. We usually would talk all the time and make the best of the times shes away (happens a lot). I wont say her name, but these past 3 weeks she has been getting a lot of attention and could be regarded by some as \u201cfamous\u201d. Im so happy for her because she has done great things that have helped her tremendously during her grief. \n\nHowever, she barely talks to me anymore and the last call we had (few minutes ago), she said she wished she didnt have a boyfriend because she wouldnt have to take care of me during her grief and things would be easier. \nShe also said she didnt wanna see me at the airport (this weekend). \n\nI dont know what Im asking here, I just wanted to share this. I will keep trying to help her and go through this together, hopefully keeping our relationship intact. I am sorry to those who are offended that I am making this post about me, and not about the victim of a deceased relative. I actually make everything about her since the death of her father, I just don\u2019t want to bring up my feelings to her, because when I have, it made it worse.

I was always socially awkward and disliked for that growing up, but she always was my friend no matter how wierd I was. \nWe went through all of our dumb kid phases together, as long as it's been I still remember being at recess with her and having a \"rock family\" that we lined up rocks we found and checked on them every recess.\nThrough middle school, we went through the emo kid phase together. Everyone judged us and thought we were so lame, but we thought we were the shit.\nI've know this girl for the majority of my life. She was my sister. And now she's gone. \nShe was my rock even through adult hood. Whenever I needed someone to cry to or runaway to about some dumb trivial shit over a guy, she was the one I needed. Whenever I thought about taking my own life, she was there to remind me how important I am to her life. She made me feel loved and beautiful when I felt worthless and ugly.\nAnd I couldn't do the same for her. They say you shouldn't blame yourself, but I feel like I've truly failed her.\nOn last Monday at about 2 in the morning, drunk and impulsive, she hung herself. The ambulance made her heart beat come back, but no one knows how long she was going without oxygen. By the time they got there her fingers and lips were starting to turn blue. She was life flighted to the hospital I'm staying near right now.\nThe next morning, I drove 4 hours to come see her, a fucking mess. Her family and boyfriend had  so much hope she was going to come through, but as soon as I knew she was on life support and had a feeding tube in, I knew the worst was likely to happen. \nI tried my best to keep hope until last night when the neurologists briefed us that her MRI came back very negative. She has sever brain damage, and what made her herself is no longer there. Her body is being forced to breathe, but she is not there.\nThey are removing life support tomorrow, but I chose today to be the last day I see her. She s retaining so much water that her hands are severely swollen, and when she slightly opens her eyes all I see were what used to be her gorgeous hazel eyes laid a lifeless look staring back at me. I've failed my best friend in the entire world.\nHer parents have decided to plant her as a willow tree in Texas where she was born and at her happiest moments. There will be no funeral, because the last thing she wants is for people to be sobbing over her.\nHer mom wants me to plan a memorial or celebration of life for her. I don't know where to start. I don't know who is worth being notified of what happened. She was an antisocial person like me, so I was truly the closest friend to her. And she was the same for me.\nHow do I plan something like this? How do I even begin? I don't want it to be a sob fest over her, I just want a group of people who loved her the most to share their best memories about her. I just can't think of how to even deal with this.\nThe night I found out what happened, I had a dream that when I went to see her she woke up and we ran out of the hospital and moved to the coastline like we always wanted. Now I only have dreams of what she looks like on her hospital bed, lifeless. I can't handle this grief.

Who murders someone and gets 15 years. Even though the DA let me know what was going to happen and even asked what punishment I'd be okay with.  Honestly I didn't think he'd accept the deal. I feel like I got hit by a truck. I thought I could live with 15 years and 2 felonies and not having to go through the appeal process. But now that it's done I don't think I can. I think I jumped at the deal because I was scared the DA didn't have a strong case and there wouldn't be any justice for him. It was a crazy situation, drugs and robbery. But maybe I should have fought harder, maybe I just rushed to get closure. Because this whole shit is too painful to keep going through, endless court dates and phone calls with officials.

Every time I think about it, I wind up in a place where I want to end my life. January was an especially tough time. There hasn't been a week where I haven't broken down crying about it all at least once. I'm in therapy and have spoken to one past therapist about this, but they didn't really have anything helpful to say. They were pretty dismissive. Because of that, i've been really hesitant to bring it up to my current therapist.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShak was the first cat I killed. At the time, he'd been a stray in my neighborhood for a long time. I remembered his mother and his siblings, who all passed away. He was the only one left, an un-neutered male. My city doesn't have any neuter/release programs and the shelter is known for its high kill rate. The two non-profits are completely overwhelmed and haven't taken in cats in years. A family member of mine has trouble with the law and had already received one ticket for feeding strays. A neighbor called animal control on them a second time and they showed up, ready to ticket her again. They insisted on checking our house for cats and we allowed them. There they found my family's three cats, only two of whom were neutered. They were indoor only and we'd had them for over 10 years but my city had passed a law that required mandatory neutering and rabies shots. I was scared. When Shak came up to me I panicked and initially thought of hiding him in our home. But when the officer confronted me about the strays, I lifted him up and gave them to him. I regretted this instantly. I went to the shelter to ask for them to give him back to me. They told me he was very ill and would not live a good life on the streets. I wanted to believe them, but i'm not sure I did. They put him down. I can still see the photo of him the shelter took, which is how I tracked him down. There was so much fear in his eyes. I betrayed him. I don't think i deserve to live after I literally handed him away to die. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMerlin was my youngest cat. When the whole rabies thing happened, we were already getting ready to do some dental work for him. Animal control gave us a week to comply with the neuter and rabies law. I rushed him to the vet, where his brother was coincidentally already being neutered and having tooth surgery done. He was scared. They gave him the shot, but also offered to give him sub-q fluids as he was dehydrated. Shortly after, he developed FIP (not FIV, FIP.) He passed away from this. I wonder if it was truly the stress of anesthesia and surgery that made it happen, or if it was a contaminated needle from the sub-qs. I'll never know.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nPuss is the one I feel most guilty about, after Shak. When we took him off the streets, he already had herpes. He had constant upper respiratory infections. I would take him to the humane society often for antibiotics but the infections would always come back two or so weeks later. Eventually, time, laziness, money all made it so that we stopped taking him. He was okay for a long time, but one day I looked at him and realized he was so so skinny. We took him to the vet, where they gave us little hope for recovery. He had asthma and had developed scar tissue from the years of infection. For a year we treated him and he recovered beautifully. He gained weight, he got steroid treatments to stave off the breathing issues. But he still had a lot of dental work. One day he developed a strange wheeze to his breathing. We took him to a specialist who said his nasal passages were collapsing. They also discovered he badly needed dental work and that he had an inner ear infection. The cost of surgery was around 7k and we paid it. However, after the surgery they wanted to keep him overnight. We couldn't afford this. They did it for free, but did not give him fluids or medicine. After he went home, he failed to thrive. He stopped going to the bathroom and we took him to our local vet for an enema. Two days later he began to wheeze and seemed dizzy. I called the vet and they told me to give him a small dose of a human medicine. But by the time we got home, it was clear he was dying. I called his regular vet in the hopes that she'd come and put him to sleep at home. But she refused saying she was too busy. I called an at-home euthanasia service but they didn't arrive in time. I tried CPR for a brief period, and sometimes wonder if - had i tried longer, he would have survived. He died in our arms, gasping for air. This was only 3 months after Merlin passed.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShiro was the oldest, but the last to pass away. When we adopted him he had been a stray whom a neighbor had taken to the shelter. We'd grown so fond of him that we went and paid the $150 fee to adopt him. For a long time he was okay. Then we noticed he was pawing at his mouth. It turned out he had stomatitis and needed his molars removed. We agreed to do this. Once that surgery was over, the vet added that he had a heart condition. After we paid for them to diagnose that, they mentioned that he also had diabetes. Years later, we realized that the vet had also made note that he was developing chronic kidney disease, but they never told us. It was around the time of the diabetes issue that we realized they were gouging us. They insisted that we had to bring him in daily for them to monitor his blood sugar. Of course, you can do this at home yourself. We switched vets. Eventually he developed stomatitis again and we took out all his teeth. This didn't hinder his life at all. Subsequently, our new vet told us that his heart had to be monitored. We would pay $300 every 9 months for a cardiologist to come and check on his heart. Around the same time as Merlin passed away, he was diagnosed with chronic kidney failure. The treatment (sub-q fluids) is contraindicated with cardiomyopathy but we knew that the kidney disease was a bigger risk than the heart. We treated him and for YEARS he did well. One day he woke up wheezing. We took him to the ER where they told us his cardiomyopathy had finally developed into congestive heart failure. The treatment for congestive heart failure would ravage his kidneys. We made the call to take him home and have him put to sleep that day. They gave us diuretics to keep him comfortable. He had the best day ever at home. But, when the euthanasia vet finally arrived ... it was like he knew. He hid under the table. Eventually, I felt as if the vet was annoyed by how long we were taking. I took him out from that table and held him as she gave him the sedative. With Merlin, the sedative had taken some time to work. As such, I was talking to the vet when he walked away and laid down by his favorite spot near the sunny door. By the time I realized he was falling asleep, it was too late. I walked over and whispered goodbye and told him I loved him. They shaved his arm and euthanized him. I don't know if he ever heard me say goodbye.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI wasn't doing anything today. But all of a sudden I reminded myself that i'm a murderer. I killed Shak. I killed Merlin. I killed Puss. I didn't say goodbye to Shiro. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI've posted on r/Depression and r/Petloss before. I got a kind message from one individual but I feel like I've taken advantage of their patience. I have depression and anxiety, as well as bipolar II. I've been in therapy for 15 years and am well-medicated. However, nothing can help this grief and guilt I feel. I know I did terrible things. I was a bad person. I was pure evil with Shak. I was lazy with Puss. I was cruel with Shiro. I don't know what to do. I can't forgive myself. I don't expect anyone else to either. I don't know why i'm even posting this other than the need to tell someone what a bad person I am. I don't deserve forgiveness or sympathy. I just wish I could make it all up to them somehow. I wish so many things. But there's nothing to be done about any of it now. ", "subreddit": "GriefSupport"}

My dad has been in a coma for 3 weeks. Turns out that he actually fell into a coma on my birthday. He lives in Arizona and I live in Tennessee closer to my mom while I am attending college. Out of the people who knew about my dad being in a coma, no one decided it was important enough to tell me. 3 weeks not knowing that he was in a coma, 3 weeks I could've had the chance to tell him goodbye. I recently was on our insurance claim search to see what doctors that were in-network for me because I needed something done; anyways I saw that he had so many xrays done and was curious as to what was wrong with him and for some reason I never asked. We had always had a close relationship when I was younger and when I moved to Tennessee we kind of drifted apart. So I would text him and he wouldn't always reply so that wasn't out of the ordinary but I texted him Jan 16 to say hello, another time Jan 24 to say hello again, and the last message I had sent to him was asking why he couldn't take 5 seconds out of his day to say hi back. I was kind of upset with him cause at that point it seemed like he didn't want any contact but during that time he was in a coma, and no one had told me. I am mad that those could've been the last words he read from me but I am thankful that it is not. Being his daughter, I still can't fathom that no one wanted me to know. I was at work when my brother asked me to meet him at my mother's house which was unusual but I said okay. It worried me even more because I had seen those XRays and knew something was wrong with my father. So I broke down a little to my manager to let me go early to go find out what was wrong and I left to go to my mom's house. On the way there, everything that could be wrong with my dad like cancer, or being in the hospital for high blood pressure circled through my mind. Death was not one of those occurrences that I thought could happen. I received the news that he had been in a coma for 3 weeks and then finally that he actually passed away. I sat there on my mother's couch, crying, screaming NO that this couldn't be real. My father could not have passed away. I cried and am still crying. I get these moments where I am alright and that I did not just receive the worst news of my life, but then it comes to me again and I start panicking again. I just keep hoping that I wake up from a dream and my dad is alright. My life doesn't seem to make sense anymore that I actually lost one of my parents. I haven't seen my dad in 3 years but I did talk to him recently. I was looking through his facebook because it's not real that he's gone still, and his last facebook post was him wishing me a happy birthday; not knowing it would be the last one he would wish me. I keep getting messages and texts saying that they're sorry for my loss and it hits me even harder that he's not here. My cousin messaged me saying he said goodbye for me, and that frustrates me because I wanted to say goodbye, I wanted to give my dad a kiss and a hug, I wanted to talk to him to tell him how much I loved him. I wanted all of those moments to myself to let him know I will always love him, but I never got the chance. It just makes me sick that I wasn't able to say goodbye because I was in the dark. My whole family is concerned about me the most cause no one could predict how I would take the news and I still don't think its real. Everything now feels like a dream because I don't even physically feel alive anymore. My dad was everything to me and now there's so many moments in life that I am going to break down because I cannot tell him about or experience with him.

Maybe posting this will help clear up my mind a bit.\n\nMy friend of 23 years passed away about 2-3 weeks ago. My mom found out through a friend and just advised me a few hours ago. I am heartbroken. I don\u2019t have any details other than he passed away. If it\u2019s ok, I\u2019m going to type out our story and hopefully that will help me out a bit.\n\nWhen I was about 4 or 5 years old, my two younger brothers and I found out that we were going to have a new guest stay will us for awhile. Years later, I found out that my parents were having financial difficulties after my late grandmother\u2019s funeral arrangements and decided to rent out a spare room we had. That\u2019s when I first met my friend G (I will refer him as that). \nG was only supposed to stay with us until my parents were financially stable but he ended up living with us for about 23 years. \n\nHe was a great man. There\u2019s so many good memories. We would walk everywhere since he didn\u2019t have a car. He would tell us stories of his childhood while going for these walks. He would take us to the movie theater and afterwards, go and eat at Burger King. Whenever he needed to go to the store, he would invite us, and let us choose one item we wanted. He was always interested in our daily lives. When my parents weren\u2019t available, he would help us with our school projects. He never needed to buy us anything or help us but insisted. I remember once we stated getting older, he loved that my youngest brother and I were getting into older rock bands (like CCR and the Beatles) and let us borrow anything in his CD collection to help us discover more music. He never had kids so I like to believe we were like his kids to him. We grew up with him.\n\nI\u2019d considered him like family. I have a lot of distant family but he had more meaning in my life than any of them. Birthdays, graduations, parties, etc, he was there. Even when my parents didn\u2019t always necessarily agree with my views, he always told me that I should always stand up for what I believed in (that was his way of thinking since he was kicked out of his parents house when he was a teenager since he refused to cut his long hair). \n\nFast forward into my mid-20s and I noticed that he wasn\u2019t looking so well. He did state that he was always feeling tired but thought it was the blue collar job he had recently gotten (he would\u2019ve been in his late 50s and tough for him). After dropping him off a few times at a construction site on my way to work, I noticed he looked worse and worse. But he was stubborn. Only when he was feeling completely ill, he finally visited the doctor to find out he had cancer. \n\nHe went through cancer treatment and stayed at the hospital for several weeks. Apparently, he would always complain that he just wanted to go home. I do remember when I first went to visit him at the hospital with my parents, we ran into his family downstairs. He didn\u2019t get along very well with his siblings but loved his nephews and nieces. His sister wanted to let my parents how happy she was that we (meaning my brothers and myself) also came to visit. My youngest brother came to visit earlier in the week and she stated that he immediately got happy and attentive. He hadn\u2019t been like that since he was admitted. He had the same response when he saw me too. I, in the other hand, was completely heartbroken. Seeing him weak and helpless in bed wrecked me. I\u2019ve never experienced anything like that. While he was going through his treatments, whenever I had time to myself, I would just burst out crying. \n\nGood news came though, he was later discharged few weeks later. He still had to check in to finish the rest of his chemotherapy but he was happy to be home. Every once in awhile, a nurse would come and visit to see how he was doing but that annoyed him so they stopped the home visits. Then we got the more good news, he was cancer free. Months and months of treatment, but he was free. I can\u2019t even express how I felt when I heard the news. He wasn't 100% back to his normal self but he was better.\n\nUnfortunately, 23 years living with us wasn\u2019t always peachy. As a roommate, he definitely stepped over the boundaries one too many times. He had gotten too comfortable. My mom would talk to him but like I said, he was stubborn. Many little things over the years added up and I completely understood my mom. She wanted him to move out but my dad didn\u2019t say anything. My dad would just say that he lived too many years with us and G would change if we would remind of the rules. That never changed. Unfortunately for my parents, when they were planning to advise that maybe he should start looking somewhere else to live, he was diagnosed with cancer. So that plan was put on the back burner. \n\nHe lived with us for about a year after he was cancer free, but he wasn\u2019t all mentally there. As time went on, too many little accidents were occurring like leaving the gas on the stove top. Leaving the iron plug in. He needed to be in a home with staff. Since his sister was taking care of him financially while he recovered, my parents talked to both of them and explained why it was time for him to move out. He hated the idea of having a nurse come help with daily tasks so the sister did agree that he would have to move out since it was a risk. My parents gave her 3 months to find a place for him. That got pushed to 4 months, but he did end moving out without notifying anyone.\n\nHe moved out with the help of his family. None of us knew he was moving that Saturday morning. My parents where our running errands that morning and never got to say goodbye to him. I know he wasn\u2019t happy with my parents for asking him to leave. My youngest brother and I were in the living room when he came and spoke to us for the last time. He spoke with my youngest brother first. Then he spoke to me. He said, \u201ctell (other brother) I said bye. Just because I am moving out doesn\u2019t mean goodbye. We will still stay in touch, ok?\u201d That was the last time I spoke/saw him again. \n\nWe had his cell phone number but it belong to someone else when we tried to reach out. No social media for him since he wasn\u2019t tech savvy. We don\u2019t know where any of his family members live so all communication was gone on our end.  \n\nSix months later, he was dead. All I know is that it occurred in the beginning of January. And I found out a hours ago from my mom from a friend of a friend. I\u2019m angry that his family didn\u2019t even call us that he was worse or even passed away. I\u2019m heart broken wondering how he died. I know that if he was in the hospital, he would\u2019ve wanted my brothers and I to visit him. I don\u2019t know if he was wasn\u2019t able to communicate or what but I hope he wasn\u2019t lonely and sad. We would\u2019ve been there for him. I just picture him how he was at the hospital before he recognized me and it fucking kills me. \n\nI\u2019m sorry G. I wish things would\u2019ve ended differently.", "subreddit": "GriefSupport"}

Knowing that one of these coming up days will be my last is really affecting me. I don\u2019t feel like I can share these feelings with family. My mother is still grieving and I don\u2019t want to burden, but its ok that\u2019s what reedit is for haha.\n\nFor some context. I am a 30 year old male. My parents split when I was a baby and both remarried shortly after. I like to tell people that I was lucky enough to be raised by four people that hailed from different parts of the world. (American, Puerto Rican, German, Suriname/Netherlands) This cultural exposure had profound benefits for me and even though there were a total of six other children between the four people, I was the only sibling in this unique situation\n\nHenk, my step father, was a very accomplished software engineer and an ex body builder. He was also THE handyman. He built a friggen mother in law suit in the back yard when I started high school so I could learn how to live alone. He didn\u2019t pay to have it built, he built it with a small crew. He also knew that it would increase the value of his property. Every decision he made was planned out, methodical and smart. I cannot put into words the valuable things this man has taught me.\n\nHe grew up in the South American country of Suriname. Life was hard for them sometimes, there were periods where they didn\u2019t even have cups to drink out of. While life was not easy back then in that country he had a large family (11 brothers and sisters) and the all loved each other fiercely. Side note, all of the brothers and sisters are super successful Doctors, Lawyers, Dentists ect. Their parents instilled this intense discipline and drive into their children. This was a drive that he carried throughout his life and a drive that he passed down to me.\n\nIn 2016 he was so excited to start this new position at a local power company. When he started though, he saw that there were some desperately needed changes needed in the organization. He spent the next few weeks making this presentation that he would give to his boss. I hear that presentation blew the socks off everyone in the room and he was promoted to an executive position shortly after. His hard work for the last 50 years just paid off and he loved that job so much. He kept working there throughout most of the cancer treatments till the absolute very end. I think that was his life goal being completed.\n\nIn early 2017 on an unremarkable weekend, I drove up to visit my parents for the weekend. We were supposed to be tackling some yard work for my mom, but Henk kept complaining that his stomach was hurting and he was stuck in bed the whole time I was there. The weekend passed and I go home not thinking anything terrible was happening.\n\nNow my parents didn\u2019t want to tell the children, so while they found out that he had cancer that week we didn\u2019t find out for about 5 months.\n\nI lived about 5 hours away by car so I didn\u2019t visit that often maybe 3-4 times a year. So as I was making my plans to come up they had to tell me about his cancer. By this point they had flow to Mexico to try holistic meds, my mom being in the medical field was running circles around these doctors. I went to an appointment once and my mom was telling the doctor what need to happen next haha. Shes a bad ass too but that a different story. He also had this port in his shoulder you will have to google it if you don\u2019t know, but basically it\u2019s a quick access to your blood. He was also stage 4 by this time and was in terminal status\n\nI have a very curious mind and I would ask some tough questions like \u201cHow are you feeling knowing the diagnosis is this bad?\u201d In the binging he would respond with something that made you feel everything was going to be alright. But over the following months I saw this strong proud man wither away.\n\nAbout two weeks before he died, I had taken him to the hospital to get blood drawn, by this point he was skin and bones, could barely walk and was in constant pain. On the way home he told me that life is not meant to live like this. I understood how miserable his life had become and I almost agreed with him, but I didn't want him to lose hope.\n\nThe day before he passed I got a call from my mom, that Henks in the hospital and he said that he not going to be here in the morning. So I rushed down, by the time I arrived hours later he was unresponsive. Only one of his siblings lived nearby and could come on such short notice. Her three kids were there along with my mom and some family friends. We ALL slept on the floor that night in his room.\n\nWaking up I remember my first though being \u201cis he gone?\u201d He was still alive though, but to everyone\u2019s amazement he was still alive. You could swear a party was going on that morning in his room. All of a sudden my step father gained a little consciousness and he almost looked angry and shocked that he was still alive. My mom noticed and immediately started crying and made this shriek that broke my heart.\n\nOver the next few hours Henk would come and go out of consciousness while almost yelling that he wants to die in his own bed. I\u2019m so happy that the hospital rushed his discharge so he could go home. It was about 9pm by the time we arrived home. We layed him in bed and I started playing his favorite songs and his whole family was around him. We were sharing memories out loud and telling him how much we loved him. Shortly after midnight I remember saying \u201csee Henk, you have a whole new day ahead of us.\u201d\n\nIm unsure the exact time he passed but sometime early that morning he opened his eyes and was just looking at my mom for like 10 minutes, almost like he was admiring her, and then he looked and stared at me. It almost felt he was trying to tell me to take care of my mom, and then\u2026he died, I was holding his hand for his last breath. I could see the light just leave his eyes, his whole life experience all the troubles and obstacles and achievements and accolades\u2026just faded away. He was now a memory.\n\nI think I out of necessity I never really grieved, I cried one night about 3 weeks after, but that was it. I needed to be strong for my devastated mother I felt.\n\nLast night however; I had to go to the emergency room for a bacterial infection that was starting to spread to my kidneys. It was an easy fix, they gave me some antibiotics in an Iv and I was better in a few hours. That was my first time back in a hospital though since that day. This torrent of feelings just erupted and I started crying. I kept thinking that\u2019s exactly how the end of his life started, he has some small discomfort, but instead of the doctor saying it was be fixed with some medicine, they told him he was going to die and he probably had about the same amount of pain as I did initially.\n\nMy overall outlook on life I feel has changed from this experience. I can be sitting in my living room and I am worried about getting hit by stray bullets. When I get in my car before I start I pause and ask myself is this the last time I start my car, was that the last time I get to tell my mom that I loved her? I used to love going out with friends but now I am too afraid of large crowds. I don\u2019t know how this developed, and I don\u2019t know what to do. I haven\u2019t told anyone but I think I had an anxiety attack a few weeks ago after thinking these thoughts.\n\nI need help and I have no idea what to do, can you be in shock for a year and not know it? I think the recent hospital visit just brought to the surface what I have been feeling since he left.", "subreddit": "GriefSupport"}

She was only 57 years old, and I am 26. I have so many good memories of her, and I am fortunate that I stayed home through university so I could have more time with her as an adult. She beat cancer once, and it came back a year later. She was given 3 to 5 years upon her new diagnosis, but only made it to one year before passing away in the hospital. She fought so hard, and was determined to come home until the day she passed. I miss her so much, but I feel okay for the most part for some reason. I was her only child and she did not have a spouse or any family or friends who visited regularly. I took care of her for so long, gladly, but it wore me out. I don't know if I had accepted what was going to happen so long ago and over the entire year when things went wrong over and over, that now I have dealt with a lot of the feelings that I should be having so intensely now, but I almost feel relieved. Relieved that she isnt suffering anymore, that my life can be about other things besides cancer and doctors appointments and hospital rooms. I used to worry constantly, and sometimes I will start to worry myself, but then remember that she is no longer in pain and does not need me anymore. Life is less uncertain. I miss her, even the times I spent caring for her, but it was so heartbreaking and exhausting for me do by myself. It's so weird. The first few days, I felt empty and like I was just there. Nonstop crying and feelings of intense anger and guilt and shock. What you would expect. Now it hurts, and I miss her, but now I feel very positive for about 70 percent of the day. I think about wanting her back, but knowing she would still be suffering even if she came home from the hospital. I think about what if she never got sick, but our relationship was much worse before she got sick (she was a functioning alcoholic but then stopped drinking after her diagnosis), so I dont want to think about that. I think we had beautiful memories together after she got sick, and I couldn't imagine not having them. So many meaningful talks and time spent shifting each other with love and support. The only things that really tear me apart are imagining going through motherhood without her and getting married without her. I don't know if this is normal though, for grief after losing someone to a long term illness? I feel like I should be worse but I am healing faster than I thought. I know things will get worse again over time, and then get better again, and back and forth, but this is just so different to me. Has anybody else had a similar type of though process?

In short, its a cancer that effects your white blood cells. Its not a cancer that can be cured, it requires you to go through chemo until a certain protein is at normal levels. When they go back up (and they will...can take a few months to years), thats when chemo starts again. My grandpa has always been tough as nails. He survived his gallbladder going gangrene, a serious car accident, went through chemo, and would not retire by any means until he was physically unable to work. It always seemed like no matter what happened to him, he always bounced back to be good 'ol grandpa again. His levels have been going back up indicating the need for another round of chemo. He was optimistic despite his first round taking a huge toll on him physically. The man I knew him as took a complete 180. He no longer stood as tall, he lost a lot of weight, he couldn't take care of his roses in the front yard... But I am so lucky that he has always kept his mind. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIn December, he was taken to the hospital because he was feeling very ill. His kidneys were failing. He was started on dialysis and once again he started being good 'ol grandpa again. He was too weak to come to my uncle's house for Christmas, so we brought Christmas to my grandma and grandpa. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe other day I get a call from my father saying my grandpa was back in the hospital. Like I said, my grandpa has always had a sound mind (his brothers all ended up with alzheimer's or dementia). My dad told me my grandpa started to hallucinate. He was claiming he was talking to his dead brothers and \"seeing angels\" and he didnt know where he was. My grandma rushed him to the hospital. Now we are at a cross roads. His dialysis doesnt seem to be helping as well as it should and his medications arent either. His medications can be changed but if dialysis needs to be stopped, thats when we need to think about hospice care. This gives him a 2-3 week life span. It is possible that there is an infection that dialysis is \"hiding\" so they are testing his blood, which would explain his hallucinating and deliriousness. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhile he has come out of a lot, i feel as if this is his last fight. All of his brothers, before they passed, shared a common theme - They all claimed to have seen their dead parents or siblings before they passed away. I am not religious but I feel like this is a sign that we need to be ready. I have been trying to prepare myself for this but even though it has come, I do not feel ready. I never lost a close family member before. I have lost a family dog when i was 11, which feels like i lost a brother since he was my best friend and I have no siblings. I never dealt with grief well. I am 300 miles away from home (in college) so i feel alone in dealing with all of this. I could use all of the advice I can get in trying to cope. I will be going to visit my grandpa very soon at the hospital but i do not want him to see me cry. ", "subreddit": "GriefSupport"}

I helped babysit this little boy, went to his peewee football games with the family; I saw this kid grow up these past 11 years. \nHe was extremely intelligent,  was going to be valedictorian, saw the bigger picture and decided there was no point (boyfriend read brother's suicide note to me). He and his were brother were extremely close, especially after their parents divorced several years ago. He knew his brother was depressed about the divorce but not enough to lead to this, he didn't see it coming at all.\nSo there are some factors that illustrate our relationship with depression:\n-my father had depression, was in and out of behavioral hospitals, suicidal, sometimes took antidepressants, mostly self -medicated with alcohol\n-I have been hospitalized for depression/suicide, on my 6th antidepressant right now, doing okay\n-boyfriend has history of depression and cutting, self-medicates with drugs\n-boyfriend's mother found the body of her mother after she killed herself. Also found the body of her youngest son after he killed himself. \"Oh honey, btw there's a lot of mental illness in our family\"\n\nSo the family and I are very sympathetic to the pain my boyfriend feels, understands what it's like to be on both sides of depression. \nSince then (Aug 2017) boyfriend is EXTREMELY depressed. Started smoking cigarettes. No longer cares about his appearance; he used to be well groomed and hygenic, very into his clothes and his look. He's grown out his facial hair, doesn't take care of it i.e. food stays in his beard for way too long. Showers every day, but doesn't use soap every day, hardly ever washes his hair and it looks like he's getting cradle cap (google it). \nHe and his father let the house go; garbage on the floor, cat and dog feces on the floor, mountains of laundry, dust and cobwebs. The house contains bf, his dad, dad's girlfriend, girlfriend's teenage son. I come over and clean about once a week, but it falls back into chaos when I leave. It's been consistently like this for a year and six months. None of them cook anymore, it's fast food morning, day, and night. Bf and dad stay up all night, sleep all day. When they have work they'll stay up 24-48 hours on adderall. None of them are taking care of themselves hygenically, nutritionally, emotionally,  mentally. \nIt's been over a year and I don't know how to go about saying, \"Alright now, time to be human again.\" I've been there, eating poorly and not showering for weeks when I've fallen into that hole. I know what it's like, my father passed away when I was 17.  But this has been going on for 18 months. They appreciate my cleaning and doing laundry and I think it helps a little, but I really think they either need counselling or a slap in the face (metaphorically). They're a Navy family, maybe they need a drill sergeant? \nI would be pissed if my bf told me to change my hair or give me hygiene tips, so I can't flat out to tell him to cut his hair, shave, shower with soap every day, go back to caring, eat better, stop staying up late, stop disassociating. I don't  know what to say. The best I've got right now is gently encouraging positive behavior when he does occasionally do chores or takes care of himself.\nI.e. Aww babe you beat me to the laundry. Your room smells nice. You smell good, what shampoo is that? \nAm I too impatient wanting him to go back to the way he was?\nShould I let him take as much time as he needs to heal?\nIs it shallow that I want him to look good again? \nI find him really attractive and I still love him,  but he looks so different now. Like a pod person. \n\nTL;DR Boyfriend's little brother killed himself 18 months ago. He hasn't been the same. Is it too soon to encourage him to go back to his regular life?

She was at times in some danger but never said anything. We found out that about a month or two before she died she was almost shot. Her boyfriend at the time was suicidal, she came home to find him with a shot gun in his mouth and of course she tried to stop him..I\u2019m sure you can imagine how that fight went.

She was in life support for 24 hours, she had a death clock,as we called it, above her bed counting down the hours until it had to be pulled. The hospital kept her on the 24 hour life support due to being an organ donor. I\u2019m sure none of you want to know all the details but I have to get this out.

She helped me grieve my dad but who is supposed to help me grieve my mom? I was 23 when my mom died. 23 year olds still need their moms. Anyone that age still needs parents and I didn't even have one. My heart breaks every day that I let myself think about it. I don't know how to even process any of this.

It worried me a lot then. However, my dad is a diabetic and his diabetic doctor told him that the weight loss was attributed to changes in his sugar levels due to the diabetes. Still during the past year I was extremely concerned and worried. There weeks ago after suffering with back pain for nearly a month my mom took him to the emergency room. \n\nI am in recovery and attend NA meetings so during that Sunday I was drinking my coffee when my mom called me and told me they found a mass and it is serious. I met one of my fellow homegroup members and gave him the keys to open up the meeting. I open and set up the meeting and also serve as treasurer. I came to the hospital and saw the look on everyone's face and I knew it was serious. My family told me that they had found a mass in the pancreas and spots in the liver. And I also learned that my father has lost 70 pounds in the last year. I knew the weight loss was significant but to hear that really broke my heart. My wife and I stayed with my family until about 4:30 that evening and we decided to go to a meeting and come back. \n\nAs soon as I got to the meeting I received a call that we need to return to the hospital immediately. They mass was around his arteries and surgery was not an option. My dad stayed in the hospital that night. And i went home with my wife. As i got home I felt like this empty feeling. Like a shock to my soul. It felt like a part of me was missing. My father and I are best friends and he has always been there. He was there during my addiction. My recovery. Graduating from college. Getting accepted to law school. And the millions of childhood memories of being his little boy. Of looking up to him with his dark Ray-Ban glasses. A thick mustache and a truly heart warming smile. That first night just confirmed what I knew. My Dad is sick. He is going to die. All I thought about was fishing with me Dad again. Going to the casino and smoking cigarettes and playing penny slots. Of telling him all I learn in the day. All my worries, concerns, fears, and triumphs. \n\nThis brings me to today. We met with the oncologist and he confirmed our worst fears. My father has Stage IV pancreatic cancer. In the words of the doctors it is \"really bad.\" My sister sobbed in the room. My mom did too. My little brother caved to the floor looking at the stail hospital tile. I didn't cry. I asked the doctor questions. My dad is stubborn so he didn't tell the doctor how much pain he really is in. So I told the doctor and he made sure to prescribe medication that was appropriate. He told us how chemotherapy was the best option. So this coming Wednesday my father begins chemo.\n\nI am terrified right now. I call my sponsor every day to talk and seek guidance. He has lost a wife and father to cancer. I go to meetings. But I feel alone in my grief. I go to law school and sit through lectures on civil procedure and criminal procedure. But it is hard to focus. I have been having nightmares. And I now use an eye cover when I sleep because my old fear of the dark has come back. Also, I am grateful to have my father. I love him. I bought him digital audio recorders for my mom and my siblings. So whenever he wants to tell us something he can. They have hundred of hours of space so he told me he will fill it up. I never want to forget my dad's voice. \n\nI never post on reddit but this occasion calls for me to post. I need support and I hope that others can offer their experience, strength, and hope. My mother is devastated and so is my little brother. They are looking for me for strength. Today I bought everyone pizza and went and picked up my dads prescriptions. I do not want to be selfish in this process. I want to walk through it with compassion and empathy. Recovery has taught me to live in acceptance and surrender. And this situation is the toughest situation I have faced. I know I am not the first or the last. I am a little more empathetic today than I ever have been. \n\nI am clean today and I am a good man.

We hadn\u2019t seen or heard from him for over 2-3 years. I stopped allowing him visitation when I found out that he was keeping my son on his weekends in a car in A Walmart parking lot and begging for money and living recklessly. Because he was so far behind on child support his drivers license was revoked and he moved to a neighbor state to work. He stopped talking to my son. He started having heart troubles due to sucking down red bulls like water daily and smoking $500 a week of the K2 (fake weed) that he admitted to. We lost contact with him. The only way I could keep up was through a fake Facebook page (since I was blocked). He would occasionally post his health condition and location. He was put on a heart transplant list but was eventually denied. Last month his family reached out to me and told me that he was in a neighboring city and was dying and he wished to see our 14 year old son.  I left the decision up to my son and we ended up going to see him before they took him off life support and through his death. My son got to say his forgiveness. I did not. I stayed by his side and made sure he was as comfortable as he could be but I couldn\u2019t say my peace. The verbal abuse through the years and the fact he abandoned his responsibilities to our son was too much to put in words. \n\n1 month later we are finally able to have a service for him. He was cremated and having a  veteran service. His family wanted to put some ashes in a red bull can... yes, you read that right. A veteran, in the national cemetery, in a can of the drink that helped to destroy his heart. I put a stop to that quick and found a small wooden box to put him in. I work at a print shop and took it upon myself to make the programs and a big picture of him in uniform. My son will have a proper service for his father. Yesterday was horrible. I walked in to work to see his picture laid out on the table as they were mounting it and his programs on the printer. One of my peers snuck a picture frame in to my office that said \u201cAmerica calls him a soldier, but I call him dad\u201d for my son. I lost it. \n\nOn the way home I hear the new cage the elephant song \u201cready to let go\u201d.  Paul\u2019s song on his phone that you would listen to as it rang for years was their song \u201cain\u2019t no rest for the wicked\u201d  that sings \u201cain\u2019t no rest for the wicked until we close our eyes for good\u201d. The chorus in the new song is, \u201cima spread theses ashes, I\u2019m ready to let go\u201d. I\u2019m listening to this song on repeat over and over spiraling down mentally to the craziness of this all when I get a video from my son called \u201csend this to your mom with no context\u201d. It\u2019s a kid dancing in their room to goofy music and graphics that state that \u201cI want to thank you for everything you do for me...\u201d.. I have  never cried tears of sadness while laughing hysterically at the same time! My mom always said \u201cone day your son will understand everything you\u2019ve sacrificed for him\u201d. Bawling. \n\nSo today is the day. We are meeting up with his family for lunch and memorial then the service where my son will be presented the flag. I think I\u2019m taking this harder than my son. I have two best friends coming with us to support my son and keep me together. I have no idea what I\u2019m going to do or say or even feel.  He was my first love but he was also my biggest regret. I found saved text messages in my email as I was making his program where he was calling me horrible names, telling me what a bad mother I am and how my son will always choose him over me. (That made it really hard to write nice things about his life in the program). But then I find pictures when we were together holding each other, cuddling as a family on the couch etc. This chapter in my life is so close to the end but so climatic to me. Please pray that I make it through with some closure. \n\nThanks for reading if you made it to the end! ", "subreddit": "GriefSupport"}

I apologize in advance and cookies if you make it to the end. :)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLast summer, at 73 years old, my loving FIL passed away quite unexpectedly from a heart attack. Nothing has been the same since. I don't think any of us are handling it well - even still - and I'm not sure what to do about any of it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe're a close knit family. My husband has 2 sisters (SIL1 and SIL2) and his mom. My MIL has always had some pretty major anxiety issues. FIL was her balance to those and now he's not there for that. (Yes, he enabled, but it worked for them. No, we're not doing that.) She does see a physician, she does have meds. Briefly, she went to a grief support group and it seemed to help her, but she stopped when it disbanded and didn't seek out an alternative (though to be honest, there's one where I work twice a month \\[I work at a funeral home\\] and I've considered asking if she'd go with me? It's nights. I'd have to drive her). As expected, she has good days and bad days. Lately, it seems like she's having more bad days than she'd been and hey, for all I know, that's normal too.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe issues come like this: We live right next door to MIL. This is actually ok. I have always gotten along with DH's parents and adore them to bits. Since I'm married to the only son, we end up doing the maintenance on her home as well (she will pay him for parts, he won't let her for labor). We help with shopping, put the trash out at the roadside for pick up (she has mobility issues and we're in the north in the throes of winter), get her mail/newspaper, etc.  Hubby (or I if he's traveling for work) goes down with her every evening for an hour or so before bed so she isn't alone all the time. If I don't cook something extra and send it down with him, if she doesn't come up and eat with us for Sunday dinner, she eats garbage - either filling up on candies (and complaining of not feeling well) or instant/processed shit. Because I get it, cooking for one sucks. So I don't mind sending food down OR having her eat with us Sundays if that means I know she's eating and eating healthy.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt's more that I'm worried her give a damn is completely busted and I don't think she has any interest at all in fixing it. She's lost her spark and her glow. Her anxiety is always through the roof - she recently broke down into tears over returning something locally that had been ordered for her online because the process was different. I can't help but wonder if there's something more the doctor could do - meds or counseling - but then hubby pipes up \"she's always been like this\" like his normal meter is busted - but what if she doesn't need to be? She has other things going on that she has meds for so for all I know, she's run out of options and this IS the best it gets.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo how can we help her? Or help her want to help herself again?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThere's adult grandkids, all living locally. Of them all, my son is the only one that sees her regularly. The others text her like that is a replacement for seeing her and spending time with her. She gets lonely. She wants to see other family besides us, but when everyone is out of work is evening and she can't drive at night, so needs them to come to her. They don't.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSIL1 lives 1 town over. Suddenly she doesn't like driving at night either, leaving her weekends free to come over. She doesn't. She was fairly absent before FIL passed away and she's still absent.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSIL2 is ... a piece of work. She also has some pretty major anxiety issues of her own, does have meds, does see someone, but when she comes up (usually one weekend a month), she and MIL get into an anxiety loop and it's usually amped up for both of them. SIL2 hounded FIL before he passed away about every ache and pain and then he died anyway (on a day she was here). She somehow has it in her head that she should have been able to save him and if something happens to MIL, if she doesn't sleep when she visits then she'll be able to save MIL if something happens. It's completely and utterly irrational and SIL2 is driving herself mad for it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nANY thing to indicate we need more help is met with sniffles and tears (I get it, it's emotional) and SIL1 will say she'll try to help more - but then she doesn't follow through. SIL2 is limited in how much she is able to come - she's 2 hours away and weather doesn't always cooperate.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI dunno. I'm not even sure what I'm asking anymore. I mostly needed to brain dump, I think. I adore my MIL and DH. I truly don't mind helping out, I just wish it felt like we had more support from his sisters and even the other grandkids.", "subreddit": "GriefSupport"}

Only to find out that I have a very short time to do this with my great grandfather. Over the last couple of days I have found myself to be quickly attached to him and finding him to be a really interesting person. I dont want to accept that he will not be around that much longer and I havent really had the chance to make some actual memories with him. It really is starting to break my heart a bit. \n\nMy grandad and him have now made amends and are in contact too, but he is also cleary very upset and they have both said they were wrong to part ways so long ago. Its really confusing and I feel like a fake around all the relatives who were around him and supporting him throughout his life. I feel like if I was to get upset around them I would look like a fraud is thats even a thing. But he really is a wise and lovely man and I really wish I could have grown up around him. I have noticed I am very much like him in many ways as I am also very much like my grandad, and we definitely have the same stubborn, bossy nature with hearts of gold.

I went home on public transit almost every day to make sure they were okay, and I told my brother to call 911 if Dad ever talked about killing himself.

But then he felt he was over it and stopped going. He went back to work and things were okay for a bit.

He forgot he had grandchildren. \n\nI have several random topics with my brother that if he calls or texts me about, I know what he really means is that Dad is getting agitated or otherwise starting something dangerous.

We would end the night with everyone snuggled up in bed with lots of purrs and tummy rubs. Yesterday Marvin started acting weird and would yelp anytime I picked him up.

She had a lifelong fight with COL-4A1 Leukodystrophy that she inevitably lost. Her death was not what we were expecting, as the doctors told us she would probably make it to around 30 years old. When she was 13, she had a mini-stroke that changed her entire personality. That in and of itself was so hard because I felt like I had lost who I knew my sister to be. She was amazing at basketball, gymnastics, and was overall an athletic and happy girl. She was always unique and we joked that she always had to be different from everyone else. We had no idea how true that was, seeing as her diagnosis of COL-4A1 was only the 66th to ever be done. Wednesday she was fine. She began seizing on Thursday morning for what seemed to be no apparent reason. She was conscious after the first one, and I was told she was terrified as to what was going to happen next. She was sedated in order to calm her heart rate. She never woke up, and I never got to have one last conversation with her. Friday came along, and they gave her an MRI. Saturday, they showed us the scans and told us her brain was over 75% blood at the time of the MRI (her brain was likely more damaged at this time) and there was nothing they could do. Sunday night, we disconnected the ventilators. My mother wanted me to be in the room when we did it, saying I would regret not being there later. That was the most traumatizing experience of my life, seeing the nurse and respiratory therapist pull the tubes out of her mouth and watched one of my best friends turn purple almost instantly. She wasn't able to breathe on her own very well and her O2 levels dropped from 100 to 4. Just over an hour later, they called time of death. 8:55 PM, Sunday, February 3rd 2019. That time is burned into my brain. The last week has seemed like a blur. I barely get any sleep because of the nightmares. I'm okay as long as I'm occupied, but as soon as I think about it for one second or even just try to process that she's gone, I lose all control. I haven't cried this much in my entire life. My other sister and I are planning on getting ladybug tattoos, since that was her favorite \"animal\" and when she was younger that's what she wanted to be when she grew up (yes, she wanted to be a ladybug). Her birthday is almost exactly 2 weeks after her death. I was hoping she would see that day, but nothing ever goes how we want it to. I'm not a religious person. I don't really believe in an afterlife, but, God, do I want to right now. I want to believe that she's still somewhere, shooting hoops and doing flips. Just wanted to put my story out there.

Still, that's a lot, for me. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\njuly 2017, i got a second cat, because i work weird, long hours and my dude got screwy when i left him alone too long. i went to the humane society intending to bring home a different cat, but i found her in the room, all shaved up and in the litter box, shivering and terrified and i ignored the other ones and i sat next to her and moved my hand real slow and she shook like you do when it's bitter cold and the wind is going hard. like every muscle in her body wanted to rip itself off the bone and run as far away from me as possible. she held her ground, and i petted her and she purred. she purred so loud and hard it made her hiccup and she looked like shit. she lived in the litter. the attendants said she never left. she reeked, man. cat piss is bad enough, but old cat piss. all three of the cats in the little room just kinda had no choice but to piss on her. the humane society people said they were doing their best to keep her clean, but she would just go right back into the box, and cats have to pee, so... you do your best. shaved from the ribs to the ass. looked like she was wearing parachute pants and a tank top made of fur. rail thin. maybe a year old, but it was hard to tell since she was so skinny.  I could nearly put my hand around her at the belly and touch my fingers together. she looked like i always felt. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\ni couldn't bathe her because she'd just been spayed and still had her stitches in. i got those nature's miracle pet wipes and a brush and fingernail scissors and worked at the mats and the smell every day. she wouldn't clean herself. she was terrified. she hid behind the toilet. she hid in her litterbox. finally, i bought one of those little softsided huts and i put it in my bathroom cupboard where it was dark and quiet and i folded my hoodie in there so she'd get used to my smell. it took days, but eventually she didn't smell like pee, and i got rid of all the mats, and she stopped shaking so much when i petted her, and she kept purring and purring. she still wouldn't groom herself. it took maybe three or four weeks, but one day i was cleaning her, i'd hit her with the wipe and follow it up with the brush, and she just started following along behind me. a couple weeks after that, she moved out of the bathroom. she was terrified of everything, except food. she stole steaks off the counter. burgers. chicken. anything that was meat and not bolted down, she would run off with. she was like a dickens character, a filthy victorian little street urchin, except stealing protein instead of watches. i eventually moved to giving her a little wet food every day, and she got off the theft, too.  Which is eventually how she got her name, because every morning when I woke up, she would holler at me until I fed her. Just constant, the ugliest little truck stop waitress rusty meow, and i'd be standing at the counter and she'd be up on her hind legs giving me the business and I'd say, \"Quit yellin at me, dad.\" and it stuck. dad the cat.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\ni don't sleep much. i'd like to say it was because i'm busy, but it isn't. i ghost my way from website to website. think about things i wish i wanted to do, or just mindlessly read articles, or stories, or facebook updates. and dad was always right there. My copilot on the couch, hotglued to my leg and purring so loud. as soon as she got next to you, she purred. purred until she hiccuped and had to stop a second and catch her breath. claws like tiny needles. yesterday morning about four am i was reading a book and i heard her working on a hairball under the bed. she'd been doing that hacky-half cough thing a lot lately and for like the twentieth time i thought i should take her to the vet and see if she wasn't allergic to something. i'd changed her food to some hairball control formula, and i'd taken to brushing my other cat more often because he sheds an insane amount and she groomed him more or less incessantly. dad didn't shed much. it seemed to be working, because she didn't seem to be doing it as much. she never really hacked anything up. so when she didn't stop, this time, i put my book down and i went looking for her, and she came out from under the bed limping and breathing hard and wheezing and scared and she went into her little soft hut that i kept next to the bed for when she got scared, and she couldn't sit down, just kinda threw herself in circles and i petted her and she wouldn't purr. just breathing shallow and putting her face in the darkest corner.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\ni took her to the emergency vet, and they said she needed a chest x-ray because she had a heart murmur and then they said $600 for everything, or i could wait two hours and go to a vet with a sliding scale. i don't have $600 just for xrays, if more emergency shit needs to be done, so i brought her home and sat with her til the other vet opened up. xrays said she had an enlarged heart. maybe heart failure, maybe pneumonia. every time they took her out of the room to do something else to her, i couldn't stop crying. they'd bring her back and she just sat in her carrier breathing fast and shallow and not shivering and not purring and she wouldn't even move. she wouldn't walk to me. she would just sit and stare at the wall of the soft sided carrier. i put my hand in there and she went to sleep on it in between the vets and aides comin in to talk to me. they were very nice. they gave me a lot of time. but the blood tests said heart failure, and i was so mad. i hate calling it that. her fuckin heart didnt fuckin fail. fuck right she had an enlarged heart. it was so goddam big. but genetic defects like this you can't fix. my options were to take her home and maybe they could get her out of heart failure for now but she was going to die soon, or we could end it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\ni wanted to bring her home so bad. i wanted to. i wish she was home right now. i wish she was there to always jump up on the couch or bug me when i went to bed. my warm, purring proof i could have love i could share love i could enrich a life by loving something and i knew because she couldn't purr and she couldn't walk and she didn't meow and she wasn't shivering that she was going to go soon, and i didn't want it to be when i was gone, and she was alone, i work 12 hour shifts, i didn't want it to be dark and come home and find her, terrified and in pain and have to do this to her again, the terror of hauling her all over, the cat carrier that scared her, and the vet said it looked real bad, so i decided to make my friend die. and they put the iv port in her leg and they gave me time with her and i said goodbye as best i could and i kissed her little face and i rubbed under her chin like she likes and she stretched out her neck even though she wouldn't purr no more, and that breaks my heart, and they put the anaesthetic in when i said they could and she went to sleep and i thought her eyes would close and they didn't and they put the other thing in the kill thing and i was fuckin wailing and the vet put the stethoscope on her little chest and said she's gone now and i feel like i died too. she was still warm. and i curled her tail up gentle next to her body like she always did, like it was her little armor over her little chicken legs, and i kissed her again and she smelled good even though i always called her stinkybutt because she used to smell like pee, she smelled like warm cats smell but she wasn't there anymore and now no one's gonna yell at me no more, or keep me awake for twenty minutes before bed, purring so hard it made her hiccup. smashing her face into my hand for pets. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\ni feel desolate. i hate every piece of this with both hands. i took that cat from the gutter and it saved a piece of both our lives. i can't sit on the couch. i can't go to bed. my friend. my trash cat. my friend. my whole heart. my whole heart. my entire heart. i hope i dream about you and it's just us on the couch, i'd give anything just for that kindness. if there's a god or whatever or another life, i hope it's better, you got fuckin screwed this go round baby. i hope it's real. i hope i see you there. i hope you remember me. i hope i get to dream about you. i miss you so hard. if anyone comes for me when i die please be you. my friend. my little baby. my whole fuckin heart.

But at what cost, what really is comfortable? Comfortable isn\u2019t living. \nYou\u2019re living everyday with him not knowing when it\u2019s going to be his last. You see him get poked with needles everyday, never get to eat because he\u2019s tube fed, he\u2019s never run before and he\u2019s never gotten the chance to play the sports he so loves. I\u2019m not mourning him at this point, but mourning a life, a relationship. It\u2019s grief, it\u2019s sadness, it\u2019s anger. It\u2019s emotions I\u2019ve never been able to put names on. I\u2019ve never come home to an empty house before, I have strangers coming in and out of my house everyday, all day. I have nurses that have to be there 24/7. I have a weird life. It\u2019s weird because you don\u2019t want to be bitter about not having a normal life, you don\u2019t want to be angry at him. But it comes in waves, which are flooded with guilt and sadness for feeling that way. I\u2019m grieving, but it\u2019s a slow sorrow, a never-ending misery. He sits in bed, all day long, his bed facing a tv and a window and that\u2019s all his life is. There\u2019s days he doesn\u2019t recognize us. There\u2019s rare days when he does. Are those days worth his pain? I have no answers, I\u2019ve sought them for the 20 years of my life, I have none. I\u2019m not grieving his death yet, but I am grieving.

The hospital room where my dad spent the last two months of his life. \n\nHe was tired to fight diabetes, heart condition, kidney failure. He held on for soooo long. For his family.

Sad that my best buddy, my #1 fan, my mentor, my role model is gone. Happy that he isn't suffering anymore. Stressed because mom is also sick and alone, a 2-hour drive away, overwhelmed because she basically asked me to take care of everything (budget, savings, house, estate, stuff selling, insurance), completely disinterested by work (manager and colleagues have been STELLAR though), going through the motions in almost everything I do, like a robot.\n\nThis past week and a half has been difficult. I don't cry per se, but my eyes are always wet. I'm super sensitive about everything, antsy, angry, irritated. Even playing music, my go-to when I feel down, doesn't do anything for me at the moment.\n\nI've been thinking and reading a lot about death. What happens to the body in the last moments, what happens to the conscience, how people are going through the steps of shutting down the body, the mind. I talk to him multiple times per day, even though i'm in no way or form spiritual/religious.\n\nI know that my dad was still fighting a month prior, that he wasn't ready to die, to let go. That he didn't accept that death was coming sooner than later. He wanted to go back home, come visit my newly renovated house, even do some clean up so I didn't get stuck with his messy basement and garage...\n\nI think he was ready - he told my mom, and his doctor that he was thinking about stopping dialysis, the he was tired of fighting and suffering. I just wonder if he was at peace with it all. If he was scared.\n\nFor some reasons - you can read my post history if you want, you'll find them - I was the center of his life. I hope he knew that I was going to be okay, that he (they) did a great job raising me, and that even though it hurts a lot, that I was going to be okay after he was gone.\n\nI saw him briefly 10 days before he passed. He was in the dialysis room at the hospital, wasn't feeling well. We stayed 20-25 minutes maybe. HE wasn't feeling well at all, so he asked my mom and I to leave. \n\ni kissed him on the cheek and walked a few paces, turned around came back to him. Gently caressed the side of his face, kissed him again and told him \"I love you big guy\" and left.\n\nAt least, I'm sure he knew that when he died.

We went to the best hospitals. But after 4 years of fighting, over 5 different lines of chemo, countless cycles, radiation, it's came back so aggressive there was nothing we could do in time. He didn't meet the requirements for the clinical trials we felt could save him. He didn't have time for a donor transplant that might have worked and as hard as i tried we didn't get any sort of investigational drugs approved by the time it had consumed his entire abdomen. I still wish i would face reached out to the pharmaceutical companies that made the treatment we thought would work earlier for expanded access to the drug. I recieved an email back from them yesterday but it was far too late. His oncologist said she was calling to try to get these things done as well. \n\nWe forced him to go to the ER on Sunday and all he wanted to do was stay home. I think he already knew. When my mom told me on Monday that it had spread i left work immediately. By the time i got there the decision had been made. Nothing else could be done for him except make him comfortable. His oncologist called and i pleaded with her to try something. She said it would only extend his misery and probably make it worse. We asked my dad and he said he would do whatever we wanted but he just wanted to go home. A wish we weren't able to fill. \n\nHospice couldn't get the equipment to our house until today, 2 days later, and the doctors didn't think he would last that long. They were worried we wouldn't be able to control his pain without the equipment and he would suffer and we'd feel responsible. They also felt he wouldn't make the 2 hour ambulance ride back to our small town. By tuesday afternoon he had become almost completely unresponsive. We're going on 48 hours since he's said a word. They took him off fluids Tuesday morning. The myeloma had taken his left kidney 4 years ago and the current myeloma was destroying his right one. On Monday he was already severely dehydrated and yet 2 days without water and he still presses on. Tuesday night he became agitated and was grabbing at his mask so they gave him ativan. It's the only thing that seens to give him peace so we have the nurse give him more every 4 to 5 hours. Since then he hasn't been restless. \n\nI don't see any reason to make him consciously experience this anymore than he has to. We continue to play him music and talk to him. They told me i could say my last words to him on Tuesday but i didn't say anything. Everything either of us would say we already knew. My dad was never an \"I love you\" dad but i never once questioned his love for me. We had more of an actions speak louder than words relationship and he absolutely was there for me every single time i needed him. Or even when i didn't. Without judgment. With a smile on his face. We never had deep conversations about life but he didn't really have those with anyone. He was just a live in the moment sort of person. \n\nI graduated college the winter before he got sick. I moved back home and already something wasn't right but it would be 6 months before they found the mass. At the time i was trying to decide how far away i wanted to move away from home for an engineering job. I'm so glad i stayed. I was still doing construction (what i had done every summer) when they found the mass. I took off work to take him to radiation every day for 9 weeks. At 5'9 he got down to 123 lbs. I helped him get dressed, put his shoes on, it was a whole different perspective of this guy who i had grown up looking up to like he was a superhero. Then 2 months later it came back, and the next remission he would get 2 years. I started a local engineering job that didn't really have much to do with my particular interests but i got to spend time with my dad. I constantly 2nd guess whether i should move away to a better job during that time. All my friends from college had moved to these places I've needed even seen. But I'll never have to worry if i did the right thing. I'm so glad i stayed home. \n\nSo as i lay here typing this out on my phone i listen to my dad, wondering which breathe will be his last. So confused because i would finnnne anything to spend one more minute with him but at the same time wishing he could be at peace. So many emotions. I'm mad i didn't try to get that treatment sooner. I'm mad he doesn't get to live longer. I'm sad he'll never get to experience all the things that are yet to come in my life. I'm mad we find it humane to put our pets out of misery but we force fellow humans to suffer through every last second of these horrible diseases. I'm mad we couldn't get him home while he was still conscious. I'm mad we couldn't get him home at all and give him his last wish.\n\nMost of all I'm worried for my mom. They have been together since high school. Married since she was 19. They were inseparable. They did everything together. My dad was always on the go. Even during treatment he couldn't sit still for long. I don't worry about her taking care of herself. She's always paid the bills and everything but her life will change so drastically. So far she's seemed so strong. She broke down with me when the oncologist called while we were in the ER. But since then she's been a rock. Idk if she had accepted this, like my dad had, before we ever got the news. Maybe it had happened sometime in the last 9 months since the cancer had been refractory to all treatments with visit after visit to the hospital. I think she was as tired as my dad even though i know she never would have given up. I think what we did for my dad extended his life years. I think many places wouldn't have been able to handle this case. I think we gave him some great last few years and i'm so happy i got to be a part of it. Even through all the hospital visits and months stuck inside because he was immunosuppressed. \n\nI can usually always tell what my moms thinking. We're very close and i can almost always know what's going on but I'm so lost right now. I can't tell how she is. Has it not hit yet? Is she in denial? Is she trying to stay strong for me? Did she already accept what had happened?\n\nThey found out the cancer had turned more aggressive on her birthday weekend just over 2 weeks ago and now it's Valentine's day and she's about to lose her husband of 34 years. She has to be as mad and sad and confused as me. So i just sit here, waiting for whatever she need's from me. \n\nI can honestly say as a single guy my perspective has really changed after this. I really do wish my dad could have met his future grandchildren but it hasn't been something I've thought of much before now. Between work and helping them i didn't have much time. But maybe this is really selfish but when i die i want to be surrounded by as much love as my dad had this past week. He was a great father, husband, brother, etc. And it's times like these it shows.  I want that inseparable love he had with my mom. I want to do as well for my children as he had done for me. And i wish he would have been able to see me do it. Sometimes i wish i would have told him that but i know he already knew. ", "subreddit": "GriefSupport"}

It's been a long year, but I'm in a good place with it now. I have been extremely busy with work this week and haven't had much time to think about it or process where I was a year ago, but I'm going to take a half day tomorrow to take care of myself and possibly honor him in some way. What are your thoughts? I know this is affecting me and I have cried randomly over the last week, but haven't had time to let myself feel it.

{"post_id": "aqriic", "created_utc": 1550195660, "title": "Day of Absurdity", "author": "DeadmanWilliam", "self_text": "Two years ago today I lost my life. Two years since I last woke in my own bed, next to my wife, with my young children still sleeping warm, safe, and sound in their bedrooms. No one having any reason to think it was all about to end. Two years, today, since I kissed my wife for the last time. \n    \nIt was a typical Valentines Day for the climate... cold, steel gray winter day, dry but with somewhat threatening skies. I had a table reservation for six o'clock at my wife's favorite restaurant. How could I have known we would not be making that reservation, or that this was the last day of my life, as I knew it?\n    \nIn my memory, I see it all, as clear as if it was this morning. I see myself, I can feel the way I felt, I can even remember some of the things I was thinking about. But though I can stand there in that foyer, and see and feel my own hand on that door handle, and I can even turn to myself and speak to myself, \"dude- don't go. Just stay home today, and love your family as hard as you can.\" But that guy doesn't hear me. He just presses the latch and walks out, blissfully ignorant. He can't hear me- for some reason that continues to make no sense to me, unto absurdity, he cannot hear me, and I can't take control of the situation or change anything. Despite possessing the same DNA and handily defying the laws of physics by occupying the same point in space at the same point in time, there is a chasm as wide as eternity is long between us. I just walk on out, and leave them all, forever.\n    \nI wasn't really aware, in those days, of philosophy's notion of absurdity: the observation that the world as we know it, as it's been taught to us through signs and symbols and equivocation in the various forms of communication at our command, the world we're raised to take for granted, \"this is the way it is,\" to accept as simply what-is and how-is and who-is, is, in fact, quite ridiculous. There are too many examples of this to bother listing any; yours and mine are as unique as our perception of the uniqueness of our characters, and you've surely experienced plenty of your own. Striking moments of a certain kind of insight into the nature of a thing or things or all things, and you're immediately filled with the idea that it doesn't make sense afterall, or isn't right somehow, or some other generally alarming discovery of cognition.\n    \nBut I've since become intimately familiar with the absurd. You could say that I have ceased to live in the common mode of mind we think of as \"reality,\" have stepped out from behind the perceptual filter I was raised to view things through, and now exist in the uncomfortable fringe between conventional reality and... something else.\n\nIn my mind, as I sit here now, absently twisting my wedding ring around my finger, two years to the day later, I ought to be able to just go home. My children will be there, playing with toys or practicing piano or wrestling around in good spirit. They'll be the same as they were: two years younger than they would be today. My beautiful wife will be in the kitchen, cooking dinner or experimenting with some new cooking tool, technique, or combination of ingredients. She'll say \"helluuuu\" like she always does, when I come walking around the corner to the kitchen nook and set my briefcase in my chair. Why not? I am just as I was two years ago- and especially at this moment, of extreme familiarity. Wearing the clothes I wore back then, groomed how I was, even recently back in the same car I left in that horrible day- hell, the place I just moved into is even down the same highway I used to drive out of the city every day. Just like I am going home. Nothing has changed, on my end. My home is still my home. My family is still my family. My moderately successful but promising career is still so.\n\n\"No. You cannot go home. There is no 'home' to go to- it's all gone, forever,\" my goddamn self says to me. Even two years later, I can't wrap my mind around this. What do you mean, they're gone? What do you mean, the house has been sold? What do you mean, her family all moved away and absolutely nothing remains of the life I'd built for so many years there in that little town? The fuck you say- let me go home! I have to read to my kids tonight, kiss them goodnight, tuck them in, turn on their night lights and close the door. I have to go get into my bed and snuggle up to my wife and say \"happy Valentines Day\" softly into her ear one more time. This is what I do, it's my definition, my function, my purpose, all I've ever lived for, all I shall ever live for. The fuck you say, I can't go home!\n    \nAnd I did not go home. Not that night, not ever again. By this time, early afternoon, two years ago today, I'd received a phone call that marked the end of the man I was. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAll that you ever knew, everything, everything, everything has been taken from you, and\n\nfor no discernible, rational reason at all. Somebody got mad and made a choice he\n\ncouldn't take back.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm sure he wishes he could take it back now that \"justice\" has been done. He's not asked me for forgiveness, but I know what it's like to be young and do something stupid and regret it; I have sympathy and forgiveness for him. I wish him no ill. I love him.\n    \nBut I still haven't figured out how to exist for existence sake. That strikes me as absurd. The absurd is all that's left. \n\nIt's all so goddamn absurd.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThanks for reading,\n\n\\-DW", "subreddit": "GriefSupport"}

He fought hard for 10 days and died on February 25th. Because of the circumstances of his hospitalization and death, his birthday was the last time I *really* talked to him \n\nValentine's Day has never been a holiday for me, it's always been Grandpa's birthday. He was the most amazing man. He certainly had his faults, but I could not have adored him more. He was so central to my life. He was at every single school event, sports game, whatever, my entire life. He was so supportive, and he loved me, and our family so much. \n\nThe past year has been hard. I was accepted to my dream nursing school, and got to continue my graduate education at our shared alma mater. I never got to tell him. He would have wanted to know everything. He was the one who told me to look into nursing, and he supported me every step of the way as I struggled through science pre-requisites that I never thought I would pass. He would be so proud of me. I know it. I am so lucky to have a supportive, close-knit family, but no one asks the questions he would have asked. There have been so many times over the past year that I just wanted to talk to him, so many times that I just needed my grandpa. My dog looked for him for six months before realizing he wasn't coming back. \n\nI know losing your grandparents is expected, but I never expected to lose him the day after his birthday. His older sister turns 92 this year. We really thought we would have a few more years with him. He casually referenced his 90th birthday party more than once. \n\nToday was hard. But I had school all day. It felt like any other day in so many ways. Then I had dinner with my grandma, and the apartment felt exactly like it did a year ago. We had a nice dinner. We said I love you, and talked about him a little bit. I came home, sat down in bed, and burst into tears that I didn't expect. \n\nI just needed to type this out, even if no one reads it. I needed to share how much I loved him, how much I love him still, and how much I miss him.\n\nI miss you grandpa. I love you. Thank you for being you. I am forever grateful you were mine.

You're there for me if shit goes down\".\n\nYes, this happened. So why isn't it the opposite? What about \"When my dad died you didn't reach out once or even ask how I was doing. When we were kids you used to hang out at his house with my and spend days on end there. You didn't feel the need to reach out once?\".\n\nYes, this is some rambling but it's been really going around and round' in my head.

We were on and off for most of my teenage years and had a special connection. he was someone that even though things did not work out, I always managed to get back in contact with him even if a year or more went by without talking. He always reached back out. We were in communication before he died and he was trying to meet with me, but I was going through a bad break up with my most recent ex at the time and i just told him it wasn\u2019t a good time. I often think back and wish I had met with him because weeks later we\u2019re still chatting a bit through messages and texts, but then I started seeing these weird Facebook posts on his profile like \u201cSee you on the other side\u201d and stuff like that :(. I sent them to his sister because I was worried. I reached out to him too and he said he wasn\u2019t ok but couldn\u2019t talk about it. Then a few days later I got a call from his sister that he was dead. \n\n2018 was super rough as I also lost my job a month later after his passing and was just finding it really difficult to cope with it all. I felt like I lost part of my soul and didn\u2019t understand the point of life and why we try so hard to be whoever the hell we think we\u2019re suppose to be if it can just be taken away. And while I was sad, there was also a part of me that also felt bad, like, there are so many other people who loved him and knew him on a closer level than I did at the time, or at least on a more recent level than I did. I thought maybe I shouldn\u2019t feel so effected by this because our relationship was so long ago. But it was important to me to just go with my process of grieving him, so I mostly tried to ignore these thoughts.\n\nAfter months of binge drinking, eating poorly, crying a lot, and also doing whatever I could to stay busy, I decided it was time to move on. so I got some therapy, went traveling for a month in Europe, and now I\u2019m back and I feel like I\u2019m in a much healthier place. I met someone really great and I\u2019m happier than I\u2019ve been in a really long time. \n\nbut my problem right now is that I was just laying in bed trying to sleep with him and just started crying out of nowhere. I was just thinking back to where I was a year ago, in my hometown a complete mess, days before his funeral, and it made me so fucking sad. I started picturing his face and all the memories of his death started flooding back. Is this normal? Is it messed up that I was feeling this while laying with my current boyfriend? It\u2019s hard for me to talk about it now with him because 1) I\u2019m trying to move on from it and 2) I don\u2019t want him to feel like I haven\u2019t moved on. Because I have - I\u2019m trying.. it just comes in waves. Is it better to just keep it to myself? Or healthier to talk about it with him? Or maybe I should talk with someone else about it? He knows what happened and when we first met made it clear that he understood that what happened was a part of my life that won\u2019t be easy to forget. But I\u2019m just not sure how to deal with it now. Most days I feel fine, but tonight has been hard and it would be so random if I brought it up to him now because I haven\u2019t talked about him in months.\n\nAnyway this was kind of a rant but maybe someone else can relate or has advice.

I also feel as if I can't settle my emotions or the thoughts in my head unless I do. Just a few hours ago I learned that a friend of mine has passed. I've known him for a very long time but our relationship was strange, and I suppose it's what makes his passing hard for me to accept. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI don't want to call him 'selfish'. It feels like the worst word to use, but I've known him for close to 10 years and our relationship has always been so one-sided. He was a talented writer, the best I've ever known. For that, he was always someone I tried to impress and wanted to become. In his eyes, I was little else than a peer with a couple similar interests. But in mine, he was like the older brother you admired and struggled to keep up with; his skills and accomplishments were like a milestone I'd try to reach. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'd never tell him that though. He despised praise, no matter how slight or genuine; it always came off as flattery to him. In return, he rarely (if not never) praised others, but he was open to giving advice. Most of his inspiring words were harsh truths that many people are too afraid to face. Simple truths such as 'Planning and writing are two completely different monsters', but his words were true and valuable nonetheless. Perhaps you could say he was a pessimist, but he often tried to make light out of his bleak perspectives. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA change of profession and an increase in work hours made us grow apart. And for far too long. It'd been nearly a year since we last spoke. He was an emotionally distant person, yet I can recall several moments when we felt to speak as more than peers, but friends. However, I can't even recall our last conversation. Worse yet, a serious argument he had with a mutual friend caused him to burn bridges with our circle, myself included. And I always knew him as the type of person who never half-stepped anything he did. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEven if I had known how much our relationship had strained. Even if I tried to reach him in his final days, I couldn't. And now I can't even reach him at all. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt's strange. At the start of February, my wife lost her grandfather, and as grief-stricken as we were, I was able to accept it. Around three years ago, I lost my mother, and as much as it hurt me I was able to accept that too. Death was something that used to worry me sick in my youth, but somehow, as I grew up, I learned to accept that it was simply a part of life. But when it comes to my friend - someone who I don't think, but know thought little of me, ironic as it is, it's his death that I can't accept. And I know it's because there's so much I regret.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI wish the two of us spoke more.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI wish there was something more I could've said. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI wish he could've gone against everything he stood for and accept the respect I had. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI wish he didn't leave our circle with such hostile feelings inside him. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI wish that we were actually friends.

Generally speaking, while I think it's extremely unhealthy, I want to balance my opinion with his freedom to engage in whatever type of relationship he wants.

It's hurtful that he used me as a kind of bait-and-switch scenario, and communicates that forging this new dynamic/relationship is not as important as I consider it to be.\n\nOther than venting (which has already been helpful, thanks), I guess I am soliciting some kind of general advice from experience?

Not knowing how far away the other riders were, he went over a hill and it wasn't until he was at the top of the hill that he saw all of them completely stopped. They were stopped because they were doing a sharp right, and since there were so many of them, they all had to slow completely down. But when my dad saw them, it was too late. He, fortunately, didn't hit anyone else. He laid his bike down and I truly believe it was because he didn't want to harm anyone else. But this took his life. And I have been doing good.

I had wrapped half of my daughters presents and was starting to wind down and relax. That morning I received a text from her mother (we separated when she was 3) saying that our daughter was unwell and an ambulance had been called. She advised me to get to the hospital ASAP. During the drive to the hospital her texts became more frantic \u201cshe is unresponsive\u201d to the final text \u201cI think we are losing her\u201d.  Before I even got to the hospital, I knew it was really bad.\n\nWhen I arrived the look on the faces of the doctors and nurses confirmed my worst fears. They led me to her where she was surrounded by about 15 or so medical staff.  Her heart had stopped in the ambulance and from that point they had been unable to resuscitate her, they were giving up. I saw my beautiful daughters body laying there with tubes going into her hands etc and my world decended into a living nightmare.\n\nI held her hand for the last time and stayed with her, before finally saying goodbye and leaving the room.  I never for one moment thought anything like this could have happened to us, to her.\n\nI know all parents say it, but my daughter was amazing.  Kind, caring, bright and intelligent.  Every time she spoke my heart ached with pure pride.  She loved being with her family and friends more than anything in the world, and strangely didn\u2019t care so much for material things.  I even had to convince her to spend her pocket money.  She would often randomly tell me she loved me and we\u2019d have long conversations about all manner of things.  Always laughing and joking.\n\n8 weeks have passed.  The worst 8 weeks of my entire life.  Grieving has been agonising, every memory of a conversation, or a photo, brings it instantly rushing back, tears, pain in my chest and head.  I have processed a lot of thoughts in that time, and feels like a punch to the stomach to think we have lost our future together. I was looking forward to teaching her to drive, start college, giving her advice when she falls in love, have grandchildren, have her come to see me when I am old and show me how to work the TV.  Worst of all, she didn\u2019t deserve it, she didn\u2019t deserve to live such a brief life when she had so much to give.  \n\n\nIt turns out that her cold had quickly become an aggressive form of bacterial meningitis even though she didn\u2019t have the common telltale symptoms such as a rash.

When I met BF at 16 years old, he was my first relationship and the love of my life. I know some people would think I wouldn\u2019t know what real love was, but believe me that was it. Before then I was suicidal, engaged in self-harm and thought it impossible that someone could love me for what I was. I had done a lot of fucked up shit to myself. In other words, finding BF was a dream come true for me because I finally found someone who loved me. \n\nBut after 5 years together, BF passed away in an accident in Japan. Needless to say I was traumatised and relapsed many times after that. \n\nI thought I was moving on, so I became open to seeing other people. The first guy I dated after the incident was someone called G he was a total dick.  He found out about my mental condition and left me because he said he couldn\u2019t help me. I thought he was the closest person who could ever come to matching BF, and this is important later. \n\nI\u2019m currently seeing someone called W, and he\u2019s the most wonderful person ever. He loves me for who I am - the suicidal tendencies, the relapses where I would cry and he\u2019d hold me. He loves it all. He even goes to work late to accompany me to the psychiatrist and therapist and would buy me ice cream to reward me for going (I hate seeing shrinks, because of bad experiences when I was a young teen). \n\nEverything was fine and dandy with W until I bumped into G at my school 5 months ago. That\u2019s when things started falling apart. Something didn\u2019t seem quite right with W after that. It took me a really long time to figure out what it was and then I realised:\n\nI liked G because he reminded me so much of BF, but W is totally different from the two of them. And I realised that I could never say I love you to W because if I said it, I knew I\u2019d be lying, because I still loved BF, and all I wanted was to get him back. 3 years on and I still get nights where I wake myself up crying, or I have dreams that BF is alive and that he wasn\u2019t dead. \n\nI don\u2019t know what to do now. People say you can love more than one person, but I can\u2019t do it. I just can\u2019t. I miss him so much. I wish more than anything that he wasn\u2019t dead. And I feel so unfair towards W for my messed up state. I don\u2019t want him to be a replacement, it\u2019s a terrible thought. I know I sound selfish, not being able to move on and love someone else but I really don\u2019t know what to do. \n\nI really don\u2019t know what to do. ", "subreddit": "GriefSupport"}

Previous interests \u2013 even things you loved \u2013 can seem futile.\n\nYou aren\u2019t the person you were before. This experience of love that you\u2019re living has knocked you off course. When you gain your footing again \u2013 and that takes the time it takes \u2013 you\u2019re going to be facing a different direction. You\u2019ll have to find out how you fit here now, who you are in this new place.\n\nAnother thing to remember is that grief is intense: it\u2019s physical and emotional and spiritual and all sorts of other things. It takes a lot of energy to grieve. For many people, year two is worse than the first: your systems begin to come back online, your gaze is just slightly lifted from your feet. The world has changed. You have changed. You are still changing. The world hasn\u2019t righted itself, and you are just aware enough to know it.\n\nYou\u2019re aware enough to know you aren\u2019t where you want to be, and still broken-hearted enough to not be able to do anything about it.\n\nThat you want something different for yourself, even as you have no energy to find something different \u2013 that is the beautiful place. That\u2019s the place to lean on.\n\nIf there is any glimmer of interest, any spark of light or fascination, capture it. Lean into it. Lean towards it. Hurl yourself to face in that direction, even if that\u2019s the only motion you can make. Face what is good. Face what is love. Want that for yourself.\n\nGet greedy for those moments when you drop into your core, when you feel \u2013 not \u201cright,\u201d but righted.\n\nIt doesn\u2019t matter what you might \u201cdo\u201d with any of those fleeting sparks of interest. You don\u2019t need to find your direction, your path, through the rest of this life. You only need to take notice of what draws you, right now, and follow it. As best you can. One tiny little glimmer at a time.\n\nAnd sometimes, there are no sparks. The world is empty and boring and full of things that make you cry.\n\nYou want it to be different. It isn\u2019t different. That\u2019s annoying.\n\nYou can\u2019t fake interest. You can\u2019t just tell yourself to buck up and get on with it, throwing yourself into things that are empty and dry. It won\u2019t work. At the same time, you don\u2019t want to be this way.\n\nYou don\u2019t want to cry. You don\u2019t want tears leaking out at every possible moment, making you splotchy and weepy and red.  \nAt the same time, there\u2019s not a damn thing you can do about that.\n\nBeing angry at your own broken-heart is such a tricky thing.\n\nIt turns into this giant, escalating storm: tears. Then angry at tears. Then angry at yourself for being angry, for being unable to come to yourself with love. Angry that this is what you\u2019ve got now: a reason to have tears, and anger about tears, instead of the life you were living. You had a good life. Now you don\u2019t. More tears. More angry at self for having tears. And on and on and on and on it goes.\n\nCan you just notice it? I mean \u2013 catch yourself? A thousand times a minute if you have to? Can you recognize when you are heaping on the judgment and anger and frustration at who you are and what this is?\n\nWhat this is is a broken heart inside a deeply changed human, still alive in a world that doesn\u2019t make any sense.\n\nThe path here is to honor that, somehow. To allow it, to let it be okay that everything sucks and there is no point. To somehow stop apologizing for having a sensitized heart.\n\nIt isn\u2019t easy. None of this is easy.   \nAnd you are here, still, now.\n\nYou deserve a life that is honest and true, even \u2013 or especially \u2013 when what is true is pain. When what is true is the blank space: the places that haven\u2019t filled in.\n\nThe road here, the \u2018what do to\u2019 here, is to want love for yourself, even when you have no idea what that looks like. Even when you have no energy to explore it, even if you knew what it was.\n\nI don\u2019t know if it\u2019s possible; I don\u2019t know if it will help.  \nBut heave yourself in that direction.

At the beach everything was good there were some flags posted notifying of some risk but my mom was very confident that it was ok and for me it was but I\u2019m a good swimmer. I stupidly wandered off from my mom while we were out there and my goggles were super foggy and I need glasses so the goggles were my prescription but with all the fog it was super hard to see. I wanted to let my mom know I was going to head in to go and use some of the de-fog stuff we had on the beach but I couldn\u2019t spot her and decided I\u2019d just quickly go into land and then head out there again and try and find her. After I cleared my goggles I noticed her speaking to a man out in the distance; I was able to recognize her haircut and the colours she was wearing. I headed out towards her and I thought they were just having a conversation but as I got closer I noticed my mom seemed panicked and I asked her what was wrong and she didn\u2019t seem to be thinking very clearly and said she got rolled by a wave. The man explained to me that she was just having some anxiety and she was alright so I wasn\u2019t too worried but I did notice her face was pretty pale, her lips were purple, and her airway wasn\u2019t very clear as she had a wheezing noise in her breathing. Me assuming she was having a panic attack and lost some oxygen, decided with the assistance of the man to pull her in so I had one arm and he had another. I kept giving my mom warning as to when waves were coming so she could prepare herself and I also encouraged her to stand up when she was finally in a swallow point. My mom wasn\u2019t really able to follow my instructions here very clearly and people noticed there was something wrong and ran in and the man removed his gear, my moms, and I took mine off as well. A women came in and collected the gear from me and I saw a few people carrying my mom onto the beach as I wasn\u2019t strong enough to do so and people were worried about if I was ok. I remember people saying do you need us to call for help to my mom at which she declined but thankfully they ignored her and called anyway. I went to our stuff and was going to grab her a towel to dry off but then when I got over to her people told me they needed me to put it under her head for support. This is where I started getting freaked out a little more but I followed the instructions and my mom was still awake and I told her she was going to be ok and ran my fingers through her hair and then people told me to come with them so they could comfort me. This is the last time I ever had any form of exchange with my mom while she was conscious. From there a lady who was a registered nurse took her pulse and said she was ok and turned her on her side and said she had frothy sputum I think was the word, but seconds later I heard \u201cI need to start CPR.\u201d This is when I officially start losing my mind, however I was still hopeful. People were asking me questions about my mom and led me away so I didn\u2019t need to see what was going on and then from there paramedics and police arrived and asked me questions. The officer then drove me over to where we parked so I could retrieve our phones and her ID.  I called my sister and informed her what happened and he took us to where we were staying so we could get ourselves some overnight bags, more ID, my moms medications, and etc. Lots of stuff happened between that point and seeing my mom again that I feel can be skipped, but at this point I was informed that she was stable. As me and my sister are minors, we got transferred to a social worker who took us to the hospital and said we could visit our mother in the critical care unit. When we arrived we were told we couldn\u2019t go back still because my mom went into cardiac arrest again. About 8\u201410 minutes later we were told she was stable and could go back shortly. Walking in and seeing anyone in critical care is already really hard but it\u2019s so hard seeing a parent like that I can\u2019t even begin to explain. My moms condition continued to decline progressively throughout the night. They told us her brain was swelling from her blood pressures continuous drop and that they were beginning to exhaust their options. Because of how weak she was they were unable to do anything about relieving the pressure on her brain. I sat the rest of the night watching her condition decline as her blood pressure lowered and she finally quit breathing on her own and life support was only doing so for her. After around 11 or so hours in hospital with only about 1 hour slept, they told us they weren\u2019t going to revive her if something happened and then took her off life support. Me and my sister were all alone in another country being 16 (me) and 14 (sister). Right now we have now gotten family out here with us which has helped but I still can\u2019t get over the fact that I watched my mom die; both watching her physical body die and her conscious self. I really don\u2019t know how to manage right now and just want someone to talk to who has gone through loss of a loved one as well. This was totally unexpected for me, she had no previous health conditions and was totally fine all morning. I\u2019m sorry if this is a bit incoherent in anyway I\u2019m just so upset and panicked right now and I just can\u2019t sleep I just don\u2019t want to think about stuff and nothing is calming me down.

It is five thousand stages. \n\nIt is a worthless trip to the grocery store that you stop at because you don\u2019t want to go home, but the thought of cooking reminds you of the last thing you made for your person. So you buy laundry soap and coffee filters and try to forget about mashed potatoes and mushroom gravy.\n\nIt is being mad at new things. New movies, new music, new things in your life. Mad because your person would have loved those things. Or hated them. You can hear them saying, \u201cLet\u2019s go see that.\u201d or \u201cThat looks dumb.\u201d \n\nIt is feeling like you\u2019re drowning all the time. And being okay with it because you don\u2019t have the heart to try not to drown. \n\nIt is the internal argument you have with yourself to throw the pills away. Do not chase the high that won\u2019t actually help. You tell yourself that that is a rabbit hole you will not climb back out of so do not throw yourself down it headfirst. It\u2019s not worth it, you tell yourself again and again. \n\nIt is being scared to change. Scared to become someone that they didn\u2019t know. \n\nIt is being mad that you have this monumental, horrific reason to be mad. Mad at the tears that spring up when you least expect them. Mad that sometimes you forget, and then feeling guilty for forgetting. \n\nIt is seeing an ambulance and wanting to puke. \n\nIt is digging your heels in and willing time to stop because every day that passes puts you further from the last time you spoke to your person. The sun keeps setting though and it keeps rising and the days keep passing without your consent. \n\nBut grief is also love in one of it\u2019s purest forms. It is unrelenting and strong and overwhelming a lot of the time. But it is realizing that you will always love who you love...and loving that. Realizing that no one can steal that love from you. That it won\u2019t go away, or falter, and that you won\u2019t forget. \n\nIt is holding onto the idea that you won\u2019t always be drowning. That one day you will wake up and realize that your head is above water again, you might not be swimming yet but at least you\u2019re treading water. One day you will swim again. Maybe not today, or tomorrow, or next week or next month..but someday. \n\nIt is learning to be someone new, someone that will be forever changed but still someone that your person would love. \n\nIt is throwing yourself at the good that makes you smile, the memories, the laughter, the love. \n\nSo grief is five thousand stages. Five thousand brutal stages. Some days will be miserable. Some days will be okay. Some days will be almost normal. It won\u2019t be how it used to be, it will be different and new and hard. \n\nBut there is light down this path. Love yourself. Keep loving your person. There is life to be lived still, even on the days where it doesn\u2019t seem like it. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "subreddit": "GriefSupport"}

It\u2019s almost 3 am and all the grief I\u2019ve been holding in is just pouring out.\n\nLast March, a week before moving to another country to start a new life with me, my mom was diagnosed with breast cancer mets to the bones.\n\nShe had been feeling pain since 2017, but none of the doctors considered that possibility, even though she had breast cancer twice in the past. So when we got the last diagnose it was too late.\n\nI was living in the US and she was in Brazil, having my dad as her caretaker 24/7. The whole year was hell, none of the doctors were blunt about her condition, so we kept going as if she could beat it. None of them had the courage to tell us that she was terminal.\n\nI got there 3 weeks before she passed, by then she was mentally gone, lost her voice, and needed help eating, going to the bathroom, bathing. She was so off that she wouldn\u2019t even watch tv. My dad kept her condition on the down low in order not to worry me since I was a continent away. And getting there and seeing her condition was just numbing.\n\nDecember 23rd I held her hand and watched her fade away. I was able to whisper to her some last words without breaking down, 30 seconds later she was gone. I keep reliving that moment over and over again, I held her hand and stared at it for so long to keep the memory of what her hand felt like. Thinking how 6 months prior to that she was going to Zumba classes, studying to become a vet assistant, packing her bags. She had just turned 63 a week prior to her passing. And she had so much life in her.\n\nTo go through her stuff and seeing the boxes that she was going to send to her new home was just the most heartbreaking thing.\n\n Now I\u2019m living in a strange environment. I\u2019m beyond numb, and ever so often the grief hits so hard that I don\u2019t even know what to do with myself. She was my absolute best friend. I feel like cancer completely destroyed all of her hopes and dreams, and even her marriage (her and dad were still married, but had a horrible relationship ever since her first cancer when I was a toddler). She wasn\u2019t able to have more kids because of it, she was literally covered in scars due to the butchered mastectomy which destroyed her confidence, and now it took away her future. \n\nAs a daughter, and only child, this that I\u2019m going through had always been my greatest fear, and now I\u2019m living that nightmare. I wake up in the mornings and for a split second I forget about what happened, and then those seconds are gone and reality hits, and my body just automatically goes in to numb mode. I know I should be feeling it, but I think my brain just can\u2019t handle the loss.\n\nI also feel so betrayed, everyone talks about how they feel the lost ones, that they\u2019re still watching us, or that a coincidence happened and it might be them making themselves noticed. But none of that happened. Albeit being an atheist, I deep down inside hoped that I\u2019d feel that, but I don\u2019t. She passed, and she was gone. And it\u2019s horribly painful and maddening to not have that one connection to her.\n\nI\u2019m sorry if I\u2019m coming off so pessimistic. I am grateful that she survived it twice, and I was able to enjoy 31 years with her. But I think it\u2019s the anger that sometimes take over, and I just have no one to talk about this besides my therapist, which is only an hour a week. Talking to friends seems to put them down, and I\u2019d hate myself to be that kind of person thats is a sob story. I wouldn\u2019t even want to talk about it to my dad, he\u2019s already struggling enough not only with the grief, but now with loneliness. I have to be strong for him. We\u2019ve always had a bad relationship, but now we\u2019re bonding and building a wonderful father/daughter bond, but that is also overwhelming to me since for so long we barely spoke. \n\nSo here I am, letting it off my chest, but finding comfort in the fact that if you\u2019re here it\u2019s because you understand and empathize. It\u2019s as if once you lose someone so dear, you enter this parallel universe where you can only truly connect with others who went through that pain.\n\nI just miss her so very much.\n\n", "subreddit": "GriefSupport"}

I lost my mom very unexpectedly almost 4 weeks ago. I am an only child. We were very close and she was my best friend, so I've been a hot mess. I'm also a newlywed--my husband and I have been together for almost 5 years, but married for less than a year. I also have an anxiety disorder, which my mom was great at helping me manage.\n\nHere is my predicament: my husband has never experienced any kind of loss in his family (other than pets.) He still has all 4 of his grandparents at 32. Everyone in his family just kind of....does their own thing and occasionally intersect, so they're not really close. Given all of these things, he unfortunately has NO idea what I'm feeling, even though he is dealing with losing his mother-in-law as well. \n\nIf I'm going into a panic attack or just generally feeling sad and I start to cry, my husband tries his hardest to help and he just....doesn't. He says things that don't make sense to my brain at that moment, or things that make me more upset, and as much as I try to control it, I generally get more upset every time he tries to help. This leads to him getting frustrated and eventually yelling at me because whatever he's trying to do isn't helping. When I'm in this mode, the absolute LAST thing I need is to be yelled at, especially by literally the only person permanent in my world, and that makes me more upset and more anxious. It's a vicious cycle.\n\nDoes anyone have any advice for us? I love my husband with all my heart and I don't want losing my mom to also destroy my marriage, but I also don't want to be yelled at when I'm having panic attacks. Also if anyone has a better sub that I can post this on, please let me know. Thank you in advance.", "subreddit": "GriefSupport"}

I'm just having trouble giving up on the idea that my mother would embrace me doing good if I communicated to her what's going on with me. And there's an intricate chain of events which led to the current scenario but my father passing away 9 years ago led to a lot of compensation, denial and angry outbursts when things have been pushed to the Limit. I was 19 when he died of leukemia and I stepped up at my own potential expense naively. I worked instead of going to school and tried to be strong for younger siblings and my mother. My older sister is a meth addict and her daughter is like my younger sister who I want to protect. My younger brother was 14 when our father died. The hardest thing about processing somebody's death isn't how they're gone but how Dynamics change afterward. I went years not realizing that I was enabling everybody to proceed with their normal way of coping as if my father never left as I rigidly went back and forth from my roll to the role that my father played in his life. And I was enabled to do that even though it started to hurt me the same way it detrimented my father. But what made it worse for me is that even though my family wouldn't have survived as a unit without my compensation, they rejected me confronting the characteristics of this reality and making decisions that would stop the toxic cycle, even though no one else would do it. I should have left but i was entrenched in workaholism. I didn't know how to and my mother tempted me into being delusional about things working out if I were to just subject myself to the deflection and denial that she doesn't cope with. ( that last sentence had a hint of sarcasm). Anyway before I go off telling my life story Etc... The other night I called my mom asking her if she could have a conversation with me where we could make progress pleading with her that I just need some support from a parent. And she implied that if she didn't support me it was my fault and that I wasn't putting out the effort in making the choices that would help her support me. So I deducted that I am putting out effort and that's why we're talking and that I've explored my options... I can either be connected to you by compensating, which is synonymous with neglecting myself or I can stay neutral, giving you the benefit of the doubt that you would reach out to me or I can disconnect from you. And unfortunately staying neutral I'm still disconnected because you are afraid to reach out to me. And with either choice I put the effort out in the making I still feel pain from not being connected to a mother I love or neglecting myself in order to be connected to her.

I've known my fiance and his father for a little more than 3 years now. Whenever I saw him for birthdays or holidays he was always warm and welcoming. Suffice to say I don't know the man that well, but I was there to support my fiance in any way he needed while his father's health was declining. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhen I first met him he was a round, jolly man with a beard but due to the cancer he had been wasting away at an astonishing rate and had severe yellowing of the skin. He was up and walking around and mostly active until last week when he was put back into the hospital and subsequently sent home to be in hospice. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI arrived at his father's house and I was shocked. I hadn't seen him in about 3 months and he was a skeleton. It was so much worse than it had ever been before. I was not ready. He was not lucid and his breath was rattling in his throat - I thought it was a machine making the noise but it was his own chest. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI began to feel guilty about the internal complaining I'd been doing about having to even drive down there. My fiance never warned me about his state, hes a very stoic man and he doesn't break down very often so I never imagined it would be this bad. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe house was full of about 15 close family members, the people in our age group sat and played a board game in the other room to pass time while others sat with him, wandered around the house or watched tv quietly. It was so quiet in the house you could hear his rattling from anywhere.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThen his sister came and said his breathing was different. We all went to him and his breaths were coming very short. He would stop and then catch himself and take another breath. It was just the body, his eyes were blank and staring. His wife and his sister and everyone we all stood there and watched until he stopped breathing. It was heart wrenching to hear his sons and daughters crying when they realized he was gone. He was only 58.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe hospice nurse came and a little while later the morticians came and it was done. He was in a blanket on their rolling table and he was so small and empty. I stared at his face for a long time before they took him away so that I wouldn't be afraid of it in my memories. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBut then I had to leave the next morning because I can't get much time off of work. My fiance stayed with his family. The father requested that no funeral services be held, only a celebration of life. That was two days ago and I missed it because I didn't realize it was the official gathering, so I was at work. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOur home is 2 hours away from his family and he's been there all week. I don't have any friends or family in the area and I feel like I can't talk about this with my coworkers because its not appropriate. My fiance and I had a brief moment to talk about it when he came home the other day but I felt like I couldn't break down in front of him because I know he's in so much pain and I have to be strong and keep our home together.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI just feel like I'm on an island by myself and I don't know how to express my grief other than to cry. I saw a recent picture of him on facebook and it shocked me. I think about his face and his breathing when I'm trying to fall asleep. I barely knew him and I watched him die.

Just the three of us an an aunt, the one we all like. We haven't told anyone present that she's pregnant. We're barely out of the 1st trimester, and her relationship with her family is complicated and sometimes strained. She is having stabbing pains all through dinner and has been bleeding just a little- not so much we need to panic. A little bit can still be normal.   \nAfter dinner she is not just in pain, she's doubled over in agony and crying. I have to suggest the hospital then insist ont he hospital. She never wants to take care of herself. She's a tender, soft-hearted person and she hates confronting her problems, but it's time to go. The hospital is like hospitals always are. Cold, bored, absentee doctor and warm, sympathetic, nurses. To keep a long story short an imaging tech is the one who tells us that we have experienced \"fetal demise\". The doctor is nowhere. She tells us she can lose her job for giving us a diagnosis but she can't believe how the staff have been treating us. \n\nI need to tell you that it was bad. It was violent. She was in so much pain and blood was flowing from the time we arrived. When the ultrasound was done, the fetus, our baby, was already passing out of her body. We saw it for just a split second on the screen. She said \"That's your baby. I'm so sorry but there's no heartbeat.\"  After that he was gone. Maybe onto a piece of gauze on the table, maybe down the hospital toilet. We don't know for sure. It never bothered me where his remains ended up.   \nThat night, my wife cried from the pain but she didn't grieve yet. Neither did I. It was 5 in the morning by the time we got home. We were so exhausted. We talked all through it, we even made jokes, small talk. I held her hand when the pain came and told her to crush it as hard as she could to get through it. Which she did. My wedding band cut the fingers on either side. I loved it. I took just a little bit of her pain away. I wish I could have taken more. \n\nThe next day we woke up at a normal hour and had nothing in the house for breakfast. We went to the diner and got pancakes. I was up before her and at about 8 AM, I had quietly sent texts and emails to my mother, and our two best friends. The only people on Earth who knew about the baby. I told them \"She miscarried\". I would have felt stupid saying anything about \"the baby\". During lunch, Mom called and I told her we were OK. We're both OK, they were really nice to us at the hospital. She's doing fine, she's doing better than me. That was true then and it's still true now. \n\n  \nThe grief hit me later. Then it hit me again when we got a bill for $1000, then again when we got a second bill for $3000. Today we got a third bill for $1000. It's been two months and the wound was starting to close. It's open again now.   \n\n\nI called Mom and told her what happened. She told me everything would be OK. She told me a funny story and I laugh-cried hysterically. She told me if you two can't handle it, me and Dad can help you with the bills. They're not wealthy people. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFor a little while, I felt something that I would call a \"beautiful sadness\". This little thing that I loved so much was gone. And I had a hole in my heart. But when I grieved for him, I would feel bursts of ecstasy. Exhiliration, energy, a rush of pleasure. I don't know exactly why. Maybe just the feeling that I had loved something so much, and that something so beautiful had been in my life. Maybe relief that the worst pain was over, that I was recovering, that my wife was doing even better than me. Now the pain is dulled. I'm not feeling ecstatic anymore when I mourn him. It's becoming part of me and I'm OK with that.   \n\n\nI need to tell you that if he had lived we would have called him Ben. I loved him so much.

It means more than I can say in words that you loved me for only my weird little heart, because you were the first to do so. My life has not been easy, but you were one of the first to see past my imperfections and give me a chance, and helped me pick up the pieces and taught me to be better as a professional and as a person. You gave advice without judgement, and I could come to you for absolutely anything. You celebrated my victories, and were genuinely happy for me whenever I achieved what I had worked for, big or small. You stuck up for me, and made every effort you could to make my days bright. I hope I did that for you too. You wiped away my tears, hugged me often, told me you were proud of me, and shared in my warped sense of humor. I will never forget that laugh of yours, and all the laughs we shared together. Losing you hurt worse when I discovered you were truly a steel trap, and never spilled any of my secrets I had shared with you, and that you had always spoken fondly of me, even to your sister and friends I had never met. You were the very first, and only person who has never broken my confidence and I cherish that, and hopefully I can be that for others when I heal. I remember last summer when I was at a very dark time in my life that you told me I was smart, beautiful, and a wonderful person. You repeated it over and over, that I was amazing and anyone would be lucky to know me.  You told me I could do absolutely anything, and that I always deserve the best. I laughed when you said you wished you could pummel every person who had ever broken the light in me, beat me, abused me, and taken away a piece I can never get back, but the sentiment behind that statement was very sweet. You called me just to talk, and checked up on me every day for two weeks straight during that struggle and it helped get me back on track. When I had surgery, you told me not to be afraid and asked my dad for updates during, and enjoyed hours of hilarious conversation with me while I was on my pain medication. You genuinely cared about me, and I genuinely cared about you. Through all of the lessons you taught me and all of the things I will take with me the rest of my life, one lesson stood out the most. I fought love for a very long time after all I have been through, but you broke down those barriers and helped me rebuild and let go of so much pain. Platonic love is love, and I am thankful to have had such a deep and meaningful friendship with such a spectacular, kind, genuine person. I will miss you forever, and cherish you always. I love you.

I feel so lost and scared even though I would admit to it in real life. All the plans we made for our life were together. I don\u2019t even know how to start over making life plans without him. \n\nAny tips on how to figure that out would be really helpful. \n\nAnd I miss being held. Not even like sex or anything just being comfortable enough with a person to snuggle. My kids are young enough to sit in laps and cuddle, but it isn\u2019t the same. I know that I\u2019m not psychologically ready (if ever) for another relationship, but it\u2019s hard to miss physical contact. \n\nI guess that there is a lot here to speak to and I know there isn\u2019t a magic bullet for curing grief, but I just appreciate the chance to put it all down.

For some reason, it really freaked me out about ever losing any memories of my Mom, how many memories I can still remember now, and just how I can never create any new memories with her. It all came hitting me at once and I had to leave my friends I was watching with to go find a quiet place to cry/hyperventilate alone as I felt like my body was closing in and I got super claustrophobic. It's so strange how the most strange things can be triggers and especially when they're movies or tv shows.

How do I deal with this overwhelming sense of loss &amp; 2.) How do I write a condolence letter?\n\nThis past weekend I learned that one of my best friends from when I was younger died from a health related complication.\n\nI dont know if background is needed but me and M have been friends since preschool, we lived on the same block and I saw her almost every day for years. She moved schools sophomore year to live with her dad but we kept in touch and saw each other when we were both in town. M was such an instrumental part of my childhood and she was always someone I felt like I could be completely genuine and myself with. Ive never really dealt with death before with the exception of an older family member but they were old and sick. She was so strong and stubborn and she didnt even make it to 20. M always seemed so invincible and now shes gone and I dont really know how to deal with her absence in the world. When I go out everything reminds me of her and I have spent the last 2 days crying. Ive just been thinking about her and all the time we spent together and I should have had years with her and now shes dead and Ill never see her again. I didnt even find out until like 10 days after. I found out she had died from a mom's friends who called because she had seen her in the obituary. The cause of death was not listed and I found out earlier today it was because of a longstanding medical condition. She always had such a handle on it tho and she had it since we were like 10. Im alternating between being furious, crying and emptiness.\n\nI always got along well with her mom and I want to send her a condolence letter or text. I have tried writing some out but they all seem to end up focusing on my grief instead of addressing her loss. I have also tried to look up templates but they all seem so impersonal and distant. I dont want her mom to feel any worse then I am sure she does already but I want to reach out in someway. How do you reach out to a grieving mom? Does she want to hear about M? Just to know that I loved her? That Ill always miss her? Or would that only make her feel worse?\n\ntl:dr I dont know how to cope with the death of a friend and this overwhelming grief and I would like advice on how to write to her mom", "subreddit": "GriefSupport"}

He had been involved with drugs and getting into trouble his entire adult life, so in a way I always expected him to die young. But that doesn\u2019t mean I was prepared for it. \n\nHe was 35 years old. He had settled down with a nice, down-to-earth girl and was finally getting his life together. His future was looking bright. One cold night, he and his girlfriend got into an argument so he left to the gas station on foot to get cigarettes. He never came back. They found him the next day in the park. For better or worse, I never got to see the coroner\u2019s report. The official story was that he had been drinking, fell asleep in the park, and died of exposure. Regardless of what may or may not have been in his system, my older brother died outside, in the cold, in the dark, alone. \n\nIt\u2019s a strange grief, because he and I were never very close. He was quite a bit older than me, and had a different mom, so he wasn\u2019t always around. I certainly looked up to him, and desperately wanted him to think I was cool. I\u2019ll never know if he did, but he did buy me a Misfits CD for my birthday one year, and gave me some of his old band t-shirts, so I was at least worthy of that.\n\nThe grief tends to sneak up on me, usually at work when I let my mind drift. Probably doesn\u2019t help that I have a photo of him hanging in my office cubicle. I can\u2019t help but cry. I wish he would have had a chance at a better life. I wish we could attend each other\u2019s future weddings, meet each other\u2019s future kids, or even just smoke a bowl and listen to some music together. It doesn\u2019t seem fair that he will never get those opportunities. He\u2019s just fucking gone, and I\u2019ve never felt more helpless. There\u2019s no wish I could make that would make him come back. It\u2019s so final.\n\nI really don\u2019t know how I feel about the afterlife or supernatural stuff. It would be nice to believe for sure, but that doesn\u2019t make it real. But last night something weird did happen and I want so bad to believe it was him. \n\nGoing back a little bit, at his funeral all of the immediate family got to keep a flower from his casket. I dried mine out and put it in a shoe box with a few other mementos, including his obituary, some pictures of him, and an old Christmas ornament of his. Well, my boyfriend and I just moved, so everything has kind of been everywhere for the past few weeks. Turns out, my boyfriend packed up the remainder of my closet without asking me, which included the shoebox. When I was organizing some stuff last night, I noticed the box on top of a pile of stuff, open, with the contents spilling out onto the floor. I gathered everything back up but realized the flower was missing.\n\nI felt horrible. My brother is gone forever, and now the most important little symbol from his funeral was gone forever, too. I was mad at my boyfriend for being so careless with my stuff, but was also trying to convince myself that it was just a stupid flower that didn\u2019t actually mean anything. I kept thinking about how it probably ended up on our garage floor, and all the people that were coming in and out of there as we were moving things into the house. I could go out and look for it, but there was no way it wasn\u2019t destroyed through all that.\n\nAfter a while I decided it was finally time to go to bed. I took one more pass around where I had found the spilled box, and THERE IT WAS. I\u2019m sure it had been there the whole time and I just hadn\u2019t looked hard enough, but in that moment I was too relieved to feel stupid about it. I happily turned out the lights and went to the kitchen to clear up the rest of the dishes. As I\u2019m doing this, the light from the other room (that I had JUST turned off) popped on. I crept over there to see what the deal was, since my boyfriend was already upstairs in bed... no one was there except for my cats, who definitely don\u2019t know how to turn on lights.\n\nMaybe it\u2019s dumb, but I still kind of feel like it means something. It was just weird enough and the timing was right enough that I was mildly convinced. I would really like to believe that he\u2019s somehow watching over me.\n\nAnyway, sorry for the long post, and thanks for letting me vent.

I just needed somewhere to write this down.  \nMy mom passed away yesterday.  I was with her until her last breath.  I don\u2019t really think that made a difference to her, but I am still glad I was with her.  \n\nWe had a difficult relationship as a child.  For her, life was about power and control and I was the child who stood up to her.  I resented her need to control me and fought back.  This occasionally escalated into violence. Sometimes I would stand up to her and knew I was risking her losing control, but I would feel she was so unfair and unreasonable and I just couldn\u2019t bring myself to submit.  She had a tone of voice that implied she was going to win, because she was willing to go to the mat about it.  But so many of the things she was willing to fight about were trivial.  Or things that I could not have realized were going to set her off.  She was unpredictable, and so my brother and I sometimes had to walk on eggshells.  \n\nThat\u2019s one part of my mother.  The other part of my mother was that she did love us both. Very much.  She did put our health and welfare above her own.  Even when we were dirt poor she made sure we had healthy food to eat.  She taught me the value of hard work and she taught me to serve my community. And in so many ways that I am proud of, I am a lot like her. We were very poor when I was a kid, but in my teens she went to law school.  So as an adult my mom had money. And she was generous with the money.  She was my safety net.  When I got divorced, she was the one who pulled me through the grief, and quietly worked behind the scenes to protect my financial interests in ways that I simply couldn\u2019t handle because I was so broken hearted.  (She convinced me to divorce quickly while he was still in the affair fog and he signed away his rights to my pension.  I didn\u2019t even realize that was happening, but years later I am so grateful she had my back. He took enough from me. I would have been pissed for him to get one penny of my pension.) She also told the best stories.  I could sit for hours and talk with her and listen to her stories.  \n\nBoth of these people were my mother.  By the time she was diagnosed with her second bout of cancer I had made peace with the fact that she was both women, and I could forgive her on my own for the chaos of my childhood. Because in the end, I believed she did the best she could.  \n\nUnfortunately, the cancer amplified her anger and her rage.  She was angry, unpredictable, and just plain mean.  The disease progressed fast and it was a horror show in regards to her behavior. And I resented that I didn\u2019t get to see that second woman.  I was angry at her, and I was angry at the disease for doing this.  I wished for it to end soon, and then felt terrible for wishing for her death.   I stopped going to see her, because I couldn\u2019t handle her venom.  A few weeks ago, my brother called me because he didn\u2019t think she was safe and he couldn\u2019t get her to agree to help.  I drove down to help. It was awful.  She was manic and irrational. She was screaming in pain, but wouldn\u2019t let us help.  She refused to rest and as a result was making herself sicker.  Her hospice nurse tried to get her to take anti-anxiety meds, she wouldn\u2019t.  Her nurse also believed that she needed more medical attention than could be delivered at home.  But my mom refused. \n\nI won\u2019t lie.  I lost it.  I was exhausted because I had driven 6 hours the day before to place her parrots in a good home.  That in itself was stressful as it took her hours to focus enough to give me the things I needed to take with the birds and I got back to her house very late.  I had been woken up with her screaming at 5 am, when I went to help she just yelled at me and was abusive.  I was exhausted and I couldn\u2019t escape the verbal abuse.  We got in a fight.  And because she couldn\u2019t get me to shut up she called 911.  Yes, folks my mother called the police on me.  Those poor guys, they were so confused.  She was claiming elder abuse, which obviously there was none.  (Turns out being pissed at your mother for being irrational is not actually a crime. ) In the end I was so angry and upset that I decided I was leaving. That was it, I couldn\u2019t do anything more for her and I couldn\u2019t handle the emotional abuse.  \n\nHowever, that big emotional release actually settled her down, and she became very contrite.  (It was a pattern in the later years of her life.  She would be nasty, I would get angry and walk out.  She would sort of apologize, but definitely feel bad after the fact, and then things would be better.  We could go a year without a big blow up.)\n\nSo instead of leaving, I told her that if she would go to hospice so they could get her properly medicated and take care of her wounds, then I would stay and help move her in.  (She planned to stay in the assistive living portion of the hospice.  It was a nice place, and she had picked it out a couple of months earlier when she was initially diagnosed.) I did move help her move in.  And then I left and I didn\u2019t go back. I could have gone the next weekend, but I was still emotionally traumatized from the previous week.  I was exhausted and I knew that she was still out of control, and I knew I couldn\u2019t handle it.  She actually ended up calling 911 on the hospice facility convinced they were poisoning her.  And wouldn\u2019t allow anyone to come in her room to preserve the \u201ccrime scene.\u201d  They actually had to have police come in and take \u201cevidence\u201d to get her to calm down.  \n\nAnd then her best friend called.  They had mom sedated and now all she was doing was sleeping.  There was the feeling that this was the end.  \n\nSo I drove down and from Wednesday to Sunday I stayed by her bedside.  She wasn\u2019t angry anymore, although she was very restless.  She kept wanting to sit up, which the hospice people didn\u2019t think was safe.  I was able to help, because I just started to sit with her, when she wanted up and supported her. And then help her lay down when she was ready. We could have done that 20 times that day, because she was demonstrating Terminal restlessness.  She was having beautiful hallucinations where she saw colors that she described as \u201cnice\u201d and \u201clovely\u201d.  I told her I loved her and she told me she loved me too.   \n\nThe next day, she didn\u2019t try to get up but she did keep kicking her leg off the bed trying to stretch her hip.  At this point she wasn\u2019t saying much and was mostly out of it, unless she was in pain.  Again, there was something I could do.  Each time she kicked her leg off the bed, I caught it and held it so she could stretch it without falling off the bed.  \n\nSaturday and Sunday I just kept vigil. There wasn\u2019t much to do.  She didn\u2019t wake up.  And while I didn\u2019t have my long conversation I at least got time to sit with her.  I stayed with her until her last breath.  \n\nI feel so many confusing emotions. I miss her.  But I am also relieved.  I am relieved because she isn\u2019t in pain,  but I am also relieved because she isn\u2019t causing other people pain. And I am relieved because having a relationship with her was a lot of work on my part, and I no longer have to do the work.  \n\n", "subreddit": "GriefSupport"}

I have experienced the death of old people, but never someone young who I knew firsthand. Recently, a person at the high school I graduated from was suddenly killed in a car crash and wasn't even driving recklessly. This person was in the grade below me and we worked together for 3 years and talked a couple times. We weren't close by any means whatsoever, but now I am obsessing over his death. I can't stop thinking about him and his death. I thought I had grips on my mortality and that of other people, but I guess that crumbles when applied to young people when it actually happens. I can't stop thinking about his body being thrown around and all the pain he felt. I think about his mother finding out. \nI now feel unmotivated to do anything like my homework or studying because what's preventing me from dying the second I graduate and why should I waste my time with unpleasant things when I have no guarantee of a reward or no idea how long I'll live.

I keep coming close to crying or  having a moment and then it goes away. \n\nI have a lot of guilt because I feel like I could have done something to help him before this even started. He called me like two weeks before he went into the hospital. Then I was going to spontaneously go over to his house, after I went to the dentist, the Friday before he went into the hospital. I didn't call him back when he called and I skipped going over to check in with him because I felt like shit after the dentist. If I would have gone over that Friday I would have known something was wrong and gotten him to the hospital sooner. On a fundamental level I know that there's probably nothing I could have done and that it's stupid to feel guilty, but I can't help myself at the moment. ", "subreddit": "GriefSupport"}

Of course when it first happened it was devastating and heart breaking. I was emotionally damaged for two years. After two years is when I began feeling again and find pieces of myself. Now 5 years after his death I don\u2019t think much about him anymore, the pain isn\u2019t there like it once was. This is not to say I won\u2019t be missing him for the rest of my life; he was my first love, a beautiful person, and he is the reason why I am who I am today- the one who opened my heart up to the world. \n\nI have been dating someone for a year and a half now, and I do believe he is the one. The one thing holding me back is that I don\u2019t know if he can accept my past with my late boyfriend, like I so desperately need him to. I have only really talked to him about my late bf once, when we first started dating (because he had asked me about my last relationship). He reacted in a kind and supportive manner. However after that we had got into an argument because his friends were doing cocaine and I had told him I wouldn\u2019t want him going near it (I don\u2019t do drugs and obviously having lost someone close to me to drugs makes me afraid of anyone I love ever doing them) anyway he got upset and downplayed cocaine and said \u201cyou dated someone who did heroin. Do you know how fucked up that is? How the hell did you even meet people who do that shit etc etc\u201d he basically made me feel guilty and attacked me for my past. Since then I have not brought up my late bf ever. A couple times after that when we\u2019d get into fights, he would say he is my second choice because my late bf died. We haven\u2019t had fights like this in almost a year, because I am sure to never talk about my late bf or my grief or my past. Though we have more recently gotten into fights about me keeping a relationship with my late bf\u2019s best friend. Me and my late bf\u2019s best friend went through something so traumatic together. Something most people can never comprehend. We have shared pain and keeping a relationship with him (we go out for dinner once a year) helps me to keep my late bf\u2019s memory and spirit alive, and is cathartic for me. We do not even talk about my late bf when we are together, we mostly just catch up and we find happiness in seeing each other thriving. My bf almost considers this relationship \u201ccheating.\u201d He considers our dinners \u201cdates.\u201d For the record I have never been romantic with this friend, the thought has never even crossed my mind. We are simply supportive friends who love the same person who is missing from our lives. He doesn\u2019t understand why I need to see my late bf\u2019s bestfriend. He will make rude comments about him. I haven\u2019t seen or reached out to this friend because I am avoiding a fight between me and my boyfriend. I also have stopped seeing my late bf\u2019s parents (I was close with them and he was their only child so I would go over around Christmas time to bring them a gift and catch up). My boyfriend is so loving and caring and supportive in every other aspect of my life. I don\u2019t know what to do. I know he must be insecure in some way for him to be acting this way. Any advice? Should I be giving up this relationship with my late bfs best friend out of respect for my current bf because it makes him uncomfortable/insecure? Am I being selfish here?\n\nShouldn\u2019t I be able to talk about an important part of my past with the person I love? Shouldn\u2019t I have his compassion and support? I don\u2019t know anyone who has lost a bf or gf so I have no one to relate to. I\u2019m hoping someone on here can relate to me. \n\nI love my boyfriend, I just don\u2019t want to be ashamed of my past. I feel like I have to hide a part of myself or pretend my late bf never existed, which kills be because celebrating his memory, seeing his friends and family, is the only way to keep him alive; make his life mean something.

I feel like I\u2019ve been grieving her for years, because she battled with dementia for a very long time, and it developed into Alzheimer\u2019s. In the past two years, she broke both hips, and she definitely worsened after that. So this was very expected, but has been extremely difficult, since we were really close.

He remortgaged our house without telling us to fund himself, he constantly begged her for money and if she found the strength (from me begging her/screaming at her) to say no he\u2019d punish her by behaving so sadly around the house the guilt would kill her. \n\nIt was a constant conversation for her and I to leave, move abroad, move to another city, just get out of this cycle that was making her feel so stuck and crappy so we could be happier. I was just to graduate college, get some REAL money (she worked her fingers to the absolute bone for such a small salary :( ), and her and I could so easily live - she probably wouldn\u2019t have even had to work. And then she died right before I graduate college in a few months. \n\n\nI can\u2019t help but feel so upset all the time about this inside. I\u2019m so angry with him. I dream about the life she would have had if she met someone better. I wouldn\u2019t even mind if I wasn\u2019t here (I would never have been here to miss it anyways lol). She always said the only good thing that came from them was me. \n\n\nBut even after all this speech..we were a family. And even though the romantic love got violently smothered to death by all his s###, I know in my heart that family love was there between them. Hence why she was so giving all her life. She would have done anything for him, she felt responsible for him. \n\nSo. What now for me? I love my Dad. I\u2019m an only child. He\u2019s all I have. And I don\u2019t want to upset him with my anger - I\u2019m sure the guilt kills him every day anyways, he doesn\u2019t need me to kick him when he\u2019s down about things he\u2019s screwed up in his life. He\u2019s a grown old man, I\u2019m sure he already know. But I just don\u2019t know what to do with all this anger. Soon I start counselling so I 100% will offload the ENTIRE story, all the horrible bits I\u2019ve left out and all, to them because they definitely won\u2019t tell anyone. Other than that, I just don\u2019t trust anyone with my close family secrets. \n\n\nI just feel alone. I miss my mum, my rock my friend my person. I feel like I\u2019m just by myself now and then I feel so angry (and rightly f###ing so) but so guilty for that anger and for the times once in a while where it does bubble up and I\u2019m a bit harsh with him. It\u2019s particularly tense because we\u2019re handling her finances now and after all the f###ing financial MESS he\u2019s dragged us through OVER MY DEAD BODY will I allow all she has left to be f###ing drained away on his debt. You must be joking. \n\nBut then I worry....if I am financially strict with him how I always wished my mum was. What if he gets so upset or annoyed he does something bad? He\u2019s already lonely, old, not many friends and dealing with the bereavement of his life partner who he knows in his soul deserved 5000 times better than him. But at the same time, those are his mistakes, and as long as I maintain our loving happy relationship the best I can I\u2019m not being manipulated. \n\n\nI\u2019m just alone, sad and in a f###ing mess right now. What the hell. I don\u2019t know what advice I am seeking really, sorry. \n\nEdit: I guess what I want advice on is managing these feelings. Of course I\u2019ve always been annoyed with him for his actions, but now she\u2019s gonna I feel sad it\u2019s all she ever knew and I never got to look after her and just give her the life of calm, happiness and joy I always felt she deserved. It\u2019s not his fault she died, it\u2019s noones fault, but still. Also apologies for how I swear oh no ", "subreddit": "GriefSupport"}

I know it will be incredibly emotionally draining and difficult, but I think the work will be the most fulfilling thing I do. I hope I can bring the person and their loved ones as much comfort as I can in those last moments.\n\nI also volunteered to be a cuddler in the NICU and think it will be an illuminating experience to be involved in both the beginning and end of life.", "subreddit": "GriefSupport"}

God I miss him so much.\n\nHere's a few pics of him. [https://imgur.com/a/XvC2T06](https://imgur.com/a/XvC2T06)\n\nIt was his 3rd Christmas in a row in the hospital - he was there for two months the last time, 8 month total in 2018.\n\nHe's with my mother, and a lot of Christmas cards. I had asked my facebook friends to bring Christmas to him, since he couldn't be home for Christmas. He received cards from all over the place: US, Canada, Belgium, France. Over a hundred cards in total. I'm glad he had a little something special for his last Christmas.\n\nThe second picture his him trying on clothes for my wedding. He had told me he didn't need new clothes, but I brought him out. He wound getting a few items, this shirt being his favorite of the bunch. I have it now. Will wear it someday I guess.\n\nThe bottom left one, it's us, on a typical early 80's weekend morning. He never said no to playing horsie with me. My biggest regret in life - and I cannot blame myself, since I'm infertile, but still - is not giving him any grandkids. He'd have been the best grandpa ever.\n\nLast one is with my late dog, that he loved very much. My mom didn't want any pets, but they would dogsit him whenever I needed. He loved that dog so much - didn't want me to pay for surgeries, treated him with lots of food (Moe would gain weight everytime he'd stay at my parents for longer periods...). He was as sad as me, if not more, when Moe passed a few years ago.\n\nIt's been 6 weeks...Everyday has its challenges. Most days I don't want to work, but I still go to the office or work from home - my managers and colleagues are super understanding. Playing music doesn't bring me joy anymore, at least now. Only thing that takes my mind of everything is playing volleyball, as I need to be in the moment all the time.\n\nI lost my best bud, my mentor, my advisor, my biggest fan, the man who sacrificed its own happiness for mine, who went to great lengths to make sure I would have a great life.\n\nI miss him. I miss calling home or the hospital, hearing his voice on the phone. \"Hello\" he would say. \"Hi it's me!\" I'd answer. He'd say \"Hello\" again, this time with a longer last syllable, his voice raising ever so slightly in pitch, having recognized me. With just this, I knew I had made his day. And that made up mine, all the time, whichever mood I was in.\n\nBut now life moves on without him.\n\nI still have all the memories that we shared. It's just that I won't make new ones.\n\nI won't be able to tell him about that trip to Berlin that my wife and I are going to make for her 40th birthday.\n\nWon't get the chance to show him our upcoming  NYC trip pictures and hear tell me for the hundredth time about that day his boss called him and told him to get his ass to the airport at 7 am the next day, to fly in to NYC, go to a convention, spend almost a million dollars on equipment for the company, eat the best steak ever and fly back after dinner.\n\nI'm just going to think about it. Put everything I'm experiencing through that lens, thinking \"dad would've reacted that way.\"\n\nI loved that man. I still do. I wish I could tell him once more.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;", "subreddit": "GriefSupport"}
