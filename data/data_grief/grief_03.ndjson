I've been dreading this day for ages, but nothing could've prepared me for it. \n\nShe passed away on Tuesday before I got there, and when I did she was still in the hospital room and she was awful to see, her mouth was wide open and she had a massive bruise on her head.

Any advice?", "author": "queenjaninejaheen", "self_text": "It's been over a year since a former high school classmate of mine, Elizabeth, was murdered by her ex-boyfriend, the father of her son. She had only been free of their physically abusive relationship for less than a month before she was killed. We weren't necessarily the closest of friends, but she treated me with kindness, the way she treated everyone, and her life left an indelible impression on my own. My admiration for her was deep and immovable. Her loss hit me hard. For the longest time, a world without Elizabeth felt impossibly unfair and dark, and knowing that her toddler-aged son would never grow up alongside his mother was another form of cruelty and despair of its own. I attended the memorial. I sent the family my condolences, a box of diapers, and as much financial support I could offer for being 19-years-old and in college. Then, I grieved alone, pushing the nightmare away when I could and collapsing into myself when I couldn't.\n\nThree months ago, at the anniversary of her death, I visited the cemetery where she's buried, and I encountered Elizabeth's mother and her son as they were leaving. I told her I'd be going to law school soon after I graduated, and I wanted to concentrate my legal studies into advocacy and activism to honor Elizabeth's legacy. She was touched, and we exchanged information before going our separate ways again. \n\nTonight, she linked me the information regarding the date and time of the upcoming murder trial this month. My stomach sank. \n\nFor the first time in the grieving process, I am filled with fear. Not despondency, not agony, not rage like I've felt now for more than a year. I know that the state has overwhelming evidence to convict, but the prospect of seeing the evidence up-close, sitting mere feet from the person who killed Elizabeth, and reliving the whole incident in detail is obviously frightening. It's important to me that I am able to do this, both as support her family and as a budding legal scholar and victim's advocate. I feel like I *need* to experience this to honor Elizabeth, and I want her justice to be the moment I keep in the forefront of my mind when I enter every courtroom afterward as a victim's advocate and then an attorney.\n\nIf you've been in my shoes before, first of all, I offer my condolences. Second, how did you feel leading up to the trial? What do you wish you would've known ahead of time? Did you feel that the trial was in any way re-traumatizing? I want to know what to expect in the courtroom, sure, but I'm also anxious to know how it will affect my heart and where it will leave me in the grieving process.", "subreddit": "GriefSupport"}

In September 2018, he was going to surgery to get another stint placed in his stomach for a gastric bypass  or something like that. When he returned home from the hospital, he was very loopy and my entire family was arguing against him that day because we were scared of how much he changed. So over the weekend, me and my brother went out of town and apparently my mom did the same. My dad was home alone all weekend.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhen we returned, we discovered that he has been throwing up all weekend and it got all over the bed, floor, clothes, etc. We were freaking out, but he said he was fine. To make the matters worse, he became very religious out of nowhere. He wouldn't talk to us, only his religious friend from work or \"god\". Finally after many arguments and break down, he came back to his senses and decided it was time to go to the hospital because he was puking black stuff.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI helped my mom take him to the car and we left for the hospital. Long story short, he had stage 4 cancer and stayed in the hospital until November. During this whole time, keep in mind that we was continually throwing up, so they connected a hose through his nose straight to his stomach so the vomit could leave the body in a more peaceful manner and he hasn't eaten any food because he will immediately puke it back out, so he was dropping weight like crazy. He was 260lb before all this and he ended up being 120lb at the end.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnyways in October, he was finally able to come back home, but he has to be tied down to this machine that keep draining out the puke from his nose. He was bedridden the entire time and he was extremely weak. The only nutrients he could get was food bag that would connect to his IV. I was 18 at the time and I had to immediately grow up. My mom was is full team nurse at the house. She's been with him this entire time, even in the hospitals. She's so strong and amazing.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFinally on November 30 at 7:42PM , I got the call from my brother saying he didn't have much time. Earlier that day, he was moaning incredibly loud and I could tell he was in agonizing pain. His eyes were looking 10 miles down the way and he wasn't responding to any of us. We decided to put him on hospice and we had everything planned, but he was ready that same night. I was on a date with my girlfriend because everyone told me I need some time away. I've been missing classes and sleep helping my mom caught up on sleep and making sure my dad was comfortable. Of course, the one night I have off, it was the night he was about to leave. I missed the final goodbye and when I arrived home, everyone was already there.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe service was on December 7, My birthday was December 30. He was cremated and buried with his parents in the same cemetery.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow tonight, I've been crying and mourning for him. I felt like I was doing alright. I'm going to college classes, my relationship with my girlfriend is going good and due to life insurance, we don't have to worry about money as much... but still.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI feel empty, lost, alone, scared and I miss him dearly. My mom is handling everything okay. She went back to work and is currently about to move out of the house to a bigger city for a \"change in scenery\". My brother is back at work and he seems fine. Still going to concerts and traveling, but me... After my college classes, I get home at 3pm and it's just quiet at the house. I'm by myself until 9pm when my mom comes home. During this time, I try to study or play games and I make dinner for the family but I just feel so empty. I wake up thinking about my dad the past 2 days. It automatically made me depressed and lost motivation. Also, bless my girlfriend's heart. She's trying her best, but she doesn't understand what it means to lost a father that's only 48. I miss him dearly and I love him with my whole heart.", "subreddit": "GriefSupport"}

I myself have never spoken about this until today. However, for my own sake, and maybe for the victims family........there can be some information and maybe some closure, if that is possible.   \n\n\nAugust 15th, 2015 was like any other day. I had just ended my shift as an Armed Security Officer, the same job I've now had for 15 years. It was a beautiful day, my partner and I had even noticed the orange/red sunrise over the horizon as we packed up our gear before heading out. I returned to the small apartment of my sibling, Connor Shane Maccalister of Saco Maine to take a nap, before i headed out for a double shift a few hours later........but the events of that day would transform many lives for the worse.....and none of us knew except for Connor.  \n\n\nConnor was born as my sister, Tanisha Hopkins. We were 14 months apart in age, her being older. We grew up.....well, poor. My mother was a Vista Volunteer. A community organizer if you will. She helped low income families receive services, help, and gain independence. Later on she was a treatment-level foster parent. However neither job provided much in the way of pay. So yeah, we grew up quite poor......but Connor and I didn't notice. Connor was my best friend........we had each other.   \n\n\nSometime around high school Connor got into drugs. Started with pot, and drinking.........and somewhere, I don't know where....more serious drugs. Pills.....and eventually heroin.   \n\n\nAround this time Connor \\*at the time Tanisha\\* decided that she wanted to be a male, or was a male, or thought she was a male.....i don't know because she went back and forth for years........this time was the downfall of my sibling.   \n\n\nConnor became obsessive, watching movies like American History X on repeat for months, trainspotting, obsessions with Sid vicious......and other heroin addicts. I guess to Connor it was a connection to people like him.......or maybe not. Soon Connor became paranoid, the drugs were clouding Connors brain, frying it.....slowly. He would run into my room in a panic, and then show me the ball end of a guitar string......truly believing it was a listening device planted in his room so the neighbors could spy on him. Try as I might to explain it was a guitar string......Connor wasn't really there anymore.   \n\n\nI tried my best to help Connor, my family wouldn't listen, My mother, Grandparents, Sister, Aunts and cousins refused to believe Connor was a Heroin addict. They called me a liar, dismissed my worries and acted as nothing was wrong, but I kept trying to help Connor, even going as far as physically threatening local dealers to get them to stop selling to Connor. it worked for a while. Connor couldnt get it, so he stole robotussen, and other drugs from Supermarkets.   \n\n\nYears later Connor became obsessed with Brandon Novak and Bam Margera of TV's Jackass......so much so that he sold all of his possessions and disappeared. Vanished without a trace.......through Law Enforcement contacts I was able to track down that he had bought a bus ticket to Westchester PA.......to find Bam and Brandon.......which.......he did. Even had photos of them at a local pub together, and Brandon even gave Connor a leather jacket. However the fun lasted only a few days until the cravings took over and Connor ended up in Baltimore. A Heroin addict turning tricks under the name \"Angel\" to support an expensive habit. This went on for almost 6 months.   \n\n\nEventually Connor came home and I tried one last time to save him. I tried to get him clean....even through multiple overdoses, one that almost Killed him ending up with him in the ICU at Boston Hospital for a month. Eventually it worked. Connor was clean..........My family still refused to believe the truth of Connors past. But I had my sibling back and for a while..........life was good. Connor decided to fully transition to a male and started Testosterone treatment and seemed happy. I was happy for Connor, or ...what was left of him.   \n\n\nJuly 12th 2014, my Mother suddenly passed away from Septic Shock. I knew Connor would take it hard. My mother was Connors rock, Connor was extremely dependent on her. But he seemed to cope well, and after time......Life went on.  \n\n\nAugust 19th........2015......we're back on this day. The sun was out, it was warm......breezy. I just got to Connors. He came out of his bedroom, everything was normal. Connor asked me for $5......he wanted to go to the supermarket up the road \\*something he did daily\\* and get a candy bar and a bottle of Mt. Dew. I gave it to him and said I was going to nap.....i had been up for 20 hours. He left and I laid on the couch. Didn't even take off my duty belt, my gun or my kevlar vest. I was exhausted......  \n\n\nAround 3pm...I think. Its still foggy to me. A knock at the door woke me. Still groggy I walked to the front door and looked through the peep hole. A Saco Police Officer stood outside, which given my line of work was not a rare occurrence, a familiar face, a friend. I opened the door cheerfully tired and said \"heeeeyyyy whats up!\". The look in her eyes was that of someone who didn't want to do something, but was forced to anyway. I asked her what was wrong and I saw her swallow hard.......\"Jay, you need to gather your things, and exit the apartment. Now......the state police are coming with a search warrant\".....Had it not been for her face.......I'd have thought it was a joke......WHY........I asked. Again a hard swallow, WHY again I asked. Whats going on!?......\"I can't tell you, active investigation, you know.....I can't tell you\".......I demanded..........WHY IS THERE A WARRANT!?.........\"look at the news jay\" is all I got.   \n\n\nI walked into the kitchen and typed the local news station into facebook.......FACEBOOK...........\"Local woman killed at Shaws Supermarket\". I almost threw up, She was at my house, there was a warrant......Connor who was legally a female had gone to shaws........my sister was dead......I thought. \"Connor is dead!?\" I asked........Meghan said \"Connor? no.......Connor is in Custody........wait, the victim is dead!? OH MY GOD I DIDN'T KNOW SHE DIED...JAY........\".  \n\n\nWorse than Connor dying........Connor had Murdered someone......I hit the ground. It was like my legs were kicked straight out from under me. I dont even remember the feeling of my knees smashing into the tile floor, or the skin splitting open when they did. I could breathe........My sibling my........best friend. Murdered someone......Through the tears I read the article \"Elderly woman stabbed to death at Shaws, Saco Resident Connor Maccalister in custody\".  \n\n\nShaking, blurry, gritting my teeth so hard one actually cracked. I slowly dragged myself to my feet, grabbed my coat, laptop a few other things and somberly walked outside. More cops. All my friends, looking at me with pity, holding back reporters with microphones. I made it to my car....I drove away. I dont remember much past that other than my boss calling me......the rest is blank. Maybe i repressed the rest, the feelings, the guilt........the hatred for my own sibling and my thoughts in those moments. I just dont remember them. As if they were never there, although I know they were..  \n\n\nWendy Boudreau , 59 A grandmother of 5.......was dead. Connor had planned on murdering many people for weeks in secret. He planned to kill one, take another hostage and then kill that hostage when the police arrived......but I guess he decided that wouldn't work. So He had went to Shaws Supermarket, and waited. He saw Wendy in the parking lot, and targeted her because she was old and could not fight back. He followed her to the ice cream isle, pulled out MY knife he had stolen and cut her throat. Connor did not know Wendy, they had never met. However I did. Wendy was an amazingly friendly and kind woman. She lives 1 street over from Connor and I had seen her and talked with her many times. She was gone and Connor was the reason why.   \n\n\nI don't know why Connor did what he did. I cannot give that answer. He was not a violent person....ever. A drug addict, paranoid and afraid yes but Violent no.... I don't know why he did what he did. I never will never know.....only he will. But I will never forgive him.   \n\n\nI've lost my family over that. They want me to forgive, want me to forget. Want me to pretend it didn't happen. He almost died in prison last year, I didnt even go to the hospital when he was on a ventilator......I wont forgive. I can't.  \n\n\nI've devoted my life to protecting people like Wendy, from people like Connor. His actions go against everything I've ever believed in...........I stll cry for wendy. I still pray for her and her family, her face still enters my dreams. I still wake up in a cold sweat with images of Connors face. I still choke up any time I drive past that store, or the house he lived in.   \n\n\nPersonally, its taken a toll...on me. My family lives their lives in normalcy, like it never happened. Me.......I lost my home, my friends, my family, my fiancee.....and a large part of my soul over it. I blame myself, I know it wasn't my fault but i cant help but blame myself for not being there, for not happening to be in Shaws at that moment........for not taking Connors life myself....so that Wendy would still be here. If I had the chance.......I would have. I would have killed my own sister to save her, and that fact alone fucks with my brain.   \n\n\nThe hard part......There is no help for me. There are no groups, no support for families of murderers. We are usually blamed for situations out of our control, and i dont care.......blame me, i blame myself. But its hard to live, to wake up, to go to work.....the guilt and shame is so much........so so much.....and it never goes away. It never will.   \n\n\nI'm reminded every day of what he did. Job interviews, A simple google search of my name and 20 articles pop up. I get turned down for work for it, people joke about it, people ask me how Connor is even though they know I have no idea, nor do I care if he is alive or dead anymore.   \n\n\nLate December 2015 i found myself on a mountain....with my service weapon to my head. I couldn't do it. I didn't have the guts. Not because i was afraid........but because i didn't want someone to have to find me.......I couldn't  put a police officer through that. Finding the corpse of someone they know to be a strong man, a good man. And having to inform those who care about me.......like Meghan had to inform me......Inside I'm still the guy who helps people. The guy who saves those who need it. I couldn't save Wendy.......I feel that every day.   \n\n\nI will feel that until I die.   \n\n\nI am the Brother of a Murderer, and I have no idea how to deal with it. We, the families of killers, who loved someone who did something so heinous that disgusts us to our core.......we live with it. In silence.....and it never stops. It never ever stops.   \n\n\nTo Wendy's family.....I'm sorry. There are no words I could say that would ever come close to removing your pain. It would be silly to try.  I'm Sorry.   \n\n\n&amp;#x200B;", "subreddit": "GriefSupport"}

She was very mean and abusive towards me but I idolized her so much until I was about 16. Im 19 now and realized how truly bad it was about a year and a half ago. I loved her but in the last few months of her life we weren\u2019t even on speaking terms because she was so mean to me I couldn\u2019t take it.\n\nI flew down for the funeral and everyone was so sad. They couldn\u2019t believe it. My step dad, my grandparents, my 7 year old brother. Everyone was treating me like part of the immediate family who lost someone close but I didn\u2019t feel like it. I felt like an intruder. These people were so sad. They had their lives ruined because apparently they somehow still had hope for her. I watched them sob and I wondered why I wasn\u2019t sobbing too. My ex boyfriend came to the funeral with me and at one point I had to bury my face into his shoulder for a hug because I started laughing for some reason after my step dad started loudly sobbing.\n\nI got to go back on a plane to my normal life except my mom is dead now instead of occasionally giving me calls to send to voicemail.

It\u2019s been really hard. He raised my brothers and I as a single father since getting us back when I was nine. We were really close, enmeshed, unfortunately, and spoke to each other daily in my adult years. He became a severe alcoholic in the last five years of his life and it lead to a worsening of his mental health. Prior to drinking he already struggled with a lot of depression and PTSD from his own abusive childhood. He also carried with him a deep anger towards my mom, something they would share for the entirety of my life. Neither of them ever stopped talking about each other, obsessing over all the ways they hurt each other and demanding of my brothers and I that we share in their exhaustive anger. They\u2019re anger and hurt for each other led them to have an extremely volatile divorce that led the separation of my brothers and I from them for about two years in my early childhood. We saw them mostly only in supervised visitations for a long while, eventually my dad moved to Oregon for a while and my mom lost her rights to see us just after getting unsupervised visits. When my dad did the classes required and got us a place, we tried a few times over the years to have a relationship with my mom, but every time we\u2019d get close to healing, she would become aggressive and abusive again. We never had a functional relationship and I cut contact with her around 17. At 20, I tried again with her and it didn\u2019t work out. The hatred she and my dad shared got in the way and neither of them could see beyond it. It\u2019s been 10 years since we last spoke, and the last message I got from her was to tell me to go to hell the week I was graduating college. Still, I always held on to some hope that her and I might one day be able to have some form of a relationship.\n\nWhen my dad died suddenly, my grief reignited that ember of hope. I had this small hope that she\u2019d reach out to us and do some sort of a \u201cmom thing\u201d with comforting words or something. She didn\u2019t. Instead, she became extremely abusive to my only brother that talks to her and insisted that she would come to the funeral to tell everyone what a horrible person he was. No condolences. No acknowledgement that he\u2019d raised us to be at least half way decent people. Just more anger and vitriol. It sort of sealed the deal though. I realize now that there is no mom that I might someday get back. She\u2019s been gone since I was seven and I\u2019ve been grieving her for a lot of years. \n\nThere\u2019s something relieving in knowing that she\u2019s really gone. The fight between them is over now. Their fight has taken up nearly my entire life and I no longer have to be apart of it. My mom is still alive, but she\u2019s been gone for a long time and the anger that tethered my dad to her, and that he used to tether my brothers and I to her, is gone. They\u2019re both gone now.

I was suggested to write a letter to my mother, something private in hopes it would make the burden easier. I discovered that truthfully, I could write a novel to my mother because she meant that much to me and it's awful things had to happen this way. \n\nIt's such a conflicting feeling after the anger beings to subside. Really, you begin to understand how someone could feel so alone and it frightens you, because just like her, you can't open your heart up. I can't vocally express how alone I feel, even when I have support around me. A piece of my heart is broken beyond repair but I think I'm starting to forgive her and I think for once in my life I don't want to die, that maybe I can make it, do something good with my life, make her proud I loved enough to fill that hole inside me.\n\nI got a new job, with an amazing staff, all of which have all had their share of things happen, but it's good to be around people that get it, that you can be honest with. Maybe it's because they only see you at work? I can't say I tell people often about how I'm doing, after all, I've just been crying a lot. It's kinda lame, but regardless, I know if something really hard happens, I have people that will lift me up. Maybe this is what trust feels like? Maybe this is what your heart feels like when you start to come out of the fog?\n\nI have an amazing support system of friends as well, which really helps. Some of which understands what it's like being without a parent, and even though I feel alone because of how my mother died, I know their heart aches just as much as mine. How she died doesn't matter, **that she also did**, does.\n\nI think this year is going to be good for me, no matter what happens I will grow from it. If I can lose my mother, I can handle anything else thrown in my way. I want to get out a lot this summer, learn to love the world around me a little bit more. Appreciate my friends and family a little more, because you never know when you will see them last. I want to know I was a good person through and through when my time comes and I have to say I never thought I would feel passion for living like this. I want to believe I will learn to open up again, to find myself and really rid myself of this dark cloud.\n\nLosing my mother was one of the worst things to ever happen to me but I'm still going, even when I thought it would destroy me, I kept fighting and I'm learning to even love myself a little more because of it.

I lost my beautiful daughter just over 2 months ago and wanted to share my experience of the grief process so far in the hope that it is insightful for others.\n\nIn the days and weeks that followed the pain of grief was both emotional AND physical. It felt like I had a concrete block pushing down on my chest at all times. I was physically weak and my walking and movements had slowed dramatically. The first few days I threw up soon after I woke up in the morning. I could barely eat a thing and used protein drinks to carry me through. Getting to sleep was hard so I abused alcohol as a solution, however it wasn\u2019t long before that began causing problems of its own so I stopped drinking completely.\n\nYou may find that good friends will drop off the radar so to speak after the funeral. This can be upsetting, however death is such a hard thing to confront and people just don\u2019t know what to say or do. Try not to judge them too harshly. I know if roles were reversed I would be useless support, and I have failed to support friends in the past. You may also find you get messages of support from unexpected people that you would never have considered  via Facebook etc.\n\nPeople often say \u201cI don\u2019t know what to say\u201d - I have found that the best response to that is \u201cI don\u2019t know what to say either\u201d, it makes people realise that we are no experts, this just happened to us. I have also been telling people not to worry about saying the wrong things or treating me like I am special.  There are no wrong things to say really. Personally I think it helps make people feel at ease and they tend to relax more after that.\n\nI am now able to go out and about to the shops etc. I still dread bumping into someone I know as I really can\u2019t cope with the look of pitty they give without even realising they are doing it. I have found it\u2019s actually nice to speak to people I don\u2019t know, shop keepers etc. To them you are a blank unknown canvas and I have found that I am able to be my old self again if only for a little while. It\u2019s a nice break from the \u2018new normal\u2019 you didn\u2019t want or ask for. That\u2019s not to say a wave of emotion won\u2019t hit you unexpectedly, it\u2019s happened a good few times, in my case for example I saw a group of girls my daughters age walking along talking and laughing and it felt like a punch to the stomach knowing that she can no longer do the same.\n\nHowever, Just over 2 months on from that terrible day when my life descended into a nightmare, I know now that I CAN survive. It\u2019s not the future I wanted but I have always been a lover of life and so I want to live it, not just exist.\n\nAs Rob Delaney (actor) said in an interview about losing his son \u201cin the rainbow of emotions I still feel all the colours, green, yellow etc, but now there is also a band of black that wasn\u2019t there before, I try not to hate it\u201d.  I think that is a good description and I let my grief run through me as it needs to, if I cry I cry, if I scream I scream.\n\nGood luck to you all and I hope this has been of some value to people who are still at the very beginning of this unwanted journey.

If you asked her, she would demur, and probably say she did the best she could to get by. \n\nMy earliest memory of my mom was one of total safety and security, and a song - Scarborough Fair. It would be years before I knew that she used to sing it while nursing me as a baby. I still have that rocking chair, and used it for my own baby when it was time. \n\nBefore I was old enough to go to school, my mom worked nights at the ER at Victoria General Hospital. I will never know how she managed to take care of three young daughters and work nights, with a nap (\"Please play quietly in the living room while Mom has a sleep on the couch\") in the afternoon. Days and weekend mornings at my house were filled with music, everything from classical, to ABBA to the Hollies, to Simon and Garfunkle. The song \"Long Cool Woman in a Black Dress\" immediately reminds me of dancing with her, giggling as she spun me around to the beat of the music. \n\nI was her last baby, and the last to start school My first day at kindergarten, she walked me proudly to the bus, and saw me off with hugs, kisses and waves, and sat sobbing on the curb once the bus was out of sight. \n\nMy mom always loved a hot soak in a bathtub, using Calgon bath salts. My sisters and I would race to claim the full bathtub when she was done - all of us coveted the dark blue and \"extra deep\" tub. \n\nOur birthday parties, years before \"birthdays out\" were the standard were the stuff of legends, with apples on strings to bite with no hands, and other homemade games. \n\nI admit, I was mortified when she woke my friends up in the morning after my slumber party to first Dean Martin and then Zamfir's magical pan flute. \n\nFor the three daughters, she constructed elaborate Halloween costumes - twice I was Scarlett O'Hara, even though no one would see the hoop skirts under the snowsuit. \n\nOur neighbourhood used to have a bike parade where all of the children could decorate their bikes - we easily had the best and most elaborate costumes. \n\nShe went into some crafts with gusto - she knitted me the most amazing scarf. It used three or four balls of yarn and I could literally wrap myself in it several times over. She could not remember how to end it, so she kept going. I wore it to a job interview once, and the interviewer commented \"What an impressive scarf!\"\n\nOne winter, my parents worked hard to make the girls an amazing snow slide. My Mom passed buckets of hot water to help make the slide extra slippery. \n\nShe used to paint the windows with these amazing dioramas from Snoopy. Snoopy and Woodstock riding a flying candy cane. \n\nChristmas was made of magic. She carefully counted, making sure that each girl had the same number to unwrap. My Mom was up at the crack of dawn, already making the huge dinner for the dozens expected for supper.  \n\nShe gave to me so many gifts that I am only now starting to understand. My love of reading came from watching her, curled up on the couch, feet under her, a thick book on her lap. This taught me that Moms read - and they read huge tomes with relish. Although money with three kids was tight, my Mom always made sure an Archie comic made it into the shopping cart which was appreciated. Since I learned to speed read, I was often nearly done by the time we got home. \n\nI am sorry that I did not finish writing the several half-novels she enjoyed. \n\nI promise, Mom. \n\nI promise and it is already dedicated to you. \n\nShe taught me that women can be anything and everything they want to be. I am pretty sure I was the only five year old that played Helen Reddy's I am Woman on my Fisher Price Tape Player.\n\nIt was so important that she support our dreams, because she her dream of becoming a nurse was never realized. \n\nShe showed me how to be a mom. \n\nWhenever we were sick, she was tireless in making sure we were cooly bathed when our fevers spiked, and a faint call from the bathroom in the middle of the night would bring her running to hold back hair, and rub your back when you needed it most.  \n\nWhen she was working at the mall, she would bring me home a book and a bag of sour red liquorice. No matter what, she never compromised that which was really important, regardless of budget. \n\nMy Mom would go without so that I had a book to read. \n\nAs the three of us grew into teenagers, Patti struggled a bit with finding a place, which drew a lot of focus. Still, my Mom and I remained close. When I was in theatre, my Mom and Dad came to every performance, and if you asked, she would STILL tell you about a character I played in my high school play. \n\nI joined the Reserves at 17, and it took a few weeks before I hit my stride. The homesickness was overwhelming. To help, my Mom mailed me letters, cards of care packages every day. Once it started, the avalanche of mail from home was pretty impressive. Once, I had asked for some new underwear, but worried, since every package from home brought a lot of attention. She buried my panties and box of tampons under cards, letters and boxes of candy. No one would ever suspect what was under the false bottom. \n\nWhen I was 18, my parents separated, I was angry with her, and blamed her for the splitting up of my family. I was blind to how unhappy she had been, and everything she had sacrificed to try and rediscover her happiness. My only clue had been to come home and find her sobbing - over a copy of The Bridges of Madison County. My parents had married very young, she had barely been 18. Over the years, the distance between them yawned into a canyon. \n\nShe left. \n\nI had no idea that until she saved up, she moved into a studio apartment, with an air mattress and ate hot dogs. It was the first time she had her own space and slowly, she gave herself permission to fill it. \n\nFor weeks, I barely spoke to her.  \n\nBut when I was in a terrible car accident at 19, she was the first person I called. I remember walking to her, my hands and clothes bloody, the memory of my friend dying in my arms fresh, I fell into her arms and cried. \n\nShe stayed with me every step, going to the funeral and to then to court with me so I could testify. She fussed and tried to make sense of how I was struggling with the aftermath. It was through that pain that I reached out for my Mom. And she was there, like always, reaching back and waiting. \n\nWhen I had Darby, my Mom was there, and among the first to hold my baby girl. Darby and her had a special bond, that lasted for the rest of her life. When Darby was home sick from school, or when I was away on military training, Mom and Bubba (Brian) filled the gap, making sure Darby got tons of loves and cuddles until I was home. \n\nWhen Darby's Dad and I were in a car accident coming back from the US, I had to call my sister Patti from the side of the road, while waiting on the ambulance, since she had been babysitting Darby. Brent went to Winnipeg to be with his Mom. \nLater, laying on the cold X-ray table in the hospital in St Pierre Jolys, I remember being in pain, and feeling so alone. \n\nThen I thought I must be hallucinating - was that my MOM'S voice? The double doors slammed open and she appeared with my sister Patti in tow. \nShe had called every RCMP station until she learned where I was and came right away. \n\nMy Mom and I had a deep and loving friendship in recent years, I called every day and she would start with \"Buenos Dias\" - we agreed that was the best way to say hello. \n\nShe was also super easy to embarrass and tease, which I often delighted in. Once, she commented that she wished she had a traffic cone for when she mopped to protect the wet floors.  When were all on on a road trip, and on the way home, I saw a bunch of the big highway cones in the ditch. \n\nHer laughing giggles as Patti and her absconded with one of them are such a warm memory today. \nWhen we pulled up in front of her building, there were police cars parked out front.\n\n\"The jig is up,\" I yelled \"They'll never take us alive!\" \n\nWe laughed so hard. And so often.\n\nI remember once, when my Dad was out of town, deliriously laughing for hours over the dumbest serial killer pun. We could barely get the punchline out! \n\nNo one was prouder of my career in the military than my Mom. She came to every parade and promotion. When I started working on Operation HONOUR and addressing sexual assault and harassment, she would say \"I was never brave enough to stand up, but my daughter is!\" As a survivor herself, her survival alone was a testament to her incredible strength. \n\nShe came to Ottawa when I first moved, helping me turn my new space into a warm home, and then again when I went for the first training camp for Invictus. \n\nMy Mom was lost after Brian passed away last June.  Although she started to try and find activities to fill her days, we all worried about the depth of her grief. When she got sick, it was not a stretch to know that it was the heartbreak of being apart from him that would take her.\n\nIn just the past weeks, as we finally learned the extent of her illness, I was scheduled to leave for Sydney Australia, to compete in the Invictus Games. My Mom was very proud of how hard I had fought back from the devastating pain of PTSD, and I asked her if I should go, knowing that there was a risk she would not make it to the end of the Games. She told me she would hold on as long as she could, but it was very important to her that I go. Every day, I sent home photos and news of the adventure. Patti told me how much she enjoyed them. I tried hard to focus on the Games, and called as often as I could. The morning of cycling, she went on and on how proud she was, how amazing i was, and how strong I was - I told her if I was, it was because she showed me how. \n\nHer enjoyment of my tales from Down Under gives me so much comfort now. Darby and I worked hard to build wonderful memories in the world when my Mom was still alive. We knew once she was gone, things would not be the same. \n\nAs I got ready to face my hardest challenge - swimming - I called home. The day before she had watched a TV interview I had done and told me again how proud she was of me. After having a panic attack in my first race, I just needed to hear my Mom's voice. Patti told me that she was sleeping, but that things seemed to be getting worse. \n\nAs I finished up my last race, I got word that things were deteriorating faster than anticipated. I needed to come home. Interestingly, I swam slower in those races than I had in weeks - missing the cutoff for the finals. The finals would have been the next day. \n\nThe next morning, we flew from Sydney, having to stop in Ottawa since we had no warm clothing or anything other than sports gear and shorts. \nWe unpacked and immediately repacked, for our flight out the next day. I called and talked to her. I told her how much I loved her, and that although I would miss her everyday, I knew she would be with Brian again. She said she was holding on for me. We knew we were racing death, and hoped we would have time. \n\nAs I got ready to leave for the airport, I got word that she was gone. My heart breaks knowing that I will never get to hug her again. \n\nShe was an unbelievable generous and wonderful Mom and Grandma. She tirelessly prepared me for being a Mom and a woman. \n\nShe taught me the most important lessons:\n\nWhen you have a chance at happiness, reach out, grab it and hold on with both hands. \n\nShe taught me to believe in fairies, and fairy tales, and a sense of whimsy is vital, especially in the coldness of today's reality \n\nShe taught me that learning and intelligence comes in many forms, and that you don't need a certificate of diploma to be smart - but education is a key to realize your dreams. \n\nShe taught me my worth, and not to accept any less from the people I choose to have in my life. \n\nShe taught me that if it won't matter in five years, does it really matter now? \n\nShe taught me that true strength isn't hardness. It's allowing your heart to be sensitive, and remaining positive and optimistic, especially when things are toughest. \n\nShe taught me my gifts, and was relentless in her support of my dreams. \n\nThe only thing she did not prepare me for was how to say goodbye to her. \n\nI write this still trying to grasp that I will never hear her voice again. I will miss her everyday. \n\nI love you, Momma.", "subreddit": "GriefSupport"}

I\u2019m still in shock and completely heartbroken.", "author": "HotlantaSummers", "self_text": "The story of my husband starts back in 2016. He was diagnosed with Pancreatic Cancer after his bile ducts were blocked due to the mass growing around them. It was Memorial Day weekend and I noticed he was jaundiced. We were surprised but he had been sick that week and we chalked it up to food poisoning from a diner we had visited. Skip to about a week and a half later when we got the results from the ER, they said it was hepatitis, which didn\u2019t sound right to either of us. So back to his primary doctor we went and she referred us to a GI specialist. He ran his tests and determined it was pancreatic cancer. Our whole world flipped upside down. \n\nHe was sent to get a stent placed, which resulted in complications and infection. The plan was to drain the bile, then schedule major surgery, The Whipple Procedure. I don\u2019t know why they call it a procedure when it MAJOR surgery. They remove and rearrange some organs and intestines. Anyway, after a round of antibiotics, he gets the surgery done and it\u2019s all downhill from there. Complications, infections, C Diff, and pain that doesn\u2019t subside. \n\nPrevious to all this, my husband was hurt in a very bad car vs motorcycle accident. He had severe head trauma and lost his leg. He had grown up hard of hearing but all the head trauma and scarring left him completely deaf. So he learned to get around on crutches and read lips. Back to the Whipple procedure...he needed to then go into a rehab facility to get stronger as he had to use his core to get around the crutches and that was extremely painful. \n\nA few months passed, and he was ready to start chemo. In the meantime, he had gone back to work. He owned his own shop at the time and was needed. He didn\u2019t waste any time in getting back. He did his chemo and 6 months later was cleared. He rang the bell and was free to go. What a joyous time. We wanted to celebrate and scream it from the rooftops. \n\nA month later, we moved down to Georgia, his home state. We wanted to be closer to family and because I just fell in love with GA. \u2014 Like clockwork, every month that passed we ended up in the hospital. Chief complaint: Pain. This went on from June 2017 until February 2018. The discharge papers stated he was seeking pain medication. Not once did someone take into consideration that he had battled cancer before. Ultrasounds were performed and no one saw anything on them, until we scheduled an appointment with a surgical oncologist who found the tumor. We were devastated. \n\nSeveral round of chemo were done. He got a feeding tube placed. Then a picc line for pain management. Endless visits to the ER and hospital stays. He was physically and mentally tired. He wanted to quit so many times and I would encourage him to keep going just a little longer. I told him I wasn\u2019t ready to let him go. \n\nThe final time he went into the hospital was the night of his birthday, 2.4.19. He broke out in a sweat, but said he was freezing, he was hyperventilating and just repeating over and over \u201cI just want it to stop!\u201d  I called the ambulance and they took him to Emory University Hospital. He was kept there for 4 days. She had a bloodstream infection. Another 14 days of antibiotics. We were able to. \u201ccelebrate\u201d our anniversary on the 11th and then Valentine\u2019s day. All throughout he was still breathing hard and shallow but insisted he was fine. He slept a whole lot the week before he passed. From the 14th until the 21st, he slept the majority of the time. I never like to bother him and wanted him to rest so I would stay away either in my room or the kitchen. \n\nThat final night was a strange one. I had been working from home and he had slept until about 4pm. I get a text from his friend, Kevin (who we haven\u2019t seen since November). Kevin has a fight with his mom and wanted us to pick him up so he could spend the night with us. I explained all of that to my husband and he said for me to go alone because he wasn\u2019t feeling well. So I go and get Kevin. They both sat in the living room just chitchatting. I was in and out doing laundry and such. My husband was breathing hard again and I got up to check on him. He again insisted he was fine. I sat back down. A little while later, he shot up outta his recliner and reached for his garbage pail. He started throwing up. Kevin said we should take him to the hospital. My husband was adamant that he would not go back to the hospital. So I gave him a dish towel to wipe his mouth. He was trying to catch his breath and then said \u201cI\u2019m ok, I\u2019m ok. Just help me to the bathroom.\u201d \nI pulled his wheelchair around and he didn\u2019t have the energy and said \u201cGimme a minute.\u201d Those were the last words he said to me. \n\nWhile he was trying to catch his breath, I figured I\u2019d go let the dogs out since it was time and always my routine. When I was in the back room, I heard the crutches being moved and was confused. So I ran back inside, and he was on the ground. He didn\u2019t brace for the fall at all. The way his arm and head were bent and just the way he landed, we knew something was wrong. We attempted CPR with the dispatcher on the line. \n\nParamedics cane and called it as soon as they saw him. \n\nMy husband (44 years old) of 9 years was gone in an instant. I know that I should\u2019ve expected that considering the aggressiveness of Pancreatic Cancer, but I was not ready. We still had so much more to do in life. He was my world. I don\u2019t have any family in GA and no friends. I am absolutely lost and fear what will happen to me and our 5 fur babies. \n\n\n[Photos of my Husband, before and after diagnosis](https://imgur.com/a/zWzA39N)\n\n\nTL;DR : Husband battled Pancreatic Cancer for 2 years.

He didn\u2019t see it as a problem but it really strained our relationship. I keep waking up and suddenly realizing he\u2019s gone and how permanent that feels. Surely he is just a phone call away? But no, I have his phone in a drawer in my kitchen. It was fine when he was alive and I didn\u2019t talk to him for long periods of time, because I knew he was still there. I regret so much. A lot of our relationship was hard and painful due to his alcoholism, mismanagement of money (that he felt I should supplement) and who he deemed as important in his life.

In some ways, I've been dreading this moment for the past decade. Yet there is a part of me that never really believed it would happen.\n\nMy brother was what doctors called \"medically complicated.\" He was diagnosed with mental retardation soon after birth. And though he was always developmentally delayed, he got all the social genes in our family. Very outgoing, always wanted to connect. He struggled with language, but that never stopped him from communicating with people anyway he could. \n\nAt some point along the way, doctors added an autism spectrum diagnosis to the mix. Then he developed a seizure condition that could get pretty scary. \n\nWhen he got older, my aging parents sought placement in a group home for him. He was still as social as ever, but also super strong and could get violent. \n\nSoon after that, my dad died and I became co-guardian. I struggled with this. My brotherr's seizure disoder was getting worse. There was always this looming fear that when my mom passed, I would be solely responsible for him. Also, as social as he was, loving him was complicated. You didn't get a lot back. With every seizure, his ability to communicate, his memories, his connection to the world dwindled.\n\nIn the past few years, he's spent as much time in ERs and hositals as out of them. He moved from the group home to an post acute care facility. Doctors said he was on a seizure spiral that would eventually lead to his death. They kept trying different meds to control the seizures, but that often led to compromised breathing, pneumonia, eventually a trach and a feeding tube. \n\nEvery big seizure resulted in a midnight trip to the ER and preparing for the worst. Then he would bounce back, regain some of his abilities and go back to baseline...asking everyone \"what name?\" and trying to connect with his shrinking supply of words.\n\nThere were so many times I prepared for \"this is it.\" I thought he would keep bouncing back. And this time, there was no trip to the ER. Just a midnight call from his facility saying it was over.\n\nI wasn't ready for it to be true. And it's not just grief I'm feeling, but guilt. For being the \"normal\" sibling. For dreading being responsible for him. For not wanting to sit by his side with every hospitalization like my mother did. \n\nNot a lot of people I can share this with.

He was in and out of jail a few times (minor offensives) but we just never talked about those things. We talked every day about Pok\u00e9mon, Anime, video games literally anything except the hard things in his life. I tried very hard to get my brother to move in with my grandparents. But my grandparents wouldn\u2019t let him move in unless he went to rehab which my brother didn\u2019t want to do. \n\nSometime in April 2017 we stopped talking every day but I didn\u2019t really think about it. In May 2017 My grandma called me out of school early and told me i needed to call in to work. My brother had collapsed and was in the hospital. My brother had apparently tried to stop doing heroin cold turkey. He had gotten really sick and thought that it was withdrawals. The last time he had used it, it was with a dirty needle and he had developed a staph infection. Staph infections are pretty common but without treatment can be deadly. It had spread out through his blood into his brain and heart. \n\nFor two weeks my brother couldn\u2019t move and couldn\u2019t talk. I stayed everyday all day. I was in his room as much as possible and would play anime, music, and just talk as much as possible. Neither my brother and I are religious even despite growing up catholic, but i ended up praying anyways. At first doctors said he wouldn\u2019t make it but as days went on and he improved little bit by bit they thought he would make it. I was still in high school and the hospital he was staying in was two hours away so i was obviously missing school. Since he would \u201cget better with time\u201d my family asked me to leave and go back to school. I left and the very next night my brother died in the hospital from two heart attacks. \n\nI feel so regretful and that if i had stayed maybe things would\u2019ve been different? I know it\u2019s stupid but i just feel so weak and that if i had tried harder for him he would still be here. i know people don\u2019t have sympathy for drug addicts but he was such a good person. As i said before he was the reason i\u2019m into video games and obviously internet shit. Now i have so many figures and plushies that every time i look at them i just cry because it\u2019s not the same without him. I dropped out of high school and got my ged because I had missed so much from grieving.\n\n I\u2019m in my first year of college now but still completely depressed, heartbroken, and unmotivated. I\u2019m on academic probation for failing last semester, i need to do well this semester but even now i still can\u2019t bring myself to study or do anything because i miss him so much.

They just let him every single time, they never once said \"if you call in, you're gonna get fired\". So I just did my best to be supportive. He thought I was gonna be mad at him and told me he appreciated me being supportive and loving. I asked him there was anything I could do for him, I was like \"do you want me to bring you some food?\" He asked me to bring him Arbys. I was at work so I told him to just let me know when he gets home and I'll go on break and bring him some Arbys. I was gonna get him some flowers because it was Valentine's day, and our 2 year anniversary was on the fifth and he had gotten me flowers. But he never made it home.

He had a minute at most left and he would've been there and everything would've been fine.\n\nHis mom called me at work and told me he was in an accident, and that they weren't sure of the extent of the injuries. I lost my shit. I clocked out and booked it to my car, I must've blew 20 over the speed limit getting there, honking at people and spinning my tires, crying and panicking, fearing the worst. We weren't even there ten minutes before they told us he was gone. He probably died right there in the next room away from us while we were sitting there. \n\nAfter we spoke to the investigator, I spent some time alone with him. I couldn't believe my eyes. He was pale, there was blood in his nose and his eyes were half open. There was a tube in his mouth and his tongue was hanging halfway out. I fell to my knees and completely fell apart. He's really gone. He's seriously, really, truly gone. He's never gonna go home, I'll never get to go home to him ever again. I kissed him all over, wiped away some of his eye boogers and some paint chips from his car that were on his face. I shut his eyes for him and held his hand and completely lost my mind. Crying and screaming, clenching my teeth and having a complete mental breakdown. I kissed him on his forehead one last time. He was so cold. So fucking cold. I went to our place to gather my stuff and some of his things, frantically pacing and freaking out. I made some phone calls and played a few songs for him. \n\nEvery fiber of my being is in pain. I can't think straight and my body feels weak and sick. I miss him so much. I would die a thousand painful deaths just to bring him back, just to have five more minutes alive with him. I haven't been to work since and I don't know how I'm going to. My life is completely turned upside down. \n\nHis wake was on Monday and funeral was on Tuesday, 25th and 26th of February. I played a couple songs on my guitar for him. I played one that he wrote about me and I played Wish You Were Here by Pink Floyd, it was one of our songs. I showed him Pink Floyd when we first got together. \n\nI watched him go from looking feminine and like a beautiful woman to looking like a hairy, masculine man. It was like watching a child grow before my eyes. His voice was just starting to change and he got hairy all over and his facial structure was starting to change. He looked so beautiful.\n\nOne of the worst parts of this is that in the police reports and news reports, they all called him by his dead name and called him she. When his family called to have it changed, they all changed it to \"driver\", \"resident\". Why the FUCKING FUCK IS IT SO HARD TO JUST PUT HE. YOU LITERALLY JUST HAVE TO ERASE ONE FUCKING LETTER THAT'S FUCKING IT. I'M SO FUCKING SICK OF LIVING ON THIS TRANSPHOBIC, IGNORANT FUCKING PLANET. \n\nI'm sorry, I'm falling apart and I can't think straight anymore. Please, please, please say a prayer for him. I don't know if I believe in God or the afterlife but if there's a heaven, he's definitely there. I hope he got the body he always wanted. He always said he wished he had my body, he compared me to the Statue of David. I hope he's a hairy, bearded man up there, wherever he is. \n\nPlease, please tell your loved ones how much you cherish them and make sure they know they are loved. Kiss your significant others, hug your parents, tell your friends and family how much they mean to you.

She was so still, so cold. This afternoon I held her hand and it was warm, and though her breathing was labored, there were still gentle, rhythmic movements in her chest. I guess life is just that fragile. She had a long month and now I'm glad that she can at least rest easy and not be in pain anymore.\n\nPerhaps no one cares/knew her, but if it means anything I'd like to share some memories of her. She lived with my family and raised me ever since I was born. I remember being little and going to the park and supermarket with her, and how I used to cry in the morning when I woke up and didn't see her in the room, then she'd come back from the kitchen or bathroom to reassure me that she was still there. Primary and high school came around and she made me and my brother breakfast everyday before school, and made the whole family dinner every night. God I miss her cooking, though she had already retired from that for a few years. I went to school overseas for many years and only got to see her and my family a few times a year until I came home 2 years ago. Every time before I flew back for school, she'd give me a red pocket as a safekeeping. I still have those scattered in my bags, I think I will keep them there for as long as I can. She was always caring, up until the end. Even when she couldn't really walk, sometimes she'd still go to the supermarket with her wheelchair to buy fruit and various things for us. My parents cared a lot for her too, she had a comfortable life and was well looked after.\n\nI hope I was a good enough granddaughter for her, because she was none but the best for me. I miss her a lot. Even though I'm not religious, I hope she's somewhere peaceful and free of pain with my grandpa. They'd be watching over us. Perhaps one day I'd see her again.", "subreddit": "GriefSupport"}

She's been fighting it for just a bit over a year now... At one point treating it looked really hopeful, because she has an identical twin which opened up a whole bunch of treatment options that most people don't have (they actually got written up in a medical journal)... But she never really recovered from the last surgery, and now they think it cancer is back and a lot more aggressive then they first thought... So instead of the 10-15years that they'd given her it's looking like a lot less... But I won't get the results of the last batch of tests until mid month... So I'm not sure how much less time she actually has... I'm just hoping for good news...\n\nTo compound issues... I live very far away (my spouse is in the military), and can't be there very often... And I'm dealing with other family issues whan I can be there do to a complicated blended family situation with my step kids (my step kids and their mom live 2 hours away from my parents place)... That's a long story in itself... But as an example I spent 2 weeks cleaning my partners ex wife's apartment because she is legitimately a horder and the court had given her primary care of my step kids before my partner remarried, as long as her parents checked-in on her and made sure she wasn't falling back into old patterns (they haven't been holding up that agreement), the only reason my partner didn't get primary care is he can be deployed at anytime and who would look after the kids when he's gone... All this was decided right when he and I had first started dating, so I really wasn't factored in.... So the whole situation with her has already been something that we've been trying to sort out, and sometimes it feels like she's this teenage daughter I didn't really sign up for, but I'm trying to be civil and help her out for the sake of my step kids... And right now especially I just need her to act more like an actual adult, because the last trip to see everyone was monopolized by her shit and I didn't get to see my friends or family that much... If it wasn't for the kids I wouldn't bother with her, but they deserve better... At the same time I really want to be there for my Mom, so it's really leading to resentment of this woman who can't seem to just get her shit together...\n\nI'm also angry... So angry and frustrated it makes me want to cry... Growing up my mom was really bad for brushing of anything I said as being mellow dramatic or an exaggeration... It was always very dismissive, and kinda gaslighting...\nShe is also a workaholic and gas always put her job and work before family which has been a soar point for me for a long time, because I was left to look after my siblings and I for long periods of time from the time I was 8, and she kinda checked out of a lot of family life in favour of work and school... It was made painfully clear to me that she worked and went to school purely for fun and not really for the money, because my dad actually made a lot, and even though she denies saying these things now... She used to tell me that she basically just didn't like me so she spent so much time away so she didn't have to be around me... So needless to say I didn't exactly feel loved by her when I was little... And even though our relationship has gotten better... There's a lot of stuff left unsaid and undone... The fact that she didn't go to the doctor when I first told her that she should get checked out to make sure it wasn't something serious (I honestly thought it was probably a pulled muscle, but it wasn't going away so I was worried) and she brushed it off like I was \"over reacting\" and didn't actually get checked out until over a year later, is just frustrating... We live in Canada it could've been caught a whole year earlier, and treatment could've been more effective... Like couldn't she just take me seriously for once, because this time it might actually be the death of her...\n\nSo I'm sad, depressed, frustrated and angry... \nNot to mention just burnt out (did I mention I also have a toddler)... And it my normal everyday I feel like I can't express any of this, because it's my mom that has the cancer and is the one actually dying... It feels like I'm not allowed to feel angry at her for the stuff unfinished between us... But I am... So I guess that's why I'm posting here.", "subreddit": "GriefSupport"}

He had just celebrated his 90th birthday two weeks before. \n\nThis being the case many people, including some friends, seem to think that I\u2019m taking this too hard, but many of them don\u2019t understand why this has been the most earth shattering week of my life. \n\nMy granddad was functionally my father. When my much too young junkie parents lost custody of my older brother and I, he and my grandmother fought for custody of us. He was recently retired and mama was still working, and as such he became a stay at home dad to two traumatized toddlers overnight. \n\nHe\u2019s the first man I ever fully trusted. The first man I knew I could count on. The kisser of owies. My first and best teacher for everything from calculating gas mileage (4 years old) to reading (also 4) and how to throw a punch (which he thought was an under-utilized life skill for young women). \n\nFive years ago he called to tell me his doctor had found a mass in his bladder. They wanted to do exploratory surgery to see if it was cancerous. Due to his age they wouldn\u2019t normally advise surgery, but he was in excellent health. He walked over 5 miles a day unassisted, and rarely got up later than 430 am because he liked to garden before it got \u201ctoo late\u201d but he always made mama breakfast before he went outside.   \n\nI knew something was wrong when I called him the day after his surgery to check on him. He was having memory issues that he\u2019d never had before. He couldn\u2019t remember which of his daughters was my mother when I told him that mommy\u2019s birthday was the next day. The doctors said it would pass. Instead it grew worse. The anesthesia had triggered a stroke that affected the impulse control portions of his brain. Within a month he was throwing violent tantrums and wandering outside without his clothes on. He was still incredibly strong physically and even my brother had trouble restraining him when he was having a fit. \n\nMy grandmother (mama) died 3 years ago. We think her body finally gave out from exhaustion and despair. She cried on the phone to me almost daily. They fought a lot, but loved each other fiercely. It killed her to see him that way. We thought granddad wouldn\u2019t long outlive her but we were wrong. His body still wouldn\u2019t let him go. \n\nHe hasn\u2019t been able to walk for more than a year. It got harder to understand him as he started reverting back to his native languages, sometimes in the same sentence (Hawaiian mostly, but also Japanese and Tagalog). I graduated college in December and started going back home once a month to help with his care. In the last 5 years he\u2019s had many close calls but always rallied. When I arrived last week he had a cold. He said he was dying in Hawaiian, but he\u2019d said it before. I wasn\u2019t worried. On day 2 of my visit he stopped eating. On day 3 his breathing was rapid and he was wheezing. SPO2 was only 77% and he was tachy. At that point I knew he was dying imminently. I was supposed to go home on the 4th day but I knew it wouldn\u2019t be long. I didn\u2019t want to be driving home when he passed. He died when I stepped out for 15 minutes to run an errand. \n\nSince that night I haven\u2019t been myself. I\u2019m the one my family leans on when they need to vent, or cry, or they just need support. I\u2019ve been bearing the burden of all of their grief and my own and somehow I\u2019ve completely lost my chill. I\u2019ve gotten in two screaming matches with strangers in the last week (I hate confrontation, so I\u2019ve never done that before). I\u2019m spontaneously weeping, at work, at home, everywhere. I snapped at my fianc\u00e9e because a girl on Instagram who lives over 1000 miles away went through and liked all of his posts. \n\nI used my PTO allotment when I had the flu earlier this year and  I have to pick up extra shifts to be able to afford to go home for the funeral, so I\u2019ve flung myself into work to keep myself occupied. Instead of helping, I\u2019ve been breaking down at work. I work with seniors with health issues, so every day reminds me of my loss. \n\nI\u2019m a mess and I don\u2019t recognize myself. \n\nI\u2019m ashamed because I feel like I\u2019m letting him down by not pulling myself together. \n\nI know that this is irrational.

It does slowly get better, for any kind of grief, but don't get down on yourself if you break. It's okay, do not let anyone else tell you otherwise.\n\nFour years ago February I laid in the high risk doctor's office because she was the only doctor who had a sonogram machine actually in her office. The doc I was seeing was just a regular doc and did not have these machines for normal pregnancies. I was told that my first son didn't have a heartbeat anymore. I started crying and then apologized for crying to which I was told that it was okay. I had to make the agonizing call to my husband who was out of state for business purposes and tell him the news. He was in a whole different time zone and working nights so I ended up waking him up. He didn't understand what I was saying and asked for clarification. \"Isaac is gone. What else do you want me to say?\" It was a whirlwind. I had a close friend who I texted but she'd just had some sort of teeth surgery, I can't remember what, and I sat in an office by myself for what felt like an eternity making phone calls to people about the next steps and getting phone calls from family letting me know they'd be driving to me ASAP. I believe it was the 12th. I had to call the larger hospital to make arrangements to give birth to my son. They wanted me to come in the 13th and I, probably not the best decision, refused. I didn't want my son to be born on Valentine's day and fuck that day for the rest of my life. (Plot twist it is anyway) So we were going to go in that Sunday the 15th. We we're supposed to call the hospital at 5am to make sure they had space and whatever. So after a long restless night on the 14th we wake up super early on the 15th and call and they say to come in. On the way there I get a phone call from a nurse or someone asking if we could actually come in later. I said, trying not to breakdown, that we were already on the way. The hospital with no traffic was thirty minutes across town. We arrive there and I'm put in a large room and I can have whoever I want in there. Sorry useless details... Isaac was born early morning on the 16th at 32 weeks gestation. Seeing him has sadly traumatized me. But I remember his sweet little face. I saw that same little face again when Isaac's little brother was born almost three years ago. (To give clarification I went through counseling and the like before getting pregnant again and I felt like I was as emotionally stable as a woman could be after losing an infant while they were in utero.) I have my sweet rainbow but I break down like three times a year and I start functioning at basically 25-50% in life during those times.

And I remember feeling safe. I have so many memories of him. \n\nThe one that sticks out the most is the last day. I was in middle school. It was May 31st. And I woke up before my alarm, which never happened and I was confused. And I remember hearing a sharp crack. And walking over to my window and looking down on the street. There was a truck on the road. And I was confused because I knew that truck. But it wasn't right. It didn't belong here. It belonged in (other state halfway across the country). \n\nI saw him pacing around, and that's when my mom came running into my room, on the phone. \n\n\"There's a man outside our house with a gun,\" she was saying.\n\n\"Mom, I think it's dad.\" \n\nThings are in pieces after that. I remember my mom pushing me back from the window. I remember her guiding us downstairs. I remember my dog barking in the garage. I remember my mom saying we couldn't take her with us. My sister was really quiet. A police officer met us at the back door. We ran through the back yards. My mom got upset because I couldn't keep running, my asthma was acting up. Part of me wanted to go back. I didn't understand why we were running. Dad wouldn't hurt us. \n\nWe got to the end of the road. And I got to sit in the front passenger seat.  We made it to the station and a couple officers sat with me and my sister making paper airplanes. We threw them at other people as they walked past the door to the conference room we were in. Time passed, and my mom walked in with her boyfriend at the time. And I already knew. I think my sister did too. It was a weird feeling, like I had known since I woke up and saw him on the street. He didn't belong here. \n\nWe couldn't go back to the house, because the media was there, so the police took us to her boyfriend's house. The glass was shot out of all the windows. The back sliding door was completely smashed in. The basement was covered in water because the waterbed had been shot. Her boyfriend had been his best friend. He had gone there first. My sister, she was only eight (I was twelve), but I wanted to hit her. The TV had been shot too- she wanted to know if she could use whatever money dad left her to buy a new TV. A new TV. What about Dad?\n\nWe grabbed a couple things we each had there. By then family had shown up and got us to a hotel. We got my dog- thank goodness. But I knew Dad would never hurt her. He loved her too. \n\nFour or five days later we were back home. There was a dent in the front door and the garage door. The garage door was when he was randomly shooting. I later found out that the front door was left from when he shot himself. I didn't find out until long after we moved and the new people had put up a new door. It hurts realizing how many times I never put two and two together. \n\nMy dad's sister came. She was there to accompany the body back and deal with his belongings in our state. She's my favorite aunt now, but back then they lived so far away and we rarely saw them before the divorce. My mom refused to let us be alone with her. I could tell it was breaking her heart back then, especially seeing the boyfriend/best friend. She couldn't stay long in his presence. \n\nMy sister and I chose together not to go to the funeral. We didn't understand what was going on, but we both had this worry that we wouldn't come back. I regret not going. It doesn't feel like he's actually gone. It feels like he shouldn't only be a phone call away. \n\nI found out later that my dad had called about a week before. He had just gotten a new job, and it was going to be a bit before he started getting paid, and he wanted to arrange with my mom for the child support to be late. BF/BF answered the phone. He told him if he ever wanted to see me and my sister again he'd find a way to make the payment. That night he said he was going to see his brother in another state, and came to us instead. \n\nI remember all this about my dad. I miss him. I struggle every day knowing that he's gone. Even after seeing his grave it doesn't feel real. I didn't get to see it until I was 21- nine years later. I'm 25 now, and I don't know what to tell my future kids about why I don't like their stepgrandfather, or why their real grandfather isn't here. I don't know what to do for a father-daughter dance at my wedding. I don't know who should walk me down the aisle, or if I should walk alone. I don't know what he would think of my boyfriend, because he did have a bit bigotry in him, but I like to think he would have come around to having a Jewish son-in-law. And now I hear little comments about how he was growing up from my uncles, but when my grandma is around she shuts down conversation- she doesn't let anything negative be said about him, but I feel like I need to hear it. About how my dad always needed lawyers for the trouble he got into growing up. Or how he only joined the military because it was that or jail. \n\nI'm sorry if this was long or too rambly. I'm feeling a little lost right now. Thank you to anyone who read this far. I appreciate you sticking with it. I'm crying- been since I started typing. But I think I feel better too. Thank you.

I can't say that I was particularly close to her, I don't have many fond memories, hell I barely have any memories of her. Her 3 sons that she left behind though, we spent our entire childhood and adolescence growing up together. I can't tell you where she worked, I can't even tell you her name because she was always known as just \uc774\ubaa8. I can't say that we were really close, I can't say that there's anything left unsaid, I can't say that I miss her. But I still feel this immense pain, a lump in my throat, an emptiness I didn't know I could feel. \n\nAt the funeral I looked around the room, thanked everyone who came and saw the broad range of people in her life and her family's life. She was 52. I saw her mother wonder why she had to bury her child. I saw other elders remembering where they were at age 52, living their life and not laying in a casket. I see my cousins who are in too much disbelief to cry. I see them hesitating to pack up their mother's belongings. I see them weigh their options between apartments since they can't afford their current apartment without her. I see them worrying about how to best take care of their grandmother that lives with them. I see them growing up too fast without the support of a father who should've been there for 20 years. Finally I see my aunt laying in the casket. I can't tell if her face is that pale because of the fact that theres no longer any blood in her body or the fact that shes wearing way more makeup than she did in life. She's wearing her usual, casual and comfy cardigans; the detail getting less and less visible as we lay flowers across it. At the end of it all I imagine my mother laying there even though shes standing right next to me. \n\nThe best way I can describe my feelings is that I am empathizing with my dear cousins too much. I can't be there for them right now because I'm still in school and it pains me to imagine the pain they're going through without me. I feel ridiculous. I know that if she could see me now she wouldn't want me to just cry meaninglessly, she'd want me to adjust and continue on with my life. I can't do that knowing how much her absence is affecting my family. \n\nI shouldn't be hurting this much right? I barely knew her, I was just close to her sons.

She basically raised me through my childhood and we were incredibly close. She had alzheimer\u2019s disease so I hadn\u2019t actually seen her for about a year due to the hurt i was feeling from her no longer recognising me. \n\nIn January 2017, my mother(54) died after battling cancer for nearly 4 years. I was in denial of how unwell she was towards the end so her death came as a massive shock to me. It was like she wanted to make sure her mother died before her and then she sort of gave up.\n\nIn May 2017 my dad (50) also died of cancer after a shorter battle of about 9 months / a year. My dad and I were never particularly close throughout my childhood but I had a tremendous respect for him and held him with the highest regard. After the loss of my mother, he and I grew closer in the 4 months before his death than we\u2019d ever been before. It was like the loss of my mother opened him up emotionally and i finally got to see the person behind the \u201cmen don\u2019t have emotions\u201d act. But before i could really appreciate the new found closeness between he and I, his health began rapidly declining after missing 2 chemotherapy sessions due to complications.\n\nThen he died and now i\u2019m all alone. I have no brothers and my only relative remaining is my grandmother (father\u2019s mother) who i\u2019m not particularly fond of and rarely saw throughout my childhood.

He died unexpectedly in his sleep - he was only 31. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHaving this happen is a lot like instantly belonging to a club that no one ever wants membership to, but those who already belong are remarkably warm and helpful. Those outside of it really have no idea what it's like, but those within are instantly ready to help you. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe grief has been intense, and at times unbearable. There always looms over my head this unbearable and awful realization that my brother is truly gone - not just in the abstract, but in reality. \n\n  \nIt also means that there are funerals beyond just the real, actual one. His lives and mine were intensely intertwined - we worked together, we talked daily, we had big plans for the future. I'm an architect / furniture designer, and we were smack dab in the middle of a huge loft renovation for him. We were planning on opening a firm together in the future; we had even half-jokingly talked of building homes adjacent to one another. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI've had to grieve each of those things too, the losses of which I'm still wrestling with. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe pain - it ebbs and flows, and while it still comes at random and without warning, there is some regularity to it. I find it's worse when I returned to work - although I'm surrounded by people, I feel so intensely isolated. This was also the time I used to communicate with my brother most frequently, usually over GChat - and now that is a huge void. The pain during these times is most real and most intense. But in the mornings and at night - I don't know if it's just numbness or fatigue - but it lessens. There are even moments of respite, maybe you could call it peace, in this. \n\n  \nI have also found things that put me at ease more than others. Reading has been an immense source of some comfort, and I've been reading almost a book a night since he died, mostly on grief. Some of these have been helpful; some have been less so. Writing seems to help as well; I've written a thousand or so words each day, throughout the day, to just put down on paper what is happening to me and why and how I am feeling. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI have a strong family; two sisters, my parents, my wife and two children. These have all been an intense source of support for me and I am so thankful that I have a strong family. I'm grieving my brother; but my parents are grieving their son. In a lot of ways, remembering that it is not just I that is grieving, but many others, helps me. Grieving is in so many ways a very selfish thing, necessarily so. You are sad because of all the things YOU miss, and sometimes you forget there are other people suffering as well. I have put a lot of my energy and focus on keeping the rest of my family together; making sure everyone else is making their way through this. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTalking helps too. I don't know why, but when I have talked openly about it with others it somehow makes me feel better. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI've taken immense inspiration from people like Joe Biden - I listened to a podcast where he talked about the recent passing of his son, and how he used his personal integrity and principles as things to uphold and live up to amidst all the sadness and grief. As hard as it is, I try to think of what might make him proud. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt's still fresh and so new - it's been two weeks. I have momentary lapses where I forget for a moment then have to remember all over again - oh yeah - my brother's dead. They are awful moments. But slowly, the reality of his death is solidifying in mind, and as horrific as that it, it's the next necessary step towards healing. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy faith has been a source of solidity in this. C.S. Lewis' short tome \"A Grief Observed\" is a wonderful read, if for no other reason than it allows you to see that others - even great men of intellect and faith - experience grief with just as much sadness, doubt, and difficulty as anyone. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI lost 12 pounds in 8 days, and was sleeping about 2 hours a night. I'm now sick as a result. I find that the nights I sleep better I generally function infinitely better the next day. Right away I relied on Tylenol PM to get even a few hours; I have since downgraded to CBD oil and melatonin - which have been giving me much better sleep. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOne of the joys and sorrows of the internet is that my brother's traces are left all over my online life; my email box is so full of interactions with him; we shared pinterest boards, basecamp accounts, etc. His life is writ all over my internet history. Right now this leaves me sad, but I hope someday I can look back with fondness at some of our stupid and deep conversations. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm sad that I'm sad all the time. But although it's only been two weeks, the days are slowly, on average, getting ever so slightly better. I remain hopeful; that amidst this tragedy I will emerge - not the same, to be sure. But hopefully with a chance to return to the life I found so full of passion and love and joy before, even amidst the void that my brother left. ", "subreddit": "GriefSupport"}

It was the second hardest thing I've ever done in my life. Every minute since has been consumed with trying not to lose my head and start bawling - I'm only about 20% successful. I miss his face. I miss his sounds. I miss his cuddles. He had a brother, who has been doing really well and doesn't even really seem to miss him. Every morning, my lab wakes me up to let him outside. He goes downstairs and says hi to his brother, then goes potty. While he's doing that, old man would get up, and come let me cuddle him for a few minutes. Very specific ritual. I'd crouch down, old man would put his head in between my knees, lean in, and just ask for me to rub his neck and shoulders. And I'd give him some good rubbies, and a minute or so later he'd have enough and be on with his day (shibas, man. They want affection but only on their schedule). Well today, my lab woke me up. He walked by where my old man should be. He went outside to potty. I went upstairs and cried my eyes out because my old man wasn't there. A few minutes later, my lab barked at my bed side, where I should be (was crying in another room so not to wake my husband). I walked in to see what was up. I crouched down.

Maybe it's dumb, maybe it's how my brain needs to process this, but it makes me think there's more to our existence than we know. Anyways.

He was sober almost 3 years and sober John was all I knew. But his addiction started at the young age of 20. John joined the marines right out of high school and deployed to Haditha Iraq 2006 at the age of 19. Injured physically and emotional he was sent home on opioids. At the age of 31 he lost his battle on December 6th. The same day our baby turned 1 month old. I met John sober and only ever knew him as sober John. For the course of our relationship he was in veterans drug court which held him accountable to take random drug test. Ultimately I think the accountability kept him sober. He graduated drug court two days after our daughter was born and overdosed exactly one month later. \n\nThe decision he made that day has affected my life in every single aspect. He overdosed at my small business which was damaging to my employees and business, he left me responsible for our baby, I grieve that she will never meet him or have the father daughter bond that she deserves. He has affected my relationships with family and friends. People I feel should be reaching out to me haven\u2019t and people I never expected would have. \n\nNo one could possibly understand how I feel. I live in a small town and now I feel like I am the girl who\u2019s boyfriend overdosed at her business. I built my business from scratch and worked 6 long hard years on making a name for myself in this small town. Now it feels tarnished. Doesn\u2019t matter if it\u2019s not because it\u2019s how I feel. \n\nSo now it\u2019s just me and my beautiful baby. I have family but to be honest I\u2019ve never been too close to them. I\u2019ve always had dreams of picking up and moving to Colorado. I traveled there a lot over the past 5 years and have friends in the area. John has been gone 3 months and I know you\u2019re not supposed to make any decisions until a year after. But would it be crazy for me to want to sell my business pick up my belongings and move with my daughter alone? I want to find myself and escape from this small town. I hate to take my baby away from her family but moving temporarily for a few year is something I\u2019m seriously considering. For the first time in my life I see things differently and the hustle bustle and keeping up with the Jones\u2019s of this small town isn\u2019t making me happy. \n\nAlso I feel very capable of moving finding a job and acclimating into a new environment. It\u2019s always something I\u2019ve wanted to do. I\u2019ve always been very independent and a go getter opening my business at the age of 23. So I\u2019m confident I could make the journey.

I wrote her a long letter telling her how much I loved her, apologizing for not calling/visiting as much as I should have, saying anything that hurt her, thanking her for all the incredible memories and things she did that made my life wonderful, and telling her I would carry her with me all my life, in whatever I do.

My last time seeing him, I was happily tucking him away into my brother's truck...I was sending him off to visit my (then) wife.  She and I were separated but it was amicable and communication seemed great.

{"post_id": "azienm", "created_utc": 1552241255, "title": "Getting really angry, it's hurting my wife", "author": "Psych40", "self_text": "So I'm in my mid-40s, and my Mom died of stage 4 pancreatic cancer a little less than two years ago, May of 2017. \n\nA little about me. I have three kids (two with my ex-wife, and one stepdaughter with my second wife), I work as a medical professional in my day job. Although my life is a bit complicated, I should really have it all - I'm successful at my job, I'm saving well for retirement, I have three brilliant kids, and a lovely, awesome wife. I'm also six-plus years sober, which is excellent. \n\nMy biggest problem right now is that my wife says I haven't properly mourned the passing of my Mom. Which may be true, I don't know. The one thing that's been happening over the last few months is this - she and I have been fighting more. And it's not like, normal fighting. What happens is she gets frustrated about something, and she expresses her feelings are hurt by something I did or didn't do - and she is feeling frustrated, angry, sad. I apologize, but I'm also defensive. She gets annoyed and more frustrated, and expresses it more. Then - I get infuriated. I get downright **angry**. I yell a bit and tell her she's 100% in the wrong, and I demand an apology, and I feel righteously indignant, and I basically act like a five year old. I almost invariably later on end up feeling like an idiot and a bad person for acting this way. This is a cycle that's been going on for the last few months, and it's getting worse. \n\nIs it \"all me\"? No, likely not. My wife can be picky, obsessive over details, when she's frustrated about something interpersonal between us, she likes to stomp around the kitchen and complain loudly about things (like where the salt shaker is, or how the milk wasn't put away properly). When her feelings are hurt, she wants me to own up to it immediately, even if it's something completely inadvertent I may have done (say, just ill-chosen words at the wrong time), and then she gets very picky and angry when she doesn't hear something she likes. Whatever. None of it is that big a deal, but she's tough to deal with sometimes. \n\nOne of the things I never forgot about my Mom was when I was divorcing my ex-wife, and my ex became extremely demanding about marital support and child support in ways that were clearly far beyond what was fair or equitable. My Mom stepped in and supported me 100% of the way, she was clearly on my side no matter what. This was despite the fact I was obviously to blame for at least part of why my marriage fell apart - she didnt care - my Mom was in \\*my\\* court. \n\nWell, that's over now. She died about twenty months ago. I remember I got a phone call from my Mom and Dad saying that my Mom's unexplained weird gastrointestinal symptoms for the last few weeks were explained now - she has stage 4 pancreatic cancer, for which there is no treatment and no cure, and she would be literally dead within 2-4 weeks. It was a nuclear bomb to my life. My main, undying support system, the glue that had held my life together for the last four-plus decades, was now about to get destroyed by a growth on her pancreas. \n\nMy Mom has been a linchpin in my life, through thick and thin, when things were going poorly and things were going well. And, truth be told, my Mom was always the glue that held things together. No matter what, she always was the once to call me if she hadn't heard from me in a few days or weeks. She was always there to check in with me. Always was my biggest cheerleader. \n\nOne of the things that really struck me about the time my Mom died was that my life was going in such a wonderful direction at that point, really, just, everything was going gangbusters. New relationship, had lost a good deal of weight, and I was feeling more confident, energetic, and happy than I really ever had been. Not to say I had my difficulties - my ex-wife (who is just crazy sometimes) still managed to cause me periodic stress and strain, but I managed to keep it in perspective. \n\nLike I said, I have so much to be thankful for, so many good things going on in my life. But yet it doesn't feel like much of anything right now. I told my wife the other night (after yet another gigantic, pointless fight that was supercharged by my seething anger) that I was feeling \"devoid.\" That was the best word I could come up with for how I feel right now. \"Devoid.\" \n\nSo, I've called my old therapist, I'm going to restart with her in the next week or so, hopefully. My wife and I have just started couples therapy for the first time. And, I will keep talking about how sad I feel, how \"devoid\" I feel, because going on and pretending I'm not ridiculously crushed, sad beyond belief my Mom is still gone is just stupid and ridiculous and lying to myself. \n\n&amp;#x200B;", "subreddit": "GriefSupport"}

She was diagnosed with M.S. 10ish years before I was born. When I was three she had a major relapse and never walked again. My parents divorced not long after and I grew up with my mother and brother. Now I'm living in Europe (in large part to get away from being her caregiver) and alone and trying to process her death.\n\nShe had another major relapse when I was in high school and lost almost all movement below her neck. My brother had already moved away, so I lived alone for a few months until my father found out (Thanksgiving dinner, funny enough). I ended up negotiating with both of my parents the transfer of my own custody and moved in with my father. She initially went to live with my grandmother with in-home nursing, but after a few months it became clear she needed to live in a nursing home to get 24-hour care.\n\nWhen I went to university, I chose to go back to Florida to be near her rather than take a scholarship in Montreal. If something were to happen, I'd at least be able to get there quickly. A few times in college I would get a call from my aunt or grandmother, and then rush across the state to spend the night in the ICU. I remember my second date with a girl being a four hour drive, a few hours in hospital, trying to decipher what my mother was saying behind a BPAP mask, and then getting Chinese takeout with my grandmother -- that was how she met my family. \n\nAfter graduating, I found a job in Tampa. Partly because that girlfriend was still in school, and partly because I could visit my mother more often. At least twice I rushed out of the office to cross town and be with her in the hospital. Full credit to my boss for giving me the flexibility he did. After two years I couldn't take it and left. The girlfriend and I broke up pretty painfully; my father re-married, re-divorced, had a nervous breakdown, and lived on my couch for a few months; I bought a motorcycle and was hit while stopped at a red light; and my mother's health slowly deteriorated. I found a job in Germany and took it. I spent the first year going back to the U.S. a few times because of some new life threatening illness.\n\nThe last time I saw her was in October 2018. She'd passed out from O2 deficiency, also crashing with some kind of UTI, and it looked like she wouldn't make it. I immediately booked the first flight I could afford and made it there in three days. By that time her sisters and my brother had also come, her health had improved, and it turned into a weirdly dire family reunion. Almost the entire family always felt like they'd appear when she was near death and then disappear once she stabilized, particularly my brother. I resented the whole thing. I took it as if I'd been screwed over, as if I walked away without the satisfaction of being next to her while she died.\n\nFeeling that way was ridiculous. I knew at the time it was a grotesque feeling that she should have died. I was resentful and quietly took it out on the whole family, including my mother. She deserved it the least. Of all people, she did not need to be reminded how difficult her situation was. We talked a few weeks ago, had an argument about my father, I argued with silence rather than openly fight. I got a call from my aunt last night that she died. She died alone, unable to call anyone's attention, and suddenly.\n\nHonestly I don't have many memories of my mother being \"motherly.\" I can't remember the last time she was able to hug me. What I do remember are the extraordinary lengths she went to to be there for me. \n\nI remember when I was young (maybe 7 or 8), I wanted Roller Coaster Tycoon 2 so damn badly. I wouldn't shut up about it. I rode on the back of her electric wheelchair maybe 2 miles to K-Mart so she could buy it for me. We made that trip tons of times, and the entire staff knew us well.\n\nI remember when I had a swim meet in high school (before her relapse), she rode alone maybe 3 miles to be there and to meet my teammates. I hated it, and I wanted her to just leave. God damn, I left without her and she rode back home alone. Just remembering that makes me want to slink out of my skin. She did something similar when I was in elementary school, but I don't remember what.\n\nNow I'm alone, with only a handful of friends in Germany, none of whom I want to bother with this sob story. I would get drunk in a bar and ramble to some stranger, but my German is nowhere near good enough to socialize. My girlfriend is traveling and won't be back for a week. By then I may have to go back for the celebration of life. I just wanted to lay this all out and let myself cry a bit. Thanks for reading if you made it this far.", "subreddit": "GriefSupport"}

We dated a few months and broke up due to circumstances that would have led her to move far away from me and we decided that without a way to see eachother regularly it wouldnt work. She then stayed, moved in with a new boyfriend, that turned very badly for her, we reconnected as friends, she realized with every visit (we were gym partners at this point) more and more how much she couldnt stand the guy she had dated after me and how much unresolved attraction we had. She broke up with him and we dated again. \n\nSorry for the extreme abridged near-year of backstory, feel free to ask more if you desire more detail. From here I want to share her story then my own. \n\nAt the time of us dating this time, she still roomed with her ex. She had a dog that meant the world to her and on her pay she couldnt afford to live alone, especially with trying to find a pet friendly place. Her ex initially appeared to understand and accept her leaving him but would then say and do things to try and \"fix things\" while implying they hadn't actually broken up. My Queen being the empathic and very caring woman she was kept reminding him that they werent together but felt guilty that someone else was hurting because of her (regardless of the fact that she had no control on the situation. I had witnessed her break down crying because of how guilty she felt). She was also very anxious to tell her family or friends about everything because she was afraid they would think negatively of her. So she left the social media statuses unchanged and posted no pictures of us. We made plans to move in come April and have our own place, I felt it was a little soon but I knew what she was going through and I would rather have her near where I could take care if her, since she always took care of everyone else. \n\nFor me, at the time of us being back together i quit from an industry that i loved, that had largely been where i got my confidence and will to live from. It wasnt a good thing for me and i decided i could be better. I was in and out of several jobs, always broke, barely getting by. The stress of this hit my depression bad enough to make me nearly suicidal, i remember spending 8 hours in my car waiting for a postmates delivery to post to me and thinking about what would happen to everyone around me if I did. And the answer was largely nothing. Yeah, there would be a lot of confusion and grieving but no one would be different for it, so I thought. I saw my Queen the next day and the moment I saw how she looked at me I realized I had to do whatever it took to get back to my normal self. Her eyes showed she saw right through me and knew the pain I was in, and that it would all work out. She started to help me financially which I had never been comfortable accepting but I knew I would pay her back somehow. \n\nShe showed me how to see myself positively, how to appreciate the world around me and see the wonder in the world. She had a lust for life and for experiences and it bled into everything around her. She was the most beautiful person I've ever met and somehow she saw me like that as well. I have no idea what I did to deserve such an otherworldly kind of love but i had found it. She actually made me believe I deserved to be happy and that she would always be here to give it to me. \n\nA couple weeks ago I woke up and hadn't heard from her. Normally I'd get off work and she would be asleep so I sent her some voice messages talking about how my shift was and how excited I was to house hunt with her, how when we moved in I would make sure she felt like the Queen i saw her as. I woke up the next morning far later than normal, and still hadn't heard from her. She hadn't even been online in almost a day which was extremely out of character. I knew she was at the beach the day before so I checked Google with a bad feeling\n\nI saw then that 2 young women and a dog had been caught in a landslide and one of the women had been presumed killed. The dog and one women were saved. I recognized her friend from a shot of her in the back of a car being taken to the hospital. That was the first moment in my life I felt cold to my core. I immediately drove out with my father to that beach to help but the search was postponed due to unstable conditions. My Queen was never found and I was left broken\n\nIt's been a few weeks now and I feel largely functional again. I'm returning to work tomorrow, I can have normal conversations, and I'm slowly eating and sleeping more again. Losing her was my worst fear and I'm living it out. \n\nThe worst part of all of this is because she was scared her friends and family would think I'll of her for it, she never changed her online statuses or pictures so her family deliberately pushed me away, knowing I was part of the true story of her but that it may look bad. This has torn me up because from what I've been able to tell only her dad really understood how amazing she was and I saw her go from amazing to an absolute angel. Through her will and my support (according to her) she conquered an eating disorder she only recently realized she had, she was slowly coming off anti-depressants and weed in favor of exercise and activity (though she did keep a very honest dialog with me and herself to make sure she had the help she needed when she needed it), she grew more confident and felt she deserved more than the live she had been living. \n\nI never got to and will never be able to share this amazing woman with the people who supposedly cared the most about her. Her loss and the hole she left in my soul were rough, but seeing the people who claimed to love her treat her as some average person who tragically passed is driving me insane. \n\nI wanted to link the videos I have of her the last night we spent together. I knew she was stressed so I tried to help her relax by making breakfast for dinner, giving her a full body massage, and watching some silly rom com together. Her memories, while painful, continue to be happy ones and ones I want to share. Out of respect for her and my own privacy, if youd like to share this memory with me I will be happy to send the link in a PM, but will not post it\n\nBecause I always called her my queen, and I want to get a tattoo to remind me why I am enacting the changes (getting out and adventuring more, meeting more people, daily yoga practice and taking better care of myself, to name a few) I am. I have been thinking of getting a warrior or knight of some kind kneeling before an empty throne that is partially buried in sand. It seems a little too hard for me right now to add the sand but I think the fact that the imagery of it does hit me so hard adds to it", "subreddit": "GriefSupport"}

It was her birthday she was 56.  We had been married a few months over 10 years.  I told people I married her on Halloween as I had been married before and it was the scariest thing I could think of doing.  We met online but not in a typical way or fashion, our relationship was also not typical so explaining to most people is not possible.  About the only person I can talk with is her daughter who is also grieving and there are many things she does not want to know.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI long to hold my wife in my arms so I can fall asleep.  I keep having nightmares waking up at odd hours and having trouble falling asleep.  She was my friend, my wife and my lover and she was ripped away from me.  My heart physically hurts now that she is gone, I am heartbroken.  I had to have someone come help me clean out the bathroom that she used because when I went in there all I could do was turn circles and her daughter will probably need a place to stay for the memorial.  I had to remove a special seat that I made from the toilet and started having a panic attack.  At one point I started choking and dry heaving.  I have been with someone almost constantly for over twenty years and now it's just me and our dog.  I love on him and hold him as much as I can but he gets hot and goes to lay down where he is comfortable.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe one thing I feel the most is the desire to be held or hold someone while I sleep.  I just want physical contact I hate being alone.  I lost my son almost 17 years ago but I had my ex there with me and the depression was worse in some ways but I had someone there.  I'm almost 40 now and part of me feels like I will always be alone from now on and it scares the crap out of me.  I keep talking to my wife even though she is gone just to try and feel a connection.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI had to make up her memorial cards for Saturday and tomorrow I need to put together some pictures of her to play at her memorial, I made a collage that I need to have printed off hopefully they can do it tomorrow.  I don't want to be there.... To me that is not how I will ever remember her.  I feel like going to the Wichita Mountains refuge where we were able to have one of our first outings together and talk to her while looking through pictures and listening to songs that were important to us.  Her daughter wants to go with me but she doesn't understand that we each have separate memories and what I will remember will be a different person from her.  I want to go alone but I also don't want to deny her daughter the chance to see her mother through my eyes. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOn top of everything I am unable to work due to a disability and my monthly income is barely enough to pay the rent let alone the bills and buy food.  I am trying to get help but I am having a tough time getting things done.  I have had a few people offer to help but that only works for so long and I hate the thought I may be taking something from them or their family so that I can live.  I have posted elsewhere on reddit when things first happened, it won't be hard to find.

He was diagnosed with Prostate cancer when I was 16. I remember him promising me that most men died with it and not because of it. I truly believed him because I had no reason not to.\n\nI never spent a week without seeing my Nana and Pops, and as a child, my brother and I stayed over and spent every weekend with them. All of my holidays were even spent with them. \n\nIn 2014, he became worse. Everyone kept refering to his terminal illness and I refused to believe anyone. I even laughed it off and called people stupid; there was no way this was killing him. Every time I went to visit him in hospital, he would be sat fully dressed in his chair, out of bed whilst everyone else was dying around him. He was always so energetic and I was so happy because I *knew* everyone was wrong about him. \n\nIn June 2014, he became paralysed from the waist down as the radiotherapy had crumbled his spine. This didn't seem to bother him at all. Things very quickly started to get worse. My Nana brought him home and turned their dining room into his bedroom and installed specialist equipment to look after him. His skin went yellow and he became very thin. He had always enjoyed good food and wine so he always had a belly, and even now I still refused to believe it was getting worse. \n\nI stopped going down to see him so much because I couldn't bear to see him like that, and I thought \"I'll wait until he gets better and looks normal again!\". When I did force myself to go down, I'd take my little dog and he'd hop up on Pops' bed and fall asleep on him. My Nana still reminds me how much Pops loved my dog. \n\nWe went down on Christmas 2015 and he was in his wheelchair surrounded by his family and I remember taking one look at him and having to leave the room to force myself to not cry. I managed a couple of hours before I couldn't bear it any longer. I gave him the tightest hug I have ever given anyone and I told him that I loved him so much. He held on so tight and he told me he knew how much I loved him, and that he loved me very much too. I cried as I walked home. \n\nThe next week, Mum and Dad came home and told my brother and I that he was hallucinating and that he'll be gone soon. I said \"Well he has to get worse before he gets better\" and I believed it. Nobody argued with me. He died the following evening. I don't remember much but my Mum and Dad said when they told me, I collapsed on the floor in tears and started shaking. I wouldn't respond to them so they left me to go back to Nana and sort things out. \n\nI started a new job the next day and like an idiot, I went without delaying my start date. I had sleep paralysis for the first time that week. \n\nI refused to go to his funeral. Nobody forced me or argued with me. They all understood why I didn't go. \n\nA year later, I took time off work because I had convinced myself I was fatally ill. My counsellor at the time recognised this as not coming to terms with his death and my grief manifesting itself in different ways. We worked to get over this and apart from the odd bout of anxiety and random panic attack, I'm proud to say I've come out mostly undamaged. \n\nI am having dreams now. Pops is in them and he's his old happy self and we're surrounded by the rest of our family. Everyone is so happy except for me. I look at him beaming exactly as I remember him, and I'm so angry. I ask him why he's acting as though nothing is wrong and he just smiles and ignores the question. I'm so happy to see him but I'm so furious with him. I hug him tightly and he feels real, and I can smell what he smelled like. I'm crying on him and I feel so much pain and he asks me why I'm upset and I tell him it's because he left us and he just laughs it off. \n\nI had one again last night and it's knocked me on my arse today. I know they're not real but I miss him so much but I'm so angry. I've had two counsellors in the last 4 years for this and I always feel better for a short time and then it all starts right back up again. \n\nHas anyone else experienced this kind of dream? I'm rubbish at dealing with my emotions. I tend to bottle them up until I explode and then I have to deal with the fallout. \n\nIt must be said, my partner and I are currently living with his Mum after we had some issues with our previous landlord (absolutely not our fault) and I'm in the last three weeks of my notice period for this job I loathe after four years, as I'm about to go self employed.

They got it down, but then a week later, everything started to fail before she passed away.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe've all had issues, as would anyone, but my issue is my mom.  She's taking it extra hard, as would any mother.  Mom had to take care of my little sister ALL her life due to sister being mentally handicapped (she was 30's, but had the mind of a mature child) and she looked like she was a child.  But I think my mom is going crazy.  We've visited my sister's grave almost every day since.  I say we because it's usually me and her going, or if she can't go, then it's me and my dad.  She insists that someone goes EVERY DAY to see her.  If we don't she breaks down, getting upset about she thinks that if no one visits her every day, she will feel abandoned.  She flipped out on us once because we didn't and made me and my dad takes a picture to prove we went.  She also asks God every day to give her back.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI have tried to tell her that it won't happen, but she gives me that look that a kid gives you when you tell them Santa isn't real; the look of \"why do you want to make me sad.\"  I have argued that if she was in Heaven, in Paradise, would she want to come back to this horrible planet?\"  Her response is always \"...if I missed my mommy.\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI am so worried that Mom is going to go insane or hurt herself.  I have tried to get her to go to grief counseling, but she refuses.  She doesn't want to sit with a bunch of strangers and cry.  I got her to go to church, but it seems she just goes to show up.  I have tried to get our pastor to visit her, but he's too busy to do so.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI pray every night that God will help her, that my little sister will come to her and tell things will be okay.  Tell her something, anything, that will help her.  I worry every day that I'll come home and find her dead because she wanted to see her again.  Or that she goes insane and I have to have her committed.  I am just scared.  I don't know what to do.", "subreddit": "GriefSupport"}

I'm not entirely sure whether this post would go against the subreddit rules, but I could really do with a bit of help for some research I'm conducting for a new project of mine. (TL;DR below)\n\nI'm studying Interior and Spacial Design at uni and my latest brief is redesign an old building to create a safe space to combat loneliness. I myself have dealt with it in the past after the untimely passing of my uncle. He was more like an older brother to me as he was closer to my age than to my dad, so when he died I spiralled a bit. I isolated myself from friends and family to the point where I ended up breaking down and not attending my college classes for over a month. I was lonely and depressed and I never want to go back to that place again. Its been just over 2 years now since my breakdown and the recovery process has been long and tiring but now I'm on the mend and I want to create the best space I can for this project. I could use my own experiences, but to create the most effective space possible I need to talk to as many people as possible.\n\nI'm thinking about creating this space to help combat loneliness primarily in those who have suffered from the loss of a loved one and are still in the process of grieving. For this I need to know what people would like in a in a space solely dedicated to helping them. Despite my focus on post-loss loneliness, input from anyone suffering will be greatly welcomed regardless of situation.\n\n**In essence, all I'm asking is that if you were to go to a designated space designed to help you combat your loneliness; a place where you can meet with other people also suffering; a calm and welcoming space just for you; what would you want? This can be anything from optional therapy, comfortable spaces, games etc etc.**\n\nSorry the post has been long! If you aren't comfortable responding on this thread, I'll happily answer direct messages. Wishing you all the best :)\n\nTL;DR: If you had the option to go to a space designated to combat loneliness, what would you want in that space?", "subreddit": "GriefSupport"}

Me and Laura grew up together, had all the same interests, and we just got each other. She was the one person who always knew when I was upset, I swear she could even tell through text message, I have no idea how but she always knew; and she always knew exactly what to say to make me laugh. All through middle school and high school we spent every single weekend with either her at my house or me at her house. Laura was the impulsive, wild one who got me to come out of my shell, I was the collected, rational one who stopped her from getting in trouble, we just clicked.\n\nAt 20 (just before her 21st birthday) Laura was a crazy party girl until she found out she was pregnant. I was a bit worried that my crazy, impulsive friend might not be ready for this; I mean we were only 20, still young and stupid. I was by her side through a lot of it supporting her though. She didn't want to go to one of her ultrasounds alone when the 'father' (more like sperm donor) was pissed at her, so I went, and hearing that little heartbeat brought tears to my eyes. Laura, being typical, smiled at me and called me a 'dork', then said \"isn't it the most beautiful sound you've ever heard?\" I couldn't agree more, it's still the most beautiful sound I've heard. She didn't want to go alone to breastfeeding class, so I went with her. Then when the 'father' left Laura alone in the hospital after having her C-section (so she wasn't supposed to really get up) I was the one she called to spend the night with her and help her take care of the baby. When he ignored her calls I was the one who drove Laura and her son home.\n\nI let Laura settle in for a few days and told her to let me know when she was ready for guests or if she needed help. I spent a lot of time there in the beginning helping her and falling head over heels for this beautiful little boy she'd brought into the world. She'd take a nap and I'd handle the little man, if they were both down for a nap I'd clean the bathroom or wash the dishes for her. She never asked me to help, just to hang out because many of her other friends thought she was \"boring\", I was happy to help though and she'd always be beyond grateful (she wasn't taking advantage). I watched my crazy friend develop into the most loving, nurturing, wonderful mother a child could ask for.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLaura passed away at 26, her son is 5 years old. I miss her so much, but more than that I feel for her son. His dad hasn't been involved since he was 6 months old; he hasn't shown up to a single birthday, father's day, nothing. All he had for a parent was his mommy and now she's gone.", "subreddit": "GriefSupport"}

My problem is that I'm picking up on a certain impatience and/or reductiveness from the counselor I selected. After our first session, he gave me this \"multimodal questionnaire\" which required me to score insensitive prompts like \"My parents interfere in my marriage.\" (Nope: gone, gone, and gone.) Or, another one \"What could you tell me that would shock me? (Maybe that I'd like a shock-proof counselor?)  Right away, I asked him if this questionnaire was a precondition for grief counseling, and he said it wasn't, but since then he occasionally harps on the fact that I didn't provide it, last week observing that without it counseling is \"like molasses.\" He requires me to fill out a brief questionnaire before every single session, ranking my current mood/thoughts on a one-to-five scale and counting up the total scores. (Since last week, my inclination to harm myself remains at zero and regarding whether I've \"felt irritable\" since then: how about a 2.25? \\[which is likely to rise each week I have to answer this\\].)\n\nIn the most recent session (our third one), he began insisting that I am acting out \"schemas\" of mistrust from my childhood. (\"I'm TELLING you\" that's what's going on, he said at one point.)  I felt defensive, but didn't strenuously object; I have no extra wind in my sails. For sure, my childhood home was dysfunctional, but I really can't lay blame for how I feel right now on my parents, who were victims of familial dysfunction themselves and have been gone for decades. Given how I've felt lately, I experience this kind of \"intervention\" as an assault, but I have tried to approach my own defensiveness with a grain of salt right now. I'm no kid, I don't lack insight and I am not against critically examining my past. But I feel like my current pain is fairly straightforward: I MISS MY LIFE PARTNER. I want to process this pain with someone professional until it hurts less. Is THIS \"counseling\" or some kind of paint-by-numbers \"treatment plan\"? I've thought of just not returning to this counselor, but I hurt and need help with this.

( grandmother passed when i was 15 or 16 after trying to stay in contact with me on facebook. parents are divorced and have been for my whole life. ) \n\ni\u2019m giving this context so you can understand my attachment. he was a father figure to me in the 8-9 years he stayed at the house i live at, but he ultimately left after divorcing my grandmother and moved across the state. he later owned a dog and cat and found himself a girlfriend. despite this, he still insisted on seeing us every summer whether he came down or we came up. we didn\u2019t come up too often, but i would see him for my brother\u2019s birthday at least. \n\nwhen i was 13-14 ( 18 now ) he had saved up enough for us to go to yellowstone, and that was one of the last big moments i had with him. it was an wonderful week and i\u2019ll never forget the experience, even if i didn\u2019t get to see the wolves. i am eternally grateful to him for it as it was wonderful, even if it was long awaited. he tried to do things with me when he was in town after that, but the timing was never right. i never told him how much i cherished that trip and the offer he tried to make a few years after to go to the museum after he shot down my suggestion of one of the zoo\u2019s around here for his girlfriends physical health. i had to have my wisdom teeth pulled and wasn\u2019t really in a state to head to the museum during his stay, sadly. \n\nfast forward to summer of 2017, when the eclipse happened. \n\nmy grandpa was sat on the couch drinking and talking away. i had showed him the nintendo switch i had just gotten and he was smiling as he told me that the video games were just advancing more and more graphically when i showed him breath of the wild. i can\u2019t remember all the details after that, but i do remember him talking about when he dies. this was one of those warning signs i mentioned, and i remember he said to my grandmother something along the lines of: \u201ci have no regrets. i\u2019ve done all i\u2019ve wanted to do, i\u2019ll die happy.\u201d i remember before this he\u2019d also talked about one of the mountains he climbed, but his talk of death had worried me too much to care.\n\n\nhis health started to decline around christmas time. my grandma urged me to send him a card - something, anything to him, but i didn\u2019t. i procrastinated on it and to this day i still regret not sending him the damn christmas card or even signing one. we ended up going to his town in march - april of 2018, i can\u2019t remember the events are so blurry in my head. it was so surreal to be told that he was dying and i had to see him with my aunt, uncle and grandma. \n\nno one prepared me. no one thought to tell the seventeen year old who only witnessed death with her beloved animals over the years that her grandfather had deteriorated over the few short months it had been since she\u2019d last seen him in august. i was the first one to walk into the room, almost excited because i didn\u2019t expect him to look the way he did. but i remember my heart dropping when i came in at 1-2 AM after a frantic drive over and thinking that it wasn\u2019t him. this wasn\u2019t him, this wasn\u2019t the man i admired and looked up to for all my life. this wasn\u2019t him, this wasn\u2019t my grumpy fisherman grandfather who\u2019d drank a little too much. this was a skeleton of a man who had jaundice and sunken in eyes and could barely hear or talk. \n\ni was silent through the whole visit. a shaking nervous wreck who sat right across from him and always looked away when he made eye contact because i didn\u2019t know what else to do. i don\u2019t know how long we visited him, time slipped from me but i do remember looking at the bag connected to the catheter he had and seeing black liquid and knowing it was over and that he lost this fight with himself. he kept looking at me, wanting to say something and to comfort me, i knew it. but i remained as composed as i could and wiped my eyes and tried to smile for him because you\u2019re supposed to comfort the dying, not the other way around. \n\nwhen we got to the hotel i didn\u2019t sleep good. his face was stuck in my head and i just laid there and softly sobbed when everyone else was asleep and i don\u2019t remember what happened after that. i just remember it hurt so much and it scared me so much. we visited him the next day when he could actually respond. he sounded weak and tired and after all of that i couldn\u2019t blame him. but i remember clearly that my grandma had asked him if the swab ( i\u2019m not sure what it was, i just knew it was soaked in water and that he\u2019d been drinking like that for however long he was in the nursing home &amp; hospital. ) tasted good. he looked at her, took it out of his mouth and in the most normal tone he had spoken to use since we arrived he said: \u201cIt tastes like shit.\u201d \n\ni laughed. i couldn\u2019t help it, he was just him again and that moment was so wonderful. i held back tears and visited him without many words, but he did say he liked my hat in a clearer tone than the one he\u2019d been using since we saw him. i smiled and told him thanks, wanting to say smth sarcastic of \u201c i like it too \u201c and eventually we left after promising to see him the following sunday after i managed to choke out an i love you to him since i was too afraid to touch him, thinking i\u2019d break him. it was around monday or sunday when we saw him and he had specifically asked us to come back. i felt hope swell in my heart at that and the idea that he could make it.\n\nhe died wednesday. \n\ni had gotten to my room and sobbed my heart out when i found out. my friends tried to help by starting a walking group so i could get out of the house and focus my grief elsewhere and my family didn\u2019t really help since they just told me he wouldn\u2019t want me to cry and the same goddamn bullshit they gave to me when a pet died. i spent many nights wide awake in my dark room alone, sobbing my heart out and i still do. \n\ni\u2019m still not over it despite all the jokes i make and despite all the time that\u2019s passed. it terrifies me, death absolutely terrifies me now. the idea of leaving someone the way he left us is terrifying - especially when i don\u2019t believe in god and knowing he didn\u2019t either is worse. i have vivid dreams and nightmares where he didn\u2019t die or i see him again and i get to hug him again or he tells me its just a dream, he\u2019s not there and never will be again. it hurts so badly when i wake up and sometimes he just crosses my mind and i just lay in bed and sob despite knowing he didn\u2019t want grief, he didn\u2019t want this. \n\ni can\u2019t help it. its why i came to here, because i needed to write my feelings down and have someone else read them so maybe i can heal a little. i love my grandpa and always will but i can\u2019t help but feel angry that he was so self destructive and left us this way, even when i know i can\u2019t be angry with him. the nightmares have been more vivid with the time i\u2019ve been forced to spend around hospitals ( i\u2019m chronically ill with type one diabetes, my great uncle is currently staying here due to diabetes complications having made him need two toes removed and my aunt was hospitalized due to medical issues immediately after my grandfather passed. ) \n\ni didn\u2019t know where else to post and vent as i\u2019m not allowed to see a therapist due to my family members and i feel like i just upset people around me when i talk about him despite the fact i think the events left permanent trauma. god i just wish i could see him again and do things over, but i know i can\u2019t and i know this isnt what he wanted but it\u2019s happening and i\u2019m tired. this helped a little at least, so thank you. \n\ni miss him and i really hope my belief\u2019s are wrong if it means i get to see him face to face again in a reality that isn\u2019t a dream.

I don't think she realized she was being aggressive, she would just flip a switch and end up causing real harm. We chose against rehoming because no one would go to the lengths that we did.

Never watched someone die. Never had anyone close to me die. Never had someone die unexpectedly. This has all changed very recently. \n\nIn December, my grandma died. This one has by far affected me the most. I loved her so dearly, my biological mother was never in my life and my grandma took over. We were so close and even now, three months later, there are still moments I\u2019ll think of her and break down. \n\nThe second one wasn\u2019t really my fault, but at the same time, depending on who you ask, it was. He was a stranger. I\u2019m a nursing student and my charge nurse told me she had a patient that needed a feeding tube inserted because he had not ate in three days. I had never done this before and it was before I saw who it was, so I happily agreed to do it. \n\nMy instructor pulled me aside and warned me that there was a chance he may die within 24 hours or so. The order was because the doctor believed that hydration would possibly prolong his life. \n\nI went in the room with two other students who wanted to watch the procedure, my instructor, my charge nurse, and the director of nursing. He was having Cheyne Stokes respirations, which is the type of breathing that mean death is coming soon. All of three of them still agreed on the tube insertion. \n\nI got the tube in successfully, but he was gone before we actually were able to start the feeding. I\u2019ve talked to other nurses and instructors who all agreed that the order should have been for an IV which would have been much more dignified, and the IV should have been started way before he went three days without getting any fluids. The poor guy was in his 80s and had no family on file. All he had listed was the mortuary. \n\nThe last one happened this morning. I woke up to hear the fire department banging on my neighbor across the hall\u2019s door. He was my favorite neighbor, the absolute sweetest guy. \n\nHe called 911 on himself. He was surrounded by a few empty gallon vodka bottles. They took him in and a few hours later, his girlfriend told me he died. We believe it was intentional, he has attempted suicide before and had a very serious alcohol problem. \n\nI don\u2019t know where I\u2019m going with this. I\u2019m just sad.

I am mean absolute GAME FACE  - 100% - Let's fucking go ... you are not getting in the way of \"ME\" getting my money. They were repulsed at the notion of him leaving his kids an inheritance.  \n\n\nAs I cried, gave my dad CBD oil, prayed to god over and over again for my father to come back to health, they actually told me \"They want the CBD to work so that he could communicate\". What does that mean, you ask? It meant to talk to him about MONEY and then he could go die.   \n\n\nI remember the last day he was ever in his house before the permanent hospital stay, the girlfriend was pissing herself with excitement. Could not even sit still when the ambulance came. My older brother was taking care of the process, my sister and I were on the porch - totally inconsolable. Crying like we've never felt before, the absolute fear of hell and \"It's over\" like I have never felt before..... the girlfriend striking up conversations with the paramedics, laughing, huge smile, almost as if to say \"Finally! It paid off! He's going to die and I am cashing out!\".  \n\n\nWell, my father left it to us and I will tell you what - It's good to not be dead broke, but you know what's worse? Being 26 without a father. I cannot stop thinking back to his last months / days and realizing that these human beings could make my fathers death about money.

Literally NO emotion to my siblings or I when he died. They ruined the last days with my father.   \n\n\nHell, my half brother even came late to the funeral, refused to stand in line and greet people, waiting in the lobby as I delivered the eulogy and then corned me in a private room after the funeral, only to say \"So what's the deal? How is the payout working?\". The kid NEVER VISITED MY FATHER ONCE in the hospital or at home when my father was dying. Even told me \"What was I gonna do, sit there with him?

But by some miracle there was a day or so in the cancer treatment center where he was conscious and aware and I was able to speak with him.\n\n He ended up going into hospice, due to the widespread nasty disease. I sat by his side for hours when I could. He used to point at me in a funny way and make some joke with me, and he tried to do it to me I assume to show he knew it was me next to him. The silence was so heavy the night before he passed. He was so tired and weak. He couldnt speak. My grandmother played his favorite music by him and he just shut his eyes and rested. He was tired, so tired. \n\nThrough December I was fairly inactive on discord and etc so I lost a few internet friends I thought were really close, instead they moved on I guess.. which that really sucked too. \n\nanyway, please, regularly get yourself checked at the doctor. \nHug your parents, grandparents or family members in general. tell them you love them.

(Sorry if my grammar and punctuation is horrible.  English is my first language, but I really love commas.)  Also, I'm really sorry this is a long post.  I feel like backstory only makes you understand everything that went down during this time. \n\nI've experienced grief before, break-ups, losing a job, a pet, a friendship, a grandparent; but nothing could have ever prepared me for the type of grief I felt when I lost my mom. \n\nSome backstory on my mom, she had a lot of mental disorders, depression, anxiety, bipolar disorder, alcoholism, we suspected schizophrenia too, it ran in her family her mom has it.  She started drinking around 2015, before I graduated from high school.  I didn't really realize it was a problem until May of 2016, when she attempted suicide.  It wasn't her first suicide attempt, but it was the first I knew about.  My step-dad oddly enough wanted to keep her struggles on the downlow, he didn't want to bother the rest of the family with what was happening.  After that attempt I dropped out of college, I wanted to be closer to home thinking maybe that if I was home her problems would disappear.  I was 19, almost 20, terrified I was going to lose her.  My mom and I were always close, we had our fights like any normal mother daughter duo would, but she was one of my best friends.  She understood me, understood how I felt with my own mental disorders... I was a lot like her (minus the schizophrenia and alcoholism), I called her whenever I had an anxiety attack and she'd always talk me down.  That all stopped when she tried to end her life, I thought I'd take the burden off her and I stopped coming to her when I had problems.  Her drinking spiraled, attempts at taking her life increased.  The two were hand in hand, drinking led to her being suicidal.  She never tried to take her life when she was sober.  So the years went on, she'd be arrested for driving under the influence, resisting arrest.. That whole thing, the cops only kept her until she was sober enough to go home.  Closer to the end, she was arrested nearly 2x a week.  We kept telling the cops to keep her, that she was a risk to herself.  They'd never keep her, they'd release her my step dad would take her home and then they'd charge her with something like bail jumping, and the cycle continued.  I have no idea how many times that happened.  \n\nShe died on Friday July 27, 2018.  The following Monday she had a court date.  She was supposed to show up and they were going to determine basically where she was going to go.  She thought she was going to be facing jail time, my step dad didn't tell her but he was going to try and push for a psychiatric ward in a hospital and a rehab center... She wasn't a criminal, she just had a drinking problem and mental disorders.  It was really a normal day, I had the day off work so I went to her house to spend the day with her because I didn't know when I'd see her again after Monday.  She was drinking, I remember I was upset about that.  She knew how uncomfortable it made me, but she was drinking.  At one point my little sister said to be nice to her and let her drink.  My sisters didn't care that she drank so much, or they avoided the problem.  I saw the problem and I HATED when she drank because so many times she'd promise to get help.  I went and drove her around town at one point to put up garage sale signs, and I backed up into a car at one point (no damage to either vehicles) after that she told me to bring her home because obviously I couldn't be trusted to drive her around anymore.  The last thing I remember from that drive home was her singing Amazing Grace in the passenger seat.  I was annoyed because before she was obnoxious and yelling in my ear and being her drunk self.  We got home, and it's a blur from when we got home, and when she left on her own.  My step dad got home from, and I went to the bathroom.  I didn't talk to my mom after we got home, I know that.  I remember watching her from the garage step off the patio, stagger towards her truck, she didn't look at me.  When she drove away I called 911 to report a drunk driver. Figured they'd find her before she did something stupid.  They knew the call, they received it from us a couple times before.  I left it at that, told my step dad and he said the cops would call when they arrested her and he'd pick her up later.  It was an hour later when I decided I'd drive around to the parks and see if she was there, she liked to hide out there.  I was just driving to my car when a cop pulled in.  I remember being relieved, they found her, she's safe.  He pulled my step dad aside and I was watching this, and my step dad's knees quivered and he turned away from the cop.  I remember so clearly saying, \"You have to tell me, I'm her daughter.\"  He told me that my mom was involved in a head on collision with a semi truck, I asked him if she was okay and he told me that she wasn't... Then I asked him if she would be okay he told me that she wouldn't be.  He never flat out said it, he never said \"Your mom died.\"  Everything after that was a blur, of crying and screaming and being so weak I couldn't get off the ground.  I feel like I should say this now, the semi driver was not harmed whatsoever in this accident.  I had to call my dad, then I had to call my sisters and I had to get them there now, but I didn't want them to drive.  I kept asking to see her.  I couldn't believe it.  I let her go, I let her get in the car, knowing better.  I let her go.  I hated myself, my sisters wouldn't look at me.  My moms family came and we cried and everyone cried and cursed at the world for taking away this person that was so deeply important to us.  I hate myself everyday for not stopping her.  I blame myself, and I think that if I stopped her we'd have her in our lives still. \n\nUltimately, her death was ruled a suicide.  We told the cops that she was suicidal.  I believe that it was a suicide.  Some days, I'm so overcome with grief I can't breathe.  I wake up at night sometimes crying, or calling out \"mom.\"  I go to therapy, I went to grief support.  And I'm cutting this short because I don't know if anyone will even read this, and I'm crying while at work.  It's hard to talk about this out loud, it's easier to type, but reliving it is hard. \n\nThank you for letting me get this off my chest.  ", "subreddit": "GriefSupport"}

Please help.", "author": "mbk--", "self_text": "I (22F) lost my mom early Morning morning. She had very aggressive cancer, and was 52 years old. I took a leave of absence from grad school and spent the last month of her life with her full-time in the hospital. By that I mean I didn\u2019t go outside for weeks at a time, lost track of the days, slept only lightly and very little to spring up to my feet when the need arose in the middle of the night. I was an emotional wreck, too. Deeply, deeply depressed and unable to give sense to what was happening. I kept imagining what my life would be like without her, in as great detail as I could, and spiraled into more and more despair. I lost around 15 lbs in this month. I constantly cried and experienced what I presume is the deepest kind of sorrow I\u2019m capable of feeling. Things only got worse when around 2 weeks before she passed, she started to become more and more delirious and confused. She was just so completely discombobulated and confused about everything around her. She sometimes didn\u2019t know what was happening, didn\u2019t understand why we were in the hospital, and kept repeating to herself, \u201cokay, so what\u2019s next?\u201d in anticipation. I would quietly break down whenever I saw her innocently staring at the clock and asking me, \u201cso what are we waiting for?\u201d, or \u201ccan we go home\u201d, or referring to the many tubes connected to her body as \u201cboxes\u201d. She didn\u2019t understand what they were. She was so uncomfortable and pained towards the end. Our oncologist told us that patients with this kind of disease usually have a peaceful end of life transition, but that was really far from it for us. I wonder if that\u2019s our fault. Her mouth kept getting dry so she always asked for water; as for food, we maybe gave her altogether half a spoon of some purred food in one day. But everyone told us that as the body gets close to shutting itself down, it stops asking for food and water to have an easier transition, and that any nutrition might actually make things worse. I wonder if that\u2019s what happened. I wonder if we should\u2019ve kept the food and water away from her. In the last few nights, I would stay awake next to her, just keeping track of her breathing, timing each breath, obsessively looking for any subtle signs that she might be close. Then one night, my younger sister (who had not visited my mom all that much) decided to stay in the hospital, and her and my dad tried to convince me to go home and get a solid night of sleep. I was a little frustrated that my sister could just come by whenever she feels like it, but wasn\u2019t truly invested or very helpful, so I resisted a little and got into it with them. Eventually I did leave\u2014I stormed out of the room, not giving my mom a kiss or telling her I loved her. This was my first time in weeks stepping foot inside the house, laying on a real bed. Then at 4 am we get a call from her saying mom has stopped breathing. I rush everyone to the hospital in the midst of a panic, we all sprint upstairs, and there she is. Her body, still, lifeless. Her hands and neck are still warm. My sister sobbing over her, my dad praying and sobbing. I didn\u2019t get to say goodbye. The last thing I did in her presence was to get mad at my sister and dad and storm out of the room. So much for maturity. Anyway. Here is where I am really looking for advice: in the following few days (including today) I really haven\u2019t cried all that much. I know what grief feels like from having hardcore anticipatory grief, but I haven\u2019t felt it. That deep, inescapable sorrow is nowhere to be found. What is happening? Have I over prepared myself for this? Have I already done my grieving? Every time I think of her, really think of her, I catch a glimpse of that sorrow but then a sturdy wall comes up, blocking my sight from it. What is wrong with me? I used believe that I would never be happy again, would get complicated grief, and would likely be suicidal. Because that\u2019s how terrible I had been feeling throughout the last month of her disease. But now it\u2019s like there\u2019s a mental fortress around me hindering those natural feelings of grief and sadness any access. And I want them back. I know how terrible they feel, but they\u2019re ultimately an expression of my love and I feel so guilty without them. I used to only want to feel better soon and to not grieve too strongly or for too long, but now I want just the opposite. Sorry for the long text, I just figured some context was important. Another thing is, per tradition, lots and lots of people keep coming to our house (for the following 7 days) with food and help and prayers. So maybe amidst all of this chaos and crowdedness I haven\u2019t had a chance to really let what happened sink in. Anyway. I would just appreciate any guidance about what I\u2019m going through right now. Thank you. ", "subreddit": "GriefSupport"}

I saw it before with my other grandmother and I knew it was coming as Ive already made myself familiar with the symptoms that are present as the end is approaching.

I dont know why, but this time it feels much worse than with my other grandmother even though that it seems as I was prepared for it....she knew she was dying, she even said it few hours before she passed.

Again.\n\n2 years and I guess technically yesterday, was her murderers sentencing. He was a military man. Making his body a deadly weapon. \n\nA plea deal of 45 years, only requiring him to serve half his sentence in order to be eligible for parole for use of a deadly weapon. \n\n27 years old. Meaning by 50 years old, on good behavior, he\u2019s released. Not to mention that her mother saw compassion for her and her family from him in the court room. Maybe he\u2019ll be good and maybe he\u2019ll get out in enough time to enjoy the last half of his pathetic life. Maybe he\u2019ll lose control and kill again. This isn\u2019t the first time he physically abused a partner. Would it really be the last?\n\nI\u2019m struggling. I held a fundraiser this year and last year for our local DVIP and recounted the inspiring, motivated and headstrong young woman she was. I can\u2019t let her die. I wont. Cliche I know.\n\nShe was a trained Irish step dancer. He murdered her the week of a holiday most important to her and her family. A holiday that was a marker for her to shine in her glory of careful steps, curly blonde wigs and traditional costumery.\n\nHe took away an artist of composition and intelligence that understood life too well, without ever experiencing it. Her fingers graced a piano with delicate passion, her soprano notes never missing an octave. The darkness creeping ever so beautifully from her aura because let\u2019s be honest, everything isn\u2019t fine all the time and that was okay. It was the coal to ignite the fire.\n\nI\u2019m angry still though. I feel no fate of forgiveness, despite her mother telling me to do otherwise but he did not repent. He did not confess. I\u2019m no Christian, I believe in no Hell but I\u2019d be damned if I didn\u2019t condemn him to it.\n\nI thought I\u2019d feel differently once sentencing was over. \n\nI don\u2019t. \n\nI\u2019ve never been in this position. An innocent so dear to me murdered? How do I forgive that? Will there be a year that I don\u2019t shed tears for her? Will her memory die? Am I doing enough to bring awareness? \n\nI dream of her and our past often. \n\nI\u2019m not okay today. But tomorrow is another day to heal. \n\nThank you for listening..\n\n\n\n\n", "subreddit": "GriefSupport"}

I\u2019m not even sure if I mean it figuratively either. I just know that as I struggled to get my nails painted it dawned on me that my fingers and hands and toes and feet are exactly like my moms.\n\nWhen I was little I used to paint my mom\u2019s nails and examine what they looked like. Sometimes I would admire them in awe and sometimes in disgust. . Her hands were dainty and light. Her fingers were long and her little pinky always poked out like a princess drinking from a cup of tea. Her pinky finger was abnormally shorter than the rest of her fingers. Her feet were long, her toes were freakishly long, her big toe pointed inward and she always had a pretty rough callous on the balls of her feet where the big toe meets the foot. Her little pinky toe, like her pinky finger, was so much shorter than the rest of her toes and barely had a nail on it; just enough to put a little dap of polish.\n\nNot too many years ago my dad told me I had my mother\u2019s hands. I think that was the first time I actually looked at them to find the similarities, but tonight it hit me that these are my mother\u2019s hands; these are my mother\u2019s feet.  My hands are dainty like my moms, small compared to my build, my little pinky finger is always sticking out just like my mom\u2019s, just like a princess. They move the same way hers did. They hold things the same way. They are light and dainty just like hers.  My feet are a size smaller then hers, my callous is on the outside of my feet rather than the inside and I still have the nail on my pinky toes (which I\u2019m sure will change with age). But my feet are long like hers, my toes are long like hers, my pinky toe is abnormally smaller than the rest of my toes like hers, my nails are the same shape as hers and they are just as big of a pain in the ass to polish as hers.\n\nWhat do I do with this new found knowledge that I\u2019m walking around with my mother\u2019s hands and feet? Part of me wants to pretend like they are not hers and they are my dad\u2019s. They are from the parent that is still here, still taking care of things, taking care of me. Part of me wants to hide them, to keep them from people so I don\u2019t have to tell people I\u2019m living with my dead mother\u2019s hands and feet. So I don\u2019t have to explain what happened to her and how she died; or how I\u2019m still struggling with her illness and her death. But that is not what my mother would do with her own hands and feet if she were still here and well. She would use her hands to create new things, make quilts, sew, prepare meals, write, explore and teach others. She would use her feet to travel, explore, ride roller coasters, run, and jump, she would let them take her anywhere her heart desired. She would not hide these hands and feet! She would show them off to whoever listened and tell stories about their magic healing powers and why all those scars on them are so important.\n\nShe\u2019s gone but her hands and feet remain with me, a gift she gave me at birth, a gift I did not realize I was given until tonight. I will be proud of these hands for what they create because these are my mother\u2019s hands too. I will be proud of these feet and wherever they take me because they are my mother\u2019s feet too. I will not hide them, I will not be angry that I have them; I will use them as she would.  \n\nTo live! To be happy! To explore! To teach! To learn!\n \n ", "subreddit": "GriefSupport"}

He and my mama (grandmother) raised my brother and I since I was 16 months old. He is my father in every way that counts and every day without him cuts deeply. \n\nI\u2019ve been incredibly stressed lately. I had to take a full week off from work when I was home with him as he passed and I have no PTO so it was a hard hit. I will do it again next weekend to go home for his services. I\u2019m also applying to a graduate program to get my masters in education and a teaching credential and I\u2019m working 12+ hour shifts up to 6 days a week. I\u2019m tired, I\u2019m a mess, and I still feel very broken. \n\nYesterday I was on my way home from work early in the morning when it was still dark. A car with its lights off swerved into my lane, sideswiped me, and sped away. My insurance won\u2019t cover the deductible because I can\u2019t prove that the hit and run driver wasn\u2019t insured and I can\u2019t afford to fix my car so now I have no idea how I\u2019ll make the 450 mile drive home for the funeral. I got home, collapsed in a sobbing heap next to my sleeping partner and fell asleep. \n\nI had a dream. My partner wanted to take me camping but we don\u2019t have a camp stove. I have one in my grandparents garage because granddad, my brother, and I used to camp all the time. We showed up at the house and both of my grandparents were there. (My grandmother passed away almost exactly 3 years ago). We visited for awhile and I asked to search the garage for the camp stove. I found it immediately, but found myself drawn to other objects in the garage. For context, my grandmother was a pack rat and hasn\u2019t thrown anything away since she moved to that house in 1969. After she died my aunts cleared out and organized the garage, but the garage in my dream was definitely the one I grew up in, not the one filled with neatly packed Tupperware bins. \n\nI found my old record player that had been my mother\u2019s and paused to play a record. Granddad came out and sang along. \u201cYou are my sunshine,\u201d the song he used to sing to me all the time. \n\nI found my secondhand vintage pink fixie bike with the flowered white vinyl banana seat and streamers that he\u2019d bought me for my 9th birthday. We were poor but he wanted me to have something of my own that wasn\u2019t a hand me down from my brother. In my dream we talked about the day he gave it to me and the day I had ridden it 10 miles down a 2 lane highway with him to go get my brother from Boy Scout camp. \n\nI found the bird cage he built for my pet quail that I\u2019d raised from an egg at school and then adopted without asking him first because no one wanted this one. It had been attacked by the others and had no feathers on the top of his head. Grandad didn\u2019t get mad, just went to the hardware store and bought what he needed to make him a secure cage in a neighborhood full of cats. He grew up on a farm and knew a lot about animal care. In my dream he hugged me and laughed about the day Chico Flew away because my friend was afraid of birds and screamed when I was getting him out of his cage to clean it. \n\nMemory after memory flooded back and the driveway in my dream was cluttered with them. Granddad sitting next to me and helping me sort them all out. Finally it started getting dark and we started putting things back. Granddad told me that he loved me and that he hoped partner and I had fun on our adventure, but it was time for him to go back inside. Mama was waiting for him and dinner was on the table. I gave him a hug and he said what he always said when I left \u201cI love you baby, you\u2019re my everything. Call your grandmother when you get where you\u2019re going.\u201d Then he watched until we drove away. \n\nI woke up crying. I don\u2019t know why this dream came now but it made me realize just how fortunate I am to have had him as a father. Things are still a mess. I\u2019m still stressed out. I\u2019m still a mess. But I feel a little less broken now. So yesterday when I woke up I let my fianc\u00e9 take care of me. I finished my grad school application. I called the lien holder on my car loan to get an extension on my car payment to help ease the financial burden a little. I reached out to a friend and she let me cry it out on the phone for almost an hour. I put one foot in front of another and made it through another day. Thank you granddad.

Im 32 years old and the youngest of 6 children in 2013 my father passed away and my whole life changed forever.  I will give you a little background as a child I was very fortunate to live with both of my biological parents. I did have step brothers and sister's but never seen them as step. My parents were loving and supportive. My mother was my best friend and although my father was strict he was my hero. Whenever anything went wrong in life he would be there and my mother would with her kind word's and understanding. In around 2008 I met a guy and ended up having a child with him in February 2010 after he was born i ended up becoming addicted to heroin which was short lived yet my parents were there for me and raised my child while i went to rehab and got my life together needless to say i have been clean off heroin since sep.11.2010 i graduated the drug court program and rehab and I now have 3 children.( my point I had such great parents) .... Anyway in Dec.21 2013 my father passed away I can remember ever detail me screaming for him to wake up running around not knowing what to do until the paramedics arrived any then going to the hospital and them saying that he was gone. At that moment I knew my life would change forever I wont keep rambling to long needless to say my mother lost the beautiful home they owned because she got addicted to methamphetamine and is now with a physically abusive man who just beats her ass he goes to jail she bails him out, my sisters are both on meth, my uncle, everyone. I am now estranged from all of my family I live 2 hours away now and choose not to allow they're chaos to become mine because I love my children so much and cant jeopardize my sobriety or sanity. I miss my father so much, and when I see moms and daughters together my age I break down.( I stopped talking to my mother when she allowed her boyfriend to call my 7 year old son a coward and was doing drugs while my son was with her and the icing on the cake was when she decided to get mad at me and told me she hated me because I wouldn't get her drugs) anyway I dont know why people say it gets easier because for me it never has. I wish I just had someoe to talk to besides my kids but I feel like im such damaged goods anyone would run for the hills if I asked them to be my friend. I have been through alot and so have my children I was physically abused by my first sons father and when he was a baby his father bit him in his face and gave him a bloody nose while i was at work, my father became not only my hero but my sons as well. My son is now 9 and has never seen his real father because hes always in prison and I have to protect my child. I just dont understand how my mother could just not love me anymore in Oct.2017 I had my last child I was all alone nobody even called or stopped by to see him because they were high or in jail. I felt so alone i can remember calling my mom from the hospital phone crying saying please come see him on her voicemail because she never answers i held out hope she would show up. I was on my own after having a c-section. Does the sadness ever stop? Any advice?", "subreddit": "GriefSupport"}

Not forgetting, just healing. It's felt good to get back into a routine. I went back to work two weeks after Dad passed -- it was really soon, but I've had a flexible working arrangement with my employer since then that has made everything easier. I'm still not fully recovered mentally/emotionally. I'm still dealing with frequent insomnia, moments of weakness, and lapses in memory/thought (\"grief brain\" I guess).

He's skipping class now, and apparently he's now insistent on moving out at 18 and getting a job somewhere (instead of going to trade school like he talked about before Dad died). I know teenagers can be fickle, but he's graduating high school in 3 months and has no plans whatsoever. Yesterday, he told my mom and me that he was starting his own photography business after graduation because \"he takes better pictures than the newspaper does\", but said he wasn't interested in school because he's \"not motivated enough to go to class right now\" and he's never taken any training in photography. A week ago, he said he wanted to start a video game marketing business, and he'd just network his way into getting business? I know this works for a few people here and there, and I wouldn't care as much if he had a financial safety net, but my mom is basically living off life insurance money right now and she can't afford to fund his life if he moves out. He has also said some hurtful things to her (calling her an idiot/dumb because she doesn't have a job right now, which is so bad in so many ways).

I find this day worse than the actual day, it's the build up I guess. But I miss him so much! I still find it odd he's not here. I'm 30, I was 29 when I lost him, he was 50, and I still want to tell him things. Does this stop? I got my hair cut in a style I've never had before (nothing drastic, but I got a fringe and it's shorter than ever before) and I really wanted to send him a picture which I always used to do. And I wonder whether he would have liked it. I think he would. It would be lovely to hear it though. \n\nI was 3 months pregnant at the time, his first grandchild. I hate he's not here to enjoy her, I hate she's not able to enjoy him. He'd have absolutely adored her! I cannot express how much he would have adored her. \n\nHe was such a powerful man. He was tall, dark haired, blue eyed and people just flocked to him. When people say \"men want to be him and women want to be with him\", that was him. Everyone wanted to be his friend - or more. It was actually embarrassing seeing some of the strongest willed women become putty. These women would become giggly school girls and twirl their hair and it was so funny to watch. And of course he lapped it up! He just made everyone feel wanted and important. I'm not sure how he did it. Past boyfriends have told me they wish he was their dad (weird for me!) \n\nDon't get me wrong, he was not perfect. He was an absolute arsehole in fact during his and mum's divorce. I hated him as a teen. And I regret that now. He was my dad after all. I hate that I hated him. \n\nI firmly believe in the after life and the spirit world but being told he's watching over me, he's with me in spirit does not help. I don't want spirit. I want him himself. I was such a daddy's girl and even as an adult, he made me feel like a little girl. One of my last memories is him giving me a hug and I didn't feel like a little girl, I felt like I was going to break him. I so badly want a hug though. I want to feel like he's going to break my ribs again the way he used to.\n\nI'm not sure on the purpose of this post. I just really miss him. I've never felt pain like it. I've never felt angry, I've never once thought \"of all the bad people in the world... blah blah blah\", I know that's not how it works but I do think \"how bloody unfair\". How unfair on me, how unfair on my stepmum, my brother, my kid. I do think why me? I know I'll be ok though, I always am.\n\nSorry for the length and if you got this far, thank you for the taking the time to read. I just needed to vent. Thank you ", "subreddit": "GriefSupport"}

I'm not sure if it's been posted here before or not, but if it has, i'm sure there are people who haven't seen it yet. And maybe it will help them. I know it helps me sometimes....\n\nAlright, here goes. I'm old. What that means is that I've survived (so far) and a lot of people I've known and loved did not. I've lost friends, best friends, acquaintances, co-workers, grandparents, mom, relatives, teachers, mentors, students, neighbors, and a host of other folks. I have no children, and I can't imagine the pain it must be to lose a child. But here's my two cents.\nI wish I could say you get used to people dying. I never did. I don't want to. It tears a hole through me whenever somebody I love dies, no matter the circumstances. But I don't want it to \"not matter\". I don't want it to be something that just passes. My scars are a testament to the love and the relationship that I had for and with that person. And if the scar is deep, so was the love. So be it. Scars are a testament to life. Scars are a testament that I can love deeply and live deeply and be cut, or even gouged, and that I can heal and continue to live and continue to love. And the scar tissue is stronger than the original flesh ever was. Scars are a testament to life. Scars are only ugly to people who can't see.\nAs for grief, you'll find it comes in waves. When the ship is first wrecked, you're drowning, with wreckage all around you. Everything floating around you reminds you of the beauty and the magnificence of the ship that was, and is no more. And all you can do is float. You find some piece of the wreckage and you hang on for a while. Maybe it's some physical thing. Maybe it's a happy memory or a photograph. Maybe it's a person who is also floating. For a while, all you can do is float. Stay alive.\nIn the beginning, the waves are 100 feet tall and crash over you without mercy. They come 10 seconds apart and don't even give you time to catch your breath. All you can do is hang on and float. After a while, maybe weeks, maybe months, you'll find the waves are still 100 feet tall, but they come further apart. When they come, they still crash all over you and wipe you out. But in between, you can breathe, you can function. You never know what's going to trigger the grief. It might be a song, a picture, a street intersection, the smell of a cup of coffee. It can be just about anything...and the wave comes crashing. But in between waves, there is life.\nSomewhere down the line, and it's different for everybody, you find that the waves are only 80 feet tall. Or 50 feet tall. And while they still come, they come further apart. You can see them coming. An anniversary, a birthday, or Christmas, or landing at O'Hare. You can see it coming, for the most part, and prepare yourself. And when it washes over you, you know that somehow you will, again, come out the other side. Soaking wet, sputtering, still hanging on to some tiny piece of the wreckage, but you'll come out.\nTake it from an old guy. The waves never stop coming, and somehow you don't really want them to. But you learn that you'll survive them. And other waves will come. And you'll survive them too. If you're lucky, you'll have lots of scars from lots of loves. And lots of shipwrecks.\n\n", "subreddit": "GriefSupport"}

I know I had one but I struggle to remember the happy memories- I think my happiest memory is singing along to songs in the car as he would take me back to my mum. \n\nMy dad was an alcoholic, and had an extremely addictive personality- coke, gambling, shopping. After 11 years of no improvement, my Mum took us away from him. \n\nDue to my dads addictions, he was never very nice to me- my younger brother didn\u2019t suffer any abuse, it was always me. He stubbed out a cigarette on me a few times when he was drunk, he convinced me that I was the reason my grandmother died, and had tried to punch me a few times, amongst other things. I hated him throughout my teen years and would often not want to see him (we would see him through a contact centre which would make sure he was sober, this was after the abuse started happening). \n\nIt was Christmas time, I was 18, and he was coming to visit us with my Grandad driving him, as he had lost his license- he had turned up drunk after downing a small bottle of vodka in a services station that my grandad didn\u2019t see. \nMy mum had remarried (which was difficult for my dad) and I had a new half sister. He drunkenly stepped on one of her new toys and I got angry (anything he did at this stage when drunk would make me angry). My mum sent him on his way and I didn\u2019t say goodbye to him. \n\nHis birthday came around in February, and I didn\u2019t call him or text him to wish him happy birthday. 3 weeks later he passed away due to only drinking alcohol and not eating enough food. \n\nI can\u2019t help but think, if I\u2019d called him, would he still be here? Most probably. The guilt is wrecking me. I didn\u2019t understand him and why he was acting the way he was, because I was an angry teenager but I have since found out circumstances that made him start drinking in the first place and feel like I understand him more now and wish I had tried to help him when he was alive rather than judging him.\n\nI had a dream the other day, where he was sober and I saw him at a train station and his death had been faked, he smiled at me and I ran towards him and he picked me up, and I actually felt him pick me up in my sleep. It felt so real and I was so happy when I woke up to then seconds later being a crumbling mess.\n\nSorry that this is all a rambling, but does anyone have any advice for dealing with guilt? I\u2019ve tried to speak to a counsellor or therapist but the waiting list is so long and feel like I\u2019m not getting anywhere.\n\nTLDR: didn\u2019t call alcoholic father on his birthday, he then drank himself to death 3 weeks later.

We have two cats, but my husband has wanted a dog since I met him. We've lived in apartments and townhouses til recently and never wanted to shut in the kind of large breed we wanted. But now we've bought a house with a large backyard and a privacy fence, our daughter is old enough to start to help out, and we thought it was the perfect time. So we adopted a puppy from a local rescue. She was adorable and sweet, and our daughter loved her right away.\n\nAfter she'd been with us a week, my husband came home from the store and found her dead in her kennel. The vet said that she had aspirated some of her food, tried to cough it back up, and choked to death. My husband was only out of the house for about 20 minutes. We were devastated. We told our daughter the truth, that the puppy got sick very quickly and there was nothing we could do, and she took it hard, but we felt it was important not to lie to her. That was back in December.\n\nA month or so ago, we decided we were ready, and started looking again. Two weeks ago, we found a wonderful puppy that our daughter helped us choose, and we brought her home. On Wednesday, my husband came home and found her dead in her kennel. Apparently she had torn off a piece of one of her toys somehow, or it might have been part of her mat she'd chewed off, but she choked. I don't know how she managed to get anything small enough to choke on off of her extra-durable toys, but she did. \n\nThis time, we lied to our daughter. She'd been so afraid after what happened the first time, so worried that something was going to happen to the puppy, that I just couldn't bear the thought of confirming those fears. We told her that since we got the puppy from a shelter, we didn't know that she'd actually been lost, and her previous owners had come asking about her, so we had to give her back to her first family. I didn't want to lie, but I also don't want my daughter to think that every dog just dies. She took it better, but said that she really had hoped this one would be \"a forever puppy.\"\n\nI keep telling myself that these were both horrible accidents, and there isn't really anything we could have done, but I can't help feeling like the worst, most neglectful person. I feel sad for my husband, who wanted a companion so badly, and for my daughter, who is a gentle, loving kid who would have been either dog's best friend for life. But I also feel angry, and bitter, because so many people get puppies and just toss them in the backyard, and they're fine, while my husband spent hours reading up on training techniques and learning about breeds and spending every waking moment trying to make sure the dog was safe and happy. He had already signed up to take her to a puppy training class.\n\nI just don't know if either of us will ever be able to get a puppy again without feeling terrified. I already spent every day since we got the second pup worried that every time my husband called me during the day, it would be to tell me again that the dog was dead. And that came true.

I got a call from Australia on a Sunday morning out of no where and was given the news that my brother had got some blood infection and that he was put on a life support machine, I needed to advise my parents that we had an issue and i was asked by my Mother and Father to head over him immediately and be by his side. I called the Airline and got a flight a few hours later. I arrived In Australia after 24 hours of flying and was briefed by doctors, and was advised my brothers machine needed to be switched off.\n\nI was deeply low but not beaten and I believe this was because I needed to be there for his kids and his wife, my Mother and my Father by trying to be strong for everyone. So I basically put on a persona and pretended I was ok but deep down I was broken from losing my brother but I dont believe I showed it.\n\nI came home from Australia after what I think was about a 10 day round trip with just haze in my head of WTF just happened.\n\nI was trying to grieve for my brother but its like because I was used to him not being there I was struggling to grieve and I would only truly feel sorrow if I had a few beers. I was used to him not being at home as he had lived in Australia for a number of years now, so the grieving was just a hollow feeling and one that was there but not an emotional roller coaster of tears or how I thought I should feel.\n\nWhen I got home, I spent time making sure my kids where ok and my brothers kids where ok in Australia(the best I could) and making sure my Mother was ok.\n\nMy Mother was really upset and could confide in me as she has always done through my life. My mother smoked for years but had quit smoking about 8 years ago but suffered from COPD and this was the reason she couldn't fly to Australia to with her son.\n\nApprox 5 weeks after my brother had died she got an infection, seemed to be like a cold/flu which wasnt unusual for my mother but I hadn't seen her sick in about 1 year. It quickly escualted to hospital and then to intensive care and then unfortunately she passed away.\n\nWithin 5/6 weeks i had lost 2 pillars of my life and I dont say that lightly. I'm a quite person with not many friends and keep my business to my self. The only 2 people on this planet that I felt I could genuinely tell them anything and for it to be accepted had just been taken away from me.

I could be driving down the road and just burst into fits of tears...I'm a grown man!! Pull it together I'd say.\n\nI believe that everyone's grieve is different, emotions come at different times for different people. Peoples worries are different, some peoples security has just been taken completely away from them, there best friend, sole mate...\n\nWhat I would say from my learnings is that this will never leave me, I've been through a shit time and I'm now at a point that things are starting to feeling normal again and tears are not as frequent, the lack of sleep is pretty much gone the repetitive conversations in my mind of the events that unfolded are not nearly as frequent. I never seen these things coming at me. \n\nDont be afraid to grieve as you cant force it...I've tried.\n\nDont feel guilty for not grieving...I've tried.\n\nTry greaving counselling..I've tried and I think it might have helped.\n\nUnderstand that this will subside and this doesnt mean you do not care anymore.\n\nUnderstand this takes time to feel better and the better days will come.\n\nMost of all this is shit!  but remember the good times you have had with your loved ones.\n\nBe nice to people around you as they will be grieving as well but be at a completly different stage to you on there own journey of grief.\n\nSorry for typos and grammer, I'm on a smart phone and have never typed as much!", "subreddit": "GriefSupport"}

When I was six years old he suffered a massive stroke (he lived alone) which left him mentally and verbally impaired. After that he lived with my family until his passing. I was 16 when he died. I'm 17 now, about to turn 18 in May, and finishing my senior year in high school. \n\nMy grandfather had difficulty speaking and would have trouble with his mental processes. Every day he followed the same schedule - he ate the same thing, got up at the same time, and did everything the same. My family got used to this schedule. Sometimes it was really hard to understand him, and he would never listen to my mom and I when we told him not to do something (I have a memory of him trying to take out the garbage in a thunderstorm because that's the time he always did it), so we started to avoid him. We let my dad, who is his son, take care of him most of the time because it was easier that way. Occasionally I felt guilty about it, but it never bothered me too much because it was the way we had always lived. \n\nThe day he died, school released for Thanksgiving break. Usually my little sister and I walk home together, but she had been having trouble at school and got picked up early. So it was just me that day. \n\nMy grandfather loved woodworking and we had a little shed off the garage that he would work in most days. I noticed that he was there, but he was slumped over and had his hat covering his eyes. I got this feeling in my chest that something was wrong - I kept trying to convince myself that I was just overreacting because he slept outside all the time. My grandma, who also lives with us, (and isn't related to my grandfather), was the only adult who was home. My dad was away at the school talking to administrators about my little sister and my mom was at work. I got her and asked her to look at him for me. She went outside and called his name a few times.\n\nShe looked back at me with this horrified, blank expression, her hand resting on his leg, and told me to call 911. I see it over and over no matter how much I try to forget it. I panicked, begging her to do it, not knowing what to say to them. My grandma called 911 so it was my job to call my parents.\n\nI called my mom first. I remember the sound of her voice, but I don't remember what we said to each other. Everything started to turn fuzzy around that point. Calling my dad was one of the hardest moments. \n\nAfter I finished calling my parents, I hovered around like a gnat and listened to the muffled sound of my grandma on the phone with 911. A single police officer showed up first, and I know that he laid my grandfather down on the ground and started to do CPR on him. I heard the ambulance sirens a little while later, and there were about five paramedics that flocked into that garage to help him. The police officer who had gotten there originally was joined by his partner, and the two of them came to question me. They asked me what I had seen, what had happened. The strangest part about it was that I tried to cry when they talked to me. I felt like I had to cry if I wanted them to believe me, but I couldn't. I felt like I was underwater. I remember having to give them my school ID and that they moved on to talk to my grandmother a little while afterwards. \n\nI had been inside until my mom came home. She rushed over to the driveway and sobbed. That's one of the biggest images that I keep seeing - my mom crying. My dad came home a little while afterwards and ran towards the garage. The officers had to hold him back while the paramedics worked. \n\nI don't know how much time passed before one of the paramedics came into our kitchen, where we were all standing, and told us that he had been gone when I found him. The rest of the day was fragmented into pieces that I can hardly recall. The last thing I can remember from that day was walking over to my dad and seeing my grandfather's feet sticking out from the tarp they had covered me in.\n\nMy dad dropped him off from lunch about 20 minutes before I had gotten home. He had died somewhere in between that time and when I had found him. It could have been a minute before. I could have been looking at him right as his heart stopped. There was no autopsy, but his doctor believes he had another stroke or a heart attack. \n\nI'm sorry that this whole sequence of events is so fragmented, but that's all I can remember of it. Also, I'm sorry that this post is so long. But I hope someone can help me. \n\nAt first, I struggled a lot with guilt. If I had walked home faster, if I had done CPR, if I had called 911 the second I saw him, then maybe I could have saved him. I've been told dozens of times that it's not the case. If anything, he would have been forced to live in a home if I could have saved him, and I've been assured that he didn't want that. The second wave of guilt came in the form of my parents. I felt responsible for telling them that he had died. I felt like, in some twisted way, that I had caused their grief. \n\nIt's been a little over a year since then. I feel like some days I'm so irritable that I can hardly stand to be around anyone. Other days, I cling to people so desperately that I can't be without someone. I've had a problem with dissociating since then as well, which I went to my therapist once for. I haven't seen her since that one meeting we had after he died. I keep seeing all of it over and over. I tried my best to forget about it and push it down after he died, but it's like it's seeping into my life. Even when I'm doing something as simple as taking a shower, I'll see those images. I see my mother crying, my grandfather under that tarp, his body hunched over and his face obscured. Some days are so bad that I feel like I'm underwater. Half of the time I'm just running on autopilot. \n\nMy little sister has also struggled with suicidal thoughts and depression, and I have this overwhelming fear that I'm going to find her dead. I'm terrified that I'm going to try to wake my parents up and they're not going to. \n\nSince then my life hasn't gotten terrible necessarily, but it's become like a dream. I feel numbed and cloudy, but at the same time everything hurts like it's magnified. It's hard to explain. My head always feels weird, like I can't think as far as I used to. I've started drinking recklessly alone, not really caring much if I don't wake up.\n\nRecently I've been having a hard time with school and relationships. I've considered suicide but have no plans of doing it. I do feel like if I died accidentally, like an overdose or getting hit by a car, that it wouldn't be that bad. I've isolated myself from friends and family in the past week, trying to figure out what is wrong with me. Most of the time I've just been sleeping (about from when I get home at 3:00 to around 10:00, then I eat dinner and go back to sleep). I know I'm depressed. I've struggled with it before in middle school. But it feels like there's another layer to this. I feel like I can't talk to my friends or parents because I don't want to bother them \n\nI don't know what's wrong with me. \n\nHas anyone ever had anything like this happen to them before? How do I deal with this? How do I stop seeing these things so much? I feel like it's eating me alive. ", "subreddit": "GriefSupport"}

My current contract is up in a couple of months and then that's it. I have no teaching credential, but I have a master's degree in the subject I teach.

My admin explained to me that since my department head is leaving, they will need someone with a credential in my position.\n\nI'm absolutely crushed. I seriously thought that this was the last job I'd ever have. I really wanted to be a part of this community because I love all the people so much. Just felt really depressed ever since.

I moved back in with her about a year and a half before she died. She needed help, and I needed help, I was and still am having trouble on the job front. My brother is executor of her will, he's off in Oregon though and I'm on the east coast. Both he and some family were here when she got sick, they all had to leave a few days before she died, so it was just me and my friend in hospice when she stopped breathing.\n\nSince then I've felt stuck in this house. I had been looking to move for a long time but toward the end couldn't leave her, and she wouldn't move. Now the house is sold, and I'm just cleaning everything out on my own before closing. Due to moving back here most of my friends are at least 50 to 60 miles away, an easy hour or two drive with traffic around here, so I'm basically alone now. All the time. I freak out at night, I worry about money during the day. I haven't been eating right by a country mile.\n\nWe still don't know why she got sick, her back was too messed up to get a lumbar puncture, she wouldn't hold still long enough for a CAT scan, even with max doses of Fentanyl and another anesthetic she was moving and thrashing. She was occasionally lucid, I got to tell her I loved her one more time and got to hear it in return. But her fever never broke and they couldn't figure out what it was, and even after several courses of antibiotics and antivirals there was no response.\n\nThe night before she died I called my friend and tried to talk to her, I'm not sure how coherent I was but she came out the next day and was with me when my mom stopped breathing.\n\nI have no idea where this was going, I've been lurking here for a while now and reading posts, I guess I felt guilty getting some empathy from realizing I'm not alone and not letting anyone know they weren't alone.\n\nWhen this house is gone I'll be driving across the country, I'm going to mail what stuff I've decided to keep to my brother and then head down the coast to see my cousins, my aunt and uncle, maybe an ex girlfriend or two. I think I'll be okay but it still freaks me the hell out that the home I grew up in really isn't mine anymore. I'm just stewarding it until the next owner shows up.\n\nMy mother had left a few valiums and ambiens and I used them when I had trouble sleeping, which has been most nights.

She had a high risk of premature birth, stillbirth, death in infancy. If she survived birth she would require an operation at birth. Several operations in her first year and most likely a heart transplant once old enough. If she did survive all this she would have a short life expectancy. And would most likely know only a life of operations, hospitals and suffering. We felt our only option was to end the pregnancy and labour was induced that week. She was born at 18 weeks 2 days gestation and was tiny and beautiful. \nThe following day my 3 year old niece, who had a complex neurological condition, was moved to a hospice for end of life care. She passed away the following week, 6 days after the birth/death of my daughter. \n\nI want to be there for my sister, understandably she doesn\u2019t want to talk much. And getting hold of her is difficult. I currently don\u2019t work due to suffering fibromyalgia and looking after my 2 year old. I can\u2019t drive at the moment as my anxiety is so bad and I\u2019ve had panic attacks each time I\u2019ve tried to drive in the last couple of weeks. \nMy sister and her partner have been looked after well by the hospice. Our aunt has been to visit to help them with their puppy and their 10 year old and 1.5 year old sons. And my sisters in-laws have also been helping with the sons. My mum has been talking to my sister every day and visiting her, bringing her things she needs. \nWe have been to visit my sister most days for a couple of hours, but respect that some days she just doesn\u2019t want company. \n\nI know people are helping her out. But I\u2019m worried she may be angry at me for not being able to support her and help her out. \n\nYesterday I saw my mum and stepdad and I mentioned that my sister had asked me to inform our stepbrother on the date for the funeral. My stepdad said he could tell him. But when I got home I thought maybe I should stick to doing it as my sister had asked me. And if my stepbrother knew sooner he might be more likely to be able to attend. \n\nI was under the impression that my stepbrother knew about our niece passing away and sent him a text message. He told me that he wasn\u2019t aware that she had passed away and is flying somewhere on the day of the funeral and will see if he is able to change the flight. \n\nI messaged my mum later and let her know and she said my stepbrother has spoken to my stepdad. I\u2019m worried my mum is angry at me for this as maybe I was out of line contacting him?\n\nI feel like I can\u2019t function properly. I can\u2019t be bothered to look after myself and I can\u2019t really eat properly. I\u2019m only getting out of bed and getting on with looking after my daughter. Because I have to do that. I feel like I\u2019m upsetting everyone but I can\u2019t tell people this as it feels incredibly selfish to be worried about things like this when we\u2019re all grieving. \nI can\u2019t think properly about my baby as my sister and brother in law have lost their 3 year old, who spent a lot of her life suffering with her disability. She was being admitted to hospital on a regular basis with life threatening seizures, alongside her complex medical needs. \nI feel selfish being sad about losing my baby girl. As we chose to end the pregnancy. A part of me wishes we hadn\u2019t, I know we did the right thing and we didn\u2019t really have any other option. As bringing her into the world knowing she would suffer isn\u2019t fair. \n\nI keep forgetting I\u2019m not pregnant anymore, I\u2019ve been having phantom movements. And I keep thinking about plans I need to make before the due date. \n\nI miss my niece so much, she was the most incredible,  happy and brave little girl. It\u2019s so unfair that her short life has ended, and it\u2019s so unfair that she couldn\u2019t have the long, healthy, happy life she deserved. \n", "subreddit": "GriefSupport"}

It feels like everyone is dying all around me, and it is just too much. In the past 6 years, I have lost my grandma, my mother, my best friend, my mom's best friend, one of my favorite coworkers, and my great aunt. Some of these losses have affected me more than others, but it feels like just when I am making peace with one death, I am hit with another. Losing my mom was the hardest of course, but losing my best friend last year made everything so much worse, because she was the one I would talk to when I was feeling down. I just went to my coworker's funeral yesterday. She was diagnosed with stage 4 cancer only 2 weeks ago, and already she is gone. The busy time of the year is coming at work, and I am dreading going back and working without her. It is going to be so lonely and quiet working alone when we always worked as a team. My grandma and great aunt's deaths have affected me, but they lived long full lives, and so their deaths were a lot easier for me to make peace with. My great aunt (who'd funeral I will be attending later this week) had a very unusual nick name, and when I asked how she got it, we realized that she was the last one of that generation,  and no one still living knows how she got that nickname, though we have a few good guesses. Anyway, this is getting long and even if no one reads it, just writing it out has been cathartic for me. And even though my whole post has been really depressing, for anyone reading this that has lost someone they care about, know that life does go on. It does get better.

At approximately 9AM his coworker called and told  me that he never showed up at work.  My coworker started calling all the  police stations and hospitals.  An hour later the troopers walked into  my office to tell me that my husband was dead. Just like that my life as  I knew it was over and I suddenly became a single parent of 4 children.\n\nMy  husband was perfect for me.  I truly believe that he was my soulmate.   Our relationship was like a fairy tale.  I got to marry my first and  only boyfriend.  Then about a year ago, things began to go downhill.  He  changed.  He yelled a lot at me and the kids and developed some health  problems.  I honestly thought he was just having a mid-life crisis  because he had just turned 40.  And diabetes runs in his family so I  really didn't think anything of that either.\n\nI  don't really know what caused him to crash the car that day; there was  no autopsy. But I believe that he died of a heart attack while driving  and that's what caused him to crash.  It turns out that he had an eating  addiction that I didn't know about, at least not consciously.  I found  credit card statements after he died that included hundreds of dollars  spent on fast food.  He was eating at different fast food places every  day and I had no idea.\n\nNow I am left  here with all of these feelings.  I blame myself for not seeing what was  going on or trying to do more to change it.  I am angry because I feel  like the kids and I weren't enough for him.  The love we had for him was  not enough to change his behavior.  I am also angry because I didn't  sign up to be a single mother with 4 kids and it's tough especially when  you add in the widow part.  I just wish I had 5 minutes to talk to him  to find out what was really going on.  I hate myself for letting  everything get so bad.  We were closer than any two people could be.  I  should have seen it.  I should have done more to try to stop his  destructive behavior.  I wanted forever with him.\n\nI  loved being married and I loved taking care of someone in that way, so  it didn't surprise me at all that I felt ready to put my online dating  profile up around Thanksgiving.  Honestly I wasn't thinking anything  would come of it.  Let's be honest, I didn't have guys knocking down my  door to date me in the past.  I have a mild disability and now I could  tack on crazy widow with 4 kids.\n\nI  think my profile was only up for a little over a week when this guy  messaged me.  He asked me what my favorite historical period was and  being a big nerd (and a history major) I was pretty much hooked.  I very  much enjoyed our online conversation.  When it came time to meet in  person I was pretty nervous because I had very little dating experience.  (I didn't even really date my husband because I knew that we were going  to get married on our first date.) The date was just a continuation of  our online conversation.  Over the next few weeks I revealed my  disability, the widow thing, and the 4 kids and he didn't run away  screaming.  Most days I still don't know why.\n\nWe  have been dating for over 3 months and things are going very well.  He  told me after only a couple weeks that he could see forever with me and I  see it too.  We love each other and I am incredibly happy.  He brought  my smile and laugh back and gave me what I needed to have fun with my  children again.  I am so lucky - he is doing the \"dating a widow thing\"  so well.  I can be open and honest about my husband.  He knows that my  wedding rings are on my right hand and that I will probably never take  them off.  He knows that I will always be in love with my husband.  He  knows that there is room in my heart for both of them.\n\nThis  is not an easy journey.  Because there have only been two men in my  life, it's been hard not to compare the two.  I think as human beings we  are wired to make comparisons.  I have desperately been trying not to  do that.  I feel a lot of guilt especially when it comes to sex.  I know  it probably sounds stupid to most people but growing up I only wanted  to have sex with one person - the person I married.  I was lucky enough  to have that and it was amazing.  We had an amazing connection in that  way.  Losing him meant that I was going to have to break my rule of  having sex with someone else, because let's face it, I knew enough about  myself to know there was no way I could go without it.  That's where  most of the guilt comes into play.  I am now developing that strong  sexual connection with someone else and that goes against everything I  told myself for so many years.  I didn't believe in sex before marriage  and sex after marriage was and still is a difficult thing for me to get  used to.  Not that I would change a thing though - this new relationship  has introduced me to some experiences and feelings that I didn't have  with my husband.  And of course, there is a little guilt about that too.\n\nWhy  am I writing this post?  Because I woke up this morning and can't seem  to stop crying.  The closer it gets to the one-year anniversary, the  more sad I feel.  I miss my husband and part of me wants my old life  back.  I want my children to have their father back.  But in doing that I  would have to erase my chapter 2 and I can't do that either.  Honestly,  missing my husband makes me feel like I am cheating on my boyfriend in a  weird way.  What I have learned over the past year is that you never  know which day will be your last.  Love is so important.  It's important  to treat people right and to love as much as you can.  Even though it  sucks, I totally believe that I was meant to be a widow with 4 kids and  that I was meant to meet my new boyfriend and fall in love again.  My  new love is amazing and wonderful and deserves to be loved. I only hope  he understands that I can miss my late husband and love my new  relationship with him at the same time.

Last year it was a decade without her, the 10 year anniversary and I spent it watching Sea Biscuit and The Sound of Music crying like I do. It was a quiet day. I had a professor in college that always told us not to put W.U.S (wild unfounded speculation) into our papers, don\u2019t put in arguments you cannot firmly back up with text from the book.  I like to apply that tactic to my life, but sometimes I can\u2019t help but think about how different my life would be if she was alive. At this point it\u2019s been so long that I go from dreaming about an ideal world with her still in it to realizing my parents would have probably gotten a divorce and it wouldn\u2019t be some cushy life like I dream. I\u2019m 25 now, so the older I get the easier it gets (besides the fact that I\u2019m getting married without her this summer, hard, but not the point of this post).\nLike I said, 11 years is coming up very quickly. This year I didn\u2019t see it coming, I only realized it when my co-workers started talking about April Fools day. This year will be an easier year. I don\u2019t have that \u201cjust moved dread\u201d like when I moved away to attend college, or the \u201cdecade dread\u201d of how did I make it this far without my mom. Everyone feels grief differently, so I am not saying year 11 for y\u2019all will be roses, but I am saying there will be easier times. I did a lot of Grief Group sitting in high school (shout out to G^2) that I thought was supposed to show me how to heal, but it really pushed me to stop reminiscing on her death and blaming how sad I was on her and take my growth into my own hands. It was the best thing that could have happened for me, because I looked her death and my feelings in the face so much I got sick of it. Year 11, I\u2019m proud of me, I am glad for the time I had with my mom, proud of how much emotion I\u2019ve survived. This year is a year to celebrate her life and mine, to be thankful and feel blessed. I hope as time goes on everyone finds these moments of bliss, maybe with tears, with wine and chocolate or a quiet walk.

He called me his baby. I just assumed I would make the time to go visit him again this month but now its too late. And it was always too late because I couldn't take myself off my ass out of my house and make the effort to spend time with him. He was such a deep thinker and a funny guy with the biggest heart and he accepted anyone and was never vain or selfish. I look just like him. I blame myself and I know its not right.

For 16 years the person I reached out to for all things was my best friend, never anyone else, only her. I have trust issues. I have a lot of issues, so did she though and we had an unconditional friendship and love for each other that I've been told countless times is extremely rare. We called each other soulmate best friends. I had my first major panic attack the day she died, she had one too that day and that evening her heart stopped beating. Her mom called me the following morning and I spent 3 days screaming then I had to pull my shit together and fly 2,000 miles to her home town to go to her open casket funeral and burial,  f*** open caskets, I helped lower her into her grave. I'm going to be cremated and thrown in the damn ocean or used to grow a tree. I don't want to rot in a grave and I hate that she is, and its something I can't stop thinking about. She always told me she wanted to be cremated, but her family believed otherwise. \n\nIt's 8 months later, I'm still screaming except now my screams are silent, internal, and with a smile on my face as the world keeps moving forward. \ud83d\ude43", "subreddit": "GriefSupport"}

I was hoping to seek some advice from someone who might have been through something similar.\n\nMy now husband and I bought the house that we currently live in about two years ago, in March 2017.  We got married in May 2017.  My dad was diagnosed with Stage Four Esophageal Cancer exactly eleven days after my wedding.  His prognosis was grim, but he sought treatment anyway.  He moved into our house and lived in the guest room.\n\nHe did about six months of treatment before it was clear that nothing was going to work.  He made the decision to enter hospice and died a little over two weeks later.\n\nI watched him wither away in this house.  He died in this house, in that guest room.  I don't like that room anymore and I don't enter it willingly.  \n\nI inherited everything when he died, including his house.  My husband and I used some of my inheritance to do some much needed updates on our house--a new HVAC system and some sorely needed bathroom repairs.  We have invested a lot of time and money into this stupid house.  This stupid house that I fell madly in love with when we bought it in 2017.\n\nI put his house on the market because it wasn't financially feasible to maintain two mortgages long term and I am closing on the stupid thing in a few weeks.  I am way less than happy about that, but it is what it is.  I am going to make a decent amount of money from the sale of my dad's home.  \n\nI want nothing more than to sell my own house and get the hell away from these memories, but I also know that I need to be realistic.  I can't just leave, even though I WANT to.  \n\nSo I guess my question is how I might be able to change some stuff in the guest bedroom to make it more tolerable?  Could changing it completely trick my brain?  Maybe new paint?  Rearranging the furniture? \n\nAlso, please don't tell me to go to therapy.  I have been.  I'm looking for actual concrete ideas for that stupid room.", "subreddit": "GriefSupport"}

You have been gone so long now that the feel of your skin has long since faded from my memory.  Your face has become blurry, like the rest of my eyesight, as I age without control or consent.  I can\u2019t quite remember your laugh any more, my ears have gone too.  I never had a chance to tell you but I joined the Marines!  I know, it really wasn\u2019t a smart move.  I wish you had been there to talk me out of it, but then again if you had been there I never would have joined.  It is impossible to live without your heart and being so far from you, I might have died from heartache alone. I missed you so much, I had to run away for a while. I missed your dad\u2019s funeral, I spoke to L and she told me that he was gone.  This was a few months after he lost his battle, I was drunk and a tramp riding freight to nowhere, not the man you had loved.  I hope you didn\u2019t see me then, I prayed you couldn\u2019t.  I joined the Marines to get myself out of the gutter I had fallen into and they helped me, Kiki!  I mean, they kind of did.. Well, they tried.  I lost a lot more than I was aware of when I joined, but that is what everyone says at some point or another. I lost the innocence of the child I used to be, I hardly think you would even recognize me anymore. I have not grown cold to the suffering of others though; I have kept your memory alive by giving all of me to those in need. I still remember that dog we almost hit coming back from Mo\u2019s welcome back party for us, you were out of that car comforting that stinking dog before I even knew what happened! I still think you jumped out of a moving car.  You can be humble all you like babe, I don\u2019t have to be ;)   I remember the tears on Ms. J's face when we brought that dog back to her. You know, I saw her last year.  She asked where you were.  When I told her you \u201cweren\u2019t around anymore\u201d she looked at me differently.  I think she thought you left me, I don\u2019t blame her.  I didn\u2019t have the heart to tell her you had died.  She is so old now, Kiki. I mean real old.  Her dog passed away a few years ago apparently, I didn\u2019t feel like pressing her anymore so I bought her coffee and told her that I was glad we could give her those years with her pup.  That makes me smile even now.  You did good for others even after you died!  \n\n I have missed you so much baby\u2026 I have dreamed of this moment for over a decade now and I can barely think of a thing that has happened to tell you now that I have you here.  Oh! I finished school!  I got my AA, BA, MA, and I have so many certificates now it would make your head spin!  You already know what I went with, Kiki.  I even did my MA overseas!  I got to live for two years in the one place I wanted to take you.  God I fucking missed you there. I don\u2019t know if you heard me on the beach the night before I left but it reminded of meeting you that beautiful day.  I still can\u2019t believe you are gone\u2026 After you passed I didn\u2019t know what to do.  I still don\u2019t.  I wish I could ask for your help now; life was so easy no matter what happened as long as we were together. I am sorry to tell you this but I did start dating again, it was a huge mistake. I swear before everything I have ever loved that nothing and no one could ever fill the hole in my chest left from the loss of you. She abused me Kiki, badly.  I was taken for everything I had, though that wasn\u2019t really much.  I am embarrassed to tell you this, I am sure you saw though.  I felt a guilt like I never knew before when I was with her.  I know you are going to be angry with me for feeling guilty but it is an anger I will welcome, to feel your anger at me now would be to bathe in decadence. To know you were here and angry at me, just in the the other room would bring me home.  I would finally be home again, I could apologize for the anger.  I could even lose you to that anger and be happy to watch you walk away but know that the world still had you in it would be worth it.  I know you only want my happiness, I know you want me to be ok.  I just... can't.  I have tried for years, Kiki. You left me so long ago now, you took my heart the day I met you and I took your pain the day you left me.  I have held it, I have never let it go.  The pain reminds me of you.  The pain reminds me of seeing you for the last time that day.  You laid there, merely a shadow of the woman I fell for all those years before.  I kissed you as you died. I kissed you as I died, Kiki. Oh my dear, I have so lost my way.  I have grown so tired of standing post.  I followed you into the dark that day all those years ago even though I promised you I wouldn\u2019t, I had no choice.  I felt a part of me die with you. That day when you passed, I went out on the stairs to smoke and dad came out to sit with me and comfort me (the man just lost his daughter and he was comforting ME!. Can you believe that?  Well, of course you can but still, he never stopped being the father he was to you and the man he was to me) and he smoked a cig with me.  Never said a word, he just knew somehow what to do.  He just leaned his shoulder against mine ever so slightly.  Fucking hell that meant the world to me.  \n\nI remembered I owe you an apology as well.  I am so sorry for your funeral.  I am sorry for yelling but they had no right to smile on that day.  I don\u2019t care what their reason was, it was disrespectful to you and to us.  But, I am sorry.  I know that was not the way to handle things. Dad saved me, yet again, that day.  As always, the picture of compassion and composure.  Whew, I cry at the drop of a hat or even specific smells these days.  Not very manly but idgaf, there is no one left on Earth I care about impressing.  As far as what I did, I was trying to wake you up. I thought there was some possibility that if I was loud enough you might respond. I don\u2019t know why, it might have been because I couldn't stop thinking about your fear of being buried alive.  Perhaps I just had to be sure. Perhaps I lost my mind briefly and wanted you to let me in so I could come with you. Either way, dad saved me. Please thank him for me. And please tell him I love him.  I didn\u2019t get a chance to say that to him again before he left us. I have so much to apologize for, I have tried so hard to be like he was.  I have done for others as I had done for me, I have cared for those who no one cared for, I have kept my faith in the good in our world but I steel feel as if a failure.  I have lost my track and no longer feel that I will help the world stop it\u2019s fighting.  I feel lost and groundless, merely floating through an existence that teases me with promises of you. Everything I see makes me want to run and tell you about it and it makes me cry every time.  I thought about writing this to you long ago\u2026 but I never did. Quite honestly, it is something I wanted to do but was scared to do.  I mean, how would I end this?  I never wanted you to go in the first place, I never want to end this letter.  Wow, to be honest, I briefly almost felt like I was talking to you.  I felt almost like I was just writing letters to you again.  Why are we cursed with a permanent LDR, Kiki?  Why wont the world let us be together? God these tears, they never stop.  Fucking hell, my sweet beautiful Kiki, I wish I could come home to you right now.  I would but I made a promise to you.  I will wait.  I will exist for just a while longer but someday soon, I will be coming home.  I pray that it won't be long.  I pray I dont have much longer to wait.  I will come home to you and we will have our family again.  I miss you my love.  I miss everything about you.  The worst day we ever had together is unmeasurably better than the best day I have ever had without you.   \n\nI think I might go up to the lake, I wonder if that cabin is still there.  I should probably not go back there, seeing it going would destroy me.  The memories we shared in that house, good lord.  We lost our virginity in that cabin.  God damn I can\u2019t believe how beautiful you are.... were.  I saw your soul that day and I fell in love.  I never understood what you saw in me but after a while, I didn\u2019t care.  You are the best \u201cthing\u201d (yes I did the air quotes, Kiki :P) to ever happen to me, even though we both know I never think of you as a thing.  You were my partner and you always will be.  You ARE my love and you always will be.  You are my world and you ALWAYS will be.  I am going to sign off now, baby but I will only say goodbye for now, I will write again soon.  Before I go, I want you to read these lyrics from a song I found that makes me feel like you are just about to knock on the front door.  I am ready to answer, Kiki.  It's been too long.  The song is very brief, don\u2019t worry my love.  \n\n\n\n\"I can't stop thinking about how nice it would be to be bothered by your breath reclaiming mine.  \n\nTo wake up in the morning half dead to you unable to find a place to rest your arms.\n\nI can't move 'cos he's comfortable there his legs tangled in mine hands tangled in hair.  \n\nI can't move 'cos he's comfortable there.\"\n\n\n\nI miss you more than I thought someone was capable of.  I am thinking of you always.  Your baby loves you, Kiki.  For now, for tomorrow, and for ever.   \n\n\n\n\nYours forever through time, \nC.G.\n", "subreddit": "GriefSupport"}

I'm 27, I have my own home (inherited), a full-time job, a car and I'm getting married in two months. But that's just the surface level. I'm not happy. In fact I'm profoundly unhappy.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI've lost one family member every year for the last four years, first my grandmother, then father, then grandfather and most recently my mother (earlier this month).  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nUp until the the loss of my mother I felt like I coped pretty well with death. It always just kind of rolled off my back because I knew there were more people around to help out. I lived with my mum for literally my entire life, right up until the day she died. She was severely disabled with MS, so I acted as a part-time carer when I wasn't at work during the day. I have an older brother who never did much to help out, and I'm fairly certain he's an alcoholic.  There is no other remaining family apart from him.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt was never an easy relationship with my mum as she was quite an outspoken and abrasive person. I loved her, but our opinions on many things were dissimilar at best. I harbour an immense amount of guilt for not giving her as much care as she needed. I always tried my best, but carer burnout is real. After 4 or 5 nights in a row of being woken up at 1am, 3am and 5am to her screaming and helping her out of bed just so she could stretch (sometimes this could happen up to four times a month) I would get frustrated with her. Unfortunately the night before she died I said some rude things - not terrible - but I guess I was just fed up with constantly being expected to look after her at the expense of myself.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe next morning I went to work and everything was fine. I spoke to her briefly and she was the same as always. By the time I got home at 6:30 she was dead. Apparently her heart failed. She had been sending text messages to her friends like any normal day all the way up to 2pm. I actually drove past the house around that time as I was going out for lunch. I considered stopping in quickly to say hi but chose not to. I still regret that decision.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWith all my other relatives who have passed away, their deaths felt inevitable and I had time to come to terms with them. My grandparents and my father died in hospital beds after prolonged stays. There was plenty of time to accept their fate and have a last conversation with each of them. With my mum I feel like there was so much left unsaid and there was so much she wanted to accomplish with the limited mobility she still had. She was planning to go on a cruise later this year.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nReading her diary has been immensely saddening. She had so many events lined up, not least my wedding. It's devastating that she won't be there. I respected her so much despite any disagreements we may have had. She was a mighty woman for enduring decades of chronic pain and caring for all my other, now deceased, family members when they were sick.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI don't feel like I can talk to any of my friends or even my fiancee because none of them would understand. I can barely even get out of bed in the morning. My mum's death seems like it was the straw that broke the camel's back. I've been off work for almost a month and I feel terrible about it, but I just can't face the reality of having to talk to so many people who will just want to share their shallow condolences and ask me a million questions about what happened. I mean even at the god damn funeral people were asking me whether my brother and I were planning to sell my mum's house. Seriously?!?  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI've never felt so depressed in my entire life. I put on a brave face for everyone I know. I'm not sure my fiancee understands just how bad it's gotten as we still live separately until the wedding. Every day I just feel like I'm going to implode from the effort of plastering a fake smile on my face. I would never go as far as taking my own life, I know that much. But how am I supposed to cope? Nobody I know has lost so many relatives in such a short period of time. Most people I know haven't lost any.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nToday I nearly broke off my engagement and quit my job in a fit of anxiety - in retrospect both would have been terrible choices so I'm glad I didn't do either. It's just this awful situation where I feel like I don't deserve sympathy because to other people it looks like my life is pretty well constructed. Maybe constructed out of toothpicks and tissue paper...  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe worst thing of all is how people show so much sympathy in the first week after a family death and then it all just stops abruptly. Like everyone suddenly stops caring and you have to just get over it. I don't know if I'm just entering the anger phase of grieving or something, but none of it feels fair.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnyway, if you managed to read that mess I appreciate your time.

He\u2019d been ill, but was getting better.  Out of the ICU, out of the hospital, out of short-term rehab.  He\u2019d been home for a week and each day, he\u2019d felt better than the last.  Then, a pulmonary embolism.\n\nI\u2019m grateful that it was as fast and painless as can be; I\u2019m grateful that he\u2019d gotten to come home where he could sleep in his own bed, eat home-cooked meals, and play with the cats; I\u2019m grateful that he still had hope for the future and didn\u2019t have to look ahead to nothing but frustration, invalidism, and decline.\n\nI\u2019m grateful that our relationship didn\u2019t become burdened by the obligations of caretaking, and I\u2019m grateful that my mother is young and healthy enough to bounce back to make a new life for herself as a widow and not just resign herself to waiting for her own death.  Those sentiments may seem cold, but I need to look ahead with some optimism.\n\nWhen my parents moved in with me three years ago, my condo suddenly seemed so cramped.  Now, it feels terribly empty.  Before he retired, my dad\u2019s work took him on long business trips, including stretches when he lived overseas and I didn\u2019t see him for months or even a year.  That second day, I told myself, *okay, he\u2019s only out of town*, to be able to press ahead for a little while \u2013 but I just want him to come home.\n\nMy S.O. lost his dad under similar circumstances about five years back, and my mom\u2019s sister lost her husband after a long illness only ten days before she my dad died.  So we\u2019ve got a good support system of loving people who can personally relate \u2013 but at the end of the day, it\u2019s just the two of us.  We did well that first week, but then we both came down with colds, and so it\u2019s harder to keep each other up and going.  We know it\u2019s okay *not* to be up and going, but the extra weariness and isolation of being sick isn\u2019t what we need right now.\n\nMy mother is my best friend, but my father and I were also very close.  We shared many negative traits, and he taught me a lot about how to deal with them, overcome them, make them into positives (and he was happy when I\u2019d learn from his mistakes).  He was both traditional and unconventional; he showed me an excellent example of secure masculinity (he was a guy who\u2019d work all day on a car engine, then trim his cuticles and buff his nails in the evening), and did all the things with me that he\u2019d do with a son.  He was stubborn as hell but could admit when he was wrong.  Even when we\u2019d bicker, it was always soon forgotten or put aside. \n\nWe knew each other so well, and I don\u2019t believe anything was left unsaid.  But goddamnit, he was only 73.  He said once that he\u2019d be lucky to make it to 80, and I thought at the time that he was probably right about that.  I also figured there\u2019d be a good chance he\u2019d go hard and fast \u2013 in fact, I hoped he would, rather than the alternative.

It used to chill her or make her sad; she says it\u2019s a nice feeling now because it\u2019s a reminder that he\u2019s with her after all these years.

There are five of us kids, I am the youngest. I have two sisters and two brothers. Our father passed away on March 13th. My mother has been completely off her rocker in terms of letting us grieve. Meaning that she is completely fine, it's almost as if she's glad he's dead, and she's on the Power Trip basically. So my brother is claiming that a friend of his at work needs a car desperately, So he is wanting to sell my dad's car. I just don't see how this could be good. I mean we haven't even been without my dad for a month. I feel like they are trying to erase him or pretend that he never existed. I don't understand what the big hurry is. Basically, my two brothers think it's okay to sell the car and the girls myself and my two sisters think it's way too soon. My one brother was not around while my dad was in hospice or around for any of the planning of the funeral Etc. But now that there's money involved he's become very active with my mother who has a brain the size of a pea. I have no respect for her because she can't think for herself. Anyway, my brother said that the first person to cough up $1,500 can have the car. So one of us can buy it if we are opposed to the idea of getting rid of it. I am just beside myself over this. I don't know how to handle it. I don't think it's a money issue because my dad had like three life insurance policies. I have so much panic and anxiety over this. It makes me really want to cut them off.", "subreddit": "GriefSupport"}

I would like to share my story.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI will be turning 23 this year, this year marks the 10th and 15th anniversary of my mom's and dad's passing. They both had left this world due to natural causes; forms of stroke. I lost my dad on Chinese New Year, when I was 8, there's a Chinese taboo that says if a relative were to die during the (Chinese) New Year, 4 years of bad luck would befall on their closest next of kin. I lost my mom after a phenomenal first trip to Japan, one we had been planning many years into, promising we'd be going again in the next year, I was to turn 13 later that year.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI didn't know my dad that much, nor did I hear that much from my mom. I only knew him as an abusive man. He'd always shout and beat my mom. I never knew the full details, I was told that my parents were living on a very tight budget when they married and had me. This stress surely drove them both up the wall, and so with every little mistake I made, I got a beating in return. I never hated them both, domestic violence and child abuse was a foreign concept until I become much older. Over the years, I'd always wish to tell my dad of my exploits growing up.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI've always thought of my mom as an elder sister to me. We look nearly identical, I'm taller than her by a head or so, people would mistake us as siblings (Asian genes making her look younger than she ought to be). Through that 5 year gap between losing my dad and losing her; we bonded lots, at a price of some sort. My mom used to be the safe-haven when my dad would start ensuing hell upon me, that quickly changed when the burden got heavier on my mom who then became a single working mother. She'd have 3-4 hours of sleep, on the edge and working her butt off to support us both. As a result, I missed a lot of school, being super behind in class, helping my mom with her work.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'd go to my mom on stuff at school I didn't understand. I'd never get the material right on the first go and it'd tick off my mom, escalating the entire thing to a beating and disown threats. That continued for 4 years, a cycle of threats, beatings, and even one breaking point where she opened the balcony of our 20th floor apartment, telling me she couldn't take it anymore. But she stopped, and turned back to me; *\"But who will take care of you?\"*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEventually and somehow, things got uphill from there. My grades were still kinda shit, but my mom striked gold in her job and got a promotion. This was the 5th year anniversary of my dad's passing. A memorable year, full of happy moments and not a time my mom ever hit me nor shout at me. It was a peaceful year. Then I dreamed that my mom died in my arms. I woke up frantically with a tight chest, my mom quickly came to my side and asked what was wrong. I told her, she comforted me and told it was going to be alright, she would never leave me. This was a few months prior to her passing.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOne night her bodily functions just failed. She couldn't stand nor speak properly. She told me to quickly get a pen and paper, struggling to write something. *\"I love you\"*, it said, my heart instantly sank and I quickly called the ambulance. I was with her the entire time right till the doctor pronounced her dead. I felt the rigor mortis kicking in while I held tightly on mom's hand, all thoughts went out my head. I didn't want to function. A good friend of my mom's sent me back home. The house was empty and quiet. I prepared my mom's bed, hoping she'd come back and sleep. Waking up the next morning, reality was not even close to setting in. When the day she was resting in her casket arrived, she was smiling. I realized, she finally got the sleep she wanted. 5 years of not being able to sleep properly because of work.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAfter the funeral service, I was there to see her off the mortuary, that was when it really set in. I said goodbye to the casket as the conveyor belt carried it to the flames.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI celebrated my start of my teen years with my granny and my mother's sisters. I was adopted by one of the sisters who were close to my mom. The next few years didn't bode well with my PTSD unconsciously acting up on me, making my guardian re-enact my mom's beatings and threats on me. I don't know how I made it this far without wanting to end it all by my hand, honestly, I wanted to, the day my mom left. Maybe the mental image of not wanting to disappointing my mom by doing things the easy way kept me on this Earth.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTill this day, my trauma still haunts me, I'm currently doing a dental degree, episodes of my mom smacking me over a small mistake pulls me down. I never had the habit of diligently studying everyday, but I am slowly building up that habit. I do have episodes of missing my parents and just breaking down in tears time to time as well as dreams of them. One where it was like any day after school, with us both headed down to the office for my mom to do her work while I waited outside for her meeting to finish, we drove around town, through the night. When dawn arrived, she dropped me off somewhere, I remembered the fact that she had already been gone. I always visualize myself talking to my folks of the stuff I did and achieved and times where my mom is just on a long, long business trip, only for her to pick me up when my *time* is done.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nDeath has taught me many lessons. But it did leave me a heavy burden.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf you have read the entire thing, I would like to extend a very heartfelt thank you to you, for hearing out on my story.", "subreddit": "GriefSupport"}

I want to be in shape and not so blah right now. So nothing. So pointless. I just feel like I\u2019ll never see that girl again.. \n\nAt least for a long time. \n\nThere\u2019s so much I can\u2019t fix, change, and even control... I\u2019m helpless in the fact that everything is out of my control, even the way I look and feel. \nI can\u2019t control my depression and make it go away. \nI can\u2019t control my anger as much as I try... it\u2019s stemming from deep within. \nI can\u2019t control to be happy... \n\nIt\u2019s like everyday I\u2019m putting on this fake mask to everyone in my life, pretending and acting like I\u2019m ok, or quote on quote happy. I fake smile and pretend to enjoy it all when in reality.. my own reality it\u2019s awful. Im dying inside at the thoughts I\u2019m becoming. I am autopilot self destructing machine. I never I thought I could ever do this to myself and everyone around me. \n\nI\u2019m going to lose everything I\u2019ve worked so hard for, just because I\u2019ve only wanted to not feel again. \n\nIt\u2019s hard to explain... when you feel literally everything,... all at once. and it\u2019s a constant mix of terrible emotions; you\u2019d give anything not to feel a single thing again. You only hope you can handle it but it begins to break you. Little by little. Inch by inch, until you finally are brittle pieces that can\u2019t be put back together \n\nSadness, anger, love, hate, humor, laughing, fighting, fatigue, hunger, sleep, all of it. \n\nYou want it to just all go away. Be numb. A outlet that cures all for maybe just a few minutes or hours. \n\nBut then it hits. It was on a temporary fix. \n\nSo you keep temporary fixing as much as you can just to feel numb and normal again.\n\n\u201cIs it worth it?\u201d..I ask the girl starring back at me in the mirror. \n\u201c No, \u201c\n\nThen why the fuck do you keep doing this. \n\nYou\u2019re going to lose everything. \n\nYour job \nYour boyfriend \nYour home \nYour life \nYour family \nYour mom \nYour everything.\n\n-I\u2019m going to lose my mom. I\u2019m losing a part of my life and home. And it\u2019s out of my control. The only control I have is to how I feel. To what I do and how I act upon. When I\u2019m like this I feel back to the old me. And none of the medicine I\u2019ve been taking for over a year has even come close to this. It\u2019s high euphoria I can\u2019t get on my own anymore. And it\u2019s miserable and heartbreaking. \n\nI\u2019ve lost. And I\u2019m broke more than glue can begin to fix. \n\nI don\u2019t recognized the girl in the pictures \n\nor the girl wanting to punch the mirror because the girl looking back is not the person I want to be. \n\nHow could I let it get this far.. and still want it? \n\nI thought I could change I\u2019ve pep talked myself, \n\u201cJust one, and that\u2019s it. \u201cYeah right!\n\nThen before I know it 4:00 rolls around and I feel Great, but my anxiety kicks in and my anger at myself of what the fuck were you thinking... and yet I\u2019d still bring myself to do more. \n\nLike how. \nAnd I honestly I don\u2019t know. It\u2019s weird.. the high, is what I\u2019ve been searching for. \n\nAnd when it goes away it sinks in how real everything becomes. How pointless; sad and scary it really becomes. \n\nSleep is also a strange thing for me... night terrors \nVidid dreams, down to every last detail... \nblood and dying \nSad and nightmares \nWaking up knowing some of them will come true \nWatching loved ones die in my dreams almost every night. Why would I want to sleep. \n\nI wake up, and the shadows are lurking. Death shadows lurking. \n\nThat\u2019s another thing, with the high, the shadow people are in the most full affect I could have ever experienced as a kid.. they\u2019re definitely 2.0 shadows and more like human ghosts; and with voices instead of quite mumbling or none at all. \n\nSo yeah, I\u2019ve lost it. \n\nAnd Im trying and get it back. \n\n\nThe saddest part of my journey is when I go to the therapist and they ask me on my daily questioner, \n\nDo you look forward to the future,/how do you feel about the future?\n\nAnd my answer is always very and never, I don\u2019t. I have nothing to look forward too, my moms dying in the near future, how can I look forward to time going faster and sadder than it already is?... \n\nThe year she dies, then the first year without her... how I\u2019ll deal and how I\u2019ll learn to cope and LIVE. Like what a future I have to look forward too... come on.\n\nBut I have to remember she wants me to strive on, and make her proud. So I\u2019ll have to try.. because if I don\u2019t I know she\u2019ll be disappointed and I want to just make her proud; I always have. That\u2019s all I\u2019ve ever wanted, but right now I\u2019m failing. And I\u2019m sorry, and I wish saying sorry was so sugar coated, it would be something better. But I\u2019m not better and I\u2019m sick. And mentally have to much to begin to attack. And I tried to do it all and I\u2019ve lost. \n\nAgain. \nI\u2019ve made a lot of mistakes. And I fucked up once again. \n\nSpeaking of fucking up things. My fears are now becoming closer to my reality.\n\nI\u2019m terrified out of my mind. \nYet my depression is holding me back and my anxiety is pulling in on me. I\u2019m drowning, constantly. I\u2019m drowning and I\u2019m freaking out times million, but drowning with depression, you think to yourself \u201cis it all that bad drowning after all?\u201d I can\u2019t move anyways... \nAnxiety thinks of the worst case scenario; and you fucking panic, and you can\u2019t breathe, while depression just lets you sink and you have no fight in you to stop it. \n\nIt\u2019s a trip when you have both. You fight with your body and mind about any and every. That\u2019s why I\u2019m scared. \n\nI\u2019m so scared that I will sabotage myself and ruin the perfect relationship I\u2019ve ever had. The perfect man. The perfectly imperfect love. This. Us. It was fate and the stars some how aligned for us. \nBut...I\u2019m so scared that I will lose him in the end. I won\u2019t be just losing my mom but Ill also being losing Sean. This man has been the Prince Charming of my dreams. He is my person, he\u2019s my everything I\u2019ve could have ever needed, wanted and desired. He is the love I\u2019ve been waiting for. He\u2019s the love and the man I cried about when the ones hurt me in the past. He\u2019s the guy I\u2019d been hoping to find, and I thought he was made up, but I found him. \n\nBut things like this, can ruin relationships. Death can ruin us. How long can he take for putting up with finding myself again? How long can he hear me cry about her? How long can he stand for this? How long can sit and wait for me to be better, when maybe someone else is better comes along? There\u2019s going to be a day where he\u2019ll accidentally say something like it\u2019s been (this long) and your still crying every day. \nHow long can somebody put up with that? Sadness; depressed; moped out and drugged out girlfriend? How long can he be okay with this... \nbecause it\u2019s already been too long so far and I can see it. \n\nI see it in his eyes, I\u2019ve seen him ask me to maybe times, and me apologizing for it too many overdo times. Yet I keep doing it and the sorry\u2019s aren\u2019t cutting it anymore. \nI see his dissatisfaction and disappointment of, \u201cdid you not sleep again?\u201d\nAnd I reluctantly have to try to explain myself and my mind of emotionless numbing and fighting my inner demons... but the words never come out, \n\nIt\u2019s just, a blank stare and \u201cyes I did, let me explain\u201d, but even he knows even if I tried it\u2019s not good enough. \n\nI\u2019m not enough for him. He deserves better, than this. Especially this, and what I am. And who I\u2019ve become. \n\nHe never asked for this, but neither did I. \nThe famous books always say, if you love something, you sometimes have to let it go. \nThe movie with the wild horse, no matter how much the girl loved the horse, he belonged in the wild, he craved it. He was slowly dying inside himself without the wild. She knew if she let him go, there love would always carry on. \n\nSean, maybe I have to let you go so I don\u2019t drag you into this toxic, and nasty environment. Maybe this wasn\u2019t your willpower and strength to overcome, but mine. \nThere\u2019s nothing that can fix any of this. The problems , the cancer , the everything , \n\nYou\u2019re trying so hard to make me happy again, and giving me extra love I could have ever wanted; but I know I don\u2019t act appreciative. But when, do you just give in. And give up? When have you exhausted all efforts and it\u2019s still not good enough? \nWhen will you turn else where to have someone appreciate your all?... \n\nBecause I\u2019m not doing a very good job at it. And you deserve the world my love,... \n\nThe wild free world. You deserve it all. \n\nAnd I can\u2019t give it to you. I can\u2019t give it to you right now. And I so badly wish I could. I wish I could fix me, and be back to the way things were. But I can\u2019t. I can\u2019t fix or control any of it. \n\nYou deserve someone to give you their all; you deserve it all the time. You give me all your love; 150 percent of the time and I\u2019ve been shutting it out. \n\nI\u2019ve shut the whole world out, and now I have to figure out how to find my way back in, while in the mists of darkness and black hole I\u2019m in. \n\nYou don\u2019t deserve to be pulled down by my actions, you deserve better.\nMaybe you should let me go, because I\u2019m not the best I can be for you? \n\nI love you with all my heart, more than the stars in the sky and the fish in the sea, for all eternity. \n\nBut I\u2019ve not been giving you the love you so effortlessly need. The attention, the love, the talks and the laughs: \n\nI need to find myself, and pick the girl up and love her..:before I can do it for you, \n\nAnd I want to be able to for you so badly inside, it hurts. My heart hurts, my heart hurts for you and your love. \n\nI\u2019m just not me anymore. I don\u2019t know who I am anymore. And it\u2019s frightening to look and see the person I\u2019ve so easily become. And for the finale time, I\u2019m sorry doesn\u2019t mean anything. I\u2019m sorry doesn\u2019t even count. It sounds bullshit. It\u2019s sounds like a lie and it\u2019s not fixing anything to make up for the past. \n\nI wish I wasn\u2019t like this. But it\u2019s who I\u2019ve now become. I have to want to change. And I have to learn to train my body and my mind that I need and should change. For now, in this moment I\u2019m struggling to adapt and want to do this. I wish I wasn\u2019t dependent on a substance to make me happy, but at the same time what are my pills supposed to do anyway.. \n\nI\u2019m having to be so dependable on something to make me happy. And it\u2019s fucking sad. It makes me numb to everything that\u2019s happening to me. \nSo at the start of a new day I\u2019m reminded I have a pill for everything..\nA pill to make me flat minded. A pill to calm me down. A pill to make me stop crying. A pill to help me sleep. A pill to take the pain away. A pill to help me ease into the work day. \nHow about some one find me a pill to make it all go away. \n\nI can\u2019t describe to you how some days I wish I wouldn\u2019t wake up. I can\u2019t believe I can even fathom that. Or begin to say that sentence, but I feel it. I feel all the time. \n\nThis depression and the combos of everything on top has my mind trapped in something I\u2019ve never experienced like before. \n\nThere are aches on my body that I haven\u2019t prior hurt the day before. I feel like my heart got punched but from my chest wall in. It\u2019s like something is sitting on my chest drilling a hole that can\u2019t be filled. \n\nWhen I wake up I feel as if I\u2019m always sick, and I then no longer want to even try to get up. I feel sick and nauseous at the thought of getting out to face the day. \n\n(Why. What\u2019s the point. Does it matter. I don\u2019t matter. I don\u2019t feel. Why.)\n\nIt\u2019s strange being massively depressed, you don\u2019t feel a lot of anything. So when you do get emotions of any kind, they\u2019re to the ultimate max and extreme. \nAnger turns into a fight of rage. Crying, when you finally cry, becomes heretical sobbing on the floor. Hunger, is a odd one. You\u2019ll crave this food item, and two or three bites in, it no longer is appetizing. You only eat when you\u2019re absolutely starving, which is maybe once a day if that. And you just kind of eat but forget because you\u2019re no longer craving. Nothing at all. \nWhen you\u2019re not feeling anything, the slight feeling of goosebumps or chills, from after a shower gives you some sense that maybe you can still have a slight feeling of hope. But after taking a look at yourself in the steam lit mirror; it then soon just fades away.\n\nBeing depressed, the world and your life feels, smells and looks different. The sun doesn\u2019t feel as warm as it use too. When you put your hand out the window, the wind doesn\u2019t wrap your fingers like you remember.\n\n\n\n", "subreddit": "GriefSupport"}

When it was happening, I was nonstop crying -- I was sobbing for about 48 hours straight, not eating. My SO had never seen me like that, so dead-eyed and depressed; he said I was like a completely different person. But now, already so soon, I'm going about my days like normal. I'm smiling and laughing, I'm remembering my cat with fondness and distant sadness, and I'm able to talk about her and memories of her without crying. I still pour over pictures and videos of her, but it's like my sadness is so far away now.\n\nShe had a stroke in January, so we knew this was coming -- I just didn't know it would be so soon. When we left for a weekend visit that Saturday, she was perfectly fine. Her stroke had left her half-blind and half-deaf so it was a transition, but she had learned to live with her disabilities since her stroke and was still such a happy and sweet cat, snuggling with us and getting excited for her wet food every day and even going up and down the stairs all day long. Then, when we came home on Sunday night, we knew immediately something was wrong. The apartment smelled bad, like a bad litterbox. Marshmallow didn't come running to the door to greet us like she usually did. I panicked. We started running all around looking for her, and finally found her huddled under the bed against the wall. I knew instantly that it was happening, that cats seek solitude like that. She must have had another stroke while we were gone. At first, I felt horrible that I hadn't been there, but I know that we couldn't have known. It would have happened whether we were there or not, and what mattered was that we could be there for her now.\n\nMy friends came together to support me financially through her euthanasia and cremation. They were so amazing -- I was so scared that I wouldn't be able to afford the kind of dignified death that she deserved. I had her for 15 years, she got me through my dad's death and all my struggles growing up... I wanted to give her the painless passing she deserved. She made it through that first night but was even worse in the morning, obviously fully blind. I stayed home from work and stayed with her all day, helping her along, checking on her throughout the day, keeping her warm and comfortable, until we could all get together and take her to the vet one last time together. I held her in my lap while it happened. She stretched out her paw over my legs like a hug, like a final thank you, and then went to sleep forever.\n\nMaybe I'm wrong, because now I'm crying again. I still have her daughter, Mittens, who I've had since the day she was born -- she means absolutely everything to me, and I've been watching her closely since her mother's passing to watch any changes in her behavior. They were so close, always cuddling and sleeping together and grooming each other. I think she knows that Marshmallow isn't coming home. She's a little more noisy, a little more clingy, but I'm more than happy to give her all the love she needs. She keeps me going when I get low, because I still have to be her mom and take care of her.\n\nIt's hard... It's hard to understand my own feelings, because they change so rapidly. When my dad died when I was 11, I wasn't able to properly grieve, and didn't start that process until I was 16. Losing Marshmallow was so painful, but in a different way, because for the first time it all hit me at once, not over the years like losing my dad. I still cry over his loss, and I still talk to him and hold his pictures to my heart. My SO said that Marshmallow is probably somewhere with him, and I started bawling because that made me feel so, so much better.\n\nMaybe I'm just having a good day and overthinking things. Maybe I will be okay. But it's hard not to feel bad about it. After 15 years, I can just take a few days and be fine? It feels so wrong. I still miss her, but I'm really okay, and that feels terrible sometimes. I feel guilty. I know that doesn't mean that I didn't love her, because of course I did -- I loved her so, so much, and I would have done anything to help her. But at the same time, I think the way it all happened helped me. Because I was able to help her this final time, to take away her pain, and now her ashes will be with me forever in a beautiful urn... It all happened as perfectly as something like this could go.\n\nI don't think I ever understood the ritual of death when it comes to the living. Why funerals are so important, and why they happen the way they do. I was too young when my dad died to understand it all -- I couldn't process why we were doing the things we were doing. It was all just sad, and I wanted to run away from it all. But this time, with Marshmallow, I tried my best to accept everything as it was happening, and really face it head on, and somehow, I think that helped more than I ever thought possible.\n\nI'm still stuck in between feeling good and bad. Feeling glad and guilty. But I know that wherever she is, she knows how much I love her. When she was cremated, the guys there gave me half a golden heart and put the other half in with her, and I carry it around with me every day so she knows I'm there. I wish I could hold her, and feel her soft little fur and paws again, but I know that wherever she is, she's warm and soft and happy and healthy.\n\nI don't know what my point here is... I guess, it's just so complicated. Every grief is different from the next.", "subreddit": "GriefSupport"}

It was by far the hardest day since he died, including the funeral.  \n\nTomorrow his mother and I are hosting what has become a huge event to honor the homeless Veterans in the largest city near us.  At the height of his addiction Michael was one of thousands of homeless Veterans, and we decided to do this in order to honor him while drawing attention to a forgotten group of people who so desperately deserve our respect and our gratitude.  At the same time it will help bring attention to the fact that 45% of homeless Veterans suffer from PTSD, and 70% suffer from Substance abuse (including alcoholism) - there is an overlap between the two statistics.  \n\nWe have a venue and will be feeding the Veterans, we have barbers coming to donate their time to give them haircuts and beard trims, we have community resources coming for housing and substance abuse so they can get information on help in a nonthreatening environment.  We have backpacks filled with tons of items that are useful if you are homeless, that often people don't think of when making up bags for them (things like duct tape, rain ponchos, thermal mylar rescue blankets, first aid kits etc.) as well as the standard things (toothbrush, toothpaste, comb etc.).  The local elementary school made card thanking them for their service; something done for active duty soldiers, but that I can almost guarantee these Veterans have never received.  We have newspapers coming, the news station, the Mayor's office, and our state Senator.  We also have a personal gift from Michael for each Veteran.  \n\nThis has been an intensive labor of love.  Every single step of the way has been done to honor Michael and do something beautiful in his memory.  \n\nHere is what I have learned.  Nothing is going to make my grief less.  Nothing is going to make the missing him stop.  Nothing is going to take away the horrible pain of his loss.

It helps to know that instead of constantly watching me fall apart, he is able to see me draw strength from his memory to do something he would be so proud of.  \n\nHis mom and I will be starting a nonprofit next month in his name and will continue to do huge beautiful things in his name.

I was elated to receive my new gift, and promptly unfurled the blanket to test it out, 18 years later that same blanket still lays on my bed I can't sleep a wink without it. \n\nEventually life moved on, and I spent less time with my Mamaw as she grew more and more frail. I still visited at least once a week, but not as much as before. When I transferred from community college to a 4 year university, I barely got to see or talk to my Mamaw, since she could no longer use the phone due to bad hearing. I felt so disconnected. Fast forward to December 2017, and I'm preparing  to finish my degree and Mamaw asked what I wanted for a graduation gift, I told her a new blanket is the only thing I want. I finished my degree in May 2018 and decided to take a trip home to visit everyone. My first stop was her house, and I was met with the best surprise I could have asked for, a brand new hand sewn blanket, that turned out to be her last sewing project.\n\nHer health took a drastic turn this year, and her kidneys began to fail. I wish I could have seen her more, but I just started a new job and can't get any approved time off for the 3 months and had no way of making the trip. I will always feel a sense of guilt for not making that trip. \n\nMamaw I love you forever, and will always carry your love in my heart.", "subreddit": "GriefSupport"}

Perhaps they question their own mortality? It makes you feel like a burden. I miss my mum so much. We had a complicated relationship. She had an array of mental illnesses and I was homeless because of our strained relationship but always loved her, always will.

He was my best friend and huge teddy bear I needed him now more than ever before in life and it's all my fault hes dead. I've lost dogs before but never were directly responsible for one of their deaths. On top of that my family is completely heartbroken he always kept each of us company and played with us. I've never felt so many emotions before and all of them intense feelings of guilt sorrow and regret. He was MY dog, he always crawled into bed with me and brought me his toys and yesterday was his last day on Earth, and he spent it waiting for me all day.
