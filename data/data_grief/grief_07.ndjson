After I had left the room I started crying, because it made me miss her so much (it\u2019s been 4 years since she passed away). I don\u2019t know the last time I heard her voice, and I think I had almost forgotten what it sounded like. But when I heard it, it felt so familiar. So I had a really good cry after that.

I think about her every day and I often cry about her. Losing your relative to cancer is one thing, but the way she lost it just still baffles me, and makes me wonder if there really is such a thing as god. This is what would happen if someone would be taking pleasure from ruining someone's life.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFirst of all, we heard she was diagnosed with cervical cancer in Oct / Nov 2017. She had just returned from the United Kingdom (we're Dutch), where she studied and graduated in Health Sciences. She had done multiple studies, but this was the first one she could actually pursue a carreer in. And all of a sudden, she's deadly ill. Doctors told her her chances of recovery were very slim. She asked them if she could still have children after procedures were done, and doctors told her that her main concern should be surviving this illness. Right before she heard about all this, she got a new boyfriend who already had a 10 year old daughter. My sister treated her as if it was her own child. She went through everything and, in September of 2018, we heard that they could no longer find cancer in her body.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe was (as far as they can say such a thing at that time) cancer free. She was so happy. She went full speed forward, could get a new job, was going to marry her boyfriend (we went dress shopping with her) and started horse-back riding again. 4 months later, in December of 2018, she had her first check-up since she was declared cancer free.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n... And she had never been cancer free. She had grown a new tumor on her pancreas, which was 6x6cm (2,3inch x 2,3 inch) and it had already gotten to such a state in which doctors would no longer be able to cure it. My sister was going to die. Doctors gave her about one more year. One year, and she would no longer be here anymore. Her fiance and her tried to rush the wedding to a date way sooner, but then the husband went kinda rogue on her. He freaked out one night (I'm not sure what it was about), broke much of her stuff and kicked her out of the house. After this she contacted his exes and she found out he was hiding / lying about many things. The wedding was cancelled... Aside from all this she tried to find some distraction in doing horse-back riding competitions. Not far into 2019, she began suffering pain in her upper body. She tried to ignore this, but it got so bad she would be crawling on the floor in pain sometimes.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOne day after accomplishing one of her lifetime goals (becoming a Z-class horse rider) my family took her to the hospital. She was put on Morphine while doctors were trying to find out what was wrong. Once they found out, we weren't exactly happy... The tumor on her pancreas had grown to 10,5x10,5cm (4,1x4,1 inch) and was pressing on a nerve, and her stomach. She could eat less and less as this tumor kept growing. She was kept on 5.5mg Morphine per hour; for reference, 7-8 mg is enough to keep someone asleep. Her health was deteriorating quickly, and that's when she decided to go for euthanasia. She didn't want to have to wait till death came to get her, and while she was hoping to get out of the hospital quickly, she eventually knew that this is where she was going to die.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe Monday after her decision we lost her. I miss her so, so much and I still cannot believe she's gone. Then I look at the tattoo I got (she knew I was going to get one) and realize it's really true. How will I ever get over such an unfair loss.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nDoes anyone have any...

I grew up to be very close to him and admired him. He was my volleyball partner, my idol, and my best friend. He passed away last year. \n\nI also have a stepdad. He's been in my life since I was 8. He's always been a strict parent but I have lived with him and my mom from the age of 8 until I went to college. I was never emotionally close with him, but appreciate all the things that he has done for me and my family financially and for taking my brother and I in as his own children. I've always called both my stepdad and my real dad \"Dad\" or \"Daddy.\"\n\nIt's been almost a year since my real dad passed and I'm still grieving pretty badly. \n\nMY QUESTION:\nIs it wrong that it now bugs me that I call my stepdad \"Dad\"? I've made it a habit to call my stepdad \"my stepdad\" in front of my family and friends instead of \"Dad.\" Also, my brother mentioned to me that my stepdad would be walking down the aisle with me and dancing the father daughter dance with me at my wedding. Everytime I think about this, it makes me ball my eyes out because I don't want him to do those things. I want my real dad. The one that's not here anymore. I don't know if I'll ever feel like including my stepdad in these things and I really wouldn't want to hurt his feelings. I just feel like ever since my Dad passed, i've developed hard feelings towards my stepdad. It's hard to explain, but it kind of feels like I don't want my stepdad to be my dad anymore. I'm a 26 year old adult and this feeling of resentment makes me feel like I'm a child. However, I just can't get over it.  I hate that I feel this way towards him. I've looked this up on google, and there isn't anything at all about this situation. Am I wrong to feel this way and how do I get over it?", "subreddit": "GriefSupport"}

I need help processing", "author": "crushedheart0663", "self_text": "Like the title says, my mom died last week at the age of 54 of metastatic breast cancer. She was diagnosed about a year ago in a routine mammogram and at the time told me that her doctor couldn't assign a stage to it (which I thought was weird but she said it was just a tumor in her breast and her prognosis was good, needed chemo then a mastectomy). We live far apart right now but we are close--she truly was my best friend-- and speak almost every day. We saw each other every few months. She's not someone who wanted people talking to her all the time about cancer- she waited several months after diagnosis to tell extended family and friends. I tried to strike a balance between checking in on that specifically and having normal conversations.\n\nIt seemed to me she hit every roadblock imaginable on her cancer journey- she lost TONS of weight, surgery got delayed and delayed and delayed. We were all worried about her, and after some encouraging she got a second opinion at MD Anderson about 6 months ago, but decided to stick with her oncologist.\n\nThen she seemed to start feeling worse. I thought it was due to a year of nonstop chemo but that surgery would be very soon. But then she got pneumonia about a month ago. She was hospitalized for about a week and then released. That was a turning point- she seemed diminished after that.\n\nShe had chemo two Fridays ago. Then, the next night, she woke up and started yelling my dad's name. She couldn't tell he was there, holding her- she was delirious. He rushed her to the emergency room, where she had to be sedated. Apparently ,she had gone into multisystem organ failure. Scans at the ER showed the cancer had spread to her bones, lungs, brain and liver. She was put on a ventilator in a hope to help with something, but the doctors quickly advised that it wasn't survivable, and recommended turning the ventilator off. She had a DNR on file. \n\nI got on a plane and rushed to be by her side. I told her I loved her and held her hand while they ended life support. It all happened so fast.\n\nThen my dad found the medical records with her original diagnosis hidden in their closet. She was diagnosed at stage 4. It had already spread from her breast to her lymph nodes, bones and liver at the time she was diagnosed. My dad didn't even know the extent of it- she had been very private about her appointments and he thought it was just her way of coping.\n\nI don't know if she just kept the gravity of the situation from us because she wanted to be treated as normal as possible, or if she was deeply in denial or what. There were notes in her records from her doctors that they were concerned she wasn't processing the diagnosis. But my mom and I had planned the whole time that I would take a month off of work and come stay when she got her mastectomy, partially to spend time together and partially so I could help her and my dad. She seemed to be looking forward to that- I of course would have been there at any time if I knew it was stage four and there might never be surgery.\n\nMy dad demanded to go to her last chemo appointment with her because he had gotten really worried about her- she was super weak. At that appointment, her doctor apparently brought up to her for the first time that they at some point might need to change their focus to palliative care, but that they'd see how this new chemo went for a while. She said she didn't want to give up and that she didn't want to die. But she was dead, 48 hours later.\n\nOn top of the devastation that I'll never talk to her again- which I can't even start to comprehend yet- it is agony thinking about what she must have been through. It's pretty clear she suffered. But was she afraid? Did she worry we'd find out about the truth and be mad at her? Did she understand how serious this was, or was she in a sort of blissful denial?\n\nI am heartbroken. Cancer is so cruel\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEdit: Clarity", "subreddit": "GriefSupport"}

He was 84 and having age problems obviously, mainly respiratory. He passed 2 days ago. I had my last exam yesterday. His health wasnt that great in the last few days before his death. My family didnt tell me anything cus they wanted me to focus on my last exam so I dont fail cus they knew if they told me id just drop every fucking thing and come home. I get that they wanted me to study, I cant really say I blame them, and I know its been only 2 days, but... This guilt, the fact that I could not speak to him at least 1-2 days before his death or come to see him is eating me up inside. Its my first family death, like real close family death.

They were buried in somebody's back yard.", "author": "mellowhirls", "self_text": "My family is small and tightly knit. My parents have been married for nearly 40 years and I have two older sisters. We were raised well - we didn't have difficult childhoods.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy middle sister started her teen rebellion phase and never really left it. She moved out just after high school and lived a very chaotic life. She was a hard worker. She made friends easily and never hesitated to help somebody. She was a natural caretaker in a lot of ways, yet a terrible mother in several others.  \n\n\nMy sister was the sort to go from one bad boyfriend to the next. She was in an abusive relationship for years, and I was there alongside my family to pick her up every time she called crying or screaming. I was there for the police reports and restraining orders. I was there for every promise to leave and every promise broken.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe sadness and frustration of watching somebody you love return to a situation that is breaking them over and over again isn't something I can really describe. I know now that the psychology of abusive relationships is deeply rooted and she was only doing what thousands of others in abusive relationships have done, but that didn't change how I slowly began to resent her. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe were really close when I was in my teens, before the abuse started. We were really close for several years after that, too, but after she got pregnant and involved my nephew in the abuse, I started to hate her. I seen the effects of her on my parents and her son and I seen her deeply rooted refusal to leave or change and eventually just hearing her name made me so angry I would shake. A typical family gathering was her hungover and covered in bruises and spinning lie after lie and my nephew with his teeth blackened from bottle rot, panicking and crying if anybody even marginally raised their voice because his life was only ever anger and screaming.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI fought with my parents a lot about calling protective services. They told me it would ruin both of their lives and rip our family apart, so I didn't, for a long time, and the stress and worry I felt wondering if my nephew was okay seemed like it aged me a hundred years. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThings reached a crescendo when my parents found heroin in my sister's house. The details of the following weeks are mortifying and as much as I want to tell somebody about them - to have somebody understand what we all went through - I don't want further vilify my sister. She was very sick mentally, and she was addicted to drugs. She'd been through years of mental and physical abuse, and though her on paper her parenting was terrible, she loved her son intensely.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShortly after her drug problem became known, both she and my nephew disappeared. My parents dealt with it by not dealing with it. Not knowing where they were or if they were okay was a hell in and of itself, but not dealing with the emotional warfare of having a daughter addicted to drugs and begging for money but refusing help had to have been a relief.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI didn't always understand this at first. I'd get angry with them for not doing anything. I was the only one who hung fliers, who scouted out missing persons forums. I felt like I had to do what their fractured mindsets would not allow them to, even if I, too, was guiltily grateful for the peace in our lives.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nYou know how in movies and on TV they talk about knowing somebody was dead before finding out? I've sensed that my sister was dead for months. Like all of my efforts were a cry for help that would never come. Like deep down in my heart I feel my family - my love and connection to them - and her connection wasn't there anymore.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt was my third day at my new job when I got the phone call. I seen my mom on the caller I.D. and I knew something was wrong. She told me that they'd found the body of a woman and a child buried next door to where she'd lived. My mom was yelling at me and telling me to calm down because nothing was confirmed and my coworkers were standing around me asking what was wrong in 80 different ways while I sat on the floor and shook. I'd known what was wrong for months and the nights of feeling like my heart would explode in my chest from worry were finally coming to a head.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy beautiful, broken sister and my sweet, precious nephew. I'd been listing every major city in my state as possible locations when I circulated their missing persons ad and yet they were just a few blocks away from me the entire time, rotting in a shallow grave. A cause of death couldn't be determined because they were skeletal by the time they were found. That's okay. I don't want to know.

My grandfather was an amazing man. He was stubborn as hell and did things on his own time. He was always helping others but never wanted to accept help for himself. If he really cared about you...well everyone would not think he did haha be would give you so much grief and pretend to not really like you but that was his way of showing love. It took me well into my adulthood to see this about him and now it just makes me smile. He never criticized to be a jerk, he did it because he loved you and wanted it done right. His idea of showing love.... was the tough love aspect. He taught me what hard work really was, he taught me how to fish, he taught me if you want something you need to earn it. He taught me so much about respect and life in general. It pains me to know he is gone and no more stories to be heard, but I am so happy he is reunited with my grandma. Thank you so much Grandpa for being the hard worker you were! You taught my dad how to be an amazing man, father, and grandfather. You've showed my kids so much in life too and you will be greatly missed. Forever I will treasure the smell of your shop and seeing you in your dirty coveralls. Your hands worn with cuts and covered in grease. Your hanky hanging out of your back pocket, and your head full of knowledge... Plus your stubborn attitude and how you refused to be defeated. I am so incredibly proud to be your granddaughter! You will be missed by so many and you touched so many lives... I hope that I can follow in your footsteps and touch the world the way you did....  ps I also loved your moonshine and think I may have some of your stuff stashed somewhere....If I can find it we will drink to you!

We were very close, talking once or twice a week at least and I would visit her every chance we got when we were in town. \n\nYesterday we started our drive back home (we live all the way on the other side of the state now) and hit a bad thunderstorm on the highway about a mile from where she was found. It was like hitting a brick wall of rain, it was pouring down so bad. I saw it coming and slowed down to 60mph, 10 below the speed limit, but it wasn't enough. We hydroplaned back and forth across all three lanes of traffic and somehow managed to not cause an accident. All the drivers around me realized what was happening and backed off to give me room to gain control of my car. I finally caught traction as we hit the rumble strip on the side of the highway,and I slowly crept along the shoulder from there to the next exit. \n\nI truly believe my grandma was watching our for us.

She had been very stressed and i was happy for her to get to have a fun trip to look forward to. She posted on facebook about the trip and I was fixing to get to sleep (I work nights). \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWell, I woke up about a half hour or so later to my mom texting me saying that my dad (they are divorced) jumped to the conclusion that my wife (let's call her Amy) was going to vegas to get away from me, that she was probably going to have an affair with someone there, and that there was 'obviously' something wrong with our marriage. At first, he didn't even say what was up. He just beat around the bush, poked at the matter until I called the problem right out on the spot, and asked him why he texted Mom about it, let alone get his info straight.\n\nHe said that he \"felt like something was wrong in our marriage\" and suspected i was hiding stuff from him. He also straight up suggested that my wife was an adulterer and tried to pursued  me into getting some help to correct that.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI then asked again why he talked to Mom about this rather than just going straight to the source (me) of his concern. He said \"you never answer your texts, and I was worried so I had to do something.\" I explained that doing that was a VERY big deal to me because it's disrespectful to me and his wife, and me and my sister grew up being in the middle of EVERYTHING that went down between him and mom and I was very much done with that. \n\nHe did not apologize and just repeated his point. He believed what he did was OK and that he wouldn't necessarily avoid doing it in the future. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nReddit, I've gotta admit. I had never been so angry about anything in my life. The whole time I kept a neutral disposition and didn't let emotions get the better of me. That's no exaggeration. I was so mad that my whole body was shaking, i could barely squeak out any words because my lips were trapped shut in the angst, and I could feel all the blood rushing to my face. I was absolutely furious. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI expressed that I was mad and hurt because Dad jumped to awful assumptions about my wife without having any reason whatsoever to think that, and that I was pissed about the fact that he didn't seem to know what he was doing wrong, and talked in a condescending way. He half-ass \"apologized\" but didn't even mean it, and said that \"when I'm a dad\" I would agree with his choices and I just blurted out that ourkids will \\*NEVER\\* be in the middle of things, nor make the mistakes he did with with me and sis growing up. \n\nHe repeated the same rationale, and I told him that the conversation was over, as I was very mad and at risk of saying things that i would regret. Again, same condescending tone, \"ok, Jay\". I hung up and i felt like I jammed an adrenaline needle into my heart. \n\nThis absolutely pissed my wife's parents off, especially her dad. I told him that at some point we were going to work things out, but when I attempted to set up talks later on, he decided to let me try to initiate them and I was so done with Dad's behavior that I just wrote him off. Asking me to correct his problem was deeply frustrating, and the last straw.\n\nEver since then I've been struggling with things like not eating enough, buying pointless things, and isolating from other people. I just put two and two. My heart has been broken and I've been really jaded and vindictive, which is how I grieve.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHe made my wife look awful, he completely disregarded me and my opinions, and made excuses about everything.

Just 9 months later, his (and my) best friend who he had been living with also passes away. \nMy 18/19 yr old self grieved in the form of substance abuse and reckless behavior - coping is something I never learned how to do correctly until fairly recent and even still, I\u2019m not quite there yet.\n\nLast week, I find out my boyfriend of almost 6 years, who I thought I\u2019d marry, was in a coma in ICU and wouldn\u2019t make it. I am in so much shock and denial, it\u2019s completely surreal. He\u2019s such a part of me and my life. \nWe have been long distance a year as he went to treatment for 6 months out of state and then to a sober house (in state but still far) so I\u2019m used to not seeing him.

And as a side note, I am completely sober so I\u2019m not numbing or masking..the feels are all very much there.

I don\u2019t mean to come across as insensitive by any means, so please understand my intention is not to offend anyone or use this subreddit to get something out of anyone. We can all associate with grief, as we have all experienced it to some extent in our lives. On May 17, 2017 I lost my mother to a 5 year battle with cancer. My life will never be the same, and whether it\u2019s effected me positively or negatively, it\u2019s worth stating and reiterating that I have truly been changed for the rest of my life. Experiencing grief in this manner has opened my eyes to what grief really means to me and how it effects us as individuals and all the external factors that can play into how we process grief in our own way. I am seeking volunteers who would be willing to discuss their experience with grief with me in an interview setting.  I am not ready to announce to the public exactly what I will be doing with the interviews, but I\u2019d really like to start interviewing and if you contact me, I would give you more information and have a consent form for volunteers to look over before discussing anything with me.

She would often comment that it was like living in a college dorm but everyone is old and there's also nurses. Anyways, apparently my grandmother (we call her Gigi) has been hiding some cellulitis on her legs and some circulation problems, until Thursday when the nursing home called my mom and said they were taking her to the hospital. \n\nThat evening, my mom called me and told me that Gigi isn't doing so great and that she's talking about being \"ready to go\". My mom was sobbing on the phone. She's my grandmother's only daughter (my mom has 2 older brothers and a twin brother) so she often felt as though she had to take care of Gigi the most and they are pretty close. \n\nI know that this will be difficult for my mom, and I live 2 hours away but I want to be able to help her as much as I can through this process.

About 17 years ago now, when i was 3, my father passed away. I dont know how; i havent been able to get ahold of his death records, and every member of my family gives a different story/cause. Its very disorienting. I only have the vaguest memory, my only memory of him, and since i was so young im not even sure its real or if i dreamed it up/imagined how it happened, but its one of my most treasured memories anyway. \n\nAfter he died my mother went a little crazy. Took off with me and shacked up with one of his friends, who turned out to be an extremely abusive person. He kept us locked in his trailer in the middle of nowhere for the better part of a year, let his vicious dog tear up my things including the last gift id received from my dad, beat and took advantage of my mother and i, and tortured my dog to death. One of the only other relics from my time from before my dad died.\n\nIt only got worse. He ended up getting arrested and killed himself in jail. My mom's next boyfriend was fine at first, then started doing coke and who knows what else. Killed a betta fish that had also supposedly been with us since my dad died (i dont know if it actually was the original fish, but i thought it was and i LOVED that guy) by throwing it in its bowl out into our gravel driveway when my grandmother came to pick us up and drive us away from one of his rages. One time he put an axe through my moms car engine so we couldnt leave. I had a lot of cats; they all wound up missing. He would take them out back and shoot them/run them over as he saw fit, i later found out. He died when i was 7 in a drunken motorcycle accident.\n\nThrough all this i always went between resenting my dad for dying(some family tells me it was an overdose, and i obviously concluded none of this would have happened if he hadnt left so to speak) and resenting myself because i thought i must be a bad kid who deserved it. \n\nThere was a whole line of boyfriends my mom dated who ended up being losers. When she was single were the happiest times of my life, though every time a new one came in i would always get my hopes up, since they were usually nice at first. I never fully grasped what i was missing, i just knew i was missing something. Theres always been a hole in my chest that i want so desperately to fill. \n\nHowever i struggle with this immensely. I have a half brother through my dad; his mom was a meth-abusing narcissist who would rather have kept him drugged up on adhd meds he didnt need than raise her son. He was 10 when our dad died; he knew him better than i did, he had more time and memories with him. It kind of utterly destroyed him emotionally from what i can tell. Like me hes doing okay now, but... Honestly i dont think hes ever worked through it or fully recovered. I always knew i had a brother but as we had different mothers who werent fond of each other i rarely saw him; but i idolized him like he did our dad. I would stare at his picture and cry and wish and pray for him to show up one day to take me away from all the suffering around me. I thought maybe we could be like lilo and nani from lilo and stitch.\n\nI feel really guilty about this now, knowing he was only a kid too and had his own problems, the specifics of which are not mine to share. I feel like of anyone deserves to still be sad about the loss of our father though it really should be him. People dont understand why i still get upset about all this since its been so long now. And i guess i cant blame them. I just want to know what could have been. My dad was trying to get full custody of my brother before he died, and i just want to have that happy family living in my memory like all the other kids seemed to have.\n\nI really hate thinking about all this. It makes me feel small and lost in the world. I have a good support network now, but... Its hard to bring this up. No one understands. They either think im overreacting about my father being dead saying \"you dont even remember him why does it matter to you?\" Or they just cant comprehend the severity of it all once i tell them the chain of events that followed. \n\nI dont know why i felt compelled to type all this out now, and by all means if it breaks guidelines just let me know and ill remove it. I just feel guilty for still being upset about all this i guess, and this seemed like a decent sub to... Idk vent to? Seek advice at? Anyway if you made it this far you have my thanks.

She passed away in November and it tore my mother apart. With my brother passing only 8 months later it is truly a tragedy for our family that I am afraid we will not recover from. \n\nWe were a small family but we were a unit. We did everything we could for one another. My brother was the man of the house. He loved my mother so much he would cross the earth and back for her if she had asked. A truly wonderful son. \n\nHe was such a smart young man with so much potential. He graduated with his masters in December in mechanical engineering and had just started his dream jobs another state. He was one of the brightest people I knew. He rebuilt a car engine with his own two hands, and was able to fix absolutely anything you put in front of him. I was always envious that he could do these things and was so sure of what he wanted from what seemed like the moment he was born. He was truly a self starter. \n\nBeing an older sister I was always trying to be independent and make my own way. I wish I could take all those times back and have been a good big sister and friend to him. It wasn\u2019t until years later that I became his friend. I feel like we were still getting to know each other.  I felt like our roles were changing and that I was his younger sister. I began to try to impress him; I learned stick from him and I was always trying to tell him what new things I had learned or achieved with being able to drive it.  He once complimented me on my desire to learn that skill and my perseverance with it. I took that compliment very much to heart. \n\nI wish on Monday I could have had some foresight to tell him not to go.  He said it would only be a quick ride. I even noticed he was wearing all the appropriate safety gear, and I was internally happy that he was so responsible. \n\nIf I could I would lay down in his place. I feel like it should have been me to have this happen to and not him. The amount of potential that this kid had was astounding. I have never seen someone so good at everything they did.

Just a bunch of added bonus\u2019 more friends dead trying to keep my friend alive trying to keep my dad who died alive and trying to keep my mom alive.

That including most of all my soul mate who meant everything to me, was someone you cannot ever replace, who knew exactly what to say, do, feel to make me happy. Me making him happy him making me happy. Nothing\u2019s perfect but damn, he was damn close! \n\nBut he died. June 17 2016. Only 33.\n\nIt haunts me everyday.\n\nLike I said more tragedy followed. Dynamics changed not for the better, I\u2019ve lost my mind. Friendships I had for years have changed and not for the better. Many friends of mine are dead. I was raped by my \u201cfirst love\u201d weeks after my bf died. So much drama happened with everything everyone and plans were a joke. Knives in my back kept coming. I don\u2019t like saying poor me but it\u2019s a fucking cold world.\n\nI met this guy who\u2019s good looking and he\u2019s been spending a lot of time with me, and yeah it\u2019s been fun but now after like 6 long times of hanging out going out to dinner yes and sex, I feel so out of my element. It actually stressed me out. The first night he and I hung out it was at my long time best friends house and his dad flipped me and the guy I\u2019m seeing were looking for narcan at 5 am. Yeah by best friend and I are not on good terms. We went through so much and it\u2019s been brutal!\n\nSeeing my late boyfriends siblings all become parents, two of them he was alive for, and now there\u2019s more than 5. They all get to go home to their love. I don\u2019t. 3 years later and it kills me.\n\nThis new guy is kinda been a lot to take. He hides behind sarcasm and doesn\u2019t take compliments well. He seems to have some anger issues but he\u2019s not violent. I can\u2019t read him, but I\u2019m pretty sure he is using defenses. Idk. He and I haven\u2019t been in a relationship in a while, and I already feel a tug of war with his \u201cI\u2019m gunna he a jerk\u201d and now for a second \u201cI\u2019ll be nice\u201d. I know it\u2019s cute in the beginning but he doesn\u2019t open up and I think in the few weeks we\u2019ve been hanging out he\u2019s gotten a little too comfortable. I have been a prude you don\u2019t understand. But not quite with him...he and I aren\u2019t connecting on certain levels. Yes in some. I shouldn\u2019t expect much. But he\u2019s pretty harsh in his demeanor. He can be sweet, but texting went from excitement and kindness to the passive aggressive ones quickly. We cut eachother off. He mumbles and has a strong Boston accent so sometimes idk wtf he\u2019s saying and it\u2019s obnoxious. \u201cWhat?\u201d He gives up and gives me the nvm. I\u2019ve had a good time with him the first few times but it\u2019s been stressful on my heart physically. \n\nThing is, as corny as it sounds...with my late bf we grew closer always. We communicated. We made love and read each other\u2019s souls and minds. Our love was bigger than us. Nothing was obviously ever ideal, he had demons of his own that moved in before he knew me but....I loved how in sync we were and how kind he was. He was a gentleman. Once in a while when he said something hurtful it was actually a turn on. He was smooth. He was someone that was healthy for me. \n\nNow, there\u2019s no one who can top that.\n\nThis new Guy sure isn\u2019t anywhere close, I don\u2019t want to compare and I haven\u2019t really....but it\u2019s kind of hard not to.\n\nPrior to hanging out w this new dude I briefly went on dates. Nothing came out of it from my end for the most part because I was so not ready and broken. \n\nI\u2019m 32 now. I was 29 when my bf died. \n\nIt\u2019s painful.", "subreddit": "GriefSupport"}

It hit her extremely hard because after her mom passed, her crack addict father was given custody of her 3 younger sisters. The 3 girls experienced physical and emotional abuse up until they turned 18. My girlfriend is still dealing with all of this trauma and she copes in really unhealthy ways. She abuses alcohol, sometimes she will drink 2-3 bottles of wine in one night. After she\u2019s really drunk she starts lashing out and treating me like shit. She stopped showing up to school during our last semester, so even though she walked, she didn\u2019t actually graduate. She can\u2019t hold any job for longer than a few months. She doesn\u2019t even formally quit, she just stops showing up. When she does this it put me in a bad position financially because now I am forced to cover her portion of the bills. I try really hard to be there and be a great support but I am tired of this. I feel like I am being used as a punching bag. It feels like I have to always hold it together no matter what I\u2019m going through because she is liable to break down at any point. She is not stable in any way. Her finances are a disaster, she has let her debts go to collections, she\u2019s late on paying literally everything, and can\u2019t be trusted to do simple tasks. I work all day and get home to a dirty house, the dogs don\u2019t get fed, she just sleeps and drinks the day away. It\u2019s not fair because I\u2019ve lost 3 important people in my life this past year and it\u2019s like I\u2019m not allowed to grieve because she feels her loss was worse.

I'm still trying to live my life and go to work (I tutor) and spend time with people, but today I just spent time with myself. I left the apartment to run around the corner to get some things, but I otherwise stayed home and read, tidied my apartment, and cooked. Those things helped me. When I started sobbing while watching a TV show because it reminded me of my friend, I turned it off, cried, danced, and then I started journaling in the form of writing letters to my late friend. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI've also felt like I'm doing my best to act like nothing's wrong. It hit me today at the store that I had been standing there in the middle of an aisle, still, for what felt like several minutes. I keep feeling that way at various moments in the day--yesterday it hit me while on the tram. I put on a smile to the parents of my students so they don't know their child's tutor just lost someone she cared deeply about (I found out about my friend's death two hours before I had to go tutor). I had to try to act normal with my grandfather and his girlfriend yesterday because I brought it up and he said, \"Well, but that's life\" and laughed, which felt like he was laughing at me because of how sad I was when he arrived. Of course, bottling this up just means I start crying without notice and I don't know what triggers it. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt's also difficult because my friend had a rare bone cancer and I kept holding out hope he would get better, even though multiple oncologists were honest with him and told him they had no idea how to treat it. I wasn't there to be by his side and he was always there for me. He was the type of person who would drop everything to see you if you were in town. When a mutual friend of ours who was my boyfriend dumped me, he took my side and stayed loyal to me. When I lost a job, he immediately offered to connect me with people he knew in my industry. He was that type of person who always looked out for others. I sent him flowers and messaged him to check in on him, but I wasn't *physically* able to be there. On top of this guilt, there's feeling of anger towards the doctors for not doing more to save him, towards the people who fired me from my job where we both lived, which meant I had to move back in with my mom; towards the internet trolls who harassed both of us and convinced publications through rumors to take down articles encouraging donations to his GoFundMe. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm dealing with a lot of emotions and they honestly feel overwhelming. I'm lucky because my parents are being very understanding and supportive of me as I deal with my grief. My boyfriend has also been wonderful and offered to cancel plans we had and has come over just so I have someone to talk to, to rationalize my thoughts with, to hold me. I have a session with my therapist on Thursday, but I just feel like I have a lot I'm trying to deal with.

A couple hours later, I\u2019m about to go take her for a potty break and she\u2019s just laying there, tongue out, eyes blank, jaw slack, under her favorite comfy blanket on the couch. Her dead face will stay with me for a long, long time. \n\nI\u2019m just so confused and sad. I knew she was an old girl. All the signs of aging were there. Her sight was going, her hearing was going, her appetite, even her gait was beginning to stagger. She never used to need a leash outside, but these past couple weeks or maybe even the past month or so she\u2019s been really wanting to wander outside, like she was confused or scared. I never thought, however, that she\u2019d die already. It feels so sudden. I chalked up her confusion to our recent move, but I think I knew that wasn\u2019t truly it. She\u2019s moved with me a couple times. This was a sick Sky. \n\nI held her as my boyfriend drove us to the pet cremation place at around 11:30 pm. She was still slightly warm and limp at the start of driving, and by the time we got there she had already starting going stiff with rigor mortis. She was already dead when we started, but it felt like I was losing her even more the whole time. I couldn\u2019t bear looking at or touching her face. I should have at least closed her eyes but I didn\u2019t. I couldn\u2019t. Whenever I did catch a glimpse of her, she gave me a blank stare that drove a hole into my chest. With her mouth agape, I guess you could say she was smiling. That\u2019s how I want to see it in my head, anyway. \n\nI hope she was happy. I feel so much guilt. I know there\u2019s nothing I could\u2019ve done. I know it was just her time to go, but I can\u2019t help but feel an incredible guilt. All the times I got mad at her for peeing on the floor or howling, I feel so incredibly awful and guilty. I\u2019m glad I had a positive final interaction with her, but I really want to feel her sleeping next to me again. She loved when I\u2019d put my hands under the blankets and move them around and watch her \u201cattack\u201d them. We did that together earlier today. I\u2019ll never forget her.

Oddly enough, my friend that overdosed was raised directly nextdoor to my grandmother's. His family is just devastated and I just feel so bad. And at the same time, I feel bad because I'm not reacting like how I would expect me too. Lol its almost like I'm broken. I haven't had a regular dream in God knows how long.

Most people - at least the normal ones - look forward to celebrating the day with loved ones. I, on the other hand, was avoiding everyone like the plague. I needed time, and space, and some quiet. Actually, a lot of quiet. \n\nOf all my birthdays when I have avoided people, this day was the most contemplative one. For the past several months, I have experienced what can only be termed existential anguish. Credit to my brother dying so suddenly and dramatically, that I have been pondering over my existence (and his non-existence) ever since. Today was the day, I felt I would get some answers.\n\nEver since my brother's death, I have repeatedly asked myself (and others around me) the same question, although in different ways. Each time I passed through a stage of grief (although in not the particular order psychology tells us), I asked the question differently. \n\nWhen I was angry that my brother - who neither drove a car nor rode a bike, who never boarded crowded buses or metros, who didn't run to catch a bus or cross a road - died in a freak road accident, I asked myself why those people are still alive who drive on the wrong side of the road, or make a sudden cut or don't wear a helmet, while my brother was dead. When I was sad that my brother died so young despite being such a good person, I asked how so many criminals and wrongdoers live long while my brother was already dead. When I was \"bargaining\", I asked why I was alive when I don't know my purpose in life, while he was dead even though he had a bright future, a new life partner and a future of endless possibilities. \n\nSo, I contemplated today, as to what exactly is the reason I am alive at 34 while my brother died at 29. What exactly is the purpose of my life? What is the reason for my existence?\n\nIt hasn't come to me yet. I realize existential questions don't get answered so simply or quickly. But I have understood something about my existence - I don't have to feel guilty to be alive while my brother is dead, even though he deserved to be here more than I do.", "subreddit": "GriefSupport"}

I started coming into her room more, probably around the 2nd month.  I've slept in here a few nights when I was really missing her, and just wanted to be sad and cry.  About a half a month ago, we moved some things around, one being her computer desk.  We took that down, and put my sofa from my room in here to create a 'separate space' for me and my boyfriend.  I kept her computer in her room and on, and just put it on a smaller, mobile desk.  Now, I'll come in here a lot more often to write my blogs, or play games, or just to relax and watch tv in a room other than my own.  The being in here part has definitely gotten better, but I definitely still think about her all of the time it feels like.  I find comfort being in here, but also sadness.  I guess, that's just par for the course.  I've been more depressed lately, so I haven't been in here too much (hence, not many blogs the past couple of days), but I still try I suppose.  This is one of those gray areas so to speak.  The place she would always be sitting is diagonal from where I'm sitting right now, so I have, of course, the perfect view.  I definitely will start to look up and hope that she's sitting there.  So, that part sucks.  I haven't changed anything else in her room yet, aside from turning her tv, and some stuff being put on her bed from taking the computer desk out.  I'm still not ready.  I feel my Dad pushing, and it's not a comfortable feeling.  There's no use trying to explain this to him, as I already have tried many times, and failed.  Better to just grieve by myself and hope that he doesn't ask me for the 50 millionth time (okay, slight exaggeration, but man!) if I'm \"okay\".  NO. NO. NO!!! No, I am not okay!  I appreciate that he wants me to be okay, but he just needs to accept (as I have) the fact that right now, and probably for a while longer, I'm not going to be okay.  I might have okay days, where I can smile, laugh, and not feel like crying every 2 seconds, but no, I am not okay.  I'm just existing with the reality that is mine.

I am doing my best to be there to talk to etc but I can obviously only help so much.  I suggested trying to talk to other people who have been through similar things but she is very reluctant to reach out, for various reasons that I'm sure many of you will have also experienced.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, I am starting to look around and try to find some sort of information or direction and maybe find some people for her to speak to, even if it is just over email or letters (she likes writing letters) but I have no idea where to look.  Reddit has been a helpful place to many in the past, so I thought I'd ask in here if there are any people who have been through such a tragedy and somehow managed to build some sort of life back up and find a reason to go on.  I am interested in hearing about people's experiences with any and all ways that they have found to keep themselves going and I'm hoping that I might be able to help her find something that will make some sort of difference to her, even if it is in small ways.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThanks\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nJoe", "subreddit": "GriefSupport"}

No matter how calm and controlled they seemingly may be, no one can understand such circumstances be normal. Their disturbed circulation makes them cold, their distress makes them unstrung, sleepless. Persons they normally like, they often turn from. No one should ever be forced upon those in grief, and all over-emotional people, no matter how near or dear, should be barred absolutely. Although the knowledge that their friends love them and sorrow for them is a great solace, the nearest afflicted must be protected from any one or anything which is likely to overstrain nerves already at the threatening point, and none have the right to feel hurt if they are told they can neither be used or be received. At such a time, to some people companionship is a comfort, others shrink from their dearest friends.\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis is an excerpt from \"The Year of Magical Thinking\" by Joan Didion who references this passage from \"Etiquette\" by Emily Post.

It made me realize that there is no wrong or right way to act/feel/look during my time of grief. I've had relatives become upset because I won't answer/return their calls and it gives me even more anxiety than I already feel. I come to work and go on auto pilot to get through the day. I put make up on and do my hair so that people can think I'm doing ok; so that they can stop asking how I'm doing and just assume \"I'm better\", as if I was getting over a fucking cold. Otherwise I break and I know that will make them uncomfortable. My life is shattered. I have suffered the biggest loss of my life, and pardon me if my mourning makes you uncomfortable. Forgive me, if you invite me somewhere with people outside of my current comfort circle (fiance, dad and sisters), and I decline and it makes you feel inadequate because you're just \"trying to help\" but NO! I do not need to get out and walk and get some fresh air or go out so I can \"distract myself\". My fucking pain will be the same in my home or at fucking Disneyland! She will be in every though.

I was in about fifth grade at the time.\n\nIn the group home, I met a girl. I can't disclose her name for safety reasons, but we'll call her A.\n\nShe couldn't talk, couldn't move, and had just about everything wrong with her. But she brought life and happiness and a spark of joy to everyone around her. I could tell her anything and everything, and it felt like she could talk to you and give you advice just through her eyes. It was amazing.\n\nShe got sick in about my sixth grade year. None of us could tell it was coming, and my parents just came in to school and told me, \"A is in the hospital, they don't think she's going to make it through the night.\"\n\nNow, this is about a year after I've been working with her, changing her diapers, talking to her, bringing her places, cooking her meals. She was kinda like my daughter.\n\nI was devastated.\n\nShe made it through the night.\n\nNot only did she make it through the night, she made it through the next seven months in the hospital. I sat with her and held her hand as they literally **tw: blood** suctioned blood out of her throat while she cried.\n\nThe doctors told us multiple times that it was the end, it would take a miracle to save her, etc. She always prevailed. Later, they moved her to hospice care in a group home for the elderly.\n\nShe lasted until two days before her 14th birthday, and I'm pretty sure I was the last person out of the home she worked in to talk to her.\n\nI had told her that when I got married in ten years or so she could be my bridesmaid.\n\nI'm pretty sure that was the last thing I said to her.\n\nI remember, a year ago, when they brought us in to say goodbye back when they thought she was going to die. I told her multiple things, one of which I was gay (this is one thing I still think about, she was a devout Catholic and I have no idea if she accepted me. it's not about me, i just wanted her to be proud) and that if she decided to go I wouldn't be mad.\n\nThat all still hold up a year later, and I hope she knows that.\n\nI cried at the funeral, but I didn't cry all that much otherwise. I was numb for months, I didn't know how to deal with it.\n\nAnd then, my dad and I were arguing, and he said something about her that went too far.\n\nI *snapped*.\n\nI had a full on mental meltdown, panic attack and all, shaking and sobbing and screaming and all that shit. I didn't know I was in that much pain until then.

He would dress like them, take pics as them and he would try to talk to women but they would reject him because of how he acted. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMind you, he had no friends, I was the only person outside of his mom and a couple of cousins that would talk to him.

If someone called him out on it, he would get mad and black them. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHe claimed to have narcolepsy and would post fake pics online of blood in sinks and such with the watermark from the site still on them and claim that was a real pic from his house after he had fainted. He would say that his ex showed up and shot him through the hand and would send a fake pic of a hand with a bullet hole through it. He would then send a pic of his own hand wrapped in an old Ace bandage and claim that he was going to take \"alkaseltzer for the pain\" and go to bed. He would send me voice clips of him screaming talking about how bad it hurt and all this. Every few months he would randomly say that he knew none of the characters he posed as was real but that he liked being a kid and playing. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt went from 2011 till this year of him going from being depressed about his wife leaving him for another woman to stories of non existent family feuds. My ex never went around him again, but he claimed one night that she came up and told a lie about me and that he punched her for me because I was \"his family\". He was always say \"I love you bro\" to me and tell me that I was his only friend and brother. This isn't even the tip of the iceberg of how these stories played out in length and how much he put into them. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo fast forward to Friday July 5th. He sends me a message late in the night stating that he is mad at his family for stealing money from his disability checks. He then sends a pic of a hat and whip and states that he bought it to make himself feel better while watching Indiana Jones movies. When I woke up in the morning I sent him a message stating \"awesome!\". I didn't hear anything back but it was normal for him to go a few days without talking from time to time. Then Monday it showed he seen my message at 6am.  Note that on that previous Saturday he had posted some messages on his wall about not believing in people anymore and things like that, but he would go through those spells of doing that or ranting about his ex on his wall. At 8 pm that night he posted an update on a game he was playing on PS4. Then nothing. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTuesday and Wednesday goes by with nothing. Thursday I had a training to go to, so I was in it all day. So I get home that evening and go to bed. At about 11 that night I get a message from a friend asking if I knew this person. I said yes. Then she proceeds to ask if it is true that he passed away. My first thought was, here we go he's told someone else one of these stories. I got to his page. Nothing. I go to all his families pages and am not finding anything. Then I get to his mom, 1 of his cousins and 1 of his aunts pages and there it is. R.I.P.! I shot up out of bed in a shocked panic. I messaged the cousin right away. She came back and said that Tuesday his mom had found him dead and that they suspected it was a heart attack. I went cold and numb. This couldn't be true! I looked and couldn't find anything at all resembling an obituary or anything. Then I was told that due to such a small, small amount of people even knowing him they just had a tiny get together of immediate family in the area on Thursday, then had him cremated. Today his obituary came up online. There was no work put into it at all, it was barely a sentence and no pics. Every other one around his had a pic and a long narrative. His was so bare. My friend only knew what happened because her sister used to date him. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLong story short, with only 3 people publicly stating that he was gone, there was nothing. I would have never found out and would have just thought that he stopped using social media if not for my friend. I have felt numb and have grieved all day. He was laughed at by most due to his appearance and the way he acted. I know I wasn't the friend I should have been at all. Now I'm here feeling empty and tortured and so very, very confused. He was 40.", "subreddit": "GriefSupport"}

A couple months ago my older brother died of chronic illness, we saw it coming but the end happened so quickly that he died while I was on the plane trying to get to him. He had several kids all still not adults, and he had never really been a dad to any of them. I helped raise one of the kids as a baby, and my partner and I had been approached about adopting another child and we agreed, but my brother and the baby's grandma backed out when they realized we weren't willing to quit our jobs and move back to their state. My brother lost custody of his other children, and I think our mom saw this last child as a chance to do better... So she cared for my nephew and my brother, raising a child and trying to keep my brother alive. I guess I should also say that this health condition did not have to be fatal. Many people live mostly normal lives, they just have to take care of themselves. My brother did not take care of himself at all, didn't follow doctor advice for decades, and died in exactly the manner he'd been warned about if he kept ignoring his health. I also have a vague but nagging suspicion that my brother may have been involved in or allowed one of his kids to be molested; this kid skipped her dad's funeral. There's definitely a history of molestation involving him and another child. My brother was definitely a neglectful parent and really should not have had kids at all. When I got there after his death I found his room a complete disaster and spent 4 days cleaning it, dead mice and all.\n\nSo... Lately I keep thinking about him. I think about how his kids now have a dead father they probably still hate. How one of those kids could have grown up in our home happy, cared for, but instead grew up watching his father kill himself slowly. I am angry that he was so lazy and stupid about his health. I don't know how to align what I know about his terrible behavior with the fact he always acted like a funny, nice dude. Whenever I interacted with him he just seemed like a lovable loser, yah know? Sometimes I see him for a split second in my house and have to do a double take. I don't know if I hate him or pity him, if I am scared of remembering him or just don't want to. We were never close, and I've tried reaching out to his kids but we are so so far away and I have basically no contact with anyone in my family at this point. I don't know if I need to try to stop thinking about him, or just give in and think and talk about him until I've exhausted my brain. \n\nSorry that this is so long and rambling.

Some of those losses are more profound than others. These profound losses tend to open up our lives to those who take advantage of others.\n\nWhether intentional or unintentional our energy during the process of grieving will attract people and situations that have a negative impact. Statistically there are over 1 million people in the widowed in the United States each year. Out of those million the majority are women. Most with their greatest protectors gone and emotionally broken. \n\n#1 Secure any and all funding!!!\n#2 No matter how broken-don\u2019t get emotionally involved just because you feel alone. \n#3 No matter family or friends-do your best to listen to your own intuition and not advice from others.\n#4 Seek out a therapist, coach or counselor.\n#5 Set up a Self-Love routine for yourself.\n\nStep 1 to secure your finances is your first priority. Even if you have the best family and friends, during this time people will either blatantly ask for loans and cash/or nickel and dime you. Secure your funds until you are of sound mind again and can rationally know what financial paths you need to take long term. \n\nStep 2 is no matter how lonely you get, don\u2019t get involved in sexual or emotional relationships with others. People may think they are doing you a favor or that they really do care for you, but a break up when your emotions are so raw is a thousand times worse. Be on solid ground before you try and get involved with other people. Step 5 will help with this step tremendously. \n\nStep 3 is to get in tune with your own intuition and quick. It will be the hardest thing you have to do but do it. Everyone will be attempting to give you advice on everything from taking trips to selling your home. Don\u2019t listen to any advice and don\u2019t make any decisions that you don\u2019t have to make for at least a year. Some people and some situations will cause you to have no choice. If this is the case, keep these decisions to a minimum. \n\nStep 4 is to seek the advice of a therapist, Coach, or counselor. Someone who is neutral to your situation and someone who specializes in grief specific issues. I think groups are fine but from experience, the coffee and donut meeting route will not be enough. We have been inundated with false beliefs regarding grief from childhood. If you find someone good in your area, this will be the best thing you can do for yourself. \n\nStep 5 is to focus on self healing. This includes massage and various types of energy healing modalities. Yoga classes, meditation or any type of class to get you in touch with your inner emotions is very helpful. Hire a maid, call out for your groceries, or purchase meals from a meal prep service and if you have children arrange to have regular sitter times to allow for your self healing. This is the only way you can be available to help them during their healing process. Remember how you teach your children to heal during grief will set the tone for loss the rest of their lives. \n\nIf you have a truly significant loss healing yourself should be your #1 priority and it will not be easy. Helping yourself become as strong as possible during the process will only better your odds of coming out of a loss in a positive direction. \n\nGood luck on your journey. Remember to always be kind to yourself and practice self love. There is no time limit on grief. Be patient with yourself.

I got a new job which has been because it's helping establish independence. So life is going. There are good things happening.\n\nBut, I'm still sad sometimes. It's not like before though. It feels like absolute agony some days. Like I've got a big hole in my chest. I just want to see my dad, be in his presence, hear his voice. I had a dream that kind of stirred all this up. In the dream I was a little girl &amp; there was some gathering or event happening at my house. I wanted my dad to be there so badly. It was like I had forgotten that he had passed. I called his phone, I asked my mom \"you think Dad is doing okay? You think he'll stop by?\" In my dream my mom just kind of stared at me. blankly. After that I woke up crying.

My grandma (my mom's mom) is in her 80s, and has been doing quite well considering (but she hasn't seemed all there for a while and has not been the same since my grandpa died about 10 years ago) but she was pretty healthy and mobile, traveling internationally a bunch and doing bucket list stuff, etc.. (I'm 24, in case that's relevant).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThen within 6 months of each other, my mom was diagnosed with breast cancer and my grandma was diagnosed with brain cancer. My grandma was given 3-6 months to live and no treatment options, while my mom led everyone (including me and my dad) to believe (and perhaps hopefully somehow really believed herself) that she had a good prognosis and was early stage breast cancer. She was on chemo and radiation and awaiting the right time for surgery.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe're scattered across the county currently, but a couple months ago, my mom and I both arranged to fly at the same time to visit my grandma and also see each other-- thinking that possibly it was the last time we were going to be able to see my grandma. My grandma is receiving hospice care in her home- but seemed like she was barely hanging on at that time. My mom and I both cried as we left her house that day.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy mom suddenly took a turn for the worse a couple weeks ago. Turns out, she's been stage 4 metastatic breast cancer since initial diagnosis a year ago and hid it from everyone. I don't know why and probably never will- my dad found her medical records hidden in their closest after she died.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe was deemed healthy enough for chemo one day and then less than 24 hours later went into organ failure and was rushed to the ER. I got on a flight and made it there in time to hold her hand while she died, but she was already so delirious and on a ventilator by the time I arrived, we didn't get to say goodbye to each other. It was such a horrible night, as every day since has been.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnyway, my grandma has gotten worse and worse since the brain cancer diagnosis. For that reason, my mom's siblings, who are taking care of my grandma day to day in addition to the nursing staff, decided not to tell grandma that mom died. They thought since she was so close (like days away) from dying, they didn't want to make her suffer any more than necessary. I was so in shock and beyond processing anything in the initial days after my mom died that I didn't object- I figured since they are the ones with her every day, it should be their choice because they know her mental state best.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBut now, my grandma has surpassed the time she was given- it's now been 8 months since she was diagnosed with brain cancer and given 3-6 mo to live. She and my mom were pretty close- my mom called her a lot since her diagnosis- in fact, my mom is the only person whose calls my grandma would take. I also was quite close with my grandma too- we have traveled together and write each other regularly. I do not look forward to my grandma dying, but I now am afraid she will live long enough to either find out the truth and be both devastated and hurt by the lie, or not find out but feel abandoned by my mom since she obviously will never hear from her again.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI am very conflicted. I don't want her to suffer from the pain of her youngest child dying before her. But it's such a huge lie. And I am now complicit in it- I wrote her a letter (as I do every few weeks) and did not mention anything about mom dying. My uncle is screening her letters and phone calls to make sure she doesn't find out, so I guess I don't really have an option to tell her-- I have at this point voiced my concerns to my uncles--  so maybe this is just a vent. Is this the wrong thing to do? Would you do the same?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEdit: Typo\n\nEdit: Clarity", "subreddit": "GriefSupport"}

There are so many things I lived through with an alcoholic mom, the calls to police, cleaning up her throw-up, etc, watching her hallucinate from withdrawal, having to have her forcibly admitted a number of times to the hospital for her addiction....\n\nBut I digress.\nGrief is hard enough, but I never really had her when she was alive. She was always somewhere else, figuratively, even on her good days.\n\nToday I am frustrated.. Frustrated at how many people don't understand the perspective of the things i've seen and had to push through. Frustrated that I have to explain the constant battle of moods I sift through healing from my childhood just to be able to function at work and in relationships. Frustrated at how little my milestones mean when I think i've come so damn far.\n\nand god damnit, I still would not wish any of it on anyone else. Because I live through the second hand damage every day. And even after it all, I'm the one expected to make adjustments in my life to make other people feel comfortable because they don't understand those deep and difficult emotions and experiences.\n\nSo today, I am frustrated. Frustrated at grief, at trauma, at our lack of resources for addiction, frustrated at a lack of empathy and understanding.\n\nI know these feelings will pass, but right now, i'm frustrated.\n\nI guess I just needed to vent.

After divorce my father tryed to make some business in construction and my mom always had her shops. Last time I saw my father was 2014. It was a good time in Karelian forest. I remember how he catched a lot of pikes in lake... He gave me his knife as a present. Year before it I immigrated to France from Russia. Since then there was no any contact with him. Last year I decided to take away his parent rights on me because he could file me for money support when he got old. He didn't even came to court. Through the years he became a stranger for me. Can't deny that even after all his denial of me he made a huge impact on me. He introduced me into engeneering. So, as I know, my dad died few weeks ago from cancer. He always was afraid of doctors and postponed surgery to remove the tumor... He died in Finland. He has moved his new family there before his death. I used to think he forgot about me, but I found his page on russian social network and I found out that he was actually proud of me. He posted my photo with him when I was a kid and my profile image and wrote: \"like two drops of water\". I wish I could talk to him. Rest in peace, dad.", "subreddit": "GriefSupport"}

I read so many stories of sorrow while sitting on the toilet sobbing the morning he died. It gave me comfort to hear your stories, so thank you for that. I wanted to share mine but I wasn't ready yet, I'm pretty shy, but I guess I will now. :)\n\nI would've never thought that at 19, I'd already be without my Papa. He was diagnosed with the most aggressive form of brain cancer 3 years ago. I grew up in Africa and we were on vacation in the US, we were set to leave in two days to go back home when we found out the news. I never got to say goodbye to my friends or get my stuffed animals. He was given 6 months to live with treatment and only a few weeks without. It was quite a shock, but my family was okay and we were ready to battle the cancer with him. To think that he lasted 3 years just blows my mind, I was so blessed to have all that precious time with him. \n\nDon't get me wrong though, the past 3 years have been hell. I watched his memory and mind deteriorate along with his independence and strength. But I had never loved him more, even though his body was falling apart before him he was so strong and joyful. I've never met someone so brave and kind. \n\nThe last year, I had become one of his primary caregivers so that my mom could work a job part time. It was weird to be so young and have to help change his diapers, feed him, clothe him, bathe him, etc. But it was joy to help him.\n\nThe last week of his life was so painful, he couldn't comunicate anymore, he stopped eating and drinking, he was dehydrated. It was so hard to see him suffer and hear my Mom constantly on the phone with Hospice and to be told there was nothing we could do. He died around 3 AM holding hands with my mom and I. I don't know what it was but that night  I told myself I wasn't going to sleep and I was going to be next to him the whole night. I sat there for 7 hours never leaving to eat or drink or go to the bathroom. I can still remember watching his heart rate and oxygen drop and watching his chest slowly stop moving until it just never lifted again and then hearing my Mom break into whailing. I had never felt so much pain. I was hesitant to turn off his oxygen machine because I wanted to believe he still needed it. \n\nIt was an hour until the hospice nurse was able to get to our house and officially pronounce him dead. When he put the stethoscope on Papa's chest, I hoped so badly that there would be a heartbeat even though I knew he was already gone and his hands were so cold. After he died, I kept holding his hand for two hours just sobbing. He didn't really look dead yet, more like he was just sleeping. It does give me so much comfort to know he doesn't have to live with the shackles of cancer. I watched him suffer for years and fight to live for so long and my family was ready for him to go Home and I think he was too. He was tired of living, I think he stayed alive for so long because he didn't want to leave his three girls (meaning my mom, my little sister, and I). We were his pride and joy and he would always talk about how proud he was of us (which I honestly don't get sometimes, I don't think I'm that much to be proud of). \n\nHis memorial was incredible, the room (which was big) was full to the brim and there were no where close to enough seats to fit everyone. There was an open mic and so many people came up and told funny stories or talking about how amazing he was. One kid even wrote a song for my Dad and it was amazing!!! \n\nUgh, I think it hurts so much more just because of how incredible Papa was. I miss him so much. I genuinely think he was the person I loved most on this Earth and I don't want to continue my life without him. I keep praying that I'll have a short life so I won't have to wait so long before I can see him again. I don't know how to go on living (don't worry, I'm not suicidal). \n\nI don't fully know why I'm writing this but at least it's helping me work though how I'm feeling.", "subreddit": "GriefSupport"}

It is only when we feel intense pain that we are willing to look at our values and question WHY they seem to be failing us.\n\nWe need some sort of existential crisis to take an objective look at how we have been deriving meaning in our life, and then consider a change in course.\n\nYou could call it hitting rock bottom bottom, or having an existential crisis. I prefer to call it \u201cWeathering the Shit Storm.\u201d\n\nChoose what suits you.\n\nPerhaps you\u2019re in that kind of place right now.\n\nPerhaps you are coming out of the most significant challenge of your life, and are bewildered because everything you previously thought to be true and normal and good has turned out to be the opposite.\n\nThat\u2019s good.\n\nThat\u2019s the beginning.\n\nI can\u2019t stress this enough.\n\n**Pain is part of the process.** \n\nIt\u2019s important to feel.\n\nBecause if you just chase after highs to cover up the pain, if you continue to indulge in entitlement and delusional positive thinking, if you continue to over indulge in various substances or activities than you will never generate the requisite motivation to actually change.\u201d\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhat I have above is an excerpt from \u201cThe Subtle Art of Not Giving a F\\*ck\u201d. They are not my own words, but they had a big impact on me (not at first but eventually). I first heard them when the book came out the end of 2016. I was newly married, just moved into a house, had one great dog with thoughts on getting a second, a good job with great people around me, almost perfect health and a full and complete loving family. Turns out the words meant shit to me. I thought I understood them at the time and got something profound out if it, then promptly forgot them \u2013 so they couldn\u2019t have had that much of an impact on me.\n\nThen, my brother died.\n\nThat was easily the worst day of my life, I felt terrible. I felt like a bad brother, a bad son, a bad husband. I felt I should have reached out more, should have helped him get better. If I screwed it up with my brother, the person you are *supposed* to be closest with, I felt I was failing at all other relationships in my life. Eventually I recovered and \u201cmoved on\u201d. But recently these words came back and I re-evaluated my emotional state, and I think it has shaped my choices for the last 18 months. I looked at my values, or more importantly, the yardstick I use to measure how well I am keeping up with my values. I was miserable because I *felt* like a bad brother. Why didn\u2019t I *feel* close to him or the rest of my family? Because we didn\u2019t talk enough. According to what? Society tells me brothers have to be close. Why is closeness defined with phone calls? Turns out it\u2019s not. I loved him very much (still do), I love my wife very much, I love my daughter very much, I love my friends very much. I am close with them because I care about them, because we have mutual respect and admiration. My call history can\u2019t measure closeness or love, so why was I trying to use it?\n\nWhat I am trying to say is that I *felt* like a bad person and I spent a lot of time avoiding thinking about it for the obvious reason that it made me feel even worse to \u201cknow\u201d I was a bad person, then I would feel even worse still because I know that I know I am bad person but I still don\u2019t do anything to fix it \u2013 a feedback loop of hell (another idea from the book). I pretended to be OK, I pretended to have dealt with his death in a way that was delusional, pretending to be on some spiritual high ground where \u201cdeath shouldn\u2019t be sad because we all die.\u201d All that was to avoid those feelings of pain. \n\nThen I heard again *\u201cpain is part of the process\u201d*. So I evaluated myself, and quickly got really fucking sad and angry. But then thought about why and realized it was bullshit. I had to bail on the delusion thoughts \u201cI am OK\u201d and \u201cI am over it\u201d because I wasn\u2019t. I also had to bail on the idea that I am a failure. If I stayed on the self-denial path I don\u2019t think I would have made the conscious efforts to review all my values and yard sticks. Now my values are clear, I value being a good friend and family member, and measure that not by the phone calls but by my support when they need it, my criticism when they need that and my silence when necessary. I value being a leader and influencing people in a positive way and I measure that by the success and growth of those around me. I value compassion, measured by the connections I make with people and helping as much as I can but also realizing there are many situations where all I can do is shut the fuck up and listen. All of these values I have always had, but I measured them by phone calls and texts, by promotions and monetary raises, by how many people I could \u201ctalk off the cliff\u201d and having advice for every situation, even ones I have never experienced. I was egocentric, my success in life was measured by shitty yardsticks that were out of my control and only made me feel good, and put me in a better place. The final outcome for the other people was not considered.\n\nDoing this didn\u2019t make me suddenly happy. It still hurt then and does to this day. But now it hurts in a real way, in a better way. I am not always sad of course, but when I am it is because I miss him. Not because I regret our time together or the lack there of, not because I *feel* like I was inadequate and at fault, just because he is gone. Life sucks sometimes, and problems will never be totally out of our lives. But by looking at your values and how you measure your success, you can trade in old problems (being angry at myself for *feeling* like a bad brother) for new, \u201cbetter\u201d problems (sadness at the loss of a loved one that was out of control and finding a way to make him proud.) It can take you from a place of inaction and emotional stagnation based on fear of how you will feel, to a place of motivation and inspiration. Emotions are evolutionarily important, they are a signal to us that something needs to be changed, they are a call to action. You just to find out what the right action is, and do it.", "subreddit": "GriefSupport"}

I knew he was sick. He had been in the hospital for a bit, but the way my mom described it on the phone while I was away made it sound like he was getting better. My heart is just so broken because the *morning* I was going to go and see him, my mom came home with my aunt and they told me my uncle had died earlier that morning. I feel regret for not having gone beforehand. There was also time when I got back, but as soon as I came home, I was already feeling blue because I immediately started missing my fianc\u00e9, and on top of that I was thrust right into the winding down of my mom's divorce from my father who has been a terrible person all of my life and treated her and my family very poorly in various ways. I was sucked up in that anger, seeing the pain that my mom is in and continues to be in even though the divorce is over, but she's losing a lot of her goddamn pension to this evil person. My father continues to text and email her insanely mean and disgusting things on a weekly basis. I've watched her age physically in a short timespan over this.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEverything just *hurts*. I was looking at some photos of my uncle visiting my cousin and her family in Sweden a while ago and even though the photos are great and they were having such a good time, my heart broke all over again. I keep crying at random, especially since the funeral last Friday. I never knew the type of pain that comes with watching loved ones lose loved ones because this is really the first person I've lost that I ever cared for very deeply.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNothing seems to really give me pleasure lately. I've been depressed before, so I'm sure that's what it is. I wish it would go away. I don't feel like doing anything, but I keep forcing myself to keep going to the gym, do things in the house, work on my thesis. Regardless I'm just in so much pain emotionally. I know for sure that the wrong person in my life died. It should have been my father. My uncle was better to my family than my dad was. It really sucks.", "subreddit": "GriefSupport"}

I hung up, called back and immediately got through. \n\n\nThis morning it occurred to me, during the 20 min I was on hold, they kept playing ads. One was for a Grief Support Group. I immediately felt a sense of peace wash over me I hadn\u2019t felt in forever. \n\n\nI didn\u2019t take the number down so I called the clinic and convinced the operator to put me on hold until I heard it again and could write down the place/dates/times/contact info.

She was young, in her 50s. Ever since, I\u2019ve been extremely stressed about my dad. On top of that, I\u2019m still grieving deeply about losing my mom so young (I\u2019m in my 20s and we were very close) and going through a lot of life changes (career, relationships). It\u2019s been an extremely stressful couple years. I\u2019ve gotten to the point where I don\u2019t cry on public transportation everyday, but I do feel a dull aching grief multiple times a day. \n\nA little background on my parents:\nMy mom was the rock of our family. She was the organizer and disciplinarian. She kept everyone in line, especially my dad (who is basically a 60 year old teenager). She was also incredibly thoughtful, loving, strong and supportive. \n\nSince she\u2019s passed, he\u2019s gone through many different phases of grief. He drank for months, to the point that his doctor told him to stop. He\u2019s travelled the world. He\u2019s basically dated every woman over 45 in our city. He\u2019s incapable of being alone, which I understand. It almost makes me feel better that he\u2019s out all the time, not isolating himself. He\u2019s a very friendly and loving person, so he easily meets new people.\n\nBut I worry about him all. the. time. It eats at me. I lived with him for about a year after she passed. I recently moved out to be with my significant other (which adds guilt on top of worry). I see him regularly, but recently went back to his apartment and it\u2019s getting into hoarding territory. Not like terrible, but just random junk all over the place. His father did something similar after his mom passed. It\u2019s almost as if he\u2019s reverted to how he was before he met my mom. He\u2019s like a 25 year old dude that doesn\u2019t know how to take care of himself. \n\nI don\u2019t know if there\u2019s anything I can or should do. I told him he should hire somebody to help him tidy up. I personally am a neat freak and the slightest mess stresses me out. That more stuff will pile up and get out of control. Am I worrying over nothing? Am I just neat and being too critical? Is he just doing his thing and I need to chill? Has anybody else had a similar experience?\n\nAnyways, there\u2019s my emotional vomit. Idk if I\u2019m even asking a question. Just needed to get it off my chest. My mom passed away 2 years ago Sunday and it\u2019s brought a lot of pain to the surface. \n\nStay strong everyone!!! &lt;3", "subreddit": "GriefSupport"}

He had a nearly fatal overdose on New year's Eve the previous winter. I miss him in a way I didn't think I would. He was always stubborn and even a little mean. But that was part of his charm. I started skating because I saw him do a powerslide in front of a group of our classmates. I hadn't ever seen somebody good at skateboarding in person and I knew I wanted to do it. It's been 10 years since then and I love skating more than the world. Now more than ever because he's not here to skate anymore. He's not here to live it up, so I have to do it for him. I hope that there's an afterlife and he can live vicariously through me. I just wish he was here to help me. I could say anything to him and he wouldn't be shaken. He knew I was just messed up and he was messed up too. I wish he had been able to stay with us, even if he never got clean. I don't know if there's an afterlife but I know if there is then he's looking at me and trying to push me.\nThe following month of November, my Nana passed as well. She was sick for a while. She would speak to me on the phone and I could tell she was getting weak, and she would say things that made me think she was depressed. I don't know how to make up for what she did for me in my lifetime aside from living as long as my body can take me. I loved my Nana and I knew she was going. The last interaction we had was when she woke up from her deep slumber at the hospital, I asked if she was hungry, and she said yes, she said she wanted chicken. She got her chicken and nibbled a bit, but was asleep shortly after. I spoke to her while she was asleep and apologized for being a such a brat when I was a kid. For screwing around and not going to college. I don't know how to feel. I knew she was going for at least a year. She would get a little better and then it would continue to get worse, so I sort of came to terms with what was going to happen. It was still very sad to see her in bed basically unconscious, but she seemed comfortable. She had us there to see her off. She didn't die alone. I love my Nana and I'd love to have her see me get my degree, but I waited too long. My siblings are okay. My brother has a fiance and a steady job with my mom, and my sister is ivy league material. But I was an addict, a degenerate, and suicidal. I don't know if she felt like I would be okay. I wish I would have gotten my shit together in time for her to be sure. As I said about Jonathan idk if there is an afterlife but I hope there is so that she can know her grandson is going to succeed. My mental condition is no better, but I'm trying so hard. I'm trying so hard for them both.\nIn December I lost my first rat Lua. She was a chunky albino rat with red eyes and all. She had 4 tumors, one under each limb, that got so big she couldn't really get around anymore. I would set up a bride from her open cage to my bed at night. On Christmas morning I woke up to her dead on my bed. her eyes were closed, I can only hope she went in her sleep. I had adopted her and her cage-mate from a very special person in my life. They were good rats, very friendly and well behaved. I had never watched a living thing pass until I lost my other rat Liza. It was the most emotionally painful thing I've ever witnessed. I just hope Lua didn't suffer like Liza did. I just hope none of them suffered. I hope nobody suffers ever again but alas hope is futile in that matter.\nI don't know what to do aside from continuing to give my best and most righteous effort in life. They would expect no more and no less of me. I wish they could be here for my benefit, but I also hope they are at peace. \n\nI'm going to be okay one day", "subreddit": "GriefSupport"}

{"post_id": "ce9cid", "created_utc": 1563346703, "title": "My Georgia Peach", "author": "SomeDumbGuyFromMD", "self_text": "I adopted Georgia Peach from the Baltimore County Animal Rescue shelter five years ago. She came home with me on 12 February 2014 and she lost her life 15 July 2019. She was approximately two years old when I adopted her and, some time fairly recently before winding up in the shelter, had a litter of puppies. \n\nI went to the shelter a week before I brought her home to see some dog that I noticed on their website; what that dog was now I could not possibly tell you. I had gotten there a few minutes after that dog had been adopted. I was walking out of their kennel when there was this cute mutt barking her head off at me behind her bars. I stuck my hand through the bars and she started licking my hand. I asked the people working there to let me see her and we took her outside where I walked around with her and gave her some treats. \n\nAfter about ten or so minutes of this I walked inside and told the people working the counter to \u201cgive me my dog\u201d. As there was a week left in which her \u201crightful owners\u201d could have came and claimed her I was told that I had to wait. I spent that week very nervous that whomever had owned her would come and claim her; I even searched every lost pet site and Craigslist ad to see if anyone was looking for her and wanted her back. There was no ad for her, and on the 12th of February she was spayed and released to me. I didn\u2019t want to spay her, but that it the rule for adoptions at the shelter. I picked my daughter, then almost 14, up after school and told her the big surprise. We went to the shelter and got our dog, who instantly took to both of us as if she had been our dog for her entire life. There was a bit of a learning curve of course where she learned what I wanted from her and I learned her personality, and at the beginning there were more than a few \u201carguments\u201d between her and I as she was as stubborn and as hardheaded as I was, but there was no period where she was not \u201cmy dog\u201d and I was not \u201cher human\u201d. She was sore from being spayed, and slept with her head on my daughter\u2019s lap on the way home in the back seat of my old car, and once we got home we walked briefly around the yard and then we went inside. She went into my bedroom and laid down by my bed and I curled up on the floor next to her and we took our first nap together. \n\nI don\u2019t know if Georgia was her original name or not, but that\u2019s what the women at the shelter called her and I stuck with it. I added the \u201cPeach\u201d because, duh, obviously her name was Georgia Peach. I called her Peachy, El Puppo Poocho, Das Poochenstein, and a host of other equally stupid nicknames. \n\nBefore I adopted Georgia my Clinical Depression was at a level so deep and so profound that no medication could help treat it. I thought about killing myself every single day; the only reasons why I never did commit suicide was because of my daughter and because I honestly did not have the courage to actually do it. But I hated my life, I hated myself, and I did not want to continue living. Even though I still and will always suffer with Clinical Depression, that dog brought joy and happiness to me just about every single day.\n\nGeorgia was a spoiled-rotten brat of a dog, that\u2019s for sure. She loved her car rides and sticking her head out of the window, especially when we drove over the Conowingo Dam, and hated having her nails trimmed. She LOVED Milk Bone Brushing Chews so much that Milk Bone should have made her their Spokesdog; seriously, she was ADDICTED to them. She would eat them all day long if I let her. She also loved Golden Rewards Duck Jerky Recipe treats that I bought from Walmart; she never got tired of them. She would come sit by my bed and just stare up at me until I gave in and gave her some. She\u2019d often \u201cbutter me up\u201d by \u201cletting me\u201d her and rub her tummy and then would shake her butt and look at me expectantly - this meant that she wanted another Brushing Chew. She LOVED going for a walkie, and how I absolutely regret not taking her for more because I was \u201ctoo tired\u201d and \u201ctoo sore\u201d when I got home from work. \n\nGeorgia HATED dog food. Most dogs will eat the same food twice a day for the majority of their lives but not Princess Peachy. She would refuse to eat the same brand and/or type of food for more than a week or two at a time and I would have to buy her something else until she got tired of that, too. She also always expected some sort of treat or present whenever I came into the house with a shopping bag. She was worse than a five year old kid! \n\nTwo and a half years ago Georgia became horribly ill. I took her to the vet where it was discovered that she was diabetic and her body was shutting down from diabetic ketones and pancreatitis. The vets demanded $1,000 up front before they would even start treating her; I was told to pay right then and there or put her down or let her slip into a coma and die. I was able to give those evil, vile people their grand, and my friends put together a GoFundMe campaign where they donated another $2,000 for her week long treatment. Their kindness and love gave me two and a half more years with my Puppers, and I thought that I would have more. I had to watch her diet and had to give her two injections of insulin daily. The diabetics took her eyesight last year but she was still a happy dog in spite of her blindness. She would often have bad days, and over the last year she seemed to have more bad days than good, but she was still a happy and very loving dog. \n\nBut Friday evening Georgia wouldn\u2019t eat, and she got progressively worse over the weekend. There were no vets open and I could not get off of work (I work for Frito-Lay and am under a very strict attendance policy involving \u201cpoints\u201d for calling off, and they will absolutely fire you if you reach those points. As I was at 3 out of the 5 allowable points, I couldn\u2019t take off of work and I did not have the money to take her to the local (evil, vile, greedy) emergency animal hospitals. I thought that she just had a cold and would get better. I was so, so wrong. \n\nThe same illness took her again. Her body began to shut down. I took her to her vet as soon as they opened at 7:30 Monday morning and they told me that the vet would not be in until 9 and so I should take her to the emergency animal hospital in Bel Air, Harford County, Maryland. DO NOT TAKE YOUR PETS TO THOSE HORRIBLE PEOPLE. The Technicians were kind, the girls working the desk were kind, but the Doctor was a fat, cruel, uncaring, compassion-less b*tch that I hate with every single fiber of my being. I\u2019m sorry to be so blunt, but it\u2019s true. Vets care more about money than they do about animals, and when I said as much she had the \u201cballs\u201d to say to me \u201cWell sir, you get paid for your work\u201d. NO ONE IS GOING TO DIE IF THEY DO NOT GET A BAG OF CHEETOS, YOU EVIL, GREEDY, COLD, CALLOUS, CALLOW, CRUEL WOMAN. But you hold the power of life over death in your hands and refuse to help a sick, suffering, and innocent animal unless someone sticks a ridiculously large amount of money into your fat, greedy hands! I make $23/hr. I\u2019m not poor but I\u2019m far from rich, but I could have easily made payments each and every week until the $3,500 was paid off and would have GLADLY done so in order to save my best friend. But your greedy, evil a$$ wouldn\u2019t even allow me to make weekly payments. I\u2019ve been at my job for three years, you cow, and my job is more stable and secure than even yours is! In over 20 years my plant has never laid off even one single employee, never. I could have made payments each and every week and would have loved you for it. It\u2019s improbable that \u201cDoctor Ruby\u201d will ever read this, but if she does somehow I want her to know how much I hate her. You are Greed and Cruelty Incarnate. \n\nThey would not treat her unless I could pay $1,500 to $3,500 and I did not have the money. I could not borrow the money from family. I applied for Care Credit or whatever it is and they turned me down as my credit score has tanked this year due to some bad luck and poor financial choices on my part, and so they made me pay them $231 to murder my best friend. \n\nMy girlfriend and my daughter came to say goodbye to Peachy and to be with me. I was inconsolable and still pretty much am, although I\u2019m not crying as much as I was on Monday. It\u2019s 2:47am and I\u2019m typing this as I sit on my bench in front of Georgia\u2019s grave and my grief, sorrow, anger, regret, and guilt is tearing me apart. \n\nThankfully my employers allowed me to use a Vacation Day Monday and Tuesday, and were going to allow me to take the rest of the week (I normally have off on Thursdays and Fridays) but I wish that I would have went to work Tuesday night and I am going to go back to work tonight. To be in this house without her here is tearing my heart and my soul into pieces. She should be here with me, bugging me for a Brushing Chew or for her Duck Treats; instead she\u2019s buried in the ground a foot in front of where I currently am sitting. \n\nI don\u2019t really expect anyone to read all of this. I just needed to write it to help me with my thoughts and with my grief. \n\nGeorgia Peach, I am so sorry. You were such a good girl and you deserved a longer and better life. It\u2019s my fault that you are dead because I didn\u2019t have $3,000 measly dollars to save you. You were always there for me whenever I came home from a shitty night at work or wherever my depression was at its peak, and I couldn\u2019t be there for you when you needed me the most. I am the single biggest piece of shit on the face of the earth. I love you, girl, so much, and I miss you so much it literally hurts my heart. I have to believe that there is a heaven and that you\u2019re now waiting for me to get there one day or I couldn\u2019t face even one more day right now. I didn\u2019t deserve your love but you gave it to me in abundance anyway. I don\u2019t deserve your forgiveness but I hope that you can forgive me nonetheless. I love you Peachy, and I miss you, and life is so painful without you right now. Everyone says it\u2019ll get better in time, but I don\u2019t believe that. I think that it becomes easier to deal with the pain in time, but not easier. When you died you took a piece of my soul with you.", "subreddit": "GriefSupport"}

But that was because I was using social media more often then. I've since largely forgone IG, FB, and Snapchat because I either don't like their UI or the content.\n\nNow 15mo ago I lost my cat. He was my everything growing up. I basically cut off a lot of my friends as I became a recluse from grief. I also lost 2 jobs last year where I saw a lot of my friends regularly. Adulting is hard. So is keeping up friendships over text when you don't see people in person and are grieving. My friends also seemed to stop caring after I left those jobs so it was mutual parting in most cases I guess.\n\nLast week my dad died. I didn't tell really anyone I knew that he was in the hospital from a stroke or being moved around from one treatment center to another as he recovered. I was having a hard time dealing with some things he'd done and didn't really care about him until the very end when it was inevitable he wasn't progressing anymore and would soon die.\n\nNow not having spoken to a lot of friends in the last year I didn't really know how to reconnect with people, let alone dropping a bombshell in the same sentence that, no I'm not ok because my dad is dying/has died. So I didn't really know where to tell people apart from social media where I'm still connected even though I don't use it anymore. The accounts are there, just haven't been posted on in months, maybe even a year plus.\n\nI didn't want to post immediately. I know my siblings didn't post, they don't for deaths, but they're also in good contact with their friends and most of them knew already and have expressed condolences. I wanted to wait. I found a good picture of us, thought of some things to say, but mostly just winged it. I waited until today when he got cremated. That felt better. I want to post funeral info later but I didn't want that to be how I told my friends he died.\n\nAdmittedly I don't like social media tributes anymore for grief or thanks. Publicly praising someone for a major accomplishment I think is ok, but I feel like you should thank people in person or with a gift and say your goodbyes in person or even privately with loved ones. Social media feels excessive to me and asking for validation. I don't think it respects the loss.\n\nBut I felt like I had no choice because I haven't spoken to more than a few people or been seeing friends lately. I didn't know how else to share that news. Some people on there knew him and I wanted to share funeral info later without inviting individually but saying, \"if you please you may come,\" to whoever can see my accounts.\n\n**Rambling over.** How do you feel about posing online when someone close dies? Do you do it before or after the funeral, immediately after death, only after you've told those who need to be told privately? Do you say anything at all? Do you think we do it for validation or more like my case where you want to share with people you haven't seen or spoken to in a while but want to know anyway? Do you think it helps you grieve or do you feel obligated?\n\nWhat's your opinion in today's social media heavy culture?", "subreddit": "GriefSupport"}

It was expected; she was on hospice for over a year. I grieved for three long years before it happened. She lost a long battle with COPD... but really it was losing her own mother 29 years ago that did her in. \n\nMy grandmother died when I was roughly 6 months old. She died slow. She had end stage breast cancer and the tumor crushed the life right out of her. My mother was the baby, the only girl. She said when her mother died she almost died right with her. She said I was the one her saved her life. That if I wasn't so tiny and so needful that she wouldn't go on. Not couldn't. Wouldn't.\n\nIt made me laugh to hear her tell me I was her guardian angel. I was not expected. Nine months before I came to be my mother was filing for divorce (she told me in secret while I helped her bathe some months ago). She discovered she was pregnant amidst all the turmoil of her mother's slow death and the slow death of her marriage. She saw it as a sign, and decided to stay with my father. (I am the glue that held her life together.) \n\nI am the baby of our tiny family and the youngest grand child on both sides. I was overlooked. I was quiet and nervous and a little more than just a bit neurotic. I felt like my birth brought with it some darkness of death. I came to be and everyone else seemed in a hurry to go: Her mother passed before I took my first steps. My fathers eldest brother died suddenly before I had my first day at school (his daughter soon thereafter breaking her neck and becoming a quadriplegic). My mother's father died after a swift decline into dementia in my 10th year; my father's father following soon after losing his short battle with leukemia (proceeding his own mother by merely 4 months). His mother was next, my Yia Yia, who went peacefully in her sleep. And I could never forget my nephew. Only living for one whole day before he was gone. (He'd be 15 now). Countless great uncles and aunts, swarms of cousins removed. All before I was even old enough to vote. I knew the inside out of the local funeral home. It had become a place of food, of cousins, of playing in dark clothes outside in the sand. It was home. But six weeks ago, it was not. It was something else.\n\nI could see it coming for her. Every day. She started smoking cigarettes when she was 14. Salems, she said. (My first one was a Marlboro Light. The ones she smoked back when I was 15.) She smoked and smoked and it was her crutch. She was anxious. And just a tad neurotic. Her smoking helped her crazy (she said). When her mother died, she smoked more. She was racing her anxiety and depression to the punch. She never could catch her breath. Ever since I was in this world, she was sick. She coughed. Back then it was just called chronic bronchitis. Now it sounds more sinister. There was not a day she did not hack. She broke her bird like ribs coughing. Broke blood vessels. Couldn't sleep in the same room as my father for all the noise and up and down she made. The sound never leaves my ears. I can remember her cough more than I can remember the sound of her laugh. I begged her to stop. We all did. She wouldn't quit. She couldn't. They put her on oxygen about four years ago. That's the same year I put out my last cigarette. I had leaned on them for 10 years, smoking my crazy away (I said to my husband; I had started that cough the same year.)\n\n\nI am 29 years old. Death is no stranger. It is a familiar friend. But six weeks ago was the first time in my life it came and left me with a place so vastly empty I cannot seem to skirt around it. I cannot fill it with useless things; they fall right through and slip away into the dark. I cannot hang decorations over it to hide the ugliness. I cannot seal it up and go on with life like I thought  I could five weeks ago. I cannot push it away. \n\nI have grieved my whole life for my mother. I could see it, I thought I could beat it. I am lost and confused and I feel infinitely alone. I spent the last 29 years greeting Death. I never let it set up shop, never felt the sadness other people wrestle with. But today I am scared.

Parts of the day four years ago are somehow both fuzzy-hard to remember and starkly vivid at the same time. It was a beautiful morning, I remember that clearly. The sky was light blue and the air was warm and humid as July tends to be here in Wisconsin. Almost exactly as it is now.\n\nI'd be lying if I told you I remember what I was doing before the phone calls started coming in. First my mother, then Zo's grandmother Joan Adams, my mother again leaving a voicemail in a frustrated and alarmed tone to call her back immediately. I can't remember who first told me, it could have been either listening to a voicemail or a frantic text message. There had been an accident.\n\nAt first when my mother told me I brushed it off. My brain wanted to process these messages as a mistake. I thought maybe Joan had relayed a message to my mother about an earlier accident. I tried to tell her I already knew Zo had gotten into a small fender-bender earlier and it was no big deal. I had no idea what actually was going on 270 miles southwest of me on Highway 100 just outside of Cedar Rapids.\n\nFive hours away my daughter had started her day. She got out of bed and brushed through her long blonde hair. She gathered her work clothes and started getting dressed. Earlier Zo had received a message asking if she would be willing to work at the Culvers in Cedar Rapids instead of the one in her hometown of Marion. She took her job seriously and was willing to change her schedule, she was a hard worker.\n\nThis day however she was starting to run late and hurried out to her blue Oldsmobile Cutlass Supreme. Later a neighbor would tell me that he had become accustomed to hearing Zo's car start up with its stereo playing loud before she would tear off for work or school. On her way out the door she had passed by her beloved toy Poodle 'Squirt' and her grandma Joan, who was out front gardening.  Joan was still outside when she heard the emergency vehicle sirens in the distance.\n\nZoee hadn't made it very far from where she started, just a few seconds down Highway 100. We still do not know exactly what was going on inside the cabin of her vehicle that morning. We do know that her car made an absolutely sudden almost 90 degree turn. Her Cutlass Supreme jumped over the small curb dividing East and West-bound traffic and into the path of a large truck.\n\nAt that same moment local weatherman for television station KGAN Justin Roberts was driving west on Highway 100. We can't know for sure the trucks exact speed but it was assumed he was driving approximately the speed limit. Given the lack of tire tracks on the road it seems to have all happened so fast he barely had time to step on the breaks. The aqua blue Cutlass Supreme flew directly in front of his truck and the two vehicles collided violently.\n\nThe age of the vehicles as well as their size and weight made all the difference in the world. Zoee's car was struck mid-center in a kind of t-bone fashion causing the Cutlass to utterly explode into pieces. Mr. Robert's truck was a heavy duty vehicle and both he and it took much less damage compared to Zo and her Oldsmobile.\n\nThe moment of impact her vehicle disintegrated around her. The sheer violence of the collision is probably unimaginable for us. We do know however that paramedics found her in what was left of the backseat of the car. We do not know when her heart stopped but we do know the EMT's worked extremely hard to get it started up again.\n\nThe medics rushed my daughter to an emergency room where Doctors and nurses worked incredibly hard to stabilize her. While this was happening I was 300 miles away frantically getting ready to gather my mother and her things for the trip down. I called the Sheboygan airport hoping there might be someone willing to fly to Eastern Iowa Airport, but sadly there was no one available.\n\nI drove quickly to pick up my mother and the two of us started the almost 5 hour car ride just after 11am. My intention was to drive fast but careful. I did not want to cause another accident but I'm pretty sure I wound up speeding quite a bit. Throughout the drive down we were getting calls and texts from Joan keeping us updated.\n\nI recall telling myself the accident probably wasn't that bad at first. Probably just a fender-bender? Joan's next calls brought the harsh light of reality down like a sledgehammer. I only realized how serious this was when she told me the EMTs had restarted Zo's heart at the scene. Even then I still stubbornly told myself everything was going to be okay. This started to change when Joan told me they were getting ready for scans to determine if there was any brain activity.\n\nThere is a little bit of confusion and miscommunication about what happened when Joan called me back next. She told me how grim things were and asked if I wanted her to put the phone near to Zoee's ear for me to talk to her. I perceived this as being the time for me to plead with Zo to hold on and keep fighting to survive and that was what I did. Later I would understand that Joan actually meant for this to be the time for me to say my final goodbyes.\n\nIt's important for me to state, and I cannot emphasize this enough, how much of an intense and terrible situation this was! ANY and ALL miscommunications were just that, accidental miscommunications. Joan went so far above and beyond while trying to keep us informed, all the while dealing with what was undoubtedly the worst nightmare of her (and our) lives. For this and countless other things I owe her a debt I can never repay.\n\nThe way I remember what comes next differs from how things were happening in the emergency room. From my perspective Zo was in the ER hooked up to a ventilator with IVs, life support, keeping her body alive. I only recently learned she was never actually connected to a ventilator like I\u2019d thought. Breathing was being done for her manually by way of nurses taking turns with an 'ambu-bag' instead. Staff switched person-to-person for over 4 hours trying to get Zoee back.\n\nAgain, I guess I misunderstood the way things happened next because I remember being told if Zo's brain scans came back without activity medical staff felt it was time to stop. The way the conversation went over the phone left me feeling like I was being asked to agree to make the hard choice, almost as if a consensus was needed. The question being \u201cif scans came back negative did we all agree it was time to stop?\u201d This was not however what was happening. I was being told what they were already planning to do and my input was not really required.\n\nI continued to drive while waiting for brain scan info to come in. Somehow I thought the decision to leave her on life support (or not) would be the exclusive choice of Zo\u2019s mother and I. In the end it didn\u2019t matter either way. The scans were complete and my phone was ringing. Joan was calling to let me know the doctors had determined there was no longer any brain activity conducive to human life and all hope was lost. My little girl was gone.\n\nI pulled over onto the side of the road and cried with my mother for what seemed like a long time. I called my father and let him know Zo was gone and we all three cried. Time passed and I felt like I wanted to just sit there on the side of the road, but I also knew I needed to get to the hospital. I tried to compose myself as best I could and merged the car back onto the road through a fuzzy haze of tears.\n\nWhen the GPS told us we were about 12 minutes away from the hospital the final call came in. Shortly after staff had discontinued the ambu-bag my daughter\u2019s heart finally gave up. I pulled over once again and cried. I think cried as hard as I ever had or ever will again. We drove the rest of the way to the hospital. \n\nWhen my mother and I got to the hospital we talked with Zoee's mother Kelly and Kelly's husband Bob, as well as Joan Adams and Dave. They asked me if I wanted to see Zoee before they took her away, but I just couldn't do it. I couldn't bring myself to see her like that. I might have if I'd gotten there before but not after she was completely gone. I still wrestle whether I made the right choice or not even four years later.\n\nAs of July 11th it\u2019s been exactly four years since we lost Zo. Every day has been a challenge since that day. I've gone to countless therapy sessions, been hospitalized, and even held a successful raffle to help pay for her substantial funeral and burial costs, and I've cried. I've cried a lot. I've cried more than I thought was humanly possible.\n\nIn the time since the accident I've had A LOT of advice and counseling. Without a doubt the thing I've heard the most is \"What do you think Zoee would want for you? Don't you think she would want you to be happy?\" I am of course certain that she would (and did) want me to be happy. This ideal however seems to ring hollow for me. I understand the fundamental principles of it but putting it into practical use feels like trying to climb mount Everest for me.\n\nThe undeniable truth: losing your only child is **hell. It\u2019s pure hell**.  It can't be reasoned with or bargained with. It can't be ignored or spun. It can't be suppressed with sex, or drugs, or alcohol. In reality it can only be endured.\n\nThe one thing I've taken away from this whole situation is that time is so very short and we need to love and appreciate our family and friends right now, in the moment, and as much as we possibly can. Over time I\u2019ve occasionally felt like some people may have grown tired of hearing me plead and prosthelytize to love and cherish our families right now, in the moment, because everything can change in seconds. I get it, I really do. I can easily see how something like this could get annoying. Honestly though, I don't really know what else to say. It's all I've got for right now.\n\nPerhaps one day in the future I'll have found some kind of wisdom, some greater truths about love and loss? Maybe it'll take me another four years? Maybe it will take the rest of my life?  Honestly I have no idea and all I can do is keep moving forward with an open heart and mind.", "subreddit": "GriefSupport"}

I am not in the best space mentally right now.\n\nTo start, my husband and I were together for 7 years, married for four. I loved him with all my heart, but he had untreated anxiety that he refused to seek help for. This greatly affected our relationship as he got worse, having issues holding down a job or going places, not being able to be around many people or wanting me too far away from him. . The past few years have been rough between the two of us, due to his emotional needs along with me taking care of all financial responsibility. Even through all of this, I never even though of divorce with him because he was the love of my life and I couldn't abandon him.\n\nThree months ago, he got into a car accident that proved fatal. All of my old friends who I haven't been able to keep up with came out the woodwork to help me deal. They kept me busy, taking me to concerts, movies, and just constantly giving me company and something to think about. As this continued, I started to feel like I had been missing out on this while I was with my husband, which made me feel horrible that I was some kind of happy that my husband had passed.\n\nFast forward to last night. I have finally started selling/keeping all of his old thing to try to and make room to move to a smaller place by myself. Going through his computer to clean it for sale, I found a Journaling/diary app and my stomach dropped.  Over the last few entries, he was talking about how he was failing me and making me miserable, and that I deserved something better. The final entry was the day before the car wreck, and it leads everything to seem like it was no accident but a suicide.\n\nThis realization has opened everything back up. Having accepted his death was an accident, to  learn this was him taking his own life. I feel sick knowing that he ended his life to make me happier, and I was *actually* happy that I was now by myself. I am such a shit person that my own husband died to try and make me happier. I don't know how to live with the guilt of this, all I can think of is how I drove him to this.", "subreddit": "GriefSupport"}

oh my girls are here!\", and i miss her frail little hands holding mine when i used to tell her about my day or about school or about whatever was on my mind. i feel guilty that i hadn't cherished every moment with her, and that i hadn't spent more time with her when she lived at home. \n\ni miss her singing and her cooking and her jokes and the way she always made an effort to invite my idiot uncle to everything, or how she even included her ex husband in christmas and easter and birthdays. i miss her so fucking much, and on some days, like today, it's really hit me hard and i keep on crying because i miss her so much and i have so many regrets.\n\ni wish she could've seen me get married, or have even met the girl i loved. i wish she could've met her great grandchildren because i know how much joy it would've bought her. the christmas before she died, i got her framed photos to put up in her room of all of her family - my mum and i, my cousins and her great granddaughter, as well as my uncle, and she cried because she just loved us all so much. i hope she knew we all loved her like that too. i hope she knows what a hole she left in my life, because now i don't know who to call to ask about stain removers or how to iron my pants right or any of the simple things she'd be able to answer. i wish i'd sat and let her teach me how to sew. i hope i made her proud. i hope i still make her proud.\n\ni always think about how in the last few days of her life, she was confused, and sleeping a lot, so i didn't call because i knew she wouldn't answer her phone. i wish i had called, just in case. i regret not calling. it had been three days since i spoke to her when she died, and the morning we got the call, we were literally getting ready to go and see her. i regret not calling so, so much. i wish i had.\n\ni miss her so much, that when i get caught in the feeling like i have today, it's so difficult to move on from. it's just impossible for me to accept. i felt like i already had so much grief on my heart that losing her was just too much, it couldn't have been real, and i still have no idea how to process it. \n\ni'm not really sure how to end this post. if you read all of that, thank you, and i apologise for repeating myself so much and for improper grammar, etc.\n\nrest in peace nanny. i love you so much.", "subreddit": "GriefSupport"}

I would call him about anything. The only people I really communicated to we're my dad and my husband. I still haven't deleted his number even though it's disconnected. And I won't delete his text.\n\nI found out I was pregnant in January and when I told my dad he was so happy, he lovedddd babies. He would tell me how he wanted to hold stranger's babies because they're so cute, but he couldn't cause he would look like some sort of weirdo. So I was so happy I was going to get to give him a grand child to hold and love. \n\nThe last text I sent him was an ultrasound picture of his grand daughter, before we knew it was a girl. 10 days before he passed. \n\nI'm also very stressed about giving birth because none of my family will be there. My MIL and FIL will be there which is nice...but the only person I NEED there is my father, and he can't be. I'm worried this happy day will turn very sad for me.\n\nI'm either numb, or working, or working to distract myself from thinking about my father. Which makes me feel even more guilty because I love my dad so freaking much but I push his memory away just so I can function and go to work and be okay for my baby.\n\nI would give anything just to talk to my dad again.", "subreddit": "GriefSupport"}

For our first Christmas he gave me a female baby tortoise because I just adore torts and turtles and I\u2019ve always wanted to have one. Her name was Mirta. Mirta helped me with loneliness and depression even though she was just a small tort. I was emotionally connected to her. She is also a symbol of mine and boyfriend\u2019s love. She was my everything. \n\nAlmost a week ago we went on a vacation for 5 days and left our tort at my parents place to take care of her. She was at their place a couple of times before (every time it was for a week) so I didn\u2019t think much about it, they knew how to handle and feed her. They knew they had to be careful with her because she was so small, just a year and a half old. \n\nAnyway, my mom comes home from work at 6-7 p.m. so it was my dad who took care of Mirta most of the time because he doesn\u2019t work. Everyday he took her outside behind the house so she could walk on the grass and get some sunshine. Whenever Mirta was outside, my parents would always have to keep an eye on her because they have a huge sheperd who kept trying to reach and grab her so she was never left alone. \n\nTwo days ago while Mirta was on the grass, my father went in the house to check on something. He said he was gone for 2-3 minutes, but that doesn\u2019t seem right (he lies when he\u2019s guilty to make himself seem less guilty). While he was gone, the dog reached her, grabed her and chewed off her head. After my father came back from the house he saw her leg hanging from the dog\u2019s mouth. He had to beat the dog in order to get her out of his mouth. He quickly ran into the house and put her under her UVB lamp to heat her up, but it was too late since she was already dead (he didn\u2019t realize she had lost her head). \n\nSo that\u2019s the story of how my father killed a little creature I loved the most in the world. \n\nHe called me an hour after it happened, traumatized and all. During the call I couldn\u2019t say a word. One day later after I came to my senses a bit and was able to speak, I called him to confront him. I realized that he was more traumatized than me and just wanted to calm him down (my mom told me he hadn\u2019t slept at all and got diarrea). \n\nDuring that call he didn\u2019t give me a chance to say anything. He kept saying that it wasn\u2019t his fault, that Mirta could\u2019ve died at anytime, and that she was JUST a tortoise, that she\u2019s easily replaced and that he\u2019ll just get me another one. He told me it was my fault that I told him to put her on the grass for a few minutes everyday.\n\nI don\u2019t know what to do with myself. I\u2019m so lost, sad and angry. I tried to forgive him, but after the last call I don\u2019t know how. Since her death I can\u2019t sleep, I cry all the time and can\u2019t function like a normal person. I just want to find a way to forgive him and mourn the loss. \n\nSo please, any advice is appreciated. Thank you.", "subreddit": "GriefSupport"}

My husband and I were moving to our first actual home together, after moving half of the contents of our apartment he was taking a break and went to the bathroom. He collapsed in the bathroom and I held him while he died. That day my world was destroyed. It will be three years this September and its even more painful than that day bc of other events that happened afterwards bc its all piled on top of one another. I feel empty and alone. I met someone and we were friends for two and a half years. We developed feelings and started a relationship in April. He's an amazing guy, very supportive and loving. But I find myself constantly comparing him and how we interact to my late husband. (Not to him just in my head) It makes me feel horrible bc I know each relationship is different, each love is different bc people are different. But yet I'm laying in bed at 4 am next to an amazing man crying over a ghost. Since I lost him its really hard for me to function. I feel like I'm standing still and the whole world is passing me by. I have been having debilitating panic attacks, nightmares, sleep walking, I barely leave my house, I just break down randomly over stupid stuff. I have been to doctors, to therapy, numerous trips to the er for massive panic attacks. I was told to grieve naturally, take Niacin, and use essential oils to relax. And my favorite was get over it. Every day I wake up in panic attacks bawling and a lot of the times throwing up and covered in stress hives. The er docs solution was sedatives and they help bc I can't stay awake most days. Many of my friends and family have walked away from me bc I'm too sad and they can't deal with me anymore. They tell me I want to feel the way I do. That I struggle bc I want to.   So I have no support system anymore, haven't for quite some time. I feel utterly alone. I just quit talking to people about how I'm feeling.  I lock myself away in my room and stay alone 95% of my life. It seems like the grief is never going to end, in which I know in time things do get better, but when?  When am I going to be able to wake up without panic attacks, without hives, without the horrible void of pain I feel in the center of my chest? I know grief doesn't have a timeline so that question is irrelevant. I want to be able to function and live my life. But I'm really struggling to get past losing him.

Also a weird mystery?", "author": "bunnyohara", "self_text": "I'm entering my third week on this awful journey and I feel like I slip deeper into a darkness I never knew existed with each day that passes. \n\nOne of my best friends, lovers, &amp; partners in life passed suddenly on July 2nd, after spending nearly a decade together. He's one of the only, if not the only, person who understood my serious struggles with mental health. Just knowing he was out there would comfort me in dark times. He struggled so much, too. I grieve not only losing him forever, but thinking about how much he lost to his mental health struggles before he passed is gut wrenching. He was an extremely talented artist and had so much to share with the world. He had so many hopes and dreams but most days couldn't leave his bed. He was so kind hearted, sensitive and loved so hard but his anxiety tragically made it impossible for him to show or receive that at times. After I adjust to this new agony, I hope I can do something to keep his art alive.\n\nI just don't know how I'm going to live the rest of my life without him. It's unfathomable to me. I feel like I'm really starting to lose my mind. I feel like I'm living in two worlds and it's very hard for me to focus on or comprehend anything. I talk to him a lot, write him letters, I'm still sending him messages on Skype, I cry &amp; cry and beg him to show me that he's still with me. Sometimes I can feel his hands on me, I've been woken up to whispers which I know is probably just stress induced sleep paralysis but still. I considered checking myself into a hospital tonight, but my anxiety medication took the edge off. \n\n**Here's the mysterious part:** He had only just turned 30 and had no known health issues. We don't know what happened. The state (?) will not release his body nor his possessions - I don't know/understand why. His memorial is set for nearly 2 months after his passing, another thing I don't understand. I know even victims of crime aren't held for weeks like this. They did perform a full autopsy and I was just told this evening it could take 2-5 additional weeks for them to get back to us with the results, or even just release his body/possessions to his family. I've never heard of this happening before and can't find anything like this online either. We're in the US, if that helps. A parent found him deceased in his bed when they went to wake him up from a nap, in their house. Can anyone think of a reason they would be holding his body this long? They won't even give his mom his cell phone. It's so weird. This factor, I think, is making the grieving process that much stranger for me. I'd love to hear your theories. I'm considering some pretty outlandish theories at this point so nothing anyone could say would shock/offend/upset me. \n\nThank you for reading. If you have any advice on losing someone you are deeply in love with, please let me know.

She was a labor and delivery nurse and she loved it. She came from a beefalo farm in Michigan and always dreamed of moving back. She was the lovechild of an affair and never knew her father. She had four half-siblings who she always wanted to find and meet. Her whole life she wanted to be a mother and she had four beautiful girls. She loved to play God of War. She hated her legs. Tree trunks, she called them. She loved to dance, but was so bad at it. We would sit on the backporch and sing songs (badly) with/to each other. \n\nHer name was Sarahjo and I miss her.", "subreddit": "GriefSupport"}

One whole month. It doesn't feel like it's been that long since that Sunday at 2:03 pm. Every single day since then has been such a blur. I thought each day I would get a bit better, but it's been the complete opposite. Each day that passes the more heavy my heart feels and the more it hurts.\n\nI'm annoyed that I feel like I can't talk to anyone in my family about it. I don't want to make them worried about me or interrupt their own grieving with my feelings. I'm annoyed that I don't wanna talk to my friends about my grandpa anymore cause I feel like I'm gonna annoy them.\n\nThe hardest part is that I'm not only dealing with the loss of my grandpa, but also the trauma that I feel like I went through.\n\nI had a test on the Wednesday of that week, and my parents didn't want to tell me anything until I took my test (which I failed, lol). I was walking home and my mom called me and told me that my grandpa was in the hospital (he was admitted on Tuesday). He had been sick on and off the whole time i've been in college, so I didn't really think anything too bad. He always made it back out. On Thursday, around 4:55 pm I got a phone call from my dad and I knew. He didn't have to say anything, I just told him I needed him to fly me home that night. I was in the middle of cooking when he called, and I just threw what I was making out. I grabbed a backpack, put a couple of underwear in it and called my friend to see if he could take care of my cat. Then I was at the airport. Then I landed at home. \n\nThe next day, Friday, was the day that they were going to disconnect him from life support. 6 pm. I woke up and got to the hospital at around 10 am. I was the first one there. I was there when the priest came. I was there to watch my grandma sign the DNR papers (possibly the hardest thing i've ever had to go through). I was there sitting by his side watching as the minutes and the hours went. I watched my family gather. I didn't talk, I couldn't. I had no words, only tears. The time finally came. We stepped out while the hospital staff disconnected him and took all the tubes out. I remember it like it was literally yesterday. We stayed for two more hours. My parents made me leave around 8, because I hadn't eaten all day. I didn't want to leave his side... but my aunt promised me she would sleep there that night and that he wouldn't be alone.\n\nThat night was the worst one. I have never had anybody in my life pass. He wasn't gone yet, but I knew that it was only a matter of time. I couldn't stop thinking about my grandma and the fact that she had to sign a fucking piece of paper that made sure he would not be helped when he stopped breathing. I couldn't stop thinking about the fact that the life she knew, being by my grandpa's side for 30+ years, was all about to be over. I had a panic attack that night, because I now knew what it felt like to lose somebody, and I worried that I would have to go through this again with both of my grandma's. \n\nI feel like it isn't fair. I know that he's in a better place and not suffering, but it's not fair. I'm only 22. My mom's grandma didn't die until she was in her 40s. I was going to fucking graduate from college this semester. The whole 4 years being away from my family my biggest fear was getting THAT phone call... I almost made it out without having to go through this. \n\nSaturday came and went. He hadn't passed yet. He was on morphine and couldn't feel anything. I thought I was feeling better and accepting and coming to terms with this new future... but oh boy, I was so fucking wrong.\n\nI told my mom that night that I wanted to go to church in the morning. I don't know what it was that made me feel like I needed to go. I went, and oh god I CRIED. I didn't care that people could see me or hear me. I just needed God to hear me. I asked him to please take my grandpa, so he could rest. After church, we went back to the hospital. I talked to the doctor, and she told me she didn't think he would have lasted this long. It was me, my uncle, my grandma, mom, dad, step-aunt, and 5 year old cousin. Just waiting around. I had my flight already booked for that evening at 5. \n\nMy grandma is religious and superstitious. She said the nurse told her that he was waiting for somebody to come say goodbye, so that he could pass. I always thought my grandma was a little bit crazy, but it happened. My mom's cousin, who lived with my grandma and grandpa for many years, came to say her goodbye and within not even 5 minutes of her walking through the door he passed...\n\nIt's crazy, seeing somebody die. He was pink and breathing one minute, and the next he was so pale and quiet. 2:03 pm on Sunday, June 23rd 2019. The day that changed me forever.\n\nI've been depressed and have been dealing with anxiety for 10+ years, but nothing could have ever prepared me for the pain that is grieving. I feel like nothing matters anymore. I feel empty. I feel sad; so sad that I can't even cry about it anymore. I don't know who I am or what I want anymore. I miss him every day, more and more.\n\nI feel like this whole thing didn't even make sense, but writing it out and sharing has made me feel a bit better.", "subreddit": "GriefSupport"}

For the past 4 years my mom was pretty ill due to mental health and prescription pill issues. She divorced my dad, isolated herself from the family, realized she made a mistake and just had no will to live. It was a very messy situation. Long story short, I was the closest to her post the isolation and would try to see her at least a few times a month. It was hard keeping a relationship with her but I tried my best as I knew she was very unhealthy and would die young. \n\nA few weeks before she died she got pretty sick, she thought it was the flu, and I went to pick her up and she didn't answer the door. Had to had EMS come break down the door, she had had a seizure and was unconscious. At the EMR I was completely alone. My brother and cousin were on their way but they were in different parts of the city so it took them about 2 hours. While she was there the doctor asked me what her situation was and after I told him her history he said to me point blank \"I don't think she will survive this, and if she does she will have serious brain damage, her body is deteriorating rapidly\". He asked me to decide if I wanted to sign a DNR or not, and I wanted to talk to my brother first. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBefore I could even get a hold of my brother on the phone the doctor ran out and said her heart was failing and I had to decide right now. I decided not to resuscitate her. Which, I think was the right decision. I know she would have been in much more pain if she survived this and it would have been postponing the inevitable since the damage she had done to her body was past the point of repair. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm not just dealing with her death, I am dealing with all of the unresolved issues from 4 years ago. The woman I saw for the past 4 years was not my mom. She was so sick. She had no will. Never left the house. It was a bleak situation. I tried to help her but you can't help someone who doesn't want to be helped. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI am in therapy. I have been travelling, working out, have a dog so I get out, doing fun things, moping around some.. but I feel so.. numb, still. This was 3 months ago.

What im trying to get at here is that I miss my mom so much every day and I\u2019m devastated by her death but I don\u2019t feel like im grieving if that makes sense? I felt awkward at the viewing and the funeral because I was just as upset as everyone else but never showed it on the outside. Let me give you some back story now. First of all she had been suffering quite a bit before her death so is it possible my mind just prepared its self for her death without me realizing? Again like I said she suffered towards the end(hallucinations and pain mostly) and at the time non of us realize she was suffering, we thought she was just making excuses for not wanting to do therapy or take meds. Now that she is gone all the memories flood my mind of us getting upset at her and all I can think about is I didn\u2019t get to say sorry. Is the guilt stopping me from being able to properly grieve? Finally, I am adopted.

Out of everyone in the room the night before, he had asked me if I\u2019d stay with him. \u201cOf course, I\u2019ll stay\u201d I said, smiling gently. \n\nOn the inside, I was falling apart. \n\nWatching what had been unfolding in front of me over the last 15 months was almost too much to bare, and a night in the hospital surrounded by the worst of it was the last place I wanted to be at that moment. \n\nBut I\u2019d never let my composure betray me and let him see that -- this moment was the furthest thing from being about me.\n\n***\n\nOne week prior, we\u2019d checked into the hospital after fluid began building up in his abdomen and ankles. \n\nI was woken up by a call telling me that we needed to go to the hospital. I had slept over at my boyfriend\u2019s house the night before, so I rushed out of bed and he drove me home. I didn\u2019t say a word for the whole drive. \n\nWhen I got home, I went into the room to check on him. Seeing his discomfort, I reassured him that we\u2019ll be leaving soon and everything will be okay. Outside of that moment, I have never experienced a greater disconnect as the one between the words I said that day and what I believed and knew in my heart. \n\nI went downstairs to get changed and as I walked into my bathroom, I fell to my knees.\n\nThis is it, isn\u2019t it?\n\n***\n\nIt was written all over the faces of the doctors and nurses when we arrived at the hospital that day. \n\nThroughout the time that Luke was sick, I never showed weakness around him. I never cried. I never treated him differently -- because who the hell wants to be treated like a sick person by everyone, 24/7? I just wanted things to be normal -- as normal as they could be. \n\nIt didn\u2019t take away from the fact that I felt all of it. I felt the pain of watching him suffer and the dread of what was coming, but I never dare let him see that\u2026 not until that day in the hospital.\n\nPulling back the drapes that separated patients, I walked away quietly as the nurses looked over him, bursting into tears as soon as I was far enough not to be seen or heard. One of the nurses, seeing me break down, led me to a small bathroom around the corner from the emergency room as I tried to compose myself. I splashed water on my face over and over again. \n\n\u201cShit\u2026 Shit\u2026\u201d \n\nThere was no getting rid of my puffy eyes and red nose. How was I supposed to go back out there now?\n\nAs I drew the drapes back into his makeshift room, he looked at me. \n\n\u201cHey, what\u2019s wrong? Are you okay?\u201d he asked.\n\n\u2018Am I okay?\u2019 Can you imagine that? The man with cancer laying in a hospital bed wants to know if I\u2019m okay? \n\nTears streamed down my face again.\n\n\u201cCome here,\u201d he said, as he held my hand. \u201cI\u2019ve never seen you cry throughout this entire ordeal\u2026\u201d Those words stung, not because he meant them in a bad way, but because I knew I had given up my position. I\u2019d given away the upper ground. I\u2019d clued him in to how bad this situation really was. He knew it, but now he knew that I knew it, and that made it all the more real.\n\n\u201cEverything is going to be okay, alright, don\u2019t worry about me,\u201d he said. \u201cIf anything, I\u2019m just excited to see Dad again.\u201d\n\nMy Dad had died in a car accident 8 years prior.\n\nMore tears.\n\n***\n\nThe next week was filled with time in the ICU, tests, and long, drawn out periods of silence, empty time, and the occasional moments of joy and laughter when his friends would come to visit. \n\nThe more time that passed, the more I could see that there was hope in his eyes -- something that made me happy while simultaneously ripping me apart.\n\nThat changed a day later when one of his doctors came to see him. \n\nLuke was brave. He was stronger than anyone I know. He knew what was coming and accepted it. But I don\u2019t think he realised how quickly he\u2019d have to accept it.\n\n\u201cI know things are not good doc, but how long are we talking? A year.. maybe two?\u201d he asked hopefully.\n\nShe looked down at that moment. \n\n\u201cWe\u2019re looking at a little sooner that that, Lukie.\u201d \n\n\u201cMonths?\u201d he asked.\n\nA moment passed.\n\n\u201cWeeks?\u201d he gasped.\n\nI feel like I saw the light go out in his eyes at that moment.\n\n\u201cDid you hear that?\u201d he looked at me incredulously when the doctor left the room. I didn\u2019t know what to say. I was in shock myself.\n\n\u201cWe should\u2026 maybe\u2026 let\u2019s just wait until the other tests come back, alright?\u201d I stammered. This can\u2019t be real. This isn\u2019t happening. Not to my brother.\n\n***\n\n\u201cMom\u2019s going to stay with you tonight, okay?\u201d I said as everyone in the room was packing up to go home. Only one person was allowed to spend the night.\n\n\u201cArrianne, you stay nah,\u201d he replied.\n\n\u201cOf course, I\u2019ll stay\u201d I said, smiling gently.\n\nThat night, like many of the other nights, was restless and sleepless. Every now again, he would wake up dazed and ask, \u201cArrianne, I\u2019m okay, right?\u201d  \n\n\u201cYes, of course Luke, you\u2019re fine. Just go back to sleep. Everything is okay.\u201d \n\nThere was that disconnect again, but now the pressure in between was building up. The act was getting really hard to keep up.\n\n***\n\nAlone in the hospital room that morning, we chatted briefly and I watched as the nurses brought food, checked vitals -- all the usual stuff. \n\nAs time passed, the room next door to ours started to grow loud and rambunctious. I remember feeling like my blood began to boil as I noticed it was bothering Luke. I marched outside determined to find a nurse to help quiet things down. As I opened the door, I noticed people walking in with a sign that said \u201cCongratulations.\u201d Must be a newborn, I thought.\n\nThings died down for a while and we sat, in quiet togetherness, watching an episode of Friends.\n\nAfter a while, a nurse popped in and said that the doctor wanted to see me for a moment. I looked at Luke and he looked at me, and I walked outside.\n\nAs I made my way down the hall following the nurse, two doctors who had their backs turned to me suddenly looked around and stared directly at me. They were both my brother\u2019s doctors.\n\n\u201cWe need to speak to you.\u201d \n\nThere\u2019s something you don\u2019t want to hear from a group of doctors.\n\nWhat followed was a conversation where I was simultaneously present and absent. In psychology, they use a term called dissociation to describe moments like these. Your mind shuts off a piece of itself to protect you from the trauma being inflicted upon you at the moment.\n\n\u201cDo you want to wait for the rest of your family to get here?\u201d they asked me.\n\n\u201cNo, it\u2019s okay. It\u2019s better if you just talk to me,\u201d I replied, taking a deep breath. I knew that my mother couldn\u2019t handle this conversation.\n\nThe nurse led me into one of the patient rooms, pulled me a chair, and I sat in my pajamas, as two doctors and a nurse stood in front of me. The air was thick and heavy in that moment and reflected the gravity of what would unfold in that conversation.\n\n\u201cWe want to make sure you understand what\u2019s happening here\u2026\u201d one of the doctors started. \u201cThis is it. Things are not going to go well from here on out.\u201d\n\nA moment passed.\n\n\u201cOkay... I understand.\u201d I said absent of emotion. \n\n\u201cWe\u2019re looking at somewhere around a week. We just want to make sure that you and your family understand what is coming\u2026\u201d he continued.\n\nAt that moment, the nurse lost her composure, held her face, and left the room. I watched her leave unphased. I looked back at the doctor.\n\n\u201cThings will begin to slow down drastically, and soon he will lose all function. After that, it will be a day or two.\u201d\n\n\u201cI understand,\u201d I said, almost defensively.\n\nI got up and we left the room. As I stepped into the hallway, I looked for the nurse but she was nowhere in sight.\n\nAs I was walking back to Luke\u2019s room, the only thing I could think of in that moment was what I was going to say to him. What had the doctor spoke to me about? What could I tell him that he would actually believe?\n\nThe room next door was loud again and now even more full of people laughing, happy, and celebrating. As I opened his door, I couldn\u2019t help but observe the irony. On the other side of the wall, there were people celebrating the beginning of a new life. On our side of the wall, I had just walked back into my brother\u2019s room with everything the doctors had just described to me: the end of a life.\n\n\u201cWhat did they say?\u201d he asked.\n\nI smiled softly.\n\n\u201cMeh, nothing much. They were just talking about if the fluids build up again, they\u2019ll do some more tests. Nothing to worry about\u2026\u201d I said casually as I sat back down to watch Friends.\n\nBut in my head, my inner voice was trying to get something out, almost desperate to be heard and tell the truth. Somber, defeated, and weak, it spoke: \n\n\u201cBrother, you\u2019re dying.\u201d\n\n***\n\nThe title of this post was inspired by \u2018Brother, I\u2019m Dying\u2019 a book by Edwidge Danticat.

She and I were never really close. She and my brother are/were 12 years older than I, and they moved away when I was probably 10 (now 24) so it\u2019s kinda hard to talk to her now. So I was hoping other people going through what she is going through could give me advice on what I should say when asking if I can come visit.

She has 4 kids (9,7,4&amp;2) and I have kids kids 4&amp;2, so maybe to a splash pad or park? Or is that still to much?

I never forgot he was gone, or had any shock about it because he had been sick for so long and honestly, it was a relief that he was no longer suffering because he had been absolutely miserable (I feel like kind of a jerk for saying it, though). \n\nI have never been a big believer in signs and I don\u2019t believe in a traditional heaven or hell, but I saw a few signs that I took as indications that he was still around and letting me know that he is there. I can\u2019t explain them away, although I\u2019ve tried, and I took comfort in them. I can count on one hand the number of times I\u2019ve dreamed about him since he died, the dreams are so rare that they mess me up when they happen.\n\nAs the anniversary of his death started coming closer, I could feel my anxiety getting worse and the physical symptoms of it have been pretty bad the last few days. I keep telling myself that it\u2019s just a symbolic day, but it feels huge and insurmountable and my brain fog and stomachache that\u2019s set in won\u2019t be convinced otherwise. I know that it will pass, the waves will lessen, the heavy stone of grief will be lighter. Last year was so hard for me that I felt broken, like a shell of what I was and it took me a long time to realize that the crap year doesn\u2019t have to define me, I will heal and be whatever I want to be.\n\nThis has been long and rambling, but I just needed to get it out and acknowledge the day somehow.

Him and my mother had been staying at my house because my brother was redoing their bathroom. On july 4th dad had a seizure where we learned the cancer had spread to his brain and there was nothing more we could do. So he came home to my house where i helped mom care for him (while taking care of a 3month old). By the 8th he was refusing to take even sips of water for his pills and we had to give him liquid morphine. It took him 7 days of absolutely no fluids besides his meds to pass. Mom has been staying with me to help out with the baby as she had been doing on and off before, but now i just feel so lost. I try to be strong, to act normal, but all i want to do is cry and i dont know how to start to grieve. My mom isnt strong all the times and i need to help her emotionally. It is only when she is caring for the baby that she is ok. Honestly my daughter saved is both. But now i need to help my mom start to grieve so she can heal, while finding a way to help me do the same. My days feel so incomplete, and all i can do is just keep trucking. I worry that this will all crash down on me at the worst time and i need to get ahead of it i just dont know how. I know all i can really do is take it one day at a time.

He seemed happy to those he interacted with in the community, but I (23f) always knew him as an alcoholic, drug abusing, bipolar mess. \n\nHis passing wrecked havoc on my emotional, mental, and physical well being, as I completely let myself go and went off the deep end. I\u2019ve gained 40 pounds, became an alcoholic myself, cut off plenty of \u201cfriendships\u201d, strained my family relationships, and couldn\u2019t hold down a job. \n\nOver the past year, I feel like I\u2019ve gotten better. I tried out a couple therapists, tried eating better, tried exercising, tried medications. None of that seemed to last for me, but I was doing okay. My boyfriend and I moved into a nice rental home, I kept a job for 6+ months, I started to accept the way my body is now.\n\nThen for no good reason, this week my depression is back - full swing. I\u2019m crying endlessly, feeling immense pain in my heart but also complete and utter emptiness. I haven\u2019t gone to work for 4 days, and let\u2019s be honest, I\u2019m not going tomorrow either. My anxiety is making me nauseous. It\u2019s all I can do to wake myself up out of a 16+ hour sleep and make my way to the tv. I\u2019ve been binge eating and hardly showering. \n\nMy birthday is in a few days and I\u2019ve been wondering if perhaps that\u2019s why - if I\u2019m realizing yet again how little I\u2019ve done with my life, and how angry I am that my father isn\u2019t here to celebrate with me.\n\nI just want to be happy. I want to like my job. I want to feel accepted by my family. I want real friendships. I want to have my body back. I want to enjoy life again.

I usually take extra time to remember her on the anniversary of her passing and on her birthday.  Usually I'll listen to an artist she used to like (Cranberries, ELO), watch a film that either reminds me of her (Princess Bride, Guardians of the Galaxy) or one that makes me think about life and death (The Fountain).\n\nOn my mom's first birthday after she passed, my wife and I took the little ones (3 and 1 at the time) to a park and released a balloon that said happy birthday, and we told them Grammy would get it.  My daughter still brings that up 5 years later.\n\nI'm interested to learn other innovative ways that you may use to remember your loved ones that have passed.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHere's a poem that resonated with me:\n\n\"As for grief, you'll find it comes in waves. When the ship is first wrecked, you're drowning, with wreckage all around you. Everything floating around you reminds you of the beauty and the magnificence of the ship that was, and is no more. And all you can do is float. You find some piece of the wreckage and you hang on for a while. Maybe it's some physical thing. Maybe it's a happy memory or a photograph. Maybe it's a person who is also floating. For a while, all you can do is float. Stay alive.\n\nIn the beginning, the waves are 100 feet tall and crash over you without mercy. They come 10 seconds apart and don't even give you time to catch your breath. All you can do is hang on and float. After a while, maybe weeks, maybe months, you'll find the waves are still 100 feet tall, but they come further apart. When they come, they still crash all over you and wipe you out. But in between, you can breathe, you can function. You never know what's going to trigger the grief. It might be a song, a picture, a street intersection, the smell of a cup of coffee. It can be just about anything...and the wave comes crashing. But in between waves, there is life.\n\nSomewhere down the line, and it's different for everybody, you find that the waves are only 80 feet tall. Or 50 feet tall. And while they still come, they come further apart. You can see them coming. An anniversary, a birthday, or Christmas, or landing at O'Hare. You can see it coming, for the most part, and prepare yourself. And when it washes over you, you know that somehow you will, again, come out the other side. Soaking wet, sputtering, still hanging on to some tiny piece of the wreckage, but you'll come out.\n\nTake it from an old guy. The waves never stop coming, and somehow you don't really want them to. But you learn that you'll survive them. And other waves will come. And you'll survive them too. If you're lucky, you'll have lots of scars from lots of loves. And lots of shipwrecks.\"\n\nSource:  [https://www.reddit.com/r/Assistance/comments/hax0t/my\\_friend\\_just\\_died\\_i\\_dont\\_know\\_what\\_to\\_do/c1u0rx2/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Assistance/comments/hax0t/my_friend_just_died_i_dont_know_what_to_do/c1u0rx2/)", "subreddit": "GriefSupport"}

I am frustrated, sad, hopeless and numb all at once. \n\nA year prior to his death, he suffered a near fatal overdose and I remember thinking that this will most definitely wake him up. He will stop using now. He must see he is in serious danger. He never stopped, never seemed to take it seriously and that pissed me off. \n\nThe day before he died I warned him. He was going into surgery to fix damage done to his hands from the previous overdose. Don't use tomorrow, I told him. He said he knew not to because he could die. How much clearer could I have been? I said I loved him, hugged him tight and was prepared for the worst. \n\nAfter surgery, I called my mom to check on him and he had passed. It was the worst day of my life and I still feel sick thinking about it. \n\nI know addiction is hard to understand and that even though I told him, that doesn't mean he was going to stop. I'm grateful for this peace I have in warning him and telling him I love him.

I really had hope that she would get a lung transplant and heal from this. She knew that wouldn\u2019t happen. She kept telling me she felt like she\u2019d be dead in a month and everyone would be shocked. I kept telling her that it was all going to be okay. We would cry together, make morbid sarcastic jokes, plan for the future, and just let all our emotions out. She told me maybe if we grieve together that it would make it easier. I just kept telling her it wasn\u2019t over yet, she had more life to live. She knew the end was near. \n\nI cried a lot the day before she passed, as she was on a breathing tube and ventilator and her body wasn\u2019t syncing with a breathing pattern. I felt terrible bc she didn\u2019t want the tube, and knew she wouldn\u2019t be able to sync up with it.. but I had hope, so she did it for me. \n\nOn tuesday I decided to take the tube out as her body had had enough, and I promised her I would not keep her on a ventilator like that. I cried a little that day, my siblings all came and cried a lot, and I consoled them, and explained the situation. I guess I wanted to be strong, and was stunned out how surreal it all felt. \n\nI laid in the hospital bed with my mom after they took out the tube. She originally wanted me to lay in bed with her when they put the tube in,  but obviously for many reasons that wasn\u2019t a possibility. So I held her, for the last two hours she was alive, and reminded her that it was okay, and to not be afraid. I barely cried bc I didn\u2019t want her to think I was scared or upset (she maybe could have still heard me, though she never woke up) I just cuddled her. At 7:05pm she was pronounced dead and I didn\u2019t leave the bed. I laid with her until they made me get out. I wanted to help them wash her up as I am a CNA, but I didn\u2019t think they would find it appropriate, I wish I would have asked. \n\nI left her body about an hour and a half later, and my boyfriend drove me home. My heart actually hurt. I thought I was going to have a heart attack. I cried for about 20 mins in the car, and that was the last time I cried. I want to so bad, and I feel the tears well up and my throat catch, but nothing will come. It feels like i\u2019m emotionally constipated. Is this a normal part of grief?

That was a bit of a shock for me, and it happened so fast. I received a call early Monday morning around 0200 from the hospital saying that my mother was admitted the night before, and she had to be intubated, but she needed my poa permission to do so. I of course said yes, and went immediately to the hospital to be with her - i also woke up my sister to tell her the news so she can go too since we live together - and she opted to visit after work or on the way to work in the morning (this part *really* annoyed me, because what part of \"mom is in the hospital and she can't breathe\" makes that a 2nd priority? whatever.) That week I had to make all sorts of decisions super fast - funeral arrangements from the hospital morgue to the funeral home, cremate or not, how much $ do we have? how are we paying for this? (fortunately had extended family donors) and what should we do? and lastly.. when should we pull the plug? and by \"we\" i mean \"me\". All of this was me, I did it all, and my sister just sat there giving opinions and offering zero help. \n\nFast forward 40some days to February 19th, my 33rd birthday, I decided to go to Disneyland to just do ***something*** , my friends opted to take me out to help distract me. I get a call around 1400 from my dad's landlord saying that he's been sleeping an extraordinarily long time, so they went to check on him and they think he's dead. I rush to his home and meet with a Sheriff (mind you I was breaking SO MANY LAWS on the way from Disneyland to his final place of residence - about 5 miles westbound) and he told me the news. \n\nSo there you have it, Mom died January 2017, Dad died on my birthday in February 2017. I didn't start to go to group counseling until maybe April at a local church (i'm buddhist but it's open to all, because grief has no prejudices). It really helped, I went every Friday for almost a year. I decided to stop going because I felt I couldn't learn any more from the material and I felt it was time to \"move on\" (remember, moving on does not mean forgetting and letting go. it just means you can start to live your new life without your loved ones in it). \n\nIf you ever need someone to talk to, please don't hesitate to reach out to me, I'm not a licensed therapist or certified in anything, but I'm not inexperienced and hope that I can help in any way shape or form.", "subreddit": "GriefSupport"}

We also love each other very much, but navigating relationship conflicts while having everything else weigh down on me can be extremely tough. On my bad days, I feel as if the universe is too cruel. That it shouldn\u2019t have been me. That I\u2019ve always been a decent person and that the pain of this loss and all these challenges in my life is too much. Sometimes I think about death and how much easier it would be to not have to deal with these emotions. I\u2019m not suicidal. I\u2019m just overwhelmed. I just want to feel connected and loved.

I guess I just need to vent.\n\nHis name was Brian. I met him when we were 14. We bonded over our bad childhoods and depression, and fell in love instantly. Long conversations every day, we were always lifting each other up and watching each other's backs. He helped me gain self-confidence. He thanked me for each meal I ate. Holding him in my arms has always been my favorite thing to do. He was my best friend in the world. He was perfect. \n\nTen years passed. I didn't notice until looking back now, but slowly over time we got too caught up in ourselves to continue lifting up each other. We worked stressful full-time jobs. We were still close, but I didn't worry when he started to drink heavier, I didn't worry when he didn't want to hold me at night. I didn't worry when he didn't want to talk about his feelings so much anymore. I didn't think about it. I grew complacent. \n\nReality hit me like a ton of bricks. Brian committed suicide last Saturday a thousand miles away from anyone, in the front seat of his car. His body wasn't located until last Thursday. I think I was in shock up until the moment I was standing in this small town I didn't want to be in holding onto his ashes. Now I am wishing I had paid more attention. Wishing I had done my job of taking care of this man better. Wishing I could go back and love him harder. \n\nI can't sleep, I can't eat, and I can't think about anything but his smile and his baby blue eyes. I've spent so much of my life with him.. I don't own anything we didn't pick out together, I can't go anywhere without being reminded of him, and he is all I see when I close my eyes. It's just me and his dog, who I am now terrified of losing as well. I don't know what to do. I've already saught counseling, but until that appointment comes I just needed to get these words out. \n\nThere is nothing in the world more selfish than suicide.

We had an existential conversation come up and whenever I bring up hope of life after death he insists that's unhealthy. He's had issues with his religion so he gets sort of touchy whenever that comes up. He said \"you just need to be okay with the possibility that you might not see your loved ones ever again and you might not exist\" and it made me blow up because that implies that I haven't been fucking haunted and plagued by that thought day and night.

My father died this past Wednesday after a long battle with a rare type of cancer. I have been the caregiver in many realms since his diagnosis in 2015. I managed all of the medical affairs etc. although physically my dad was very independent. Until the end, which we had been nearing for a long time..but my dad was a relentless fighter. He finally agreed to home hospice, and I was the caregiver responsible for taking care of him at home. He died just a little over a week later. His physical decline happened so quickly. It was a truly heartbreaking and traumatizing experience to be up so close and personal with his final days as the home hospice caregiver . \n\nMy family and I do not have close relationships at all. If anything, many of them have caused more stress and conflict than anything. I lost my mom in 2008. My dad and his illness have compromised a large majority of my life since his illness began. So he was my person. I have to start my life completely over.  I am currently 30 years old. This started when I was 26.\n\nAlthough today only marked 4 days since losing my dad, I have mostly been in the house by myself since it happened. My good friend was here with me for a few hours afterward. I've tried doing some minor errands. But having been isolated previously, and not having close relationships with anyone in my area or within at least an hour or two drive...I find myself feeling pretty lonely.  I anticipated this would happen, and although I have reached out for support- not many people have come to actually keep me company. I have people to message, text and sometimes have a phone call with. \n\nThis are just the basics. I think people think that grief is contagious or they fear facing the thought of what's behind someone else's grief happening to them. If anyone wants to talk, I'm willing to listen as well. It is a hard process. There are so many changes. I don't want to feel stifled anymore. I've lived in fear and sadness for so long already.

He survived! However, towards the end of May, he decided to shave his head again. He said having hair felt a little weird right now. While doing so, he nicked the port that was on his head from the cancer treatment. It became infected. And by sometime early June, he was admitted to the hospital. He was in ICU for awhile. July 7th, he texted me for the last time. Things will looking up. He was apparently sitting up, drinking, texting, and talking. A day later, he was right back in ICU. He couldn't remember his birthday, phone pass code, or anything like that. The doctors said it was so unexpected. \n\nI'm only 17 years old.. and I suppose I just assumed I had more time with him. It's scary how fast things can change. I miss him more than anything. His room has gifts I bought him scattered everywhere.. just like my room has gifts he bought me everywhere too. He was always there to listen if I needed to talk too. I can't even begin to explain how wonderful he was to me. I am so grateful to be his daughter. I don't know how to cope with the reality that he's gone forever. I try to believe in something spiritual such as the afterlife.. but I think I'm only doing this to make myself feel better when I know the most probable outcome is that nothing happens. And it makes me so upset because he deserved more than this. There was still so much left to do. I wanted to go camping again with him someday, or take him to a hockey game, or do one our 3AM food runs. There was so much left unsaid.", "subreddit": "GriefSupport"}

My mom asked me to say something that she wrote, because she knows that if she tries to give it she will break down crying. My grandpa passed away after a very long battle with Alzheimer\u2019s, and it has been a very difficult journey for my entire family. I\u2019m the oldest of all of my cousins, and the only one with feasible memory of my grandfather before he became too far gone from the dementia, though they are from when I am as young as four. Because of this, I feel as if there is a lot of significance and pressure on me during this process, because along with all of my aunts and uncles, I am one of the people holding his memory. The rest of my younger cousins only know him as he was, while heavily affected by the disease. \n\nIn all honesty, I am terrified. I know my mom thinks I will do well, as I am usually a very composed and structured person, but my grandpa is a very delicate topic for me. It just tears me up inside that I only got a small taste of the great and amazing person I have heard that he was. I know he is someone. Would have loved immensely, and it makes me so sad that the opportunity was ripped away from me, and instead all I truly knew was a shell of that person. I have been crying alone about this for days but it seems ridiculous and silly to explain to my family. \nI\u2019m scared about delivering this eulogy. I can hardly read it without tearing up, and while I know it\u2019s okay to be sad and cry at funerals, I almost feel as if I don\u2019t deserve to get so sad talking about a person I hardly knew. Overall, I\u2019m scared, and I\u2019m sad. I just really wanted to get all of that off of my chest, since lately I don\u2019t feel as if I\u2019ve had anyone to talk to about it.

I have found myself reaching for the phone to call him almost daily. I find myself smiling as I think of something that would make him laugh or get him riled up for a political rant, only to remember he is no longer here. Life has perplexingly, infuriatingly continued as though he were not a necessary part of existence. As though he were not a part of me. I guiltily eat, sleep, work, play, laugh, love and cry, all while desperately shying away from the naked and bleeding  wound in my soul. \n\nI must be the strong one for my family. The hardest words to force out of my mouth to strangers on the phone: \u201cHe has passed away. His future appointments can be cancelled.\u201d Listening to their awkward sympathy while my mouth tastes like tears, words like shards of glass cutting me with the reality over and over again, choking me. I cannot escape this, but I also cannot allow this to overwhelm me because I must be the strong one and do what needs to be done: paperwork filled out, strangers to speak to, inviting them into our grieving lives with horrible intimacy as they work out the arrangements. Things never, ever supposed to be happening to him- he, who was untouchable. He who was a permanent as the land and sky.\n\nBut I must. So I repress, and I become still and sphinxlike, and bury my grief and my mourning while I try and hold life by the scruff of the neck and act as an adult through the routines and traditions and expected details involved with death and the remaining people left behind.\n\nMy fa\u00e7ade is brittle, and the words \u201cI\u2019m sorry for your loss,\u201d and the like hurl themselves at me like bullets. I know this dance, so I bare my teeth in a small smile, soften my eyes and graciously say \u201cThank you,\u201d letting the people go about their way, their duty discharged, relieved. The weight of their words sink in, and with every uttered acknowledgement of loss, I lose him again. I am flayed to the core by the time his celebration of life is complete, numb from the inside out.\n\nAnd so I am back to \u201clife\u201d now; working and reaching out often to immediate family. I cannot give voice to the words that admit he is not there any longer; they flee deep into cracks and crevasses that have opened inside sometime when I wasn\u2019t looking. I am often hit by drive-by memories; some good, some not so good- I drink them like rain because I know if I start unpacking them from my memory, they will unfold like a map and I will never be able to fold them back up into the neatly arranged layers they are in right now.\n\n30 days is somehow the determined amount of time \u201cgranted\u201d by society for grieving. I have managed to find moments that I can steal away and cry until my eyes look bruised, but they are small thunderstorms that bring no relief from the oppressive weight of his loss. His memory and presence sit inside me like a collapsed star, growing heavier and heavier with each breath. It is not so bad, as long as I am not directly acknowledging the fact that I am no longer whole; I never realized that the absence of someone cherished would be such a crushingly heavy loss- a millstone around my neck, and a dread of future holidays. \n\nI am able to steal a little time to cry, to remember, to cherish memories and pictures and silly jokes. It is a bittersweet gift. I can hear his voice in my head and heart. I have recordings of his voice mail messages sitting like ghosts on my computer, but I cannot bring myself to bring them up any more than I can form the words that make me lose him all over again.\n\nI cannot say goodbye.

I'd probably go back a couple of years so I could ask her a few questions and hopefully influence her enough that things would turn out differently. I'd ask her if she knows her status. I'd ask her to get tested, I'd tell her the story of what happened as if it were something that happened to someone else and it would hopefully inspire her to act responsibly. \n\nI've always had a fear of losing someone close to me. Being the kind of person that I am, for years I have had only two people that I considered close to me. I guess I thought that only caring for a few people would protect me from getting hurt. \"People always leave\" was my reasoning. Before this, the few people that have died in my life were people whose deaths shocked me but didn't really affect me much.\n\nI read a lot of books, lots of fiction. I hate reading a story I can predict, I always appreciate a good twist ending. I also tend to gravitate towards people who are mysterious and unpredictable. My mom was always completely predictable. I often knew what she'd say before she could even open her mouth. I knew all her jokes, all her anecdotes, all her life lessons. I knew what she wanted, out of life, at a restaurant, in front of the tv, whatever. We were always so close that I suppose I got cocky and truly believed that I knew everything about her that I needed to know. I also assumed that if there was anything new, I would be the first or among the first to know, naturally.\n\nShe was a devout Christian. One of her favorite bible stories was the story of Job. Whenever she was sick, she'd place a hand over where it hurt, and she'd feel better. She'd even try doing that with the rest of the family, but we weren't \"faithful enough\" for the healing to work. In spite of the praying, she still bought medication, she still used medication and she would sometimes put her hands over the pills or medicine and pray for the Lord to work through them.\n\nIn April when I came back home after a few months, I remember realizing that she'd lost some weight and that she looked somewhat older. But I assumed it had something to do with stress or that she was on another one of those diets of hers. A few weeks later she suddenly told me that she'd been mentally preparing herself before meals and forcing the food down her throat because for weeks food had been tasting like toilet paper. I asked her to go to the doctor but she told me no, she would pray for it and she'd be healed. I didn't pester her too much  because at the time it sounded like just the flu, or just some stomach bug. \n\nShe got worse over the weeks, and she revealed to me that a while ago, she'd made a decision to stop using medicine. \"If I take medication on top of praying, then that means I don't actually trust the Lord to heal me. It means I think that whatever I have is stronger than the Lord. Or that the medication is stronger than the Lord. Then how can I call myself a true believer?\" She had white patches on her tongue, her face was gaunt, she was shaking a lot of the time. She spent most of her time in her room. I could see she wasn't getting better and I worried, so I begged and  nagged and even guilt tripped her to get her to see a doctor. But she saw through all my tactics and just told me that she was involved in a spiritual war that I wouldn't understand because I'm only a kid and I don't have her kind of faith. I called her brother and he also begged and nagged her to see a doctor. I invited her church elders to see her and talk to her and hopefully make her see I wasn't trying to turn her against God, that she really needed to see someone. Mom listened to nobody, she told everyone not worry because she was already healed, and if anyone said otherwise she wrote them off as not being faithful enough. \n\nI sometimes wonder what if I'd called an ambulance sooner. At the time I always imagined she would resist the paramedics instructions. She was paranoid and hostile. But what if the paramedics would have taken her regardless...would it have helped? \n\nShe was admitted on the 19th of June, and on the the 25th of June my uncle called me and told me that my mother's doctor had a diagnosis and that she wanted to see me. He told me they'd performed a spinal tap because they suspected either TB or cancer. That evening, I hoped and prayed it was TB, and for some reason I cut my arm and told myself that if I drew enough blood then mom would be okay. The next day before I could see the doctor, my uncle told me mom had TB! I was so relieved, because I've known at least two people before mom who had been hospitalized for TB and turned out alright in the end. Then the doctor called us into her office and instead of repeating what my uncle said, she asked me \"what do you understand about being HIV positive?\" \n\nMy mom was a biology teacher, and everything I ever knew about health and diseases and even HIV itself was from her lessons. Not only did I have no clue until then that she had it, but in May when I tried looking up her symptoms and those doctor sites would suggest a whole lot of possible illnesses including HIV, I would always skip right over the HIV. Maybe I assumed that if she had it, then she surely would have told me, and I surely would have seen her take treatment? My intelligent and educated mother, that health freak, the woman who taught me and my brother and everyone else who would listen all about germs and bacteria and viruses and how diseases happen.....? There are so many ads on TV about HIV and prevention and treatment, and every time those ads would play she would go on about how terrible that people in South Africa are still getting infected with it in spite of all the efforts to educate people about it. She would go on about people not getting tested and not taking their treatment... It's so confusing. She had it? So I start asking myself where and when did she get it? All of the questions that I have asked myself from that day onwards, that I wish I could travel back in time to ask her... It doesn't even matter that she had it. But why didn't she get tested? Or maybe she did? But then if she did, doesn't that mean she committed suicide by willfully not taking medication for the HIV even though she understood perfectly well how the illness works?\n\nSo mom had HIV AND TB, and to complicate things, her TB was drug-resistant. The last time I saw her was on her birthday, she was in hospital and it was after they'd explained to me what was happening to her. I'd been trying to be optimistic even after the news, reading up on HIV and TB and watching YouTube videos about people who had recovered and went on to live full lives after being infected. I even read up on stuff I'd need to know so that I could take care of her when she came back home from the hospital, the type of medication I'd need to make sure she was taking, and trying to figure out which strategies I'd use to get her to take her medication this time. On her birthday, I bought her a PS with 'happy birthday' on it and some orange juice, and when I saw her her eyes were really yellow, the sores around her mouth were much worse, she wasn't eating and she didn't say one word. I assumed she was in pain and that's why she couldn't speak, and since she had trouble hearing I decided to write her a message on my phone and show it to her. I swear I saw some expression in her eyes when she read it, some sadness. I could not stop crying after that visit. I've been crying a lot, even before she passed away, I Googled it then and the internet calls it 'anticipatory grief' which I found morbid  because at the time I didn't think I was justified in thinking she was dying.\n\nIt's been almost a month since she died now and it's been the most difficult emotional experience of my life. The pain... seems to be getting better. I have so many questions though. Everyday when I wake up, I never know what to expect. Sometimes I wake up, and I feel confused, and my brain refuses to believe she's gone so I have to remind myself of everything that has happened from the moment I realized she was sick, all the way until her death and of all the stuff that happened after her death. Then I look around and I see small but powerful pieces of evidence that it wasn't all a dream, her open bedroom door in the middle of the night, the sad songs about grief in my playlist , the scars on my arm. Sometimes I wake up feeling angry at everyone, blaming everyone, including me and including her, for her death... Sometimes I wake up feeling nothing at all... Sometimes I wake up feeling so sad and I cry and cry and cry, and I miss her so much. Some days I feel almost perfectly fine, I feel like I remember everything that's happened and that while I'm sad about it, that I'll be okay. I wish more days would be like that. On most days I spend half my time thinking and thinking about her and all of the things that happened and how things could have happened differently, and the half of my time trying not to think and keeping myself very busy. Sometimes I can't avoid thinking at all so I keep myself busy by writing about what I'm going through.", "subreddit": "GriefSupport"}

Just want to share my story.\n\nI'm 32(f).\n\nThe deaths:  \nPaternal grandpa - 1994, expected, cancer, aged 65  \nUncle, 2000, expected, cancer, aged 53  \nMom - 2002, unexpected, brain aneurysm, aged 39  \nUncle, 2007, unexpected, motorcycle accident, aged 49  \nAunt, 2007, expected, cancer, aged 56  \nPaternal grandma, 2017, not surprising, complications with a broken hip and blood thinners, 83  \nMaternal grandpa, 2017, not surprising, parkinson's disease, 85\n\nEven though I was close with all these people, the only one I remember crying over was my mother. That was the worst time of my entire life.\n\nBut I even felt that there was something wrong with me when both my grandparents died in 2017 and I didn't cry. My grandma and I were extremely close. I didn't cry when I heard she passed, but about three weeks before her death, my father explained that she was feeling suicidal, wanted to die, etc.. and that we (the grandkids) should call her. I called her on her cell while she was in the hospital. She answered, seeming confused. I tried talking to her, and at some point she recognized me because she said my name. She said, \"\\[Name!!!\\], please help me! They're keeping me here against my will! Help me!\" I tried to talk to her more but she wouldn't respond. I heard a nurse (I assume) ask who was on the line and she said, \"it's my granddaughter\". There were some muffled sounds and then the line went dead. I cried and cried and cried.\n\nI know her confusion was her medication, but it really got to me.\n\nAbout a week before my mom passed away unexpectedly, I had a dream that she died. I woke up thinking about how awful it was and that I'd never be able to go on if that happened. Well, it happened, and I somehow went on.\n\nMore recently, I'm becoming more and more terrified that someone else close to me is going to die. Like my father, my step mom, any of my five siblings, or my nieces and nephews. Even my husband. I think about how I wouldn't be able to survive. I even think that if I don't do or say something, my husband will die. \n\nSometimes my heart hurts for the death of my husband, or my nephew, or my father, even though those things haven't happened. Sometimes it overwhelms me. I wonder how I could have a child and not worry about their safety and health 24/7.", "subreddit": "GriefSupport"}

I wondered what could have caused my mom to cry because she rarely cries. \n\nI was worried and walked to the office when my mom tells me my friend had just died. Heatstroke, that was what took my friend from me. Her insides had fried from 108 degrees on a hike and had to be airlifted to a hospital. She was in the ICU for a long time but by then it was too late. She had died of a heart attack this morning at 2:45am. \n\nThe worst thing for me is that I was rekindling a friendship from childhood. I used to know her when we were in elementary school and were close then. In middle school to high school we went separate ways until I saw her back in the summer of 2017 and kept in touch since. I last saw her 2 weeks ago and went shopping together and caught up. I honestly can\u2019t believe this happened to a 20 year old girl, my own age. She was going towards the prime of her life, she loved life. She was energetic and vivacious and spunky. I won\u2019t ever forget the time we had together, the memories we shared. \n\nI wish I could have gotten to know her better. And I know she\u2019s in no more pain, but I hope she is in a better place. Elizabeth, I will miss you for the rest of my life, and I will better myself even more and look to new adventures in my own life.", "subreddit": "GriefSupport"}

The basic facts are I lost my mom suddenly to a car accident. She was 81, accident was not her fault. She did everything she should/could do to avoid it. \n\nI don't feel like I am human anymore. I have trouble relating to those around me. People say I am handling things well but truth be told I am lost. I am numb most of the time and can't cry. There are so many things that have to be done and I can't face half of them right now. I am angry sometimes, but I don't feel like I am grieving like I did when my dad passed. I feel like I am struggling in other ways. I have a daughter that I didn't have when Dad passed and maybe that's why? I don't know really what I am looking for, I just feel like I need to talk but I can't to those around me.", "subreddit": "GriefSupport"}
