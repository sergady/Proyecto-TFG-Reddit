The nurses at the animal hospital didn't know what was wrong with her brain, and the only way to find out was for her to get a ct scan, but we didn't have enough money to be able to do that. The only choice we had was to put her down. My mum was heartbroken and cryed all night, and even talked about Skye in her sleep. When we went back to the animal hospital we were given time to talk to Skye before she was put down, but she wasn't herself. She could barely get up and made little whimpering sounds. After about half an hour the nurse came in with the needle and I stroked her paw, while my mum and sister sobbed. It only took about 20 seconds before she stopped breathing, and she just layed there. We are going to get her cremated but every time I think of her I want to cry. And i regret not spending enough time with her. I hardly ever even  played fetch with her and didn't give her enough attention. How do I move past her death?\n\nEdit: Just came back from the vet where we dropped her off to get cremated. After spending most of yesterday crying I think it definitely helped but I think it will still be a long time before I can think of her without crying. Thank you to all of you that commented as well, and to everyone else that recently had their dog or any pet leave them I hope you guys can get past it and look back on all the good memories you had with them.", "subreddit": "GriefSupport"}

Then I came home and cried. All the time.  After 6 weeks, my husband asked me to go to therapy, so I did.  It helped at first- b/c She gave me assurances to pass along that my grief was ok. It didn't actually help my grief.\n\nThen, I had time off work, and I know that when I'm not working, I drown in sadness, and folks say that's not ok. So, I booked myself up, committed to several projects/causes. I've always been community service oriented,  but I went into hyper-service mode. I started  a nonprofit, a scholarship in his name, a whole teen-internship program,  built  MORE community service into my life- including a part-time job serving the community, with the salary funneled directly into the nonprofit.\n\nMy friends, therapist, everyone...they see me doing this, and it's evidence that I'm ok.

{"post_id": "ablsu6", "created_utc": 1546375542, "title": "Oatmeal", "author": "MrFahrenheit_451", "self_text": "\"Would you like some oatmeal?\"  Dad stood in the kitchen, looking over at me.  I was sitting in the family room, looking back at him, his charcoal grey former work pants, held up with that brown belt he\u2019d worn since my uncle gave it to him back in 1980.  Dad was wearing his trademark grey former electric company work shirt, the patch identifying him as a worker long since removed.\n\nDad got a uniform budget from work.  I don\u2019t know the specifics, but it was far more than he needed, and so all of the extras became home clothes for him -bum around the house, clothes, you might call them.  Dad was wearing these same clothes as far back as I can ever remember.  Back when I was a year old and we sat outside a gold mine in Deadwood, SD, while mom and my brother and sister went and checked it out.  Back when he came to visit me at daycare in that old school, because he was reading the meters in the school that day.  Back when he rushed downstairs, to fight the fire I started in the basement with a lighter my brother had so kindly lent me, a 4 year old, with access to cardboard.  \n\nBack when he came to get me from my friend Matthew, who lived down the street from me, so that we could go grocery shopping, but those plans never happened.  I called out to him \u201cI\u2019ll race you home\u201d, which was one of the first and last times I tried to be fun and competitive with my dad.  He sped off on that 10 speed bicycle and didn\u2019t see all of the sand on the road at the corner, and fell sideways and hit his head on the pavement.  That hurt, so much.  A neighbor saw what happened, and came out with paper towels, my dad\u2019s face all bloody and broken.  Dad held it there while riding the bike home, I still can remember to this day seeing his back while we rode home, him in utter pain and bleeding, me in utter guilt and silence.  He was wearing charcoal grey.\n\nTurns out dad had broken his cheekbone.  We sat in the ER for hours waiting for a diagnosis.  I\u2019d never seen dad cry before that.  Oh wait, yes I had.  A fateful Sunday afternoon, when dad had been lying down because he wasn\u2019t feeling good, the phone rang.  Between tears and a soar throat, he shouted \u201cmy dad\u2019s gone!\u201d.  It wasn\u2019t expected, grandpa died of a sudden heart attack.  I don\u2019t remember much of that week, dad going out to Steinbach to pick out a casket and help his brothers and sisters plan the service.  It was an example of how words could hurt, physically hurt, like when I said \u201cI\u2019ll race you\u201d and dad got hurt.  I\u2019ve always regretted saying those three words.\n\nDad was wearing charcoal grey the afternoon he was trying to get the lawnmower started, and instead started the lawnmower and grass on fire.  Good thing the garden hose was nearby.  Dad always told me, don\u2019t play with water, turns out he was right, he needed it that afternoon to put the fire out.  At least he did get the lawnmower working.  We didn\u2019t have the money to buy another one.  Dad always made the money reach, being born and raised in the 1930\u2019s when there was nothing to buy, and no money to buy it with -to quote \u2018To Kill a Mockingbird\u2019.\n\nDad would have been wearing charcoal grey that day he was called into his supervisors\u2019 office and told \u2018we can\u2019t have a blind man reading meters here\u2019 and he was forced to retired.  That hit dad hard, really hard.  Dad would go into the office after that day, several times, because he had over a year of severance and sick days to use up, and he would photocopy songs and Bible verses for the tv show mom and dad had.  I remember going in with dad one time, and the boss saying to him \u201cyou don\u2019t work here anymore, Henry, what are you doing here?\u201d  My dad, prepared in advance, pulled out his pay stub from severance pay and said, I\u2019m still on the payroll.  Boss said \u201cthat photocopier is for company use only, Henry\u201d to which he replied, everyone here uses the photocopier for personal use, if you want to stop me, then stop them from using it, too.  The boss was defeated.  He was a jerk, anyway, he deserved it, if not, more.\n\nDad went on to play Tetris in his spare time, and got record numbers higher than I could even get.  I have no idea how a half blind man could get 180,000 points in Tetris, sometimes more.    Yes, dad wore his charcoal greys playing Tetris.\n\nSo, as I sat there, looking at dad, thinking about all of these things, almost all at once, and then I said, yes, please, can you make me some oatmeal.\n\nThe final chapter of 2018 has closed.  An entire year, past, in the blink of an eye.  2018 finished what 2017 started, the first of many firsts.  New Year\u2019s 2017 came and seemingly within minutes February 5 came, and the death of my own dad reported to me.  I then knew what he had felt that fateful afternoon when his own dad had passed.  2017 was a year of firsts without dad, but 2018 was also a first.  The first entire complete year without dad.  What\u2019s it like?  Have you seen \u2018Cast Away\u2019?\n\nSo, as I start 2019, on this day, I eat oatmeal for breakfast.  And I remember all of the charcoal greys.\n", "subreddit": "GriefSupport"}

I'll start at the beginning.\n2005 when my 1st child was 18 months old my mum decided to move 6 hours away to be with a guy.  This was a bit of a shock as we'd always been close.  As time went on we stayed in contact regularly,  she visited once or twice a year.  Turns out her partner was emotionally abusive.  He called her horrible names \"in jest\" controlled her money etc.  \n\nAnyway fast forward to 2009 and she was diagnosed with terminal lung cancer and given days to live.  Naturally my family and I (nan, brother, uncle and cousins) all drove down to see her.  She was still lucid most of the time and we begged her to be transferred nearer to us (the hospital agreed they could so this) but she wanted to stay close to her partner and his family (whom she disliked)  Turns out she was a fighter and lasted another month, in which we returned home and I went back down with just my nan and my children so she could see them one last time.\n\nHer partner agreed that when the time came for her to pass that he would contact us and book us a flight down (1hr compared to 6 to our drive, and he had loads of money whereas we were struggling esp as we'd had to make 2 trips down in a month) \n\nSo one Sunday morning I accidentally turned my phone's signal off (thought it was wifi) and this was when my mum passed.  Her partner had tried to ring my mobile, but obviously couldn't get through, so instead of ringing my landline, or any of my other relative's phone's.  He put a Facebook status on her account that she had passed, and that's how I found out my mum had died.  My cousin (not one of those that came with us) and best friend found out before me and sent me messages of condolence.  I was like wtf,  she's still alive? Then saw the status. \n\nThen at the funeral (down there) her partner made no mention of my brother in the eulogy (they didn't get on) which was just the icing on the cake. \n\nNow although I'm furious at her partner, a part of me is also angry at her too.  \n1, for smoking at all when I'd begged her since I was small to stop.\n2, for putting him and his family before us and not transferring closer which meant I never got to say goodbye.\n\nI can't afford therapy so mostly try to repress all this (never speak of it aloud) but I really needed to get it off my chest, and hopefully it will help me if anyone has any input/help/wisdom.\nThanks for reading.", "subreddit": "GriefSupport"}

She was a pilot, an author, an artist, and she ran her own lemon orchard out of her backyard. She was also very politically active, writing to people like Hillary Clinton and Dr. Ford, sometimes receiving letters back. I run a chapter of an international political movement because she made me feel like I could change the world if I wanted to. She always supported me, sometimes more than my own family. I love baking and every time I brought over a slice of cake she\u2019d react like it was the best gift in the world. \n\nI\u2019m 18 and I\u2019ve been friends with her since I was around 5 or 6. When I was 9 she released her first book and I did a voice for one of the characters on the app for the book. 2 years ago she hired me to work for the lemon orchard. It was my first job and I loved it. I worked once a week and every time I came over she\u2019d greet me with a glass of homemade pomegranate lemonade. She had a poodle named Lucy that would bark her head off if anyone set foot on their property but she was a sweetheart and would lick your hands to death when you got close to her. I had chickens and she loved the eggs I\u2019d bring over. I remember when I was in 6th grade and my first chicken laid its first egg, I brought it over to show her. \n\nIn November, Lucy passed away. A few weeks later, she opened the website for the orchard for orders. The week before my first day, she told me she was closing the orchard due to sudden medical news. When I came in for work, she gave me a glass of hot chocolate and sat me down. She had cancer. Multiple kinds. Brain, bone, lung, etc. She told me she\u2019d lived a full life and she wouldn\u2019t be upset if this is what takes her out. I spent the day refunding orders and before I left I signed some legal documents as a witness that allowed her husband to make medical decisions.\n\nThree weeks later, last Saturday, she died.\n\nI miss her so much. The day I found out (Monday), I went over to my neighbors\u2019 house (they\u2019re my age and their parents weren\u2019t home) and got drunk for the first time. Last night I stayed up until 5am just sobbing on the phone with my friend. It\u2019s currently 3am and I can\u2019t stop crying. If I\u2019m alone, I break down. I didn\u2019t get to say a real goodby to her and it\u2019s tearing me up. I was going to make her favorite cake for New Year\u2019s and tell her how much she meant but I was too late. She was like a parent to me and I don\u2019t know what to do. I\u2019m just a wreck. \n\nAny advice or support would be greatly appreciated. Thank you", "subreddit": "GriefSupport"}

How could you do this to our family? I'm so angry at you I don't know what to do. You cried to your friends about how no one cared about you when you knew they did, you knew that your family did, and so many others. You complained about how abandoned you felt, but then you abandoned everyone who loved you, and you ruined them. Your grandmother cries every day, even though it's been over 2 months. Your pain has multiplied infinitely and spread through this family like a virus from your one single act. Your father almost joined you on Thanksgiving day, and I had to text 911, terrified for his life, and spent the day talking to doctors while he threw his wedding ring at me and demanded a divorce for not letting him. We only worked through this after he was heavily medicated, and he's still drugged out on prescriptions. Your brothers are lost without you. Do you know how royally messed up everything is now? Are you sorry at all? \n\nAt the same time, I know you couldn't have planned this. This must have been in the heat of the moment. Every time you had boy issues, you went to this. Any other problem, any other kind of rejection, you could let it roll off your back and go on with your life, but not breakups. This could have been fixed so easily. Your dad and I both have been in this situation where we felt like the world was ending and that we couldn't live without the person we were seeing. But look what happened after all the breakups you did survive; you met someone else and they quickly became your world. You didn't even get to know what a good boyfriend was. I know you'd like to argue that Josh was a good boyfriend, but as a parent, I can't accept that. He broke your heart countless amounts of times when he knew how you felt about him, and yet he kept getting back with you just to mess around with other girls, make reasons not to see you, and then when he couldn't get what he wanted elsewhere, he came crawling back to you. We tried to warn you about him, but that just drove you into his arms more, so we backed off. You were an adult, and we had to let you make your own decisions. I should be angrier at him, but you chose this.\n\nBut back to my point: you left no note. You didn't say goodbye to anyone. Were you planning on being found again, and they found you too late? Why did you lock the door this time? Where did you go in the 6 hours of no activity on your phone outside your dorm? I have so many questions I'll never have the answer to, and now I'm just stuck cleaning up your mess. I'm stuck paying for this expensive apartment that we had to move into because you didn't want to live with your mother any more but wanted to graduate with your friends, only for this to happen. I'm stuck trying to fix our financial situation because it's expensive to fly a dead body across from 6 states away, hold a funeral, and have a cremation. I'm so damn hungry, but the thought of food just makes me want to cry because I feel like it's a waste of money we don't have. \n\nHow am I supposed to take care of your father, your brothers, or anyone else suffering this loss when I'm such a wreck myself? Knowing that you took your life in that college dorm shower, and having to drive for 14 hours to clean it out, I barely can muster up enough will to go into my own bathroom once a week to clean myself or brush my teeth.\n\nI love you but I'm so mad at you. I am so incomprehensibly mad at you. You were beautiful, you had a family who supported you and would have helped you, you had the most beautiful voice that I can only listen to recordings of, you had talent whether it was playing the violin or the artistic masterpieces you made. And you were brilliantly smart. And now you're in a leaky plastic bag in a box on my dining room table. ", "subreddit": "GriefSupport"}

After mourning for three months and seeking treatment for diagnosed depression, I was back at a new job. However, at the time she said that she felt lonely and that I was distant to her. In the following years we worked to try and mend our relationship but she would always come back to saying that things changed those months after my father\u2019s death. \n\nWhat more can life do to me?

From what I can gather, she had an undiagnosed brain tumor and, one day, just collapsed at work and never woke up. The details of her death, and her life, are lost to me. I'm sure at one point, my dad and my extended family told me something but I was too young to really remember, and it was never repeated as I grew up.\n\nFast forward 20 years and most of my extended family have also passed away. My grandparents died within a few years of each other when I was in my teens. I was close to them, particularly my grandad, but neither of them spoke much about my mother. Her death hit everybody very hard, especially my grandad. He even lived separately from my nana, in a house across the street, even though they were still married and very much in love. Growing up, they were supportive in their own ways but not very expressive with their emotions. I was always scared to ask about my mum.\n\nMy dad is a whole other issue. He's very emotionally closed off and prefers not to talk about important things. The most I've gleaned about my mother from him are stories about when they met, places they've been etc. In recent years, I thought our relationship was damaged beyond repair. From the ages of 8 to 18, I was subjected to emotional abuse from his partner. He did not know the extent of it and, as such, didn't address it or stand up for me. This is something we are only both just coming to terms with and seeking therapy for. I already engage in individual therapy for severe anxiety, PTSD and depression brought on by my experiences.\n\nBut, even with therapy and our tentative new father-daughter relationship, I'm still finding it difficult to talk to him about my mum. It has only hit me recently, after addressing my mental health issues, that I never really allowed myself to grieve properly. I just accepted that she was gone and tried not to think about her. Coming from a family that didn't discuss our emotions has been damaging for me and is something I'm tackling with my therapist. I really want to know my mum, and I'm ready to properly immerse myself in the grieving process. I need advice, preferably from people who have lost a mother.

He had a brief stint with drug use about 6 years ago, but got clean and then didn\u2019t use for those 6 years until he relapsed in February when their father died. My fianc\u00e9 and his brother were very close, despite him living a few states away. My fianc\u00e9 feels guilty about not going to visit him often enough, or being aware of the drug habit. We knew he relapsed after their father\u2019s death, but thought it was a one off occurrence and believed it was under control. This has been incredibly difficult for my fianc\u00e9, and he\u2019s been in varying states of depression since his death. I don\u2019t know how to help him, and have never experienced the loss of someone that close to me so I can\u2019t even really begin to fathom what he is feeling or figure out how to help him grieve. My heart breaks for him and his family and I feel totally useless in the whole situation. \n\nAlso in April, I discovered that a trusted person at my job (a business owned by my father that I am planned to take over in the next few years), was embezzling an incredibly large amount of money and very nearly bankrupt us. I\u2019ve spent the better part of a year ripping apart financial data at work spanning years and trying to clean up the mess. Currently, it appears as though our business has a decent chance of surviving, though I was unsure of that for a while. This created a huge amount of stress for me as I\u2019m not sure what I will do if the business goes under and I need to find an entirely new career, not to mention how it would affect my father who has more or less sunk his life savings into it. Needless to say I\u2019ve been working my ass off trying to make sure that that doesn\u2019t become a reality for us, but I\u2019m kind of the only one doing so because my dad\u2019s pretty beat up about the whole thing. This is an enormous weight I\u2019m holding because I feel like if I don\u2019t fix it, it won\u2019t get fixed and there\u2019s a lot at stake for not only me but a lot of other people that I care about. \n\nAgain in April (April fucking sucked), I was working at my part time bar tending job on a Friday night, when a patron who was extremely drunk and out of control was punching holes in the bathroom wall and starting fights with other people. My boss was there along with my fianc\u00e9, and my boss asked my fianc\u00e9 to ask the person to leave, which he did. The person began a physical altercation with my fianc\u00e9, who struck the person in the face one time and fractured his jaw and knocked out three teeth. A few days later, said person filed charges against my fianc\u00e9. He was charged with second degree aggravated assault due to the nature of the person\u2019s injuries, but was dropped down to a misdemeanor and he received 3 years of probation \u2013 he was just sentenced a few weeks ago. He will be suing us civilly in the future, I\u2019m sure. I took on a third job right after this happened to try to gain some more income for legal expenses, which I just recently quit because I was spreading myself way too thin and couldn\u2019t maintain it any longer.\n\nThen, in June, our house flooded, resulting in a mold problem and ensuing insurance company battle that is still going on currently. 80% of our belongings were ruined and discarded, with 10% currently in storage, and 10% with us now. We rent our apartment from my mother who owns the home, and were living in the downstairs section, which is gutted right now and currently has nothing in it. We are currently living in the upstairs portion of the home while my mom is staying at her husband\u2019s home with whom she is separated and has been for the past 6 months since the flood. \n\nWhen my fianc\u00e9s brother passed away, we adopted his dog who is a fairly large breed. Before that, we already had two large dogs, a small dog, and a cat. Prior to the flood, our five animals had free range of the house both upstairs and downstairs so it wasn\u2019t as chaotic as it sounds. Now my fianc\u00e9, his son, myself, and our 5 animals have been living in a 1000 square foot space for the past six months, which is *exactly* as chaotic as it sounds. \n\nMy mom has owned the home for 30 years, so the upstairs portion and any storage space had 30 years of stuff in it. So not only are we sharing the space with three people and five animals, we also have all of my mom\u2019s things as well as what\u2019s left of ours. I\u2019ve spent just about every available moment after work and on weekends cleaning out and organizing every cabinet, closet, and drawer so that we can have some semblance of a habitable living space. This was also necessary because we had to have mold remediation completed, and they needed access to every crevice of the home to accomplish that, but not without first charging us $11,000.00. \n\nDealing with the insurance company has been a nightmare, and we have been in negotiations with them for about 7 months now. They have paid us out for the \u201cRebuild\u201d portion of our claim, but we had to wait until mold remediation was completed before we could start doing any construction. That was just finished recently so we\u2019ve finally begun to frame out our home. For the \u201cContents\u201d portion of the claim, they want photographs of every damaged item, as well as either receipts for purchase of said items (which we obviously don\u2019t have), or a comparable product online with pricing information. We\u2019ve documented and cataloged everything and done all of that, but they must first approve it before we can remove the contents from our property. Consequently, we\u2019ve had a dumpster filled with our entire life in our front yard for the better part of a year. \n\nFor the \u201cAdditional Living Expenses\u201d portion, they want every receipt for every purchase we\u2019ve made for everything, along with three months of financial records from prior to the flood for comparison. I\u2019ve done that too, and have been sorting through a year\u2019s worth of credit card, utility bills, and bank account activity and organizing it so that they can review it. It is literally a full time job dealing with an insurance claim, and I don\u2019t wish it on anyone. We\u2019ve exhausted our finances throughout this thing \u2013 and honestly weren\u2019t in all that great of shape to begin with.  \n\nMy relationship with my fianc\u00e9 is really struggling. All of this has taken a massive toll on us, and we\u2019re both pretty miserable. He\u2019s dealing with the loss of virtually his entire family, which I don\u2019t even have the slightest clue how to help him handle. I\u2019m trying to just be there for him but it\u2019s getting really hard for me and I don\u2019t really know what to do. He\u2019s been out of work for a month and a half right now. He\u2019s in the construction industry and wanted to take off to build the house, but we\u2019re hung up on the insurance issues so he has only been able to do a small amount of work, and hasn\u2019t gotten anything done in about a month now. He spends a lot of time playing video games and sleeping, as it\u2019s an escape from his reality. He has crippling anxiety and is depressed, and has trouble just doing day to day activities. He still does some stuff, and will pick up around the house and make dinner occasionally but I\u2019m 100% taking the brunt of our obligations and he doesn\u2019t seem to see it that way, though sometimes will admit that he knows he hasn\u2019t been doing the things he needs to do. He refuses to seek therapy or any healthy way of coping despite my repeated attempts to get him to talk to someone and seek out help. I actually got him to go to one counseling session a few months back which he actually said was great and was looking forward to feeling better after talking to her, but he never went back. I\u2019ve tried to explain that I am here for him and always will be and we are going to get through this, but at the same time the world is still turning and we need to do the things we need to do to move on or at least take positive steps in the right direction. I\u2019ve been doing my best to hold everything together for us and his son, and am running myself ragged trying to balance and coordinate and orchestrate three lives, navigate this insurance claim so we can get our house back, and dig my family\u2019s business out of a sinking hole, among other bullshit that keeps getting thrown on our plate. \n\nWe fight constantly and I realize how terrible this probably sounds but I don't know how much longer I can maintain this. I recently ended up in the hospital because I was having problems with my vision and couldn\u2019t see straight and had crazy vertigo for a few days. After multiple doctors\u2019 visits, I was told it was stress and anxiety related. I am a tough person and always thought I could handle anything thrown at me no matter how much or how hard but that situation kind of put it in perspective that everybody has a limit on how much they can handle - and I\u2019m clearly maxed the fuck out. I didn\u2019t even realize how bad it was until it started *physically* affecting me. I didn\u2019t even know stress could do that to a person. This is all just taking such a toll on me and I know that I can\u2019t continue like this because I feel like I\u2019m honestly going to have a mental breakdown soon if shit doesn\u2019t let up. I need his *help* and I can\u2019t do it all on my own and I don\u2019t know how much longer I can carry out this balancing act.  But I also realize that he feels 1000x worse than I do at the same time, so then I just feel guilty for even feeling this way. And then I read posts in this group and just feel like a total piece of shit for even considering myself in this situation and I just don\u2019t know how to move forward. Grieving doesn\u2019t have a set timeline or end point, and I don\u2019t know how long it\u2019ll be before he is functioning normally again if ever, which is completely fine and I understand and accept that fact and know that its a long road and we're just at the beginning of it. But at the same time I need to know that he\u2019s at least taking *some kind* of step in a positive direction and seeking a way out of this. If not I just feel like he's just on a downward spiral and I'm trying to see us through but I don't know how long I can mentally and physically keep this up. I don\u2019t know if I\u2019m being selfish or not empathizing enough, and I\u2019m painfully aware that I truly can\u2019t fathom what he is going through. \n\nMy heart is truly broken for him and I know that this has got to be the most difficult thing that he's ever dealt with and I couldn't even begin to comprehend what it's like. I'm trying so hard to just be there and listen and to help him through it and maintain everything for us. \n\nI don\u2019t know what I can do to help or how I can ease his pain but what I do know is that if I continue to not take care of me, I can\u2019t take care of them either so this is what I am struggling with. I told him this morning after another all night stint of Xbox that I didn\u2019t need him to conquer the world I just needed him to take out the garbage and that has led to another fight, and it\u2019s 6 o\u2019clock on Friday night and I\u2019m at work at my desk typing this because I don\u2019t want to go home and don\u2019t really know what to do with myself right now.\n\nI don\u2019t even know why I\u2019m writing all of this I think I just need to get it out maybe. I guess I'm trying to write a post seeking advice on how to help a grieving spouse with their loss and ask how other people dealt with taking on all the responsibility, or if anyone has been in a similar situation during a difficult time but this kind of spiraled for me.. But if anyone has any advice on that topic I\u2019d be grateful for it. I\u2019m trying to be optimistic and patient and just hope this year is better and hope that I can maintain and see us through this without losing my shit in the process.

I still remember the night that my mother found out and woke me up to let me know he was gone. At first I felt nothing, I was half asleep and not processing the news, but the moment my mother broke down in my arms was the moment I realized what truly happened. My brother had been in prison for eight out of his ten year sentence at that point. I was only six when he got locked up and therefor lived my whole life without him in it. It felt like I never even him, yet I missed him badly and I grew up counting the years until he could come home again. But at some point in prison he got raped by an hiv+ inmate and of course got infected as well. He was so ashamed of everything that he never told anybody, which meant he had no money for treatment that could have saved his life. He suffered alone, in shame, without anyone having any clue. The first year after he passed I didn\u2019t know what to feel since he hadn\u2019t been present in my life and I had no memory of him, which led to me feeling like I wasn\u2019t allowed to mourn someone I never had any memories of to look back on, whilst everyone else was highly affected. I felt this way for two more years, unable to truly mourn a stranger, until I saw his picture and broke down. It finally hit me that this brother of mine didn\u2019t get to and will never see me grow up and I would never be able to form a relationship with him. It kills me that he\u2019s gone and I truly miss him and wish I could meet him again, but part of me still feels wrong for mourning him and I have no idea how to cope with this. It hurts me and I feel confused yet heartbroken. What do I do? How should I handle his loss when I feel like I\u2019m not allowed to grieve someone I never knew?", "subreddit": "GriefSupport"}

He wasn't perfect and never tried to be, and he found his own perfection in that. At his visitation, I got to see all of these people, and each one of them talked about the special relationship they had with him and how special he made them feel. That was his gift. He could make you feel capable of anything.\n\nThings like that made the immediate aftermath of his death a little bit more bearable. Plus the world got to be put on pause for a little bit. I was hurting, but that's how I was 'supposed' to feel (I realize there's no real way you're supposed to feel when grieving, I mean in the sense that it makes sense that losing someone would make you hurt, thus that would be how you're 'supposed' to feel). \n\nNow I'm 6 weeks out. I had the holiday break at my school which also meant I had a lot of time off of work, as I work at my university. I was hoping to feel at least a bit re-energized after all of this, but I feel the opposite. The holidays were a stress-fest. I decided to take a vacation for New Years that wound up with me having my wallet stolen and nearly being unable to get home. Having my wallet stolen caused my mom and I to get into a fight which triggered a pretty hefty breakdown on my part. I came very close to checking myself into a hospital because of how afraid I was. That is genuinely the most terrified I've ever been. In all the chaos, I hadn't registered for the upcoming semester which starts on Monday. I went to register for classes and found out that I am on academic suspension due to poor grades last semester because my grades took a nosedive after all of this happened. The deadline to appeal the suspension was Friday, so I will have to sit out a semester. In addition, I am unsure if I am able to keep my job if I'm not taking classes this semester. Things aren't getting easier and I feel like I'm at the end of my rope. And my grandpa is the one I'd come to to talk about something like this so I feel so fucking alone.", "subreddit": "GriefSupport"}

I sorr of lived in the hospital for a full month while continuining my study and pushed all feelings away (and my mother also did not speak a lot about it). Afterwards I only got a week off from uni so I did not have time to grieve. This resulted in depression, anxiety issues and burnout symptoms.

My boyfriend is my biggest support, and I have to lean on him more than I\u2019d like to admit.\n\nUnfortunately, his mother has had cancer for a long time and she is very ill. She will probably pass away soon, and he is struggling with this - he is additionally susceptible for depression and has the coping habit of pushing everything away/distancing himself.

His last gf committed suicide and I think there is also some unresolved grief there.

He was perfect and could do no wrong. I looked up to that man and he looked up to me. He was my only dad and I was his only daughter. We were the best daddy daughter combo with our matching personality, wit, and unconditional love we had for each other. \n\nWe had lost touch around my teenage years (as in only saw each other once a year) but once I hit my college years, we got even closer. He was full of the perfect advice any college student needed and would never judge me for any of my decisions. \n\nThen came my last semester of grad school, and we got worst news of our lives: my dad was diagnosed esophageal cancer. \n\nFast forward four months, we got through chemo and radiation, surgery, and we\u2019re finally thought to be cancer free. (I say \u201cwe\u201d because anyone who has had someone close go through cancer knows he wasn\u2019t the only one going through it)\n\nWithin the year he was cancer free, I got engaged, passed the majority of my CPA exams, and started my full time career. Things were looking up for all of us. \n\nThen, my dad started having terrible hip pain. I made jokes at him that he was getting old and he would make a smart ass comment back. We spent two months trying to figure out what was causing the pain. They finally took him in for an MRI (as all the other tests came back clean), and that\u2019s when we found out the cancer had spread to his bones. \n\nMy wedding was in three months and I wasn\u2019t 100% sure he was going to make it. But I did know one thing: in three months, he would be feeling worst than now. I made the executive decision to have two weddings: one two weeks after my dad\u2019s diagnosis and the other one at the planned date.\n\nMy dad was eternally grateful for that first wedding. He was still in pain, but was able to walk his only daughter down the aisle. He wrote me a letter telling me I completed his life. But he didn\u2019t know how much that moment completed mine as well.\n\nI lived 5 hours away and made that drive every weekend to spend as much time with my wonderful dad. I gained so many memories, so much quality time, and so much love. But with beauty comes pain. \n\nI saw it all. I saw the doctors struggle to find any combination of pain medicine to control the pain. I heard and felt the times my dad screamed out to God in so much pain. I watched this strong, independent, 6\u20193\u201d 300 pound man become weak, dependent, and in amounts of pain no one would wish on their worst enemy. I saw it.\n\nThen came time for my planned wedding and my dad was in the final stages of death. It broke my heart to tell him that he couldn\u2019t go, as he told me \u201cno I will be there\u201d. But he couldn\u2019t. So I got married a second time without my dad. 8 days after my wedding, I watched my dad struggle as he took his last breath. The first time in the three months that he was pain free. \n\nI feel lost, broken. My best friend in the whole world left. My number one fan isn\u2019t a phone call away. I had so much anticipated grief that I thought it would ease the pain, but it doesn\u2019t. Here I am, four months later, trying to figure out how to live without my handsome man of a father not by my side. Trying to not talk about him constantly because he\u2019s all I think about. Trying to not cry all the time. \n\nIf there\u2019s anything this road has taught me, it\u2019s that life is the most unfair, unjust thing in the world. With extreme beauty comes extreme pain. My heart is full of so much pain because it is also full of so much love.\n\nDad, I love you unconditionally, death included. \n", "subreddit": "GriefSupport"}

She was a woman of grace, class, and dignity, but she was also so humble and compassionate. She was and is the best grandmother in the world. We all expected that her heart would give out, or old age would take her one day and she would have a quick and painless passing. \n\nShe\u2019s 87 years old. She had begun having problems walking. It was diagnosed as neuropathy and not looked into much further. She began having memory problems, some confusion, and trouble finding the right words. In the beginning of November my dad took her to the hospital and they eventually found a very large tumor that was pressing on her brain. That explains it all. They gave no other information except that it was inoperable. She began getting worse and worse, eventually not being able to speak proper words or sentences at all save a very select few. She couldn\u2019t write or speak effectively. By Christmas, she couldn\u2019t remember how to dress herself and her mobility was so limited that she stayed in bed that day. \n\nShe hasn\u2019t been up since. My family has been taking care of her since Christmas Day. Her dying process has been long, painful, and drawn out. At first, she was just really tired and needed help walking to the bathroom; she just needed help with those things and medicine management. Then, she started refusing medicine, food, and water. The last time I went to stay in her room with her, she no longer recognized me. In this past week, she\u2019s been in so much discomfort and pain that it tore me apart to hear her groaning. She couldn\u2019t say anything except, please over and over again; in the same moment she dragged the sheet over her head. She\u2019s ready to go. She wants to be at peace. It was gut wrenching. What makes everything worse is that she could never communicate what was bothering her. She was adamant that she won\u2019t take any medication or be helped, even when she was in a lot of pain/discomfort. It took a lot to let us use an anti-nausea cream on her wrist. \n\nI wish it were easier to say that she can\u2019t make that choice anymore. She\u2019s finally comfortable. Last night they dropped the pain medicine in her mouth anyway because she was in sooo much pain. She hasn\u2019t become conscious since.

We did not have a good relationship for the past 5ish years, he always chose drugs, alcohol, and whatever woman he was with at the time over his children (my brother and I). He was truly an addict. After having children of my own, that was really a path I could not be near, nor my children. Before he passed I never got the chance to try and make our relationship better, and now I'll never get the chance to. At the final passing of the casket before he was cremated I told him something along the lines of; \"I hope you know I didn't hate you, you just chose a lifestyle I couldn't support. I wish things could have been better, and I hope that you are in a better place now, I love you.\" That's the short and sweet version of it. But ultimately how do I know that he got my message? How do I know that he knows I didn't hate him? How do I stop being so angry at him for being an addict, and putting his family through the things that he did? I then think of the good times and that just throws my emotions off even more by becoming sad and really missing him. He truly wasn't a bad man, he just had his battles. Is all of this normal, the anger, confusion, sadness? Any advice is greatly appreciated.\n\nRIP dad, I truly hope you are in a better place with Grandma and Angel (his Rottweiler/lab mix).\nLove Jr.", "subreddit": "GriefSupport"}

Cops found a car on fire, put it out, and then realized there was a body inside. Looks like for some reason she swerved off the road, flipped, and her car caught fire. Her body was so badly burned they\u2019re still trying to identify her, but we know it\u2019s her. She leaves behind 3 beautiful baby boys, ages 1-6. I feel especially awful because although we kept up with each other and chatted through social media, I haven\u2019t actually seen her or had a real chance to hang out with her in a few years.  I almost feel like I don\u2019t have a right to be as sad as I am. I feel selfish, like I\u2019m making this about me.  We were best friends throughout our teens (both now 23), and I love her with all my heart, but you know how life can be. We went from spending weeks at a time at each others houses to living so far apart when my family moved away from our hometown, and the distance made us drift. I never loved or appreciated her friendship any less though. I hope she knew that. I have always, and will always consider her one of my absolute best friends. I just wish so badly I could see her again, and let her know how much I appreciate her.. My heart feels like it\u2019s broken into a million pieces. I almost don\u2019t believe it. Im going to drive the few hours it takes to get to where she lived and meet up with the two other girls we used to hang out with, and we\u2019re going to visit her family this weekend.

The last year of her life was basically spent as a shut-in because the chemo made her too tired to get out of the house very often. She became very dependent on dad to take care of her.\n\n3 months before she passed, she mentioned dad had been seeing and texting girl he knew from high school a lot. She said she felt neglected and it made her uncomfortable. Mom said he made several trips into town to give her rides to work, fixed her car, gave her daughter my sister's old car, fixed her phone, and she was pretty sure he gave her money. Dad even asked me to help find her an apartment in town because she lived so far away.\n\nIt broke my heart to hear that, and felt all too familiar because dad had a history of pulling stunts like this. He left mom for another woman back in 1997 for nearly a year, just months after my sister was born and only came back after his parents intervened. \n\nI talked to my sister about it and we agreed that we would say something to him the next time she was in town. That didn't happen, and mom's health started rapidly declining soon after. I 100% regret never bringing it up to him while mom was still alive.\n\nThe friend continued texting him constantly after mom passed and even showed up to the funeral. She didn't say a word to me or my sister, just hugged dad and mumbled something before leaving. \n\nA few days ago, we found out they were both very active on Facebook, constantly liking and commenting on posts and pictures. Dad even commented on a picture of the friend saying she has \"always been beautiful,\" just 6 weeks ago. It honestly made us wonder how many times he said that to his own wife. He also mentioned the possibility of moving this woman into his house, since she still hadn't found an apartment. For me, that was the last straw.\n\nMy sister and I decided that despite mom being gone, we still needed to say something to both of them. He completely lost it. He started screaming about how wrong we were and that:\n\n-She was the only person he could talk to about what he was going through \n\n-It was my fault they started talking because I refused to talk to him about how mom was dying (he tried bringing it up in front of mom twice, and both times I told him it wasn't the time or place)\n\n-I should have mentioned this to him while mom was alive so he could \"tell her the truth\"\n\n-They have never had any physical contact or even met up in person (this later changed to \"they've only met a few times and it was out in public for maybe 30 minutes total\")\n\n-His friend is a Christian woman who would never meet with him in public because he was married. In fact, she wanted to meet mom, but was afraid to\n\n-His friend was his only real support system this past year, and helped lift his spirits and turn to God when things got tough\n\n-He became friends with this woman after he helped stop her from being raped in high school. She also just got out of an abusive relationship and we need to understand that \n\n-He showed mom all of his texts so she wouldn't worry or feel threatened\n\n-My sister and I should be ashamed for attacking him and his friend over a harmless friendship. After all, we're young and should be more progressive-thinking than that\n\n-The \"beautiful\" comment meant nothing \n\nSince then, he has changed his excuses a few times, given us both the silent treatment (only breaking it to yell at us or give us more reasons that we're wrong about the friendship), changed the locks to mom's house, and begun cleaning up mom's things. \n\nMy sister and I spoke with a woman whose mother died young and whose father exhibited similar behavior. She told us to block them both out, and instead focus on our own grief. It's obvious there was an emotional affair going on, and we shouldn't allow that negativity to ruin our memories of our mother. \n\nI understand his grief, but honestly feel he can't or won't see ours. Just days after mom passed, he told my sister that his grief was bigger than ours because he saw mom every day, while we only saw her every once in a while. It shocked me, and reminded me of how toxic and selfish he is. I know I need to be the strong one here, but I can't help thinking how much easier life would be to cut him out completely. \n\nI'm sorry for the novel, I'm planning to go to grief counseling but until that happens, I needed to get it off my chest.", "subreddit": "GriefSupport"}

He lived around the corner from me and my sister in the most \u201cshady\u201d part of town.  The kind of part of town where you watch all around you when you walk around at any hour. I was too myself, mostly sitting on my stoop in the sun smoking cigarettes, catching a tan but never really talking to those who walked by.  I went to the county fair with my family and ended up staying there while my sister took her kids home catching a ride with a friend . I decided to walk home which was a two mile stretch, but I once it got dark enough I knew it was time to go so I started on my path. I got maybe a half mile up the road and a car pulled over and it was the boy from around the corner. He had a shit eating grin on and he offered me a ride. I politely declined at first continuing to walk and he slowly crept along the side of the road, saying \u201ccmon I\u2019m not going to kid nap you.\u201d I have in eventually and got into the car. I took full inventory of his mental state and he didn\u2019t seem impaired. \u201cHere have some\u201d he said, handing me a wine slushie from the fair grounds and took it, thinking to myself that I would be home soon enough. But after a few moments I realized we had past our street and we\u2019re heading for the highway. \u201cHey, I thought you were taking me home!\u201d I shouted and he locked the doors and said \u201cNo, we\u2019re going to PA(Pennsylvania while I live in NY), don\u2019t worry I\u2019m not going to kill you. I\u2019m Jay. \u201c\n\nAnd I worried he didn\u2019t make good on his first promise but I had always been someone who could take care of myself so I went along with it. We drove about an hour and in that time I noticed lots of things. His sense of humor was sharp, his long blonde hair the color of straw from the summer sun bleaching it, his blue eyes like sweet juicy blue berries, his tattoos. Everything. I was attracted to him I couldn\u2019t lie but I had been wasting my romantic time with a loser at this point whom didn\u2019t even care that I hadn\u2019t made it home or not . But by the time I had made it to the party I decided I could see myself being friends with this interesting stranger. \n\nWe arrived at our destination which was a crazy huge party where everyone was doing everything from smoking weed to dropping acid . I met a lot of cool people and I stuck by his side as we stayed up into the deep of the night, sniffing cocaine, talking about nothing for hours. Eventually we made it back to the car and back to home and he dropped me off saying \u201csee you this time tomorrow \u201c. \n\nAnd that\u2019s how it went, I would see him everyday after work, and we would go and run the streets together. We would spend a lot of time dealing weed and e pills, selling bumps of coke in bar bathrooms. We would laugh, we felt like we were on top of the world together. After time I stopped talking to my romantic interest and Jay and I would use each as wing men picking up people as we pleased but never getting involved . There was a calm understanding that our friendship was worth more than a good time a night or two . \n\nThree years past, in same fashion and we would still be interchangeable parts. He would walk into my house as I would his and pour a cup of coffee in the morning and start unloading about the night before. His mother loved me, always saying we should get together.  And one night I missed up. I said something I shouldn\u2019t have . I repeated something Jay had said to me in short, it resulted in a gun being placed in his mouth . I begged for his life, I gave everything that I could, admitted that I fucked up and I was the one that opened my mouth and I deserved the gun in my mouth. I don\u2019t know if his connect decided that was enough to scare us both but he let us go. And I took Jay home and we crawled into bed and held each other crying until we both fell asleep . \n\n\nFor me, that was enough of the drug world I could handle. I thought we had control but we didn\u2019t. And I knew I wouldn\u2019t be the one to cost anyone their life. I told Jay it was time to make good with all the suppliers and that we would be done. And that\u2019s exactly what we did. We got out from selling and only used. \n\nBut me being me, I got tired of the party. I got tired of taking boys home and never making a life with any of them. So slowly I pulled myself away from Jay, his brother his whole family. And it was painful but I had to do what was needed and I needed to get away from it. I moved, to a different town. And that was the only way I could get away from his gravitational pull. \n\n\nMonths passed and then it was my birthday November 24th and I did what I always did and spent it with my best friend. We got drunk, so drunk. And we remembered everything that had happened between us, all the fights, all the long drives, all the songs that stitched us together into who we were. And we laughed, and kissed. \n\nKissing turning to touching, touching turns to that fire that burns beneath your skin and suddenly we were having sex. Great passionate sex, some of the best sex I ever had because of the attachment. But then we both realized what we were doing in the middle of his mothers kitchen and stopped. We both agreed that it was mistake, but we were both lying to each other and ourselves. \n\nIt scared the fuck out of me. I realized I was in love with him and had been since the day he picked me up from the county fair. He was so much of me and so much of his own self. \n\nThis created the distance that I previously craved so badly, but now at the right time. I knew that I would fall for him if he let me and I think he knew the same. I went a month of blowing him off until I think he got the hint. \n\nHe blew up too saying he knew this was going to happen and that he regretted that it had turned out like this but me being myself a self preserving individual chucked it all to fear all of it . We got into an immense fight and the next day he was in jail . ( with a separate incident).\n\nI wrote him. \nHe wrote me back, being reserved calling me his bestie saying how long it would be until he got out of jail. And this is how it went for a year, and then I went and fell in love with someone that has stable, who was a country boy, who was my knight in shining armor to get out of the \u2018hood\u2019.  \n\nHe wasn\u2019t going to play games, he wasn\u2019t going to go to jail, he didn\u2019t play with gun or girls feelings and he was amazing. And his name was Ken. \n\nA year later when I visited Jay in jail I was pregnant with my first child with Ken. I think it made a pretty clear statement to Jay that I was taken for good. On Halloween of that year I married Ken, in November I received a letter from Jay that thanked me for loving him and saying how happy he was for me for that I found someone who would always take care of me. \nAnd that was that I never thought about my birthday, about the kisses about the sex about any of it. \n\nFast forward to the current future, five years, and I lost Jay. He died from an overdose. From heroin being laced with fethenol, he died on January 5th 2019. And I am shattered I am brought back to all these feelings. I don\u2019t know if I have survivors guilt but I can\u2019t stop reading his last Facebook message asking me to call him that he needed me and missed me AND I NEVER FUCKING CALLED. What kind of garage human being am I? How could I not call him ? I knew he was still on the drugs, had I suddenly became better than taking care of my friends ? \n\nI am constantly replaying all the memories in my head, of our friendship our relationship, our times. I pray he knows that I loved him . I use the phrase pray as a plead to the universe. Seeing him in a casket, touching his cold hand I could of screamed !\n\nHow could you do this ?\nHow could I leave you ? \nHow couldn\u2019t we of worked this out ? \n\n\nI wish that I could hear his laugh, him call me a pet name, see his smile. \n\nI wish people would stop saying he asked for it, he was a junkie, like his life didn\u2019t matter like none of this mattered. \n\nMy pain is deeper but it feels a bit better now that I have let this all out into the universe, I hope that if any one has gone through a similar situation, they could reach out to me....\n", "subreddit": "GriefSupport"}

The laughter in my chest melted away and now I was numb and crying but I couldn't feel my body anymore, I dropped to the cold floor of my highschools hallway. Everyone asked me \"are you ok?\" I couldnt speak.

Understandably so, this has completely devastated my best friend, and has rocked her entire world for nearly an entire year. It's been very hard to watch, and my heart breaks for her loss every day. While she has slowly gotten better with time, she seems to be \"stuck\" in a constant state of negative emotion. To my knowledge, she has not gone to grief counseling or anything of the sort, yet, and I cannot remember an interaction that we have had where the subject did NOT come up. Now, I understand this is a huge devastation for her and her whole world got turned on its side. But I gotta be honest.... as her best friend and someone who takes the brunt of her emotions and venting, Its exhausting and I don't have much more in me. One of her sisters just broke the news to her that she is engaged and while she was happy in the moment, she later vented to me about how its hard for her to be happy for anyone about anything. While I understand that it can feel unfair, it also seems incredibly selfish to be so stuck inside of yourself that you can't recognize the people who love you and have been there for you. I'd never expect her to forget about her fianc\u00e9 or to just \"move on\" but for as hard as it feels like I'm working to help her keep the wheels on the track, it would be great to see her put in an effort to help work through this grief as well. Otherwise, to be honest, I cant carry this load anymore. Our friendship has already been completely one sided for the past 11 months, and thats fine... she gets a free pass for the year.

She had been in and out of the hospital since the end of 2017 up until she passed. On Sunday October 28 I went with my mom and littler sister to go visit her. We were told she was going to be discharged that Tuesday. We were happy and relieved because she was finally told she can go home and be comfortable. Then Tuesday rolls around and they decided to keep her to run some tests on her since all of a sudden they found liquid in her lungs. Then the next day we were told she wasn\u2019t going to make it through the weekend. So at this point it was just a waiting game. Unfortunately she passed that Sunday. Literally a week after I saw her and she looked okay to go home. Then she was just gone. I have been there for my family as much as I can be there for them but no one is really there for me. Mostly because no one will ever understand the pain I\u2019m feeling and what I\u2019m going through. \n\nSee my grandma is Puerto Rican. She was born and raised in Puerto Rico. She only knew and spoke Spanish. Me on the other hand I grew up speaking English never learned Spanish though my mom speaks English and Spanish fluently. So though my grandma was in my life for 23 years, I never was able to have a conversation with her. I was the only one. Rest of my family had that chance and through that created their bonds with her that they can cherish. I never had one with her. I questioned whether or not she thought I loved her or even cared about her. Because I did love and care about her. She was my grandma. My only grandparent present in my life. But I couldn\u2019t ever communicate that with her. \n\nSee the thing is I\u2019ve been feeling like I don\u2019t have a right to grieve or cry or feel anything like the rest of my family does because I never had a bond with her. I have a pretty judgmental family so I\u2019m afraid if I approach one of them and say \u201chey I\u2019m not dealing with this at all.\u201d They\u2019ll just say something along the lines of well you barely knew her like we did so why are you acting like this. Idk, I\u2019m just annoyed and upset and disappointed that I can never tell her how I feel about her and how much she meant to me. Also feeling regretful that due to the language barriers I never created a bond with her and never spent any time with her. I feel so at fault for this. Like I couldn\u2019t taken the initiative to learn Spanish or visit her more or spend time with her more and not let the fact I don\u2019t speak Spanish get in the way but I didn\u2019t and not I can\u2019t take any of that back. I can\u2019t change any of it. It just hurts and I just needed to get this all off my chest. Just need somewhere to release all these thoughts cause idk who or where else to turn to. \n\nTl;dr my grandma passed in Nov \u201818  and I\u2019m having a truly hard time dealing with her passing considering I was never able to have a bond with her due to the language barrier. Now I feel like I don\u2019t have a right to grieve because it\u2019s I believe it\u2019s my fault we didn\u2019t get to have a bond. ", "subreddit": "GriefSupport"}

It was the right thing to do for him and his quality of life, but it absolutely broke my heart.  (We don't have children, so my dogs are very much a source of joy and love in my life.)  Then in March, my SIL's brother committed suicide - it came totally out of the blue, and devastated his family.  We would spend holidays with their whole family, so our families are relatively close.  In April, a friend's wife died unexpectedly.  \n\nIn May, my 94 year old grandfather passed away.  This was an absolute shit-show, with my father failing to let me and brothers know in a timely manner, and I found out via a text message from my aunt while on a trip for work.  She thought  everyone had been notified, and it was safe to send a text message about preliminary arrangements for his memorial service.  His funeral involved a cross-country trip at the last minute, and I spent a good bit of the time with my brothers absolutely raging against my dad and his behavior.  In addition, my family is absolutely behaving badly, fighting over an \"estate\" that is essentially nothing.\n\nThen in July, our other dog, our first dog together, died unexpectedly.  Her heart basically burst and she collapsed in front of me.  We rushed her to the emergency vet, and over a couple of hours found out that her condition was irreparable and had to put her down.\n\nDuring the course of all of this, I was traveling every day for work.  I was willing to do what was asked of me because I was working towards a promotion.  I was stretching myself way too thin, and taking on more than I should just because my boss asked it of me.  Then over the summer, our entire department imploded - 3 people were laid off or fired, my boss was removed from his position managing our team, and the newest person to be hired basically got the job I had been working towards.\n\nIf I could pick one word to describe the past year, it would be LOSS.\n\n* Lost my dogs\n* Lost my grandfather\n* Lost other friends and family\n* Lost opportunities at work\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI've really been struggling, and it's come across at work.  My new boss basically accused me of being insubordinate - she saw my anger, frustration and grief as being aimed at her, like I was intentionally trying to undermine her.  Honestly, she wasn't even on my mind.  I have felt so out of control - any difficult conversation makes me cry.  Crying for me is completely related to stress - it's a physiological response to an immediate stressor.  I'm not crying out of sadness, I'm crying out of frustration and anger.\n\nI reached out to a therapist this week, after my conversation with my boss, because I can't afford to lose my job.  I really like my job and the people I work with.  My husband and I rely on my job for our health benefits.  I have to get this under control, and I have to stop letting the grief undermine my life.  My house is not organized, or as clean as I would normally keep it.  My hobbies have fallen by the wayside. I've gained a bunch of weight, and hate the way I look and how my clothes fit right now.  I'm not feeling successful in my professional life, or at home.  (Fortunately, my husband is very supportive, and we aren't having any marital issues right now.  Which is a relief - I don't know how I would cope if that was a mess too right now.)\n\nI still haven't connected with the therapist yet to make a first appointment, but I need help.  I need help regaining some control over my life.", "subreddit": "GriefSupport"}

I became pregnant but at the time we weren't in a good place financially and he still had not fully gotten a hold of his mental health, so I had an abortion. It was definitely hard but I had no idea how much harder it would become. We broke up and kind of went back and forth knowing we still loved each other. I felt like I needed to push him away at one point though. And he was pretty devastated, I'm not saying he isn't accountable for his actions but it did make him vulnerable and push him into the arms of another girl. She was a trapper keeper, a girl that gets pregnant intentionally and thats exactly what happened. 3 months after we broke up he got her pregnant. He tried to be happy with her but it wasn't going well and we would talk about it. He hoped once the baby was born if things were still not right with the mom he wanted to revisit us, I did too, but we both knew he had to try and work it out with her for the kid. At the same time he had a best friend who hated me from day one, turns out it was one of those best friends who's secretly in love with their best friend, she liked him and thus hated me. She would add fuel to the fire every time we had issues. She was such a horrible person she would constantly make fake profiles and instigate fights between us when we were broken up,  this caused further issues with us - we would think each other was the one creating the fake profiles finally we realized it was someone else. He eventually broke up with the mom of his unborn child and moved to a mountain area with friends. One night a new friend, a dirt bag with multiple DUI's invited him on a ride, the driver was drunk. At some point they swerved off the road into a creek of sorts, the car landing upside down. My understanding from a news article is a pregnant lady saw them and tried getting them out and called the cops. They were airlifted to a hospital where he was put on life support. He was brain dead. That night I had received a text from his friend saying he had to talk to me about Nine, my ex. Hours went by and ofcourse I'm freaking thinking something happened, maybe he was in jail or got hurt. Finally my friend told me the whole story. I never understood what people meant when they said they got the wind knocked out of them hearing bad news, that night I did. It was like all the air escaped me and I just couldn't believe it was real. How could this person who I still loved, who I knew still loved me, this person who meant so much to me, who had such a personality that was unique and amazing. He was everyones friend, knew everyone, very social, very kind, and sweet. How could the world go on without him in it? That whole night I felt like I had to keep remembering to breath. I cried in my car, I was visiting my dad in another state at the time. His friend told me he visited him before they disconnected the machines and let him pass. I was just thinking why couldn't they leave him on longer? Maybe there were some new things the could try, anything. That night I had dream with him in it, he was just there and I told him that I thought he was dead, he just smiled didn't talk and he hugged me. That was that.\n\nThe girl that was so horrible to make fake profiles continued to do so even after he passed. She was a horrible person. It made me so made that this person made the last few months that my ex was alive a battle between us. But I've let that go, I just know if I ever see her again she will know my anger, but I know I will never see her again which is good.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo to this day I am just so confused. I have of course gone on with my life but it's just not..complete. I've dated after him but it feels like everyone falls short so I just end up leaving them, I'm not saying I end relationships just over that but I know it plays a role. I feel like I'm looking for someone like him, mostly because he was what I was always wanted my dream guy. I think about him still almost every day. Sometimes I get down and just think if there is a heaven and he is there I honestly would not mind dying right now, I've lived a fun exciting life, I would be at peace if I died right now knowing he was there. But I also know this is fantasy. And I am not suicidal btw. It's been hard seeing his child grow up through facebook. There's a certain regret, jealousy, sadness I feel by not having our baby, I know hindsight is 20/20 and at the time it was probably the best decision all around but I regret it with all these events. I wish I had a piece of him.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI've talked to a therapist about this among other issues and I know that our relationship was not all rainbows we did have some rough times, we did fight, he was not perfect. I know this. I know that maybe we would have never worked out even if he stayed alive. Even after all this my rational side knows all this and like I said normally day to day I'm actually fine, I mean I think there will always be that underlying longing and sadness, it's like wound that will never really heal and i'll always feel but will and has gotten better.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt's a trip too, I have some of his friends still on social media and I know this is an unfair thought but seeing them happy and just going about their lives sometimes makes me think how? How can they, how can the world just keep going without him in it? But like I said I pull it back and snapback to rationality and I'm fine after. It's only a couple seconds of these thoughts.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe days go on and I would say 80% of the time I am fine, genuinely fine, it's the other 20% that I miss him, i get sad, I cry, I wonder if any man will come into my life that will bring that umpf out of me again. Honestly though it feels great even being able to type this even if no one reads this. None of my friends or family have experienced this same kind of loss, they've lost family members and friends but none have lost people they were in love with, and I feel like it's just different, it's not worse just different. I lost my grandma to cancer a few years before, and me and her were really close I lived with her and she practically raised me but my feelings of loss for her are different. At the same time I know there a lot I haven't dealt with when it comes to grieving her, to some degree I feel like I haven't, I feel bad because I've buried her in my mind and sometimes barely remember her because I feel like it was so traumatic losing her that I filed those feelings away and just decided not to deal with them.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI know I need to go to therapy further but I'm not an outwardly emotional and open person I don't cry in front of anyone unless were really close, I don't like to open up to anyone so I didn't get too much in that aspect from my therapy sessions regarding this stuff.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSometimes I want to post on social media that I'm feeling down about him but I don't want people thinking I'm using  him for attention, really it's just a cry for comfort. Comfort when I'm feeling sad about him. It's that feeling of being an adult who lives alone and wanting your mom or parent to just hold you while you cry, that kind of comfort, or just having someone hug you while cry. When I think of him I wish I had the comfort from someone. ugh that's making me want to cry right now. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt's just hard,  I wish I could just build a time machine and pick him up when I was on my way to visit my dad, he would be alive", "subreddit": "GriefSupport"}

Trying to lick every bit of exposed skin... I can't stop checking for him Everytime I move my office chair. My house is so quiet... I don't hear his claws tapping on the tiles... The collar jingling when he moves, the sighs, the panting... The feeling of his weight on my legs while I sleep, the way he pushed my elbow away to interrupt my gaming and stick his head on my lap... \n\nI dropped food and didn't pick it up immediately because I figured he'd race over and eat it.\n\nHis dog food is just sitting there. His bed is empty, his toys are lying on the floor. His fur still lines the corners of my home and there are still muddy pawprints by the back door....\n\nHe used to sit with me when I cried. He used to follow me to the bathroom, to the couch, to the door. I set up a security camera once... I learned that when I left for work he'd stay by the front door all day until I opened that door 8-9 hours later. \n\nHe was with me every moment. When my ex left me... He was the only thing that kept me happy. Through everything... No matter what happened. He was always there. Now he's not. Now he's gone... I feel so empty.. so numb... My partner in crime. My purest friend...\n\nMy heart aches from the loss. What am I going to do without you. ", "subreddit": "GriefSupport"}

He and my mother divorced when I was fairly young due to his alcoholism. I have a brother who is 16, and my mom did an amazing job raising us and protecting us the best she could. He was never a great dad by any means, but for most of our life, we didn\u2019t know the extent of his addiction. \n\nAbout 5 years ago, we had a huge argument/falling out with my dad and things came to a breaking point. We went from seeing him 2x a week to going several months without hearing from him. It hurt. Somehow my brother and I came to understand how his addiction had progressed. He went to inpatient rehab for about a month but didn\u2019t complete the program. It was apparently not his first time although I never knew as a child. When he came home he seemed okayish. My brother and I were still dealing with the shock of learning how severe an alcoholic he was but we were naively hopeful. \n\nFast forward through several outpatient rehab stays, medical detox, mental health struggles (we suspect he may have been bipolar although he was treated only for depression) as my brother and I try our best to show our dad we love him but are much too hurt by his addiction to keep any semblance of a parent/child relationship. If anything it was the other way around. \n\nChristmas Day, my dad drops by my grandparents\u2019 (his parents) to give us a gift. He can barely stand up, his skin is yellowed, and he can\u2019t express any logical thoughts. We urge him to go to the hospital and he refuses. I insist on following him back to his house as he is in absolutely no condition to be driving. When we get there, I say the most hateful and hurtful words I\u2019ve ever said to my father. \u201cIt\u2019s your fault I\u2019ve had to grow up without a dad. It\u2019s time to grow up and get your shit together, because this is ridiculous\u201d. Those were the last words I\u2019m 100% sure he heard from me. \n\nNew Year\u2019s Eve he goes to the hospital by ambulance and is in terrible shape. My grandparents don\u2019t tell me. He codes New Years morning but is resuscitated, and my grandpa finally calls. When I arrive at the hospital he is on full life support, so swollen that his eyes are forced open, kidney failure, liver failure, bleeding from his esophagus and nose which led to hemorrhagic shock. I can\u2019t get the image of him lying in that bloody bed out of my head. We weren\u2019t sure if he could hear us because he was so heavily sedated. I told him I loved him and kissed his forehead. With no hope for his recovery, my grandparents and I made the decision to remove care and he died immediately. \n\nI feel such immense guilt because I feel like I wasn\u2019t there for him or like I wasn\u2019t the daughter I should have been. Like maybe I could have helped him if I would have stayed more active in his life and encouraged him. I hate that the last words I said to him were so horrible. I\u2019m struggling so horribly with my grief and I don\u2019t know how to handle it. I have to keep working and going to school but I have no motivation to do anything at all. My house is a wreck and I can barely manage to make anything for dinner. My husband has been very supportive and helpful but I feel like there is no possible way he could understand.

My mother passed away in June of 2018, she was 66. I have this plant, just a little common vine houseplant. Thanks to my mom I\u2019ve had it for over 20 years. When I first got it it was someone\u2019s throw away plant that had one little leaf on it. I brought it home and started watering it and caring for it. Before long it was this huge beautiful plant again. Now several things happened over the next few years, I moved a few times and always took my plant with me. In this time my mother had remarried and moved out of state but she kept her house that we grew up in. I had moved back into her house to take care of it and brought my plant with me. \n\nEventually I was offered a job in the same state my mom had moved to and off course accepted it looking forward to being close to her again. I was not in the best position financially at the time which was one of the reasons for taking a job 1,000 miles away from my current location. When moving day came I had about $200 to my name and could only take what I could fit in my car. My little plant stayed behind. \n\nAbout a year goes by and things are going well. My mom calls me to see if I can come by her house that weekend and I am happy to have the chance to see her. When I show up she says she has something for me, she had gone back to her house up north and brought some things back. To include my little vine. She said that when she saw it, it was down to one little leaf and dried up from no one watering it. So she repotted it and brought it back to life. It didn\u2019t seem like much at the time, it was after all just a houseplant . I appreciated the fact that she had done this but again at the time it wasn\u2019t that significant of a thing. It was just a plant.\n\nFast forward to yesterday. My little vine is still in the same pot, with the same soil that my mom had put it in. Only it has mold all through it, I had heard that coffee grounds were good for plants and dumped some in earlier this year, only for them to turn moldy and infect the soil. My little vine was down to one leaf again and I had to get it into a new pot and change the soil, no big deal right. \n\nAs I walked it out to the garage to do this everything hit me. My mom had bought this pot for me. My mom had planted this vine in this soil with her hands. My mom nurtured this plant back to life bc she wanted me to have it back. At the thought of dumping this moldy soil out I was overwhelmed by the thought of my mom putting it in this pot with me in mind and started to cry uncontrollably. I miss her so much.

It was a Friday, and his name was Raymond. He spent the day drinking and doing drugs until later in the afternoon when he decided to steal a truck so he could see his girlfriend in the next town. He found a truck at a cardlock fuel station, running, with the keys still inside. The man who owned the truck saw him getting in and driving away. He jumped in with his buddy who was also fuelling his truck and they chased Raymond down a highway. They called police who tried to intercept the truck before it left town, but they were not successful. Raymond then led police on a high speed chase. He had just gotten out of jail that day. That fucking day. My sister was taking her daughters shopping. They were excited to spend their allowance money. They were listening to music and cruising along, not knowing what was coming. At 5:20pm they were hit head on, the truck running right over top of them, killing three instantly, and gruesomely. The little one, who was just six, survived for one more day. She was little, so she was spared somewhat, but she died the next day, surrounded by family. I was inconsolable and unresponsive. I stayed in a fog for an entire year, and then I moved away. I have PTSD from a combination of the relentless coverage, the autopsy reports,  and disgusting pictures the media took of the accident scene. I am not who I was. I am more afraid in ways I should not be, more brave in ways that may hurt me. I cannot grieve. I cannot cry. I am stuck in an endless loop of trauma. I do not know how to leave the room.

He wasn\u2019t known to date in fact he hadn\u2019t dated since second year high school. Last March he finally asked me on a date and I couldn\u2019t believe it. I had been in numerous toxic relationships and never thought someone as good as him would be into me. I honestly dismissed my crush with him and shortly after he asked me out. We dated  for about 8 months. He showed me a healthy loving relationship. Something I\u2019d never known before. I broke up with him the end of October because in his free spiritedness was also a short coming in responsibility. It was something fundamental that I felt if we took time apart to grow (while I worked through the stress of university) he would get his stuff sorted and so would I. We remained friends and it was so amazing. I loved being around him. Literally everything we did for each other was out of the interest of love. I wanted to build our friendship deeper so we could have a more successful romance. We were on our way. When we dated we indirectly talked about marriage and kids. I love him so much. I never stopped thinking about him. He crossed over from an accident on January 14th and everyday is so hard. I can\u2019t stop crying. I dropped out of school and moved out of my apartment to live with my family. I thought I was going to get back together with him but I made it clear to him that I can\u2019t tell the future and I didn\u2019t know what was going to happen.  I was really enjoying our friendship and I\u2019m just grateful that we were on good terms when he passed.

He was 19 and died in a car accident a few weeks ago while we were on winter break. When students were accepted, there was a Groupchat made in which like 20 of us talked constantly (as in, we sent upwards of 700 messages a day.) This student was one of the many kids I talked to before I got on campus and followed on social media, but we did not interact much when we actually got to school this fall. We have many mutual friends (I am very close with someone who lives on the same floor as him and who was very close to him) and while I would not say he is someone that I was particularly \"close\" to, his death is really, REALLY hurting me. When I found out, I sobbed for hours. It's been several weeks and still, I find myself crying sometimes. It's just so unfair. I really can't wrap my head around it and even worse, I feel guilty for even feeling so upset about this. What I am feeling is NOTHING that his friends and loved ones are feeling and it seems wrong of me to even feel so hard. I don't think I have been very public in my grief (other than to my friends who I have cried in front of about it on occasion), but still, even feeling this makes me feel dumb and like an attention whore somehow.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI go to a small college (as in 500-students-per-graduating-class small) and as such, everyone knows everyone and the \"community\" aspect of the school is very, very big on campus. When we got back to school last week and it seemed like people were in two camps: either you knew him and you were absolutely \u2014and rightfully so\u2014 OR you didn't really know him \u2014at this college, it is very rare for a name to just be completely unheard of\u2014 and had a kind of \"Oh yeah, that's so tragic. Life is so short.\" reaction. I'm so tired of feeling somewhere in the middle. I know it would not be appropriate at ALL for me to approach those who knew him with my grief, but I find myself feeling so underwhelmed when I speak to people who find it \"sad\" but are otherwise, seemingly unaffected. I know that everyone grieves differently, but I can't find anyone else who seems to feel how I'm feeling about this. I'm really, really hurting.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI suppose I'm sad because he died only after his first semester and there is so much more that he could have done while here and for the rest of his life. Who knows who he would have become friends with, who he would have dated, what he would have majored in? He's never going to get to buy his first apartment or get married or have another favorite song or be the best man at one of his college friend's weddings. And worst of all, I'm sad/worried that he is going to become a footnote. Because it happened so early, the rest of our friendships will get to develop and become lifelong and he will forever be 19. It makes me so upset that his life could become something where we meet up at our five-year-reunion and say \"Oh, yeah. Remember him? Rest in peace\" and never touch it again. It's so fucking unfair that he isn't going to get to build those relationships and become somebody like the rest of our class and that anger and sadness makes me almost nauseous.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI don't know what to do.

I get angry at anyone around because I just want to be alone. Writing is how I get through this. I need to share to get it out of my head and heart. \n\nI will soon be at my Mom\u2019s funeral. Sitting in my childhood room, in my Mom\u2019s bed, in a house that will never be the same again. Cuddling a stuffed animal for the first time since I can remember. Sore and blurry eyed from staring at my MacBook for hours. With noise canceling headphones and a locked door, I feel enough solitude to let go. I am in a cycle of insomnia and napping. I am so tired I cannot feel. I am so hungry I cannot feel. I am wasting away. I am not sure if this is on purpose. Self-protection works in mysterious ways. Depression is an easy friend, like a weighted blanket. I need my Mom to take care of me, to tell me everything is going to be okay. Knowing I cannot have that, ever again, is paralyzing. \n\nThis will be my second funeral. 15 years ago, I lost my father. I was unprepared and unprotected and only 13. I felt so old at the time. I fear he died alone and angry. I am mad at him and I hate him for abusing my Mom and for dying and I miss him. I miss him like I am missing a part of an organ. My body functioning but compromised. Pretending I don\u2019t need him. Wishing I didn\u2019t need him. \n\nThrough all of that, for better or worse, there was Mom. There was always Mom. She had to be our everything. Life knocked her down many times, but her love for her three children never wavered. She used all of her strength to make sure we knew we were loved, worthy, capable and free. That was her gift.\n\nThe day she told me she was sick everything slowed down. I was standing and almost fell over. I had to go outside. I paced and shook thinking, \u201cNo, no, not again. I can\u2019t do this again. No! This. will. break. me. . . and my Mom won\u2019t be there to put me back together\u201d. I was yelling at the universe, pleading. When I came back inside I didn\u2019t notice her fear, her devastation, her denial. She was only 55 and healthy. How was this possible. How could she have malignant cancer. We both needed someone to hug us and tell us everything was going to be okay. Instead we just stood and stared at each other. Not wanting this to be real. Not knowing how little time we had left. Not knowing she would die 5 months later. Not knowing she would lose the ability to walk, eat, talk, recognize who I was. And the pain. Fuck cancer. My poor Mom was not ready to go, not ready to lose her autonomy. She washed my sister\u2019s hands in the bathtub as my sister bathed her and was always asking if we had enough to eat as we fed her. Not wanting to let go of being Mom. \n\nWe thought we had time.  \n\nGrief: saddening, maddening, weird. No one knows how to feel. It\u2019s awkward to help; it\u2019s awkward not to help. I am not ready for another chorus of \u201cI am sorry for your loss\u201d. All I want to do is scream in the face of social platitudes. Most people try to do the right thing. Follow social expectations. But emotions don\u2019t follow rules. I don\u2019t know how long it will take before I can think about my future without crying. I am grieving things that have not happened yet. I came to terms with not having my Dad here. Having to accept my Mom won\u2019t be there either leaves me breathless. When will this start to feel normal? I thought my Mom would be there when I got married and/or had children. Knowing she won\u2019t be is a depth of sadness I cannot contain. It creeps out of every part of me. And I know a sad shadow will be with me in every big moment in my future. The weight of missing my Mom. A weight so powerful I protect myself with anger and walls. \n\nI did not know I was holding onto the loss of my father until faced with the death of my mother. It cracked the hole of loss wide open, pulling everything into it. It has to be filled. Letting go of both of my parents feels like I am letting go of part of my soul. My entire foundation is liquid and I will be a new person after this. I hope I have the courage to trust, to lean on my friends and let people in. If anything, being next to death really makes you feel alive. I want to let life in. Please let this sadness show me how beautiful and precious life is. Please let time remove my walls. Please let me heal. \n", "subreddit": "GriefSupport"}

Let me just preface this by saying this is a long story. So buckle your seat belts, or just go on to the next post. I don't really care, I just need to write this.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI met my now ex, now dead, husband in the fall of 2015. We separated last March and were officially divorce in October We met on a dating site and we just really clicked, right off the bat. He was so so smart, funny, handsome, and so kind. I was also attracted to the fact that he was foreign, but this also came with some issues. He overstayed his travel visa, so he could not go back home without the US banning him for coming back for the next 5 years. He didn't put any pressure on me to marry him or anything, we just kind of lived with this for a while. Eventually, it became too much of an inconvenience and I knew whole heatedly that I loved him. We were married after 9 months of being together.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe first couple of years of our marriage were amazing. Everything was just going our way. My husband worked with bitcoin so we were holding a lot when it spiked in 2017. We thought we were millionaires, and could do whatever we wanted. This led to partying a lot and using a lot of drugs, as I'm sure you can see by looking at my past history. We were experimenting with all sorts of hallucinogens, empathogens, dissociatives, amphetamines. There were some drugs we drew a hard line on, and promised never to do, those were opiates and meth. I'm not going to lie, I fell pretty hard into the drugs. I was not really addicted to one particular substance, but I was doing something different everyday. Meanwhile, my husband was doing the same, but he became particularly fascinated with dissociatives. For those who don't know what those are, some common ones are ketamine and pcp. My husband started displaying some worrying symptoms. I'd come home from work and find his heart racing and him sweating barely conscious. He developed some type of psychosis as well. He would wake me in the middle of the night and insist people were spying or that there were cameras in our house. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI tried so hard, I even let him continue using the drugs to ween himself off, but of course he'd lie to me about the dose. All of a sudden, someone that had always had been so honest with me was coming up with all sorts of lies. He was also very good at concealing his use. He was very smart, so he'd make vape juices infused with drugs or nasal sprays. Eventually it did get to a point where he was just so fucked up he couldn't even hide it anymore. I felt hopeless, we'd been to therapy, psychiatrists. He was never really invested in it though. He insisted that he needed to have ketamine infusion therapy for his depression, like wtf! Everyday he'd tell me how miserable I was making him by being so controlling. After, a brief period of sobriety, I came home to find him out of his mind, fucked up. That was it, I was done. I told him he had to leave the next day. He had a lot of rage smashed all my glass rigs and bongs because of my \"cannabis addiction\" lolz. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFast forward a couple of months. He's met some girl who is now the love of his life, this girl was practically homeless, no car, no job, but he took her in. He took her in because she was the only girl who was going to be ok with his drug use because she could take advantage of his money. They both started using lots of drugs together. She became crazy like him, she'd call me in the middle of the night to tell me she had found the cameras I planted. They were both pretty nasty to me for a long time. Eventually it got to a point that I needed to block them on every social media, every messaging app, emails and phone numbers. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI hadn't heard from either of them in months, but 10 days ago I got a call from his best friend telling me that he had died. I was way more shocked and heartbroken than I thought I would be. What made it even worse, is that he has no family other than his sister living in a different country. So my mother and I had to act as power of attorney and take care of everything because his girlfriend is 22, basically a fucking child and is capable of nothing. I had to go into that horrible house to collect his belongings. There was dog shit everywhere, so much trash you could not walk or see any counters, there were straws and lines still laid out. There was blood on the floor from when he had stabbed himself a couple weeks earlier and of course, I saw exactly where he died. It was pretty traumatic for me, I'll never forget that house. It is still unclear what drugs he overdosed on. He was shooting up ketamine pretty heavily, and I believe he may have mixed a little of his pain killers from the hospital with it. We still don't know yet though, just my suspicion.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI probably should have posted this on r/drugs but the reason it is here because I am grieving, and I am grieving hard. It's like all those bad things he ever did are just gone and now I only remember the good stuff and that makes me sad and gives me the feeling that I still love him. I just don't know what to do, I think my friends and family think it's a little weird that I'm upset about a person that was so terrible to me. There were a few really amazing years though, he was my best friend, we knew everything about each other. There is still no one who knows me as well as he did. So I find myself grieving the person he was and not the person he became. I know my boyfriend probably feels uncomfortable too. I just have so many conflicting emotions that are driving me insane. I felt like maybe writing this all out might help. So anyway, there's my story. Thank you for making it to the end.", "subreddit": "GriefSupport"}

My grandmother died a year ago, my grandfather died 4.5 years ago. My grandmother and I stopped seeing eye to eye on things a few years ago so we weren't as close when she passed, and I was states away while she was in the hospital for the last time. The last time I saw her she was in her kitchen, grinning and handing me SO many cookies. Because of that, I feel like I got closure with her and though I miss her, the loss doesn't itch as badly.\n\nBut my grandpa (Papa, as I'll call him in the rest of this post) passed while I was still in high school, and he used to drive me to the bus stop every morning- even though it was a three minute walk- just to get that time with me. We were best friends, in every sense of the word. He would make Spongebob jokes at me when the rest of the adults were talking about things I didn't understand. He'd talk to me about drama with kids at school. He let me eat Girl Scout Cookies after breakfast.\n\n  \nBecause I was still living with my parents in the area when he was sick, I was with him basically when I wasn't at school or at an extra curricular. I thought he had many years left with the \"cancer management\" they were doing so I wasn't worried when he went into the hospital just for observation. Then they moved us to a bigger room, since we \"had so much family visiting.\" Then they brought the snack cart. Then out of town relatives started coming, and I realized what was happening only a few days before he passed. Everyone had hidden it from me so I wouldn't worry, but he was really in hospice care.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe last time he was awake, my grandma tried to pass his hand off to me from hers, and he jolted away. \"It's \\*insert my name\\*,\" she said. \"Don't you want to say hi?\" He grunted with stress, and I immediately welled up. He didn't recognize me and my distraught grandma kept making him more upset by trying to force him to interact. I was devastated, even though my mom told me he just wasn't really coherent.   \n\n\nThe next day, he was completely comatose and we thought he was going to pass on so the family (about 12 of us) were all going up and whispering in his ear. I hate being watched, and I didn't really think he could hear me, so I said \"no\" when my mom asked if I wanted to say anything, and she said that was okay and went and spoke to him for me. I've always regretted that, even though years later my mom told me she didn't think he could hear us, but even if he could, she told him that I was there, and that I loved him so much and he was allowed to go. We could be okay without him. He ended up holding on for a few more days, and waiting to pass until we all went home one night to get some well deserved rest because he had seemed stable that day. He was extremely private, so I truly believe that was on purpose.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis time of year is so hard, because after he died I threw myself into schoolwork and activities. Then a few months later, around the end of January, school started to calm down and I let myself grieve for him for the first time. I regret so much not telling him it was okay for him to go, that I loved him and it was going to be okay. We didn't say \"I love you\" much as it was. I am devastated that the last time I looked into his crystal blue eyes they were filled with frustration, anguish, and confusion instead of laughter and love. I feel guilty, because I am still grieving so much for him when moving on from my grandma's loss was so much easier. I don't know if I'm really looking for advice. I'm in therapy and we talked it over today and I am trying to keep his spirit alive through me, and do things that will honor him.

He was sitting passenger side with another cousin driving to his car when he pulled the trigger and shot himself in the head. He bled out in a taco bell parking lot. \n\nThe night/morning that he died I had received several missed calls from my aunt and actually said to my husband  that someone better have died because the amount of times she called me was ridiculous.\n\nWhen I woke up I read a text from my uncle saying that I needed to call him because my cousin had an accident.\n\nI thought, \"fuck he got into a car accident driving impaired again.\"  Then I called and he told me my cousin was dead.\n\nI didn't know how to react, I was in shock. So I drove to my moms house and as soon as I woke her up the words spilled out of my mouth and I fell to the floor. I couldn't breathe, speak, think straight. I sat on the floor and wrapped my arms around myself as tight as I could. After that I drove to my uncles house where everyone was crying but it was so quiet. \n\nI went to the store and numbed myself with alcohol until his wake. \n\nI lost it at his wake. I had only seen two dead bodies before him, my grandmother and uncle but I was really young so it didn't register. This was different. I grew up with my cousin. We talked everyday. Went to lunch every couple of weeks. We were the outcasts of the family. He was so out there with his beliefs but that was how I loved him. He always looked like a Rockstar and always had something outlandish to say. With him I didn't have to pretend to be someone else. There was no censoring what we said. He was the most authentic person I knew. \n\nHe always had this sadness about himself. I understood his depression. I encouraged him to get help and he did but the counseling and meds didn't work for him. So he tried every drug you could think of to put him out of his misery. \n\nWhen he got his gun I knew that it was a bad idea. I tried to emphasize the importance of gun safety. I tried to teach him what I know. I tried to give him a holster that locked around his gun because he didn't have a safety on it.\n\nWhen he talked about his depression it'd always come in the form of \"You know I'm not going to get old, I'm going to die young,\"\n\nI'd always talk to him about saying that, I'd stress how important his existence was. How much I'd miss him, how many people loved him. It seemed that he was set on dying young. He said it so much like he was trying to normalize the thought. Like he was trying to get me prepared.\n\nHow do you prepare for the death of someone so close to you? Someone that has been there your whole life? \n\nThere's a void in my heart. There isn't a day that goes by that he isn't in my thoughts. I wish I could talk to him. \n\nHe was my truest friend. I know he's gone but sometimes I'll see someone who looks like him or i'll see the same car he had and forget that he isn't the one driving it. \n\nEveryone keeps saying that the pain will dull with time.  Everyday without him it seems as if the wound is fresh. \n\nI don't think my soul will ever stop hurting for him. \n\nI miss my cousin.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;", "subreddit": "GriefSupport"}

He got so sick he couldnt work anymore and lived off his disability until about a year ago when his sickness got worse and he had to go and be in assisted living facility. The thing is, we all saw this coming, and I've dealt with grief before (my father died in an accident when I was 12 and my brother took his own life a month later) but it feels different. When my dad died I was horribly sad but he had never been a big part of my life, so I only really think of him when I see a picture or smell his cologne, the same with my brother, his death completely destroyed our family, but he was only 22, he had barely begun to live his life so my memories of him are hazy.

My father and brother died before cellphones and facebook were a thing so I dont have messages from them saved, or a facebook to look at. I do with Bill. He was so so gentle and loving.

We quickly fell in love and started planning our future life.  \n\n\nIn September of 2001 I was unemployed, finding it a bit difficult coping with keeping a job because of some inability to cope emotionally. 9/11 happened, which of course affected the national psyche the way anyone alive at the time can attest to. During this time my now fiancee continued to work 40 hours a week for fairly low pay. Because of this we struggled fairly hard heading into October.  \n\n\nOn October 7th we went to a concert venue in Salt Lake City to try to meet the bands Disturbed, Drowning Pool, and Systematic (One of our shared loves was cheesy nu-metal). We didn't have tickets, we just wanted the chance to meet some cool people before the show. The bassist from one of the bands ended up coming out, and asked if there was a place to buy an electric razor around. Since there wasn't my fiancee offered to drive him downtown and back to pick one up, which we did. Her kindness saw us rewarded with 2 tickets and backstage passes to the show. It was a wonderful night where we had a lot of fun, grateful for the free entertainment when life was difficult.  \n\n\nShe was a type 1 juvenile diabetic, and a few days before she had decided to ration her insulin for 3 days. On October 8th she called me from work saying that she wasn't well, so I rushed over, picking her up and taking her to the hospital. As soon as she got there they took her blood, and I sat in the waiting room with her. I told her that nothing can happen to her because we have to grow old together, and she said things would be fine. Staying overnight was a precaution. So at midnight when the ER staff told me to go home, I did.  \n\n\nOctober 10th was supposed to be her bridal shower, so a number of her family was already in town. The night before I called her wonderful, supportive mother to say that she was at the hospital. I gave her the details, and went to bed expecting to wake up going back to the hospital to meet my bride who had a health hiccup.  \n\n\nInstead I got a knock at my door. It was her two aunts in town for the shower, who I had expected to pick me up. We get in the car, and I start asking about how my fiancee is doing, and they both break down into tears. Before they can say it out loud I just said \"no...\".   \n\n\nEarly in the morning of the 9th she woke up feeling well. Walked around. Got a drink of water. Then went into cardiac arrest due to ketoacidosis. The doctors tried to revive her for 45 minutes while I slept in the early morning.  \n\n\nShe was the only person who ever saw me as the kind of person worthy of loving and kindness. I went through a years-long grieving process, and ultimately thought that I had found some type of peace with this cruelty. But it has been exceedingly hard to form relationships. I spent 2 years with another woman who did not have a fraction of the capacity for love that my fiancee did, so when we ultimately split I gave up on the idea of a happy future with another person.  \n\n\nI started going to therapy recently. I have a lot of anger to deal with, much of which I thought was rooted in the poor upbringing I had. But as we're getting further in it's coming to light that I haven't processed this at all. I've told a few people over the years about what happened, but only in an abstract sense. My therapist was the first person in at least 10 years to ask me what her name was, and it was surprisingly difficult to answer. As I go through my box of mementos and memorabilia I realize this is the most heavy thing in my life. Not any other traumas I may have gone through.  \n\n\nI have spent 10 years alone because I am punishing myself. She was the most important part of my life, and through my laziness we didn't have enough money. Because we didn't have enough money she rationed insulin. Because she rationed insulin she died. She was the most important person in my life, the only one who made me think I had goodness in me. Not only do I feel like an unlovable person, I feel like that even if I was worthy of another chance I'm not to be trusted because of what happened. People tell me all the time that it's not my fault that she was born with a life-stealing disease, and I get that. But even if working a shit job kept her alive 30 more seconds it would have been worth it.  \n\n\nIt's amazing to me how much I am being affected by this 17 years later.

I keep thinking of how my friends from college are going to drive all the way here to be with me.. and how I\u2019m probably gonna cry when i see them. Then i think \u201cno i need to be strong during the wake and funeral\u201d i just hope I\u2019m not setting myself up for a breakdown by suppressing all this. I do cry... i just hide It when around my family. ", "subreddit": "GriefSupport"}

I'm 26 and just lost my mom (55). \n\nMy mom and I weren't close growing up but over the last 10 years we've really rebuilt our relationship.  Just a little backstory..my mom had bipolar (which went untreated when I was younger) and she struggled with alcohol. She was absent parent but when I was around 16 she really turned her life together. She started going to meetings, taking her medication regularly and really working her program. My dad and her divorced ten plus years ago. They were toxic for one another so it really was for the best. \n\nSince July of 2018, my mother has not been the same. She lost her toe due to diabetes complications, she's had back issues, ect. Over the summer, she had a heart attack, had a breathing tube and we prepared ourselves. She got semi better and we found her a rehab, turned out to be a shit show. She wasn't eating and dropped over 100 pounds. Around November she was hospitalized again, found a different rehab and we thought she was doing better. Shortly after Christmas, she was back in the hospital again. Fast forward to this week, she was supposed to have a MRI done of her stomach but when they brought her in her blood pressure was 70/55. They were giving her blood pressure medicine to stabilize her and soon after they put her on a breathing tube. \n\nLast night my fiance and I went to sit with her, talk to her in hopes she'd wake up as they had stopped the sedative. I woke up this morning to a call from my family. They had resusitated her but her time was limited. I went to the hospital and we spoke to the doctors and her quality of life was dwindling. I said my words to her and this afternoon, they removed her breathing tube and she passed this afternoon around her family. \n\nI am at a loss. Despite her flaws, I loved her and I miss her more than words can say. I wish I had more time. I just have this feeling of loss that is the worst feeling in the world. \n\nI wish I spent more time with her. I don't know how to do this. I just want my mom back in the worst way. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;", "subreddit": "GriefSupport"}

I've always been an admirer of how intellectual and emotionally-intelligent the reddit community appears to be (most of the time) -  observing as an outsider but now I join with my first post.   \n\n\nI guess I want words of comfort, validation, wisdom, empathy or whatever the f\\*ck. I guess I also want to feel less alone in my soul-crushing anguish.   \n\n\nA little bit of background info, I'm a 25 year old woman. I suddenly lost my dad in July 2017. I'm too young to deal with this pain, life is so cruel and unkind. I've experienced a lot of trauma in my life already, even before my loss. I just can't deal sometimes... this is what I wrote in my notes on my phone just now:  \n\n\nCW: grief, suicidal ideation   \n\n\n\"I'm done. I'm so done. I've been done for a long time. I can't take it any more. I know it's selfish but I need the relief. I need to be free. I can't bare living life like this, these moments when they hit me, they can range from feeling absolutely debilitated and breaking down in tears to this gnawing empty, dead feeling inside, both making me feel so disconnected, detached, hopeless. I think the latter, the empty, dead feeling is the worst sometimes. \n\nI wish I could escape my pain but I can't. I can't escape the fact that my dad is dead, is gone forever and I am never going to see him ever again. I am carrying so much emotional turmoil and trauma inside. Most have no idea. Most seem to not be around or want to engage, I don't trust people. I've conditioned myself to not want or need anyone, I've learnt to self soothe based on years of being invalidated, discredited, treated like I'm inferior, insignificant, like I and my feelings don't matter. Shown how selfish and cruel and untrustworthy people can be. Mostly selfish, mostly uncaring. \n\nI can't take this anymore. It's been a little over a year and a half, while I've made some miraculous steps forward in my life, in my personal development, that pain, the grief festers, it feels so raw. It's still so recent. \n\nHow can I try to keep moving forward when I feel so detached and disconnected like this? The brutality of what I need to face, again and again is excrutiatingly, intensely overwhelming to say the least. \n\nHe's gone. That's it. Life goes on, clearly. But I can't, I feel so stuck sometimes. Like I need to process what happened 27367262 times to even feel like I'm moving an ounce in a soul-healing direction. It's traumatizing as fuck. To see your parents dead body, to witness the heart wrenching and infuriating aftermath, to relive those moments, it haunts you, it rattles you to the core. Flashbacks when you least expect it. When you're present, enjoying lifes simple joys only to have such intrusive images take a hold over you when you least expect it, to learn to control your reactions so as not to reveal to others what is unfolding inside, the images that flood your consciousness, how much your heart stings\".   \n\n\nI will be expressing more in the near future but I feel compelled to share this for now. It beats making myself vulnerable again by posting on facebook (which I did at the start of my grief as I felt like its what I needed at the time) as it leads to further alienation and people making assumptions and shit so fuck that and fuck them.   \n\n\n&amp;#x200B;", "subreddit": "GriefSupport"}

I've been trying to sleep for about an hour and have gone back and forth between crying and just feeling anxious. I decided to try to distract myself with the internet, but then I couldn't find anything distracting. So I looked up grief support. I hope you don't mind if I share some things.\n\nMy mom died on March 6, 2018. It was rather sudden. She'd been in and out of the hospital since November 2017, but in the past she'd been in the hospital a lot. She always got better and came home. My mom was kind of a generally unwell person. When I was in high school, a surgeon messed up a foot surgery, so she was on disability and on pain meds the rest of her life. She was also an alcoholic. My mom died because of cirrhosis. She needed a new liver. But the doctors discovered tumors metastasized to her rib cage and hip bones. There's no way she could get a new liver if she had cancer, and she couldn't survive any cancer treatment with such a poor liver. We found this out on February 21, 2018. She was moved to hospice a few days later. I spent as much time with her as I could. She soon lost consciousness, sometimes mumbling, sometimes squeezing my hand, sometimes fidgeting. I tucked her in and read her things and talked to her. It's the most difficult thing I've ever done. It still haunts me. I wasn't there when when she died. We couldn't afford a funeral. My uncle borrowed from his 401k to get a basic burial. My aunt gave us a plot. My mom still doesn't have a headstone.\n\nI didn't have a good relationship with her. I had just moved out in September 2017. I had hoped our relationship would get better with some distance, with us not crushing each other. She never got to see my apartment.\n\nA few months after she died, my apartment burned down. Then a month after that, our family dog died. Then I lost my job.\n\nI'm struggling in a lot of ways, but I'm mostly feeling unsafe and scared of losing things. I'm in a relationship now, since October. My first relationship, actually, that I've ever had. And all I can think is that it's going to end. I'm going to lose it. I'm constantly terrified. I currently have a temporary job. I'm hoping they'll keep me on permanently, but in the back of my mind, I just know that that won't happen. Just like I know my relationship will fall apart. Everything will end horribly. I had to move twice after the fire because the place they put me the first time was awful. So even though I have an apartment now, I'm terrified. It doesn't feel like my home.\n\nYeah, there's a lot going on here. Yeah, I have a therapist. But it's just so much all the time and it's like it attacks me when I'm trying to sleep. And I know it's connected to my mom's death. I miss her a lot and I feel guilty for a lot of things. I want to talk to her. I want her to talk to me. I want her to meet the person I'm seeing. I'm trying to cope and be strong and keep moving forward. But then I just don't know what I'm doing. What's the point? My therapist wanted me to put together a vision board so I could visualize what I want in my life in the next six months to the next year. Nothing too long term. I have no idea what I want. I'm scared to want things. I finally made the board, but I feel it's very basic stuff. I need a new car. I want to make my apartment feel more homey. I want to work more towards actively practicing yoga and mediation.\n\nI get very upset somewhat easily, and it mostly has to do with fear of losing everything. It's obvious why I feel this way, but I don't know how to deal with it. How do I stop getting completely overwhelmed by my emotions? How do I remember my mom without it being sad?\n\nThanks for reading. I appreciate any thoughts.", "subreddit": "GriefSupport"}

But eventually it happened, my mother suffered from a rare autoimmune disease and it was slowly progressing over the years. During september 2017 she started to suffer from severe pain on her belly and heart and lung-related problems. I was there the whole time for her, we were both there fighting against that damn disease like we did many time before.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI was doing everything for her, primarily because my dad refused to help her (he suffers from anxiety and got old pretty quickly, so I don't blame him that much), and because she couldn't move properly after she developed a neuropathy in 2014. I honestly thought that she was gonna make this time, just like many others. She was there during Christmas and new years eve, sure she was suffering a lot, but things kept on going. Then January 6th came, she insisted on giving me a day off, and I accepted it, I decided to enjoy the evening with my friends. Luckily for her, my bro was there to help her out, so I wasn't too worried about her. But eventually he texted me telling me that she wasn't feeling so well and decide to get her to a hospital, we tried doing that the week before, but the staff and the doc there told us that at that moment without her medical exams there wasn't much they could do, so they dismissed her. This time they let her in, and during the first week, things were....okay. She seemed better and her heart was doing okay, but back in my head something was telling me....something was saying that the worse was about to come, and it did, after they dispatched her from ICU she remained on a standard room with another woman that was recovering from a head surgery. Immediately after I arrived there the atmosphere was...intense, sure I was happy to see my mom out of the ICU , but something about her...wasn't right, she was too tired to do anything and her breathing kept getting worse. Eventually, my bro arrived to help her out a little bit, and he decided to stay with her over the night.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThen it came, in the next day my brother texted me saying that the lady that did the head surgery had to go back to ICU, and that my mom wasn't feeling so good, an hour passes and he calls me, basically the nurses checked on my mom and they noticed that she was clearly getting worse by the the minute, so they decided to transfer her back to the ICU, then on the elevator she ended up having a SCA (Sudden cardiac arrest) . My brother told me everything and I called my dad and I drove there as fast as I could. In the hospital, we waited...and waited, god those were tense moments, eventually the doc came telling us that she was stable, but her chances of coming out of this alive were very slim. I could not accept that, my sweet little mom was about to die, I felt horrible, felt like I failed her in some way....but I kept on going, for her. Eventually, they got her out the tubes and we came to visit her every day for 5 days straight, I still remember the last hug she gave me and the talk we had on my b-day , January 18th, she even let me feed her, it was...nice.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThen the day came, januray 19th , we were there waiting outside the ICU to visit her. The doc came up to us and warned us about her situation, basically, they actually thought for a day or two that she was gonna make it, but turns out that she was slowly getting worse, so they tried to prepare us for the inevitable. I was really fucking stupid and tried to tell them that she is strong and that she is gonna make it. They gave me an authorization to remain with her on the ICU, and one hour after the visit I remained there..eventually, her lungs were in need of more air, they asked me to wait outside cuz they were gonna intubate her again. I called my family asking them to come back, it was pretty obvious what was about to happen. A couple of hours later, she passed away, right in front of me, with me and my bro at her side....I am still unsure if she was aware of what was happening, it looked like she was trying to say something and she even looked at me at some point...so I think she knew, she always knew...she always talked about death and how she didn't have much time left, and I always took her for granted.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThat year, 2018 was probably the worst year of my life, a couple of months after that another relative of mine passed away in a shoot out, and eventually, my dad kicked my out of home, the guy that I was taking care of...He is very old and needed help with food and medicine and after he got a gf he simple kicked me out. It took me a long time, but eventually, he apologized for everything and even helped me out with my new place. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow, an year later me and my bro decided to throw her ashes on a nice place, it was the place my brother decided to do some hiking with his friend on the day before she got to the hospital, she told us that if the place was pretty she would love to have her ashes to be thrown on top of that mountain, and we did just that, and you know what? I feel better now, much better actually, I live on my own, I am ....maybe not happy, but I think I am getting over my depression, I have my dog, my brother is like my best friend and we are having some plans in order to create some small business in the future, and  I am studying for my masters now....so yeah, things are better, I wish my relationship with my dad was a bit better, he doesn't treat me in the nicest way, and I still don't  know why , but now that I am here by myself I don't feel that bothered about him, so that 's okay. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnyway sorry for the bad English there, but I just wanted to share my story.

My mother was raised differently from her half brothers, she was always surfing and roller skating at the pier as a teenager. Her brothers, however, lived with a swinging door of their fathers druggie women. Being poor in the ghetto desert of California influenced all of them toward gang life.  The oldest had a daughter that he loved deeply enough to create a better life for both of them despite his drug ridden past. The second oldest joined the military and picked up the banjo, bluegrass saved his life from depression many times. Then Ray, the third oldest, was a towering refrigerator of a boy by the age of 12. Everyone who didn\u2019t know him treated him like a grown man because they simply couldn\u2019t tell he was just a child. He really took after his dad in his love and aspirations to the thug life. My mom and I tried to convince him that there was more than kill or be killed. He would live with us for a few weeks every summer. We would exchange his sagging, torn sweatpants for whatever was trendy. We let his shaven hair grow out and would get him a custom fade by the end of summer. We took him camping and we would have competitive beach clean ups to try and instill a love of nature. The last time we went camping, he had spent a while in the porta-potty and I went in after him. It said, \u201cWest side X wanted dead\u201d on the wall and I already knew it was him. The next morning I spotted sharpie stains on his fingers and I recited the graffiti to him. He was so surprised that I figured it out, he asked me how I knew that quote. I told him he shouldn't have been wasting his time, breathing shit air, just to create a sign no one would see. That was the last time I saw him. Today, just 4 years later, I was told that he had been shot and died in the ambulance on the way to the hospital. I feel so angry, we fucking tried our damndest to save him and his father allowed him to return to the gang life every time he left us. Now my grandfather can't afford to bury his 17 year old. We fucking begged him to help his son for so many years. His brothers are trying to scrape together money for the funeral.

I also want to clarify that I do not hold prejudice toward any ethnic or socioeconomic group, I'm a white passing Latina raised by a single mom who cleaned houses to keep me clothed and fed. I just know a dangerous lifestyle from a cool, urban one and I only wanted a hopeful life for my little uncle.

I was 28, in my last six months of grad school, working full time as well as interning, and he had been diagnosed with metastatic lung cancer (which would later turn to a diagnosis of adrenal cancer as a result of Agent Orange in Vietnam) less than 8 months before. It all happened so quickly... after a short stay in the hospital he was gone. \n\nEvery year, in the hours before his death, I become extremely contemplative. I wonder what my life would be like if he were here, how my mom's life would be different, how my family would be so much more functional. I think about how he was the glue who held us together. He wasn't my biological sperm donor, but he was my daddy and the most important person in my world. He was the nurturer in my family, the one who I went to for hugs, but also for a good political debate, and to share the new beers I discovered as Denver's craft brew scene quickly grew. \n\nI grew up Catholic and am still involved on the periphery (he sure wasn't... he referred to mass as \"stand up, sit down, pray pray pray\" but he showed up to all my school masses, first communions, confirmation... he never missed anything). I don't necessarily believe in the intercession of the saints, but around this time of year I find myself almost praying to him, asking for his guidance, for his support, for his forgiveness for me not being there enough for him at the end. I apologize every year for being too scared, too sad, to be there enough.

I\u2019m going to tell this to the best of my ability and memory. I feel like having a bit of context will help you understand. I lived with my grandmother for most of my life, my parents were homeless so they didn\u2019t live with us. My mother committed Suicide when I was very young, around 6 or 7 I can\u2019t remember. I never knew my mom that well, I still know next to nothing about her. After she died my dad decided he wanted to be a larger part of my life and started living with my grandma and I. It was good to have him home. I have him to thank for turning me into the man I am today. Without him I prolly would of killed myself long ago. Jump to freshman year of high school my dad is diagnosed with cancer and suffered with staph infection which nearly killed him. The following two years my dad went through a hard battle with chemo and his own Demons. Summer of sophomore year my dad was put on hospice with only a few months to live. He had cancer everywhere, in his spine and organs. He couldn\u2019t even walk anymore, he had a bed and some kind of machine in the living room. One day I get up in the morning and find my grandma and my dads girlfriend at the time in the living room around my dad crying. I instantly knew what was happening, my dad was dying in front of me. We sat and cried through it all, his last words, his passing and the removal of his body. I could only imagine how hard it was for my grandmother, no parent should bury their child. That did a heavy toll on my grandma, she developed dementia, and colon cancer which got removed and replaced with a colostomy bag that I had to change and maintain. It got to the point that she forgot my name. She wouldn\u2019t eat anything but breakfast sandwiches and key lime pie yogurt. It made me furious watching my family fall apart. One time after arguing with my grandma about her diet she said she just wanted to die and I got so mad I kicked a hole in the hallway. Instantly regretted it. One day my grandma got taken to the hospital via ambulance. This wasn\u2019t new to me, she would get taken there every once and a while. I was sitting in my room waiting for my late dads gf to take me to the hospital when she comes in bawling and tells me that grandma passed in the hospital. I actually don\u2019t know what she succumbed to. Now I\u2019m the only one left to carry my family name.

In life, you have ups and downs with family, friends and significant others. But in this case it was a double whammy: losing someone I had dated for about 8 years and losing someone who is my age (26). There is an unnatural feeling losing someone so young and so suddenly. It puts your whole world into perspective. How could this happen? We had our whole lives ahead of us. This isn\u2019t how it was supposed to happen. Then on top of that, someone I had grown up with and loved. Someone who I thought I would marry when we were young and had no worries in the world. The past two years we had not been in contact. He had some issues with drugs, and it seemed to have gotten worse throughout our relationship. There was lying, cheating, and eventually it had taken its toll. I didn\u2019t want it to end, but I knew I did all that I could to try to help and he had to figure it out on his own. At first we stayed in touch and we both only wanted the best for each other.. but then the conversation slowly fizzled. And boom. 2018- I get the worst text I\u2019ve ever gotten in my life. His mother texted me on a Sunday morning, November 4th: \u201cWe lost Connor.\u201d This had to be a joke, I thought. I couldn\u2019t believe it. I called her confused and the moment she answered the phone I blacked out. It had all hit. Connor was gone. He had gone out to a party the night before and mixed Xanax, cocaine, and alcohol and went to bed. The next week, and month for that matter, was a blur. Did this actually happen? I\u2019m just in a nightmare\u2014 and I need to wake up.\n\tAfter we broke up, I always wanted the best for Connor. He did stupid things in our relationship, but I was one of his biggest fans. I wanted him to get through this, but God had different plans. On top of the emotional strain of losing someone my age who shouldn\u2019t have died, and someone that I had loved... I felt another wave of grief: Our relationship. After we broke up I think I put up a wall. I didn\u2019t date anyone seriously and didn\u2019t want the emotional toll of a relationship. I mean at 26, this is the only relationship I ever knew. There were amazing times and tough times... and I blocked it out after we broke up. But did I ever deal with it? I don\u2019t think so. \n\tLosing an ex is something that not many people can relate to. You think back at all of the fun times and then a dark cloud of bad times comes through. Why am I thinking of these bad times? It doesn\u2019t matter anymore. He/She is gone. But the reality is: it was part of your relationship. There is a reason you both broke up, but what if it turned out differently? Could I have done more to help him? What if one decision throughout our relationship could have changed the way things turned out. The memories in your mind come with 10 follow up questions. \n\tGrieving someone you lost is a constant struggle everyday until you find a way to cope. Grieving someone who is an ex, someone who is so young, to something that could have been avoided: it\u2019s overwhelming. I have a great support system during this difficult time, but there are only a small group who know the feeling of grieving an ex. I hope if you are grieving an ex or someone young to something sudden that this helps. It\u2019s hard to process emotions with people who have no idea what you are feeling, but know that you\u2019re not alone. ", "subreddit": "GriefSupport"}
{"post_id": "algi5l", "created_utc": 1548877076, "title": "My mom lost her husband and I am emotionally done", "author": "askingforfriendxyz", "self_text": "Dear Reddit,\n\nI apologize for this long post in advance, but I don't know what to do anymore.\n\nMy stepfather died in a motorcycle accident 5 days before Christmas. Him and my mom have been married for 9 years. While he wasn't a father figure to me, he was a really good friend, brought me to travels with him and my mom and overall provided and cared for her. They live in Germany while I live in the U.S. with my dad. Anyway, he died unexpected and once I got the news, I booked a ticket and flew over to Germany right away. Luckily my mom has a big family and some of her siblings came over and stayed with her. Over the holidays we had many people here to kind of \"distract\" from the accident a little bit, but obviously it's always the topic. In the beginning I didn't even recognize my mom anymore. She was a completely different character. About a week and a half after his death we had the funeral ceremony, though without the urne because the accident occurred in Thailand and due to bureaucracy it would take a while until we would get his remains back. So that is the backstory. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHere is why I am emotionally finished.\n\nEvery night, in the first couple weeks also in the afternoons, my mom would basically flip a switch and go into the griefing mode. While she is in that mode, she walks around like a zombie and just weeps. In the first week, my uncle, aunt, cousin, mom and I were watching a movie, when she stood up, walked into the kitchen, grabbed a knife and held it to her wrist. I jumped up, yelled to drop the knife, took it out of her hands and it was like I grabbed her out of her  (I call it) vegetable state. My uncle said we can't help her anymore, because we are griefing ourselves and are no professionals. So we called the crisis intervention team and they said it was too late that day to do anything (it was like 11pm). However, they could send a team in the morning or if we feel like she is really likely to kill herself, we need to call the police and they would bring her to a psychiatric hospital. After the woman said that on speaker phone (we did it so my mom wouldn't feel like we are talking behind her back, but rather include her) my mom was panicking, because she didn't want to get taken away and said she will promise not to hurt herself. After this, she didn't attempt it anymore, but once my mom and I were alone, she would still go back into the griefing phase every night and tell me over and over again, that she didn't want to live anymore. So this is problem number one, because I am her son and I don't want my mom to constantly tell me that. She also keeps saying that she has no reason to live anymore even right next to me when she clearly has me and many other things to live for. It makes me somewhat mad, because I dropped everything to be there for her (I took 4 months off to help her out) and she thinks just about herself right now. At the same time I'm not mad, because I can't even begin to imagine how much it must hurt to lose someone you loved and lived with for so long.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow on top of that, as I mentioned she keeps saying confusing nonsense when she is in her vegetable state. And she keeps repeating every single day that he (being my step dad) doesn't like it cold and he has it so cold. First while he was waiting for 2 weeks to be cremated in Bangkok, and now that he is cremated she kept thinking of his ashes going into the hole where it's cold again. Today we burried the urne in a small family circle and she kept saying all day that he doesn't want to be in the hole cause he doesn't like it cold. I have been telling her for weeks now that he doesn't have it cold, because he is with her and in her heart where it's always warm and full of love. But she just doesn't listen. Yesterday, she told me in the evening that she has this plan where at the burrial of the urne I am to distract everyone, while she grabs the urne and runs away with it and then has it at her home so he doesn't have to freeze. I told her that this was impossible and if she does that she would act incredibly selfish towards his 3 children who lost their father. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe last issue is that my mom also smokes and drinks. Now the smoking isn't that much of an issue. She smokes maybe 10-15 cigarettes a day. However, since his death, my mom has been drinking a bottle of wine every evening. And because we have confronted her about this, she no hides a bottle in her bedroom and finishes it over the course of the night. She has been drinking more excessive over the past years since the relationship between my mom and my stepdad wasn't very easy. Family and friends have always confronted her but her usual reaction is: I have everything under control. \n\nI can see how alcohol may help her sleep, but it also hurts her and I believe it's the trigger to all these \"fantasies.\" I don't think she is a heavy alcoholic, because she never drinks before 4-5pm and it's not like she wakes up and is shivering, waiting to get her first alcohol. During the day she is the mom that I used to know. No smoking, no drinking, no grieving. Come 8-9pm (it used to start way earlier like 2pm), she is her worse enemy. And I am just at the end. I found her a wonderful psychiatrist with whom she has talked over the phone twice so far. I keep pushing her to go, because I can't help her besides being there for her, but she just refuses to see or talk to her and thinks she can't help her. (which I know is nonsense, because my mom had a burnout for the past 3 months before the death of her husband and has been going to a psychiatrist who really helped her with that).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnyway, what am I supposed to do? I am alone, in Germany, a country I am not familiar with anymore since I left 6 years ago, with my griefing mother who is not herself (at nights). I am sometimes so fucking mad at her for the things she says without thinking first how others feel about what she says and that she needs to stop fucking drinking.

I don't feel weird writing that out anymore, in general I feel like I feel less weird about it than I'm supposed to. When he died I didn't scream, I didn't cry every day or do any of the things I often read about people doing when I search for material on grief. I knew he was going to die. It was still a shock when it happened, but it was not unexpected, and in a way it was almost relieving. All I could think of was how a long and painful process was finally over, a chapter of my life was over and it was time to turn a new page in which me and my family could begin moving forward. \n\nI feel like to me personally, the reason why his actual death didn't affect me so much... is that in a way my grieving process began much earlier. My grief began months before he died, when I truly understood that he was never going to get better again. I was 19 when he was first diagnosed and he died about a month before my 22nd birthday, and like a child I naively believed that surely, things would turn out fine in the end. In a way, coming to terms with the fact that things weren't going to turn out fine was harder than accepting the actual death. My mom explained the situation to me as I was about to get on the train back to uni, and I think I needed my mom to tell me for it to finally click in my head that recovery was no longer an option. I spent most of my time on the train that night crying, the first time I had ever cried about my dad's illness. My dad was still alive at the time, but I felt like I was mourning the dad I used to have, the one who had a healthy mind and a healthy body, the dad who would take me hiking and skiing. So by the time he finally passed away... I feel like I had already had time to process and accept the fact that I had lost the father I grew up with. I cried in the hospital room and during the funeral, but other than that I mostly felt numb and weird, like my family had entered a separate world and I was looking at everyone around me through thick glass. It was strange, seeing people on the street living their normal life after my life had gotten turned upside down, and realizing that those strangers were possibly looking back at me thinking the exact same thing.  I wanted nothing more than to be done with the funeral so that I could return to the normal world and get started on the rest of my life.\n\nIn a weird way I feel like the passing of my dad has helped me. I used to be a very shy and anxious person, and on the last year semester of my degree I was too shy to talk to anyone in my class. While I still am shy and anxious some extent, this past semester I have become more social and daring than I ever thought possible. A parent dying was always one of the things I feared the most, and once it actually happened all my other anxieties seemed so small in comparison. Though this only happened after a brief period of intense anxiety about something happening to my remaining family. \n\nI hate to say it, but without the constant worry of my dad suddenly dying while I was away at uni and unable to say goodbye, I've been able to focus on myself and do better both socially and academically than I have since I found out about his diagnosis. Its as if his death has motivated me to \"seize the day\" or whatever and actually work on the parts of my personality that I was unhappy with before. I've also grown more cynical, though not to the extent where I only see negatives. The death of my father taught me that things don't always have a happy ending just cause you want them to, and that is a lesson I intend to take with me, even though some of my friends have expressed that they think thats a dangerously negative way of thinking.\n\nHowever...part of me feels like I'm kind of avoiding dealing with the pain. I look at what other people have written here and I don't recognise the constant crying, the loss of meaning, the undescribable pain. I've been more focused on my daily life and working on myself and celebrating what good has come into my life. I feel like I only really grieve whenever I decide to. When I decide to let those feelings in, when I deliberately seek out material that will trigger an emotional reaction, I can scream and cry for hours. But it almost feels more like a mechanical reaction than an emotional one, I'll cry but on the inside I don't even feel anything in particular. I've gotten used to the idea of my father not being around anymore. I miss him, but I also know that me and my family will be able to move forward without him. I'm happy to remember the good times I had with him, but I don't want to sit around talking about how sad it is that he died. Frankly, it almost makes me mad when people give me empty phrases like \"everything happens for a reason\" and \"he's in a better place now\". I don't really care where he is now, he's not here and that's all that matters. I don't feel the need to dwell on the negative things that have already been weighing on me for the past 2 years, I just want to get on with my life and keep moving forward as fast as possible. \n\n(I'm sorry, I know that this was more a vent than an actual question)", "subreddit": "GriefSupport"}

No one understands how hard of a situation this has been. \n\nI've had really kind friends tell me about how they lost grandparents and stuff, but it just isn't the same kind of loss. I don't really have anyone supporting me or there for me since we stopped dating. I don't mean to sound selfish, but it isn't the same situation as losing a grandparent cause most of the time the family all grieves together. I find myself questioning if I even have the right to grieve so heavily. Again, I don't mean to step on anyone's toes. Losing an ex is just different. There's no one for me to grieve with but myself. \n\nI understand why people would think I shouldn't care so much, but I can't really control these emotions that are stemming from the grief. It's almost like I'm grieving more than normal since I am alone in this. This is the first time I've lost someone I actually was close to at a point in time. (I've lost a grandparent, but I was so young we didn't have a relationship. My other grandparent was across the states so I was more grieving for my parents who lost their parent.) He and I were high school sweethearts. We dated for 2 years into college. We were each other's first love. Even though we didn't work out we still wished eachother the best and kept in touch. \n\n\nI also grieve for the accident itself. He was so young when he died. Only 20. A selfish drunk driver decided he was fine to drive and hit him while he was walking on a side walk. I was really close to his family too so it was so hard seeing them go through everything.  \n\nI also get really sensitive when people trash talk their ex's. I know i'm taking it personally and I shouldn't. I would just give anything for my ex to still be alive cause you never know when someone will take their last breath. I'm just still learning to cope I guess. \n\nAfter time passed I reconnected with his family. I see them a few times a year when I am in town. We don't really talk about the accident though.
